8075,study region four districts meinong qishan dashu and daliao of kaohsiung city southern taiwan study focus the understanding of aquifer recharge in terms of water table response to rainfall is of critical importance to groundwater systems management and various endeavors have been made to estimate the amount of recharge using rainfall data the purpose of this study is to evaluate the groundwater level response to rainfall and determine the recharge potential for shallow aquifers we showed a simple approach to estimate specific yield s y and hydraulic conductivity k as functions of rainfall and water level data new hydrological insights for the region correlation method is applied to investigate groundwater level response to associated rainfall and it was found that the rise in water table linearly depends on the rainfall amount per event results show the annual recharge rates of 244 1472 mm year 1 which represent 12 43 of rainfall in the study area the estimated k order of 10 4 to 10 5 m s 1 and s y 0 20 0 51 were used as prior values to setup groundwater numerical modeling using wash123d the real time case scenario simulation using pumping and rainfall data indicated the reasonable hydrological response of groundwater levels to rainfall the long term simulations should be performed with wash123d to deal with the subjectivity of sustained groundwater pumping and sustainability of aquifers for better groundwater resource planning and management graphical abstract ga1 keywords water table fluctuation recession analysis specific yield hydraulic conductivity groundwater modeling wash123d 1 introduction long term groundwater level measurements and monitoring from observation wells provide principal information about aquifer behavior such as recharge discharge and storage phenomena under hydrological stresses alley and taylor 2001 cuthbert 2014 neto et al 2016 wu et al 2021 the systematic groundwater level measurements are the source of essential data that is required for the evaluation of changes in groundwater resources over time groundwater numerical modeling and forecasting and to design implement and monitor the effectiveness of groundwater management and protection programs taylor and alley 2001 there is a dynamic balance between groundwater recharge storage and discharge aquifer recharge for a rainfall event can be estimated from water table rise hsu and li 2020 kotchoni et al 2019 the water table rise in response to rainfall is a complex phenomenon because it is a function of many factors such as hydraulic conductivity k specific yield s y groundwater level gwl lateral groundwater flow antecedent moisture conditions land cover evapotranspiration et and rainfall intensity and volume rainfall data is an important factor in recharge estimation shi et al 2015 and has been identified as the primary factor affecting groundwater level crosbie et al 2005 park and parker 2008 gaalen et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 commonly there is assumption related to linear relationship between water table responses to rainfall in unconfined aquifers gaalen et al 2013 wu et al 1996 however this assumption may miss much of the variability in the system driven by the terrain heterogeneity and unsaturated zone fluxes healy and scanlon 2010 many literature studies described the relationship between water table response to rainfall using empirical and theoretical frameworks these methods were suitable mainly for shallow groundwater where there is a close correspondence between individual rainfall events and water table fluctuations depending on the system rainfall recharge relationships have been defined using linear or nonlinear relationships wu et al 1996 estimated groundwater recharge by developing linear regression model between water table response and associated rainfall recharge is estimated from observed groundwater level fluctuations and there is a linear relationship between rainfall and groundwater fluctuations e g kotchoni et al 2019 rama et al 2018 cai and ofterdinger 2016 jassas and merkel 2014 obuobie et al 2012 sibanda et al 2009 jan et al 2007 restrepo et al 2006 tan et al 2007 healy and cook 2002 nonlinear behavior has been also explored in rainfall recharge evaluations for example tan et al 2006 developed nonlinear regression model between rainfall recharge relationship park and parker 2008 theoretically explained the rise of water level in shallow aquifers as recharge by a physically based water table fluctuation model in the application of this model the recharge rate was dominantly influenced by the nonlinearity of unsaturated water content and permeability park 2012 gaalen et al 2013 assessed the nonlinear behavior by investigating the water table response to rainfall as a function of antecedent water level and rainfall event depth other scientists also demonstrated a nonlinear relationship between rainfall and recharge such as taylor et al 2013 and cobb et al 2017 cobb and harvey 2019 estimated hydraulic parameters k s y using rising and recession curves of water table by interpreting nonlinear function of both parameters with respect to groundwater level groundwater hydrographs generally represent the changes in water levels over time and the analysis can yield potentially hydraulic properties of aquifer such as specific yield recession constant and hydraulic conductivity park et al 2011 cuthbert 2014 crosbie et al 2019 however not all water level changes are caused by rainfall to become recharge while other factors as explained above in the first paragraph need to be minimized or removed from the water level signal crosbie et al 2005 in the literature studies the scientists adopted different approaches to minimize these factors such as in event base water balance approach for sy estimation the runoff et and change in soil moisture were assumed negligible to become recharge equal to the precipitation delin et al 2007 fan et al 2014 seraphin et al 2018 in time series model crosbie et al 2005 introduced drainage term through recession analysis that lumped the combined effects of et ocean or earth tides lateral flow to the aquifer boundaries air entrapment moisture content of the unsaturated zone and noise from pressure transducers nimmo et al 2015 cai and ofterdinger 2016 rama et al 2018 crosbie et al 2019 kotchoni et al 2019 in regression approach armstrong and narayan 1998 relationship is developed with a series of event calculations that fits a line through the rise in water table and event rainfall where the intercept is the threshold rainfall before recharge begins and the inverse of the slope is the sy gaalen et al 2013 rama et al 2018 cobb and harvey 2019 this threshold rainfall is lumped as initial water loss i e interception runoff et and soil moisture storage and needs to be overcome by subtracting from rainfall before recharge will begin rama et al 2018 crosbie et al 2019 for effective groundwater resource management during wet and dry season in a basin information related to hydraulic property distributions which controls water movement and its distributions in the basin is essential with this information the recharge rate can be delineated with water table fluctuation wtf method or groundwater numerical models for water resources management through estimation prediction and scenario analysis of surface water and groundwater systems the prior estimation of hydraulic parameters k s y is required for this purpose while these parameters cab be calibrated while fitting a simulated gwl to observed gwl park 2012 wtf method has been undertaken since the 1920s crosbie et al 2019 and is one of the widely used methods to quantify rainfall recharge rama et al 2018 masetti et al 2016 this method is applied for shallow unconfined aquifers in event basis approach delin et al 2007 for accurate quantification of recharge the time should be event based s y value should be appropriate and other influencing factors on groundwater fluctuations not related to recharging must be isolated healy and scanlon 2010 acharya et al 2012 neto et al 2016 the sy is uncertain and appropriate estimation is difficult the overestimation of sy leads to overestimation of recharge therefore sy should be treated as conceptual parameter that could be calibrated crosbie et al 2019 for example with known recharge from observed groundwater level the prior sy can be estimated to calculate the unknown recharge using wtf method this approach is more valid on event basis assuming that the time period is short enough that runoff and et can be ignored leaving recharge equal to precipitation seraphin et al 2018 fan et al 2014 delin et al 2007 this method can lead to an overestimation of sy crosbie et al 2019 another is the regression method to estimate sy by developing the relationship between water table rises in response to series of event rainfall armstrong and narayan 1998 cobb and harvey 2019 the inverse of the slope of the fitting line gives the value of s y rama et al 2018 gaalen et al 2013 and the intercept is the threshold rainfall considered as initial water loss as the sum of interception runoff et and change in soil moisture storage this threshold rainfall is subtracted from series of event rainfall and then prior estimation of sy is done some literature studies adopted inverse modeling of water table with temporal varying sy to calculate recharge time series park and parker 2008 park 2012 jeong and park 2017 sy can also be estimated based on falling recession of groundwater hydrograph due to pumping for irrigation over the dry season mar√©chal et al 2006 chinnasamy et al 2018 the recession part of groundwater hydrograph in the absence of recharge generally takes exponential form due to fast and slow recession periods the rate of recession recession constant can be used to calculate aquifer properties i e transmissivity using rorabaugh 1964 equation the recession analysis of groundwater hydrograph using master recession curve mrc is a viable tool to represent the recession rate i e the recession hydrograph slope over time nimmo and perkins 2018 the matching strip method is one of the most prominent method for the mrc determination carlotto and chaffe 2019 the prior estimated hydraulic parameters such as hydraulic conductivity k can be calibrated in physics based hydrological models for modeling groundwater system of regional area distributed integrated hydrological models coupling surface with groundwater processes are considered optimal tools for groundwater resources management coupled surface subsurface models include e g wash123d yeh et al 1998 inhm vanderkwaak and loague 2001 modhms panday and huyakorn 2004 mike she graham and butts 2005 parflow surface flow kollet and maxwell 2006 and pihm qu and duffy 2007 gsflow markstrom et al 2008 hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2010 cathy camporese et al 2010 paws shen and phanikumar 2010 tribs ofm kim et al 2012 and flush warsta et al 2013 these advanced generation models tend to be data intensive and their reliability is largely constrained by the availability and quality of input data among these models wash123d was selected in this study because of its availability and applications in many river basins of taiwan for groundwater assessment and flood simulation wash123d is an integrated multimedia multiprocess physics based watershed model suitable for various spatio temporal scales yeh et al 2011 moreover it is one of the most appropriate protocol to simulate surface water groundwater interactions based on full st venant equations 1 d 2 d and 3 d richards equation shih et al 2019 has used wash123d to assess groundwater flow and pumping effect and huang and shih 2020 applied this model to simulate seasonal groundwater levels in the area of southern taiwan the obtained results were stable because simulated groundwater level corresponds with observed one very well that indicating the satisfactory performance of wahs123d in selected study area of taiwan the performance of the model was also assessed in flood inundation forecasting for disaster reduction in taiwan river basins for example flood estimation and forecasting during typhoons in langyang creek basin shih and yeh 2011 shih et al 2012a 2014 hsiao et al 2013 coastal inundation in eastern and mid western coast shih et al 2012b hsu et al 2017 the effect of land use and climate change on flow regimes in fengshan creek basin wu and shih 2018 hussain et al 2021a conducted a study in fengshan creek basin northern taiwan for 1 h ahead flood level forecasting using wash123d and support vector machine svm model more detail about wash123d modeling capacity capabilities and literature publications that assessed surface flow groundwater flow sediment and salinity transport are available in hussain 2021 according to our understanding there is a need for groundwater use regulations in the area of southern taiwan during dry seasons because of less available surface water supply there is a common practice of over pumping and excess use of groundwater for the fulfilment of water demand this is inducing serious regional land subsidence and seawater intrusion along with derived social and economic issues hsu et al 2015 tran and wang 2020 therefore effective management of groundwater resources is needed to not only consider and treat the groundwater as a whole but also take into account the interactions between surface and groundwater at varied spatio temporal scale the simulation of surface and groundwater coupled flows in the watershed system using physics based groundwater models can provide a reference to the exploration operations and regulations of groundwater resources in decision making also deprived of knowing the pumping locations and history the numerical simulations look to be the only way to establish a link between the drops in groundwater levels with unregulated illegal pumping khan et al 2017 shih et al 2019 therefore the present paper aims to study the water table response to rainfall and simulate groundwater level using wash123d model the study is based on the field observation data of observation well stations and rain gauge stations in sub regional area of kaohsiung city taiwan we simply used long term groundwater level and rainfall data and developed the water table response to rainfall relationship to estimate the specific yield the matching strip method was used to develop mrc at each site on a semi logarithmic plot the slope of the line indicates recession constant and it was used to estimate hydraulic conductivity these prior estimated parameters were used to set up surface water groundwater numerical model we selected wash123d model as the most appropriate protocol to simulate coupled 2 d overland 3 d groundwater flow system the model was used for the simulation of real time case scenarios using pumping and rainfall data to understand the pumping effects on groundwater levels this study is unique in terms of its application and methodology because we introduce a simple approach to estimate hydraulic parameters of a shallow aquifer and then these parameters were tested to calculate the recharge potential of the study aquifer and groundwater flow simulation using real time case scenario data 2 study area description this study is conducted in a sub regional area of kaohsiung city consisting of four districts namely meinong qishan dashu and daliao as shown in fig 1a which covers approximately 594 km2 the topography gradually varied from sea level to 951 m from the south coast to north central mountain range the average annual rainfall of the area is approximately 2500 mm and around 69 of that rainfall occurred in may to october months the outcropped formation is shown in fig 1b generally the formation is comprised of sedimentary rocks and their ages vary from the holocene and pleistocene quaternary to the pliocene and miocene neogene the youngest lithology is the holocene less than 11 700 years and it consists of deposits from the western foothills and the central range brought by the modern channel to lower elevations the holocene alluvium and the terrace deposits consist of gravel sand and mud the pleistocene formations between 11 700 and 2 58 million years include the linkou and liugui conglomerates and the tashe formation the linkou conglomerate consists mainly of clastic support while the liugui conglomerate consists of matrix support the tashe formation consists of thick mudstones with interbedded sandstone and conglomerates the pleistocene formations are weakly cemented and are usually not heavily jointed the hydraulic conductivity is slightly lower than that of the holocene sediments but generally higher than that of the neogene miocene to pliocene bedrocks the geological investigation indicated that all of the aquifers are connected an unconfined and three confined aquifers namely f1 layer 1 f2 f3 1 and f3 2 layer 4 were identified from shallow to 200 m depth fig 1c there are 13 observation wells and 13 basins inside the study area fig 1a meinong district geology formation is holocene alluvium and terrace and pleistocene liugui conglomerate and has meinong jiyang and jiyang gz observation wells qishan district has two observation wells qishan and zhongzhou in terrace formation dashu district has three observation wells xipu dashu jiuqu in alluvium formation near pleistocene linkou conglomerate daliao district has two wells chaoliao and zhaoming inside alluvium formation near pleistocene tashe formation the study area is unique in terms of groundwater problems because there is no official joint surface groundwater regulation and management for comprehensive groundwater use regulation and rules there is a need for a proper monitoring network to devise policy regarding water allocation and rights the preceding projects of water resources agency wra lack the accurate estimation of groundwater abstraction amount over the years 3 materials and methods 3 1 data acquisition and processing long term 2001 2019 monitoring data on daily basis from 17 rainfall stations and 13 groundwater level stations were collected from wra website https gweb wra gov tw hydroinfo id index the example of available groundwater level and rainfall data is shown in fig 6 at qishan xipu and zhaoming locations after collection of required data the processing has been done to identify rainfall event size and duration water table response in terms of rising in water level due to that event and lag time delay between maximum rainfall and the resulting maximum rise in water level the dataset required for 2 d 3 d transient numerical simulation with wash123d include hydrogeological pumping and groundwater levels meteorological rainfall and physiographic digital elevation model land use cover soil type and outcrop formation databases the necessary input data was acquired from government agencies such as the physiographic data was collected from an open data source of ministry of interior and central geological survey cgs ministry of economic affairs taiwan 3 2 water table response to rainfall the relationship between rainfall events and the resulting water table level rise is defined here as recharge in terms of response to rainfall in the study area the occurrence of rainfall during rainy season may to october happens in cluster form i e there is a continuous rainfall for 7 10 days under different intensity due to tropical typhoons and low pressure gradient zones hussain et al 2021b therefore the event size consists of concentrated rainfall cluster a group of continuous rainfall events that together generate a peak in groundwater level the water table response associated with individual rainfall events was accounted for using the procedure of wu et al 1996 the water table response is the difference between water level rise to peak and before water level subsequently started to drop by identifying rainfall events and responses for each site the correlation using best fitting line approach was computed between associated rainfall and rise in water level as water table response the correlation coefficient r2 was used to evaluate the strength of this regression analysis the regression equation of each site obtained through this relationship rainfall per event vs water table response provides important aquifer parameters such as specific yield response threshold and response ratio best fit slope gaalen et al 2013 crosbie et al 2019 for the prior estimation of sy we adopted the regression procedure proposed by armstrong and narayan 1998 the rises of water table from series of rainfall events at borehole scale were calculated the plot of water table response vs associated rainfall per event was drawn for each site where the intercept is the threshold rainfall before recharge begins armstrong and narayan 1998 crosbie et al 2005 the response threshold represents the water loss which is the amount of rainfall that occurs before any water table response is seen and was calculated by finding x intercept of the best fitting line the positive value of x intercept represents all other water losses such as soil moisture variation canopy interception evapotranspiration and overland runoff flow in water balance approach the value below response threshold means no recharge reaches the groundwater a negative value for a response threshold is not meaningful and presumably reflects changes in the trend of the best fitting line driven by other factors gaalen et al 2013 after subtracting the threshold rainfall from series of events the sy was estimated by inverse of slope of line that fits through rise in water level and calculated rainfall other researchers also adopted a similar water balance approach to estimate sy such as disregarding other complexities the inverse of slope of response vs rainfall line is specific yield gaalen et al 2013 similarly rama et al 2018 used the regression best fit line and equation in rainfall and water table fluctuation plot to estimate specific yield by taking the inverse of the slope of the fitting line in graph cobb and harvey 2019 also estimated the specific yield by fitting the rising curve water level vs rainfall depth and taking the inverse of line slope our prior estimated sy values at borehole scale were compared with observed values and from morris and johnson 1967 other parameters such as mean lag time between peak rainfall and peak water table response water level fluctuation range and rainfall range minimum maximum and mean of time series were also computed for a more physical understanding of aquifer behavior at each site 3 3 recession analysis and hydraulic parameters the methodology adopted in this study for prior estimation of hydraulic conductivity k of shallow aquifer is based on groundwater recession analysis gis analysis and rorabaugh 1964 equation rorabaugh 1964 developed an equation that relates the slope of groundwater recession recession constant to the transmissivity and specific yield of the groundwater aquifer the derived equation was formulated for recession of groundwater level based on simple aquifer geometry and boundary conditions rorabaugh model can be adopted with certain assumptions 1 the aquifer is considered to be thick relative to change in water table caused by recharge 2 aquifer is isotropic and homogeneous 3 aquifer is underlain by impermeable layer rutledge 2006 the applicability of rorabaugh model was assessed according to fig 1 it was observed that alluvium formation aquifer f1 is up to 40 m thick and underlain by impermeable layer moreover the location of observation wells in same alluvium formation indicates homogenous aquifer with this knowledge the prior estimation of k in alluvium aquifer was done according to rorabaugh model as given in eq 1 1 t s y 0 933 b 2 ln h 1 h 2 t 2 t 1 where h 1 and h 2 are the groundwater levels at time t 1 and t 2 during the period of recession respectively t is the transmissivity s y is the specific yield and b is the aquifer half width which is the average distance from the stream to the hydrologic divide in eq 1 the slope of master recession curve mrc segment is recession constant Œ± ln h 1 h 2 t 2 t 1 so eq 1 can be rearranged as 2 t s y b 2 Œ± 1 071 to calculate the hydraulic conductivity of each site eq 2 was further rearranged by incorporating t kd where k is hydraulic conductivity and d is effective aquifer depth the following equation was obtained to estimate the hydraulic conductivity 3 k b 2 Œ± s y 1 071 d the values of s y was already estimated via slope of regression line between rise in groundwater level associated with rainfall event while the Œ± value was calculated from groundwater recession analysis in any aquifer the individual recession segments recorded at different times may have different slopes depending on the variability in storage evaporation loss and recharge rate posavec et al 2006 therefore it is necessary to compile all individual recessions into a single curve called master recession curve mrc that represents an average characterization of groundwater level matching strip method is a graphical method used here to construct the mrc of each site this method is based on exponential model that overlaps individual plotted recession segments by horizontal adjustment to form a single recession curve representative of long data series snyder 1939 for the recession analysis of groundwater at each site the long term daily groundwater level data was processed by separating it into two parts based on wet rainy and dry non rainy seasons and only the dry season november to april groundwater level data was used to construct mrcs in addition the groundwater levels corresponding to rainfall data points were eliminated the recession segments were selected by assuming a minimum length of 7 days with a rate of change between consecutive groundwater levels in this way we only have drops of curves that transformed more closely to the groundwater flow the drop down curves were sorted from the highest to lowest according to initial value of each drop down segment and moved together to obtain master curve the best trend line logarithmic or linear was fitted for the obtained master curve at each site based on highest r2 value according to the boussinesq model the mrc should be a straight line on a semi logarithmic plot and the slope of this straight line is represented as recession constant day 1 however in a long time series data it is not possible to get straight lines recession curves and the solution is to separate into several short straight line segments liu et al 2016 for mrcs during drought periods two straight line segments can be obtained by neglecting the recharge from reservoirs or open channels that have significant storage during rainy season fiorillo 2014 and chen et al 2012 interpreted these segments as fast high water table drainage rapid depletion from high permeability fractures and as low water table drainage slow depletion from low permeability fractures in this study the same methodology was adopted to separate the mrcs into two straight line segments i e rapid Œ± 1 and slow Œ± 2 depletions to calculate the recession constant values of both segments both recession values were estimated via slope of mrcs segments in semi logarithmic graph the values of other unknown parameters of eq 3 such as aquifer half width b a 2 l which is the average distance from the stream to the hydrologic divide this was estimated with the help of digital elevation model dem data in geographical information system gis environment in arcgis 10 2 using arc hydro tools thirteen sub basins were delineated based on dem data related to each site as shown in fig 1a the drainage area a and total stream length l of each basin were calculated to obtain the value of b the values of effective aquifer depth d of each site was taken from hussain et al 2021c published in hydrological sciences journal where they reasonably estimated d values using borehole lithology and dem data after getting all the parameters values of eq 3 the hydraulic conductivity of each site was estimated by indirect approach and was compared with field values obtained from central geological survey cgs 3 4 recharge calculation the full knowledge of observed groundwater level fluctuation can be used to calculate the recharge in unconfined aquifer kotchoni et al 2019 the water table fluctuation wtf method assumes that the rises of groundwater level in unconfined aquifer are controlled by the water recharge to drainage rate d t mathematically can be expressed as 4 r e s y h t d t 5 r e h i d t t i s y if t i p d 0 and h i d t t i 0 otherwise 0 according to eq 4 the groundwater recharge r e is estimated by the change in water table height h build up during after a rainfall event over time t times the specific yield s y healy and cook 2002 crosbie et al 2005 improved the wtf method as represented in eq 5 to account for the drainage effect using the rainfall and groundwater level time series data in eq 5 p d is daily accumulated rainfall and subscript i represents all intervals available in the dataset d t is estimated based on observed recessions in groundwater levels during no rain over multiple days it is the function of water table height and was determined by a linear fitting process of daily water level decline to its corresponding water table height s y values were estimated and compared with field values and representative values provided by morris and johnson 1967 the comparable value of s y was used to calculate the recharge per rainfall event of each site the information about geological materials was obtained from cgs website https hydro moeacgs gov tw map zh tw as shown in fig 1c according to morris and johnson 1967 the s y value for coarse gravel to fine gravel material ranges 0 21 0 28 while coarse sand to fine sand ranges 0 30 0 33 for silt clay and sandstone the value of s y is 0 20 0 06 and 0 21 respectively after comparing the s y values at each site the recharge rate was calculated using eq 5 in rainy intervals only and corrected by all drainage effects lumped in d t including moisture content of the unsaturated zone at daily time step and yearly recharge was calculated by summing daily recharge 3 5 groundwater numerical modeling after finding out the hydrogeological parameter k the groundwater numerical modeling with pumping scenario was performed using physically based wash123d watershed model for this purpose the model setting was done with 2 d 3 d transient simulations in wash123d version 2 0 while the pre processing such as necessary input geometry files site characterization model conceptualization mesh generation and post processing was performed in gms environment manning s roughness n and hydraulic conductivity k are two basic hydraulic parameters for 2 d overland flow and 3 d groundwater flow simulation respectively these parameters are estimated before the initiation of numerical simulation the model was set up and defined various hydrogeological units based on the outcropped formation therefore the prior estimation of hydraulic conductivity was performed as discussed in above section the overland surface roughness parameter n values are based on land use and land cover classification and determined with reference to previous studies conducted in taiwan shih and yeh 2011 shih et al 2019 the values of manning s roughness coefficient for 2 d overland flow used in this study are presented in table 1 3 5 1 hydrogeological analysis and conceptual model development before the construction of numerical groundwater model it is important to understand the hydrogeological framework for the proper conceptualization of the flow system according to the cgs report from website https hydro moeacgs gov tw map zh tw and geologist suggestions such as from professor jia jyun dong graduate institute of applied geology national central university the subsurface strata can be divided into aquifer system from top to bottom namely aquifer 1 f1 aquitard 1 t1 aquifer 2 f2 aquitard 2 t2 aquifer 3 1 f3 1 aquitard 3 t3 and aquifer 3 2 f3 2 as shown in fig 1c the meinong district outcrop formation the subsurface cross sectional view and a conceptual model fig 2a b an example for demonstration purposes the outcrop formation of meinong district consists of holocene alluvium and terrace deposition pleistocene luigui conglomerate early pliocene yanshui shale miocene changzhikeng layer and late miocene tangenshan sandstone according to the geologist and expert s opinions the holocene formations have higher hydraulic conductivity as compared to pleistocene and pliocene formations and it varies approximately one order reduction in magnitude from holocene to late miocene formations this provides relatively comparable information for the prior estimation of hydraulic conductivity in the study region the cross sectional view of sections aa and bb locations indicated the vertical distribution of formations and it is almost 300 m deep from surface elevation the core drilling data from cgs also indicated that the aquifer 1 f1 has almost 27 70 m depth while aquifer 2 f2 has up to 200 m depth at different locations in the study area the conceptual model describes the groundwater flow system numerically and identifies the hydrological and hydrogeological conditions and all important features and drivers of the groundwater system including sources sinks boundary conditions geophysical features that convey water or interrupt the flow recharge site stratigraphy material properties etc to simulate groundwater flow adequately in the region the detailed hydrogeological framework was simplified into a conceptual model that incorporates the important regional scale features of the groundwater system the conceptual model consists of four aquifers separated by three confining units total 14 vertical layers have been used to conceptualize the quasi 3d groundwater flow i e the horizontal flow occurs only within the aquifer layers and vertical flow occurs only between the aquifer layers the prior estimation of hydraulic conductivity using water table response to rainfall relationship mainly deals with aquifer 1 in holocene formation which comprised of different hydrogeological material characteristics such as coarse gravels a2 medium to fine gravels a1 coarse sand t medium to fine sand c and silt clay d1 while the mud layer fluvial deposits linkou conglomerate aquitards and other layers are expressed as independent units the hydraulic conductivity k in the lateral direction of other hydrogeological formation such as pleistocene pliocene to miocene as an initial guess was estimated from the information of alluvium formation due to non availability of observation wells in these formations the hydraulic conductivity values were comparatively supposed to use the hypothesis of alluvium to non alluvium formation i e the alluvium formation has good permeability than non alluvium formations the k values of linkou and tashe formations belong to pleistocene were assumed by one order and ¬Ω order reduction in magnitude from alluvium holocene formation respectively similarly for pliocene to miocene we reduce the k values up to 2 2 ¬Ω order magnitude from holocene these values were incorporated into model according to material defined in groundwater modeling system gms environment 3 5 2 mesh generation the conceptual model with all basic components that may affect groundwater flow is used to construct 3 d mesh or model grid for required simulations the mesh development process has been performed in gms aquaveo https www aquaveo com software gms groundwater modeling system introduction the 3 d unstructured finite element mesh was generated to begin with the development of 2 d triangular grids the predefined hydrogeological units land use data and the digital terrain model dtm was used for generating 2 d grids and mapping various input data to the grid nodes the simple 2 d generated mesh after corrections according to area outcrop formation was used for 3 d mesh generation as the topography hydrogeological unit s distribution is complex in the study area so the refinement of the 3 d mesh was also performed according to the complexity and known conditions for example the interface layer correction between aquifers and impermeable layers and in meinong district the stratum is syncline morphology and interbedding and distribution of different outcropped formations such is changchikeng layer tangenshan sandstone liugui conglomerate and terrace deposit is complex and corrected in 3 d mesh according to site similarly the qishan district mesh was refined according to different bedrock formations i e nanshilun sandstone kaitzuliao shale gutinkeng and wushan formations dashu district stratum dips roughly from northwest to southeast and its hydrogeological conditions include linkou conglomerate so the geometry dips eastward by about 10 15 degrees in 3 d mesh refinement with fine scale element size the 2 d overland mesh was discretized into 47 088 nodes and 46 580 elements while the 3 d groundwater model was divided into fourteen layers and geometry was discretized into 353 160 mesh nodes and 652 120 unstructured mesh elements the 3 d simulation modeling depth was approximately 440 m while the unstructured grid size range from 200 to 30 m fig 3 3 5 3 initial boundary conditions and input attributes of 2 d 3 d coverage various types of boundary conditions determined based on physical reasoning are essential to supplement the governing equations of wash123d the 2 d coverage mainly needs open surface boundary conditions and attributes such as specific depth specific stage and flux boundary in this study for 2 d coverage the time dependent water depth of zero as dirichlet boundary was applied so that no water was supposed to pass over the border boundary nodes while time dependent water stage of zero as tidal type dirichlet boundary was applied over the south along the coastline the rainfall is the only input force applied to 2 d coverage via thiessen polygon method in terms of rainfall rate meter per second the 3 d coverage needs the identification of border boundary nodes for initial enforced head attributes in this study the time dependent total head as dirichlet boundary prescribed head for 3 d simulation was adopted for that purpose idw inverse distance weighting method was used to interpolate the groundwater level data from observation wells and then set it as the constant head boundary the rainfall rate was used as a variable flux boundary for surface subsurface interaction the simulation was conducted with a finite element approach using 2 d depth average diffusive wave equation and 3 d richard s equation the governing equations are solved with semi lagrangian particle tracking approach and galerkin finite element methods to determine overland flow and variably saturated subsurface flow respectively for the selection of solver specification a point wise iterative matrix solver was used with nodal quadrature for the integration of an element side and an element for 2 d 3 d simulation number of 1000 linear iterations were allowed in the matrix solver with 10 3 m absolute error convergent criteria for steady state and transient simulation of 3 d flow while 50 iterations were allowed for 2 d overland flow simulation total 100 non linear iterations for 2 d 3 d simulation are allowed and computational time step sizes are 16 min for 3 d subsurface media and 1 5 min for 2 d overland regime only the principal diagonal k xx k yy and k zz hydraulic conductivity values were considered homogeneous hydraulic conductivity tensor while off diagonal terms k xy k xz and k yz are considered zero by assuming uniform material properties inside the layers and the relation between darcy velocity and the hydraulic gradient is referred to the principal axes the horizontal conductivities in x and y directions are considered the same k xx k yy while vertical conductivities were 10 of horizontal conductivities i e k zz 0 1k xx adopted from cheng et al 2006 and shih and yeh 2011 initial and boundary conditions must be identified for transient simulation the initial condition can be obtained from steady state simulation with constant boundary conditions yeh et al 2011 the steady state simulation must be based on field measurements in this study the same instructions were used for 2 d 3 d transient simulations the initial conditions were obtained by steady state simulation before truly beginning to run in transient mode for steady state simulation the 3 d starting conditions must match field measurement at starting condition in order to force that to happen we assign constant head boundary conditions to the 3 d border boundary nodes using idw interpolation technique this is called the initial enforced total head because it is only enforced in that steady state run after that run the boundary condition is ignored and the results are used as the initial condition for 3 d transient model the rainfall coverage is considered zero in steady state simulation while in 2d 3d coupled rainfall coverage is called variable flux couple that is similar to the initial enforced total head in a 2 d 3 d transient wash123d model the rainfall is only applied to the 2 d realm water only enters 3 d realm by infiltration so the rainfall is not applied to the 3 d mesh that is the reason we run the steady state initially to develop the starting conditions for a transient run while the variable flux coupled condition is entered as a boundary condition on the surface of 3 d mesh during the transient run it needs to match the initial state of rainfall data wash123d is designed as when a boundary is flux type for the rainfall period complete adsorption of throughfall water is assumed yeh et al 2011 3 5 4 wash123d simulation and performance evaluation after setting the conceptual model parameters initial and boundary conditions the groundwater flow simulation was performed for a real time case scenario using rainfall and pumping data for the event from 8 01 2019 0 00 to 8 22 2019 23 00 first the simulations were performed without considering the pumping data and compared with observations and then the same time simulation was performed by incorporating pumping data together with rainfall according to kaohsiung city smart groundwater management project there are 126 registered pumping wells operated by paper industries chemical industries cpc corporation taiwan water corporation and kaohsiung irrigation association there is continuous groundwater pumping by these stakeholders for the industrial commercial household and irrigation water supply considering this major stress on the system the numerical simulation was performed for a real case scenario using pumping and rainfall data together for the assessment of pumping effect on the groundwater levels for the selected period a total of 63 pumping stations has available pumping record at 10 min interval in terms of the volumetric unit ton the pumping data was processed into the units of l3 t and incorporated into wash123d input file system as source term according to the locations as shown in fig 4 after setting the input files and simulations the results with pumping data were compared with observed groundwater levels how does one judge whether model results or a set of model parameters are adequate for supporting regulatory decision making the essence of the problem is whether the behavior of a model matches the behavior of the real system sufficiently for the regulatory context there exist two major challenges in transient groundwater modeling i e 1 how one can assess the goodness of fit of model and 2 how to improve the model fit bakker and schaars 2019 numerous statistical indices metrics are used for model performance evaluation based on model goodness of fit and whether a model meets conditions to draw statistical conclusions reasonable hydrological responses of simulated results to the observation could be an indicator of model credibility and performance the percentage of variance nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and coefficient of determination r2 and root mean squared error rmse are two most common goodness of fit metrics used for statistical evaluation of transient groundwater modeling bakker and schaars 2019 in this study six statistical criteria in terms of the mean absolute error mae eq 6 root mean square error rmse eq 7 percent bias pbias eq 8 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse eq 9 kling gupta efficiency kge eq 10 and coefficient of determination r2 eq 11 are used as error measures for determining

these statistical criteria were selected because they provide a finer comparison between models and limit the bias of models against acute events bennett et al 2013 mae and rmse express average model

results and discussion 4 1 analysis of groundwater level response to rainfall for the analysis of water level fluctuation the observations wells were categorized into four clusters as shown in fig 5 based on topography location of nearby rainfall station and groundwater level patterns c 1 only has xinwei well located upstream high elevation near river floodplain the water level in xinwei well cluster showed rapid response to rainfall events with maximum fluctuation or variation of 1 9 m c 2 consists of meinong jiyang and jiyang gz observation wells in a relatively lower elevation than cluster 1 these wells show a smooth and seasonal change between recharge and recession period with a variation of 4 75 7 0 m the variations in groundwater levels become smoother in the intermediate elevation cluster named as c 3 consist of qishan tuku zhongzhou and ligang observation wells the average annual variation in groundwater level varies between 1 95 and 3 6 m groundwater levels in low elevation cluster c 4 are remarkably stable throughout the year with annual variation of 1 45 3 75 m c 4 consist of the downside remaining five wells xipu dashu jiuqu chaoliao and zhaoming the distinctive patterns of groundwater level hydrographs in the four well clusters at subjected study area underlie different hydrogeological regimes influencing the groundwater flow and storage in this way the study site groundwater hydrographs can be described as flashy response to rainfall c 1 smooth response to rainfall c 2 and c 3 no apparent response to rainfall c 4 but with seasonal variations throughout the year with recharge and recession phenomena within average daily timeframe overall the groundwater hydrographs analysis climaxes that the processes controlling the response to rainfall are different in the different geological formations rainfall may be a primary affecting factor of groundwater recharge in study area and to clarify this statement the analysis of groundwater level response to rainfall for each well station was performed by investigating the groundwater level fluctuation relationship with associated rainfall as shown in fig 6 it shows simply available groundwater level and rainfall data are known as groundwater hydrograph that was used for the analysis of water table response associated with rainfall fig 6 a d g shows how water table responses are associated with individual rainfall fig 6a at qishan and fig 6g at zhaoming locations indicate that water level is still rising from previous event so the lag time delay time in a response is counted with the time difference in the peak of rainfall event and associated peak water level moreover it is difficult to separate the response of one event from the other therefore all the previous events combine as clusters and develop a regression relationship to find out the associated rainfall response it was also observed that 15 20 mm isolated rainfall events were unable to show any response in water level change fig 6d at xipu site showing water table response for an isolated event is the rise from the level at the time of rainfall onset and the time lag for water level response is about 1 day fig 7 demonstrates the relationship between rainfall and associated water table response for selected sites the regression analysis technique was employed with time series data of rainfall and groundwater level to investigate relationships between groundwater level fluctuation and effective rainfall during each intensive rainfall event it shows water table response vs rainfall that provides each site information such as response threshold response ratio etc regression plots illustrate the linear relationship between rainfall per event and resultant water table response at each site all sites showed strong linear relationships between rainfall and groundwater level fluctuation i e r2 ranging from 0 83 to 0 96 the slope of the best fitting line represents the average period of record water response per unit rainfall event the obtained high correlations imply that the study area has a better groundwater level response to rainfall the scattering of data around linear line may result from combinations of the factors antecedent soil moisture rainfall distribution associated with local topography et water table height etc that influence the system healy and scanlon 2010 the regression analysis results of all selected observation wells and related information are listed in table 2 including number of events the regression model between response r and rainfall per event p r2 value nearest station rainfall range to each well station response ratio response threshold groundwater level fluctuation interval mean lag time for each well station the rainfall threshold indicated the first rainfall amount per event produces no water table response these response threshold values represent interception loss evapotranspiration loss or loss to unsaturated zone in this way these values should be positive while the negative response threshold value is not meaningful and presumably reflects changes in the trend of the best fitting line driven by other factors table 2 shows that all observation wells reflect nonnegative rainfall threshold except zhongzhou and dashu the negative threshold values may be some unknown local conditions the best fitting rainfall response threshold range from 1 4 mm to 57 8 mm per event at other sites the largest rainfall thresholds may be due to steep slope topography which facilitates quick runoff or overland flow or it might be due to deep water table that facilitates more vadose zone rainfall retention or retention losses due to undulating topography according to our understanding the available data is from shallow aquifer 13 57 m in depth so the concept of deepwater table may not influence more here one most possible explanation for higher threshold is the retention of rainfall in uppermost layer of vadose zone because it consists of finer sediment particles of clay mud and silt which provides permeability variations the other explanation is the rainfall loss in the form of runoff because the study area have steep topography and the rainfall runoff response time is very low that creating the situation of quick runoff and more loss of rainfall the meinong and jiuqu sites have less rainfall threshold due to semi confined to confined aquifer while the other sites tuku ligang and chaoliao are situated in alluvium aquifer that have good permeability we also find variability from site to site in the slopes response ratio and water level fluctuation range of the best fitting linear relationship between response and rainfall the time lag between rainfall input and groundwater level rise response for most of observation well was about 1 day suggesting some preferential flow occurring while sites meinong zhongzhou jiuqu zhaoming showed negative response lag time indicating that rainfall does not have a direct influence on fluctuation of groundwater level one possible explanation for negative lag time might be the presence of aquifer situation i e confined to semi confined at these sites 4 2 master recession curve analysis mrc analysis is the key to understanding the groundwater flow mechanism i e can be used to estimate hydrogeological parameters hydraulic conductivity the adopted methodology explained in this study support this statement groundwater hydrographs of each site in dry period were selected for each site mrc construction in this way the recession behavior became relatively more stable because it depends on rainfall antecedent moisture content and saturated aquifer thickness according to available data of rainfall and its variations in the study area the period from november to april is relatively dry the mrc was built by selecting several individual recession curve segments see fig 8 as an example of qishan site generally it is a common practice to represent recession curves on semi log plot by putting groundwater level gwl on logarithmic ordinate vs time t on normal abscissa to get the linear relationship the slope of straight line represents recession constant with unit per day fig 9 shows that mrc can be fitted well by two segments i e fast recession segment and slow recession segment of ln gwl vs t lines as an example of qishan site the quality of fitting was assessed based on correlation coefficient r2 it was observed that the correlation between mrc and fitted curve for slow recession segment was relatively high 0 96 r2 0 99 than early fast recession segment 0 73 r2 0 97 but overall showing good quality of fit it was also observed that some sites tuku zhongzhou ligang xipu and dashu in fig a appendix 1 showed underestimation of only a few initial gwls in fast recession segment of mrc fitting after linear fitting line analysis of ln gwl vs t of both segments the slope of straight line was used to calculate the recession coefficient of fast and slow recession segments as given in table 3 it was analyzed that some sites meining jiyang jiyang gz jiuqu zhaoming only showed one recession segment as a straight line and we called it here average recession segment fig a this happens because the obtained mrcs of this site provided straight line on normal plot of gwl vs t the calculated recession constants of 13 sites are shown in table 3 the average recession constant for fast recession period is Œ± 1 0 005 day 1 much larger than Œ± 2 0 00077 day 1 the slow recession period the finding based on comparison of recession constant indicates that Œ± 1 represent high permeability aquifer while Œ± 2 represents relatively low permeability aquifer it was also noticed that the first recession period lasts around 15 30 days for most of the sites except qishan and ligang sites 4 3 estimation of hydraulic parameters the hydraulic parameters presented in eq 3 i e k s y Œ± b d represents hydraulic conductivity specific yield recession constant aquifer half width and saturated thickness of aquifer respectively are listed in table 3 the s y of each site was estimated via the inverse of slope of straight line obtained with regression relationship between water table response vs rainfall per event the obtained values were compared with observed values and from morris and johnson 1967 after comparison the reasonable value of s y was used to estimate hydraulic conductivity of each site using eq 3 there are two values of hydraulic conductivity of some sites because the mrc has two segments fast and slow recessions so the Œ± 1 and Œ± 2 of related sites were calculated as explained in master recession curve analysis and later used to estimate hydraulic conductivity the values of b were calculated with the help of dem data in gis environment total 13 basins of study area were delineated and then the area of each basin a and length of longest flow path l was calculated the relation b a 2 l was used to estimate half width of aquifer of each basin as shown in table 3 the saturated thickness of aquifer d was adopted from previous research study conducted by hussain et al 2021c it was analyzed that the thickness of aquifer lies under shallow layer in alluvium formation moreover according to location of observation wells in fig 1a all wells are installed in alluvium formation so the estimated hydraulic parameters only represent alluvium formation shallow aquifer values after calculation of all unknowns in eq 3 the hydraulic conductivity of each basin in alluvium formation was estimated and compared with field observations table 3 the estimated hydraulic conductivity of fast recession period k 1 varying from 1 5 10 3 m s 1 for zhongzhou basin to 6 0 10 4 m s 1 for tuku basin the estimated hydraulic conductivity of slow recession period k 2 varying from 1 2 10 4 m s 1 for chaoliao basin to 7 26 10 5 m s 1 for tuku basin the estimated values indicated that the slow recession period has average k value in the order of 10 5 m s 1 while fast recession period has 10 4 m s 1 the comparison of average estimated k 1 and k 2 hydraulic conductivity with observed one at each site indicated that the estimated values are reasonable and can be used further for groundwater flow modeling using numerical models for example at meinong site in alluvium aquifer the estimated k e 3 07 10 4 m s 1 while k o observed 4 0 10 4 m s 1 similarly at qishan site k e 1 57 10 4 and k o 5 80 10 4 m s 1 but at zhaoming site there is underestimation i e k e 5 3 10 4 and k o 1 79 10 6 m s 1 4 4 groundwater recharge estimation recharge rate during rainy season may to october per year from 2001 to 2019 at each site was calculated using eq 4 the same s y values of each site were adopted here table 3 calculated recharge substantially varies in magnitude from 1472 mm year 1 43 of mean annual rainfall on average at xinwei site to 244 mm year 1 12 of mean annual rainfall at zhaoming site from highland basin to lowland basins as shown in table 4 the variations in estimated recharge using wtf method indicated that it could be influenced by differences in geology elevation land surface slope etc lee et al 2006 according to the geological formations of study area most of the observations wells lies in alluvium aquifer such as meinong jiyang jiyang gz tuku and showed maximum recharge rate i e 34 52 of seasonal annual rainfall the slightly lower average recharge rates of 406 812 mm year 1 were obtained for qishan zhongzhou and ligang sites which represent 20 31 of the annual rainfall while dashu jiuqu chaoliao and zhaoming sites represent 12 31 the slightly lower recharge rates for these sites compared to high recharge rate sites suggest that a small portion of rain infiltrate in the subsoil may travel down gradient via lateral flow within the layer which is consistent with general hillslope recharge mechanisms salve et al 2012 the recharge rates estimated in this study using the wtf method may contain uncertainty because the specific yield values were estimated not obtained from the reliable field methods in addition the recharge rates are estimated in shallow aquifer in shallow depths aquifer the impact of the capillary pressure on specific yield estimate is dependent on the heights of the capillary fringe in subsoil and transition zones for the extreme cases where the depth to water table is less than the height of the capillary pressure no water is released when water levels change healy and scanlon 2010 to quantify the uncertainty of the recharge estimates field studies with sophisticated field instrumentations are required to estimate specific yield for different geological units which is beyond the scope of this study in addition it is important to recognize that the recharge rates estimated for the shallow layers of subsoil and transition zones do not necessarily represent those in the deeper bedrock units 4 5 groundwater level modeling using wash123d numerical model in the last 2 d 3 d coupled finite element wash123d model is constructed in gms environment and simulated in transient condition with the help of estimated parameters the prior estimated hydraulic conductivity using water table response to rainfall relationship only provides information in alluvium formation and these values were used to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of other formations such as pleistocene pliocene to miocene as an initial guess due to non availability of observation wells in these formations the hydraulic conductivity values were comparatively supposed to use the hypothesis of alluvium to non alluvium formation i e the alluvium formation has good permeability than non alluvium formations the k values of linkou and tashe formations belong to pleistocene were assumed by one order and ¬Ω order reduction in magnitude from alluvium holocene formation respectively similarly for pliocene to miocene we reduce the k values up to 2 2 ¬Ω order magnitude from holocene as shown in table 5 after setting the model and steady state simulation the following transient simulation results for a real time case scenario using rainfall and pumping data for the event from 8 01 2019 0 00 to 8 22 2019 23 00 were obtained figs 10 and 11 first the simulation was performed without considering the pumping data and compared with observations the overestimation of simulated groundwater levels indicated that the natural forcing ensures enough recharge but there are pumping wells operated by different stakeholders the selected event has three continuous rainfall spells starting from 8 12 2019 0 00 to 8 18 2019 23 00 that probably provide enough rainfall recharge to compensate for the pumping effects the rising and recessing patterns of simulated groundwater levels before and after rainfall is similar to the observed record figs 10 and 11 indicate that the simulated results are fairly consistent with the observations although the simulation results are slightly overestimated may be due to no consideration of pumping data the aquifer response to the recharge discharge phenomenon is obvious through the simulation results and observed groundwater levels the rising limb of hydrographs indicating the recharging of aquifers and the groundwater level response to heavy rainfall indicating the time lag was about 1 day for the observation wells in this area the model performance evaluation and credibility were assessed through six statistical measures and the calculated values are shown in table 6 overall model performance is better based on the moriasi et al 2015 criteria the mae rmse and pbias values indicate the overestimation of simulations the nse kge and r2 values were found greater than 0 79 and mae rmse 0 25 m indicating satisfactory model performance without pumping data simulation overall the proposed simulation method and parameters are considered acceptable for further simulation using pumping data considering pumping as major stress on the system the numerical simulation was performed for a real case scenario using pumping and rainfall data together for the assessment of pumping effect on the groundwater levels at qishan and zhongzhou locations 13 pumping wells are under seventh branch taiwan water corporation for commercial and household water supply there is continuous pumping as can be seen from fig 10 the average total pumping rate is 1 303 m3 s of 13 pumping wells that drop the average groundwater level approximately 0 10 0 50 m in qishan 2 and zhongzhou 2 observation wells moreover the pumping record regularizes the groundwater levels according to the observations that indicated the dynamics of recharge and discharge phenomena in the aquifer similarly the xipu 2 observation well site has 11 pumping wells under formosa plastics corporation continuously pumping water at an average total rate of 0 412 m3 s for their demand according to the pumping record of the selected time as shown in fig 11 the continuous pumping rate drops the groundwater level 0 10 0 25 m on averagely of xipu 2 observation well from the results it is obvious that the continuous pumping decreases the groundwater level but due to available recharge from rainfall the drop in levels is not abrupt and the aquifer system showed the continuum process but for the long term subjectivity of sustained groundwater pumping and sustainability of aquifer the model simulations should be performed for long recession period generally speaking the illegal unregulated pumping in this area is one of the key issues that must be addressed through numerical simulation in advance studies in addition the pumping is mostly done in aquifer 2 a similar pattern comparison with observed water levels data indicated the reasonable hydrological response of groundwater levels to rainfall and pumping data the nse kge and r2 values 0 96 showed that the results with pumping data are very good the other values of statistical indicators mae 0 010 0 036 m rmse 0 014 0 052 m and pbias 0 01 to 0 10 indicating that the simulated results are also very slightly overestimated during real time case scenarios overall the simulation results with and without pumping data are relatively comparable with observations and there is a reasonable hydrological response of groundwater levels to rainfall and pumping data 5 conclusions in this study long term daily observed records of 16 rainfall stations and 13 groundwater level stations in sub regional area of kaohsiung city taiwan were used to evaluate the groundwater level response to rainfall and determine the recharge potential for shallow aquifer a good linear correlation relationship was found between groundwater level responses to associated rainfall we show a simple approach to estimate specific yield s y and hydraulic conductivity k from water table rise and drop during wet season may to october and dry season november to april respectively s y was estimated from the inverse of the slope of relationship between water level response to associated rainfall while the k was estimated with the relationship between recession constant Œ± aquifer half width b effective aquifer thickness d master recession curve mrc analysis using matching strip method was used to determine Œ± of fast flow recession period and slow flow recession period the fast and slow recession segments of mrc represent higher and lower permeability aquifer respectively the other parameters b and d were estimated using dem data in gis environment and lithology data respectively it was estimated that the k values of fast recession were one order larger than slow recession segment the proposed method indirectly determine the hydraulic parameters s y k with simply two data set i e groundwater level and rainfall recharge rate was estimated from groundwater level fluctuations wtf method and employs values of specific yield derived from proposed method in this study results showed the annual recharge rates of 244 1472 mm year 1 which represent 12 43 of rainfall in the study area the estimated k order of 10 4 10 5 m s 1 and s y 0 20 0 51 were used as prior values for groundwater numerical modeling wash123d was selected as an appropriate protocol for the simulation of 2 d surface and 3 d groundwater interactions the model simulations were performed with and without consideration of pumping data the performance of model results was assessed through six statistical indicators and their values were found close to the highest agreement indicating the reasonable hydrological response of groundwater levels to rainfall and pumping data overall the simulation results are relatively comparable with observations indicating that wash123d is an appropriate protocol to investigate the surface subsurface interaction in the selected study region and should be a credible approach for future research work and management of groundwater resources the real time case scenario simulation using pumping and rainfall data indicated the dynamics of recharge and discharge phenomena in the aquifer and the aquifer system showed the continuum process but for the long term subjectivity of sustained groundwater pumping and sustainability of aquifer wash123d simulations should be performed for long period for

8075,study region four districts meinong qishan dashu and daliao of kaohsiung city southern taiwan study focus the understanding of aquifer recharge in terms of water table response to rainfall is of critical importance to groundwater systems management and various endeavors have been made to estimate the amount of recharge using rainfall data the purpose of this study is to evaluate the groundwater level response to rainfall and determine the recharge potential for shallow aquifers we showed a simple approach to estimate specific yield s y and hydraulic conductivity k as functions of rainfall and water level data new hydrological insights for the region correlation method is applied to investigate groundwater level response to associated rainfall and it was found that the rise in water table linearly depends on the rainfall amount per event results show the annual recharge rates of 244 1472 mm year 1 which represent 12 43 of rainfall in the study area the estimated k order of 10 4 to 10 5 m s 1 and s y 0 20 0 51 were used as prior values to setup groundwater numerical modeling using wash123d the real time case scenario simulation using pumping and rainfall data indicated the reasonable hydrological response of groundwater levels to rainfall the long term simulations should be performed with wash123d to deal with the subjectivity of sustained groundwater pumping and sustainability of aquifers for better groundwater resource planning and management graphical abstract ga1 keywords water table fluctuation recession analysis specific yield hydraulic conductivity groundwater modeling wash123d 1 introduction long term groundwater level measurements and monitoring from observation wells provide principal information about aquifer behavior such as recharge discharge and storage phenomena under hydrological stresses alley and taylor 2001 cuthbert 2014 neto et al 2016 wu et al 2021 the systematic groundwater level measurements are the source of essential data that is required for the evaluation of changes in groundwater resources over time groundwater numerical modeling and forecasting and to design implement and monitor the effectiveness of groundwater management and protection programs taylor and alley 2001 there is a dynamic balance between groundwater recharge storage and discharge aquifer recharge for a rainfall event can be estimated from water table rise hsu and li 2020 kotchoni et al 2019 the water table rise in response to rainfall is a complex phenomenon because it is a function of many factors such as hydraulic conductivity k specific yield s y groundwater level gwl lateral groundwater flow antecedent moisture conditions land cover evapotranspiration et and rainfall intensity and volume rainfall data is an important factor in recharge estimation shi et al 2015 and has been identified as the primary factor affecting groundwater level crosbie et al 2005 park and parker 2008 gaalen et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 commonly there is assumption related to linear relationship between water table responses to rainfall in unconfined aquifers gaalen et al 2013 wu et al 1996 however this assumption may miss much of the variability in the system driven by the terrain heterogeneity and unsaturated zone fluxes healy and scanlon 2010 many literature studies described the relationship between water table response to rainfall using empirical and theoretical frameworks these methods were suitable mainly for shallow groundwater where there is a close correspondence between individual rainfall events and water table fluctuations depending on the system rainfall recharge relationships have been defined using linear or nonlinear relationships wu et al 1996 estimated groundwater recharge by developing linear regression model between water table response and associated rainfall recharge is estimated from observed groundwater level fluctuations and there is a linear relationship between rainfall and groundwater fluctuations e g kotchoni et al 2019 rama et al 2018 cai and ofterdinger 2016 jassas and merkel 2014 obuobie et al 2012 sibanda et al 2009 jan et al 2007 restrepo et al 2006 tan et al 2007 healy and cook 2002 nonlinear behavior has been also explored in rainfall recharge evaluations for example tan et al 2006 developed nonlinear regression model between rainfall recharge relationship park and parker 2008 theoretically explained the rise of water level in shallow aquifers as recharge by a physically based water table fluctuation model in the application of this model the recharge rate was dominantly influenced by the nonlinearity of unsaturated water content and permeability park 2012 gaalen et al 2013 assessed the nonlinear behavior by investigating the water table response to rainfall as a function of antecedent water level and rainfall event depth other scientists also demonstrated a nonlinear relationship between rainfall and recharge such as taylor et al 2013 and cobb et al 2017 cobb and harvey 2019 estimated hydraulic parameters k s y using rising and recession curves of water table by interpreting nonlinear function of both parameters with respect to groundwater level groundwater hydrographs generally represent the changes in water levels over time and the analysis can yield potentially hydraulic properties of aquifer such as specific yield recession constant and hydraulic conductivity park et al 2011 cuthbert 2014 crosbie et al 2019 however not all water level changes are caused by rainfall to become recharge while other factors as explained above in the first paragraph need to be minimized or removed from the water level signal crosbie et al 2005 in the literature studies the scientists adopted different approaches to minimize these factors such as in event base water balance approach for sy estimation the runoff et and change in soil moisture were assumed negligible to become recharge equal to the precipitation delin et al

flow to the aquifer boundaries air entrapment moisture content of the unsaturated zone and noise from pressure transducers nimmo et al 2015 cai and ofterdinger 2016 rama et al 2018 crosbie et al 2019 kotchoni et al 2019 in regression approach armstrong and narayan 1998 relationship is developed with a series of event calculations that fits a line through the rise in water table and event rainfall where the intercept is the threshold rainfall before recharge begins and the inverse of the slope is the sy gaalen et al 2013 rama et al 2018 cobb and harvey 2019 this threshold rainfall is lumped as initial water loss i e interception runoff et and soil moisture storage and needs to be overcome by subtracting from rainfall before recharge will begin rama et al 2018 crosbie et al 2019 for effective groundwater resource management during wet and dry season in a basin information related to hydraulic property distributions which controls water movement and its distributions in the basin is essential with this information the recharge rate can be delineated with water table fluctuation wtf method or groundwater numerical models for water resources management through estimation prediction and scenario analysis of surface water and groundwater systems the prior estimation of hydraulic parameters k s y is required for this purpose while these parameters cab be calibrated while fitting a simulated gwl to observed gwl park 2012 wtf method has been undertaken since the 1920s crosbie et al 2019 and is one of the widely used methods to quantify rainfall recharge rama et al 2018 masetti et al 2016 this method is applied for shallow unconfined aquifers in event basis approach delin et al 2007 for accurate quantification of recharge the time should be event based s y value should be appropriate and other influencing factors on groundwater fluctuations not related to recharging must be isolated healy and scanlon 2010 acharya et al 2012 neto et al 2016 the sy is uncertain and appropriate estimation is difficult the overestimation of sy leads to overestimation of recharge therefore sy should be treated as conceptual parameter that could be calibrated crosbie et al 2019 for example with known recharge from observed groundwater level the prior sy can be estimated to calculate the unknown recharge using wtf method this approach is more valid on event basis assuming that the time period is short enough that runoff and et can be ignored leaving recharge equal to precipitation seraphin et al 2018 fan et al 2014 delin et al 2007 this method can lead to an overestimation of sy crosbie et al 2019 another is the regression method to estimate sy by developing the relationship between water table rises in response to series of event rainfall armstrong and narayan 1998 cobb and harvey 2019 the inverse of the slope of the fitting line gives the value of s y rama et al 2018 gaalen et al 2013 and the intercept is the threshold rainfall considered as initial water loss as the sum of interception runoff et and change in soil moisture storage this threshold rainfall is subtracted from series of event rainfall and then prior estimation of sy is done some literature studies adopted inverse modeling of water table with temporal varying sy to calculate recharge time series park and parker 2008 park 2012 jeong and park 2017 sy can also be estimated based on falling recession of groundwater hydrograph due to pumping for irrigation over the dry season mar√©chal et al 2006 chinnasamy et al 2018 the recession part of groundwater hydrograph in the absence of recharge generally takes exponential form due to fast and slow recession periods the rate of recession recession constant can be used to calculate aquifer properties i e transmissivity using rorabaugh 1964 equation the recession analysis of groundwater hydrograph using master recession curve mrc is a viable tool to represent the recession rate i e the recession hydrograph slope over time nimmo and perkins 2018 the matching strip method is one of the most prominent method for the mrc determination carlotto and chaffe 2019 the prior estimated hydraulic parameters such as hydraulic conductivity k can be calibrated in physics based hydrological models for modeling groundwater system of regional area distributed integrated hydrological models coupling surface with groundwater processes are considered optimal tools for groundwater resources management coupled surface subsurface models include e g wash123d yeh et al 1998 inhm vanderkwaak and loague 2001 modhms panday and huyakorn 2004 mike she graham and butts 2005 parflow surface flow kollet and maxwell 2006 and pihm qu and duffy 2007 gsflow markstrom et al 2008 hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2010 cathy camporese et al 2010 paws shen and phanikumar 2010 tribs ofm kim et al 2012 and flush warsta et al 2013 these advanced generation models tend to be data intensive and their reliability is largely constrained by the availability and quality of input data among these models wash123d was selected in this study because of its availability and applications in many river basins of taiwan for groundwater assessment and flood simulation wash123d is an integrated multimedia multiprocess physics based watershed model suitable for various spatio temporal scales yeh et al 2011 moreover it is one of the most appropriate protocol to simulate surface water groundwater interactions based on full st venant equations 1 d 2 d and 3 d richards equation shih et al 2019 has used wash123d to assess groundwater flow and pumping effect and huang and shih 2020 applied this model to simulate seasonal groundwater levels in the area of southern taiwan the obtained results were stable because simulated groundwater level corresponds with observed one very well that indicating the satisfactory performance of wahs123d in selected study area of taiwan the performance of the model was also assessed in flood inundation forecasting for disaster reduction in taiwan river basins for example flood estimation and forecasting during typhoons in langyang creek basin shih and yeh 2011 shih et al 2012a 2014 hsiao et al 2013 coastal inundation in eastern and mid western coast shih et al 2012b hsu et al 2017 the effect of land use and climate change on flow regimes in fengshan creek basin wu and shih 2018 hussain et al 2021a conducted a study in fengshan creek basin northern taiwan for 1 h ahead flood level forecasting using wash123d and support vector machine svm model more detail about wash123d modeling capacity capabilities and literature publications that assessed surface flow groundwater flow sediment and salinity transport are available in hussain 2021 according to our understanding there is a need for groundwater use regulations in the area of southern taiwan during dry seasons because of less available surface water supply there is a common practice of over pumping and excess use of groundwater for the fulfilment of water demand this is inducing serious regional land subsidence and seawater intrusion along with derived social and economic issues hsu et al 2015 tran and wang 2020 therefore effective management of groundwater resources is needed to not only consider and treat the groundwater as a whole but also take into account the interactions between surface and groundwater at varied spatio temporal scale the simulation of surface and groundwater coupled flows in the watershed system using physics based groundwater models can provide a reference to the exploration operations and regulations of groundwater resources in decision making also deprived of knowing the pumping locations and history the numerical simulations look to be the only way to establish a link between the drops in groundwater levels with unregulated illegal pumping khan et al 2017 shih et al 2019 therefore the present paper aims to study the water table response to rainfall and simulate groundwater level using wash123d model the study is based on the field observation data of observation well stations and rain gauge stations in sub regional area of kaohsiung city taiwan we simply used long term groundwater level and rainfall data and developed the water table response to rainfall relationship to estimate the specific yield the matching strip method was used to develop mrc at each site on a semi logarithmic plot the slope of the line indicates recession constant and it was used to estimate hydraulic conductivity these prior estimated parameters were used to set up surface water groundwater numerical model we selected wash123d model as the most appropriate protocol to simulate coupled 2 d overland 3 d groundwater flow system the model was used for the simulation of real time case scenarios using pumping and rainfall data to understand the pumping effects on groundwater levels this study is unique in terms of its application and methodology because we introduce a simple approach to estimate hydraulic parameters of a shallow aquifer and then these parameters were tested to calculate the recharge potential of the study aquifer and groundwater flow simulation using real time case scenario data 2 study area description this study is conducted in a sub regional area of kaohsiung city consisting of four districts namely meinong qishan dashu and daliao as shown in fig 1a which covers approximately 594 km2 the topography gradually varied from sea level to 951 m from the south coast to north central mountain range the average annual rainfall of the area is approximately 2500 mm and around 69 of that rainfall occurred in may to october months the outcropped formation is shown in fig 1b generally the formation is comprised of sedimentary rocks and their ages vary from the holocene and pleistocene quaternary to the pliocene and miocene neogene the youngest lithology is the holocene less than 11 700 years and it consists of deposits from the western foothills and the central range brought by the modern channel to lower elevations the holocene alluvium and the terrace deposits consist of gravel sand and mud the pleistocene formations between 11 700 and 2 58 million years include the linkou and liugui conglomerates and the tashe formation the linkou conglomerate consists mainly of clastic support while the liugui conglomerate consists of matrix support the tashe formation consists of thick mudstones with interbedded sandstone and conglomerates the pleistocene formations are weakly cemented and are usually not heavily jointed the hydraulic conductivity is slightly lower than that of the holocene sediments but generally higher than that of the neogene miocene to pliocene bedrocks the geological investigation indicated that all of the aquifers are connected an unconfined and three confined aquifers namely f1 layer 1 f2 f3 1 and f3 2 layer 4 were identified from shallow to 200 m depth fig 1c there are 13 observation wells and 13 basins inside the study area fig 1a meinong district geology formation is holocene alluvium and terrace and pleistocene liugui conglomerate and has meinong jiyang and jiyang gz observation wells qishan district has two observation wells qishan and zhongzhou in terrace formation dashu district has three observation wells xipu dashu jiuqu in alluvium formation near pleistocene linkou conglomerate daliao district has two wells chaoliao and zhaoming inside alluvium formation near pleistocene tashe formation the study area is unique in terms of groundwater problems because there is no official joint surface groundwater regulation and management for comprehensive groundwater use regulation and rules there is a need for a proper monitoring network to devise policy regarding water allocation and rights the preceding projects of water resources agency wra lack the accurate estimation of groundwater abstraction amount over the years 3 materials and methods 3 1 data acquisition and processing long term 2001 2019 monitoring data on daily basis from 17 rainfall stations and 13 groundwater level stations were collected from wra website https gweb wra gov tw hydroinfo id index the example of available groundwater level and rainfall data is shown in fig 6 at qishan xipu and zhaoming locations after collection of required data the processing has been done to identify rainfall event size and duration water table response in terms of rising in water level due to that event and lag time delay between maximum rainfall and the resulting maximum rise in water level the dataset required for 2 d 3 d transient numerical simulation with wash123d include hydrogeological pumping and groundwater levels meteorological rainfall and physiographic digital elevation model land use cover soil type and outcrop formation databases the necessary input data was acquired from government agencies such as the physiographic data was collected from an open data source of ministry of interior and central geological survey cgs ministry of economic affairs taiwan 3 2 water table response to rainfall the relationship between rainfall events and the resulting water table level rise is defined here as recharge in terms of response to rainfall in the study area the occurrence of rainfall during rainy season may to october happens in cluster form i e there is a continuous rainfall for 7 10 days under different intensity due to tropical typhoons and low pressure gradient zones hussain et al 2021b therefore the event size consists of concentrated rainfall cluster a group of continuous rainfall events that together generate a peak in groundwater level the water table response associated with individual rainfall events was accounted for using the procedure of wu et al 1996 the water table response is the difference between water level rise to peak and before water level subsequently started to drop by identifying rainfall events and responses for each site the correlation using best fitting line approach was computed between associated rainfall and rise in water level as water table response the correlation coefficient r2 was used to evaluate the strength of this regression analysis the regression equation of each site obtained through this relationship rainfall per event vs water table response provides important aquifer parameters such as specific yield response threshold and response ratio best fit slope gaalen et al 2013 crosbie et al 2019 for the prior estimation of sy we adopted the regression procedure proposed by armstrong and narayan 1998 the rises of water table from series of rainfall events at borehole scale were calculated the plot of water table response vs associated rainfall per event was drawn for each site where the intercept is the threshold rainfall before recharge begins armstrong and narayan 1998 crosbie et al 2005 the response threshold represents the water loss which is the amount of rainfall that occurs before any water table response is seen and was calculated by finding x intercept of the best fitting line the positive value of x intercept represents all other water losses such as soil moisture variation canopy interception evapotranspiration and overland runoff flow in water balance approach the value below response threshold means no recharge reaches the groundwater a negative value for a response threshold is not meaningful and presumably reflects changes in the trend of the best fitting line driven by other factors gaalen et al 2013 after subtracting the threshold rainfall from series of events the sy was estimated by inverse of slope of line that fits through rise in water level and calculated rainfall other researchers also adopted a similar water balance approach to estimate sy such as disregarding other complexities the inverse of slope of response vs rainfall line is specific yield gaalen et al 2013 similarly rama et al 2018 used the regression best fit line and equation in rainfall and water table fluctuation plot to estimate specific yield by taking the inverse of the slope of the fitting line in graph cobb and harvey 2019 also estimated the specific yield by fitting the rising curve water level vs rainfall depth and taking the inverse of line slope our prior estimated sy values at borehole scale were compared with observed values and from morris and johnson 1967 other parameters such as mean lag time between peak rainfall and peak water table response water level fluctuation range and rainfall range minimum maximum and mean of time series were also computed for a more physical understanding of aquifer behavior at each site 3 3 recession analysis and hydraulic parameters the methodology adopted in this study for prior estimation of hydraulic conductivity k of shallow aquifer is based on groundwater recession analysis gis analysis and rorabaugh 1964 equation rorabaugh 1964 developed an equation that relates the slope of groundwater recession recession constant to the transmissivity and specific yield of the groundwater aquifer the derived equation was formulated for recession of groundwater level based on simple aquifer geometry and boundary conditions rorabaugh model can be adopted with certain assumptions 1 the aquifer is considered to be thick relative to change in water table caused by recharge 2 aquifer is isotropic and homogeneous 3 aquifer is underlain by impermeable layer rutledge 2006 the applicability of rorabaugh model was assessed according to fig 1 it was observed that alluvium formation aquifer f1 is up to 40 m thick and underlain by impermeable layer moreover the location of observation wells in same alluvium formation indicates homogenous aquifer with this knowledge the prior estimation of k in alluvium aquifer was done according to rorabaugh model as given in eq 1 1 t s y 0 933 b 2 ln h 1 h 2 t 2 t 1 where h 1 and h 2 are the groundwater levels at time t 1 and t 2 during the period of recession respectively t is the transmissivity s y is the specific yield and b is the aquifer half width which is the average distance from the stream to the hydrologic divide in eq 1 the slope of master recession curve mrc segment is recession constant Œ± ln h 1 h 2 t 2 t 1 so eq 1 can be rearranged as 2 t s y b 2 Œ± 1 071 to calculate the hydraulic conductivity of each site eq 2 was further rearranged by incorporating t kd where k is hydraulic conductivity and d is effective aquifer depth the following equation was obtained to estimate the hydraulic conductivity 3 k b 2 Œ± s y 1 071 d the values of s y was already estimated via slope of regression line between rise in groundwater level associated with rainfall event while the Œ± value was calculated from groundwater recession analysis in any aquifer the individual recession segments recorded at different times may have different slopes depending on the variability in storage evaporation loss and recharge rate posavec et al 2006 therefore it is necessary to compile all individual recessions into a single curve called master recession curve mrc that represents an average characterization of groundwater level matching strip method is a graphical method used here to construct the mrc of each site this method is based on exponential model that overlaps individual plotted recession segments by horizontal adjustment to form a single recession curve representative of long data series snyder 1939 for the recession analysis of groundwater at each site the long term daily groundwater level data was processed by separating it into two parts based on wet rainy and dry non rainy seasons and only the dry season november to april groundwater level data was used to construct mrcs in addition the groundwater levels corresponding to rainfall data points were eliminated the recession segments were selected by assuming a minimum length of 7 days with a rate of change between consecutive groundwater levels in this way we only have drops of curves that transformed more closely to the groundwater flow the drop down curves were sorted from the highest to lowest according to initial value of each drop down segment and moved together to obtain master curve the best trend line logarithmic or linear was fitted for the obtained master curve at each site based on highest r2 value according to the boussinesq model the mrc should be a straight line on a semi logarithmic plot and the slope of this straight line is represented as recession constant day 1 however in a long time series data it is not possible to get straight lines recession curves and the solution is to separate into several short straight line segments liu et al 2016 for mrcs during drought periods two straight line segments can be obtained by neglecting the recharge from reservoirs or open channels that have significant storage during rainy season fiorillo 2014 and chen et al 2012 interpreted these segments as fast high water table drainage rapid depletion from high permeability fractures and as low water table drainage slow depletion from low permeability fractures in this study the same methodology was adopted to separate the mrcs into two straight line segments i e rapid Œ± 1 and slow Œ± 2 depletions to calculate the recession constant values of both segments both recession values were estimated via slope of mrcs segments in semi logarithmic graph the values of other unknown parameters of eq 3 such as aquifer half width b a 2 l which is the average distance from the stream to the hydrologic divide this was estimated with the help of digital elevation model dem data in geographical information system gis environment in arcgis 10 2 using arc hydro tools thirteen sub basins were delineated based on dem data related to each site as shown in fig 1a the drainage area a and total stream length l of each basin were calculated to obtain the value of b the values of effective aquifer depth d of each site was taken from hussain et al 2021c published in hydrological sciences journal where they reasonably estimated d values using borehole lithology and dem data after getting all the parameters values of eq 3 the hydraulic conductivity of each site was estimated by indirect approach and was compared with field values obtained from central geological survey cgs 3 4 recharge calculation the full knowledge of observed groundwater level fluctuation can be used to calculate the recharge in unconfined aquifer kotchoni et al 2019 the water table fluctuation wtf method assumes that the rises of groundwater level in unconfined aquifer are controlled by the water recharge to drainage rate d t mathematically can be expressed as 4 r e s y h t d t 5 r e h i d t t i s y if t i p d 0 and h i d t t i 0 otherwise 0 according to eq 4 the groundwater recharge r e is estimated by the change in water table height h build up during after a rainfall event over time t times the specific yield s y healy and cook 2002 crosbie et al 2005 improved the wtf method as represented in eq 5 to account for the drainage effect using the rainfall and groundwater level time series data in eq 5 p d is daily accumulated rainfall and subscript i represents all intervals available in the dataset d t is estimated based on observed recessions in groundwater levels during no rain over multiple days it is the function of water table height and was determined by a linear fitting process of daily water level decline to its corresponding water table height s y values were estimated and compared with field values and representative values provided by morris and johnson 1967 the comparable value of s y was used to calculate the recharge per rainfall event of each site the information about geological materials was obtained from cgs website https hydro moeacgs gov tw map zh tw as shown in fig 1c according to morris and johnson 1967 the s y value for coarse gravel to fine gravel material ranges 0 21 0 28 while coarse sand to fine sand ranges 0 30 0 33 for silt clay and sandstone the value of s y is 0 20 0 06 and 0 21 respectively after comparing the s y values at each site the recharge rate was calculated using eq 5 in rainy intervals only and corrected by all drainage effects lumped in d t including moisture content of the unsaturated zone at daily time step and yearly recharge was calculated by summing daily recharge 3 5 groundwater numerical modeling after finding out the hydrogeological parameter k the groundwater numerical modeling with pumping scenario was performed using physically based wash123d watershed model for this purpose the model setting was done with 2 d 3 d transient simulations in wash123d version 2 0 while the pre processing such as necessary input geometry files site characterization model conceptualization mesh generation and post processing was performed in gms environment manning s roughness n and hydraulic conductivity k are two basic hydraulic parameters for 2 d overland flow and 3 d groundwater flow simulation respectively these parameters are estimated before the initiation of numerical simulation the model was set up and defined various hydrogeological units based on the outcropped formation therefore the prior estimation of hydraulic conductivity was performed as discussed in above section the overland surface roughness parameter n values are based on land use and land cover classification and determined with reference to previous studies conducted in taiwan shih and yeh 2011 shih et al 2019 the values of manning s roughness coefficient for 2 d overland flow used in this study are presented in table 1 3 5 1 hydrogeological analysis and conceptual model development before the construction of numerical groundwater model it is important to understand the hydrogeological framework for the proper conceptualization of the flow system according to the cgs report from website https hydro moeacgs gov tw map zh tw and geologist suggestions such as from professor jia jyun dong graduate institute of applied geology national central university the subsurface strata can be divided into aquifer system from top to bottom namely aquifer 1 f1 aquitard 1 t1 aquifer 2 f2 aquitard 2 t2 aquifer 3 1 f3 1 aquitard 3 t3 and aquifer 3 2 f3 2 as shown in fig 1c the meinong district outcrop formation the subsurface cross sectional view and a conceptual model fig 2a b an example for demonstration purposes the outcrop formation of meinong district consists of holocene alluvium and terrace deposition pleistocene luigui conglomerate early pliocene yanshui shale miocene changzhikeng layer and late miocene tangenshan sandstone according to the geologist and expert s opinions the holocene formations have higher hydraulic conductivity as compared to pleistocene and pliocene formations and it varies approximately one order reduction in magnitude from holocene to late miocene formations this provides relatively comparable information for the prior estimation of hydraulic conductivity in the study region the cross sectional view of sections aa and bb locations indicated the vertical distribution of formations and it is almost 300 m deep from surface elevation the core drilling data from cgs also indicated that the aquifer 1 f1 has almost 27 70 m depth while aquifer 2 f2 has up to 200 m depth at different locations in the study area the conceptual model describes the groundwater flow system numerically and identifies the hydrological and hydrogeological conditions and all important features and drivers of the groundwater system including sources sinks boundary conditions geophysical features that convey water or interrupt the flow recharge site stratigraphy material properties etc to simulate groundwater flow adequately in the region the detailed hydrogeological framework was simplified into a conceptual model that incorporates the important regional scale features of the groundwater system the conceptual model consists of four aquifers separated by three confining units total 14 vertical layers have been used to conceptualize the quasi 3d groundwater flow i e the horizontal flow occurs only within the aquifer layers and vertical flow occurs only between the aquifer layers the prior estimation of hydraulic conductivity using water table response to rainfall relationship mainly deals with aquifer 1 in holocene formation which comprised of different hydrogeological material characteristics such as coarse gravels a2 medium to fine gravels a1 coarse sand t medium to fine sand c and silt clay d1 while the mud layer fluvial deposits linkou conglomerate aquitards and other layers are expressed as independent units the hydraulic conductivity k in the lateral direction of other hydrogeological formation such as pleistocene pliocene to miocene as an initial guess was estimated from the information of alluvium formation due to non availability of observation wells in these formations the hydraulic conductivity values were comparatively supposed to use the hypothesis of alluvium to non alluvium formation i e the alluvium formation has good permeability than non alluvium formations the k values of linkou and tashe formations belong to pleistocene were assumed by one order and ¬Ω order reduction in magnitude from alluvium holocene formation respectively similarly for pliocene to miocene we reduce the k values up to 2 2 ¬Ω order magnitude from holocene these values were incorporated into model according to material defined in groundwater modeling system gms environment 3 5 2 mesh generation the conceptual model with all basic components that may affect groundwater flow is used to construct 3 d mesh or model grid for required simulations the mesh development process has been performed in gms aquaveo https www aquaveo com software gms groundwater modeling system introduction the 3 d unstructured finite element mesh was generated to begin with the development of 2 d triangular grids the predefined hydrogeological units land use data and the digital terrain model dtm was used for generating 2 d grids and mapping various input data to the grid nodes the simple 2 d generated mesh after corrections according to area outcrop formation was used for 3 d mesh generation as the topography hydrogeological unit s distribution is complex in the study area so the refinement of the 3 d mesh was also performed according to the complexity and known conditions for example the interface layer correction between aquifers and impermeable layers and in meinong district the stratum is syncline morphology and interbedding and distribution of different outcropped formations such is changchikeng layer tangenshan sandstone liugui conglomerate and terrace deposit is complex and corrected in 3 d mesh according to site similarly the qishan district mesh was refined according to different bedrock formations i e nanshilun sandstone kaitzuliao shale gutinkeng and wushan formations dashu district stratum dips roughly from northwest to southeast and its hydrogeological conditions include linkou conglomerate so the geometry dips eastward by about 10 15 degrees in 3 d mesh refinement with fine scale element size the 2 d overland mesh was discretized into 47 088 nodes and 46 580 elements while the 3 d groundwater model was divided into fourteen layers and geometry was discretized into 353 160 mesh nodes and 652 120 unstructured mesh elements the 3 d simulation modeling depth was approximately 440 m while the unstructured grid size range from 200 to 30 m fig 3 3 5 3 initial boundary conditions and input attributes of 2 d 3 d coverage various types of boundary conditions determined based on physical reasoning are essential to supplement the governing equations of wash123d the 2 d coverage mainly needs open surface boundary conditions and attributes such as specific depth specific stage and flux boundary in this study for 2 d coverage the time dependent water depth of zero as dirichlet boundary was applied so that no water was supposed to pass over the border boundary nodes while time dependent water stage of zero as tidal type dirichlet boundary was applied over the south along the coastline the rainfall is the only input force applied to 2 d coverage via thiessen polygon method in terms of rainfall rate meter per second the 3 d coverage needs the identification of border boundary nodes for initial enforced head attributes in this study the time dependent total head as dirichlet boundary prescribed head for 3 d simulation was adopted for that purpose idw inverse distance weighting method was used to interpolate the groundwater level data from observation wells and then set it as the constant head boundary the rainfall rate was used as a variable flux boundary for surface subsurface interaction the simulation was conducted with a finite element approach using 2 d depth average diffusive wave equation and 3 d richard s equation the governing equations are solved with semi lagrangian particle tracking approach and galerkin finite element methods to determine overland flow and variably saturated subsurface flow respectively for the selection of solver specification a point wise iterative matrix solver was used with nodal quadrature for the integration of an element side and an element for 2 d 3 d simulation number of 1000 linear iterations were allowed in the matrix solver with 10 3 m absolute error convergent criteria for steady state and transient simulation of 3 d flow while 50 iterations were allowed for 2 d overland flow simulation total 100 non linear iterations for 2 d 3 d simulation are allowed and computational time step sizes are 16 min for 3 d subsurface media and 1 5 min for 2 d overland regime only the principal diagonal k xx k yy and k zz hydraulic conductivity values were considered homogeneous hydraulic conductivity tensor while off diagonal terms k xy k xz and k yz are considered zero by assuming uniform material properties inside the layers and the relation between darcy velocity and the hydraulic gradient is referred to the principal axes the horizontal conductivities in x and y directions are considered the same k xx k yy while vertical conductivities were 10 of horizontal conductivities i e k zz 0 1k xx adopted from cheng et al 2006 and shih and yeh 2011 initial and boundary conditions must be identified for transient simulation the initial condition can be obtained from steady state simulation with constant boundary conditions yeh et al 2011 the steady state simulation must be based on field measurements in this study the same instructions were used for 2 d 3 d transient simulations the initial conditions were obtained by steady state simulation before truly beginning to run in transient mode for steady state simulation the 3 d starting conditions must match field measurement at starting condition in order to force that to happen we assign constant head boundary conditions to the 3 d border boundary nodes using idw interpolation technique this is called the initial enforced total head because it is only enforced in that steady state run after that run the boundary condition is ignored and the results are used as the initial condition for 3 d transient model the rainfall coverage is considered zero in steady state simulation while in 2d 3d coupled rainfall coverage is called variable flux couple that is similar to the initial enforced total head in a 2 d 3 d transient wash123d model the rainfall is only applied to the 2 d realm water only enters 3 d realm by infiltration so the rainfall is not applied to the 3 d mesh that is the reason we run the steady state initially to develop the starting conditions for a transient run while the variable flux coupled condition is entered as a boundary condition on the surface of 3 d mesh during the transient run it needs to match the initial state of rainfall data wash123d is designed as when a boundary is flux type for the rainfall period complete adsorption of throughfall water is assumed yeh et al 2011 3 5 4 wash123d simulation and performance evaluation after setting the conceptual model parameters initial and boundary conditions the groundwater flow simulation was performed for a real time case scenario using rainfall and pumping data for the event from 8 01 2019 0 00 to 8 22 2019 23 00 first the simulations were performed without considering the pumping data and compared with observations and then the same time simulation was performed by incorporating pumping data together with rainfall according to kaohsiung city smart groundwater management project there are 126 registered pumping wells operated by paper industries chemical industries cpc corporation taiwan water corporation and kaohsiung irrigation association there is continuous groundwater pumping by these stakeholders for the industrial commercial household and irrigation water supply considering this major stress on the system the numerical simulation was performed for a real case scenario using pumping and rainfall data together for the assessment of pumping effect on the groundwater levels for the selected period a total of 63 pumping stations has available pumping record at 10 min interval in terms of the volumetric unit ton the pumping data was processed into the units of l3 t and incorporated into wash123d input file system as source term according to the locations as shown in fig 4 after setting the input files and simulations the results with pumping data were compared with observed groundwater levels how does one judge whether model results or a set of model parameters are adequate for supporting regulatory decision making the essence of the problem is whether the behavior of a model matches the behavior of the real system sufficiently for the regulatory context there exist two major challenges in transient groundwater modeling i e 1 how one can assess the goodness of fit of model and 2 how to improve the model fit bakker and schaars 2019 numerous statistical indices metrics are used for model performance evaluation based on model goodness of fit and whether a model meets conditions to draw statistical conclusions reasonable hydrological responses of simulated results to the observation could be an indicator of model credibility and performance the percentage of variance nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and coefficient of determination r2 and root mean squared error rmse are two most common goodness of fit metrics used for statistical evaluation of transient groundwater modeling bakker and schaars 2019 in this study six statistical criteria in terms of the mean absolute error mae eq 6 root mean square

these statistical criteria were selected because they provide a finer comparison between models and limit the bias of models against acute events bennett et al 2013 mae and rmse express average model

results and discussion 4 1 analysis of groundwater level response to rainfall for the analysis of water level fluctuation the observations wells were categorized into four clusters as shown in fig 5 based on topography location of nearby rainfall station and groundwater level patterns c 1 only has xinwei well located upstream high elevation near river floodplain the water level in xinwei well cluster showed rapid response to rainfall events with maximum fluctuation or variation of 1 9 m c 2 consists of meinong jiyang and jiyang gz observation wells in a relatively lower elevation than cluster 1 these wells show a smooth and seasonal change between recharge and recession period with a variation of 4 75 7 0 m the variations in groundwater levels become smoother in the intermediate elevation cluster named as c 3 consist of qishan tuku zhongzhou and ligang observation wells the average annual variation in groundwater level varies between 1 95 and 3 6 m groundwater levels in low elevation cluster c 4 are remarkably stable throughout the year with annual variation of 1 45 3 75 m c 4 consist of the downside remaining five wells xipu dashu jiuqu chaoliao and zhaoming the distinctive patterns of groundwater level hydrographs in the four well clusters at subjected study area underlie different hydrogeological regimes influencing the groundwater flow and storage in this way the study site groundwater hydrographs can be described as flashy response to rainfall c 1 smooth response to rainfall c 2 and c 3 no apparent response to rainfall c 4 but with seasonal variations throughout the year with recharge and recession phenomena within average daily timeframe overall the groundwater hydrographs analysis climaxes that the processes controlling the response to rainfall are different in the different geological formations rainfall may be a primary affecting factor of groundwater recharge in study area and to clarify this statement the analysis of groundwater level response to rainfall for each well station was performed by investigating the groundwater level fluctuation relationship with associated rainfall as shown in fig 6 it shows simply available groundwater level and rainfall data are known as groundwater hydrograph that was used for the analysis of water table response associated with rainfall fig 6 a d g shows how water table responses are associated with individual rainfall fig 6a at qishan and fig 6g at zhaoming locations indicate that water level is still rising from previous event so the lag time delay time in a response is counted with the time difference in the peak of rainfall event and associated peak water level moreover it is difficult to separate the response of one event from the other therefore all the previous events combine as clusters and develop a regression relationship to find out the associated rainfall response it was also observed that 15 20 mm isolated rainfall events were unable to show any response in water level change fig 6d at xipu site showing water table response for an isolated event is the rise from the level at the time of rainfall onset and the time lag for water level response is about 1 day fig 7 demonstrates the relationship between rainfall and associated water table response for selected sites the regression analysis technique was employed with time series data of rainfall and groundwater level to investigate relationships between groundwater level fluctuation and effective rainfall during each intensive rainfall event it shows water table response vs rainfall that provides each site information such as response threshold response ratio etc regression plots illustrate the linear relationship between rainfall per event and resultant water table response at each site all sites showed strong linear relationships between rainfall and groundwater level fluctuation i e r2 ranging from 0 83 to 0 96 the slope of the best fitting line represents the average period of record water response per unit rainfall event the obtained high correlations imply that the study area has a better groundwater level response to rainfall the scattering of data around linear line may result from combinations of the factors antecedent soil moisture rainfall distribution associated with local topography et water table height etc that influence the system healy and scanlon 2010 the regression analysis results of all selected observation wells and related information are listed in table 2 including number of events the regression model between response r and rainfall per event p r2 value nearest station rainfall range to each well station response ratio response threshold groundwater level fluctuation interval mean lag time for each well station the rainfall threshold indicated the first rainfall amount per event produces no water table response these response threshold values represent interception loss evapotranspiration loss or loss to unsaturated zone in this way these values should be positive while the negative response threshold value is not meaningful and presumably reflects changes in the trend of the best fitting line driven by other factors table 2 shows that all observation wells reflect nonnegative rainfall threshold except zhongzhou and dashu the negative threshold values may be some unknown local conditions the best fitting rainfall response threshold range from 1 4 mm to 57 8 mm per event at other sites the largest rainfall thresholds may be due to steep slope topography which facilitates quick runoff or overland flow or it might be due to deep water table that facilitates more vadose zone rainfall retention or retention losses due to undulating topography according to our understanding the available data is from shallow aquifer 13 57 m in depth so the concept of deepwater table may not influence more here one most possible explanation for higher threshold is the retention of rainfall in uppermost layer of vadose zone because it consists of finer sediment particles of clay mud and silt which provides permeability variations the other explanation is the rainfall loss in the form of runoff because the study area have steep topography and the rainfall runoff response time is very low that creating the situation of quick runoff and more loss of rainfall the meinong and jiuqu sites have less rainfall threshold due to semi confined to confined aquifer while the other sites tuku ligang and chaoliao are situated in alluvium aquifer that have good permeability we also find variability from site to site in the slopes response ratio and water level fluctuation range of the best fitting linear relationship between response and rainfall the time lag between rainfall input and groundwater level rise response for most of observation well was about 1 day suggesting some preferential flow occurring while sites meinong zhongzhou jiuqu zhaoming showed negative response lag time indicating that rainfall does not have a direct influence on fluctuation of groundwater level one possible explanation for negative lag time might be the presence of aquifer situation i e confined to semi confined at these sites 4 2 master recession curve analysis mrc analysis is the key to understanding the groundwater flow mechanism i e can be used to estimate hydrogeological parameters hydraulic conductivity the adopted methodology explained in this study support this statement groundwater hydrographs of each site in dry period were selected for each site mrc construction in this way the recession behavior became relatively more stable because it depends on rainfall antecedent moisture content and saturated aquifer thickness according to available data of rainfall and its variations in the study area the period from november to april is relatively dry the mrc was built by selecting several individual recession curve segments see fig 8 as an example of qishan site generally it is a common practice to represent recession curves on semi log plot by putting groundwater level gwl on logarithmic ordinate vs time t on normal abscissa to get the linear relationship the slope of straight line represents recession constant with unit per day fig 9 shows that mrc can be fitted well by two segments i e fast recession segment and slow recession segment of ln gwl vs t lines as an example of qishan site the quality of fitting was assessed based on correlation coefficient r2 it was observed that the correlation between mrc and fitted curve for slow recession segment was relatively high 0 96 r2 0 99 than early fast recession segment 0 73 r2 0 97 but overall showing good quality of fit it was also observed that some sites tuku zhongzhou ligang xipu and dashu in fig a appendix 1 showed underestimation of only a few initial gwls in fast recession segment of mrc fitting after linear fitting line analysis of ln gwl vs t of both segments the slope of straight line was used to calculate the recession coefficient of fast and slow recession segments as given in table 3 it was analyzed that some sites meining jiyang jiyang gz jiuqu zhaoming only showed one recession segment as a straight line and we called it here average recession segment fig a this happens because the obtained mrcs of this site provided straight line on normal plot of gwl vs t the calculated recession constants of 13 sites are shown in table 3 the average recession constant for fast recession period is Œ± 1 0 005 day 1 much larger than Œ± 2 0 00077 day 1 the slow recession period the finding based on comparison of recession constant indicates that Œ± 1 represent high permeability aquifer while Œ± 2 represents relatively low permeability aquifer it was also noticed that the first recession period lasts around 15 30 days for most of the sites except qishan and ligang sites 4 3 estimation of hydraulic parameters the hydraulic parameters presented in eq 3 i e k s y Œ± b d represents hydraulic conductivity specific yield recession constant aquifer half width and saturated thickness of aquifer respectively are listed in table 3 the s y of each site was estimated via the inverse of slope of straight line obtained with regression relationship between water table response vs rainfall per event the obtained values were compared with observed values and from morris and johnson 1967 after comparison the reasonable value of s y was used to estimate hydraulic conductivity of each site using eq 3 there are two values of hydraulic conductivity of some sites because the mrc has two segments fast and slow recessions so the Œ± 1 and Œ± 2 of related sites were calculated as explained in master recession curve analysis and later used to estimate hydraulic conductivity the values of b were calculated with the help of dem data in gis environment total 13 basins of study area were delineated and then the area of each basin a and length of longest flow path l was calculated the relation b a 2 l was used to estimate half width of aquifer of each basin as shown in table 3 the saturated thickness of aquifer d was adopted from previous research study conducted by hussain et al 2021c it was analyzed that the thickness of aquifer lies under shallow layer in alluvium formation moreover according to location of observation wells in fig 1a all wells are installed in alluvium formation so the estimated hydraulic parameters only represent alluvium formation shallow aquifer values after calculation of all unknowns in eq 3 the hydraulic conductivity of each basin in alluvium formation was estimated and compared with field observations table 3 the estimated hydraulic conductivity of fast recession period k 1 varying from 1 5 10 3 m s 1 for zhongzhou basin to 6 0 10 4 m s 1 for tuku basin the estimated hydraulic conductivity of slow recession period k 2 varying from 1 2 10 4 m s 1 for chaoliao basin to 7 26 10 5 m s 1 for tuku basin the estimated values indicated that the slow recession period has average k value in the order of 10 5 m s 1 while fast recession period has 10 4 m s 1 the comparison of average estimated k 1 and k 2 hydraulic conductivity with observed one at each site indicated that the estimated values are reasonable and can be used further for groundwater flow modeling using numerical models for example at meinong site in alluvium aquifer the estimated k e 3 07 10 4 m s 1 while k o observed 4 0 10 4 m s 1 similarly at qishan site k e 1 57 10 4 and k o 5 80 10 4 m s 1 but at zhaoming site there is underestimation i e k e 5 3 10 4 and k o 1 79 10 6 m s 1 4 4 groundwater recharge estimation recharge rate during rainy season may to october per year from 2001 to 2019 at each site was calculated using eq 4 the same s y values of each site were adopted here table 3 calculated recharge substantially varies in magnitude from 1472 mm year 1 43 of mean annual rainfall on average at xinwei site to 244 mm year 1 12 of mean annual rainfall at zhaoming site from highland basin to lowland basins as shown in table 4 the variations in estimated recharge using wtf method indicated that it could be influenced by differences in geology elevation land surface slope etc lee et al 2006 according to the geological formations of study area most of the observations wells lies in alluvium aquifer such as meinong jiyang jiyang gz tuku and showed maximum recharge rate i e 34 52 of seasonal annual rainfall the slightly lower average recharge rates of 406 812 mm year 1 were obtained for qishan zhongzhou and ligang sites which represent 20 31 of the annual rainfall while dashu jiuqu chaoliao and zhaoming sites represent 12 31 the slightly lower recharge rates for these sites compared to high recharge rate sites suggest that a small portion of rain infiltrate in the subsoil may travel down gradient via lateral flow within the layer which is consistent with general hillslope recharge mechanisms salve et al 2012 the recharge rates estimated in this study using the wtf method may contain uncertainty because the specific yield values were estimated not obtained from the reliable field methods in addition the recharge rates are estimated in shallow aquifer in shallow depths aquifer the impact of the capillary pressure on specific yield estimate is dependent on the heights of the capillary fringe in subsoil and transition zones for the extreme cases where the depth to water table is less than the height of the capillary pressure no water is released when water levels change healy and scanlon 2010 to quantify the uncertainty of the recharge estimates field studies with sophisticated field instrumentations are required to estimate specific yield for different geological units which is beyond the scope of this study in addition it is important to recognize that the recharge rates estimated for the shallow layers of subsoil and transition zones do not necessarily represent those in the deeper bedrock units 4 5 groundwater level modeling using wash123d numerical model in the last 2 d 3 d coupled finite element wash123d model is constructed in gms environment and simulated in transient condition with the help of estimated parameters the prior estimated hydraulic conductivity using water table response to rainfall relationship only provides information in alluvium formation and these values were used to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of other formations such as pleistocene pliocene to miocene as an initial guess due to non availability of observation wells in these formations the hydraulic conductivity values were comparatively supposed to use the hypothesis of alluvium to non alluvium formation i e the alluvium formation has good permeability than non alluvium formations the k values of linkou and tashe formations belong to pleistocene were assumed by one order and ¬Ω order reduction in magnitude from alluvium holocene formation respectively similarly for pliocene to miocene we reduce the k values up to 2 2 ¬Ω order magnitude from holocene as shown in table 5 after setting the model and steady state simulation the following transient simulation results for a real time case scenario using rainfall and pumping data for the event from 8 01 2019 0 00 to 8 22 2019 23 00 were obtained figs 10 and 11 first the simulation was performed without considering the pumping data and compared with observations the overestimation of simulated groundwater levels indicated that the natural forcing ensures enough recharge but there are pumping wells operated by different stakeholders the selected event has three continuous rainfall spells starting from 8 12 2019 0 00 to 8 18 2019 23 00 that probably provide enough rainfall recharge to compensate for the pumping effects the rising and recessing patterns of simulated groundwater levels before and after rainfall is similar to the observed record figs 10 and 11 indicate that the simulated results are fairly consistent with the observations although the simulation results are slightly overestimated may be due to no consideration of pumping data the aquifer response to the recharge discharge phenomenon is obvious through the simulation results and observed groundwater levels the rising limb of hydrographs indicating the recharging of aquifers and the groundwater level response to heavy rainfall indicating the time lag was about 1 day for the observation wells in this area the model performance evaluation and credibility were assessed through six statistical measures and the calculated values are shown in table 6 overall model performance is better based on the moriasi et al 2015 criteria the mae rmse and pbias values indicate the overestimation of simulations the nse kge and r2 values were found greater than 0 79 and mae rmse 0 25 m indicating satisfactory model performance without pumping data simulation overall the proposed simulation method and parameters are considered acceptable for further simulation using pumping data considering pumping as major stress on the system the numerical simulation was performed for a real case scenario using pumping and rainfall data together for the assessment of pumping effect on the groundwater levels at qishan and zhongzhou locations 13 pumping wells are under seventh branch taiwan water corporation for commercial and household water supply there is continuous pumping as can be seen from fig 10 the average total pumping rate is 1 303 m3 s of 13 pumping wells that drop the average groundwater level approximately 0 10 0 50 m in qishan 2 and zhongzhou 2 observation wells moreover the pumping record regularizes the groundwater levels according to the observations that indicated the dynamics of recharge and discharge phenomena in the aquifer similarly the xipu 2 observation well site has 11 pumping wells under formosa plastics corporation continuously pumping water at an average total rate of 0 412 m3 s for their demand according to the pumping record of the selected time as shown in fig 11 the continuous pumping rate drops the groundwater level 0 10 0 25 m on averagely of xipu 2 observation well from the results it is obvious that the continuous pumping decreases the groundwater level but due to available recharge from rainfall the drop in levels is not abrupt and the aquifer system showed the continuum process but for the long term subjectivity of sustained groundwater pumping and sustainability of aquifer the model simulations should be performed for long recession period generally speaking the illegal unregulated pumping in this area is one of the key issues that must be addressed through numerical simulation in advance studies in addition the pumping is mostly done in aquifer 2 a similar pattern comparison with observed water levels data indicated the reasonable hydrological response of groundwater levels to rainfall and pumping data the nse kge and r2 values 0 96 showed that the results with pumping data are very good the other values of statistical indicators mae 0 010 0 036 m rmse 0 014 0 052 m and pbias 0 01 to 0 10 indicating that the simulated results are also very slightly overestimated during real time case scenarios overall the simulation results with and without pumping data are relatively comparable with observations and there is a reasonable hydrological response of groundwater levels to rainfall and pumping data 5 conclusions in this study long term daily observed records of 16 rainfall stations and 13 groundwater level stations in sub regional area of kaohsiung city taiwan were used to evaluate the groundwater level response to rainfall and determine the recharge potential for shallow aquifer a good linear correlation relationship was found between groundwater level responses to associated rainfall we show a simple approach to estimate specific yield s y and hydraulic conductivity k from water table rise and drop during wet season may to october and dry season november to april respectively s y was estimated from the inverse of the slope of relationship between water level response to associated rainfall while the k was estimated with the relationship between recession constant Œ± aquifer half width b effective aquifer thickness d master recession curve mrc analysis using matching strip method was used to determine Œ± of fast flow recession period and slow flow recession period the fast and slow recession segments of mrc represent higher and lower permeability aquifer respectively the other parameters b and d were estimated using dem data in gis environment and lithology data respectively it was estimated that the k values of fast recession were one order larger than slow recession segment the proposed method indirectly determine the hydraulic parameters s y k with simply two data set i e groundwater level and rainfall recharge rate was estimated from groundwater level fluctuations wtf method and employs values of specific yield derived from proposed method in this study results showed the annual recharge rates of 244 1472 mm year 1 which represent 12 43 of rainfall in the study area the estimated k order of 10 4 10 5 m s 1 and s y 0 20 0 51 were used as prior values for groundwater numerical modeling wash123d was selected as an appropriate protocol for the simulation of 2 d surface and 3 d groundwater interactions the model simulations were performed with and without consideration of pumping data the performance of model results was assessed through six statistical indicators and their values were found close to the highest agreement indicating the reasonable hydrological response of groundwater levels to rainfall and pumping data overall the simulation results are relatively comparable with observations indicating that wash123d is an appropriate protocol to investigate the surface subsurface interaction in the selected study region and should be a credible approach for future research work and management of groundwater resources the real time case scenario simulation using pumping and rainfall data indicated the dynamics of recharge and discharge phenomena in the aquifer and the aquifer system showed the continuum process but for the long term subjectivity of sustained groundwater pumping and sustainability of aquifer wash123d simulations should be performed for long period for

8076,study region the qinghai lake basin qinghai tibetan plateau the qinghai lake is the largest inland saltwater lake in china study focus significant increase in runoff into the qinghai lake has been reported however the relationship between frozen soil changes and runoff remains poorly understood this study investigated the temporal and spatial variations in frozen soil and associate effects on streamflow and soil moisture in the study region by a distributed eco hydrological model new hydrological insights the results illustrate that the coverage of permafrost decreased by about 13 from 1971 to 2015 and permafrost degradation mainly occurred in the elevation interval of 3600 4200 m the maximum frozen depth averaged in the seasonally frozen ground significantly decreased by 0 06 m 10a while the active layer thickness averaged in the permafrost enhanced by 0 02 m 10a permafrost degradation caused enhanced soil liquid water storage and an increase in freezing season runoff the increase in runoff in the thawing season was dominated by changes in precipitation the results suggest that frozen soil degradation altered the seasonal flow regime leading to lags in the monthly runoff peak and it increased the base flow and reduced the thawing season runoff this offset of the competing impacts of frozen soil changes in different seasons led to a negative effect on annual runoff this study provides new understandings of cryospheric hydrological responses to climate change keywords the qinghai lake basin frozen soil change climate change runoff distributed hydrological model 1 introduction frozen soil is defined as soil and rock containing ice at or below 0 c it has an essential influence on land atmosphere interactions terrestrial ecosystems and hydrological cycles in the earth s land system cao et al 2018 gao et al 2021 yang et al 2019 depending on the duration of the frozen state frozen soil can be classified as the seasonally frozen ground and permafrost seasonally frozen ground is ground that freezes and thaws during the year evans and ge 2017 permafrost is ground that maintains at or below 0 c for at least two continuous years washburn 1973 woo 2012 triggered by climate warming changes in frozen soil particularly the degradation of permafrost have been extensively confirmed biskaborn et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 frozen soil degradation includes the thickening of the active layer of permafrost walvoord and kurylyk 2016 thinning of the frozen depth of the seasonally frozen ground huang and zhou 2012 and degradation from permafrost to seasonally frozen ground jin et al 2011 cao et al 2021 frozen soil degradation has significantly changed the hydrological processes in cold regions liljedahl et al 2016 it can greatly influence the hydrogeologic connectivity and water flow pathways lamontagne halle et al 2018 which alter the water resource supply for headwater catchments in cold regions and their downstream areas woo et al 2008 therefore investigating the hydrological impact of frozen soil changes has received rapidly increasing attention worldwide jin et al 2021 the qinghai tibetan plateau qtp is called the asian water tower immerzeel et al 2010 and permafrost covers more than 40 of the qtp cheng et al 2019 affected by global warming permafrost on the plateau is getting warmer and thinner wu et al 2010 luo et al 2018 and previous studies suggested that the areas of permafrost degraded from about 177 104 km2 in 1980 150 104 km2 in 2010 guo and wang 2013 previous studies suggested that the permafrost degradation has caused significant changes in alpine hydrology on the plateau chen et al 2018 kong and wang 2017 wang et al 2018 shi et al 2020 thus studies of permafrost change and its hydrological impact have extensive scientific significance on the qtp however the relationships between frozen soil degradation and the hydrological changes exhibit large differences at different temporal and spatial scales and how frozen soil changes influence the hydrological cycles and streamflow in the headwater catchments over the qtp remains difficult to quantify and needs a comprehensive study zhao et al 2020 due to the cold environment and high elevations field work is difficult on the qtp and observations usually can only identify changes at the plot scale or within a small experimental catchment therefore some hydrological models coupled with frozen soil processes have been developed or applied to analyze the changes in the hydrological processes in the alpine catchments over the qtp for example cuo et al 2015 studied the impact of frozen soil changes on surface hydrology on the qtp using the frozen soil coupled variable infiltration capacity vic model they mainly focused on the trends in soil temperature and soil moisture at multiple stations and their impact on streamflow in the source area of the yellow river sayr zheng et al 2018 analyzed the effect of the soil freezing thawing cycle on the streamflow based on the noah land surface model simulation sun et al 2020 quantified the responses of the main hydrological elements to permafrost degradation using the water balance simulation model wasim in the sayr wang et al 2009a 2009b developed the water and energy budget based distributed hydrological model web dhm and subsequently implemented a snow and frozen soil module into this model wang et al 2017 this improved model was recently employed to simulate the frozen soil changes at typical sites in the sayr song et al 2020 there are over 32 000 lakes on the qtp accounting for about half of the total area of china s lakes zhang et al 2014 some hydrological models have also been applied to analyze the changes in the hydrological processes over the lake basins on the qtp the web dhm was utilized to estimate the changes in water balance in the lake selin co basin and nam co basin zhou et al 2015 2016 zhong et al 2020 the vic model was applied to calculate the contribution of glacier runoff in the selin co lake storage changes tong et al 2016 the j2000g model was employed in four lake basins on the southern central qtp to compare the differences in the variations of water balance biskop et al 2016 however frozen soil was not studied in detail in these researches on lake basins due to the large heterogeneity in topography and significant differences in the temporal trends in climatology the hydrological response to frozen soil change has great spatial and temporal variations which have not been sufficiently investigated in previous studies it is difficult to distinguish the effect of frozen soil degradation from other factors and conflicting findings were reported with negative effect wang et al 2018 shi et al 2020 and positive effect walvoord et al 2012 sun et al 2020 of frozen soil degradation on annual runoff therefore the influence of frozen soil changes on hydrological processes at the catchment scale is still not fully understood the qinghai lake basin is located on the northeastern region of the qtp which is an important barrier to maintaining the ecological security in the qtp zhang et al 2013 all the rivers in this basin flow into the qinghai lake which is the largest saline lake in china su et al 2020 during the past 50 years the water level of this lake decreased in the period of 1971 2004 and it started to rise since 2005 previous studies found that the trend of the runoff into the lake was basically consistent with the changes in the water level of the lake which increased from 2005 dong et al 2018 the increase in runoff into the lake has been considered as the major cause of the increase in the water level of this lake du et al 2020 and there are debates about why runoff has increased in the qinghai lake basin li et al 2020 fan et al 2021 which has experienced large changes in precipitation and melting of continuous permafrost zhou et al 2000 therefore the attribution of the runoff changes in this basin remains unclear previous studies have investigated the changes in river flow in the qinghai lake basin using hydrological models shu et al 2008 revealed the annual runoff changes in the qinghai lake basin based on the swat model simulation and evaluated the effect of climate and vegetation cover change on runoff long et al 2016 constructed a distributed physically based hydrological model for the qinghai lake basin and simulated the streamflow changes ma et al 2018 estimated the water balance of the qinghai lake basin by combining the field observations and hydrological modeling approach however the soil freeze thaw process was lacking in these modeling studies and the influence of the cryosphere on the hydrological process was not well understood therefore how the spatial and temporal variations of frozen soil affect the hydrological processes in the qinghai lake basin still needs to be further studied in recent years the gbehm model geomorphology based eco hydrological model was developed for simulating the effect of climate change on the catchment hydrology in alpine regions yang et al 2015 gao et al 2016 2018 the gbehm fully couples the hydrological processes and the cryospheric processes and it has been successfully applied to study the hydrological changes in cryosphere watersheds on the qtp including the source area of the yangtze river the yellow river and the heihe river table 1 therefore based on the gbehm model the objective of this study is to 1 investigate the temporal and spatial changes in frozen soil in the qinghai lake basin from 1971 to 2015 2 analyze the changes in the water balance in the qinghai lake basin and 3 quantify the response of runoff and soil moisture to frozen soil degradation from 1971 to 2015 2 study area and data the qinghai lake basin locates in the northeastern part of the qtp fig 1 within 97 50 e 101 20 e and 36 15 n 38 20 n the terrain of the qinghai lake basin decreases in elevation from the northwest to the southeast and the average altitude is approximately 4000 m the annual air temperature in this basin ranges from 1 1 4 0 c and the average annual precipitation is about 363 mm yi et al 2010 in this basin approximately 40 rivers merge into the qinghai lake and five major rivers in the northwestern part account for 83 of the total runoff into the lake permafrost covers a large fraction of the basin and it mainly locates in the northwestern part at high elevations and seasonally frozen ground covers the regions at low elevations each of these two types of frozen soil accounts for approximately 50 of the total area of the qinghai lake basin zou et al 2017 the depth of the lower boundary of the permafrost in this basin is estimated to vary in the range of 2 50 m using empirical formulas yan 2020 the topography data used in this study was the dem provided by the srtm product jarvis et al 2008 at 90 m spatial resolution the distribution of vegetation type were obtained from the qinghai tibetan plateau vegetation map on a scale of 1 1 000 000 provided by the national earth system science data center data on the location area and storage volume of glaciers were provided by the glacier survey of china wu and li 2004 the vegetation types were reclassified into 10 typologies in the study basin fig 2 fig 2 shows that glaciers are mainly located in the headwater regions with an area of 35 96 km2 which covers 0 12 of the whole basin area the alpine steppe is primarily found in the downstream region around the lake and the alpine meadow is the main vegetation type in the study basin the leaf area index lai and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fpar provided by the gimms data zhu et al 2013 were used to represent the vegetation changes in the model simulation the soil water parameters with a spatial resolution of 1 km including soil physical property parameters and soil hydraulic parameters were obtained from dai et al 2013 and were used for the model simulation meteorological observations at national stations including the daily air temperature wind speed sunshine hours and relative humidity were available during period of 1971 2015 from the china meteorological administration cma http cdc cma gov cn these meteorological data were interpolated into a 1 5 km grid system by the distance and direction weighting method to generate the atmospheric forcing of the hydrological model and elevation dependent gradient of the air temperature based on the estimations by previous researches in the study basin li et al 2013 wang 2014 ma et al 2019 was considered in the interpolation the gridded daily precipitation data derived from the cgdpa china gauge based daily precipitation analysis product developed by shen and xiong 2016 which was interpolated by station observed data records were also applied as the forcing of the model simulation the gridded precipitation data of cmfd china meteorological forcing data provided by yang et al 2010 and he and yang 2020 were also collected the daily flow discharge data during the period of 1981 1984 and 2006 2014 and the annual river discharge in the period of 1971 2015 observed at the buhahekou station were collected from the hydrology and water resources bureau of the qinghai province china the drainage basin area of the buhahekou station is 14 337 km2 which represents approximately 55 of the whole area of the study basin the monthly river discharge data in the period of 2011 2014 observed at the gangcha station located at the shaliu river with a drainage area of 1442 km2 was also obtained from the hydrology and water resources bureau of the qinghai province china the ground temperature observed at the depths of 0 05 m 0 1 m 0 15 m 0 2 m 0 4 m 0 8 m 1 6 m and 3 2 m from the gangcha station during the period of 2004 2011 was also provided by cma the remote sensing based gleam global land evapotranspiration amsterdam model evaporation product with a spatial resolution of 0 25 martens et al 2017 in the period of 2001 2015 was used to validate the model simulated evaporation 3 method the gbehm was used to simulate the changes in hydrological process of the qinghai lake basin and we used a 1 5 1 5 km grid system to discretely delineate the whole basin a series of hillslopes and valleys was identified within each grid yang et al 2015 gao et al 2016 the study basin was divided into 295 subcatchments and a number of flow intervals alongside the major river channel of each subcatchment were identified in a flow interval a series of hillslopes were symmetrically distributed along both sides of the river and the hillslope was the basic unit for the model simulation yang et al 1998 the slope gradient slope length and aspect of each hillslope unit were calculated by the dem data with 90 m resolution hydrological processes including surface runoff generation infiltration evapotranspiration snowmelt soil water movement and heat transfer were calculated on the hillslope unit yang et al 2002 2015 the soil freeze thaw process is solved based on the soil water heat coupling balance method and the soil water balance is calculated using the one dimensional richards equation celia et al 1990 considering the convective heat associated with soil heat conduction the heat of phase change and liquid water movement the energy budget equation is presented as follows flerchinger and saxton 1989 1 c s t t œÅ i l i Œ∏ i t z Œª s t z œÅ l c l q l t z 0 where c s is the specific heat capacity of the

calculates the amount of glacier melt through estimating the net heat absorbed by the glacier gbehm used a multilayer snow cover model and the snow albedo was calculated by estimating the solar radiation transfer in the snow layers based on the snicar snow ice and aerosol radiative module toon et al 1989 a mass and energy balance method is used to simulate the snowmelt process jordan 1991 bartelt and lehning 2002 the surface runoff is determined using the kinematic wave method and the flow between the river water and the unconfined aquifer is calculated by darcy s law the actual evaporation is calculated using the method developed by sellers et al 1996 the details for the gbehm model description is available in gao et al 2016 2018 yang et al 2015 and li et al 2019 we used a time step of 1 h to run the model and the hydrological processes from 1971 to 2015 in the study basin were simulated in addition to this normal run we also simulated runoff in the following scenarios the wo fg scenario scenario without frozen soil the only warming scenario and the only wetting scenario with the absence of frozen soil the phase transformation of liquid and solid in soil water was not taken into account in the wo fg scenario therefore soil was not freeze thawed and the calculation of other processes in this scenario were the same as that in normal run this scenario is designed to clarify the influence of frozen soil degradation on streamflow changes in the only warming scenario the precipitation input in 1971 was repeated every year in the study period so the inter annual trend in precipitation was removed while the other meteorological input were the same as that in the normal run in the only wetting scenario the air temperature input in 1971 was repeated every year in the study period so the warming trend in air temperature was removed while the other meteorological input were also the same as that in the normal run the purpose of these two scenarios was to assess the impact of increased precipitation and air temperature on hydrological processes 4 results 4 1 model validation to calibrate and validate the model the daily river discharge measured at the buhahekou hydrological station was used the observed ground temperature at the gangcha meteorological station was also used to validate the model simulation the major calibrated model parameters are the maximum surface storage land surface roughness the coefficient of groundwater permeability and soil reflectance to visible light and near infrared radiation table s1 the period of 1981 1984 was used for model calibration based on the period of available daily river discharge data and the validation period was 2011 2014 fig 3 shows the comparison between the simulated and measured daily river flow at the buhahekou station the simulated daily river discharge agreed well with the observations at this station in the calibration period the nse was 0 66 and the re was 2 80 fig 3 a in the validation period the nse was 0 64 and the re was 6 61 fig 3 b fig s1 shows the comparison between the simulated and observed monthly river discharge at the gangcha station in the validation period the nse of the model simulated monthly river discharge was 0 73 suggesting an acceptable accuracy these results indicate that the gbehm can well simulate the streamflow in the study basin fig 4 shows the comparison of model simulated monthly evaporation and the gleam evaporation in the period of 2001 2015 the gbehm showed acceptable accuracy in simulating evaporation with rmse of 2 37 mm and r2 of 0 89 in the period of 2001 2015 fig 5 compares the model simulated and observed daily ground temperatures at the gangcha station it can be seen from the figure that the variations in the simulated ground temperature agreed well with the observations from 2004 2011 the simulated maximum frozen depth was approximately 1 5 m which was close to the observations of 1 6 m the simulated ground temperature had a decreasing tendency of rmses as soil depth increased the rmses at depths lower than 20 cm were approximately 3 0 c and the rmse decreased to 1 9 c at a depth of 40 cm and 1 6 c at 80 cm the rmses at the 160 cm and 320 cm were approximately 1 3 c these results indicate that the model performance in simulating the soil freeze thaw process was acceptable 4 2 spatial and temporal changes in frozen soil the soil freeze began in early november in the qinghai lake basin and the soil thaw started in the middle of april as reported in previous studies li et al 2018 zhang and li 2018 therefore we designate the year into two seasons a freezing season from november to march and a thawing season from april to october fig 6 displays the changes of the simulated basin averaged seasonal ground temperature it can be seen from the figure that the ground temperature increased in both the two seasons in the freezing season the mean annual ground temperature of the deep layer 240 290 cm was 1 35 c which was approximately 5 c higher than that of the shallow layer 0 50 cm fig 6 a in the thawing season the opposite was found fig 6 b and the shallow layer had a mean annual ground temperature which was approximately 5 c higher than the deep layer in the freezing season the shallow soil layer had an increasing trend in the basin averaged ground temperature 0 39 c 10a which was greater than that in the thawing season 0 18 c 10a while in the deeper layer the increasing trend in the ground temperature 0 35 c 10a in the thawing season was slightly larger than that in the freezing season 0 32 c 10a fig 7 shows the changes in the distribution of permafrost during the periods of 1971 1980 and 2001 2015 the coverage of permafrost was 1 27 104 km2 in the period of 1971 1980 and it shrunk to 1 10 104 km2 in the period of 2001 2015 with a reduction of 1700 km2 13 3 the degradation of permafrost primarily occurred in the regions with elevations between 3600 m and 4200 m fig 7 c and d changes in the area of permafrost in the period from 1971 to 2015 were generally identical to the rising air temperature fig 8 a fig 8 b illustrates the changes in the active layer thickness of permafrost and the maximum frozen depth of the seasonally frozen ground in the qinghai lake basin in the period from 1971 to 2015 the basin averaged active layer thickness of permafrost exhibited a significantly increasing trend p 0 005 at a rate of 0 02 m 10a the maximum frozen depth averaged in the seasonally frozen ground had a remarkable decreasing rate of 0 06 m 10a p 0 001 indicating a greater change in magnitude than the active layer thickness of permafrost 4 3 changes in the water balance the changes in the water balance in the qinghai lake basin are shown in fig 9 and table 2 the basin averaged mean annual precipitation evaporation and runoff in the period from 1971 to 2015 were 403 2 mm 363 5 mm and 49 5 mm respectively fig 9 shows the spatial variation in precipitation evaporation and runoff in the period from 1971 to 1980 and the period from 2001 to 2015 the spatial changes in annual evaporation and runoff were generally consistent with those in precipitation precipitation and runoff were mainly concentrated in the northwestern part of the basin at high elevations in this region the maximum annual precipitation was over 600 mm and the maximum annual runoff was over 200 mm this finding indicates that the areas with high elevations are the main source regions for runoff generation the annual precipitation evaporation and runoff had decadal variations and all reached their maximum values in the period from 2001 2015 the snowmelt and glacial runoff contributed a small fraction to the annual runoff and little increase in them during the period of 1971 2015 was found this finding indicates that increases in snowmelt and glacier runoff were not the dominant drivers of the increase in runoff in the study basin fig 10 compares the simulated annual runoff and observations at the buhahekou hydrological station from 1971 to 2015 and the inter annual variations in the glacier and snowmelt runoff the variation in simulated annual runoff agrees well with the observations r 2 0 82 the observed annual runoff had a significant increasing trend which was also captured by the model simulation this result also illustrates that gbehm had acceptable skill in simulating the runoff changes in the study basin the variations of glacier and snowmelt runoff were generally the same as annual total runoff and no significant trend was found the multi year average of glacier and snowmelt runoff was 10 8 mm this result is consistent with the findings in previous studies that glaciers and snowmelt provided quite limited runoff in the study basin jin et al 2013 wang et al 2016 4 4 effects of frozen soil change on soil moisture and runoff 4 4 1 effect of frozen soil change on soil moisture the alterations in the basin averaged value of annual soil liquid water 0 3 m and soil ice 0 3 m in the period from 1971 to 2015 are displayed in fig 11 the soil liquid water exhibited a remarkable increasing tendency and the ice content 0 3 m exhibited an evident decrease triggered by the degradation of frozen soil fig 12 illustrates the changes in the spatially averaged soil liquid water content from 1971 to 2015 at the elevation interval of 3200 3600 m which was mainly seasonally frozen ground and the regions with elevations ranging from 3600 to 4200 m where permafrost degradation mainly occurred in the low elevations of 3200 3600 m covered by seasonally frozen ground reduction of frozen depth caused a slightly increase in the liquid soil moisture fig 12 a at regions with elevations between 3600 and 4200 m the transition from permafrost to seasonally frozen ground after 2000 led to a dramatic increase in soil liquid water content in deep soils this result suggests that the effect of frozen soil changes on hydrological processes has spatial characteristics the degradation of permafrost into seasonally frozen ground tended to have a larger impact on soil moisture than the changes in seasonally frozen ground fig s2 compares the regime of soil liquid water content and soil ice with precipitation at monthly scale in the period from 1971 to 1980 period 1 and the period from 2001 2015 period 2 in the qinghai lake basin as seen from the figure the soil liquid water and soil ice have an annual cycle the simulated soil ice began to melt in march and it gradually melted during april september the soil liquid water reached its peak around september as soil ice melted the pattern of soil liquid water was opposite that of soil ice and soil ice started to increase in october and peaked in winter december to february from period 1 to period 2 soil liquid water increased and soil ice decreased with little change in their monthly patterns 4 4 2 effect of frozen soil change on runoff the variations in annual runoff and precipitation with elevation in the period of 1971 1980 and the period of 2001 2015 are shown in fig 13 generally runoff and precipitation in the study basin increased with increasing elevation runoff and precipitation both reached their maximum values at elevations of 4500 4600 m precipitation and runoff increased from 1971 to 1980 2001 2015 however the seasonal differences in the runoff changes were evident from the period of 1971 1980 to the period of 2001 2015 the increase in the runoff in the thawing season and annual runoff were generally consistent with the enhanced precipitation on the contrary the largest runoff changes in the freezing season was found in the regions with elevations of 3600 4200 where the frozen soil types changed from permafrost to the seasonally frozen ground this result indicates that permafrost degradation dominated the runoff increase during the freezing season and the permafrost degradation exerted greater effect on runoff than the seasonally frozen ground changes the increased runoff during the thawing season seemed mainly caused by the increase in precipitation streamflow in the freezing season was mainly generated by the interflow released from deep soils layers permafrost degradation leads to an increase in the infiltration and melting of soil ice which enhances deep soil liquid water storage and increases the soil hydraulic conductivity this change has a positive effect on the interflow generation from deep soil layers for the purpose of further investigating the implication of frozen soil on runoff in the thawing season and annual runoff we compared the runoff simulated in the normal run and three scenarios wo fg only warming and only wetting fig 14 displays the comparison of the annual and seasonal runoff simulated in the normal run and the three scenarios the annual runoff simulated in the only warming scenario showed no significant tendency because the increasing trend in annual precipitation was removed while the simulated annual runoff in the other three cases were increasing fig 14 a this finding suggests that the increasing in annual runoff in the study basin was mainly caused by enhanced precipitation without the air temperature warming the simulated annual runoff in the only wetting scenario was higher than that in the normal run this result indicates that the warming trend in air temperature had a negative effect on annual runoff fig 14 b presents the multi year average annual and seasonal runoff the multi year average annual runoff in the wo fg scenario was 14 9 mm lower than that in the normal run this result confirms that frozen soil degradation reduced the annual runoff the freezing season runoff simulated in the wo fg scenario was 9 0 mm which was larger than that in the normal run 4 3 mm in the thawing season the runoff in the wo fg scenario 36 4 mm was lower than that in the normal run 51 1 mm these results were consistent with the findings revealed in fig 13 the impact of frozen soil change on the annual runoff was determined by the offset of its negative effect on the thawing season runoff and the positive effect on freezing season runoff in the only warming scenario without the increasing trend of precipitation frozen soil degradation was still retained due to the warming trend in air temperature in this scenario runoff in the freezing season was also larger than that in the normal run and runoff in the thawing season was lower than that in the normal run these results also suggest that frozen soil degradation increased the runoff in the freezing season and reduced the runoff in the thawing season fig 15 shows that there is an annual anticlockwise hysteresis loop in the results of simulation in the normal run and the wo fg scenario the runoff enhanced from march to july and as precipitation decreased during the non flood season it declined from september to december however the size of the hysteresis loop in the wo fg scenario was larger than that in the normal run this is because that runoff increased during the freezing season and decreased during the thawing season compared with the normal run as mentioned above fig 16 shows the average monthly precipitation simulated runoff soil liquid moisture and soil ice content in the qinghai lake basin in the period from 1971 to 2015 the variation in monthly runoff in the normal run was consistent with that in precipitation in the wo fg scenario the runoff peak had a one month delay compared with that in the normal run the reason for this result is that the existence of ice in the frozen soil forms an impermeable layer which reduces infiltration in the wo fg scenario with the absence of frozen soil more precipitation infiltrates into the deep soil which reduces the direct response of surface and shallow lateral runoff to precipitation and therefore causes a lag in the monthly runoff peak therefore the soil freeze thaw process has an essential effect on the monthly runoff regime in the qinghai lake basin and the changes in frozen soil significantly influence the precipitation runoff hysteresis loops as shown in fig 15 fig s3 shows the daily hydrograph at the buhahekou station in 2011 in the normal run and in the wo fg scenario the flood peak in the wo fg scenario is lower than that in the normal run these results suggest that frozen soil degradation has a substantial effect on the flow regime which may alter seasonal pattern of the runoff leading to a decrease in the flood peak and an increase in the base flow 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with previous similar studies 5 1 1 frozen soil simulation yuan 2016 analyzed the changes in the averaged annual maximum frozen depth obtained by observation in the last 30 years 1981 2014 at three sites one is the gongcha station and two stations are outside the basin they found that the maximum value of frozen depth was 188 cm in 1984 and that the minimum was 127 cm in 2006 this is basically consistent with the results simulated by the model in this study at the grid where the gangcha station located which estimated that the maximum and minimum values of the frozen depth occurred in 1984 153 cm and 2006 125 cm respectively in this study the area of permafrost in the period from 2001 to 2015 was estimated to be 1 10 104 km2 which is slightly lower than the widely used map proposed by zou et al 2017 the modis land surface temperature in the period of 2003 2012 was adopted in their work to map the distribution of permafrost on the whole qtp using the ttop temperature at the top of permafrost model and they estimated the area of permafrost in the qinghai lake basin to be 1 24 104 km2 our results differ from that of zou et al 2017 and this deviation may be related to the different models and data used in addition the study period of this research is longer than the study period of zou et al 2017 and degradation of permafrost has continued since 2012 therefore the results of the frozen soil simulation in our study are reasonable 5 1 2 effect of frozen soil change on hydrological processes our study shows that the changes in annual runoff varied with elevation which basically agrees with the results of zhang et al 2017 more over our results further distinguished different influences of frozen soil change on streamflow at the seasonal scale section 4 displays that the impact of permafrost degradation on streamflow had seasonal characteristics and it caused an increase in runoff in the cold season and decreased runoff in the thawing season this result basically agrees with the findings of sun et al 2020 in the sayr our results also suggested that the frozen soil degradation altered the monthly flow regime increased base flow and reduced the flood peak in summer fig 15 fig 16 and fig s3 these findings are consistent with those of gao et al 2018 in the upper heihe basin and those of niu et al 2016 in the sayr our results suggest that soil warming and frozen soil change had an effect of reducing the annual runoff which is similar with the conclusions of wang et al 2018 in the upper heihe river basin and those of shi et al 2020 in the source region of the yangtze river however this finding is different from the result of sun et al 2020 who found that the degradation of permafrost led to an increase in the annual discharge in most regions in the sayr by the wasim model simulation this deviation may be related to the unique characteristics of cryosphere hydrological cycles in the sayr which cause different offsets of the positive and negative impacts of frozen soil change on streamflow components between seasons the results of this study suggest that the changes in frozen soil enhanced the soil water content this finding is similar with that of jorgenson et al 2001 who found that permafrost degradation resulted in a substantial increase in soil moisture in central alaska this result is also consistent with the findings of gao et al 2018 in the upper heihe basin bordering the north of the study basin and those of cuo et al 2015 at some stations on the eastern qtp however this result is different from the findings of zhang et al 2019 who argued that permafrost degradation reduced soil moisture in the active layer based on a coupled model simulation zhang et al 2016 at one site in the source region of the yangtze river the possible reason of such difference may be that zhang et al 2019 focused on the thaw depth changes at only one site at which soil moisture decreased mainly due to the increase in evaporation in this study at the basin scale changes in soil moisture were dominated by the melting of soil ice associated with the permafrost degradation to the seasonally frozen ground the results of this study were also different from those of sun et al 2020 who argued that permafrost degradation resulted in soil moisture to decline in the mountain regions in the sayr by model simulation the difference between our results and those of sun et al 2020 may be relevant to the different hydrogeological conditions between the sayr and the qinghai lake basin in addition in the sayr sun et al 2020 found that the liquid soil moisture decreased due to enhanced groundwater recharge whereas in this study we found a positive impact of soil ice melting on the liquid soil moisture which was not considered in the work of sun et al 2020 these results highlight the complex competing effect of frozen soil degradation on liquid soil moisture including the positive effect of ground ice melting and the negative effect of water loss by increased evaporation and groundwater recharge on the other hand the effects of frozen soil degradation on soil water content are also affected by different seasons and soil depths cuo et al 2015 therefore the complex mechanism of frozen soil degradation on soil moisture in the qtp still needs further investigation in future works 5 2 uncertainties and limitations there are uncertainties in the numerical simulation of the gbehm model in our study including uncertainties in the meteorological inputs vegetation and soil parameters in particular the uncertainties in the precipitation input may influence the accuracy of our results in the qinghai lake basin compared to the land ground the large heat flux of the lake will cause changes in the wind temperature humidity and precipitation around the lake this phenomenon is called the lake effect su et al 2020 this effect may have a certain influence on the surrounding climate and is not fully considered in the current precipitation datasets applied in the qtp due to sparse distributions of the ground sites in the study basin we compared the results of this study with the simulations using precipitation from cmfd dataset as input see fig s4 tables s2 s3 the cmfd dataset has been widely used on the qtp he and yang 2020 zhou et al 2015 2016 zhong et al 2020 the results in this study by the cgdpa precipitation performed better than the simulations by the cmfd precipitation except in a few years such as 2010 in which the cgdpa precipitation overestimated the flood season runoff fig s4 the nse of the simulated river discharge at the buhahekou station by cmfd precipitation in the period of 1981 1984 and 2011 2014 was 0 57 and 0 36 which was significantly lower than that of the simulations by cgdpa precipitation table s2 this result was related to a great underestimation of river discharges by the cmfd precipitation due to its unreasonable low values compared with the period of 1981 1984 the observed river discharge significantly increased in the period of 2011 2014 implying an evident increase in precipitation amount which was consistent with changes in the cgdpa precipitation however the cmfd precipitation in the period of 2011 2014 was close to that in the period of 1981 1984 which resulted in a significant underestimation of annual river discharge with re of 39 83 table s2 and table s3 this underestimation was more evident in flood years for example the observed annual river discharge at the buhahekou station in 2012 was 59 58 m3 s which was much larger than the observed average river discharge in the period of 2011 2014 40 35 m3 s implying a large precipitation amount in 2012 however the cmfd precipitation in 2012 was only 356 2 mm which was much lower than its mean value in 2011 2014 424 5 mm leading to an unreasonable low value of simulated river discharge table s3 these results suggest that the cgdpa precipitation is more reasonable and accurate than the cmfd precipitation therefore the cgdpa precipitation is more suitable for simulating the runoff in the qinghai lake basin these results revealed the uncertainties in the current gridded precipitation products on the qtp reducing the uncertainties of precipitation input through combining different sources of measurements including ground observations remote sensing and climate model simulation is a goal in future work 6 conclusion based on the gbehm model we explored the changes in cryosphere hydrological processes in the qinghai lake basin in the period from 1971 to 2015 through model simulation the temporal and spatial changes in frozen soil and catchment water balance were quantified and the impacts of frozen soil change on the catchment hydrology were investigated the following conclusions are derived based on our results 1 the gbehm model has acceptable skill in simulating the daily river discharge long term annual runoff change and freeze thaw processes in the qinghai lake basin 2 insights of the results of the model simulation show that the area of permafrost decreased from 1971 to 2015 by approximately 13 and permafrost degradation mainly occurred in the regions with elevations from 3600 to 4200 m the maximum frozen depth averaged in the seasonally frozen ground decreased significantly by 0 06 m 10a and the active layer thickness averaged in the permafrost had a significant increasing trend of 0 02 m 10a 3 the decadal variation in water balance elements in the qinghai lake basin shows that precipitation evaporation and runoff all showed increasing trends in the period from 1971 to 2015 the increase in the runoff supplied by glaciers and snowmelt was quite limited suggesting that runoff was mainly influenced by precipitation and frozen soil change 4 the results of the model simulation suggest that permafrost degradation into seasonally frozen ground increased the storage of liquid water in soil and reduced the soil ice storage frozen soil degradation increased the runoff in the freezing season and altered the monthly flow regime and it had a negative effect on runoff in the thawing season and annual runoff this finding suggests that the increase in the annual runoff into the qinghai lake was primarily resulted from the increased precipitation these findings highlight the complex response of hydrological processes to spatial and temporal changes in frozen soil our results help decision makers and hydrology researchers better understand the hydrological changes under climate change in cold regions and

8076,study region the qinghai lake basin qinghai tibetan plateau the qinghai lake is the largest inland saltwater lake in china study focus significant increase in runoff into the qinghai lake has been reported however the relationship between frozen soil changes and runoff remains poorly understood this study investigated the temporal and spatial variations in frozen soil and associate effects on streamflow and soil moisture in the study region by a distributed eco hydrological model new hydrological insights the results illustrate that the coverage of permafrost decreased by about 13 from 1971 to 2015 and permafrost degradation mainly occurred in the elevation interval of 3600 4200 m the maximum frozen depth averaged in the seasonally frozen ground significantly decreased by 0 06 m 10a while the active layer thickness averaged in the permafrost enhanced by 0 02 m 10a permafrost degradation caused enhanced soil liquid water storage and an increase in freezing season runoff the increase in runoff in the thawing season was dominated by changes in precipitation the results suggest that frozen soil degradation altered the seasonal flow regime leading to lags in the monthly runoff peak and it increased the base flow and reduced the thawing season runoff this offset of the competing impacts of frozen soil changes in different seasons led to a negative effect on annual runoff this study provides new understandings of cryospheric hydrological responses to climate change keywords the qinghai lake basin frozen soil change climate change runoff distributed hydrological model 1 introduction frozen soil is defined as soil and rock containing ice at or below 0 c it has an essential influence on land atmosphere interactions terrestrial ecosystems and hydrological cycles in the earth s land system cao et al 2018 gao et al 2021 yang et al 2019 depending on the duration of the frozen state frozen soil can be classified as the seasonally frozen ground and permafrost seasonally frozen ground is ground that freezes and thaws during the year evans and ge 2017 permafrost is ground that maintains at or below 0 c for at least two continuous years washburn 1973 woo 2012 triggered by climate warming changes in frozen soil particularly the degradation of permafrost have been extensively confirmed biskaborn et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 frozen soil degradation includes the thickening of the active layer of permafrost walvoord and kurylyk 2016 thinning of the frozen depth of the seasonally frozen ground huang and zhou 2012 and degradation from permafrost to seasonally frozen ground jin et al 2011 cao et al 2021 frozen soil degradation has significantly changed the hydrological processes in cold regions liljedahl et al 2016 it can greatly influence the hydrogeologic connectivity and water flow pathways lamontagne halle et al 2018 which alter the water resource supply for headwater catchments in cold regions and their downstream areas woo et al 2008 therefore investigating the hydrological impact of frozen soil changes has received rapidly increasing attention worldwide jin et al 2021 the qinghai tibetan plateau qtp is called the asian water tower immerzeel et al 2010 and permafrost covers more than 40 of the qtp cheng et al 2019 affected by global warming permafrost on the plateau is getting warmer and thinner wu et al 2010 luo et al 2018 and previous studies suggested that the areas of permafrost degraded from about 177 104 km2 in 1980 150 104 km2 in 2010 guo and wang 2013 previous studies suggested that the permafrost degradation has caused significant changes in alpine hydrology on the plateau chen et al 2018 kong and wang 2017 wang et al 2018 shi et al 2020 thus studies of permafrost change and its hydrological impact have extensive scientific significance on the qtp however the relationships between frozen soil degradation and the hydrological changes exhibit large differences at different temporal and spatial scales and how frozen soil changes influence the hydrological cycles and streamflow in the headwater catchments over the qtp remains difficult to quantify and needs a comprehensive study zhao et al 2020 due to the cold environment and high elevations field work is difficult on the qtp and observations usually can only identify changes at the plot scale or within a small experimental catchment therefore some hydrological models coupled with frozen soil processes have been developed or applied to analyze the changes in the hydrological processes in the alpine catchments over the qtp for example cuo et al 2015 studied the impact of frozen soil changes on surface hydrology on the qtp using the frozen soil coupled variable infiltration capacity vic model they mainly focused on the trends in soil temperature and soil moisture at multiple stations and their impact on streamflow in the source area of the yellow river sayr zheng et al 2018 analyzed the effect of the soil freezing thawing cycle on the streamflow based on the noah land surface model simulation sun et al 2020 quantified the responses of the main hydrological elements to permafrost degradation using the water balance simulation model wasim in the sayr wang et al 2009a 2009b developed the water and energy budget based distributed hydrological model web dhm and subsequently implemented a snow and frozen soil module into this model wang et al 2017 this improved model was recently employed to simulate the frozen soil changes at typical sites in the sayr song et al 2020 there are over 32 000 lakes on the qtp accounting for about half of the total area of china s lakes zhang et al 2014 some hydrological models have also been applied to analyze the changes in the hydrological processes over the lake basins on the qtp the web dhm was utilized to estimate the changes in water balance in the lake selin co basin and nam co basin zhou et al 2015 2016 zhong et al 2020 the vic model was applied to calculate the contribution of glacier runoff in the selin co lake storage changes tong et al 2016 the j2000g model was employed in four lake basins on the southern central qtp to compare the differences in the variations of water balance biskop et al 2016 however frozen soil was not studied in detail in these researches on lake basins due to the large heterogeneity in topography and significant differences in the temporal trends in climatology the hydrological response to frozen soil change has great spatial and temporal variations which have not been sufficiently investigated in previous studies it is difficult to distinguish the effect of frozen soil degradation from other factors and conflicting findings were reported with negative effect wang et al 2018 shi et al 2020 and positive effect walvoord et al 2012 sun et al 2020 of frozen soil degradation on annual runoff therefore the influence of frozen soil changes on hydrological processes at the catchment scale is still not fully understood the qinghai lake basin is located on the northeastern region of the qtp which is an important barrier to maintaining the ecological security in the qtp zhang et al 2013 all the rivers in this basin flow into the qinghai lake which is the largest saline lake in china su et al 2020 during the past 50 years the water level of this lake decreased in the period of 1971 2004 and it started to rise since 2005 previous studies found that the trend of the runoff into the lake was basically consistent with the changes in the water level of the lake which increased from 2005 dong et al 2018 the increase in runoff into the lake has been considered as the major cause of the increase in the water level of this lake du et al 2020 and there are debates about why runoff has increased in the qinghai lake basin li et al 2020 fan et al 2021 which has experienced large changes in precipitation and melting of continuous permafrost zhou et al 2000 therefore the attribution of the runoff changes in this basin remains unclear previous studies have investigated the changes in river flow in the qinghai lake basin using hydrological models shu et al 2008 revealed the annual runoff changes in the qinghai lake basin based on the swat model simulation and evaluated the effect of climate and vegetation cover change on runoff long et al 2016 constructed a distributed physically based hydrological model for the qinghai lake basin and simulated the streamflow changes ma et al 2018 estimated the water balance of the qinghai lake basin by combining the field observations and hydrological modeling approach however the soil freeze thaw process was lacking in these modeling studies and the influence of the cryosphere on the hydrological process was not well understood therefore how the spatial and temporal variations of frozen soil affect the hydrological processes in the qinghai lake basin still needs to be further studied in recent years the gbehm model geomorphology based eco hydrological model was developed for simulating the effect of climate change on the catchment hydrology in alpine regions yang et al 2015 gao et al 2016 2018 the gbehm fully couples the hydrological processes and the cryospheric processes and it has been successfully applied to study the hydrological changes in cryosphere watersheds on the qtp including the source area of the yangtze river the yellow river and the heihe river table 1 therefore based on the gbehm model the objective of this study is to 1 investigate the temporal and spatial changes in frozen soil in the qinghai lake basin from 1971 to 2015 2 analyze the changes in the water balance in the qinghai lake basin and 3 quantify the response of runoff and soil moisture to frozen soil degradation from 1971 to 2015 2 study area and data the qinghai lake basin locates in the northeastern part of the qtp fig 1 within 97 50 e 101 20 e and 36 15 n 38 20 n the terrain of the qinghai lake basin decreases in elevation from the northwest to the southeast and the average altitude is approximately 4000 m the annual air temperature in this basin ranges from 1 1 4 0 c and the average annual precipitation is about 363 mm yi et al 2010 in this basin approximately 40 rivers merge into the qinghai lake and five major rivers in the northwestern part account for 83 of the total runoff into the lake permafrost covers a large fraction of the basin and it mainly locates in the northwestern part at high elevations and seasonally frozen ground covers the regions at low elevations each of these two types of frozen soil accounts for approximately 50 of the total area of the qinghai lake basin zou et al 2017 the depth of the lower boundary of the permafrost in this basin is estimated to vary in the range of 2 50 m using empirical formulas yan 2020 the topography data used in this study was the dem provided by the srtm product jarvis et al 2008 at 90 m spatial resolution the distribution

storage volume of glaciers were provided by the glacier survey of china wu and li 2004 the vegetation types were reclassified into 10 typologies in the study basin fig 2 fig 2 shows that glaciers are mainly located in the headwater regions with an area of 35 96 km2 which covers 0 12 of the whole basin area the alpine steppe is primarily found in the downstream region around the lake and the alpine meadow is the main vegetation type in the study basin the leaf area index lai and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fpar provided by the gimms data zhu et al 2013 were used to represent

dai et al 2013 and were used for the model simulation meteorological observations at national stations including the daily air temperature wind speed sunshine hours and relative humidity were available during period of 1971 2015 from the china meteorological administration cma http cdc cma gov cn these meteorological data were interpolated into a 1 5 km grid system by the distance and direction weighting method to generate the atmospheric forcing of the hydrological model and elevation dependent gradient of the air temperature based on the estimations by previous researches in the study basin li et al 2013 wang 2014 ma et al 2019 was considered in the interpolation the gridded daily precipitation data derived from the cgdpa china gauge based daily precipitation analysis product developed by shen and xiong 2016 which was interpolated by station observed data records were also applied as the forcing of the model simulation the gridded precipitation data of cmfd china meteorological forcing data provided by yang et al 2010 and he and yang 2020 were also collected the daily flow discharge data during the period of 1981 1984 and 2006 2014 and the annual river discharge in the period of 1971 2015 observed at the buhahekou station were collected from the hydrology and water resources bureau of the qinghai province china the drainage basin area of the buhahekou station is 14 337 km2 which represents approximately 55 of the whole area of the study basin the monthly river discharge data in the period of 2011 2014 observed at the gangcha station

amsterdam model evaporation product with a spatial resolution of 0 25 martens et al 2017 in the period of 2001 2015 was used to validate the model simulated evaporation 3 method the gbehm was used to simulate the changes in hydrological process of the qinghai lake basin and we used a 1 5 1 5 km grid system to discretely delineate the whole basin a series of hillslopes and valleys was identified within each grid yang et al 2015 gao et al 2016 the study basin was divided into 295 subcatchments and a number of flow intervals alongside the major river channel of each subcatchment were identified in a flow interval a series of hillslopes were symmetrically distributed along both sides of the river and the hillslope was the basic unit for the model simulation yang et al 1998 the slope gradient slope length and aspect of each hillslope unit were calculated by the dem data with 90 m resolution hydrological processes including surface runoff generation infiltration evapotranspiration snowmelt soil water movement and heat transfer were calculated on the hillslope unit yang et al 2002 2015 the soil freeze thaw process is solved based on the soil water heat coupling balance method and the soil water balance is calculated using the one dimensional richards equation celia et al 1990 considering the convective heat associated with soil heat conduction the heat of phase change and liquid water movement the energy budget equation is presented as follows flerchinger and saxton 1989 1 c s t t œÅ i l i Œ∏ i t z Œª s t z œÅ l c l q l t z 0 where c s is the specific heat capacity of the

calculates the amount of glacier melt through estimating the net heat absorbed by the glacier gbehm used a multilayer snow cover model and the snow albedo was calculated by estimating the solar radiation transfer in the snow layers based on the snicar snow ice and aerosol radiative module toon et al 1989 a mass and energy balance method is used to simulate the snowmelt process jordan 1991 bartelt and lehning 2002 the surface runoff is determined using the kinematic wave method and the flow between the river water and the unconfined aquifer is calculated by darcy s law the actual evaporation is calculated using the method developed by sellers et al 1996 the details for the gbehm model description is available in gao et al 2016 2018 yang et al 2015 and li et al 2019 we used a time step of 1 h to run the model and the hydrological processes from 1971 to 2015 in the study basin were simulated in addition to this normal run we also simulated runoff in the following scenarios the wo fg scenario scenario without frozen soil the only warming scenario and the only wetting scenario with the absence of frozen soil the phase transformation of liquid and solid in soil water was not taken into account in the wo fg scenario therefore soil was not freeze thawed and the calculation of other processes in this scenario were the same as that in normal run this scenario is designed to clarify the influence of frozen soil degradation on streamflow changes in the only warming scenario the precipitation input in 1971 was repeated every year in the study period so the inter annual trend in precipitation was removed while the other meteorological input were the same as that in the normal run in the only wetting scenario the air temperature input in 1971 was repeated every year in the study period so the warming trend in air temperature was removed while the other meteorological input were also the same as that in the normal run the purpose of these two scenarios was to assess the impact of increased precipitation and air temperature on hydrological processes 4 results 4 1 model validation to calibrate and validate the model the daily river discharge measured at the buhahekou hydrological station was used the observed ground temperature at the gangcha meteorological station was also used to validate the model simulation the major calibrated model parameters are the maximum surface storage land surface roughness the coefficient of groundwater permeability and soil reflectance to visible light and near infrared radiation table s1 the period of 1981 1984 was used for model calibration based on the period of available daily river discharge data and the validation period was 2011 2014 fig 3 shows the comparison between the simulated and measured daily river flow at the buhahekou station the simulated daily river discharge agreed well with the observations at this station in the calibration period the nse was 0 66 and the re was 2 80 fig 3 a in the validation period the nse was 0 64 and the re was 6 61 fig 3 b fig s1 shows the comparison between the simulated and observed monthly river discharge at the gangcha station in the validation period the nse of the model simulated monthly river discharge was 0 73 suggesting an acceptable accuracy these results indicate that the gbehm can well simulate the streamflow in the study basin fig 4 shows the comparison of model simulated monthly evaporation and the gleam evaporation in the period of 2001 2015 the gbehm showed acceptable accuracy in simulating evaporation with rmse of 2 37 mm and r2 of 0 89 in the period of 2001 2015 fig 5 compares the model simulated and observed daily ground temperatures at the gangcha station it can be seen from the figure that the variations in the simulated ground temperature agreed well with the observations from 2004 2011 the simulated maximum frozen depth was approximately 1 5 m which was close to the observations of 1 6 m the simulated ground temperature had a decreasing tendency of rmses as soil depth increased the rmses at depths lower than 20 cm were approximately 3 0 c and the rmse decreased to 1 9 c at a depth of 40 cm and 1 6 c at 80 cm the rmses at the 160 cm and 320 cm were approximately 1 3 c these results indicate that the model performance in simulating the soil freeze thaw process was acceptable 4 2 spatial and temporal changes in frozen soil the soil freeze began in early november in the qinghai lake basin and the soil thaw started in the middle of april as reported in previous studies li et al 2018 zhang and li 2018 therefore we designate the year into two seasons a freezing season from november to march and a thawing season from april to october fig 6 displays the changes of the simulated basin averaged seasonal ground temperature it can be seen from the figure that the ground temperature increased in both the two seasons in the freezing season the mean annual ground temperature of the deep layer 240 290 cm was 1 35 c which was approximately 5 c higher than that of the shallow layer 0 50 cm fig 6 a in the thawing season the opposite was found fig 6 b and the shallow layer had a mean annual ground temperature which was approximately 5 c higher than the deep layer in the freezing season the shallow soil layer had an increasing trend in the basin averaged ground temperature 0 39 c 10a which was greater than that in the thawing season 0 18 c 10a while in the deeper layer the increasing trend in the ground temperature 0 35 c 10a in the thawing season was slightly larger than that in the freezing season 0 32 c 10a fig 7 shows the changes in the distribution of permafrost during the periods of 1971 1980 and 2001 2015 the coverage of permafrost was 1 27 104 km2 in the period of 1971 1980 and it shrunk to 1 10 104 km2 in the period of 2001 2015 with a reduction of 1700 km2 13 3 the degradation of permafrost primarily occurred in the regions with elevations between 3600 m and 4200 m fig 7 c and d changes in the area of permafrost in the period from 1971 to 2015 were generally identical to the rising air temperature fig 8 a fig 8 b illustrates the changes in the active layer thickness of permafrost and the maximum frozen depth of the seasonally frozen ground in the qinghai lake basin in the period from 1971 to 2015 the basin averaged active layer thickness of permafrost exhibited a significantly increasing trend p 0 005 at a rate of 0 02 m 10a the maximum frozen depth averaged in the seasonally frozen ground had a remarkable decreasing rate of 0 06 m 10a p 0 001 indicating a greater change in magnitude than the active layer thickness of permafrost 4 3 changes in the water balance the changes in the water balance in the qinghai lake basin are shown in fig 9 and table 2 the basin averaged mean annual precipitation evaporation and runoff in the period from 1971 to 2015 were 403 2 mm 363 5 mm and 49 5 mm respectively fig 9 shows the spatial variation in precipitation evaporation and runoff in the period from 1971 to 1980 and the period from 2001 to 2015 the spatial changes in annual evaporation and runoff were generally consistent with those in precipitation precipitation and runoff were mainly concentrated in the northwestern part of the basin at high elevations in this region the maximum annual precipitation was over 600 mm and the maximum annual runoff was over 200 mm this finding indicates that the areas with high elevations are the main source regions for runoff generation the annual precipitation evaporation and runoff had decadal variations and all reached their maximum values in the period from 2001 2015 the snowmelt and glacial runoff contributed a small fraction to the annual runoff and little increase in them during the period of 1971 2015 was found this finding indicates that increases in snowmelt and glacier runoff were not the dominant drivers of the increase in runoff in the study basin fig 10 compares the simulated annual runoff and observations at the buhahekou hydrological station from 1971 to 2015 and the inter annual variations in the glacier and snowmelt runoff the variation in simulated annual runoff agrees well with the observations r 2 0 82 the observed annual runoff had a significant increasing trend which was also captured by the model simulation this result also illustrates that gbehm had acceptable skill in simulating the runoff changes in the study basin the variations of glacier and snowmelt runoff were generally the same as annual total runoff and no significant trend was found the multi year average of glacier and snowmelt runoff was 10 8 mm this result is consistent with the findings in previous studies that glaciers and snowmelt provided quite limited runoff in the study basin jin et al 2013 wang et al 2016 4 4 effects of frozen soil change on soil moisture and runoff 4 4 1 effect of frozen soil change on soil moisture the alterations in the basin averaged value of annual soil liquid water 0 3 m and soil ice 0 3 m in the period from 1971 to 2015 are displayed in fig 11 the soil liquid water exhibited a remarkable increasing tendency and the ice content 0 3 m exhibited an evident decrease triggered by the degradation of frozen soil fig 12 illustrates the changes in the spatially averaged soil liquid water content from 1971 to 2015 at the elevation interval of 3200 3600 m which was mainly seasonally frozen ground and the regions with elevations ranging from 3600 to 4200 m where permafrost degradation mainly occurred in the low elevations of 3200 3600 m covered by seasonally frozen ground reduction of frozen depth caused a slightly increase in the liquid soil moisture fig 12 a at regions with elevations between 3600 and 4200 m the transition from permafrost to seasonally frozen ground after 2000 led to a dramatic increase in soil liquid water content in deep soils this result suggests that the effect of frozen soil changes on hydrological processes has spatial characteristics the degradation of permafrost into seasonally frozen ground tended to have a larger impact on soil moisture than the changes in seasonally frozen ground fig s2 compares the regime of soil liquid water content and soil ice with precipitation at monthly scale in the period from 1971 to 1980 period 1 and the period from 2001 2015 period 2 in the qinghai lake basin as seen from the figure the soil liquid water and soil ice have an annual cycle the simulated soil ice began to melt in march and it gradually melted during april september the soil liquid water reached its peak around september as soil ice melted the pattern of soil liquid water was opposite that of soil ice and soil ice started to increase in october and peaked in winter december to february from period 1 to period 2 soil liquid water increased and soil ice decreased with little change in their monthly patterns 4 4 2 effect of frozen soil change on runoff the variations in annual runoff and precipitation with elevation in the period of 1971 1980 and the period of 2001 2015 are shown in fig 13 generally runoff and precipitation in the study basin increased with increasing elevation runoff and precipitation both reached their maximum values at elevations of 4500 4600 m precipitation and runoff increased from 1971 to 1980 2001 2015 however the seasonal differences in the runoff changes were evident from the period of 1971 1980 to the period of 2001 2015 the increase in the runoff in the thawing season and annual runoff were generally consistent with the enhanced precipitation on the contrary the largest runoff changes in the freezing season was found in the regions with elevations of 3600 4200 where the frozen soil types changed from permafrost to the seasonally frozen ground this result indicates that permafrost degradation dominated the runoff increase during the freezing season and the permafrost degradation exerted greater effect on runoff than the seasonally frozen ground changes the increased runoff during the thawing season seemed mainly caused by the increase in precipitation streamflow in the freezing season was mainly generated by the interflow released from deep soils layers permafrost degradation leads to an increase in the infiltration and melting of soil ice which enhances deep soil liquid water storage and increases the soil hydraulic conductivity this change has a positive effect on the interflow generation from deep soil layers for the purpose of further investigating the implication of frozen soil on runoff in the thawing season and annual runoff we compared the runoff simulated in the normal run and three scenarios wo fg only warming and only wetting fig 14 displays the comparison of the annual and seasonal runoff simulated in the normal run and the three scenarios the annual runoff simulated in the only warming scenario showed no significant tendency because the increasing trend in annual precipitation was removed while the simulated annual runoff in the other three cases were increasing fig 14 a this finding suggests that the increasing in annual runoff in the study basin was mainly caused by enhanced precipitation without the air temperature warming the simulated annual runoff in the only wetting scenario was higher than that in the normal run this result indicates that the warming trend in air temperature had a negative effect on annual runoff fig 14 b presents the multi year average annual and seasonal runoff the multi year average annual runoff in the wo fg scenario was 14 9 mm lower than that in the normal run this result confirms that frozen soil degradation reduced the annual runoff the freezing season runoff simulated in the wo fg scenario was 9 0 mm which was larger than that in the normal run 4 3 mm in the thawing season the runoff in the wo fg scenario 36 4 mm was lower than that in the normal run 51 1 mm these results were consistent with the findings revealed in fig 13 the impact of frozen soil change on the annual runoff was determined by the offset of its negative effect on the thawing season runoff and the positive effect on freezing season runoff in the only warming scenario without the increasing trend of precipitation frozen soil degradation was still retained due to the warming trend in air temperature in this scenario runoff in the freezing season was also larger than that in the normal run and runoff in the thawing season was lower than that in the normal run these results also suggest that frozen soil degradation increased the runoff in the freezing season and reduced the runoff in the thawing season fig 15 shows that there is an annual anticlockwise hysteresis loop in the results of simulation in the normal run and the wo fg scenario the runoff enhanced from march to july and as precipitation decreased during the non flood season it declined from september to december however the size of the hysteresis loop in the wo fg scenario was larger than that in the normal run this is because that runoff increased during the freezing season and decreased during the thawing season compared with the normal run as mentioned above fig 16 shows the average monthly precipitation simulated runoff soil liquid moisture and soil ice content in the qinghai lake basin in the period from 1971 to 2015 the variation in monthly runoff in the normal run was consistent with that in precipitation in the wo fg scenario the runoff peak had a one month delay compared with that in the normal run the reason for this result is that the existence of ice in the frozen soil forms an impermeable layer which reduces infiltration in the wo fg scenario with the absence of frozen soil more precipitation infiltrates into the deep soil which reduces the direct response of surface and shallow lateral runoff to precipitation and therefore causes a lag in the monthly runoff peak therefore the soil freeze thaw process has an essential effect on the monthly runoff regime in the qinghai lake basin and the changes in frozen soil significantly influence the precipitation runoff hysteresis loops as shown in fig 15 fig s3 shows the daily hydrograph at the buhahekou station in 2011 in the normal run and in the wo fg scenario the flood peak in the wo fg scenario is lower than that in the normal run these results suggest that frozen soil degradation has a substantial effect on the flow regime which may alter seasonal pattern of the runoff leading to a decrease in the flood peak and an increase in the base flow 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with previous similar studies 5 1 1 frozen soil simulation yuan 2016 analyzed the changes in the averaged annual maximum frozen depth obtained by observation in the last 30 years 1981 2014 at three sites one is the gongcha station and two stations are outside the basin they found that the maximum value of frozen depth was 188 cm in 1984 and that the minimum was 127 cm in 2006 this is basically consistent with the results simulated by the model in this study at the grid where the gangcha station located which estimated that the maximum and minimum values of the frozen depth occurred in 1984 153 cm and 2006 125 cm respectively in this study the area of permafrost in the period from 2001 to 2015 was estimated to be 1 10 104 km2 which is slightly lower than the widely used map proposed by zou et al 2017 the modis land surface temperature in the period of 2003 2012 was adopted in their work to map the distribution of permafrost on the whole qtp using the ttop temperature at the top of permafrost model and they estimated the area of permafrost in the qinghai lake basin to be 1 24 104 km2 our results differ from that of zou et al 2017 and this deviation may be related to the different models and data used in addition the study period of this research is longer than the study period of zou et al 2017 and degradation of permafrost has continued since 2012 therefore the results of the frozen soil simulation in our study are reasonable 5 1 2 effect of frozen soil change on hydrological processes our study shows that the changes in annual runoff varied with elevation which basically agrees with the results of zhang et al 2017 more over our results further distinguished different influences of frozen soil change on streamflow at the seasonal scale section 4 displays that the impact of permafrost degradation on streamflow had seasonal characteristics and it caused an increase in runoff in the cold season and decreased runoff in the thawing season this result basically agrees with the findings of sun et al 2020 in the sayr our results also suggested that the frozen soil degradation altered the monthly flow regime increased base flow and reduced the flood peak in summer fig 15 fig 16 and fig s3 these findings are consistent with those of gao et al 2018 in the upper heihe basin and those of niu et al 2016 in the sayr our results suggest that soil warming and frozen soil change had an effect of reducing the annual runoff which is similar with the conclusions of wang et al 2018 in the upper heihe river basin and those of shi et al 2020 in the source region of the yangtze river however this finding is different from the result of sun et al 2020 who found that the degradation of permafrost led to an increase in the annual discharge in most regions in the sayr by the wasim model simulation this deviation may be related to the unique characteristics of cryosphere hydrological cycles in the sayr which cause different offsets of the positive and negative impacts of frozen soil change on streamflow components between seasons the results of this study suggest that the changes in frozen soil enhanced the soil water content this finding is similar with that of jorgenson et al 2001 who found that permafrost degradation resulted in a substantial increase in soil moisture in central alaska this result is also consistent with the findings of gao et al 2018 in the upper heihe basin bordering the north of the study basin and those of cuo et al 2015 at some stations on the eastern qtp however this result is different from the findings of zhang et al 2019 who argued that permafrost degradation reduced soil moisture in the active layer based on a coupled model simulation zhang et al 2016 at one site in the source region of the yangtze river the possible reason of such difference may be that zhang et al 2019 focused on the thaw depth changes at only one site at which soil moisture decreased mainly due to the increase in evaporation in this study at the basin scale changes in soil moisture were dominated by the melting of soil ice associated with the permafrost degradation to the seasonally frozen ground the results of this study were also different from those of sun et al 2020 who argued that permafrost degradation resulted in soil moisture to decline in the mountain regions in the sayr by model simulation the difference between our results and those of sun et al 2020 may be relevant to the different hydrogeological conditions between the sayr and the qinghai lake basin in addition in the sayr sun et al 2020 found that the liquid soil moisture decreased due to enhanced groundwater recharge whereas in this study we found a positive impact of soil ice melting on the liquid soil moisture which was not considered in the work of sun et al 2020 these results highlight the complex competing effect of frozen soil degradation on liquid soil moisture including the positive effect of ground ice melting and the negative effect of water loss by increased evaporation and groundwater recharge on the other hand the effects of frozen soil degradation on soil water content are also affected by different seasons and soil depths cuo et al 2015 therefore the complex mechanism of frozen soil degradation on soil moisture in the qtp still needs further investigation in future works 5 2 uncertainties and limitations there are uncertainties in the numerical simulation of the gbehm model in our study including uncertainties in the meteorological inputs vegetation and soil parameters in particular the uncertainties in the precipitation input may influence the accuracy of our results in the qinghai lake basin compared to the land ground the large heat flux of the lake will cause changes in the wind temperature humidity and precipitation around the lake this phenomenon is called the lake effect su et al 2020 this effect may have a certain influence on the surrounding climate and is not fully considered in the current precipitation datasets applied in the qtp due to sparse distributions of the ground sites in the study basin we compared the results of this study with the simulations using precipitation from cmfd dataset as input see fig s4 tables s2 s3 the cmfd dataset has been widely used on the qtp he and yang 2020 zhou et al 2015 2016 zhong et al 2020 the results in this study by the cgdpa precipitation performed better than the simulations by the cmfd precipitation except in a few years such as 2010 in which the cgdpa precipitation overestimated the flood season runoff fig s4 the nse of the simulated river discharge at the buhahekou station by cmfd precipitation in the period of 1981 1984 and 2011 2014 was 0 57 and 0 36 which was significantly lower than that of the simulations by cgdpa precipitation table s2 this result was related to a great underestimation of river discharges by the cmfd precipitation due to its unreasonable low values compared with the period of 1981 1984 the observed river discharge significantly increased in the period of 2011 2014 implying an evident increase in precipitation amount which was consistent with changes in the cgdpa precipitation however the cmfd precipitation in the period of 2011 2014 was close to that in the period of 1981 1984 which resulted in a significant underestimation of annual river discharge with re of 39 83 table s2 and table s3 this underestimation was more evident in flood years for example the observed annual river discharge at the buhahekou station in 2012 was 59 58 m3 s which was much larger than the observed average river discharge in the period of 2011 2014 40 35 m3 s implying a large precipitation amount in 2012 however the cmfd precipitation in 2012 was only 356 2 mm which was much lower than its mean value in 2011 2014 424 5 mm leading to an unreasonable low value of simulated river discharge table s3 these results suggest that the cgdpa precipitation is more reasonable and accurate than the cmfd precipitation therefore the cgdpa precipitation is more suitable for simulating the runoff in the qinghai lake basin these results revealed the uncertainties in the current gridded precipitation products on the qtp reducing the uncertainties of precipitation input through combining different sources of measurements including ground observations remote sensing and climate model simulation is a goal in future work 6 conclusion based on the gbehm model we explored the changes in cryosphere hydrological processes in the qinghai lake basin in the period from 1971 to 2015 through model simulation the temporal and spatial changes in frozen soil and catchment water balance were quantified and the impacts of frozen soil change on the catchment hydrology were investigated the following conclusions are derived based on our results 1 the gbehm model has acceptable skill in simulating the daily river discharge long term annual runoff change and freeze thaw processes in the qinghai lake basin 2 insights of the results of the model simulation show that the area of permafrost decreased from 1971 to 2015 by approximately 13 and permafrost degradation mainly occurred in the regions with elevations from 3600 to 4200 m the maximum frozen depth averaged in the seasonally frozen ground decreased significantly by 0 06 m 10a and the active layer thickness averaged in the permafrost had a significant increasing trend of 0 02 m 10a 3 the decadal variation in water balance elements in the qinghai lake basin shows that precipitation evaporation and runoff all showed increasing trends in the period from 1971 to 2015 the increase in the runoff supplied by glaciers and snowmelt was quite limited suggesting that runoff was mainly influenced by precipitation and frozen soil change 4 the results of the model simulation suggest that permafrost degradation into seasonally frozen ground increased the storage of liquid water in soil and reduced the soil ice storage frozen soil degradation increased the runoff in the freezing season and altered the monthly flow regime and it had a negative effect on runoff in the thawing season and annual runoff this finding suggests that the increase in the annual runoff into the qinghai lake was primarily resulted from the increased precipitation these findings highlight the complex response of hydrological processes to spatial and temporal changes in frozen soil our results help decision makers and hydrology researchers better understand the hydrological changes under climate change in cold regions and provide a valuable reference for water resources management on the qinghai tibetan plateau credit authorship contribution statement wang xinyu data curation software writing original draft gao bing

8077,study region fractured aquifers in benin have emerged in the past decades as a critical resource because of the increasing domestic water needs agriculture and livestock breeding hence this study was undertaken in the poorly gauged and complex basement aquifers beneath the 9th latitude study focus to aid water resources management and sustainability this study combined satellite remote sensing products with outputs from hydrological models and in situ measurement to assess the spatial and temporal patterns of water storage changes including groundwater the fractured aquifers hydrogeological regime is further analysed through monitoring wells series interpretation new hydrological insights for the region results show considerable inter annual variations in terrestrial water storage tws during the study period 2003 2019 two uptrend intervals characterized by wet hydrological seasons from 2006 to 2013 and 2016 2019 with respectively sen s slope values of 1 16 mm yr and 4 47 mm yr were observed however two downtrend intervals represented by dry hydrological seasons with sen s slopes of 1 01 mm yr 2003 2006 and 1 19 mm yr 2013 2016 were also observed the inter annual seasonality in land water storage components showed that unlike the 4 climatic seasons the hydrogeological regime is affected by 3 seasons each year the first dry season takes place from january to april may 29 1 17 7 mm yr followed by the wet season april may to october november 41 6 26 4 mm yr and the last dry period which is stronger november to december 53 7 31 6 mm yr soil moisture sm and canopy water content cw declined during the 2008 2016 period coinciding with decline in tree cover areas which dropped by 25 5 3086 7 sqkm further from 2007 to 2014 the four monitoring wells have seen the groundwater level increased by 1 44 m yr 2 0 m yr 3 2 m yr and 0 56 m yr for the affon zou okpara and couffo sub basins respectively the retrieved tws and water global assessment and prognosis groundwater storage watergap gws sub domains based on statistical decomposition was used to identify hidden patterns to improve knowledge on the climatic and hydrological conditions which affected land water storage moreover tws gws and sm lost water 51 57 and 47 of the time respectively during the period and the storage potential is lower for the aquifers compared to the unsaturated zone precipitation is recognized as a primary driver of gws r 0 69 Œ± 0 05 in the region and a change in gws is more likely to drive the cw and affect the vegetation greenness moreover the anthropogenic pressure exacerbates tree cover loss additionally the extra tree regressor performs best in the groundwater storage change gws prediction with a strong and positive pearson correlation coefficient of 0 92 the basement aquifers assessment using the aforementioned approach has potential to support large scale monitoring efforts for more reliable water resources management in the region keywords aquifers canopy water hydrology terrestrial water storage soil moisture groundwater 1 introduction water resources management be it surface or groundwater is critical for adequate response to climatic constraints and anthropogenic influence strong changes in global climate through reduced precipitation and rising temperature affect natural systems e g decreased groundwater recharge as well as discharge to streams leading to threats in global water resources usman et al 2021 blunden and arndt 2020 in developing countries each time the water budget balance tilts persistently towards dryness social crisis like famine waterborne diseases and poverty are likely e g agutu et al 2017 as the land water content is mainly controlled by groundwater occurrence blunden and arndt 2020 several studies have revealed the alarming anthropogenic and climate change pressure on aquifers and hydro ecological systems e g ndehedehe et al 2021 the basement area beneath the 9th latitude in benin republic west africa is one of such regions where water budget components have been influenced in various ways by these factors for example between 1975 and 2013 a rise in agricultural areas reached 27 1 of the total country area with an increase of 600 sq km per year was reported by lucas et al 2015 this land use land cover change over the last decades triggered water resource vulnerability in the area through habitat degradation and biodiversity loss typical aquifer system in this area is separated mainly in 3 levels from bottom to the top the fractured matrix the relatively high interstice porosity zone weathered and the unsaturated laterite in contact with the atmosphere in this basement discontinuous aquifers geometric and hydrodynamic assessment require improving understanding especially about the fractured and weathered zone as well as the upper unsaturated medium boukari 1982 the national wells database reveal that even at a local scale there are substantial changes in the wells characteristics related to the unfolded alteration process erosion intensity and prevailing climatic and hydrologic conditions the drinking water boreholes database represents the available knowledge of the aquifers despite the location and depth subjectivity monitoring wells network is not dense enough to capture the aquifers complex hydrodynamic properties which evolves according to geology geomorphology and the unfolding climatic conditions recommended equipment and a qualified team required for efficient wells monitoring are costly and time consuming for the national department the available wells time series data are short and not reliable for adequate analysis and prediction as it is challenging to maintain permanent qualified team for the task consistent efforts are made for drinking water supply but from hydrogeological perspective these wells characteristics do not depict accurately aquifers properties this happens because the wells flow generally depends on the community water need rather than the aquifer s capacity monitoring the changes in water table is required for perennial and sustainable wells discharge in the future boukari 2002 the national piezometer network rpn was in place since 1989 and has recently reached 107 piezometers omidelta 2020 in basement areas the aquifers are discontinuous unlike in sedimentary areas therefore water table level maps are less reliable for this reason and equipment high cost problem the rpn past projects were executed mainly in sedimentary basins but for groundwater recharge and depletion gwr d monitoring purpose which is critical for water resources renewal observation there is a serious need to cover poorly gauged fractured aquifers cf livre bleu b√©nin 2009 therefore the temporal variation in the earth s surface mass retrieved from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and grace follow on grace fo and transformed into equivalent water thickness e g ferreira et al 2020 ndehedehe et al 2020 zheng et al 2019 offers for now the most accurate and reliable uniform solution to fill both the temporal and spatial gap hindering aquifers storage change understanding groundwater fluxes and storages estimated from inverted gravity observations to tws could significantly improve and complete the rpn moreover drinking water supply in riparian communities can be improved using the water table level estimation through data assimilation methods the combination of remote sensing and outputs from hydrological models provides an innovative approach to investigating changes in hydrological stores surface water or groundwater in large catchments with nasa s recent improvement in global land data assimilation system gldas land surface models lsms the uncertainty around groundwater abstraction impacts in emerging economies could become less blurred additionally the long term trends in gwr d state due to the lack of measurements and non uniform estimation technique across large areas could be mitigated further annual tws changes are recognized to be an acceptable indicator for groundwater storage changes the latter being insufficiently observed in most of the world blunden and arndt 2020 li et al 2015 across africa several grace hydrological studies have been undertaken in lake victoria getirana et al 2020 sub sahara africa mcnally

combined grace and lsms products to improve knowledge on the spatial and temporal variability in tws terrestrial water storage including water storage change reservoirs water level fluctuations drought and flood impacts on freshwater ecosystems some areas in west africa displayed a significant positive trend in tws variations but the inconsistency with rainfall soil moisture and tws was attributed to land surface conditions and complex hydrological processes ndehedehe et al 2018a 2018b this evidence is applicable in hard rock areas at the local scale as the characteristics of groundwater wells can fluctuate abruptly from one site to a relatively nearer one in tws budget evaluation across the globe rodell et al 2018 estimated an average positive trend of 24 1 2 1 gt yr 1 with a slower downtrend in the precipitation 0 12 0 01 mm yr 1 for west africa countries between latitudes 5¬∫n and 15¬∫n include this study area have seen a leading annual amplitude in the long term

groundwater recharge hector et al 2014 2013 in addition to the impacts of climate on gwr in the hard rock region geological features such as fractures and alterations significantly delineate groundwater potential oussou et al 2019 furthermore ali and lebel 2009 highlights the scale matter bearing upon the water resources evaluation over the sahel where a significantly dry season is recognized in 2006 across the whole area while there is a significantly wet area of 15 the outcome of a scientific community initiative recently highlighted 23 unsolved problems in hydrology which in its 4th point specifies the need to assess the land cover change and soil disturbances impacts on water and energy fluxes at the land surface and on the resulting groundwater recharge bl√∂schl et al 2019 the unproductive wells rate across the whole country basement especially beneath the 9th latitude remain a real concern and requires a thorough understanding of the hydrological systems and

datasets depending on how accurate it represents the corresponding hydrological layer in the region the updated national topographic maps provided by institut g√©ographique national ign 2017 give an exhaustive list of the surface water features the largest lake surface in the basement area beneath the 9th latitude is less than 4 sq km the combination of all surface water in the area is assumed to be negligible compared to other tws components cancelling the sw quantity which is related to surface water the gldas derived products temporal trend are processed using the seasonal decomposition

is applied to explore the hidden temporal variabilities embedded in the gldas tws components ndehedehe et al 2016b as explained in trauth 2006 the visualization of high dimensional data sets requires the reduction of dimensionality which is chosen in this case to decompose the tws components into principal components pcs the principal components decomposition is formulated as follow eq 8 8 y 1 a 11 x 1 a 12 x 2 a 1 p x p y 1 a 21 x 1 a 22 x 2 a 2 p x p y n a n 1 x 1 a n 2 x 2 a np x p where y 1 y 2 y n stands for the principal components x 1 x 2 x p for the variables and a 11 a 12 a 1 p a n 1 a n 2 a np are the loadings also known as principal component scores or the eigenvectors the loadings express each variable influence on the pc and are derived from the data sets covariance or

effects and more importantly due to human groundwater abstraction has assessed based on different data source like global model products satellite images and well observations rodell et al 2009 mcguire 2011 schuh 2013 d√∂ll et al 2014 schmied et al 2016 herbert and d√∂ll 2019 ferreira et al 2020 ndehedehe et al 2018a 2018b in this case the gwr d temporal change is evaluated computing the first order differencing on the data sets which is a simple de trend technic and the storage mode quantile function of storage and storage deficit the first order differencing eq 9 is generated by calculating the difference between the groundwater storage at t 1 and t formulated as followed 9 with x t Œ≤ 0 Œ≤ 1 t Œµ t 9 z t x t 1 x t Œ≤ 1 Œµ t 1 Œµ t where z t dgws dt and Œµ t is the noise 3 2 4 2 storage mode the duration curve cf eq 10 12 also represented by quantile function of storage ferreira et al 2020 is computed for this basement as there have been a persistent issue of drinking water wells dryness expressed by groundwater depletion and flow decrease overtime awange et al 2014 have applied this method to tws data sets which is basically the probability of exceedance of a storage value helsel and hirsch 2002 10 p m n 1 100 m the ranked position in the listing and n the number of months the slope of the quantile function of storage s qfs is negative and calculated between the storage 33rd s 33 and 66th s 66 percentiles using the expression below 11 s qfs s 33 s 66 66 33 as mentioned above the amplitude in the tws components can make wells go through a periodic fluctuation thus the monthly percentage water storage deficit known as storage deficit is also computed to provide the national water department and other water users with groundwater change seasons in the study area which is critical for drinking water wells monitoring the equation is expressed as follow narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 ferreira et al 2020 12 sd s i median s j max s j min s j 100

index proposed by nigatu et al 2021 and thomas et al 2017 the grace terrestrial water storage which counts for the liquid water equivalent thickness is subtracted from the study area mean to obtain the terrestrial water storage deviation tsd the gtdi cf eq 13 is the normalized net deviation which is calculated by subtracting the tsd from its mean tsd and dividing the result by the standard

standard deviation of 7 04 mm and the values oscillates between 0 mm and 85 3 mm after adjustment to different types of distribution law the best fit is given by weibull distribution law and its parameters alpha Œ± and beta Œ≤ are respectively 3 3 and 0 6 fig 3b reveals a persistent increase in the evapotranspiration signal extending from 2003 to 2015 which is remarkable in the land cover land use change during that period fig 5 in respond to this constraint the canopy water has dropped from 2008 to 2016 fig 3c confirming what can be interpreted as a climatic stress due to whether

parameters distribution law with alpha 123 4 and beta 1 4 table 2 the tws temporal pattern during the study period shows two uptrends and two downtrends it starts with a downtrend which lasts three years 2003 2006 and the second downtrend occurred from 2013 to 2016 with a sen s slope values eq 7 which are respectively 1 01 mm yr and 1 19 mm yr the first downside performance in the tws is noticed in each component even in the precipitation and evapotranspiration series the second downtrend matches the gws trend in the same period and reflects an already existing downtrend 2008 2016 in both the soil moisture 0 19 mm yr and canopy water content 0 0001 mm yr but corresponds to an uptrend in the evapotranspiration fig 3b and d the uptrend periods last respectively seven years 2006 2013 depicting an overall wet period characterized by a sen s slope value of 1 16 mm yr and four years 2016 2019 with a sen s slope of 4 47 mm yr table 2 the study period last four years signals 2016 2019 have been confirmed in each dataset to be a strong and positive uptrend with a rise in the gws 3 27 mm yr sm 0 93 mm yr cw 0 0005 mm yr and obviously in the precipitation 0 014 mm yr following almost the same temporal pattern the groundwater storage gws fluctuates from 171 2 303 8 mm and fits the two parameters weibull distribution law with Œ± and Œ≤ which are 100 3 and 1 4 fig 3e further as the downtrend and uptrend periods match the tws ones the sen s slope values of the gws are respectively for the two downtrends 1 11 mm yr and 1 31 mm yr and for the uptrends 1 07 mm yr and 3 27 mm yr fig 4 shows the descriptive statistic of the inner annual change trends of the tws components which count for the total land water storage eq 10 within each year the storage change pattern exhibits two downtrend periods and one uptrend the first tipping point occurs between march and april for sm april and may for tws april and may for cw and may and june for gws these patterns coincide with the beginning of the rain season and reveal the order in which the land water storage progressively occurs in the area a saturated soil triggers plants activity which already affect the overall tws trend before the gws aquifers respond to change the beginning of a new hydrogeological regime the second tipping point marks the end of the year single uptrend respectively from october to november for both the tws and the gws and from september to october for the sm and the cw therefore three seasons are noticed in the patterns a dry season starting from january to april with an average sen s slope of 29 1 17 7 mm yr a wet season from april to october 41 6 26 4 mm yr and a dry season from october to december 53 7 31 6 mm yr the noticeable evidence from these values is the fact that terrestrial water storage gain takes longer time during the year while loss requires less time which could be indicative of this aquifers fast groundwater discharge the lclu in this part of benin has been affected negatively by both climate change effects and anthropogenic influence oloukoi 2017 lucas et al 2015 zheng et al 2019 the soil moisture sm and canopy water cw patterns reveal the period starting from 2008 to 2016 to be dry season for both the unsaturated root zone and the vegetation layer fig 4c and d this persistent decline especially in the sm brought the sen s slope to 0 19 mm yr which reflects on the land cover vegetated areas the european space agency esa land cover based on the sentinel 2 and other satellite scenes have been collected and it turns out that there has been a remarkable decline in the vegetated areas thus the tree cover areas in this period have dropped by 25 5 3086 7 sqkm in other hand the cropland and shrubs areas have respectively increased significantly by 136 9 4847 7 sqkm and 69 6 1092 9 sqkm which is a proof of human action on land cover consequently on the canopy water content cw based on the aforementioned evidence the tws components water loss can trigger the plant activities resulting consequently in the greenness decrease 4 2 multivariate analysis based on the principal component analysis 4 2 1 grace tws the key hydrological drivers of the grace tws are assessed through the spatial and temporal variability decomposition using the principal component analysis pca the highest proportion of the total variability represented in the first mode tws 1 pc1 is explained by 98 1 fig 6 due to the coarse spatial resolution relative to the study area extent which is rather small the first orthogonal mode of tws variability is uniform across the region and confirms the strong dominant patterns in observed water storage signals in fact in section 4 1 fig 4 the water storage drops strongly from september october to april may then an uptrend takes place till september this seasonal signal occurs each year with period of overall inter annual trends the 2nd mode tws 2 pc 2 accounts for 1 55 of the total variability and depicts a prevalent loading in the south west an area nearer to the coastal sedimentary basin bsc its temporal pattern is seasonal and the inter annual trends are similar to one mentioned above in pc 1 in the 3rd mode tws 3 pc 3 the spatial loading is less significant as this explains 0 5 of the total variability and the temporal pattern tends to represent the noise in the signal 4 2 2 gldas tws the uncorrelated variables derived from gldas tws also known as the principal components eq 8 are represented in the fig 7 and 78 2 of the total variance is explained by the first two components pc1 and pc2 with a variance of 52 5 the pc1 depicts a multi annual amplitude expressed by the two uptrends 2006 2013 and 2016 2019 and two downtrends 2003 2006 and 2013 2016 as noticed in the original dataset according to the pc2 series there are a downtrend with a sen s slope of 0 002 unit yr starting from 2003 to 2012 and a second uptrend 0 0002 unit yr which continue till 2019 this pattern in the pc2 is relatively similar to the one observed in both the soil moisture sm and canopy water cw which highlight an overall persistent dry period as above mentioned fig 3c and d further the evapotranspiration trend patterns are close to the third pc and reveal possible relationship linking the tws to climatic parameters in the study area fig 3b elsewhere this is proved in past works ferreira et al 2020 ndehedehe et al 2018a 2018b zheng et al 2019 indicating rainfall influence on terrestrial water resources more specifically from 2003 to 2014 a rise in the signal has reached a sen s slope value of 0 0002 unit yr and the following downtrend brought the value to 0 0001 unit yr the fourth pc is less represented 8 5 in the total variance and can be attribute to the residual in the tws dataset fig 3f 4 2 3 watergap gws the multivariate analysis through principal component analysis is also applied to the watergap gws dataset described in the methodology section to identify from groundwater storage change perspective what are the imbedded patterns which could contribute to a better understanding of water resources dynamic in this hard rock area from 2000 to 2016 the watergap gws has fluctuated between 0 8 kg m 2 and 86 1 kg m 2 with an average and standard deviation values of respectively 21 58 kg m 2 and 18 3 kg m 2 an adjustment to a distribution law using the python library reliability shows that the best fit is the two parameters exponential distribution law with Œ≥ and Œª respectively 0 75 and 0 05 the sen s slope of the water storage during this period is low and negative 0 04 kg m 2 yr 1 and could be indicative of the aquifers recharge and discharge balance throughout the past decades furthermore three principal components are retrieved from the watergap gws signal and compared to the monthly gldas tws its sub domains derived product gws and trmm precipitation using pearson s correlation in a way to understand and identify the revealed patterns the first two components pc1 and pc2 account for the maximum explained variance 62 7 and 37 2 it turns out that there is a strong and positive correlation between the pc1 and tws 0 81 and gws 0 83 moreover the correlation between pc2 and the rainfall 0 71 the canopy water content 0 74 and gws 0 82 are also strongly positive fig 8 the soil moisture sm in the unsaturated and water transition zone is captured with lower but not negligible correlation coefficient respectively 0 58 and 0 54 for the pc1 and pc2 the pc3 variance is too low to be considered in the interpretation and even the pearson s correlations are quite low the retrieved signal could be assimilated to the noise contained in the input dataset the pc1 depicts best the terrestrial water storage and its underground sub domains while the pc2 shows stronger accuracy in the climatic parameters estimation plants greenness and the groundwater change neither the pc1 nor the pc2 is enough accurate to predict the evapotranspiration and this consequently is a clue to explain how hard it is to predict climatic fluxes using only the water storage change nevertheless the tws and gws remain the best predictors of the evapotranspiration respectively 0 54 and 0 55 showing the influence of the land water storage by the climatic fluxes these evidence prove the accuracy and efficiency of the pca application in terrestrial water assessment as from one terrestrial storage component the hidden patterns can be retrieved and consequently contribute to the recognition of other components whether terrestrial water related or climatic 4 3 groundwater recharge depletion gwr d 4 3 1 linking groundwater change to rainfall the groundwater change signals eq 10 over the past two decades based on the gldas gws fluctuate between 171 2 mm and 303 8 mm and the overall median is 29 4 mm with a standard deviation sd of 111 9 mm fig 10 notably standard deviation sd can sometimes be substantially higher than parameter value or mean when there is high variation between values in the hydrological units this higher sd could also be predicated on the relatively large data distribution of groundwater fluctuations the nature of groundwater recharge will be dependent on the characteristics of rainfall frequency duration intensity and land use change in the region the latter change infiltration and runoff properties which in turn regulate recharge and evapotranspiration thus reduced recharge can be compounded when irrigation for agriculture occurs more frequently and intensively due to drought or limited rainfall this inevitably or arguably can drive the extreme anomalies or wide distribution in groundwater signals in the region the trmm rainfall dataset is compared to the signals using the pearson s correlation coefficient pcc t test for mean comparison and f test for linear dependency test it turns out that there is a linear dependency between the groundwater change signals and the daily precipitation f test 1 00 with a positive correlation of 0 69 the t statistic value is 0 22 and the p value of 0 82 is greater than the 10 threshold which shows that the null hypothesis of equal average cannot be rejected further the percentage of change can reach 2 6 4 5 mm in the dry season around april and 6 1 11 9 mm during the end of the second rain season from october to november each year the gws series provides a clue about aquifer systems renewability and their possible influence on boreholes flow the gws change cycle is almost constant throughout the study period except for the year 2005 and 2015 with respectively an average gws of 0 13 1 1 mm and 0 15 1 1 mm which can be considered as poor groundwater recharge periods as mentioned in the section 3 1 6 each of the four monitoring wells are located in the affon zou okpara and couffo sub basins and have seen their water tables fluctuate respectively from 1 06 1 52 m 2 95 2 79 m 2 08 2 68 m and 1 12 1 1 m the monthly series are fitted for the wells by using the linear trend function sens slope eq 7 and it turns out that the water table has increased by 1 44 m yr 2 0 m yr 3 2 m yr and 0 56 m yr these slightly positive trends coincide with the gldas tws and gws and grace tws uptrends notified in the same period sections 4 1 and 4 2 1 despite the wet signal confirmation in the global model the gravity field derived water thickness and in the in situ measurements the canopy water content cw and the vegetation lclu have dropped significantly 4 3 2 storage mode the quantile function of storage eq 11 depicts the percentage of time required for a particular component to lose or gain the stored water referring to the intersection of the curve with the zero net level based on the monthly values the graph shows that the basement beneath the 9th latitude lost groundwater gws 57 of the time and gain water 43 of the time from 2003 to 2019 which could be revealing of boreholes discharge periodic drop down related to the dry season fig 11a in fact the four monitoring wells have lost water respectively 58 58 60 4 and 50 1 of the time in the affon zou okpara and couffo sub basins respectively this borehole productivity issue has been raised from groundwater potential analysis perspective oussou et al 2019 and from fractured aquifers hydrodynamic properties analysis perspective oussou et al 2020 the tws and sm are more resilient in face of water resources seasonal dryness as they lost water storage respectively 51 and 47 during the study period moreover the tws and gws maximum water gain have reached respectively 199 2 mm and 193 9 mm which occurred at a probability of exceedance of 1 of the period meanwhile the maximum water loss are 139 2 mm and 106 2 mm respectively exceeded 99 of the time the unsaturated vadose zone which is expressed by the sm component has a maximum water gain of 53 9 mm although this value is exceeded only 1 of the time the agriculture potential of the area is sustained by a water gain of 53 probability of exceedance the highest soil water loss in contrary is 39 6 mm and is exceeded 99 of the time groundwater storage responds more rapidly to the seasonal water change than the tws and the sm significantly sustain the overall water storage the slope s qfs between 33 and 66 which represents the storage at 33rd and 66th percentiles are respectively 0 93 0 26 and 0 68 for the tws sm and gws the sm detains a higher water storage potential compared to the gws this evidence put together with its lower water loss 47 of the time confirms the fact that the unsaturated zone is more likely to stay wet as not only it is the first component to receive rainfall but also benefits water loss from aquifers gws the cumulative storage deficit eq 12 throughout a study period is computed to reveal the inter annual trends with the uptrend corresponding to the wet hydrological season and the dry season expressed by the downtrend from 2008 till 2015 there have been a wet hydrological uptrend in gws cumulative storage triggered by the rainfall which is conceived to master the water source for the terrestrial water storage the same patterns are pointed out in the four monitoring wells which span from 2004 to 2014 affon zou okpara and couffo sub basins and 2007 2014 couffo sub basin the cumulative storage deficits have reached respectively more than 500 316 372 and 169 with seasonal signals the period is preceded by a no trend period which extends from 2003 to late 2007 the wet period shows very little lag as the land storage components gws and sm respond almost at the same time with the rainfall signal after a dry hydrological season occurred till 2018 in the gws and sm with a lag of three years compared to the rainfall the precipitation cumulative storage deficit shows a second lag period extending from 2016 to 2018 during that period a new uptrend has occurred and brought the groundwater and soil moisture storage to a new high 4 3 3 gwr d supervised learning and prediction this section explains the analysis of the ability of the independent variables cf section 3 2 4 3 to reproduce groundwater change signals using machine learning technics the supervised classification models namely random forest extra trees regressor k neighbors regressor and decision tree were trained with 60 of the daily dataset and the remain is used to test each performance for the model s evaluation and comparison purpose six metrics eqs 14 19 such as the mean absolute error mae mean square error mse root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient r2 root mean squared logarithmic error rmsle and mean absolute percentage error mape were computed to measure models performance table 3 the extra trees regressor best fit the testing dataset in this case with a correlation coefficient of 0 92 and the lowest prediction errors followed by the random forest 0 88 k neighbors regressor 0 86 and decision tree 0 78 the overall performance reveals the relatively high accuracy of each model to contribute to groundwater hydrographs prediction in the study area figure 12 presents the prediction error for the extra trees regressor fig 12a the feature importance plot fig 12b and the prediction plot fig 12c and it turns out that the prediction correlation coefficient reaches 0 94 confirming the accuracy of the model and its usefulness to assess groundwater signals in areas where there is serious lack of groundwater fluctuation data according to the predictors importance plot fig 12b a change in groundwater storage signal is more likely to reflect on the vegetation canopy water content cw followed by the rainfall and the root zone soil moisture sm based on the metrics the lowest mae mse and rmse are attributed to the extra trees regressor respectively 0 39 mm 0 57 mm and 0 69 mm moreover the actual and predicted groundwater change gws accuracy has reached a correlation coefficient of 0 92 in this basement area the trained model can be useful to assess seasonal water table fluctuation and therefore empower the drinking water wells monitoring across the sector the less important predictors are grace derived products except the first order difference which represents a change in water level 5 discussion understanding the spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater has been at the center of several studies in recent times in this basement area of benin the need to assess aquifers resilience to drought and land cover change has become crucial to support water resources planning for better drinking water supply and allocation as an attempt to address this issue global hydrological models gldas and watergap remote sensing products trmm precipitation and grace tws esa land cover and in situ measurements were assessed to identify the land water storage dynamics and patterns in climatic fluxes across the basement area in benin below the 9th latitude even though the region witnesses four climatic seasons each year it turns out through this study that there are three land water storage seasons the first land water storage dry season matches the first climatic dry season which starts from january to march april for the soil moisture sm to april may for the tws and canopy water and to may june for the groundwater storage gws it should be noted that there is a kind of chronology in the terrestrial water storage components change which starts with sm then the tws canopy water and gws therefore a new hydrogeological season is launched firstly by the water storage change in the unsaturated zone which obviously increases the overall tws and affects the aquifers water table the single wet hydrogeological season takes the maximum time and covers the first rain season the smaller dry season around august and the second rain season which ends around october november these aforementioned analyses suggest that the reliable moment of the year to drill a borehole in this hard rock area is around march april as the land water storage generally is at its lowest during this period the probability to get a better discharge across the year is high and could provide more security for the borehole resilience to drought during that period observed sen s slope in averaged tws can reach 41 6 26 4 mm yr and consequently the wet season is noticeable in each component as shown in this study the first and second dry hydrogeological season have sen s slope values of respectively 29 1 17 7 mm yr and 53 7 31 6 mm yr and aligns with reported trends in past studies ndehedehe et al 2016b and zheng et al 2019 the second dry seasons drop is faster and confirms both the evidence found in the quantile function of storage qfs which reveals that the groundwater gws loss in this region occurred 57 of the time furthermore in the south of the 7th latitude specifically in the lower ou√©m√© catchment valley flood event occurs each year starting around september october moniod et al 1972 based on the strong water storage loss in the second dry hydrogeological season the flood events could benefit from water discharge in the surface water features although this might require thorough cases analysis changes in terrestrial water storage represent an interesting indicator of whether wells assigned for drinking supply are able to sustain the increasing water need and face climatic pressures e g drought within the study period two inter annual wet hydrological periods are noticed extending from 2006 to 2013 and 2016 2019 and characterized by respectively sen s slope values of 1 16 mm yr and 4 47 mm yr the past four years has seen an uptrend signal which is quite significant in the tws 4 47 mm yr gws 3 27 mm yr sm 0 93 mm yr cw 0 0005 mm yr and trmm precipitation 0 014 mm yr these resulst can be considered as a contribution to complement past studies undertaken at a lower or regional scale such as descroix et al 2009 ndehedehe et al 2016b ndehedehe 2019 blunden and arndt 2020 however because of spatial scale issues they should be interpreted with caution further soil moisture sm and canopy water components reveal a clear downtrend starting from 2008 through 2016 while evapotranspiration has persistently increased with the sen s slope value of 0 19 mm yr for sm and 0 0001 mm yr for canopy water during that period two land cover maps of the beginning and the ending are interpreted to check if the dry event is notice able in the vegetation cover dynamic based on the two esa sentinel 2 based lclu data there is a remarkable drop in the tree cover areas by 25 5 3086 7 sqkm an increase in the cropland and shrubs areas respectively 136 9 4847 7 sqkm and 69 6 1092 9 sqkm the vegetation areas losses in this central part of benin were also reported by oloukoi 2012 and lucas et al 2015 confirming the downtrend pattern identified in both canopy water and sm the pearson s correlation coefficient of tws versus evapotranspiration series 0 54 is a further proof of the probable relationship between the terrestrial water storage and climatic fluxes considering the groundwater storage change the pcc is 0 89 with the plant canopy water content canopy water 0 69 with precipitation and 0 79 with soil moisture these relatively strong and positive correlations are the evidence of the fact that water seepage through the unsaturated zone trigger surface and subsurface water storage components the multivariate analysis of gldas tws shows that the first and second pcs together account for 78 2 of the total variance with pc1 revealing the 4 trends noticed across the study period fig 3e and f the temporal pattern of pc2 is similar to the soil moisture sm and canopy water content series as the overall persistent dry period 2008 2016 is revealed in the retrieved signal during that same period the evapotranspiration has risen and this uptrend is depicted in the third pc 12 03 the fourth pc pattern is assimilated to the noise in the tws these decomposed sub domains of the gldas tws and grace tws are proved to give clues about both climatic and hydrologic parameters such as the precipitation ndehedehe et al 2021 zheng et al 2019 evapotranspiration ndehedehe et al 2018a 2018b soil moisture abiy and melesse 2017 groundwater d√∂ll et al 2014 and land water storage wahr et al 1998 on the other hand the principal component analysis is also applied to the watergap gws 21 6 18 3 kg m 2 and it turns out that pc1 and pc2 concentrates more than 99 of the total explained variance there is a strong and positive correlation coefficient pcc between pc1 versus tws 0 81 and gws 0 83 although pc2 is less correlated to these land storage components it gives a better correlation coefficient with precipitation 0 71 canopy water content 0 74 and gws 0 82 the lowest correlation coefficients are noticed with evapotranspiration which is hard to predict as the best values are respectively 0 54 and 0 55 for tws and gws however the overall picture shows that the pca is sufficiently efficient to identify the dominant and other important hydrological patterns in the watergap gws series to understand groundwater change regime and potential impacts on future land water d√∂ll et al 2014 herbert and d√∂ll 2019 regardless of the climatic zone rainfall change is generally confirmed to be an initiator of land water storage change though depending on climate complexity lags might occur in the patterns with the rainfall leading ndehedehe et al 2021 ferreira et al 2020 ndehedehe 2019 rodell et al 2018 zheng et al 2019 schwatke et al 2015 forootan et al 2014 tong et al 2006 for the purpose of evaluating the existing link the two series are compared using the pearson s correlation coefficient pcc the mean comparison t test and the linear dependency f test to find out the reciprocal influence that explain aquifers recharge and depletion in this basement area the calculated t statistic is 0 22 with the p value 0 82 greater than the 10 threshold which means that the null hypothesis of equal averages cannot be rejected for the rainfall change p versus groundwater storage change gws though the null hypothesis of equal averages is rejected for the daily precipitation versus the gws with p value smaller than the 1 threshold the confirmed similarity of the rainfall change p and groundwater storage change gws series is further proved 0 69 the highest negative change is 2 6 4 5 mm around april while the highest positive change occurred around october november and has reached 6 1 11 9 mm the aquifers system renewal in the area tends to be constant throughout the last decades but the year 2005 and 2015 are registered to be the poorest recharge periods as the daily average changes were negative respectively 0 13 1 1 mm and 0 15 1 1 mm the basement land water storage is further explored using the qfs to evaluate the behaviour of the water resources through each water budget component in fact soil moisture water gain is 53 probability of exceedance and stand for the proof that the unsaturated transition zone remains a water storage regulator between the groundwater gws table and plants root zone canopy water this finding corroborates the study by hector et al 2015 who affirmed that the surface mass variations linked to intra seasonal water storage change originate from heterogeneity in the vadose zone it is substantiated through qfs technique that aquifers in this basement area loose water storage faster fig 11a and have lower storage potential compared to sm this reality is portrayed in the four monitoring wells hydrographs mentioned in section 4 3 2 where the corresponding minimum water gain in the four monitoring wells which occurred at 99 probability of exceedance turned over at respectively 1 06 m 2 94 m 2 09 m and 1 12 m for the affon zou okpara and couffo sub basins additionally oussou et al 2020 raised the issue of the basement aquifers relatively low productivity and the complex spatial distribution of the boreholes discharge although major fracture orientations such as n10 n20 n90 n100 n170 n180 and others not negligible orientations combined with the cross point cp fracture density and coincidence map could lead to higher discharge groundwater areas the delicacy of the borehole implantation process in the area is then further recommended the present study also corroborates the groundwater potential analysis undertaken in the zou catchment located at the west of the study area oussou et al 2019 which compartmented the basin into 52 very low to moderate groundwater potential another work in alignment with the findings of this study is all√© 2019 who estimated the proportion of negative boreholes e g percentage of lost borehole during wells drilling to be around 40 and advocated consequently the use of a geophysical technique electrical tomography to amend groundwater prospection considering the monthly cumulative storage deficit sd the temporal pattern uncovers rainfall to be a primary source which regulates the tws components the pearson correlation coefficient of the monthly precipitation versus monitoring wells hydrographs postulate to these findings as the average value for the study area is 0 75 similar lag in the series has been reported over west africa ndehedehe et al 2016b nicholson et al 2003 and this pattern could be revealing of the fact that today land water storage is governed by a much more complex combination of past storages and climatic fluxes more recently a new wet season has brought the sd to new highs as the signal has been noticed since 2016 in the precipitation followed by both the gws and sm after a 2 year lag fig 11b due to limited data time span a fair comparison couldn t be made with the monitoring wells hydrographs though the water storage evaluation through in situ gravity measurements using the superconducting gravimeter has provided valuable insight on groundwater signals which is in alignment with some findings of this study hector et al 2015 2014 2013 hinderer et al 2012 the prediction feature importance plot shows that a change in groundwater storage is more likely to impact the canopy water content this evidence is confirmed by the computed pearson s correlation coefficient matrix fig 9 as the canopy water versus gws gives the second highest pcc 0 89 it appears as a considerable evidence that some vegetated areas might be a groundwater controlled or groundwater dependent ecosystems in fact the geological lithology from top to bottom is partitioned into three main zones namely weathered layer fractured zone and bedrock the groundwater in the weathered zone has the same characteristic like an unconfined aquifer depending on the percentage of clay therefore a drop in water table leaves the aquifers top without water causing water access and nutrient supplies unavailable to surface roots canadell et al 1996 schwinning 2010 and estrada medina et al 2012 cited by pierret et al 2016 the present study corroborates this fact and even though there is not a particular work undertaken in the area on plants rooting and groundwater freycon et al 2015 concluded that deep rooting could be common in african semi deciduous rain forests with a marked dry season based on these multiple lines of evidence the canopy water storage importance in the prediction might be a clue to further understanding the relationship between groundwater level change and plants rooting in this hard rock areas this evidence might also be attributed to anthropogenic actions expressed by the deforestation expansion of agricultural areas farmlands and population growth the four grace related predictors reveal that a change in the overall tws grace tws is more likely to indicate a groundwater level change than grace gtdi grace pc1 and grace tws respectively through this study the ml classification models are further proved to be a reliable tool to predict both groundwater storage and water table change in almost any climatic and hydrologic conditions fallah mehdipour et al 2013 sahoo et al 2017 el ibrahimi et al 2017 nhu et al 2020 qi and song 2020 6 conclusions the basement terrestrial water beneath the 9th latitude in benin is assessed through diverse spatial and temporal analysis of the global model and remote sensing products a set of findings about the basement aquifers is added to improve the state of knowledge provided till now by the limited existing gauge stations data from terrestrial water storage to climatic components the last two decades intra and inner annual hydrological regime patterns based on the tws gws sm cw precipitation and evapotranspiration have been evaluated to understand water resources availability it turns out that terrestrial water storage tws has gone through 4 hydrological periods from 2003 to 2019 2 wet and 2 dry and on the inner annual basis 3 seasons occurred each year 1 wet and 2 dry the boreholes discharge changes across the year are better explained and confirmed in the in situ measurement therefore the lower storage period should be considered by decision makers to plan future national water supply campaigns the storage mode analysis through qfs and sd provides further understanding about the aquifers as the gws lost water 57 of the time with a lower storage potential compared to the sm the application of the multivariate technique to assess variability in gldas tws grace tws and watergap gws has proved to be a valuable tool to retrieve hidden patterns be it climatic signal or terrestrial water related the comparative analysis of the groundwater storage change gws versus trmm based precipitation has shown that even though rainfall might be a primary source which triggers change in the aquifer water table the present day rainfall is less likely to affect the present groundwater storage the machine learning model et regressor performs best in the groundwater storage change prediction with the highest correlation coefficient and the lowest error the rate of unsuccessful boreholes in the study area has been for long time a challenging issue because of the basement aquifers complexity in benin but the findings from this study have shed some light on what is known for long time to be the most serious populations drinking water supply problem in these fractured aquifers some main results are summarized as followed the two wet hydrological seasons extended from 2006 to 2013 and 2016 2019 showing sen s slope values of 1 16 mm yr and 4 47 mm yr respectively but the two dry hydrological seasons indicated sen s slopes of 1 01 mm yr 2003 2006 and 1 19 mm yr 2013 2016 between 2004 and 2014 the in situ water table measurement increased by 1 44 mm yr 2 0 mm yr 3 2 mm yr and 0 56 mm yr within a year and unlike the 4 climatic seasons 3 hydrological seasons are noticed in tws changes the dry season january to april may 29 1 17 7 mm yr the wet season april may to october november 41 6 26 4 mm yr and the dry season november to december 53 7 31 6 mm yr the reliable moment of the year to drill a borehole in this hard rock area is around march april as the land water storage generally is at the lowest a persistent dry period from 2008 to 2016 has affected the unsaturated zone sm and the plant greenness cw increasing the evapotranspiration and later reverse both the tws and gws from 2013 during that period the tree covers have dropped by 25 5 3086 7 sqkm the computed quantile function of

percentiles is respectively 0 93 0 68 and 0 26 therefore the aquifers have a lower storage potential compared to the soil moisture and loses water most of the time around april generally the highest negative gws change reaches 4 5 mm while the highest positive change takes place around october november 11 9 mm the aquifer s renewal in the area tends to be constant throughout the last decades but

8077,study region fractured aquifers in benin have emerged in the past decades as a critical resource because of the increasing domestic water needs agriculture and livestock breeding hence this study was undertaken in the poorly gauged and complex basement aquifers beneath the 9th latitude study focus to aid water resources management and sustainability this study combined satellite remote sensing products with outputs from hydrological models and in situ measurement to assess the spatial and temporal patterns of water storage changes including groundwater the fractured aquifers hydrogeological regime is further analysed through monitoring wells series interpretation new hydrological insights for the region results show considerable inter annual variations in terrestrial water storage tws during the study period 2003 2019 two uptrend intervals characterized by wet hydrological seasons from 2006 to 2013 and 2016 2019 with respectively sen s slope values of 1 16 mm yr and 4 47 mm yr were observed however two downtrend intervals represented by dry hydrological seasons with sen s slopes of 1 01 mm yr 2003 2006 and 1 19 mm yr 2013 2016 were also observed the inter annual seasonality in land water storage components showed that unlike the 4 climatic seasons the hydrogeological regime is affected by 3 seasons each year the first dry season takes place from january to april may 29 1 17 7 mm yr followed by the wet season april may to october november 41 6 26 4 mm yr and the last dry period which is stronger november to december 53 7 31 6 mm yr soil moisture sm and canopy water content cw declined during the 2008 2016 period coinciding with decline in tree cover areas which dropped by 25 5 3086 7 sqkm further from 2007 to 2014 the four monitoring wells have seen the groundwater level increased by 1 44 m yr 2 0 m yr 3 2 m yr and 0 56 m yr for the affon zou okpara and couffo sub basins respectively the retrieved tws and water global assessment and prognosis groundwater storage watergap gws sub domains based on statistical decomposition was used to identify hidden patterns to improve knowledge on the climatic and hydrological conditions which affected land water storage moreover tws gws and sm lost water 51 57 and 47 of the time respectively during the period and the storage potential is lower for the aquifers compared to the unsaturated zone precipitation is recognized as a primary driver of gws r 0 69 Œ± 0 05 in the region and a change in gws is more likely to drive the cw and affect the vegetation greenness moreover the anthropogenic pressure exacerbates tree cover loss additionally the extra tree regressor performs best in the groundwater storage change gws prediction with a strong and positive pearson correlation coefficient of 0 92 the basement aquifers assessment using the aforementioned approach has potential to support large scale monitoring efforts for more reliable water resources management in the region keywords aquifers canopy water hydrology terrestrial water storage soil moisture groundwater 1 introduction water resources management be it surface or groundwater is critical for adequate response to climatic constraints and anthropogenic influence strong changes in global climate through reduced precipitation and rising temperature affect natural systems e g decreased groundwater recharge as well as discharge to streams leading to threats in global water resources usman et al 2021 blunden and arndt 2020 in developing countries each time the water budget balance tilts persistently towards dryness social crisis like famine waterborne diseases and poverty are likely e g agutu et al 2017 as the land water content is mainly controlled by groundwater occurrence blunden and arndt 2020 several studies have revealed the alarming anthropogenic and climate change pressure on aquifers and hydro ecological systems e g ndehedehe et al 2021 the basement area beneath the 9th latitude in benin republic west africa is one of such regions where water budget components have been influenced in various ways by these factors for example between 1975 and 2013 a rise in agricultural areas reached 27 1 of the total country area with an increase of 600 sq km per year was reported by lucas et al 2015 this land use land cover change over the last decades triggered water resource vulnerability in the area through habitat degradation and biodiversity loss typical aquifer system in this area is separated mainly in 3 levels from bottom to the top the fractured matrix the relatively high interstice porosity zone weathered and the unsaturated laterite in contact with the atmosphere in this basement discontinuous aquifers geometric and hydrodynamic assessment require improving understanding especially about the fractured and weathered zone as well as the upper unsaturated medium boukari 1982 the national wells database reveal that even at a local scale there are substantial changes in the wells characteristics related to the unfolded alteration process erosion intensity and prevailing climatic and hydrologic conditions the drinking water boreholes database represents the available knowledge of the aquifers despite the location and depth subjectivity monitoring wells network is not dense enough to capture the aquifers complex hydrodynamic properties which evolves according to geology geomorphology and the unfolding climatic conditions recommended equipment and a qualified team required for efficient wells monitoring are costly and time consuming for the national department the available wells time series data are short and not reliable for adequate analysis and prediction as it is challenging to maintain permanent qualified team for the task consistent efforts are made for drinking water supply but from hydrogeological perspective these wells characteristics do not depict accurately aquifers properties this happens because the wells flow generally depends on the community water need rather than the aquifer s capacity monitoring the changes in water table is required for perennial and sustainable wells discharge in the future boukari 2002 the national piezometer network rpn was in place since 1989 and has recently reached 107 piezometers omidelta 2020 in basement areas the aquifers are discontinuous unlike in sedimentary areas therefore water table level maps are less reliable for this reason and equipment high cost problem the rpn past projects were executed mainly in sedimentary basins but for groundwater recharge and depletion gwr d monitoring purpose which is critical for water resources renewal observation there is a serious need to cover poorly gauged fractured aquifers cf livre bleu b√©nin 2009 therefore the temporal variation in the earth s surface mass retrieved from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and grace follow on grace fo and transformed into equivalent water thickness e g ferreira et al 2020 ndehedehe et al 2020 zheng et al 2019 offers for now the most accurate and reliable uniform solution to fill both the temporal and spatial gap hindering aquifers storage change understanding groundwater fluxes and storages estimated from inverted gravity observations to tws could significantly improve and complete the rpn moreover drinking water supply in riparian communities can be improved using the water table level estimation through data assimilation methods the combination of remote sensing and outputs from hydrological models provides an innovative approach to investigating changes in hydrological stores surface water or groundwater in large catchments with nasa s recent improvement in global land data assimilation system gldas land surface models lsms the uncertainty around groundwater abstraction impacts in emerging economies could become less blurred additionally the long term trends in gwr d state due to the lack of measurements and non uniform estimation technique across large areas could be mitigated further annual tws changes are recognized to be an acceptable indicator for groundwater storage changes the latter being insufficiently observed in most of the world blunden and arndt 2020 li et al 2015 across africa several grace hydrological studies have been undertaken in lake victoria getirana et al 2020 sub sahara africa mcnally et al 2017 upper greater horn of africa agutu et al 2019 lake chad ndehedehe et al 2016b and neukum et al 2021 upper blue nile jung et al 2017 and west africa ndehedehe et al 2016a these studies combined grace and lsms products to improve knowledge on the spatial and temporal variability in tws terrestrial water storage including water storage change reservoirs water level fluctuations drought and flood impacts on freshwater ecosystems some areas in west africa displayed a significant positive trend in tws variations but the inconsistency with rainfall soil moisture and tws was attributed to land surface conditions and complex hydrological processes ndehedehe et al 2018a 2018b this evidence is applicable in hard rock areas at the local scale as the characteristics of groundwater wells can fluctuate abruptly from one site to a relatively nearer one in tws budget evaluation across the globe rodell et al 2018 estimated an average positive trend of 24 1 2 1 gt yr 1 with a slower downtrend in the precipitation 0 12 0 01 mm yr 1 for west africa countries between latitudes 5¬∫n and 15¬∫n include this study area have seen a leading annual amplitude in the long term variations in rainfall soil moisture and tws moreover the earth s gravity change measurement with in situ gravimeters offers another possibilities to monitor hydrological stores in occurrence groundwater recharge hector et al 2014 2013 in addition to the impacts of climate on gwr in the hard rock region geological features such as fractures and alterations significantly delineate groundwater potential oussou et al 2019 furthermore ali and lebel 2009 highlights the scale matter bearing upon the water resources evaluation over the sahel where a significantly dry season is recognized in 2006 across the whole area while there is a significantly wet area of 15 the outcome of a scientific community initiative recently highlighted 23 unsolved problems in hydrology which in its 4th point specifies the need to assess the land cover change and soil disturbances impacts on water and energy fluxes at the land surface and on the resulting groundwater recharge bl√∂schl et al 2019 the unproductive wells rate across the whole country basement especially beneath the 9th latitude remain a real concern and requires a thorough understanding of the hydrological systems and

tool in hydrosphere fluxes and storages evaluation for better understanding of the climate history and prediction terrestrial water subsurface characteristics are computed in the lsms based on darcy 1d and 2d and richard laws from the land surface to the aquifer the water cycle subsurface process is defined by firstly the infiltration which is controlled by the soil properties topography and

terrestrial water storage sw inland surface reservoirs cw canopy water sm soil moisture and Œ¥ gw represents groundwater loss or gain each component is derived from remote sensing and global model datasets depending on how accurate it represents the corresponding hydrological layer in the region the updated national topographic maps provided by institut g√©ographique national ign 2017 give an exhaustive list of the surface water features the largest lake surface in the basement area beneath the 9th latitude is less than 4 sq km the combination of all surface water in the area is assumed to be negligible compared to other tws components cancelling the sw quantity which is related to surface water the gldas derived products temporal trend are processed using the seasonal decomposition function of the python library statsmodel the 365 day rolling mean the mann kendall python library kenda et al 2018 and the sen s slope regression hussain and mahmud 2019 the mann kendall test reveals the upward or downward monotonic trend in the series and the sen s slope gives the magnitude meaning the increase or decrease in the values per year eq 7 7 s k median tws j tws i j i for 1 i j n with s k the slope estimate and tws j and tws i are the tws values at time j and i 3 2 3 multivariate analysis the principal component analysis pca method is applied respectively to the gldas tws components and watergap gws the original data sets decomposition into sub domains brings up valuable information about both the spatial and temporal pattern brown 1998 the principal component analysis is applied to explore the hidden temporal variabilities embedded in the gldas tws components ndehedehe et al 2016b as explained in trauth 2006 the visualization of high dimensional data sets requires the reduction of dimensionality which is chosen in this case to decompose the tws components into principal components pcs the principal components decomposition is formulated as follow eq 8 8 y 1 a 11 x 1 a 12 x 2 a 1 p x p y 1 a 21 x 1 a 22 x 2 a 2 p x p y n a n 1 x 1 a n 2 x 2 a np x p where y 1 y 2 y n stands for the principal components x 1 x 2 x p for the variables and a 11 a 12 a 1 p a n 1 a n 2 a np are the loadings also known as principal component scores or the eigenvectors the loadings express each variable influence on the pc and are derived from the data sets covariance or correlation matrix 3 2 4 groundwater recharge depletion analysis 3 2 4 1 groundwater change signal computation the groundwater storage change both recharge and depletion caused by climate change effects and more importantly due to human groundwater abstraction has assessed based on different data source like global model products satellite images and well observations rodell et al 2009 mcguire 2011 schuh 2013 d√∂ll et al 2014 schmied et al 2016 herbert and d√∂ll 2019 ferreira et al 2020 ndehedehe et al 2018a 2018b in this case the gwr d temporal change is evaluated computing the first order differencing on the data sets which is a simple de trend technic and the storage mode quantile function of storage and storage deficit the first order differencing eq 9 is generated by calculating the difference between the groundwater storage at t 1 and t formulated as followed 9 with x t Œ≤ 0 Œ≤ 1 t Œµ t 9 z t x t 1 x t Œ≤ 1 Œµ t 1 Œµ t where z t dgws dt and Œµ t is the noise 3 2 4 2 storage mode the duration curve cf eq 10 12 also represented by quantile function of storage ferreira et al 2020 is computed for this basement as there have been a persistent issue of drinking water wells dryness expressed by groundwater depletion and flow decrease overtime awange et al 2014 have applied this method to tws data sets which is basically the probability of exceedance of a storage value helsel and hirsch 2002 10 p m n 1 100 m the ranked position in the listing and n the number of months the slope of the quantile function of storage s qfs is negative and calculated between the storage 33rd s 33 and 66th s 66 percentiles using the expression below 11 s qfs s 33 s 66 66 33 as mentioned above the amplitude in the tws components can make wells go through a periodic fluctuation thus the monthly percentage water storage deficit known as storage deficit is also computed to provide the national water department and other water users with groundwater change seasons in the study area which is critical for drinking water wells monitoring the equation is expressed as follow narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 ferreira et al 2020 12 sd s i median s j max s j min s j 100 where s i is the storage value of a given month and the median s j min s j and max s j are respectively the entire series covering period eg tws gws median minimum and maximum 3 2 4 3 groundwater

target and nine independent variables from grace tws and derived products drought index principal component 1 and grace tws gldas and trmm products namely the previous gws gws t 1 the soil moisture sm t soil moisture first order differencing sm the canopy water content cw t and precipitation p the grace terrestrial water drought index gtdi is computed in adaptation to the grace groundwater drought index proposed by nigatu et al 2021 and thomas et al 2017 the grace terrestrial water storage which counts for the liquid water equivalent thickness is subtracted from the study area mean to obtain the terrestrial water storage deviation tsd the gtdi cf eq 13 is the normalized net deviation which is calculated by subtracting the tsd from its mean tsd and dividing the result by the standard deviation std tsd 13 gtdi i j tsd i j tsd std tsd the first component of the principal component analysis pca of the grace tws is computed and added to the predictors based on the performance in past works melesse et al 2020 the extra tree regressor random forests k neighbors regressor and decision tree algorithms are adjusted to the gws due to their relatively high correlation coefficients this choice is made for comparison purpose and to maximize the chance to distinguish the best prediction algorithm fig 2 and table 1 the validation metrics used for the four models performance evaluation

used to adjust multiple distribution laws to each components and sen s slope computed for significant uptrend or downtrend periods also the undertaken interpretations based on the techniques such as the inner annual pattern evaluation the land cover change detection the multivariate analysis through principal component analysis pca groundwater recharge depletion temporal analysis storage mode quantile function of storage and cumulative storage deficit and groundwater change prediction using machine learning are presented the climatic components trend seasonal amplitudes and residuals are extracted from the series fig 3a b considering the study period the rainfall depicts a first downtrend 2003 2006 an uptrend 2006 2011 a second downtrend 2011 2016 and ends with a new uptrend 2016 2019 the magnitude in the trends during each period expressed by the sen s slope values is 0 014 mm yr 0 008 mm yr 0 003 mm yr and 0 014 mm yr respectively the average daily rainfall is 3 52 mm with a standard deviation of 7 04 mm and the values oscillates between 0 mm and 85 3 mm after adjustment to different types of distribution law the best fit is given by weibull distribution law and its parameters alpha Œ± and beta Œ≤ are respectively 3 3 and 0 6 fig 3b reveals a persistent increase in the evapotranspiration signal extending from 2003 to 2015 which is remarkable in the land cover land use change during that period fig 5 in respond to this constraint the canopy water has dropped from 2008 to 2016 fig 3c confirming what can be interpreted as a climatic stress due to whether climate change or anthropogenic influences from 2003 to 2019 the terrestrial water storage tws in the basement area varies between 206 2 mm and 370 7 mm fig 3f table 2 the best fitting is weibull two

years 2003 2006 and the second downtrend occurred from 2013 to 2016 with a sen s slope values eq 7 which are respectively 1 01 mm yr and 1 19 mm yr the first downside performance in the tws is noticed in each component even in the precipitation and evapotranspiration series the second downtrend matches the gws trend in the same period and reflects an already existing downtrend 2008 2016 in both the soil moisture 0 19 mm yr and canopy water content 0 0001 mm yr but corresponds to an uptrend in the evapotranspiration fig 3b and d the uptrend periods last respectively seven years 2006 2013 depicting an overall wet period characterized by a sen s slope value of 1 16 mm yr and four years 2016 2019 with a sen s slope of 4 47 mm yr table 2 the study period last four years signals 2016 2019 have been confirmed in each dataset to be a strong and positive uptrend with a rise in the gws 3 27 mm yr sm 0 93 mm yr cw 0 0005 mm yr and obviously in the precipitation 0 014 mm yr following almost the same temporal pattern the groundwater storage gws fluctuates from 171 2 303 8 mm and fits the two parameters weibull distribution law with Œ± and Œ≤ which are 100 3 and 1 4 fig 3e further as the downtrend and uptrend periods match the tws ones the sen s slope values of the gws are respectively for the two downtrends 1 11 mm yr and 1 31 mm yr and for the uptrends 1 07 mm yr and 3 27 mm yr fig 4 shows the descriptive statistic of the inner annual change trends of the tws components which count for the total land water storage eq 10 within each year the storage change pattern exhibits two downtrend periods and one uptrend the first tipping point occurs between march and april for sm april and may for tws april and may for cw and may and june for gws these patterns coincide with the beginning of the rain season and reveal the order in which the land water storage progressively occurs in the area a saturated soil triggers plants activity which already affect the overall tws trend before the gws aquifers respond to change the beginning of a new hydrogeological regime the second tipping point marks the end of the year single uptrend respectively from october to november for both the tws and the gws and from september to october for the sm and the cw therefore three seasons are noticed in the patterns a dry season starting from january to april with an average sen s slope of 29 1 17 7 mm yr a wet season from april to october 41 6 26 4 mm yr and a dry season from october to december 53 7 31 6 mm yr the noticeable evidence from these values is the fact that terrestrial water storage gain takes longer time during the year while loss requires less time which could be indicative of this aquifers fast groundwater discharge the lclu in this part of benin has been affected negatively by both climate change effects and anthropogenic influence oloukoi 2017 lucas et al 2015 zheng et al 2019 the soil moisture sm and canopy water cw patterns reveal the period starting from 2008 to 2016 to be dry season for both the unsaturated root zone and the vegetation layer fig 4c and d this persistent decline especially in the sm brought the sen s slope to 0 19 mm yr which reflects on the land cover vegetated areas the european space agency esa land cover based on the sentinel 2 and other satellite scenes have been collected and it turns out that there has been a remarkable decline in the vegetated areas thus the tree cover areas in this period have dropped by 25 5 3086 7 sqkm in other hand the cropland and shrubs areas have respectively increased significantly by 136 9 4847 7 sqkm and 69 6 1092 9 sqkm which is a proof of human action on land cover consequently on the canopy water content cw based on the aforementioned evidence the tws components water loss can trigger the plant activities resulting consequently in the greenness decrease 4 2 multivariate analysis based on the principal component analysis 4 2 1 grace tws the key hydrological drivers of the grace tws are assessed through the spatial and temporal variability decomposition using the principal component analysis pca the highest proportion of the total variability represented in the first mode tws 1 pc1 is explained by 98 1 fig 6 due to the coarse spatial resolution relative to the study area extent which is rather small the first orthogonal mode of tws variability is uniform across the region and confirms the strong dominant patterns in observed water storage signals in fact in section 4 1 fig 4 the water storage drops strongly from september october to april may then an uptrend takes place till september this seasonal signal occurs each year with period of overall inter annual trends the 2nd mode tws 2 pc 2 accounts for 1 55 of the total variability and depicts a prevalent loading in the south west an area nearer to the coastal sedimentary basin bsc its temporal pattern is seasonal and the inter annual trends are similar to one mentioned above in pc 1 in the 3rd mode tws 3 pc 3 the spatial loading is less significant as this explains 0 5 of the total variability and the temporal pattern tends to represent the noise in the signal 4 2 2 gldas tws the uncorrelated variables derived from gldas tws also known as the principal components eq 8 are represented in the fig 7 and 78 2 of the total variance is explained by the first two components pc1 and pc2 with a variance of 52 5 the pc1 depicts a multi annual amplitude expressed by the two uptrends 2006 2013 and 2016 2019 and two downtrends 2003 2006 and 2013 2016 as noticed in the original dataset according to the pc2 series there are a downtrend with a sen s slope of 0 002 unit yr starting from 2003 to 2012 and a second uptrend 0 0002 unit yr which continue till 2019 this pattern in the pc2 is relatively similar to the one observed in both the soil moisture sm and canopy water cw which highlight an overall persistent dry period as above mentioned fig 3c and d further the evapotranspiration trend patterns are close to the third pc and reveal possible relationship linking the tws to climatic parameters in the study area fig 3b elsewhere this is proved in past works ferreira et al 2020 ndehedehe et al 2018a 2018b zheng et al 2019 indicating rainfall influence on terrestrial water resources more specifically from 2003 to 2014 a rise in the signal has reached a sen s slope value of 0 0002 unit yr and the following downtrend brought the value to 0 0001 unit yr the fourth pc is less represented 8 5 in the total variance and can be attribute to the residual in the tws dataset fig 3f 4 2 3 watergap gws the multivariate analysis through principal component analysis is also applied to the watergap gws dataset described in the methodology section to identify from groundwater storage change perspective what are the imbedded patterns which could contribute to a better understanding of water resources dynamic in this hard rock area from 2000 to 2016 the watergap gws has fluctuated between 0 8 kg m 2 and 86 1 kg m 2 with an average and standard deviation values of respectively 21 58 kg m 2 and 18 3 kg m 2 an adjustment to a distribution law using the python library reliability shows that the best fit is the two parameters exponential distribution law with Œ≥ and Œª respectively 0 75 and 0 05 the sen s slope of the water storage during this period is low and negative 0 04 kg m 2 yr 1 and could be indicative of the aquifers recharge and discharge balance throughout the past decades furthermore three principal components are retrieved from the watergap gws signal and compared to the monthly gldas tws its sub domains derived product gws and trmm precipitation using pearson s correlation in a way to understand and identify the revealed patterns the first two components pc1 and pc2 account for the maximum explained variance 62 7 and 37 2 it turns out that there is a strong and positive correlation between the pc1 and tws 0 81 and gws 0 83 moreover the correlation between pc2 and the rainfall 0 71 the canopy water content 0 74 and gws 0 82 are also strongly positive fig 8 the soil moisture sm in the unsaturated and water transition zone is captured with lower but not negligible correlation coefficient respectively 0 58 and 0 54 for the pc1 and pc2 the pc3 variance is too low to be considered in the interpretation and even the pearson s correlations are quite low the retrieved signal could be assimilated to the noise contained in the input dataset the pc1 depicts best the terrestrial water storage and its underground sub domains while the pc2 shows stronger accuracy in the climatic parameters estimation plants greenness and the groundwater change neither the pc1 nor the pc2 is enough accurate to predict the evapotranspiration and this consequently is a clue to explain how hard it is to predict climatic fluxes using only the water storage change nevertheless the tws and gws remain the best predictors of the evapotranspiration respectively 0 54 and 0 55 showing the influence of the land water storage by the climatic fluxes these evidence prove the accuracy and efficiency of the pca application in terrestrial water assessment as from one terrestrial storage component the hidden patterns can be retrieved and consequently contribute to the recognition of other components whether terrestrial water related or climatic 4 3 groundwater recharge depletion gwr d 4 3 1 linking groundwater change to rainfall the groundwater change signals eq 10 over the past two decades based on the gldas gws fluctuate between 171 2 mm and 303 8 mm and the overall median is 29 4 mm with a standard deviation sd of 111 9 mm fig 10 notably standard deviation sd can sometimes be substantially higher than parameter value or mean when there is high variation between values in the hydrological units this higher sd could also be predicated on the relatively large data distribution of groundwater fluctuations the nature of groundwater recharge will be dependent on the characteristics of rainfall frequency duration intensity and land use change in the region the latter change infiltration and runoff properties which in turn regulate recharge and evapotranspiration thus reduced recharge can be compounded when irrigation for agriculture occurs more frequently and intensively due to drought or limited rainfall this inevitably or arguably can drive the extreme anomalies or wide distribution in groundwater signals in the region the trmm rainfall dataset is compared to the signals using the pearson s correlation coefficient pcc t test for mean comparison and f test for linear dependency test it turns out that there is a linear dependency between the groundwater change signals and the daily precipitation f test 1 00 with a positive correlation of 0 69 the t statistic value is 0 22 and the p value of 0 82 is greater than the 10 threshold which shows that the null hypothesis of equal average cannot be rejected further the percentage of change can reach 2 6 4 5 mm in the dry season around april and 6 1 11 9 mm during the end of the second rain season from october to november each year the gws series provides a clue about aquifer systems renewability and their possible influence on boreholes flow the gws change cycle is almost constant throughout the study period except for the year 2005 and 2015 with respectively an average gws of 0 13 1 1 mm and 0 15 1 1 mm which can be considered as poor groundwater recharge periods as mentioned in the section 3 1 6 each of the four monitoring wells are located in the affon zou okpara and couffo sub basins and have seen their water tables fluctuate respectively from 1 06 1 52 m 2 95 2 79 m 2 08 2 68 m and 1 12 1 1 m the monthly series are fitted for the wells by using the linear trend function sens slope eq 7 and it turns out that the water table has increased by 1 44 m yr 2 0 m yr 3 2 m yr and 0 56 m yr these slightly positive trends coincide with the gldas tws and gws and grace tws uptrends notified in the same period sections 4 1 and 4 2 1 despite the wet signal confirmation in the global model the gravity field derived water thickness and in the in situ measurements the canopy water content cw and the vegetation lclu have dropped significantly 4 3 2 storage mode the quantile function of storage eq 11 depicts the percentage of time required for a particular component to lose or gain the stored water referring to the intersection of the curve with the zero net level based on the monthly values the graph shows that the basement beneath the 9th latitude lost groundwater gws 57 of the time and gain water 43 of the time from 2003 to 2019 which could be revealing of boreholes discharge periodic drop down related to the dry season fig 11a in fact the four monitoring wells have lost water respectively 58 58 60 4 and 50 1 of the time in the affon zou okpara and couffo sub basins respectively this borehole productivity issue has been raised from groundwater potential analysis perspective oussou et al 2019 and from fractured aquifers hydrodynamic properties analysis perspective oussou et al 2020 the tws and sm are more resilient in face of water resources seasonal dryness as they lost water storage respectively 51 and 47 during the study period moreover the tws and gws maximum water gain have reached respectively 199 2 mm and 193 9 mm which occurred at a probability of exceedance of 1 of the period meanwhile the maximum water loss are 139 2 mm and 106 2 mm respectively exceeded 99 of the time the unsaturated vadose zone which is expressed by the sm component has a maximum water gain of 53 9 mm although this value is exceeded only 1 of the time the agriculture potential of the area is sustained by a water gain of 53 probability of exceedance the highest soil water loss in contrary is 39 6 mm and is exceeded 99 of the time groundwater storage responds more rapidly to the seasonal water change than the tws and the sm significantly sustain the overall water storage the slope s qfs between 33 and 66 which represents the storage at 33rd and 66th percentiles are respectively 0 93 0 26 and 0 68 for the tws sm and gws the sm detains a higher water storage potential compared to the gws this evidence put together with its lower water loss 47 of the time confirms the fact that the unsaturated zone is more likely to stay wet as not only it is the first component to receive rainfall but also benefits water loss from aquifers gws the cumulative storage deficit eq 12 throughout a study period is computed to reveal the inter annual trends with the uptrend corresponding to the wet hydrological season and the dry season expressed by the downtrend from 2008 till 2015 there have been a wet hydrological uptrend in gws cumulative storage triggered by the rainfall which is conceived to master the water source for the terrestrial water storage the same patterns are pointed out in the four monitoring wells which span from 2004 to 2014 affon zou okpara and couffo sub basins and 2007 2014 couffo sub basin the cumulative storage deficits have reached respectively more than 500 316 372 and 169 with seasonal signals the period is preceded by a no trend period which extends from 2003 to late 2007 the wet period shows very little lag as the land storage components gws and sm respond almost at the same time with the rainfall signal after a dry hydrological season occurred till 2018 in the gws and sm with a lag of three years compared to the rainfall the precipitation cumulative storage deficit shows a second lag period extending from 2016 to 2018 during that period a new uptrend has occurred and brought the groundwater and soil moisture storage to a new high 4 3 3 gwr d supervised learning and prediction this section explains the analysis of the ability of the independent variables cf section 3 2 4 3 to reproduce groundwater change signals using machine learning technics the supervised classification models namely random forest extra trees regressor k neighbors regressor and decision tree were trained with 60 of the daily dataset and the remain is used to test each performance for the model s evaluation and comparison purpose six metrics eqs 14 19 such as the mean absolute error mae mean square error mse root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient r2 root mean squared logarithmic error rmsle and mean absolute percentage error mape were computed to measure models performance table 3 the extra trees regressor best fit the testing dataset in this case with a correlation coefficient of 0 92 and the lowest prediction errors followed by the random forest 0 88 k neighbors regressor 0 86 and decision tree 0 78 the overall performance reveals the relatively high accuracy of each model to contribute to groundwater hydrographs prediction in the study area figure 12 presents the prediction error for the extra trees regressor fig 12a the feature importance plot fig 12b and the prediction plot fig 12c and it turns out that the prediction correlation coefficient reaches 0 94 confirming the accuracy of the model and its usefulness to assess groundwater signals in areas where there is serious lack of groundwater fluctuation data according to the predictors importance plot fig 12b a change in groundwater storage signal is more likely to reflect on the vegetation canopy water content cw followed by the rainfall and the root zone soil moisture sm based on the metrics the lowest mae mse and rmse are attributed to the extra trees regressor respectively 0 39 mm 0 57 mm and 0 69 mm moreover the actual and predicted groundwater change gws accuracy has reached a correlation coefficient of 0 92 in this basement area the trained model can be useful to assess seasonal water table fluctuation and therefore empower the drinking water wells monitoring across the sector the less important predictors are grace derived products except the first order difference which represents a change in water level 5 discussion understanding the spatial and temporal patterns of groundwater has been at the center of several studies in recent times in this basement area of benin the need to assess aquifers resilience to drought and land cover change has become crucial to support water resources planning for better drinking water supply and allocation as an attempt to address this issue global hydrological models gldas and watergap remote sensing products trmm precipitation and grace tws esa land cover and in situ measurements were assessed to identify the land water storage dynamics and patterns in climatic fluxes across the basement area in benin below the 9th latitude even though the region witnesses four climatic seasons each year it turns out through this study that there are three land water storage seasons the first land water storage dry season matches the first climatic dry season which starts from january to march april for the soil moisture sm to april may for the tws and canopy water and to may june for the groundwater storage gws it should be noted that there is a kind of chronology in the terrestrial water storage components change which starts with sm then the tws canopy water and gws therefore a new hydrogeological season is launched firstly by the water storage change in the unsaturated zone which obviously increases the overall tws and affects the aquifers water table the single wet hydrogeological season takes the maximum time and covers the first rain season the smaller dry season around august and the second rain season which ends around october november these aforementioned analyses suggest that the reliable moment of the year to drill a borehole in this hard rock area is around march april as the land water storage generally is at its lowest during this period the probability to get a better discharge across the year is high and could provide more security for the borehole resilience to drought during that period observed sen s slope in averaged tws can reach 41 6 26 4 mm yr and consequently the wet season is noticeable in each component as shown in this study the first and second dry hydrogeological season have sen s slope values of respectively 29 1 17 7 mm yr and 53 7 31 6 mm yr and aligns with reported trends in past studies ndehedehe et al 2016b and zheng et al 2019 the second dry seasons drop is faster and confirms both the evidence found in the quantile function of storage qfs which reveals that the groundwater gws loss in this region occurred 57 of the time furthermore in the south of the 7th latitude specifically in the lower ou√©m√© catchment valley flood event occurs each year starting around september october moniod et al 1972 based on the strong water storage loss in the second dry hydrogeological season the flood events could benefit from water discharge in the surface water features although this might require thorough cases analysis changes in terrestrial water storage represent an interesting indicator of whether wells assigned for drinking supply are able to sustain the increasing water need and face climatic pressures e g drought within the study period two inter annual wet hydrological periods are noticed extending from 2006 to 2013 and 2016 2019 and characterized by respectively sen s slope values of 1 16 mm yr and 4 47 mm yr the past four years has seen an uptrend signal which is quite significant in the tws 4 47 mm yr gws 3 27 mm yr sm 0 93 mm yr cw 0 0005 mm yr and trmm precipitation 0 014 mm yr these resulst can be considered as a contribution to complement past studies undertaken at a lower or regional scale such as descroix et al 2009 ndehedehe et al 2016b ndehedehe 2019 blunden and arndt 2020 however because of spatial scale issues they should be interpreted with caution further soil moisture sm and canopy water components reveal a clear downtrend starting from 2008 through 2016 while evapotranspiration has persistently increased with the sen s slope value of 0 19 mm yr for sm and 0 0001 mm yr for canopy water during that period two land cover maps of the beginning and the ending are interpreted to check if the dry event is notice able in the vegetation cover dynamic based on the two esa sentinel 2 based lclu data there is a remarkable drop in the tree cover areas by 25 5 3086 7 sqkm an increase in the cropland and shrubs areas respectively 136 9 4847 7 sqkm and 69 6 1092 9 sqkm the vegetation areas losses in this central part of benin were also reported by oloukoi 2012 and lucas et al 2015 confirming the downtrend pattern identified in both canopy water and sm the pearson s correlation coefficient of tws versus evapotranspiration series 0 54 is a further proof of the probable relationship between the terrestrial water storage and climatic fluxes considering the groundwater storage change the pcc is 0 89 with the plant canopy water content canopy water 0 69 with precipitation and 0 79 with soil moisture these relatively strong and positive correlations are the evidence of the fact that water seepage through the unsaturated zone trigger surface and subsurface water storage components the multivariate analysis of gldas tws shows that the first and second pcs together account for 78 2 of the total variance with pc1 revealing the 4 trends noticed across the study period fig 3e and f the temporal pattern of pc2 is similar to the soil moisture sm and canopy water content series as the overall persistent dry period 2008 2016 is revealed in the retrieved signal during that same period the evapotranspiration has risen and this uptrend is depicted in the third pc 12 03 the fourth pc pattern is assimilated to the noise in the tws these decomposed sub domains of the gldas tws and grace tws are proved to give clues about both climatic and hydrologic parameters such as the precipitation ndehedehe et al 2021 zheng et al 2019 evapotranspiration ndehedehe et al 2018a 2018b soil moisture abiy and melesse 2017 groundwater d√∂ll et al 2014 and land water storage wahr et al 1998 on the other hand the principal component analysis is also applied to the watergap gws 21 6 18 3 kg m 2 and it turns out that pc1 and pc2 concentrates more than 99 of the total explained variance there is a strong and positive correlation coefficient pcc between pc1 versus tws 0 81 and gws 0 83 although pc2 is less correlated to these land storage components it gives a better correlation coefficient with precipitation 0 71 canopy water content 0 74 and gws 0 82 the lowest correlation coefficients are noticed with evapotranspiration which is hard to predict as the best values are respectively 0 54 and 0 55 for tws and gws however the overall picture shows that the pca is sufficiently efficient to identify the dominant and other important hydrological patterns in the watergap gws series to understand groundwater change regime and potential impacts on future land water d√∂ll et al 2014 herbert and d√∂ll 2019 regardless of the climatic zone rainfall change is generally confirmed to be an initiator of land water storage change though depending on climate complexity lags might occur in the patterns with the rainfall leading ndehedehe et al 2021 ferreira et al 2020 ndehedehe 2019 rodell et al 2018 zheng et al 2019 schwatke et al 2015 forootan et al 2014 tong et al 2006 for the purpose of evaluating the existing link the two series are compared using the pearson s correlation coefficient pcc the mean comparison t test and the linear dependency f test to find out the reciprocal influence that explain aquifers recharge and depletion in this basement area the calculated t statistic is 0 22 with the p value 0 82 greater than the 10 threshold which means that the null hypothesis of equal averages cannot be rejected for the rainfall change p versus groundwater storage change gws though the null hypothesis of equal averages is rejected for the daily precipitation versus the gws with p value smaller than the 1 threshold the confirmed similarity of the rainfall change p and groundwater storage change gws series is further proved 0 69 the highest negative change is 2 6 4 5 mm around april while the highest positive change occurred around october november and has reached 6 1 11 9 mm the aquifers system renewal in the area tends to be constant throughout the last decades but the year 2005 and 2015 are registered to be the poorest recharge periods as the daily average changes were negative respectively 0 13 1 1 mm and 0 15 1 1 mm the basement land water storage is further explored using the qfs to evaluate the behaviour of the water resources through each water budget component in fact soil moisture water gain is 53 probability of exceedance and stand for the proof that the unsaturated transition zone remains a water storage regulator between the groundwater gws table and plants root zone canopy water this finding corroborates the study by hector et al 2015 who affirmed that the surface mass variations linked to intra seasonal water storage change originate from heterogeneity in the vadose zone it is substantiated through qfs technique that aquifers in this basement area loose water storage faster fig 11a and have lower storage potential compared to sm this reality is portrayed in the four monitoring wells hydrographs mentioned in section 4 3 2 where the corresponding minimum water gain in the four monitoring wells which occurred at 99 probability of exceedance turned over at respectively 1 06 m 2 94 m 2 09 m and 1 12 m for the affon zou okpara and couffo sub basins additionally oussou et al 2020 raised the issue of the basement aquifers relatively low productivity and the complex spatial distribution of the boreholes discharge although major fracture orientations such as n10 n20 n90 n100 n170 n180 and others not negligible orientations combined with the cross point cp fracture density and coincidence map could lead to higher discharge groundwater areas the delicacy of the borehole implantation process in the area is then further recommended the present study also corroborates the groundwater potential analysis undertaken in the zou catchment located at the west of the study area oussou et al 2019 which compartmented the basin into 52 very low to moderate groundwater potential another work in alignment with the findings of this study is all√© 2019 who estimated the proportion of negative boreholes e g percentage of lost borehole during wells drilling to be around 40 and advocated consequently the use of a geophysical technique electrical tomography to amend groundwater prospection considering the monthly cumulative storage deficit sd the temporal pattern uncovers rainfall to be a primary source which regulates the tws components the pearson correlation coefficient of the monthly precipitation versus monitoring wells hydrographs postulate to these findings as the average value for the study area is 0 75 similar lag in the series has been reported over west africa ndehedehe et al 2016b nicholson et al 2003 and this pattern could be revealing of the fact that today land water storage is governed by a much more complex combination of past storages and climatic fluxes more recently a new wet season has brought the sd to new highs as the signal has been noticed since 2016 in the precipitation followed by both the gws and sm after a 2 year lag fig 11b due to limited data time span a fair comparison couldn t be made with the monitoring wells hydrographs though the water storage evaluation through in situ gravity measurements using the superconducting gravimeter has provided valuable insight on groundwater signals which is in alignment with some findings of this study hector et al 2015 2014 2013 hinderer et al 2012 the prediction feature importance plot shows that a change in groundwater storage is more likely to impact the canopy water content this evidence is confirmed by the computed pearson s correlation coefficient matrix fig 9 as the canopy water versus gws gives the second highest pcc 0 89 it appears as a considerable evidence that some vegetated areas might be a groundwater controlled or groundwater dependent ecosystems in fact the geological lithology from top to bottom is partitioned into three main zones namely weathered layer fractured zone and bedrock the groundwater in the weathered zone has the same characteristic like an unconfined aquifer depending on the percentage of clay therefore a drop in water table leaves the aquifers top without water causing water access and nutrient supplies unavailable to surface roots canadell et al 1996 schwinning 2010 and estrada medina et al 2012 cited by pierret et al 2016 the present study corroborates this fact and even though there is not a particular work undertaken in the area on plants rooting and groundwater freycon et al 2015 concluded that deep rooting could be common in african semi deciduous rain forests with a marked dry season based on these multiple lines of evidence the canopy water storage importance in the prediction might be a clue to further understanding the relationship between groundwater level change and plants rooting in this hard rock areas this evidence might also be attributed to anthropogenic actions expressed by the deforestation expansion of agricultural areas farmlands and population growth the four grace related predictors reveal that a change in the overall tws grace tws is more likely to indicate a groundwater level change than grace gtdi grace pc1 and grace tws respectively through this study the ml classification models are further proved to be a reliable tool to predict both groundwater storage and water table change in almost any climatic and hydrologic conditions fallah mehdipour et al 2013 sahoo et al 2017 el ibrahimi et al 2017 nhu et al 2020 qi and song 2020 6 conclusions the basement terrestrial water beneath the 9th latitude in benin is assessed through diverse spatial and temporal analysis of the global model and remote sensing products a set of findings about the basement aquifers is added to improve the state of knowledge provided till now by the limited existing gauge stations data from terrestrial water storage to climatic components the last two decades intra and inner annual hydrological regime patterns based on the tws gws sm cw precipitation and evapotranspiration have been evaluated to understand water resources availability it turns out that terrestrial water storage tws has gone through 4 hydrological periods from 2003 to 2019 2 wet and 2 dry and on the inner annual basis 3 seasons occurred each year 1 wet and 2 dry the boreholes discharge changes across the year are better explained and confirmed in the in situ measurement therefore the lower storage period should be considered by decision makers to plan future national water supply campaigns the storage mode analysis through qfs and sd provides further understanding about the aquifers as the gws lost water 57 of the time with a lower storage potential compared to the sm the application of the multivariate technique to assess variability in gldas tws grace tws and watergap gws has proved to be a valuable tool to retrieve hidden patterns be it climatic signal or terrestrial water related the comparative analysis of the groundwater storage change gws versus trmm based precipitation has shown that even though rainfall might be a primary source which triggers change in the aquifer water table the present day rainfall is less likely to affect the present groundwater storage the machine learning model et regressor performs best in the groundwater storage change prediction with the highest correlation coefficient and the lowest error the rate of unsuccessful boreholes in the study area has been for long time a challenging issue because of the basement aquifers complexity in benin but the findings from this study have shed some light on what is known for long time to be the most serious populations drinking water supply problem in these fractured aquifers some main results are summarized as followed the two wet hydrological seasons extended from 2006 to 2013 and 2016 2019 showing sen s slope values of 1 16 mm yr and 4 47 mm yr respectively but the two dry hydrological seasons indicated sen s slopes of 1 01 mm yr 2003 2006 and 1 19 mm yr 2013 2016 between 2004 and 2014 the in situ water table measurement increased by 1 44 mm yr 2 0 mm yr 3 2 mm yr and 0 56 mm yr within a year and unlike the 4 climatic seasons 3 hydrological seasons are noticed in tws changes the dry season january to april may 29 1 17 7 mm yr the wet season april may to october november 41 6 26 4 mm yr and the dry season november to december 53 7 31 6 mm yr the reliable moment of the year to drill a borehole in this hard rock area is around march april as the land water storage generally is at the lowest a persistent dry period from 2008 to 2016 has affected the unsaturated zone sm and the plant

8078,study region the seolmacheon experimental basin korea study focus to estimate the equivalent horton s ratios for channel network which are independent of the magnitude of threshold area or source basin area new hydrological insights for the region this paper aims to estimate the equivalent horton s ratios for a small experimental river basin in korea which are independent of the magnitude of threshold area or source basin area to this end various pattern of channel networks is extracted with the correspondence to the variable source basin area it turns out that the original horton s ratios are highly variable and sensitive to the scale of observation for channel networks nevertheless the combination of those such as the logarithmic rate between bifurcation ratio and area ratio might have a relatively constant trend implying scale invariance which could be considered as an avenue to horton s ratios independent of the source basin area thereby the equivalent horton s ratios could be regarded as the representative values for the basin of interest so that they can provide a reliable description of channel network regardless of the scale of observation it is confirmed that the scale invariance of channel network closely related to hortons ratios would be the result stemming from cooperation or competition between the elongation and expansion of channel network due to variable source basin area graphical abstract ga1 keywords channel network equivalent horton s ratios threshold area source basin area scale invariance 1 introduction in hydrology runoff generated on hillslope is generally routed through a channel network organized by interwoven individual channel segments so since horton s seminal work horton 1945 an approach to a drainage structure of river basin has been conducted mainly focusing on the shape of channel network strahler 1952 shreve 1966 smart 1972 especially advances in technology with digital elevation model dem for the past decades allows us to perform various systematic approaches to a drainage structure of river basin around channel network ijjasz vasquez and bras 1995 moussa and bocquillon 1996 moussa 2003 in which horton s law of drainage composition horton 1945 schumm 1956 has always taken a central place among those beer and borgas 1993 dodds and rothman 2000 peckham 1995 tarboton 1996 horton s law of drainage composition or more specifically horton s ratios is an empirical descriptor for the shape of channel networks by the association with strahler s stream ordering scheme strahler 1952 it can provide a simple and objective classification scheme of hierarchical network structure in this regard there can be found an interesting case study carried out by chen 2009 in which the similarity is identified between hierarchy of cities and topology of channel networks and then self organization trend of both systems is analyzed by using horton s ratios furthermore it has been well recognized that horton s ratios have a close relation to fractal dimension of complex structures typically exemplified by channel network la barbera and rosso 1989 rosso et al 1991 therefore it might be crucial to estimate accurate horton s ratios in order to describe the shape of channel networks and thereby to analyze their effects on hydrologic response of river basin rodr√≠guez iturbe and vald√©s 1979 rosso 1984 the reasonable estimation of horton s ratios prerequisites the reliable extent of channel network within a river basin since the concept of threshold area o callaghan and mark 1984 a variety of models have been proposed to generate prominent characteristics of natural channel network on the basis of dem ijjasz vasquez and bras 1995 montgomery and foufoula georgiou 1993 tarboton et al 1992 tarboton 2003 they can be classified into two distinct groups area threshold o callaghan and mark 1984 tarboton et al 1992 and slope area threshold ijjasz vasquez and bras 1995 montgomery and foufoula georgiou 1993 according to the criterion to distinguish channel pixels from hillslope pixels on dem the term area threshold or threshold area refers to the minimum support area to initiate channel head which can be thus interpreted as source basin area having no channel segment within its own territory previous researches kim and kim 2007 montgomery and foufoula georgiou 1993 tarboton et al 1988 present that there could appear a variety of channel networks for a single river basin depending on the models utilized for the identification of channel network especially kim and kim 2007 point out that not even any pair of those channel networks matches each other exactly they just share a similar shape they insist that the main difference among those comes from the magnitude of threshold area or source basin area however a quantitative definition has not been reached yet at the scale of source basin area or headwater basin area jaeger et al 2007 montgomery and dietrich 1989 moreover it has been widely known that the morphometric properties of river basins such as horton s ratios are intensely affected by the selection of threshold area claps and oliveto 1996 da ros and borgas 1997 moussa 2008a 2008b concerning this issue a series of interesting researches has been mainly conducted by moussa moussa and bocquillon 1996 moussa 2008a 2008b 2009 moussa and bocquillon 1996 establish the relationships of the number of sources main channel length and total length of channel network to threshold area applied to dem within the framework of scale invariance based on those formulation moussa 2008a 2008b explains the bifurcation process of channel network and its effect on drainage structure of river basin such as width function in terms of the variable source basin area especially moussa 2009 proposes the equivalent relations to horton s ratios by combining the bifurcation process of channel network stemming from the variation of source basin area with horton s law of drainage composition the most important feature of those relations is the nature of independence on threshold area or source basin area so that we could have the more stable descriptors for the shape of the channel network regardless of the scale of observation however even though moussa 2009 emphasizes scale invariant properties of those equivalent relations an explicit linkage of which to fractal dimension are not given in his own results this motivates us in that due to the inherent nature of those descriptors we could find the explicit connections of fractal dimension with the equivalent relations suggested by moussa 2009 accordingly recently kim and jung 2021 apply the methodologies proposed by moussa 2008a 2008b to a river basin in korea in which they find out that the decrease of source basin area causes the bifurcation process of channel network in the river basin resulting in the expansion and elongation of channel network simultaneously this could be regarded as evidence for the source basin area to be a useful working tool for geomorphologic analysis on the drainage structure of the river basin therefore in this study we apply the framework of equivalent horton s ratios based on variable source basin area suggested by moussa 2009 to the river basin in korea this is intended to estimate horton s ratios being independent of threshold area or source basin area and thereby to approach a fundamental drainage structure of river basin with respect to scale invariance since most hydrologic practices in korea are frequently concerned with small and middle scale of river basins our case study is performed on one of the small experimental basins operated in korea it is the same study site exploited by kim and jung 2021 mentioned above which is called the seolmacheon experimental basin it is noted that the seolmacheon experimental basin has been seldom developed during the last century because of its geopolitical location between south and north korea and can be thus regarded in a mostly natural status in addition there are several gaging stations for the monitoring of the rainfall runoff process in the basin of interest so that they can provide useful information for the sake of future researches about geomorphologic effect on the transformation process of rainfall into runoff this is the main reason for us to choose it as a study site 2 theoretical background 2 1 horton s law of drainage composition strahler s stream ordering scheme strahler 1952 has been well known for assigning the topology of channel networks the followings summarize its main idea channels that originate at a source are defined to be the first order streams when two streams of order œâ join a stream of order œâ 1 is generated when two streams of different order join the channel segment immediately downstream has the higher order of the two combining streams once the topology of a channel network with the highest order being œâ is assigned according to strahler s stream ordering scheme horton s law of drainage composition horton 1945 schumm 1956 can be defined by 1 r b n œâ 1 n œâ n œâ n œâ r b œâ œâ 2 r l l œâ l œâ 1 l œâ l œâ r l œâ œâ 3 r a a œâ a œâ 1 a œâ a œâ r a œâ œâ where r b r l and r a refer to bifurcation length and area ratio respectively with n œâ l œâ and a œâ being the number average length and average drainage area of the œâ th order stream respectively it is also well known that horton s ratios in eq 1 to eq 3 are intimately related to fractal dimensions of channel network la babera and rosso 1989 suggest a relation of fractal dimension d n based on horton s law of drainage composition 4 d n ln r b ln r l eq 4 indicates a scaling behavior of channel network in that linear channel segments organize a kind of network structure in order to fully drain a planar basin by bifurcation process furthermore rosso et al 1991 propose another fractal dimension for channel segment d l in terms of horton s law of drainage composition 5 d l 2 ln r l ln r a where d l quantifies sinuosity of individual channel segments therefore fractal dimension of channel network as a whole d can be expressed by tarboton et al 1988 6 d d l d n 2 ln r b ln r a 2 2 bifurcation process of channel network in applying a series of threshold area s to a dem for a single river basin with drainage area of a various pattern of channel networks would manifest with the correspondence to s the variable shape of channel networks resulted in could be quantified by the number of sources Œº and total length of channels z moussa and bocquillon 1996 7 Œº s a œà s a 8 z s a a 1 2 —Ñ s a the left hand side of eq 7 and eq 8 represents Œº and z respectively under the condition that a river basin with drainage area of a has the mean source basin area of s in addition œà and —Ñ in the right hand side of eq 7 and eq 8 are the dimensionless functions with respect to s a devised by moussa and bocquillon 1996 according to eq 7 and eq 8 the first bifurcation process of channel network can be characterized by 9 s 0 Œµ max s Œº s a 2 10 Œº s 0 a 1 11 z s 0 a a 1 2 —Ñ s 0 a l 0 where s 0 in eq 9 refers to the minimum of s in order for only one channel segment to exist in the basin subject to eq 10 while Œµ in eq 9 is the decrement of s which brings about the first bifurcation process of channel network furthermore l 0 in eq 11 stands for the length of single channel segment to meet the condition of s s 0 within the framework of scale invariance moussa 2008a 2008b formulates œà in eq 7 into 12 Œº s a Œª s a Œ± where Œª and Œ± are in turn the proportional constant and exponent in order for eq 7 to be a power function in that a bifurcation process of channel network could be modelled as scale invariant one with respect to variation of s thereby the variation of z can be expressed by 13 z s Œ¥ s a z s a Œº s Œ¥ s a z s Œ¥ s s where Œ¥ s is the change of s and thus the second term in the right hand side of eq 13 indicates the increment of z it is noted that the variation of Œº reflects the lengthening of existing channel segments as well as generation of new sources the derivative of z z can be derived on the basis of eq 8 14 z s a lim Œ¥ s 0 z s Œ¥ s a z s a Œ¥ s a 1 2 —Ñ s a 15 z s s lim Œ¥ s 0 z s Œ¥ s s z s s Œ¥ s s 1 2 —Ñ 1 eq 14 and eq 15 account for the variation of z due to Œ¥ s within the whole river basin and source basin respectively in which —Ñ 1 is the differential coefficient at s a 1 therefore combining eq 13 to eq 15 can give rise to the derivative of —Ñ in eq 8 under the condition of z s s 0 16 —Ñ s a Œª —Ñ 1 s a Œ± 1 2 by integrating eq 16 the complete form of eq 8 can be resulted in 17 —Ñ s a Œª —Ñ 1 Œ± 1 2 s a Œ± 1 2 c z where c z is an integration constant in order for —Ñ to be continuous around the first bifurcation process imposing eq 11 on eq 17 gives a constraint 18 a 1 2 Œª —Ñ 1 Œ± 1 2 l 0 a 1 2 c z a s 0 Œ± 1 2 finally the general relations of z and c z can be derived by substituting eq 18 into eq 17 19 z s a l 0 a 1 2 c z s s 0 Œ± 1 2 a 1 2 c z 20 c z l 0 s s 0 Œ± 1 2 z s a a 1 2 s s 0 Œ± 1 2 a 1 2 moussa 2008a 2008b regards c z to be a shape index taking account into the bifurcation process of channel network in that the increase of c z with the decrease of s indicates the elongation of the channel network while the decrease of c z along with the decrease of s represents the contraction of the channel network 2 3 equivalent horton s ratios if assuming a channel network to be a tree in the same topology according to strahler s stream ordering scheme and then pruning branches by each stream order œâ successively a series of source basin area s œâ and Œº can be expressed by moussa 2009 21 s œâ 2 a œâ 22 Œº s œâ a œâ Œº 2 a œâ a œâ n œâ 1 based on eq 1 to eq 3 with the association of eq 21 and eq 22 Œº and z can be reformulated corresponding to eq 12 and eq 19 respectively within the framework of horton s law of drainage composition 23 Œº s œâ a œâ n œâ r b 1 2 ln r b ln r a 2 a œâ a œâ ln r b ln r a 24 z s œâ a œâ n œâ l œâ r b r l 1 1 2 ln r b ln r l ln r a 2 a œâ a œâ ln r b ln r l ln r a n œâ l œâ r b r l 1 under the assumption of scale invariance for eq 19 with c z in eq 20 being constant two pairs of relations for Œº and z get to be correspondent each other comparing each pair of those leads to the relations for the exponent 25 Œ± ln r b ln r a 26 Œ± 1 2 ln r b ln r l ln r a ln r l ln r a 1 2 in addition the relations for the proportional constant can be also resulted in 27 Œª a Œ± n œâ r b 1 2 a œâ ln r b ln r a 28 l 0 a 1 2 c z s 0 Œ± 1 2 n œâ l œâ r b r l 1 1 2 a œâ ln r b ln r l ln r a based on eq 27 with the consideration of a œâ a and n œâ 1 the equivalent relations with eq 1 to eq 3 can be derived through eq 25 and eq 26 moussa 2009 chavan and srinivas 2015 29 r be 2 Œ± Œª 30 r le 2 Œ± Œª 1 2 Œ± 31 r ae 2 Œ± Œª 1 Œ± moussa 2009 defines r be r le and r ae in eq 29 to eq 31 as the equivalent horton s ratios and points out that they are independent of s by the similar rationale the relation being equivalent to l œâ can be also derived through eq 28 32 l œâ e l 0 a 1 2 c z 2 a s 0 Œ± 1 2 r be r le 1 due to the property of r be and r le it is clear that l œâ e can be regarded as the characteristic length of channel network independent of s 3 methodology 3 1 study site our study site is the seolmacheon experimental basin located in the middle west of korean peninsula it is one of the small mountainous tributary basins with drainage area of about 8 5 km2 running into the imjin river which flows through the border between south and north korea the seolmacheon experimental basin is geologically composed of the gyeonggi gneiss of the precambrian period it belongs to a typical mountainous region with the proportion of forest being about 77 in which the mean elevation and slope are 171 66 m above the mean sea level and 15 79 respectively it can be characterized by a continental climate with the annual average temperature and precipitation being 10 2 and 1391 2 mm respectively fig 1 is a drainage map of the seolmacheon experimental basin with its outlet at the upper left corner jjb the channel network depicted in fig 1 comes from the digital terrain map by korean national geographic information institute ngii at the scale of 1 25 000 it can be seen that the highest stream order is two from a simple visual inspection on the topology of channel network in fig 1 following strahler s stream ordering scheme a dem for the basin of interest is generated in the resolution of 20 20 m by using the digital terrain map of ngii mentioned above taudem tarboton 2003 operated on arcmap is utilized to manipulate dem and construct flow path by eight flow direction method 3 2 preliminary research result as the preliminary research for the basin of interest we construct fig 2 which shows the first bifurcation process of the seolmacheon experimental basin with s 0 0 9904 km 2 Œµ 0 0096 km 2 and l 0 5 166 km according to eq 9 to eq 11 it can be expected that there occurs no bifurcation process of channel network in the basin of interest under the condition of s s 0 so that only a single channel segment continues to grow up upstream as s decreases fig 3 and fig 4 demonstrate the successive bifurcation processes induced by the decrease of source basin area for œâ 2 and œâ 3 respectively in which there occur a generation of new sources as well as the lengthening of channel segments as s decreases it can be figured out that the decrease of source basin area causes the bifurcation process of channel network resulting in the increase of Œº the expansion of channel network and the increase of z the elongation of channel network simultaneously in addition it can be also observed that various shape of channel networks can appear due to variable source basin area even at the same topologic level or the highest order œâ of channel network in a single river basin therefore it might be crucial to consider the accurate information about source basin for the sake of determining the reliable extent of channel network on dem table 1 lists s max and s min for the channel networks which are successively extracted by applying the selected various s until the basin of interest is ultimately fulfiled by the channel network with the possibly maximum œâ being six to facilitate geomorphologic analysis s is selected likely to be evenly spaced on double logarithmic paper in the range of s s 0 with the minimum of s being 400 m2 area of single pixel total number of the selected s is 102 and thereby all of 102 channel networks are classified by œâ according to strahler s stream ordering scheme s max and s min in table 1 can be thus interpreted as the interval of the mean source basin area for each œâ from table 1 it can be seen that s 0 in fig 2 a corresponds to s min for œâ 1 while s 0 Œµ in fig 2 b is s max for œâ 2 3 3 fractal relation to source basin area based on eq 29 to eq 31 an interrelation between three equivalent horton s ratios r be r le and r ae can be expressed through Œ± as eq 33a 33a r be r le 2 Œ± r ae Œ± 33b r b r l d n r a d 2 eq 33b is a relationship between the original horton s ratios r b r l and r a suggested by yang and paik 2017 eq 33 implies that there would exist a constraint imposed by fractal property on the possible shape of channel network which can be reflected by horton s ratios in this context d n can be expressed by comparing eq 33a and eq 33b 34 d n 2 Œ± it can be seen that eq 34 is inconsistent with eq 25 it is due to the restriction of ln r l ln r a 1 2 in eq 26 which implies the lack of sinuosity for the individual channel segments d l 1 so r le in eq 30 could be thought of as more similar to another length ratio r l rather than r l in eq 2 within the framework of horton s law of drainage composition peckham 1995 35 r l l œâ l œâ 1 r l r l d l where l œâ is the average straight line length between the both ends of the œâ th order stream by substituting eq 35 into eq 33b a modified interrelation between the original horton s ratios and fractal relation consistent with eq 33a can be derived as follow 36 r b r l d n r l d r a d 2 37 d 2 Œ± this study tries to analyze geomorphologic features of the basin of interest within the framework of variable source basin area focusing on equivalent horton s ratios and to verify its validity through a case study 4 results and discussion 4 1 scale invariance of channel network fig 5 shows the relations of Œº s a and z s a with s a for the 102 channel networks of the basin of interest presented in section 3 2 in which the numbers inserted into this figure denote œâ in table 1 it is noted that both of those curves could be classified into several characteristic regimes in terms of s a at first the middle part of two curves œâ 3 and œâ 4 shows a relatively linear trend on double logarithmic paper implying scale invariance subject to eq 12 and eq 19 however the elongation trend of channel network implicitly embedded in fig 2 is still dominant along the decrease of s a in the tail part of two curves that is z s a increases nonlinearly on double logarithmic paper even though Œº s a remains to be unity for œâ 1 while Œº s a increases irregularly with the nonlinear increase of z s a on double logarithmic paper for œâ 2 moreover two curves in the vicinity of the origin œâ 5 and œâ 6 are in the shape of inverted s and especially z s a for œâ 5 and œâ 6 shows a distinct increasing trend than the middle part of those curve for œâ 3 and œâ 4 in fig 5 b table 2 details the relation of Œº s a with s a depicted in fig 5 a where the symbol œâ indicates the plotted points falling in the range being less than or equal to œâ in fig 5 a so each regression discriminated by œâ is sought to get a relation in the form of eq 12 for the channel network undergoing successive bifurcation processes along with the decrease of s excepting the points without any bifurcation process belonging to the range of œâ 1 furthermore d in the final column of table 2 is estimated by eq 37 based on d in table 2 we can infer that the shape of channel network for the seolmacheon experimental basin tends to be transformed from a linear one into planar one as bifurcation process goes on this can be also confirmed from fig 5 in the case of œâ 1 and œâ 2 as lower s a the increase of z s a the elongation of channel network might be prevailed over the increase of Œº s a the expansion of channel network to result in the shape of channel network closer to linear one however as s a decreases in the range of œâ 5 and œâ 6 the increase of Œº s a the expansion of channel network would overwhelm the increase of z s a the elongation of channel network causing d to exceed two unrealistic value for two dimensional space therefore as kim and jung 2021 already point out the bifurcation process of channel network induced by variable source basin area could be represented by two entities the elongation of channel network and the expansion of channel network this terminology could be utilized interchangeably with the contraction of channel network used by moussa 2008a 2008b in that both of them represent the relative dominance of the increase of Œº s a over the increase of z s a it can be thus seen that the scale invariance trend apparent for œâ 3 and œâ 4 in fig 5 would be the result of fluvial trails which stems from cooperation or competition between the elongation and expansion of channel network due to variable source basin area so in the remaining part of this paper we discard the channel networks belonging to the range of œâ 5 and œâ 6 in fig 5 due to that they could contain not only channel network but also drainage path network on hillslope 4 2 shape index of channel network as presented in section 2 2 eq 19 depends on eq 12 especially in order for eq 19 to be scale invariant shape index c z should be constant therefore we investigate the behavior of c z with respect to s a by using eq 20 with the estimates of Œ± for œâ 2 to œâ 4 in table 2 fig 6 shows the variation of c z with respect to s a in which the numbers inserted into this figure denote œâ in table 1 in similar to fig 5 it can be seen that each case of c z has the different domains of s a due to the distinct regressions in table 2 with Œ± appropriate to the corresponding cases moreover the inset in fig 6 is intended to represent the case for œâ 2 where c z has the value one order of magnitude less than the ones for œâ 3 and œâ 4 it can be clearly observed from fig 6 that c z for all of three cases tends to increase as s a decreases for the range of œâ 2 along with part of œâ 3 being indicative of the elongation of channel network as suggested by moussa 2008a 2008b however in the case of œâ 3 c z shows the small fluctuation around the relatively constant value 2 11 within the range of 0 0057 s a 0 0175 the remaining part of œâ 3 furthermore c z in the case of œâ 4 also shows the small variation around the relatively constant value 0 73 within the range of 0 0010 s a 0 0175 the remaining part of œâ 3 along with œâ 4 thereby the latter two cases could be thought of as the evidence for scale invariance of the channel network with respect to variable source basin area for which eq 12 and eq 19 are hold at the same time whereas the former case could be inferred to indicate separate geologic controls influencing the shape of channel network such as the tectonic relief on ground surface 4 3 equivalent horton s ratios by considering the specific ranges of s a depicted in fig 6 which indicate scale invariance for the cases of œâ 3 and œâ 4 respectively we estimate three equivalent horton s ratios r be r le and r ae and equivalent characteristic length l œâ e of channel network for the basin of interest by using eq 29 to eq 32 table 3 lists those estimates for each case fig 7 shows the variation of horton s ratios with respect to s a for the 102 channel networks of the basin of interest presented in section 3 2 in which the solid line represents the corresponding equivalent values in table 3 for the case of œâ 4 while the dashed line is the ones in table 3 for the case of œâ 3 in similar to the previous sections the numbers inserted into this figure denote œâ in table 1 especially it should be noted that we plot r l instead of r l in fig 7 c and l œâ instead of l œâ in fig 7 d in order to verify eq 36 from fig 7 it can be observed that all of horton s ratios are highly variable and sensitive to s a and show a discontinuous and cyclic fashion of variation by œâ moussa 2008a 2008b defines s a as the scale of observation for channel network in that different values of s could result in substantially distinct channel networks for the same river basin consequently it turns out that horton s ratios are strongly affected by the selection of s as depicted in fig 7 nevertheless it is interesting that r b in fig 7 a shows a similar variation trend to r a in fig 7 b in despite of that the former is related to topologic property of channel network whereas the latter to the scale property this can be therefore interpreted that although individual values of r b and r a could be highly variable with respect to s a their combination such as the logarithmic rate between those might have a relatively constant trend implying scale invariance in this context we can consider eq 25 to be an avenue to horton s ratios independent of the scale of observation for channel network which can provide the representative values of those such as equivalent horton s ratios meanwhile it is also noted that l œâ in fig 7 d has only a few fixed values except the range of œâ 1 which has no bifurcation process the number of the fixed values for l œâ is five for the basin of interest it can be easily expected that this is the same case for l œâ even though l œâ and l œâ have been generally treated as the characteristic length of channel network in hydrology it is hard to find an explicit scaling relation of those to s a rather besides the range of œâ 1 it can be observed that a certain value of l œâ 2 878 km corresponding l œâ 4 949 km appears for almost cases in every stream order it might be due to the nature of strahler s stream ordering scheme by comparing the original horton s ratios and corresponding two equivalent ones in fig 7 a to fig 7 c the estimates for the case of œâ 4 solid line could be considered as the representative values for the basin of interest if excepting the range of œâ 1 in fig 7 d it is noticed that though l œâ e for the case of œâ 3 has the closer value to the most frequent l œâ than the one for the case of œâ 4 the difference between those is amount to be just 332 m therefore we can be sure that the equivalent horton s ratios for the case of œâ 4 in table 3 can provide the reliable description of channel network for the basin of interest regardless of the scale of observation for channel network 4 4 modified length ratio as seen in the last section r le tends to be more similar to r l rather than r l as reflected in eq 36 and eq 37 it requires to accommodate sinuosity of individual channel segments to eq 30 to this end we estimate d l within the framework of eq 35 fig 8 shows the regression of r l with r l for the 35 channel networks falling in the range of 0 0010 s a 0 0175 specified in fig 6 and then table 4 lists the estimate of d l and the modified equivalent length ratio r le by eq 35 to verify table 4 we estimate d l in a separate way by assuming scaling relations of z s a and the corresponding straight line length z s a following tarboton et al 1988 38 z s a s a Œ≤ 39 z s a s a Œ≥ where z s a is total length of channel network which consists of each channel segment being a straight line fig 9 shows the variation of z s a and z s a with respect to s a for the 35 channel networks as presented above in which the ratio of two exponents d l Œ≥ Œ≤ has the value of 1 0973 very similar to the one in table 4 so we can be sure that fig 8 and table 4 can give the reasonable estimates for the channel network in the basin of interest in similar to fig 7 fig 10 demonstrates the validity of r le to r l for the 102 channel networks of the basin of interest 4 5 further discussion on the extent of channel network following the results presented in the previous sections we can think of that the possible extent of channel network reaches at the stream order of four in the seolmacheon experimental basin moreover scale invariance property might be only prominent for the channel networks extracted from the specific range of s a depicted in fig 6 it can be also easily seen that the channel network blue line depicted in fig 1 has the similar shape to the second order channel networks in fig 3 usually channel networks such as blue line in fig 1 are built on the basis of the field survey so it can be reasonable to regard those to be the extent of perennial channel network it is also well known that the fluvial trail of channel network follows random walk of runoff aggregation rodriguez iturbe et al 1992 to cause scale invariance such as fractal properties presented in our results in this context for the seolmacheon experimental basin the scale invariance properties of channel network due to variable source basin area are likely to occur beyond the extent of perennial channel network as point out by feng et al 2020 so it can be thought of that the shape of perennial channel network in the basin of interest blue line in fig 1 could be attributed to geologic controls of the study site which is closely related to the tectonic relief on ground surface as mentioned before while the scale invariance present in the higher order channel network might be due to the random walk behavior of fluvial flow courses in other words for the basin of interest there may exist many drainage pathways on its hillslope sides which couldn t form the well defined channels in the dry seasons whereas in the rainy seasons they could form the ephemeral channel network around the perennial one following random walk of runoff aggregation therefore the possible extent of channel network can go beyond the extent of perennial channel network stemming from the bifurcation process due to variable source basin area the remaining part of the basin of interest corresponds to the drainage path network on hillslope which ultimately fulfils the inner space of basin the above statements imlpy that the seolmacheon experimental basin could have separate hydrologic responses to precipitation by seasons furthermore it is well known that korea has four distinct seasons to result in variable hydrologic conditions so the results of this study can be useful information to account for time variant and nonlinear hydrologic response characteristics of the basin of interest within the framework of basin geomorphology 5 conclusions the followings are the noteworthy results from this study 1 the scale invariance of the channel network would be the result of fluvial trails stemming from cooperation or competition between the elongation and expansion of channel network due to variable source basin area 2 although horton s ratios are highly variable and sensitive to the scale of observation for channel networks the combination of those might have a relatively constant trend implying scale invariance which could be considered as an avenue to horton ratios independent of the source basin area 3 the equivalent horton s ratios could be considered as the representative values for the basin of interest so that they can provide a reliable description of the channel network regardless of the scale of observation for the channel network 4 for the case of the seolmacheon experimental basin the shape of the perennial channel network could be attributed to geologic controls of the study site which is closely related to the tectonic relief on a ground surface while the scale invariance present in the higher order channel network might be due to the random walk behavior of fluvial flow courses 5 further researches may be required on the other basins in different circumstances such as climate geology and vegetation in order to more

8078,study region the seolmacheon experimental basin korea study focus to estimate the equivalent horton s ratios for channel network which are independent of the magnitude of threshold area or source basin area new hydrological insights for the region this paper aims to estimate the equivalent horton s ratios for a small experimental river basin in korea which are independent of the magnitude of threshold area or source basin area to this end various pattern of channel networks is extracted with the correspondence to the variable source basin area it turns out that the original horton s ratios are highly variable and sensitive to the scale of observation for channel networks nevertheless the combination of those such as the logarithmic rate between bifurcation ratio and area ratio might have a relatively constant trend implying scale invariance which could be considered as an avenue to horton s ratios independent of the source basin area thereby the equivalent horton s ratios could be regarded as the representative values for the basin of interest so that they can provide a reliable description of channel network regardless of the scale of observation it is confirmed that the scale invariance of channel network closely related to hortons ratios would be the result stemming from cooperation or competition between the elongation and expansion of channel network due to variable source basin area graphical abstract ga1 keywords channel network equivalent horton s ratios threshold area source basin area scale invariance 1 introduction in hydrology runoff generated on hillslope is generally routed through a channel network organized by interwoven individual channel segments so since horton s seminal work horton 1945 an approach to a drainage structure of river basin has been conducted mainly focusing on the shape of channel network strahler 1952 shreve 1966 smart 1972 especially advances in technology with digital elevation model dem for the past decades allows us to perform various systematic approaches to a drainage structure of river basin around channel network ijjasz vasquez and bras 1995 moussa and bocquillon 1996 moussa 2003 in which horton s law of drainage composition horton 1945 schumm 1956 has always taken a central place among those beer and borgas 1993 dodds and rothman 2000 peckham 1995 tarboton 1996 horton s law of drainage composition or more specifically horton s ratios is an empirical descriptor for the shape of channel networks by the association with strahler s stream ordering scheme strahler 1952 it can provide a simple and objective classification scheme of hierarchical network structure in this regard there can be found an interesting case study carried out by chen 2009 in which the similarity is identified between hierarchy of cities and topology of channel networks and then self organization trend of both systems is analyzed by using horton s ratios furthermore it has been well recognized that horton s ratios have a close relation to fractal dimension of complex structures typically exemplified by channel network la barbera and rosso 1989 rosso et al 1991 therefore it might be crucial to estimate accurate horton s ratios in order to describe the shape of channel networks and thereby to analyze their effects on hydrologic response of river basin rodr√≠guez iturbe and vald√©s 1979 rosso 1984 the reasonable estimation of horton s ratios prerequisites the reliable extent of channel network within a river basin since the concept of threshold area o callaghan and mark 1984 a variety of models have been proposed to generate prominent characteristics of natural channel network on the basis of dem ijjasz vasquez and bras 1995 montgomery and foufoula georgiou 1993 tarboton et al 1992 tarboton 2003 they can be classified into two distinct groups area threshold o callaghan and mark 1984 tarboton et al 1992 and slope area threshold ijjasz vasquez and bras 1995 montgomery and foufoula georgiou 1993 according to the criterion to distinguish channel pixels from hillslope pixels on dem the term area threshold or threshold area refers to the minimum support area to initiate channel head which can be thus interpreted as source basin area having no channel segment within its own territory previous researches kim and kim 2007 montgomery and foufoula georgiou 1993 tarboton et al 1988 present that there could appear a variety of channel networks for a single river basin depending on the models utilized for the identification of channel network especially kim and kim 2007 point out that not even any pair of those channel networks matches each other exactly they just share a similar shape they insist that the main difference among those comes from the magnitude of threshold area or source basin area however a quantitative definition has not been reached yet at the scale of source basin area or headwater basin area jaeger et al 2007 montgomery and dietrich 1989 moreover it has been widely known that the morphometric properties of river basins such as horton s ratios are intensely affected by the selection of threshold area claps and oliveto 1996 da ros and borgas 1997 moussa 2008a 2008b concerning this issue a series of interesting researches has been mainly conducted by moussa moussa and bocquillon 1996 moussa 2008a 2008b 2009 moussa and bocquillon 1996 establish the relationships of the number of sources main channel length and total length of channel network to threshold area applied to dem within the framework of scale invariance based on those formulation moussa 2008a 2008b explains the bifurcation process of channel network and its effect on drainage structure of river basin such as width function in terms of the variable source basin area especially moussa 2009 proposes the equivalent relations to horton s ratios by combining the bifurcation process of channel network stemming from the variation of source basin area with horton s law of drainage composition the most important feature of those relations is the nature of independence on threshold area or source basin area so that we could have the more stable descriptors for the shape of the channel network regardless of the scale of observation however even though moussa 2009 emphasizes scale invariant properties of those equivalent relations an explicit linkage of which to fractal dimension are not given in his own results this motivates us in that due to the inherent nature of those descriptors we could find the explicit connections of fractal dimension with the equivalent relations suggested by moussa 2009 accordingly recently kim and jung 2021 apply the methodologies proposed by moussa 2008a 2008b to a river basin in korea in which they find out that the decrease of source basin area causes the bifurcation process of channel network in the river basin resulting in the expansion and elongation of channel network simultaneously this could be regarded as evidence for the source basin area to be a useful working tool for geomorphologic analysis on the drainage structure of the river basin therefore in this study we apply the framework of equivalent horton s ratios based on variable source basin area suggested by moussa 2009 to the river basin in korea this is intended to estimate horton s ratios being independent of threshold area or source basin area and thereby to approach a fundamental drainage structure of river basin with respect to scale invariance since most hydrologic practices in korea are frequently concerned with small and middle scale of river basins our case study is performed on one of the small experimental basins operated in korea it is the same study site exploited by kim and jung 2021 mentioned above which is called the seolmacheon experimental basin it is noted that the seolmacheon experimental basin has been seldom developed during the last century because of its geopolitical location between south and north korea and can be thus regarded in a mostly natural status in addition there are several gaging stations for the monitoring of the rainfall runoff process in the basin of interest so that they can provide useful information for the sake of future researches about geomorphologic effect on the transformation process of rainfall into runoff this is the main reason for us to choose it as a study site 2 theoretical background 2 1 horton s law of drainage composition strahler s stream ordering scheme strahler 1952 has been well known for assigning the topology of channel networks the followings summarize its main idea channels that originate at a source are defined to be the first order streams when two streams of order œâ join a stream of order œâ 1 is generated when two streams of different order join the channel segment immediately downstream has the higher order of the two combining streams once the topology of a channel network with the highest order being œâ is assigned according to strahler s stream ordering scheme horton s law of drainage composition horton 1945 schumm 1956 can be defined by 1 r b n œâ 1 n œâ n œâ n œâ r b œâ œâ 2 r l l œâ l œâ 1 l œâ l œâ r l œâ œâ 3 r a a œâ a œâ 1 a œâ a œâ r a œâ œâ where r b r l and r a refer to bifurcation length and area ratio respectively with n œâ l œâ and a œâ being the number average length and average drainage area of the œâ th order stream respectively it is also well known that horton s ratios in eq 1 to eq 3 are intimately related to fractal dimensions of channel network la babera and rosso 1989 suggest a relation of fractal dimension d n based on horton s law of drainage composition 4 d n ln r b ln r l eq 4 indicates a scaling behavior of channel network in that linear channel segments organize a kind of network structure in order to fully drain a planar basin by bifurcation process furthermore rosso et al 1991 propose another fractal dimension for channel segment d l in terms of horton s law of drainage composition 5 d l 2 ln r l ln r a where d l quantifies sinuosity of individual channel segments therefore fractal dimension of channel network as a whole d can be expressed by tarboton et al 1988 6 d d l d n 2 ln r b ln r a 2 2 bifurcation process of channel network in applying a series of threshold area s to a dem for a single river basin with drainage area of a various pattern of channel networks would manifest with the correspondence to s the variable shape of channel networks resulted in could be quantified by the number of sources Œº and total length of channels z moussa and bocquillon 1996 7 Œº s a œà s a 8 z s a a 1 2 —Ñ s a the left hand side of eq 7 and eq 8 represents Œº and z respectively under the condition that a river basin with drainage area of a has the mean source basin area of s in addition œà and —Ñ in the right hand side of eq 7 and eq 8 are the dimensionless functions with respect to s a devised by moussa and bocquillon 1996 according to eq 7 and eq 8 the first bifurcation process of channel network can be characterized by 9 s 0 Œµ max s Œº s a 2 10 Œº s 0 a 1 11 z s 0 a a 1 2 —Ñ s 0 a l 0 where s 0 in eq 9 refers to the minimum of s in order for only one channel segment to exist in the basin subject to eq 10 while Œµ in eq 9 is the decrement of s which brings about the first bifurcation process of channel network furthermore l 0 in eq 11 stands for the length of single channel segment to meet the condition of s s 0 within the framework of scale invariance moussa 2008a 2008b formulates œà in eq 7 into 12 Œº s a Œª s a Œ± where Œª and Œ± are in turn the proportional constant and exponent in order for eq 7 to be a power function in that a bifurcation process of channel network could be modelled as scale invariant one with respect to variation of s thereby the variation of z can be expressed by 13 z s Œ¥ s a z s a Œº s Œ¥ s a z s Œ¥ s s where Œ¥ s is the change of s and thus the second term in the right hand side of eq 13 indicates the increment of z it is noted that the variation of Œº reflects the lengthening of existing channel segments as well as generation of new sources the derivative of z z can be derived on the basis of eq 8 14 z s a lim Œ¥ s 0 z s Œ¥ s a z s a Œ¥ s a 1 2 —Ñ s a 15 z s s lim Œ¥ s 0 z s Œ¥ s s z s s Œ¥ s s 1 2 —Ñ 1 eq 14 and eq 15 account for the variation of z due to Œ¥ s within the whole river basin and source basin respectively in which —Ñ 1 is the differential coefficient at s a 1 therefore combining eq 13 to eq 15 can give rise to the derivative of —Ñ in eq 8 under the condition of z s s 0 16 —Ñ s a Œª —Ñ 1 s a Œ± 1 2 by integrating eq 16 the complete form of eq 8 can be resulted in 17 —Ñ s a Œª —Ñ 1 Œ± 1 2 s a Œ± 1 2 c z where c z is an integration constant in order for —Ñ to be continuous around the first bifurcation process imposing eq 11 on eq 17 gives a constraint 18 a 1 2 Œª —Ñ 1 Œ± 1 2 l 0 a 1 2 c z a s 0 Œ± 1 2 finally the general relations of z and c z can be derived by substituting eq 18 into eq 17 19 z s a l 0 a 1 2 c z s s 0 Œ± 1 2 a 1 2 c z 20 c z l 0 s s 0 Œ± 1 2 z s a a 1 2 s s 0 Œ± 1 2 a 1 2 moussa 2008a 2008b regards c z to be a shape index taking account into the bifurcation process of channel network in that the increase of c z with the decrease of s indicates the elongation of the channel network while the decrease of c z along with the decrease of s represents the contraction of the channel network 2 3 equivalent horton s ratios if assuming a channel network to be a tree in the same topology according to strahler s stream ordering scheme and then pruning branches by each stream order œâ successively a series of source basin area s œâ and Œº can be expressed by moussa 2009 21 s œâ 2 a œâ 22 Œº s œâ a œâ Œº 2 a œâ a œâ n œâ 1 based on eq 1 to eq 3 with the association of eq 21 and eq 22 Œº and z can be reformulated corresponding to eq 12 and eq 19 respectively within the framework of horton s law of drainage composition 23 Œº s œâ a œâ n œâ r b 1 2 ln r b ln r a 2 a œâ a œâ ln r b ln r a 24 z s œâ a œâ n œâ l œâ r b r l 1 1 2 ln r b ln r l ln r a 2 a œâ a œâ ln r b ln r l ln r a n œâ l œâ r b r l 1 under the assumption of scale invariance for eq 19 with c z in eq 20 being constant two pairs of relations for Œº and z get to be correspondent each other comparing each pair of those leads to the relations for the exponent 25 Œ± ln r b ln r a 26 Œ± 1 2 ln r b ln r l ln r a ln r l ln r a 1 2 in addition the relations for the proportional constant can be also resulted in 27 Œª a Œ± n œâ r b 1 2 a œâ ln r

derived through eq 25 and eq 26 moussa 2009 chavan and srinivas 2015 29 r be 2 Œ± Œª 30 r le 2 Œ± Œª 1 2 Œ± 31 r ae 2 Œ± Œª 1 Œ± moussa 2009 defines r be r le and r ae in eq 29 to eq 31 as the equivalent horton s ratios and points out that they are independent of s by the similar rationale the relation being equivalent to l œâ can be also derived through eq 28 32 l œâ e l 0 a 1 2 c z 2 a s 0 Œ± 1 2 r be r le 1 due to the property of r be and r le it is clear that l œâ e can be regarded as the characteristic length of channel network independent of s 3 methodology 3 1 study site our study site is the seolmacheon experimental basin located in the middle west of korean peninsula it is one of the small mountainous tributary basins with drainage area of about 8 5 km2 running into the imjin river which flows through the border between south and north korea the seolmacheon experimental basin is geologically composed of the gyeonggi gneiss of the precambrian period it belongs to a typical mountainous region with the proportion of forest being about 77 in which the mean elevation and slope are 171 66 m above the mean sea level and 15 79 respectively it can be characterized by a continental climate with the annual average temperature and precipitation being 10 2 and 1391 2 mm respectively fig 1 is a drainage map of the seolmacheon experimental basin with its outlet at the upper left corner jjb the channel network depicted in fig 1 comes from the digital terrain map by korean national geographic information institute ngii at the scale of 1 25 000 it can be seen that the highest stream order is two from a simple visual inspection on the topology of channel network in fig 1 following strahler s stream ordering scheme a dem for the basin of interest is generated in the resolution of 20 20 m by using the digital terrain map of ngii mentioned above taudem tarboton 2003 operated on arcmap is utilized to manipulate dem and construct flow path by eight flow direction method 3 2 preliminary research result as the preliminary research for the basin of interest we construct fig 2 which shows the first bifurcation process of the seolmacheon experimental basin with s 0 0 9904 km 2 Œµ 0 0096 km 2 and l 0 5 166 km according to eq 9 to eq 11 it can be expected that there occurs no bifurcation process of channel network in the basin of interest under the condition of s s 0 so that only a single channel segment continues to grow up upstream as s decreases fig 3 and fig 4 demonstrate the successive bifurcation processes induced by the decrease of source basin area for œâ 2 and œâ 3 respectively in which there occur a generation of new sources as well as the lengthening of channel segments as s decreases it can be figured out that the decrease of source basin area causes the bifurcation process of channel network resulting in the increase of Œº the expansion of channel network and the increase of z the elongation of channel network simultaneously in addition it can be also observed that various shape of channel networks can appear due to variable source basin area even at the same topologic level or the highest order œâ of channel network in a single river basin therefore it might be crucial to consider the accurate information about source basin for the sake of determining the reliable extent of channel network on dem table 1 lists s max and s min for the channel networks which are successively extracted by applying the selected various s until the basin of interest is ultimately fulfiled by the channel network with the possibly maximum œâ being six to facilitate geomorphologic analysis s is selected likely to be evenly spaced on double logarithmic paper in the range of s s 0 with the minimum of s being 400 m2 area of single pixel total number of the selected s is 102 and thereby all of 102 channel networks are classified by œâ according to strahler s stream ordering scheme s max and s min in table 1 can be thus interpreted as the interval of the mean source basin area for each œâ from table 1 it can be seen that s 0 in fig 2 a corresponds to s min for œâ 1 while s 0 Œµ in fig 2 b is s max for œâ 2 3 3 fractal relation to source basin area based on eq 29 to eq 31 an interrelation between three equivalent horton s ratios r be r le and r ae can be expressed through Œ± as eq 33a 33a r be r le 2 Œ± r ae Œ± 33b r b r l d n r a d 2 eq 33b is a relationship between the original horton s ratios r b r l and r a suggested by yang and paik 2017 eq 33 implies that there would exist a constraint imposed by fractal property on the possible shape of channel network which can be reflected by horton s ratios in this context d n can be expressed by comparing eq 33a and eq 33b 34 d n 2 Œ± it can be seen that eq 34 is inconsistent with eq 25 it is due to the restriction of ln r l ln r a 1 2 in eq 26 which implies the lack of sinuosity for the individual channel segments d l 1 so r le in eq 30 could be thought of as more similar to another length ratio r l rather than r l in eq 2 within the framework of horton s law of drainage composition peckham 1995 35 r l l œâ l œâ 1 r l r l d l where l œâ is the average straight line length between the both ends of the œâ th order stream by substituting eq 35 into eq 33b a modified interrelation between the original horton s ratios and fractal relation consistent with eq 33a can be derived as follow 36 r b r l d n r l d r a d 2 37 d 2 Œ± this study tries to analyze geomorphologic features of the basin of interest within the framework of variable source basin area focusing on equivalent horton s ratios and to verify its validity through a case study 4 results and discussion 4 1 scale invariance of channel network fig 5 shows the relations of Œº s a and z s a with s a for the 102 channel networks of the basin of interest presented in section 3 2 in which the numbers inserted into this figure denote œâ in table 1 it is noted that both of those curves could be classified into several characteristic regimes in terms of s a at first the middle part of two curves œâ 3 and œâ 4 shows a relatively linear trend on double logarithmic paper implying scale invariance subject to eq 12 and eq 19 however the elongation trend of channel network implicitly embedded in fig 2 is still dominant along the decrease of s a in the tail part of two curves that is z s a increases nonlinearly on double logarithmic paper even though Œº s a remains to be unity for œâ 1 while Œº s a increases irregularly with the nonlinear increase of z s a on double logarithmic paper for œâ 2 moreover two curves in the vicinity of the origin œâ 5 and œâ 6 are in the shape of inverted s and especially z s a for œâ 5 and œâ 6 shows a distinct increasing trend than the middle part of those curve for œâ 3 and œâ 4 in fig 5 b table 2 details the relation of Œº s a with s a depicted in fig 5 a where the symbol œâ indicates the plotted points falling in the range being less than or equal to œâ in fig 5 a so each regression discriminated by œâ is sought to get a relation in the form of eq 12 for the channel network undergoing successive bifurcation processes along with the decrease of s excepting the points without any bifurcation process belonging to the range of œâ 1 furthermore d in the final column of table 2 is estimated by eq 37 based on d in table 2 we can infer that the shape of channel network for the seolmacheon experimental basin tends to be transformed from a linear one into planar one as bifurcation process goes on this can be also confirmed from fig 5 in the case of œâ 1 and œâ 2 as lower s a the increase of z s a the elongation of channel network might be prevailed over the increase of Œº s a the expansion of channel network to result in the shape of channel network closer to linear one however as s a decreases in the range of œâ 5 and œâ 6 the increase of Œº s a the expansion of channel network would overwhelm the increase of z s a the elongation of channel network causing d to exceed two unrealistic value for two dimensional space therefore as kim and jung 2021 already point out the bifurcation process of channel network induced by variable source basin area could be represented by two entities the elongation of channel network and the expansion of channel network this terminology could be utilized interchangeably with the contraction of channel network used by moussa 2008a 2008b in that both of them represent the relative dominance of the increase of Œº s a over the increase of z s a it can be thus seen that the scale invariance trend apparent for œâ 3 and œâ 4 in fig 5 would be the result of fluvial trails which stems from cooperation or competition between the elongation and expansion of channel network due to variable source basin area so in the remaining part of this paper we discard the channel networks belonging to the range of œâ 5 and œâ 6 in fig 5 due to that they could contain not only channel network but also drainage path network on hillslope 4 2 shape index of channel network as presented in section 2 2 eq 19 depends on eq 12 especially in order for eq 19 to be scale invariant shape index c z should be constant therefore we investigate the behavior of c z with respect to s a by using eq 20 with the estimates of Œ± for œâ 2 to œâ 4 in table 2 fig 6 shows the variation of c z with respect to s a in which the numbers inserted into this figure denote œâ in table 1 in similar to fig 5 it can be seen that each case of c z has the different domains of s a due to the distinct regressions in table 2 with Œ± appropriate to the corresponding cases moreover the inset in fig 6 is intended to represent the case for œâ 2 where c z has the value one order of magnitude less than the ones for œâ 3 and œâ 4 it can be clearly observed from fig 6 that c z for all of three cases tends to increase as s a decreases for the range of œâ 2 along with part of œâ 3 being indicative of the elongation of channel network as suggested by moussa 2008a 2008b however in the case of œâ 3 c z shows the small fluctuation around the relatively constant value 2 11 within the range of 0 0057 s a 0 0175 the remaining part of œâ 3 furthermore c z in the case of œâ 4 also shows the small variation around the relatively constant value 0 73 within the range of 0 0010 s a 0 0175 the remaining part of œâ 3 along with œâ 4 thereby the latter two cases could be thought of as the evidence for scale invariance of the channel network with respect to variable source basin area for which eq 12 and eq 19 are hold at the same time whereas the former case could be inferred to indicate separate geologic controls influencing the shape of channel network such as the tectonic relief on ground surface 4 3 equivalent horton s ratios by considering the specific ranges of s a depicted in fig 6 which indicate scale invariance for the cases of œâ 3 and œâ 4 respectively we estimate three equivalent horton s ratios r be r le and r ae and equivalent characteristic length l œâ e of channel network for the basin of interest by using eq 29 to eq 32 table 3 lists those estimates for each case fig 7 shows the variation of horton s ratios with respect to s a for the 102 channel networks of the basin of interest presented in section 3 2 in which the solid line represents the corresponding equivalent values in table 3 for the case of œâ 4 while the dashed line is the ones in table 3 for the case of œâ 3 in similar to the previous sections the numbers inserted into this figure denote œâ in table 1 especially it should be noted that we plot r l instead of r l in fig 7 c and l œâ instead of l œâ in fig 7 d in order to verify eq 36 from fig 7 it can be observed that all of horton s ratios are highly variable and sensitive to s a and show a discontinuous and cyclic fashion of variation by œâ moussa 2008a 2008b defines s a as the scale of observation for channel network in that different values of s could result in substantially distinct channel networks for the same river basin consequently it turns out that horton s ratios are strongly affected by the selection of s as depicted in fig 7 nevertheless it is interesting that r b in fig 7 a shows a similar variation trend to r a in fig 7 b in despite of that the former is related to topologic property of channel network whereas the latter to the scale property this can be therefore interpreted that although individual values of r b and r a could be highly variable with respect to s a their combination such as the logarithmic rate between those might have a relatively constant trend implying scale invariance in this context we can consider eq 25 to be an avenue to horton s ratios independent of the scale of observation for channel network which can provide the representative values of those such as equivalent horton s ratios meanwhile it is also noted that l œâ in fig 7 d has only a few fixed values except the range of œâ 1 which has no bifurcation process the number of the fixed values for l œâ is five for the basin of interest it can be easily expected that this is the same case for l œâ even though l œâ and l œâ have been generally treated as the characteristic length of channel network in hydrology it is hard to find an explicit scaling relation of those to s a rather besides the range of œâ 1 it can be observed that a certain value of l œâ 2 878 km corresponding l œâ 4 949 km appears for almost cases in every stream order it might be due to the nature of strahler s stream ordering scheme by comparing the original horton s ratios and corresponding two equivalent ones in fig 7 a to fig 7 c the estimates for the case of œâ 4 solid line could be considered as the representative values for the basin of interest if excepting the range of œâ 1 in fig 7 d it is noticed that though l œâ e for the case of œâ 3 has the closer value to the most frequent l œâ than the one for the case of œâ 4 the difference between those is amount to be just 332 m therefore we can be sure that the equivalent horton s ratios for the case of œâ 4 in table 3 can provide the reliable description of channel network for the basin of interest regardless of the scale of observation for channel network 4 4 modified length ratio as seen in the last section r le tends to be more similar to r l rather than r l as reflected in eq 36 and eq 37 it requires to accommodate sinuosity of individual channel segments to eq 30 to this end we estimate d l within the framework of eq 35 fig 8 shows the regression of r l with r l for the 35 channel networks falling in the range of 0 0010 s a 0 0175 specified in fig 6 and then table 4 lists the estimate of d l and the modified equivalent length ratio r le by eq 35 to verify table 4 we estimate d l in a separate way by assuming scaling relations of z s a and the corresponding straight line length z s a following tarboton et al 1988 38 z s a s a Œ≤ 39 z s a s a Œ≥ where z s a is total length of channel network which consists of each channel segment being a straight line fig 9 shows the variation of z s a and z s a with respect to s a for the 35 channel networks as presented above in which the ratio of two exponents d l Œ≥ Œ≤ has the value of 1 0973 very similar to the one in table 4 so we can be sure that fig 8 and table 4 can give the reasonable estimates for the channel network in the basin of interest in similar to fig 7 fig 10 demonstrates the validity of r le to r l for the 102 channel networks of the basin of interest 4 5 further discussion on the extent of channel network following the results presented in the previous sections we can think of that the possible extent of channel network reaches at the stream order of four in the seolmacheon experimental basin moreover scale invariance property might be only prominent for the channel networks extracted from the specific range of s a depicted in fig 6 it can be also easily seen that the channel network blue line depicted in fig 1 has the similar shape to the second order channel networks in fig 3 usually channel networks such as blue line in fig 1 are built on the basis of the field survey so it can be reasonable to regard those to be the extent of perennial channel network it is also well known that the fluvial trail of channel network follows random walk of runoff aggregation rodriguez iturbe et al 1992 to cause scale invariance such as fractal properties presented in our results in this context for the seolmacheon experimental basin the scale invariance properties of channel network due to variable source basin area are likely to occur beyond the extent of perennial channel network as point out by feng et al 2020 so it can be thought of that the shape of perennial channel network in the basin of interest blue line in fig 1 could be attributed to geologic controls of the study site which is closely related to the tectonic relief on ground surface as mentioned before while the scale invariance present in the higher order channel network might be due to the random walk behavior of fluvial flow courses in other words for the basin of interest there may exist many drainage pathways on its hillslope sides which couldn t form the well defined channels in the dry seasons whereas in the rainy seasons they could form the ephemeral channel network around the perennial one following random walk of runoff aggregation therefore the possible extent of channel network can go beyond the extent of perennial channel network stemming from the bifurcation process due to variable source basin area the remaining part of the basin of interest corresponds to the drainage path network on hillslope which ultimately fulfils the inner space of basin the above statements imlpy that the seolmacheon experimental basin could have separate hydrologic responses to precipitation by seasons furthermore it is well known that korea has four distinct seasons to result in variable hydrologic conditions so the results of this study can be useful information to account for time variant and nonlinear hydrologic response characteristics of the basin of interest within the framework of basin geomorphology 5 conclusions the followings are the noteworthy results from this study 1 the scale invariance of the channel network would be the result of fluvial trails stemming from cooperation or competition between the elongation and expansion of channel network due to variable source basin area 2 although horton s ratios are highly variable and sensitive to the scale of observation for channel networks the combination of those might have a relatively constant trend implying scale invariance which could be considered as an avenue to horton ratios independent of the source basin area 3 the equivalent horton s ratios could be considered as the representative values for the basin of interest so that they can provide a reliable description of the channel network regardless of the scale of observation for the channel network 4 for the case of the seolmacheon experimental basin the shape of the perennial channel network could be attributed to geologic controls of the study site which is closely related to the tectonic relief on a ground surface while the scale invariance present in the higher order channel network might be due to the random walk behavior of fluvial flow courses 5 further researches may be required on the other basins in different circumstances such as climate geology and vegetation in order to more

8079,study region the huangfuchuan basin on the loess plateau china study focus runoff and the sediment load of the yellow river in china have received substantial attention owing to their marked declines over recent decades climate change and intensive anthropogenic activities soil and water conservation measures on the loess plateau are regarded as the main factors responsible for the dramatic declines thus attribution analysis on the roles of such influencing factors is important for the sustainable management in this study annual scale variations of runoff and sediment load of a typical watershed undergoing intensive change were simulated using three regression algorithms the impacts of climate change namely precipitation and temperature and anthropogenic activities namely channel measures check dam construction and slope measures terracing afforestation grass planting and closures on runoff and sediment load variations were quantified continuously for the period 1954 2015 new hydrological insights for the region results indicated that the main climate change factor was precipitation reduction which was attributed to 35 and 34 of runoff reduction and sediment load reduction respectively channel measures caused 32 and 39 of runoff reduction and sediment load reduction respectively whereas slope measures caused 33 and 27 of runoff reduction and sediment load reduction respectively we recommend that further implications of soil and water conservation measures be studied carefully on the loess plateau keywords water reduction sediment reduction machine learning conservation measures loess plateau attribution analysis 1 introduction the loess plateau of china universally known for its severe soil erosion extends over a large area 640 000 km2 of the upper and middle reaches of the yellow river basin fu et al 2017 he et al 2006 shi and shao 2000 the considerable loss of soil on the loess plateau has led to high sediment load of the yellow river 1 6 gt year 1 before the 1950s risk of land degradation threat to sustainability of the entire ecosystem and widespread socioeconomic concern li et al 2017 2016 wang et al 2016 to mitigate the severe soil erosion on the loess plateau many soil and water conservation practices were adopted in previous decades which can be classified broadly as either channel measures or slope measures liu 2016 channel measures include construction of dams and reservoirs in gullies and river channels whereas slope measures include terracing grass planting afforestation and closure measures to promote revegetation on slopes fu et al 2017 liu 2016 following implementation of soil and water conservation practices on the loess plateau the sediment load and runoff of the yellow river decreased by 0 02 gt year 1 and 0 25 km3 year 1 respectively from the 1950s to the 2010s wang et al 2016 however the substantial reduction in runoff has aggravated water shortages in the yellow river and severely restricted local socioeconomic development yang et al 2004 to guarantee water security for the regional ecosystem and local socioeconomic development it is crucial to quantify precisely the impacts of both climate change and soil and water conservation measures on runoff and sediment load variations on the loess plateau boix fayos et al 2007 kondolf et al 2014 zhao et al 2018 diverse methods such as statistical regression methods elastic methods and physical numerical models have been applied to address this issue kong et al 2016 statistical methods such as simple linear regression and the double mass curve method which are among the techniques used most commonly usually divide a time series into baseline and changing periods and establish the relationship between precipitation and discharge sediment load using long term historical data to detect the effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities gao et al 2017 2016 zhao et al 2018 elastic methods applied to the loess plateau are usually based on the budyko framework which considers both water and energy constraints in hydrological processes over the long term budyko and mif al tirgume ha mada 1963 marlatt et al 1975 wu et al 2017a most statistical regression methods and elastic methods which are lumped and easily applicable ignore spatial heterogeneity and assume uniformity of hydrological variables and parameters in an entire basin gao et al 2017 tian et al 2016 zhao et al 2014 physical hydrological models developed recently are usually distributed and have finer temporal and spatial resolutions ferro and porto 2000 jiao et al 2017 yang et al 2000 such models apply varying parameters for the different meshes and simulate and predict site specific variations over different time scales de vente et al 2013 liu et al 2006 2019 lu et al 2020 various physical models have been built or applied to discover the principles of hydrological variation such as swat li et al 2017 gbhm cong et al 2009 lu et al 2020 yang et al 2000 vic chang et al 2015 and dyrim shi et al 2016 however it is not easy to overcome their limitations including complex model structures large numbers of input datasets time costs and uncertainty in model calibration and validation gao et al 2016 moreover nonphysical processes such as parameter calibration are still required for most physical models wu et al 2018 xu et al 2013 in addition to the inherent shortcomings outlined above such models have two universal limitations in attribution research period division and multiple factor decomposition in assessment of the hydrological response to climate change and anthropogenic activities most studies divide the hydrological time series into two or more periods based on change point detection ma et al 2014 shi and wang 2015 the first period is taken as the baseline or reference period during which very limited or no substantial anthropogenic activities occur the second period is considered as the changing period during which the watershed experiences marked changes in land use dam construction and afforestation deforestation gao et al 2017 tian et al 2016 zhao et al 2014 the change point detection method is an efficient and scientific approach to identify the division between the baseline and changing periods previous related studies have applied various change detection methods to analyze the statistical features of long term hydrological time series tang et al 2013 zhao et al 2015b methods commonly used to detect change points include the sequential mann kendall test double mass curve pettitt test and accumulative anomaly method aam kendall 1948 mann 1945 wang et al 2012 wu et al 2017a however period division can introduce considerable uncertainty wu et al 2017b for the same watershed or even the same hydrological sequence results based on change points obtained in different studies can be markedly different taking the runoff sequence of the huangfuchuan basin hfc in the middle reaches of the yellow river as an example the abrupt change point has been identified as 1979 zhou et al 2015 1984 shi and wang 2015 and 1996 tian et al 2016 nevertheless attribution analysis based on period division assumes that the entire basin is unaffected by anthropogenic activities during the baseline period whereas it is considered affected by anthropogenic activities to the same degree every year throughout the changing period which limits the nuance of quantitative results zhao et al 2018 2014 most traditional statistical regression methods and elastic coefficient methods cannot separate the effects of specific soil and water conservation measures zhao et al 2018 the physical models that do not include an anthropogenic activity module conduct the same attribution analysis procedure as mentioned above chang et al 2015 wu et al 2018 the few models that do include such a module merely consider the impact of certain soil and water conservation measures liu et al 2019 lu et al 2020 shi et al 2019 which are generally not comprehensive and increase the inherent structural complexity and computational cost lu et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 only a few models integrate the impact of terrace construction which is an important component of soil and water conservation practices in china fu et al 2017 liu 2016 machine learning models work well in finding complicated relationships between different influencing factors mitchell 1997 among the various machine learning algorithms linear regression is the simplest but the most interpretable freedman 2009 in a study of the luanhe river basin in north china li et al 2014 applied multilinear regression to detect the relations between annual runoff and influencing factors that included precipitation urban area water area unused area and agricultural area and they successfully identified the main factor attributed to annual runoff reduction to address the aforementioned issues in this study we proposed a regression model family using carefully selected features and fitting algorithms for analysis of runoff and sediment load variations and skipped the period division procedure in quantifying the impact of precipitation temperature and major types of soil and water conservation practice namely channel measures and slope measures data quality and fitting methods determine the result of attribution analysis based on the regression model the loess plateau has experienced dramatic changes over past decades chen et al 2015 wang et al 2016 and the proportion of outliers in the time series is considerable furthermore input features should be considered carefully based on collinearity and correlation 2 material and methods 2 1 study sites the huangfuchuan river which is a first order tributary of the yellow river s middle reaches originates on the ordos plateau and discharges into the yellow river in fugu county shaanxi province fig 1 it has total length of 137 km and its watershed covers an area of 3246 km2 the watershed is located in a transition zone between desert grassland and the loess plateau and it has a typical semiarid continental climate the mean annual temperature in the basin is 6 2 7 2 increasing from northwest to southeast average annual precipitation is approximately 380 420 mm concentrated mainly during june september zhao et al 2018 according to records from huangfu station which is the control hydrological station at the basin outlet annual mean runoff and annual mean sediment yield between 1954 and 2015 were approximately 125 million m3 and 39 million tons respectively severe soil erosion contributed to the high sediment concentration in the yellow river over a long period wei et al 2017 zhao et al 2015a however since the 1970 s a series of soil and water conservation measures have been implemented for example check dam construction in channels and slope measures such as afforestation grass planting and terracing fu et al 2017 as a consequence of the conservation measures and climate change both runoff and sediment load have decreased substantially in recent decades chen et al 2015 wang et al 2016 2 2 datasets daily runoff and sediment load data from 1954 to 2015 were obtained from the huangfu station and converted to the annual scale by summation or averaging precipitation observation data were obtained from the hydrology bureau of the yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources precipitation data from 1954 to 2015 were collected from the 15 rainfall stations distributed uniformly within the area fig 1 and annual mean precipitation was calculated by applying the inverse distance weighting method shepard 1968 daily meteorological data were collected from hequ station which is the closest national meteorological station to the huangfu hydrological station and shares similar elevation the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi reflects vegetation status we obtained ndvi data from the avhrr ndvi 3 g v1 0 product provided as part of nasa s global inventory monitoring and modeling system the dataset starts in 1982 has a half monthly time step and 1 12 spatial resolution which is equivalent to 8 km information regarding check dams which was obtained from a general survey of water resources and the administration of the yellow river s middle reaches included details of the construction time total storage capacity and control area of each dam data regarding soil and water conservation measures were collected from the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc the annual scale data series was produced from multisource data including field investigation data of small watersheds statistics of soil and water conservation measures interpretation of remote sensing imagery verification and analysis of typical sample areas mathematical statistics and expert consultation data information relating to the datasets collected for use in this study is listed in table 1 2 3 methodologies we built an integrated framework for attribution analysis on runoff and sediment variation fig 2 presents a flowchart of the simulation and analysis methods embedded within the developed framework 2 3 1 data processing data processing is performed to extract and reconstruct features from the original data analyze the correlations of features between themselves and with runoff and sediment load and explore the set of features that provides the optimum balance 1 feature extraction scale transition is undertaken to transform data with various time scales to the annual scale as shown in table 1 linear combination is adopted to reconstruct new features on the basis of the collected data and understanding of hydrological processes we produced a composite slope feature index a slope to represent the degree of slope measures implemented to reduce runoff and sediment load 1 a slope Œ± g a grass Œ± f a forest Œ± t a terrace Œ± c a closure where a i is the conservation area of the i th type of slope measure and Œ± i is the corresponding runoff reduction modulus sediment reduction modulus for runoff the ratio was estimated as Œ± g Œ± f Œ± t Œ± c 0 7 0 8 1 0 0 2 while for sediment it was set to Œ± g Œ± f Œ± t Œ± c 0 9 0 9 1 0 0 2 wang and fan 2002 input normalization is performed to conduct a min max normalization procedure before performing the regression it is necessary because the existence of different units and ranges among the input data can influence the results as shown in eq 2 2 x y max y min x x min x max x min y min where x is the original input data and x min and x max are the minimum and maximum values of x respectively y min and y max are the lower and upper bounds of the normalized data in this study the normalized output result x was constrained to the range of 1 1 therefore y min and y max are set as 1 and 1 respectively 2 feature selection correlation analysis is performed to select those features that have strong correlation with runoff and sediment load adding the types of input data increasing the number of dimensions certainly enhances the simulation performance for the training set but it tends to decrease the applicability and interpretability of the trained model moreover the problem of overfitting can never be ignored collinearity analysis is undertaken to determine the feature set that has weaker collinearity for linear regression models the existence of collinearity between explanatory variables distorts model estimations and greatly reduces model interpretability therefore it is crucial to calculate the correlation between features and to construct input features reasonably and carefully before model development the pearson correlation coefficient which is adopted as the vital basis for data selection can be calculated as follows 3 r x y cov x y var x var y the pairs that contain null value are skipped since data periods are different 2 3 2 linear regression 1 model selection it is very difficult to develop a satisfactory model for the hfc owing to the limitation on data size and quality in addition to the marked and persistent changes within the basin we tested three linear regression algorithms ordinary least squares ordinary ridge regression ridge and lasso regression lasso and selected the optimal method for further attribution analysis freedman 2009 in a linear regression model the i th sample x i y i in the training set includes the input vector x i x 1 i x 2 i x p i where x i r p and the corresponding target value y i r the target value y i is expected to be a linear combination of the elements in x i such that the predicted value y ÀÜ i can be calculated using the following equation 4 y ÀÜ i w b x i w 1 x 1 i w p x p i b where w w 1 w 2 w p is a parameter vector and b is a scalar both of which can be learned from the training set 2 3 2 1 ordinary linear regression ordinary ordinary linear regression aims to minimize the residual sum of squares between n observed targets y i and the predicted targets y ÀÜ i via linear approximation where n is the size of the input training data the loss function to minimize can be expressed as follows 5 min w b 1 n i 1 n y ÀÜ i y i 2 2 3 2 2 ridge regression ridge different from ordinary regression ridge regression can solve partial problems of ordinary least squares by imposing a penalty on the size of the coefficients the ridge coefficients minimize a penalized residual sum of squares 6 min w b 1 n i 1 n y ÀÜ i y i 2 Œ± w 2 2 where Œ± is a constant and w 2 2 is the l 2 norm of the parameter vector w the complexity parameter Œ± 0 controls the amount of shrinkage that is as the value of Œ± increases the amount of shrinkage increases and thus the coefficients become more robust to collinearity 2 3 2 3 lasso regression lasso the lasso is a linear model that estimates sparse coefficients it is useful in certain contexts owing to its tendency to prefer solutions with fewer non zero coefficients effectively reducing the number of features upon which the given solution is dependent for this reason lasso and its variants are fundamental to the field of compressed sensing under certain conditions it can recover the exact set of non zero coefficients mathematically it consists of a linear model with an added regularization term the objective function to minimize can be expressed as follows 7 min w b 1 n i 1 n y ÀÜ i y i 2 Œ± w 1 the lasso estimate thus solves the minimization of the least squares penalty with Œ± w 1 added where Œ± is a constant and w 1 is the l 1 norm of the parameter vector w 2 model evaluation we aimed to skip the period division process through addition of the indices of anthropogenic activities and thus build a regression model suitable for the entire period because of the limited sample size the training and testing sets in the different divisions did not have stable distributions which led to fluctuation in model performance therefore repetition was necessary for model evaluation we performed random sample division 100 times and trained and tested each model to reduce the impact of randomness thoroughly ascertain the potential performance of each model and assess the capability of each model more comprehensively the training set and the verification set comprised 80 and 20 of the samples respectively the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient which is used commonly in evaluation of the results of hydrological models was adopted as the index with which to assess the machine learning model s simulation for both the training and the testing sets the nse value for the training set reflects the empirical risk of the model while the nse score for the testing set reflects the prediction capability of the model the generalization capability of the model is decided based on the model s combined scores for the two sets the nse coefficient can be calculated as follows 8 nse 1 i 1 n o i m i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where m i is the model simulations o i is the observations o is the average of the observations and n is the total number of observations 2 3 3 attribution analysis machine learning has a powerful capability for data mining and relationship exploration with careful feature selection based on physical understanding it is possible to use a trained model to explore the influence of multiple features on complicated hydrological changes the attribution rate of the selected features causing runoff and sediment load changes in the hfc is expressed as follows 9 ar i w i x i j 1 p w j x j where ar i is the attribution rate of i th factor p is the number of features and x i is the difference of the i th factor between two periods for the combined factor a slope we conducted decomposition to obtain the attribution rates of the different slope measures the decomposition function is expressed as follows 10 ar i Œ± i a i Œ± g a grass Œ± f a forest Œ± t a terrace Œ± c a closure ar slope i grass forest terrace closure where the meaning of symbols is the same as in eqs 1 and 9 the features finally determined for attribution analysis are listed in table 2 3 results 3 1 feature selection in this study input features for machine learning were selected according to physical understanding and correlation analysis of runoff and sediment load and their potential influencing factors in the hfc the annual scale correlation coefficients among all the normalized time series data are shown in fig 3 the three meteorological features of precipitation temperature and relative humidity were the main factors influencing runoff and sediment load precipitation had the strongest positive correlation with both runoff and sediment load with coefficients of 0 66 and 0 58 respectively temperature also played an important role in the variations of runoff and sediment load that is the correlation coefficient with runoff and sediment load was 0 22 and 0 25 respectively changes caused by anthropogenic activities are indicated by the cumulative control area and storage capacity of check dams ndvi areas of forests grass terraces closures and integrated slope measures the correlation coefficients of the cumulative control area of check dams with runoff and sediment load were 0 54 and 0 52 respectively and those of the cumulative storage capacity were 0 51 and 0 49 respectively the two features of check dams had strong self correlation and the correlation of control area with hydrological changes was larger than storage thus the cumulative control area of check dams was taken as the representative feature of channel measures and applied in further analysis additionally the correlation coefficients of ndvi with runoff and sediment load were 0 38 and 0 39 respectively the features of the slope measures had strong inner correlation most values were 0 9 and relatively obvious negative correlation with both runoff and sediment although terracing grass planting afforestation and closures are independent features their variation has significant correlation thus we selected the calculated comprehensive slope area to represent the feature of slope measures therefore the input features selected for building the machine learning models were precipitation temperature cumulative control area of check dams and comprehensive slope area table 2 the temporal variation patterns of the selected variables are illustrated in fig 4 the period of achannel was shorter than 1960 2015 the values between 1960 and 1970 were assumed as zeros since the first check dam documented in the hfc built in 1972 while the values between 2012 and 2015 are the linear extents on the values between 2010 and 2012 3 2 regression results three linear regression algorithms were applied to construct the models for simulation of the annual runoff and sediment load of the hfc we trained and tested the models using 100 groups of datasets obtained by random division the nse value was calculated for assessment of the simulation and prediction capabilities of the models fig 5 for all models the simulation capability on the training set was reasonably robust whereas the prediction accuracy on the test set fluctuated remarkably in particular runoff training was more robust than sediment load training moreover the fitting performance of both training and testing of runoff was better than that of sediment load in comparison with the original and lasso algorithms ridge got slight smaller accuracy in training than the other two methods but obtained better testing results for both runoff and sediment load fig 5 the runoff model performances were original nse train 0 70 0 04 nse test 0 51 0 29 ridge nse train 0 65 0 06 nse test 0 55 0 20 lasso nse train 0 70 0 04 nse test 0 53 0 25 the sediment model performances were original nse train 0 57 0 04 nse test 0 30 0 42 ridge nse train 0 53 0 06 nse test 0 35 0 28 lasso nse train 0 57 0 04 nse test 0 33 0 37 considering the model comparison above ridge with a penalty had greater robustness than either original or lasso and revealed more universal laws thus we trained the ridge model with all the samples and obtained the following equations for further attribution analysis 11 r 0 56 p 0 01 t 0 16 a channel 0 16 a slope 0 54 12 s 0 53 p 0 05 t 0 20 a channel 0 13 a slope 0 61 where r is runoff s is sediment load p is precipitation t is temperature a channel is the cumulative control area of check dams and a slope is the comprehensive slope area all values were normalized with the above two equations we could capture changes of the contribution of different factors over time continuously 3 3 impact of influencing factors on runoff and sediment load considering the complexity of the natural environment the substantial fluctuation of annual sequences owing to climatic variations and the impact of soil and water conservation measures it is more revealing to evaluate the long term i e decadal contribution rate rather than the short term i e interannual or intermonthly rate for attribution analysis regarding runoff and sediment load thus we calculated the contribution rates of precipitation temperature channel measures and slope measures i e terracing grass planting afforestation and closures to runoff and sediment load changes by decade fig 6 shows that the contribution rates of the climate factors indicate a decreasing trend during the 1950 2010 s the contribution rate of precipitation to runoff sediment changes from the 1950 s to the 1960 s was as high as 89 2 90 8 but dropped to 7 1 6 4 from the 1990 s to the 2000 s conversely the contribution rates of anthropogenic activities increased from the 1950 s to the 1960 s slope measures contributed 10 8 9 2 to runoff sediment reduction channel measures played a more important role in sediment reduction than in runoff reduction from the 2000 s to the 2010 s the contribution rate of channel measures to runoff sediment reduction increased up to 49 3 58 1 and that of slope measures increased up to 37 0 28 1 specifically the same slope measure usually had greater influence on runoff reduction than on sediment reduction among the slope measures afforestation played the leading role followed by grass planting measures in particular following implementation of the grain for green project in 1999 chen et al 2015 the area of forest land increased more rapidly than before and the contribution rate increased from 78 6 77 4 to 90 5 90 2 for runoff sediment reduction after 2000 few new terraces were added leading to low contribution rates i e just 0 5 for runoff and 0 4 for sediment 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainty of period division fig 5 shows that the prediction performance fluctuated on the training and testing sets obtained from random division owing to the complexity of the data sequences and the considerable number of outliers indicating that period division could cause substantial uncertainty in attribution analysis for instance we tested different period division methods i e the mann kendall test pettitt test and aam on the datasets of runoff sediment and precipitation of the hfc 1954 2015 fig 7 and found that the identified change year would vary by up to 10 years the pettitt method identified the change year as 1989 for both the runoff sequence and the sediment load sequence significance level p 0 05 whereas no change point was identified from the rainfall sequence the mann kendall test identified the change year as 1997 for the runoff sequence and 1999 for the sediment load sequence significance level p 0 05 whereas no change year was identified from the rainfall sequence the aam recognized the change year as 1982 for the runoff sequence 1989 for the sediment load sequence and 1979 for the rainfall sequence minor changes in the data such as sequence length also caused substantial difference in the change years determined by period division for instance the change year for the runoff and sediment load sequences identified using the pettitt method changed from 1989 to 1984 when the data sequences were cut from 1954 2015 to 1954 2010 substantial differences could also occur in different studies even though the same method may be used for the same watershed as shown in table 3 4 2 comparison with previous attribution studies 4 2 1 comparison with previous statistical regression studies the attribution framework proposed in this study achieved certain improvements in comparison with previous attribution analyses using traditional statistical regression methods traditional statistical regression obtains only simple and lumped effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities for instance gao et al 2017 detected the change year as 1990 for runoff and 1981 for sediment load in a study of the middle reaches of the yellow river for the period 1957 2008 using the double mass curve method they suggested that the average contribution rate of anthropogenic interventions to runoff reduction was 78 5 between 1991 and 2008 while the contribution rate of anthropogenic interventions to sediment reduction was 90 4 between 1982 and 2008 zhao et al 2014 also quantified the impact of climate variability and anthropogenic activities on runoff in the middle reaches of the yellow river based on comparison of the periods before and after the change point they concluded that anthropogenic activities accounted for greater reduction in mean annual streamflow than that associated with the effects of climate change in general in our study we quantified the annual variation of anthropogenic activities without period division and the calculated contribution rate was not limited to a certain period which allowed the attribution analysis to be more flexible and detailed specifically we selected the features for model input by considering the hydrological processes collinearity and correlation between features we structured an index for slope measures based on detailed field research and experimental study on the impact of the different features which avoided interference from collinearity between different slope measures most previous related research that applied multiple linear regression paid little attention to this process li et al 2014 used only land use data to perform the regression in their study on the luanhe river basin and they found that the regression accuracy was low and that the causality of water area and runoff was unclear unlike earlier regression studies that could not capture the unclear data distribution and considerable outliers we added penalty items that reduced the interference of outliers and improved the universality of the final results after comparison nevertheless in our framework the fitted relationship could forecast intervals with high probability of future dynamics rapidly after setting the future meteorological and anthropogenic factors which has valuable implications regarding river management however most similar regression based research applied the original least squares method which considers all the data records equally in the fitting process while not evaluating the reliability of the regression equations kong et al 2016 4 2 2 comparison with previous physically based modeling studies physical models have superiority in theoretical foundation and high simulation accuracy which cannot be realized using statistical methods yang et al 2000 physically based modeling studies on the hfc began in 1978 and 1979 using swat li et al 2017 zuo et al 2016 1976 using dyrim shi et al 2016 and 1976 using gbhm lu et al 2020 however comprehensive consideration of anthropogenic effects in physical models is a challenge owing to their inherent complexity and thus they are usually not applicable to loess plateau watersheds undergoing intensive anthropogenic interference lu et al 2020 zhao et al 2013 to overcome the problem of model complexity physical models usually apply the same attribution framework as traditional regression methods after dividing the baseline period and the changing period the contribution rate of anthropogenic factors is quantified as the difference between the total runoff sediment load change and that induced by climate change the former being calculated from observations and the latter simulated using models calibrated during natural periods zhao et al 2018 such physical models cannot distinguish various soil and water conservation measures for example xu et al 2013 and wu et al 2018 both employed swat to attribute the runoff change in the yanhe river basin china the model calibrated during the natural period was considered to represent the underlying conditions of the basin without anthropogenic interventions and the differences between the simulated and observed runoff series were calculated and used to quantify the accumulative hydrological effects of all anthropogenic activities chang et al 2015 using the same attribution rationale applied the vic model to attribute the runoff decrease in the weihe river basin china which also left the separate hydrological effects of anthropogenic factors unresolved some of the physical models applied to studies of the loess plateau added anthropogenic activity modules that merely considered check dams and revegetation ignoring terraces and the other soil and water conservation measures moreover in those physical models vegetation change was usually represented by land use change alone which cannot characterize the variation with limited resolution time series data lu et al 2020 for instance yin et al 2017 ran swat to quantify the contribution of climate and land use change to runoff decrease in the jinghe river basin through comparison of different scenarios shi et al 2019 also used swat to investigate the hydrological effects of land use change and check dams in the wuding river basin china liu et al 2019 quantified the separate hydrological impacts of climate change land use distribution change and human water use in the weihe river basin using the wep l model in comparison with land use change the annual levels of different soil and water conservation measures considered in this study are more direct and detailed for attribution analysis of runoff and sediment load reduction on the loess plateau high uncertainty in period division is likely to cause errors in estimation of contribution rates undermining the value of substantial computational cost gao et al 2016 because of the considerable differences between the mechanisms of runoff and sediment production most hydrological models can only simulate runoff such as vic chang et al 2015 wep liu et al 2019 and gbhm yang et al 2002 while most erosion models e g sedd can only simulate sediment load ferro and porto 2000 the inconsistency between runoff and sediment load simulations may result in bias in the evaluation of specific factors models that can simulate both runoff and sediment e g swat usually involve a large proportion of empirical formulas in the process and set parameters using regression for example the swat process incorporates the manning coefficient usle equation factors usle is empirical an exponent parameter for calculating the sediment retrained in channel sediment routing and a linear parameter for calculating the maximum amount of sediment that can be retrained during channel sediment routing li et al 2017 shi et al 2019 4 3 applicability and limitation exiting studies already confirm the usability and applicability of the traditional empirical models that conduct period division and simply set the linear relationship between runoff sediment load and precipitation in attribution analysis of the loess plateau gao et al 2017 kong et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 the multiple regression model developed in this study can be regarded as the improved version of the traditional ones because of the careful feature selection procedure this framework can quantify the influence of different factors directly furthermore the features selection is flexible they can be combined freely based on available data and physical understanding for example land use data can be involved easily in this framework this characteristic increases the analysis framework s extensibility it s also possible that utilize this model to forecast runoff and sediment load in the future this model enables researchers to gain moderate intervals with high probability rapidly after setting future meteorological and anthropogenic factors which will be an important reference for river management the characteristics of the hfc in this study were extremely simplified each characteristic of the whole basin in a year was represented by only a number the temporal information was generalized and the spatial characteristics were completely missing under the annual scale and lumped form the model could only capture the most simplified and basic laws although this processing greatly simplifies the amount of calculation it is destined that the model is weak in simulating and predicting extreme values the values given by the model tended to be moderate and concentrated in a minor range it resulted in the lower accuracy of simulation and prediction compared to the advanced distributed models especially for sediment load which contained more outliers in its series however the accuracy result can not deny that the model s advantages for estimating contribution rates in a basin with great changes as discussed in section 4 2 machine learning methods have been applied to simulation and prediction in numerous fields in such a drastically changing watershed like the hfc the capabilities of machine learning have not yet been fully utilized large amounts of data are the major prerequisite for all the high accuracy simulations and machine learning is not the exception high precision is at the cost of increasing the complexity of the model under the premise of complete professional knowledge and sufficient data the increasingly advanced machine learning deep learning technology will become a powerful method for future runoff and sediment load prediction 5 conclusions to overcome the limitations of current attribution analysis regarding runoff and sediment load changes on the loess plateau namely period division and distinction of anthropogenic activities we developed a statistical attribution framework that does not require division of a time series into baseline and changing periods combining the strong data mining capabilities of regression with existing understanding regarding soil and water conservation practices we obtained details of continuous change in the contribution rates of precipitation temperature check dams terraces grass planting afforestation and closures to both runoff and sediment load changes moreover we improved the traditional regression method choosing ridge regression that adds a penalty term to reduce the influence of outliers and to promote the universality of the results we found that the contribution rate of each factor to the variation of runoff and sediment load has changed continuously over past decades since the 1950s the contribution rate of climate change anthropogenic activities has decreased increased from 1954 1959 to 2000 2015 the contribution rate of climate change with precipitation reduction as the main factor influencing runoff sediment reduction was 35 34 and the contribution rate of anthropogenic activities was 65 66 among the various anthropogenic interventions the contribution rate of channel measures to runoff reduction is close to that of slope measures while the sediment reduction effect of channel measures 39 is greater than that of slope measures 27 the impact of slope measures has been greater on runoff reduction than on sediment reduction whereas the impact of channel measures has been greater on sediment reduction than on runoff reduction among the four slope measures the contribution rate of afforestation has been greatest because both channel measures and slope measures have contributed to considerable runoff and sediment decrease we recommend that further expansion of soil and water conservation measures be studied carefully with regard to

8079,study region the huangfuchuan basin on the loess plateau china study focus runoff and the sediment load of the yellow river in china have received substantial attention owing to their marked declines over recent decades climate change and intensive anthropogenic activities soil and water conservation measures on the loess plateau are regarded as the main factors responsible for the dramatic declines thus attribution analysis on the roles of such influencing factors is important for the sustainable management in this study annual scale variations of runoff and sediment load of a typical watershed undergoing intensive change were simulated using three regression algorithms the impacts of climate change namely precipitation and temperature and anthropogenic activities namely channel measures check dam construction and slope measures terracing afforestation grass planting and closures on runoff and sediment load variations were quantified continuously for the period 1954 2015 new hydrological insights for the region results indicated that the main climate change factor was precipitation reduction which was attributed to 35 and 34 of runoff reduction and sediment load reduction respectively channel measures caused 32 and 39 of runoff reduction and sediment load reduction respectively whereas slope measures caused 33 and 27 of runoff reduction and sediment load reduction respectively we recommend that further implications of soil and water conservation measures be studied carefully on the loess plateau keywords water reduction sediment reduction machine learning conservation measures loess plateau attribution analysis 1 introduction the loess plateau of china universally known for its severe soil erosion extends over a large area 640 000 km2 of the upper and middle reaches of the yellow river basin fu et al 2017 he et al 2006 shi and shao 2000 the considerable loss of soil on the loess plateau has led to high sediment load of the yellow river 1 6 gt year 1 before the 1950s risk of land degradation threat to sustainability of the entire ecosystem and widespread socioeconomic concern li et al 2017 2016 wang et al 2016 to mitigate the severe soil erosion on the loess plateau many soil and water conservation practices were adopted in previous decades which can be classified broadly as either channel measures or slope measures liu 2016 channel measures include construction of dams and reservoirs in gullies and river channels whereas slope measures include terracing grass planting afforestation and closure measures to promote revegetation on slopes fu et al 2017 liu 2016 following implementation of soil and water conservation practices on the loess plateau the sediment load and runoff of the yellow river decreased by 0 02 gt year 1 and 0 25 km3 year 1 respectively from the 1950s to the 2010s wang et al 2016 however the substantial reduction in runoff has aggravated water shortages in the yellow river and severely restricted local socioeconomic development yang et al 2004 to guarantee water security for the regional ecosystem and local socioeconomic development it is crucial to quantify precisely the impacts of both climate change and soil and water conservation measures on runoff and sediment load variations on the loess plateau boix fayos et al 2007 kondolf et al 2014 zhao et al 2018 diverse methods such as statistical regression methods elastic methods and physical numerical models have been applied to address this issue kong et al 2016 statistical methods such as simple linear regression and the double mass curve method which are among the techniques used most commonly usually divide a time series into baseline and changing periods and establish the relationship between precipitation and discharge sediment load using long term historical data to detect the effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities gao et al 2017 2016 zhao et al 2018 elastic methods applied to the loess plateau are usually based on the budyko framework which considers both water and energy constraints in hydrological processes over the long term budyko and mif al tirgume ha mada 1963 marlatt et al 1975 wu et al 2017a most statistical regression methods and elastic methods which are lumped and easily applicable ignore spatial heterogeneity and assume uniformity of hydrological variables and parameters in an entire basin gao et al 2017 tian et al 2016 zhao et al 2014 physical hydrological models developed recently are usually distributed and have finer temporal and spatial resolutions ferro and porto 2000 jiao et al 2017 yang et al 2000 such models apply varying parameters for the different meshes and simulate and predict site specific variations over different time scales de vente et al 2013 liu et al 2006 2019 lu et al 2020 various physical models have been built or applied to discover the principles of hydrological variation such as swat li et al 2017 gbhm cong et al 2009 lu et al 2020 yang et al 2000 vic chang et al 2015 and dyrim shi et al 2016 however it is not easy to overcome their limitations including complex model structures large numbers of input datasets time costs and uncertainty in model calibration and validation gao et al 2016 moreover nonphysical processes such as parameter calibration are still required for most physical models wu et al 2018 xu et al 2013 in addition to the inherent shortcomings outlined above such models have two universal limitations in attribution research period division and multiple factor decomposition in assessment of the hydrological response to climate change and anthropogenic activities most studies divide the hydrological time series into two or more periods based on change point detection ma et al 2014 shi and wang 2015 the first period is taken as the baseline or reference period during which very limited or no substantial anthropogenic activities occur the second period is considered as the changing period during which the watershed experiences marked changes in land use dam construction and afforestation deforestation gao et al 2017 tian et al 2016 zhao et al 2014 the change point detection method is an efficient and scientific approach to identify the division between the baseline and changing periods previous related studies have applied various change detection methods to analyze the statistical features of long term hydrological time series tang et al 2013 zhao et al 2015b methods commonly used to detect change points include the sequential mann kendall test double mass curve pettitt test and accumulative anomaly method aam kendall 1948 mann 1945 wang et al 2012 wu et al 2017a however period division can introduce considerable uncertainty wu et al 2017b for the same watershed or even the same hydrological sequence results based on change points obtained in different studies can be markedly different taking the runoff sequence of the huangfuchuan basin hfc in the middle reaches of the yellow river as an example the abrupt change point has been identified as 1979 zhou et al 2015 1984 shi and wang 2015 and 1996 tian et al 2016 nevertheless attribution analysis based on period division assumes that the entire basin is unaffected by anthropogenic activities during the baseline period whereas it is considered affected by anthropogenic activities to the same degree every year throughout the changing period which limits the nuance of quantitative results zhao et al 2018 2014 most traditional statistical regression methods and elastic coefficient methods cannot separate the effects of specific soil and water conservation measures zhao et al 2018 the physical models that do not include an anthropogenic activity module conduct the same attribution analysis procedure as mentioned above chang et al 2015 wu et al 2018 the few models that do include such a module merely consider the impact of certain soil and water conservation measures liu et al 2019 lu et al 2020 shi et al 2019 which are generally not comprehensive and increase the inherent structural complexity and computational cost lu et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 only a few models integrate the impact of terrace construction which is an important component of soil and water conservation practices in china fu et al 2017 liu 2016 machine learning models work well in finding complicated relationships between different influencing factors mitchell 1997 among the various machine learning algorithms linear regression is the simplest but the most interpretable freedman 2009 in a study of the luanhe river basin in north china li et al 2014 applied multilinear regression to detect the relations between annual runoff and influencing factors that included precipitation urban area water area unused area and agricultural area and they successfully identified the main factor attributed to annual runoff reduction to address the aforementioned issues in this study we proposed a regression model family using carefully selected features and fitting algorithms for analysis of runoff and sediment load variations and skipped the period division procedure in quantifying the impact of precipitation temperature and major types of soil and water conservation practice namely channel measures and slope measures data quality and fitting methods determine the result of attribution analysis based on the regression model the loess plateau has experienced dramatic changes over past decades chen et al 2015 wang et al 2016 and the proportion of outliers in the time series is considerable furthermore input features should be considered carefully based on collinearity and correlation 2 material and methods 2 1 study sites the huangfuchuan river which is a first order tributary of the yellow river s middle reaches originates on the ordos plateau and discharges into the yellow river in fugu county shaanxi province fig 1 it has total length of 137 km and its watershed covers an area of 3246 km2 the watershed is located in a transition zone between desert grassland and the loess plateau and it has a typical semiarid continental climate the mean annual temperature in the basin is 6 2 7 2 increasing from northwest to southeast average annual precipitation is approximately 380 420 mm concentrated mainly during june september zhao et al 2018 according to records from huangfu station which is the control hydrological station at the basin outlet annual mean runoff and annual mean sediment yield between 1954 and 2015 were approximately 125 million m3 and 39 million tons respectively severe soil erosion contributed to the high sediment concentration in the yellow river over a long period wei et al 2017 zhao et al 2015a however since the 1970 s a series of soil and water conservation measures have been implemented for example check dam construction in channels and slope measures such as afforestation grass planting and terracing fu et al 2017 as a consequence of the conservation measures and climate change both runoff and sediment load have decreased substantially in recent decades chen et al 2015 wang et al 2016 2 2 datasets daily runoff and sediment load data from 1954 to 2015 were obtained from the huangfu station and converted to the annual scale by summation or averaging precipitation observation data were obtained from the hydrology bureau of the yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources precipitation data from 1954 to 2015 were collected from the 15 rainfall stations distributed uniformly within the area fig 1 and annual mean precipitation was calculated by applying the inverse distance weighting method shepard 1968 daily meteorological data were collected from hequ station which is the closest national meteorological station to the huangfu hydrological station and shares similar elevation the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi reflects vegetation status we obtained ndvi data from the avhrr ndvi 3 g v1 0 product provided as part of nasa s global inventory monitoring and modeling system the dataset starts in 1982 has a half monthly time step and 1 12 spatial resolution which is equivalent to 8 km information regarding check dams which was obtained from a general survey of water resources and the administration of the yellow river s middle reaches included details of the construction time total storage capacity and control area of each dam data regarding soil and water conservation measures were collected from the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc the annual scale data series was produced from multisource data including field investigation data of small watersheds statistics of soil and water conservation measures interpretation of remote sensing imagery verification and analysis of typical sample areas mathematical statistics and expert consultation data information relating to the datasets collected for use in this study is listed in table 1 2 3 methodologies we built an integrated framework for attribution analysis on runoff and sediment variation fig 2 presents a flowchart of the simulation and analysis methods embedded within the developed framework 2 3 1 data processing data processing is performed to extract and reconstruct features from the original data analyze the correlations of features between themselves and with runoff and sediment load and explore the set of features that provides the optimum balance 1 feature extraction scale transition is undertaken to transform data with various time scales to the annual scale as shown in table 1 linear combination is adopted to reconstruct new features on the basis of the collected data and understanding of hydrological processes we produced a composite slope feature index a slope to represent the degree of slope measures implemented to reduce runoff and sediment load 1 a slope Œ± g a grass Œ± f a forest Œ± t a terrace Œ± c a closure where a i is the conservation area of the i th type of slope measure and Œ± i is the corresponding runoff reduction modulus sediment reduction modulus for runoff the ratio was estimated as Œ± g Œ± f Œ± t Œ± c 0 7 0 8 1 0 0 2 while for sediment it was set to Œ± g Œ± f Œ± t Œ± c 0 9 0 9 1 0 0 2 wang and fan 2002 input normalization is performed to conduct a min max normalization procedure before performing the regression it is necessary because the existence of different units and ranges among the input data can influence the results as shown in eq 2 2 x y max y min x x min x max x min y min where x is the original input data and x min and x max are the minimum and maximum values of x respectively y min and y max are the lower and upper bounds of the normalized data in this study the normalized output result x was constrained to the range of 1 1 therefore y min and y max are set as 1 and 1 respectively 2 feature selection correlation analysis is performed to select those features that have strong correlation with runoff and sediment load adding the types of input data increasing the number of dimensions certainly enhances the simulation performance for the training set but it tends to decrease the applicability and interpretability of the trained model moreover the problem of overfitting can never be ignored collinearity analysis is undertaken to determine the feature set that has weaker collinearity for linear regression models the existence of collinearity between explanatory variables distorts model estimations and greatly reduces model interpretability therefore it is crucial to calculate the correlation between features and to construct input features reasonably and carefully before model development the pearson correlation coefficient which is adopted as the vital basis for data selection can be calculated as follows 3 r x y cov x y var x var y the pairs that contain null value are skipped since data periods are different 2 3 2 linear regression 1 model selection it is very difficult to develop a satisfactory model for the hfc owing to the limitation on data size and quality in addition to the marked and persistent changes within the basin we tested three linear regression algorithms ordinary least squares ordinary ridge regression ridge and lasso regression lasso and selected the optimal method for further attribution analysis freedman 2009 in a linear regression model the i th sample x i y i in the training set includes the input vector x i x 1 i x 2 i x p i where x i r p and the corresponding target value y i r the target value y i is expected to be a linear combination of the elements in x i such that the predicted value y ÀÜ i can be calculated using the following equation 4 y ÀÜ i w b x i w 1 x 1 i w p x p i b where w w 1 w 2 w p is a parameter vector and b is a scalar both of which can be learned from the training set 2 3 2 1 ordinary linear regression ordinary ordinary linear regression aims to minimize the residual sum of squares between n observed targets y i and the predicted targets y ÀÜ i via linear approximation where n is the size of the input training data the loss function to minimize can be expressed as follows 5 min w b 1 n i 1 n y ÀÜ i y i 2 2 3 2 2 ridge regression ridge different from ordinary regression ridge regression can solve partial problems of ordinary least squares by imposing a penalty on the size of the coefficients the ridge coefficients minimize a penalized residual sum of squares 6 min w b 1 n i 1 n y ÀÜ i y i 2 Œ± w 2 2 where Œ± is a constant and w 2 2 is the l 2 norm of the parameter vector w the complexity parameter Œ± 0 controls the amount of shrinkage that is as the value of Œ± increases the amount of shrinkage increases and thus the coefficients become more robust to collinearity 2 3 2 3 lasso regression lasso the lasso is a linear model that estimates sparse coefficients it is useful in certain contexts owing to its tendency to prefer solutions with fewer non zero coefficients effectively reducing the number of features upon which the given solution is dependent for this reason lasso and its variants are fundamental to the field of compressed sensing under certain conditions it can recover the exact set of non zero coefficients mathematically it consists of a linear model with an added regularization term the objective function to minimize can be expressed as follows 7 min w b 1 n i 1 n y ÀÜ i y i 2 Œ± w 1 the lasso estimate thus solves the minimization of the least squares penalty with Œ± w 1 added where Œ± is a constant and w 1 is the l 1 norm of the parameter vector w 2 model evaluation we aimed to skip the period division process through addition of the indices of anthropogenic activities and thus build a regression model suitable for the entire period because of the limited sample size the training and testing sets in the different divisions did not have stable distributions which led to fluctuation in model performance therefore repetition was necessary for model evaluation we performed random sample division 100 times and trained and tested each model to reduce the impact of randomness thoroughly ascertain the potential performance of each model and assess the capability of each model more comprehensively the training set and the verification set comprised 80 and 20 of the samples respectively the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient which is used commonly in evaluation of the results of hydrological models was adopted as the index with which to assess the machine learning model s simulation for both the training and the testing sets the nse value for the training set reflects the empirical risk of the model while the nse score for the testing set reflects the prediction capability of the model the generalization capability of the model is decided based on the model s combined scores for the two sets the nse coefficient can be calculated as follows 8 nse 1 i 1 n o i m i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where m i is the model simulations o i is the observations o is the average of the observations and n is the total number of observations 2 3 3 attribution analysis machine learning has a powerful capability for data mining and relationship exploration with careful feature selection based on physical understanding it is possible to use a trained model to explore the influence of multiple features on complicated hydrological changes the attribution rate of the selected features causing runoff and sediment load changes in the hfc is expressed as follows 9 ar i w i x i j 1 p w j x j where ar i is the attribution rate of i th factor p is the number of features and x i is the difference of the i th factor between two periods for the combined factor a slope we conducted decomposition to obtain the attribution rates of the different slope measures the decomposition function is expressed as follows 10 ar i Œ± i a i Œ± g a grass Œ± f a forest Œ± t a terrace Œ± c a closure ar slope i grass forest terrace closure where the meaning of symbols is the same as in eqs 1 and 9 the features finally determined for attribution analysis are listed in table 2 3 results 3 1 feature selection in this study input features for machine learning were selected according to physical understanding and correlation analysis of runoff and sediment load and their potential influencing factors in the hfc the annual scale correlation coefficients among all the normalized time series data are shown in fig 3 the three meteorological features of precipitation temperature and relative humidity were the main factors influencing runoff and sediment load precipitation had the strongest positive correlation with both runoff and sediment load with coefficients of 0 66 and 0 58 respectively temperature also played an important role in the variations of runoff and sediment load that is the correlation coefficient with runoff and sediment load was 0 22 and 0 25 respectively changes caused by anthropogenic activities are indicated by the cumulative control area and storage capacity of check dams ndvi areas of forests grass terraces closures and integrated slope measures the correlation coefficients of the cumulative control area of check dams with runoff and sediment load were 0 54 and 0 52 respectively and those of the cumulative storage capacity were 0 51 and 0 49 respectively the two features of check dams had strong self correlation and the correlation of control area with hydrological changes was larger than storage thus the cumulative control area of check dams was taken as the representative feature of channel measures and applied in further analysis additionally the correlation coefficients of ndvi with runoff and sediment load were 0 38 and 0 39 respectively the features of the slope measures had strong inner correlation most values were 0 9 and relatively obvious negative correlation with both runoff and sediment although terracing grass planting afforestation and closures are independent features their variation has significant correlation thus we selected the calculated comprehensive slope area to represent the feature of slope measures therefore the input features selected for building the machine learning models were precipitation temperature cumulative control area of check dams and comprehensive slope area table 2 the temporal variation patterns of the selected variables are illustrated in fig 4 the period of achannel was shorter than 1960 2015 the values between 1960 and 1970 were assumed as zeros since the first check dam documented in the hfc built in 1972 while the values between 2012 and 2015 are the linear extents on the values between 2010 and 2012 3 2 regression results three linear regression algorithms were applied to construct the models for simulation of the annual runoff and sediment load of the hfc we trained and tested the models using 100 groups of datasets obtained by random division the nse value was calculated for assessment of the simulation and prediction capabilities of the models fig 5 for all models the simulation capability on the training set was reasonably robust whereas the prediction accuracy on the test set fluctuated remarkably in particular runoff training was more robust than sediment load training moreover the fitting performance of both training and testing of runoff was better than that of sediment load in comparison with the original and lasso algorithms ridge got slight smaller accuracy in training than the other two methods but obtained better testing results for both runoff and sediment load fig 5 the runoff model performances were original nse train 0 70 0 04 nse test 0 51 0 29 ridge nse train 0 65 0 06 nse test 0 55 0 20 lasso nse train 0 70 0 04 nse test 0 53 0 25 the sediment model performances were original nse train 0 57 0 04 nse test 0 30 0 42 ridge nse train 0 53 0 06 nse test 0 35 0 28 lasso nse train 0 57 0 04 nse test 0 33 0 37 considering the model comparison above ridge with a penalty had greater robustness than either original or lasso and revealed more universal laws thus we trained the ridge model with all the samples and obtained the following equations for further attribution analysis 11 r 0 56 p 0 01 t 0 16 a channel 0 16 a slope 0 54 12 s 0 53 p 0 05 t 0 20 a channel 0 13 a slope 0 61 where r is runoff s is sediment load p is precipitation t is temperature a channel is the cumulative control area of check dams and a slope is the comprehensive slope area all values were normalized with the above two equations we could capture changes of the contribution of different factors over time continuously 3 3 impact of influencing factors on runoff and sediment load considering the complexity of the natural environment the substantial fluctuation of annual sequences owing to climatic variations and the impact of soil and water conservation measures it is more revealing to evaluate the long term i e decadal contribution rate rather than the short term i e interannual or intermonthly rate for attribution analysis regarding runoff and sediment load thus we calculated the contribution rates of precipitation temperature channel measures and slope measures i e terracing grass planting afforestation and closures to runoff and sediment load changes by decade fig 6 shows that the contribution rates of the climate factors indicate a decreasing trend during the 1950 2010 s the contribution rate of precipitation to runoff sediment changes from the 1950 s to the 1960 s was as high as 89 2 90 8 but dropped to 7 1 6 4 from the 1990 s to the 2000 s conversely the contribution rates of anthropogenic activities increased from the 1950 s to the 1960 s slope measures contributed 10 8 9 2 to runoff sediment reduction channel measures played a more important role in sediment reduction than in runoff reduction from the 2000 s to the 2010 s the contribution rate of channel measures to runoff sediment reduction increased up to 49 3 58 1 and that of slope measures increased up to 37 0 28 1 specifically the same slope measure usually had greater influence on runoff reduction than on sediment reduction among the slope measures afforestation played the leading role followed by grass planting measures in particular following implementation of the grain for green project in 1999 chen et al 2015 the area of forest land increased more rapidly than before and the contribution rate increased from 78 6 77 4 to 90 5 90 2 for runoff sediment reduction after 2000 few new terraces were added leading to low contribution rates i e just 0 5 for runoff and 0 4 for sediment 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainty of period division fig 5 shows that the prediction performance fluctuated on the training and testing sets obtained from random division owing to the complexity of the data sequences and the considerable number of outliers indicating that period division could cause substantial uncertainty in attribution analysis for instance we tested different period division methods i e the mann kendall test pettitt test and aam on the datasets of runoff sediment and precipitation of the hfc 1954 2015 fig 7 and found that the identified change year would vary by up to 10 years the pettitt method identified the change year as 1989 for both the runoff sequence and the sediment load sequence significance level p 0 05 whereas no change point was identified from the rainfall sequence the mann kendall test identified the change year as 1997 for the runoff sequence and 1999 for the sediment load sequence significance level p 0 05 whereas no change year was identified from the rainfall sequence the aam recognized the change year as 1982 for the runoff sequence 1989 for the sediment load sequence and 1979 for the rainfall sequence minor changes in the data such as sequence length also caused substantial difference in the change years determined by period division for instance the change year for the runoff and sediment load sequences identified using the pettitt method changed from 1989 to 1984 when the data sequences were cut from 1954 2015 to 1954 2010 substantial differences could also occur in different studies even though the same method may be used for the same watershed as shown in table 3 4 2 comparison with previous attribution studies 4 2 1 comparison with previous statistical regression studies the attribution framework proposed in this study achieved certain improvements in comparison with previous attribution analyses using traditional statistical regression methods traditional statistical regression obtains only simple and lumped effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities for instance gao et al 2017 detected the change year as 1990 for runoff and 1981 for sediment load in a study of the middle reaches of the yellow river for the period 1957 2008 using the double mass curve method they suggested that the average contribution rate of anthropogenic interventions to runoff reduction was 78 5 between 1991 and 2008 while the contribution rate of anthropogenic interventions to sediment reduction was 90 4 between 1982 and 2008 zhao et al 2014 also quantified the impact of climate variability and anthropogenic activities on runoff in the middle reaches of the yellow river based on comparison of the periods before and after the change point they concluded that anthropogenic activities accounted for greater reduction in mean annual streamflow than that associated with the effects of climate change in general in our study we quantified the annual variation of anthropogenic activities without period division and the calculated contribution rate was not limited to a certain period which allowed the attribution analysis to be more flexible and detailed specifically we selected the features for model input by considering the hydrological processes collinearity and correlation between features we structured an index for slope measures based on detailed field research and experimental study on the impact of the different features which avoided interference from collinearity between different slope measures most previous related research that applied multiple linear regression paid little attention to this process li et al 2014 used only land use data to perform the regression in their study on the luanhe river basin and they found that the regression accuracy was low and that the causality of water area and runoff was unclear unlike earlier regression studies that could not capture the unclear data distribution and considerable outliers we added penalty items that reduced the interference of outliers and improved the universality of the final results after comparison nevertheless in our framework the fitted relationship could forecast intervals with high probability of future dynamics rapidly after setting the future meteorological and anthropogenic factors which has valuable implications regarding river management however most similar regression based research applied the original least squares method which considers all the data records equally in the fitting process while not evaluating the reliability of the regression equations kong et al 2016 4 2 2 comparison with previous physically based modeling studies physical models have superiority in theoretical foundation and high simulation accuracy which cannot be realized using statistical methods yang et al 2000 physically based modeling studies on the hfc began in 1978 and 1979 using swat li et al 2017 zuo et al 2016 1976 using dyrim shi et al 2016 and 1976 using gbhm lu et al 2020 however comprehensive consideration of anthropogenic effects in physical models is a challenge owing to their inherent complexity and thus they are usually not applicable to loess plateau watersheds undergoing intensive anthropogenic interference lu et al 2020 zhao et al 2013 to overcome the problem of model complexity physical models usually apply the same attribution framework as traditional regression methods after dividing the baseline period and the changing period the contribution rate of anthropogenic factors is quantified as the difference between the total runoff sediment load change and that induced by climate change the former being calculated from observations and the latter simulated using models calibrated during natural periods zhao et al 2018 such physical models cannot distinguish various soil and water conservation measures for example xu et al 2013 and wu et al 2018 both employed swat to attribute the runoff change in the yanhe river basin china the model calibrated during the natural period was considered to represent the underlying conditions of the basin without anthropogenic interventions and the differences between the simulated and observed runoff series were calculated and used to quantify the accumulative hydrological effects of all anthropogenic activities chang et al 2015 using the same attribution rationale applied the vic model to attribute the runoff decrease in the weihe river basin china which also left the separate hydrological effects of anthropogenic factors unresolved some of the physical models applied to studies of the loess plateau added anthropogenic activity modules that merely considered check dams and revegetation ignoring terraces and the other soil and water conservation measures moreover in those physical models vegetation change was usually represented by land use change alone which cannot characterize the variation with limited resolution time series data lu et al 2020 for instance yin et al 2017 ran swat to quantify the contribution of climate and land use change to runoff decrease in the jinghe river basin through comparison of different scenarios shi et al 2019 also used swat to investigate the hydrological effects of land use change and check dams in the wuding river basin china liu et al 2019 quantified the separate hydrological impacts of climate change land use distribution change and human water use in the weihe river basin using the wep l model in comparison with land use change the annual levels of different soil and water conservation measures considered in this study are more direct and detailed for attribution analysis of runoff and sediment load reduction on the loess plateau high uncertainty in period division is likely to cause errors in estimation of contribution rates undermining the value of substantial computational cost gao et al 2016 because of the considerable differences between the mechanisms of runoff and sediment production most hydrological models can only simulate runoff such as vic chang et al 2015 wep liu et al 2019 and gbhm yang et al 2002 while most erosion models e g sedd can only simulate sediment load ferro and porto 2000 the inconsistency between runoff and sediment load simulations may result in bias in the evaluation of specific factors models that can simulate both runoff and sediment e g swat usually involve a large proportion of empirical formulas in the process and set parameters using regression for example the swat process incorporates the manning coefficient usle equation factors usle is empirical an exponent parameter for calculating the sediment retrained in channel sediment routing and a linear parameter for calculating the maximum amount of sediment that can be retrained during channel sediment routing li et al 2017 shi et al 2019 4 3 applicability and limitation exiting studies already confirm the usability and applicability of the traditional empirical models that conduct period division and simply set the linear relationship between runoff sediment load and precipitation in attribution analysis of the loess plateau gao et al 2017 kong et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 the multiple regression model developed in this study can be regarded as the improved version of the traditional ones because of the careful feature selection procedure this framework can quantify the influence of different factors directly furthermore the features selection is flexible they can be combined freely based on available data and physical understanding for example land use data can be involved easily in this framework this characteristic increases the analysis framework s extensibility it s also possible that utilize this model to forecast runoff and sediment load in the future this model enables researchers to gain moderate intervals with high probability rapidly after setting future meteorological and anthropogenic factors which will be an important reference for river management the characteristics of the hfc in this study were extremely simplified each characteristic of the whole basin in a year was represented by only a number the temporal information was generalized and the spatial characteristics were completely missing under the annual scale and lumped form the model could only capture the most simplified and basic laws although this processing greatly simplifies the amount of calculation it is destined that the model is weak in simulating and predicting extreme values the values given by the model tended to be moderate and concentrated in a minor range it resulted in the lower accuracy of simulation and prediction compared to the advanced distributed models especially for sediment load which contained more outliers in its series however the accuracy result can not deny that the model s advantages for estimating contribution rates in a basin with great changes as discussed in section 4 2 machine learning methods have been applied to simulation and prediction in numerous fields in such a drastically changing watershed like the hfc the capabilities of machine learning have not yet been fully utilized large amounts of data are the major prerequisite for all the high accuracy simulations and machine learning is not the exception high precision is at the cost of increasing the complexity of the model under the premise of complete professional knowledge and sufficient data the increasingly advanced machine learning deep learning technology will become a powerful method for future runoff and sediment load prediction 5 conclusions to overcome the limitations of current attribution analysis regarding runoff and sediment load changes on the loess plateau namely period division and distinction of anthropogenic activities we developed a statistical attribution framework that does not require division of a time series into baseline and changing periods combining the strong data mining capabilities of regression with existing understanding regarding soil and water conservation practices we obtained details of continuous change in the contribution rates of precipitation temperature check dams terraces grass planting afforestation and closures to both runoff and sediment load changes moreover we improved the traditional regression method choosing ridge regression that adds a penalty term to reduce the influence of outliers and to promote the universality of the results we found that the contribution rate of each factor to the variation of runoff and sediment load has changed continuously over past decades since the 1950s the contribution rate of climate change anthropogenic activities has decreased increased from 1954 1959 to 2000 2015 the contribution rate of climate change with precipitation reduction as the main factor influencing runoff sediment reduction was 35 34 and the contribution rate of anthropogenic activities was 65 66 among the various anthropogenic interventions the contribution rate of channel measures to runoff reduction is close to that of slope measures while the sediment reduction effect of channel measures 39 is greater than that of slope measures 27 the impact of slope measures has been greater on runoff reduction than on sediment reduction whereas the impact of channel measures has been greater on sediment reduction than on runoff reduction among the four slope measures the contribution rate of afforestation has been greatest because both channel measures and slope measures have contributed to considerable runoff and sediment decrease we recommend that further expansion of soil and water conservation measures be studied carefully with regard to
