16410,piezoelectric effect was firstly employed to improve dewatering efficiency of sludge it was found that the piezoelectric effect could be driven directly by the pressure of pressure filtration process without any additional energy this piezo dewatering process coupled piezoelectric effect with pressure filtration could efficiently remove moisture of sludge under 0 6 mpa for 2 h moisture content mc and weight of sludge could be reduced to 63 9 and 3 2 g from 96 7 and 50 g by the piezo dewatering process with 0 45 g t batio3 this piezo dewatering efficiency was much higher than that of usual conditioning pressure filtrations using cao fecl3 or polyacrylamide pam as the conditioners and the piezo dewatering process assisted by pam could further decrease mc and weight of the sludge to 54 9 and 2 1 g correspondingly which complied to the advanced dewatering requirement mc 60 the favorable piezo dewatering efficiency was contributed to the piezo catalytic oxidation and the electric role of remnant piezo field the finding of this piezo dewatering mechanism offered an inspiring look at developing the emerging dewatering technology graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sludge dewatering piezocatalysis piezo conditioning 1 introduction sewage sludge is a kind of inevitable by product in biological treatment process of wastewater recently its production has been continuously growing all over the world with the increasing of sanitation and water treatment facilities for example the sewage sludge production of china has reached to 11 75 million ton dry matters dms in 2019 wu et al 2020 the united states has an average annual sewage sludge production of 17 8 million ton dms in the last decade wu et al 2020 european union has around 9 0 million ton dms per year wu et al 2020 generally the moisture content mc of sewage sludge is quite high ranging about 99 5 65 accordingly so dewatering is necessary to remove most of their moisture prasad et al 2019 its aims are not only to reduce the sludge volume for facilitating its transport and handling but also to comply to the requirement of subsequent disposal reutilization for instance in many districts the mc of sludge is restricted to lower than 50 for incineration ge et al 2019a ge et al 2019b lin et al 2020 and to less than 60 for composting ge et al 2019a ge et al 2019b lin et al 2020 however except for free water bound waters interstitial water vicinal water hydration water and intracellular water are difficult to be deeply removed from sludge by a simple mechanical dewatering process because they are physically or and chemically bound with sludge vesilind 1994 accordingly the issue of sludge dewatering has aroused great concern of management departments and scientific research society recently conventionally sludge dewatering includes two steps conditioning and liquid solid separation at least after gravitational settling the conditioning is to improve the dewaterability of sludge through various pretreatments such as freezing thawing mechanical disintegration coagulation flocculation acid or alkaline treatment and advanced oxidization prasad et al 2019 the liquid solid separation is to drive water to leave from the conditioned sludge mainly through the mechanical process such as pressure filtration and centrifugation although the two steps are both important for sludge dewatering recently much effort has been paid to the sludge pretreatment processes with the potential of advanced conditioning such as acid alkaline treatment thermolysis wu et al 2021 mechanical disintegration nah et al 2000 specially advanced oxidation processes aops and their combination processes cao et al 2021 chen et al 2016 erkan et al 2019 guan et al 2018 wu et al 2020 they could effectively improve dewaterability of sludge by deeply disrupting floc eps extracellular polymeric substances and even cell structures of sludge releasing bound water of sludge parts of them have been applied in full scale for example thermolysis plant has started up in norway kepp et al 2000 sonication and ozonization have also been industrially implemented in some countries chu et al 2009 pilli et al 2011 rittmann et al 2008 however the demand for more chemicals or energy consumption limits their commercially popular application wu et al 2020 zhou et al 2015 for example the dosage of many aops conditioning reached as high as 50 wt dry weight of raw sludge wu et al 2020 thus it is a challenge to develop a more cost effective and advanced dewatering technology for sludge piezoelectric effect was discovered in 1880 by brothers p curie and j curie is a physical phenomenon between the interaction conversions of mechanical energy and electric energy the conversions are mediated by the deformed piezoelectric semiconductors by an external pressure in which electric energy exists in piezo potential it has been widely used for sensors transducers actuators and energy harvesters for self powered devices etc since hong s group found that the piezoelectric effect of nano zno and batio3 could drive the oxidation reduction reactions in aqueous medium hong et al 2010 2012 as a new application of piezoelectric effect piezocatalysis has attracted much attention of the environmental research field this is partly because it can be switched by smaller scale energy typically in the range of μw mw wang et al 2021a wang et al 2021b so far the fast development of piezocatalysis has been witnessed in water splitting li et al 2019 su et al 2021 h2o2 generation lv et al 2017 shao et al 2018 sterilization feng et al 2018 tooth whitening wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b tumor therapy zhu et al 2020 and specially pollutant degradation lan et al 2017 lan et al 2020 liu et al al 2019 zhao et al 2008 however the piezocatalysis as an emerging advanced oxidation technology has still been not used to sludge dewatering simply piezocatalysis is divided into two steps piezo physical process and piezo chemical process in the former piezo potential polarized charges on the two opposite surfaces of piezo material is created with deformation of the nano piezomaterial caused by external mechanical pressure in the latter the as formed piezo potential drives the free carriers of piezo material to cross the piezoelectric solution interface and triggers advanced oxidation reactions in aqueous solution consequently in essence the piezo advanced oxidation processes are driven by the external mechanical pressure while piezo material only acts as an energy converter and catalyst it was noticed that at present the solid liquid separation pressure filtration in sludge dewatering is also carried out by the extrusion of water from sludge due to the application of external mechanical pressure predictably if the piezo material was evenly added in sludge piezocatalysis will occur parallel to pressure filtration of the sludge and moreover the piezocatalysis like other aops will possible act as an effective chemical conditioning and improve the dewatering of sludge but without any additional energy the expectation prompted us to launch a new research project to improve sludge dewatering by piezoelectric effect in which the piezoelectric process was driven directly by the pressure of pressure filtration considering that the conditioning and pressure filtration dewatering of sludge was completed in one step in the same device the whole process was referenced as piezo dewatering for the sake of simplicity in the present paper a typical green piezo material tetragonal batio3 t bt was used as a piezo dewatering agent of sludge as a preliminary investigation main work would be focused on probing the feasibility effectiveness and characteristics of the piezo dewatering a special attention would be paid to understand the mechanism of the piezo dewatering the aims of these investigations were to develop a high efficient and energy saving process of sludge advanced dewatering in addition to the proof of concept of piezo dewatering 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge and materials raw sludge was waste

used t bt was obtained by the calcination of commercial batio3 at 800 c for 2 h in muffle oven the abbreviations were listed in table s1 2 2 sludge piezo dewatering process the sludge piezo dewatering was performed on a lab scale pressure filtration setup driven by compressed air the set up mainly consisted of an air compressor a piston a filter medium and a cylindrical vessel with a diameter of 100 mm and a maximum height of 130 mm as shown in fig 1 the piezo dewatering procedure was similar to that of usual plate and frame type filter press after sludge and t bt were uniformly mixed the mixed sludge was added into the pressure filtration device then the air compressor was started and performed piezo dewatering the resulting sludge was recorded as sludge cake and it included the dewatered sludge and residual conditioners in an optimal piezo dewatering test the used raw sludge was 50 g t bt and pam dosage were 0 45 g and 0 005 g individually and the pressure and time of pressure filtration were set to 0 6 mpa and 2 h respectively main parameters of other tests were listed in table s2 2 3 characterization x ray diffraction xrd patterns of batio3 powders were

sludge and mda total phosphorus tp total organic carbon toc of the press filter liquor through 0 45 μm filter membrane in them mc was defined by 1 mc w 1 w 2 w 1 100 where w1 was the weight of wet sludge and w2 was the weight of dry sludge after drying at 105 c to a constant weight the disintegration degree dd of sludge was an usual indictor to quantitatively evaluated the physical and chemical destruction efficiency of sludge subjected to treatment it could be calculated using the following formula abelleira et al 2012 kim et al 2010 2 dd sco d t sco d 0 tco d 0 sco d 0 100 where scod0 and scodt were the soluble chemical oxygen demand in the supernatant before and after piezo dewatering treatment respectively tcod0 was the total chemical oxygen demand in the sludge mixture before

science press beijing china 2002 all soluble substances were analyzed with the filtrate samples through a 0 45 mm membrane 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of batio3 fig 2 showed xrd spectra of the calcined commercial batio3 at various temperatures for 2 h six well defined diffraction peaks at 2θ 22 1 31 6 39 0 45 2 56 2 and 66 0 were observed in the xrd spectra of original commercial batio3 the characteristics of these peaks were consistent with that of cubic batio3 c bt jcpdf 31 0714 as the calcination temperature elevated the diffraction peak at 45 2 was slowly evolved asymmetric and finally split into two small peaks with 2θ 45 1 and 45 3 at 800 c as shown in the inset of fig 2a their diffraction characterizations were in accordance with that of 002 and 200 crystal planes of t bt jcpdf 05 0626 in other words commercial batio3 was gradually converted from c bt to t bt in the thermal treatment fig 2b through the analysis by jade 6 5 the lattice constants of un and calcined commercial batio3 at 800 c were a b 4 006 å c 4 006 å c a 1 and a b 4 010 å c 4 051 å c a 1 010 respectively by calculating with their lattice parameters begg et al 1994 the content of t bt was 90 5 after calcination of commercial batio3 at 800 c for 2 h fig 2b the thermal treatment could not only tune the crystal phase but also observably regulate the other physical properties as shown in the sem photographs fig 3 a the original commercial batio3 particles were globular like the mean crystal grain size was 29 1 nm achieved by calculation with the xrd parameters and scherrer equation as the calcination temperature rose from 25 c to 800 c the mean crystal grain size increased to 42 2 nm growth of batio3 particle could also be observed in sem photographs fig 3a and 3b the remarkable increase of the crystal grain size could be contributed to the aggregation of batio3 crystal grains due to the fusion of particle interfaces during the thermal treatment li et al 2015 wang et al 2006a wang et al 2006b zhang et al 2005 fig 3c and 3d presented pfm maps of the commercial and calcined commercial batio3 it could be seen that the calcined batio3 particles displayed a max piezo potential of 16 3 mv while the original commercial batio3 had no distinctly piezoelectric response the difference of their piezo potential was consistent with the conversion of c bt to t bt in the calcination of commercial batio3 as identified by the xrd characterization the pfm response of the calcined commercial batio3 still exhibited a well defined phase voltage hysteresis and obviously symmetric amplitude voltage butterfly loop fig 3f but the original commercial batio3 did not fig 3e these pfm response characteristics verified that the calcined commercial batio3 possessed not only excellent piezoelectric and ferroelectric activity but also stronger remnant piezo field in its particles 3 2 piezo dewatering of sludge verification of piezo conditioning in principle the piezo dewatering could also be divided into two steps conditioning and pressure filtration as general dewatering however actually its conditioning and pressure filtration were combined together in which piezoelectric effect was directly initialed with the pressure of pressure filtration thus it was difficult to individually characterize the piezo conditioning process as usual in this protocol the piezo conditioning effect was indirectly evaluated with characteristics of sludge cakes as possible fig 4 a presented mc and weight of these sludge cakes through the pressure filtration processes without and with t bt it could be seen from the figure that the two processes could both decrease the mc and weight of sludge but the latter possessed a higher dewatering efficiency than the former the mc and weight of sludge cake through the former process were 85 2 and 12 9 g correspondingly while those of sludge cake through the latter process were as low as 63 9 and 3 2 g respectively table s2 and simultaneously the raw sludge was both turned into a thin sludge cake however the latter seemed more fragile than the former as shown in fig 4b these great differences between the two sludge cakes manifestly indicated that t bt took play in the role of a conditioner in the sludge dewatering however it was noticed that c bt did not show significant conditioning effect for sludge dewatering as displayed in fig 4a the mc of sludge cake through the pressure filtration process in the presence of c bt was as high as 84 9 similar to that through the free conditioner pressure filtration process as we known although t bt and c bt were both barium titanate the former possessed stronger piezoelectric activity while the latter did not fig 3c 3f these differences of their conditioning effect for sludge well agreed with the divergence of their piezoelectric characteristics therefore the conditioning role of t bt was possibly dependent on its piezoelectric effect the inference was further confirmed by the change of conditioning effect of c bt subjected to the thermal treatment as shown in fig 4b the calcination of c bt could improve its dewatering efficiency and the improvement increased with rising of calcination temperature the change was basically consistent with the conversion of c bt to t bt with piezoelectric activity as shown in fig 2c these experimental results further confirmed that the conditioning role of t bt for sludge stemmed from its piezoelectric effect moreover this conditioning role was much stronger than that of pam as an excellent conditioner frequently used in actual sludge dewatering processes the mc of sludge cake through pressure filtration process with t bt was 9 0 less than that through the pressure filtration process with pam as presented in fig 4a and table s2 accordingly the piezo dewatering process deserved further investigation 3 3 advanced piezo dewatering assisted with pam although single t bt piezo conditioning could significantly improve the dewatering efficiency of sludge comparing with simple pressure filtration the mc of its sludge cake was still slightly over 60 which did not accord with the requirement of the current advanced dewatering cao et al 2021 ge et al 2020 lin et al 2020 thus the advanced piezo dewatering performance of t bt assisted with various coagulants or flocculants was also investigated because the co conditioning of aops with coagulation or flocculants was frequently used to advanced dewatering chen et al 2016 ge et al 2019a ge et al 2019b ge et al 2020 it was found that these tested coagulants or flocculants could all assist t bt to enhance piezo dewatering efficiency but their enhancement degree was different as displayed in fig 5 a co conditioning of 0 005 g pam and 0 45 g t bt could reduce mc of sludge cake to 54 9 while the same amount of cao or fecl3 and t bt only reduced it to 62 4 and 61 5 that is the combination of t bt and pam possessed a more favorable co conditioning effect than others and could make the mc of sludge cake comply the requirement of the advanced dewatering 60 consequently the advanced piezo dewatering of sludge assisted with pam was further investigated below fig 5b presented mcs of sludge cake for the various dosage of t bt in the presence of 0 005 g pam it could be seen from the figure that the mc decreased rapidly at the first and then changed slightly as the dosage increased its breakpoint corresponded to 0 45 g t bt and 54 9 mc the rapid reduction of mc could be simply attributed to increase of the piezoelectric active sites as amount of t bt increased the little change denoted that the efficiency of piezo dewatering was possibly dependent on the type of these removed waters in addition to the dosage of piezo materials because it was well known that bound water was difficult to remove vesilind et al 1994 fig 5c showed the dependence of dewatering efficiency with the time of pressure filtration for the optimal dosage of conditioners mc of sludge cake decreased rapidly at first then decreased slowly and only changed slightly after about 120 min showing a three phase variation characteristic the features might also depend on the type of squeezed out water according to shi and zhou et als investigations shi et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 the first stage was dependent on removal of free waters because they were less influenced by its solid matrix and easily removed and squeezed out the second stage involved the removal of partial bound waters the final stage was related to the slow removal of residual bound water tight to sludge such as vicinal water intracellular water and hydration water the reduction of sludge weight in the first stage of piezo dewatering processes with t bt and t bt pam were 82 3 and 86 2 weight of raw sludge individually as shown in the inset of fig 5c they both obviously exceeded the content of free water in raw sludge 72 1 this result showed that in the first stage some of the bound water were also removed in addition to free water the difference among this result and zhou and shi et als investigations might originate from the piezoelectric effect of t bt fig 5d presented the dependences of dewatering efficiency on the set final pressure of pressure filtration with t bt or c bt and pam as expected dewatering performance of sludge was intensively dependent on the pressure of pressure filtration mc of the sludge cake from pressure filtration with t bt rapidly decreased at first and then slowly changed after 0 6 mpa displaying a nonlinear curve although mc of the sludge cake from pressure filtration with c bt also presented a nonlinear curve as pressure increased the shape of two curves was considerably different in the range of pressure 0 1 mpa they basically overlapped after 0 1 mpa their difference rapidly increased and finally reached to 17 1 the inset of fig 5d because c bt possessed no piezo active and t bt possessed strong piezo active the overlapping of two curves under 0 1 mpa denoted that the dewatering under low pressure was mainly for the mechanically squeezing effect of pressure not for piezoelectric effect the significant difference of two curves after 0 1 mpa was reasonably attributed to the piezoelectric effect of t bt it was also noticed that the increase of difference was proportional to the applied pressure but not linear inset of fig 5d the change of increase was not completely consistent with the linear relationship between piezoelectric potential and pressure as shown in the below formula feng et al 2017 wu et al 2016 3 v p τ y d xy w x ε rx ε 0 where vp is the piezo potential τy is the applied stress in y direction dxy is the piezoelectric coefficient wx is the length of the all add upped cell unit in the x direction εrx is the relative permittivity in x direction and ε0 represented the permittivity of free space this inconsistence might depend on the changes in type of the removed water with extent of deepening dewatering as mentioned above the advanced dewatering involved a variety of bound water that was more difficult to extrude than free water 3 4 possible mechanism of t bt piezo dewatering disintegration of sludge by piezoelectric effect the sludge is an aggregate of biomass inorganics and water with complex networks it is crucial to disintegrate these aggregates for deep dewatering of sludge although there are still some disagreements about what is the most appropriate dd value of sludge for the perspective of filterability wang et al 2006a wang et al 2006b wu et al 2020 fig 6 a presented the changes of sludge dd in the three conditioning pressure filtration processes the dd values increased faster as time of pressure filtration increased and finally reached 32 6 for t bt added sludge it was slightly less than that of fenton oxidation but much higher than that of free fluctuant pam and coagulant fecl3 conditioned sludge also higher than many reported dd values of aops conditioned sludge erkan et al 2019 2020 li et al 2021 lippert et al 2020 because dd is often used as an indicator of the dewaterability of conditioned sludge it was reasonably believed that the significantly enhanced dewatering effect of t bt was dependent on its strong disintegrating ability to sludge it was still observed from fig 6a that the dd of c bt added sludge was no apparent change comparing with that of unconditioned sludge this fact suggested that the enhancement of sludge disintegration was originated from the piezoelectric effect of t bt the suggestion was further supported by the increase of tp and toc in filtrate of t bt conditioned sludge comparing with that of the free conditioner sludge fig 6c and 6d although it is difficult to accurately determine the composition and structure of each substance in these filtrates the types of main substance could be characterized by 3d eem fluorescence spectra of these filtrates yang et al 2020 as shown in fig 7 three eem fluorescence peaks were observed both for filtrates of the free and t bt conditioning pressure filtration the peak 1 λex λem 225 nm 345 nm could be assigned to the aromatic protein like substances peak 2 λex λem 225 nm 470 nm was related to the fulvic acid like materials and peak 3 λex λem 350 nm 435 nm was from the humic acid like substances yang et al 2020 although the peaks of two eem fluorescence spectra both located in similar regions their peak intensities of fig 7b were much higher than that of fig 7a in other words the leakage of fulvic acid like and humic acid like especially aromatic protein like substances increased with t bt conditioning obviously the leakage was caused by the piezoelectric effect of t bt the increase of fluorescence substance was possibly from the disintegrated eps and also possibly from inside of the damaged cells in order to clarify the origins the filtrate samples were determined as an indicator of oxidation of cell membrane fan et al 2020 feng et al 2020 graf et al 2019 fig 6b displayed the change of mda concentration in the three dewatering processes conditioner free c bt and t bt added pressure filtrations the concentration of mda only slightly increased with time in the first two pressure filtration processes while addition of t bt resulted in a rapid increase of mda which reached a peak value of 3 82 mmol l at 60 min and then slowly decreased this significant increase of mda implied that the cell membranes of sludge were seriously damaged and the decrease was possibly due to the further oxidation decomposition of mda in the process of t bt added pressure filtration was similar to sökmen et als observation sökmen et al 2001 the damage of cell membranes was further intuitively confirmed by the change of sem images of sludge cells in the process of pressure filtration as indicated in fig s1 an intact cell before treatment was like a rod shape with a smooth surface after piezo conditioning and pressure filtration for 120 min they were changed into fragments with a rougher surface and potholes indicating that the cell membrane ruptures generally the disruption of microbial cells was more difficult in the usual conditionings due to the protect role of eps outside the cell thus the apparent damage of cell membranes denoted that the piezoelectric effect of t bt could deeply disintegrated sludge even eps and cell structures because these fluorescence substances in the filtrate originated mainly from both eps and cells the disintegration could improve the sludge dewaterability because the release of intracellular and floc block substances has been well proven to be beneficial to conversion of bound water to free water in sludge he et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 in addition it s worth mentioning that cod in the sewage of south china was generally lower if the filtrate containing these substances were flowed back to the sewage its carbon source would increase which would have a positive impact on denitrification in sewage treatment pathways of piezo conditioning generally the oxidation of sludge was related to the occurrence of ros in its conditioning process ge et al 2019a ge et al 2019b ge et al 2020 lin et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 therefore several typical ros in the filtrates from the three pressure filtration processes were detected in order to understand the mechanism of t bt piezo conditioning and sludge piezo dewatering fig 8 a presented a well defined 4 fold esr peak with an intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 for t bt piezo conditioning pressure filtration process which was consistent with the esr characteristics of oh while no apparent esr response was observed for free conditioning and c bt conditioning pressure filtration processes a similar situation was also witnessed in the esr spectra of o2 and 1o2 fig 8b and 8c additionally another ros h2o2 was quantitatively determined as shown in fig 8d the concentration of h2o2 strikingly increased with time of pressure filtration and reached 91 2 μmol l at 120 min for t bt conditioning pressure filtration process but no significant h2o2 was detected for free piezo material and c bt conditioning pressure filtration processes these observations confirmed that the pressure of pressure filtration could drive nano piezo material t bt to catalytically generate various ros this was the first example about the piezocatalysis switched directly by pressure of pressure filtration although the sonication excited piezocatalysis was frequently reported hong et al 2010 wang et al 2021a wang et al 2021b zhu et al 2020 as mentioned above the increase of fulvic acid like humic acid like and aromatic protein like especially mda was dependent on oxidation disintegration of these ros for sludge jyoti and pandit 2003 nguyen et al 2013 in order to estimate the contribution magnitudes of above various ros to the sludge disintegration the experiments about activity depressing of these radicals were performed by adding corresponding radical scavengers han et al 2011 xiao et al 2016 yao et al 2014 as shown in fig 9 the addition of p bq or nan3 as a scavenger of o2 and 1o2 individually could only slightly depress dd of t bt added sludge and the depress ratio was ca 5 8 and 2 2 respectively for 10 mmol l p bq or nan3 while the addition of tba as oh scavenger could drastically decrease dd of t bt added sludge for example for 10 mmol l tba the dd of sludge decreased to 16 9 within 120 min which was only half of that of free t bt added sludge these experimental results manifested that the enhanced effect on sludge disintegration and dewatering of t bt was mainly due to oxidation of oh from t bt piezo catalytic process which was similar to the reported mechanisms of many other aops conditioning for sludge liang et al 2020 mo1 et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 additionally due to no suitable scavenger for h2o2 its contribution was not quantitatively determined it was reported to possess stronger inactivation role than that of ros for bacteria although oxidizability of h2o2 was much weaker than that of oh radical it was because h2o2 possessed a longer lifetime and could permeate inside cell while oh radical mainly oxidized their cell membrane xia et al 2015 hence it was reasonable to believe that h2o2 also took an important role in the sludge disintegration it was noticed that after subjected to piezo dewatering the zeta potential of sludge increased from 25 6 mv to 19 1 mv the increase value was less than that of the conditioned sludge by usual coagulation and or flocculation liang et al 2019 wang et al 2018 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 the small change of zeta potential was possibly dependent on the characteristics of piezo dewatering process the current researches about piezocatalysis were basically focused on intrinsic free carrier involved catalytic reactions however it has been recently found that the intrinsic free charge carriers in piezo materials were few and could not completely balance piezoelectric charges therefore there was a remnant piezoelectric field in the strained piezo material hao et al 2018 huang et al 2017 referring to the principle of chemical conditioning the positive and negative charges of remnant piezo field possibly electrically neutralized with charged sludge particles reducing their zeta potential and improving the dewaterability of the sludge but according to the piezoelectric theory the piezo field of t bt existed only under stress i e in extrusion of pressure filtration if the sludge cake was taken out of pressure filtration the piezoelectric effect of t bt disappeared and simultaneously the electric neutralization effect of its remnant piezo field also vanished consequently and the zeta potential of its sludge particles increased leading to the reduction of zeta potential difference between raw sludge and sludge cake in order to confirm this conditioning effect of the remnant piezo field t bt was coated with vitrified sio2 t bt sio2 to prevent the transfer of free carriers in t bt to external environment that is to depress piezocatalysis it could be seen from fig s2 that after t bt sio2 added sludge was subjected to pressure filtration for 60 min the mc of its sludge cake was 74 1 being 6 0 and 6 9 less than that of the sludge cake from c bt added and free conditioner sludge respectively this fact exhibited that a part of piezo conditioning role stemmed from the filed effect of the remnant piezoelectric filed of t bt in addition to its piezocatalysis although it was difficult to completely clarify the conditioning mechanism of remnant piezoelectric field at present at least the remnant piezoelectric field could be expected to generate electric neutralization effect with sludge particles according to the usual principle of electricity fig 10 combined with above experimental observations and analysis it could be concluded that the piezoelectric effect conditioned the sludge by two pathways the catalytic oxidation of piezo generating ros specially oh radicals and the electric effect of remnant piezo field in process of pressure filtration the piezo conditioning mechanism was schematically presented below 4 conclusions a new sludge dewatering process piezo dewatering was proposed and investigated it could be directly switched by the pressure of pressure filtration without any additional energy the mc and weight of sludge were reduced from 96 7 0 9 to 63 9 and from 50 g to 3 2 g respectively by piezo dewatering of 0 45 g t bt under 0 6 mpa for 2 h and the piezo dewatering process assisted with 0 005 g pam could further reduce mc to less than 60 which complied to the requirement of advanced dewatering the favorable piezo dewatering effect of t bt was confirmed by two conditioning pathways the catalytic oxidation of piezo generating ros and the electric effect of remnant piezo field these investigation results not only offered a new alternative for sludge advanced dewatering but also extended the application of electric piezoelectric effect and deepened the understanding of sludge dewatering mechanism however from the perspective of practical application the piezo dewatering technology was still in its infancy and many issues need further research such

16410,piezoelectric effect was firstly employed to improve dewatering efficiency of sludge it was found that the piezoelectric effect could be driven directly by the pressure of pressure filtration process without any additional energy this piezo dewatering process coupled piezoelectric effect with pressure filtration could efficiently remove moisture of sludge under 0 6 mpa for 2 h moisture content mc and weight of sludge could be reduced to 63 9 and 3 2 g from 96 7 and 50 g by the piezo dewatering process with 0 45 g t batio3 this piezo dewatering efficiency was much higher than that of usual conditioning pressure filtrations using cao fecl3 or polyacrylamide pam as the conditioners and the piezo dewatering process assisted by pam could further decrease mc and weight of the sludge to 54 9 and 2 1 g correspondingly which complied to the advanced dewatering requirement mc 60 the favorable piezo dewatering efficiency was contributed to the piezo catalytic oxidation and the electric role of remnant piezo field the finding of this piezo dewatering mechanism offered an inspiring look at developing the emerging dewatering technology graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sludge dewatering piezocatalysis piezo conditioning 1 introduction sewage sludge is a kind of inevitable by product in biological treatment process of wastewater recently its production has been continuously growing all over the world with the increasing of sanitation and water treatment facilities for example the sewage sludge production of china has reached to 11 75 million ton dry matters dms in 2019 wu et al 2020 the united states has an average annual sewage sludge production of 17 8 million ton dms in the last decade wu et al 2020 european union has around 9 0 million ton dms per year wu et al 2020 generally the moisture content mc of sewage sludge is quite high ranging about 99 5 65 accordingly so dewatering is necessary to remove most of their moisture prasad et al 2019 its aims are not only to reduce the sludge volume for facilitating its transport and handling but also to comply to the requirement of subsequent disposal reutilization for instance in many districts the mc of sludge is restricted to lower than 50 for incineration ge et al 2019a ge et al 2019b lin et al 2020 and to less than 60 for composting ge et al 2019a ge et al 2019b lin et al 2020 however except for free water bound waters interstitial water vicinal water hydration water and intracellular water are difficult to be deeply removed from sludge by a simple mechanical dewatering process because they are physically or and chemically bound with sludge vesilind 1994 accordingly the issue of sludge dewatering has aroused great concern of management departments and scientific research society recently conventionally sludge dewatering includes two steps conditioning and liquid solid separation at least after gravitational settling the conditioning is to improve the dewaterability of sludge through various pretreatments such as freezing thawing mechanical disintegration coagulation flocculation acid or alkaline treatment and advanced oxidization prasad et al 2019 the liquid solid separation is to drive water to leave from the conditioned sludge mainly through the mechanical process such as pressure filtration and centrifugation although the two steps are both important for sludge dewatering recently much effort has been paid to the sludge pretreatment processes with the potential of advanced conditioning such as acid alkaline treatment thermolysis wu et al 2021 mechanical disintegration nah et al 2000 specially advanced oxidation processes aops and their combination processes cao et al 2021 chen et al 2016 erkan et al 2019 guan et al 2018 wu et al 2020 they could effectively improve dewaterability of sludge by deeply disrupting floc eps extracellular polymeric substances and even cell structures of sludge releasing bound water of sludge parts of them have been applied in full scale for example thermolysis plant has started up in norway kepp et al 2000 sonication and ozonization have also been industrially implemented in some countries chu et al 2009 pilli et al 2011 rittmann et al 2008 however the demand for more chemicals or energy consumption limits their commercially popular application wu et al 2020 zhou et al 2015 for example the dosage of many aops conditioning reached as high as 50 wt dry weight of raw sludge wu et al 2020 thus it is a challenge to develop a more cost effective and advanced dewatering technology for sludge piezoelectric effect was discovered in 1880 by brothers p curie and j curie is a physical phenomenon between the interaction conversions of mechanical energy and electric energy the conversions are mediated by the deformed piezoelectric semiconductors by an external pressure in which electric energy exists in piezo potential it has been widely used for sensors transducers actuators and energy harvesters for self powered devices etc since hong s group found that the piezoelectric effect of nano zno and batio3 could drive the oxidation reduction reactions in aqueous medium hong et al 2010 2012 as a new application of piezoelectric effect piezocatalysis has attracted much attention of the environmental research field this is partly because it can be switched by smaller scale energy typically in the range of μw mw wang et al 2021a wang et al 2021b so far the fast development of piezocatalysis has been witnessed in water splitting li et al 2019 su et al 2021 h2o2 generation lv et al 2017 shao et al 2018 sterilization feng et al 2018 tooth whitening wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b tumor therapy zhu et al 2020 and specially pollutant degradation lan et al 2017 lan et al 2020 liu et al al 2019 zhao et al 2008 however the piezocatalysis as an emerging advanced oxidation technology has still been not used to sludge dewatering simply piezocatalysis is divided into two steps piezo physical process and piezo chemical process in the former piezo potential polarized charges on the two opposite surfaces of piezo material is created with deformation of the nano piezomaterial caused by external mechanical pressure in the latter the as formed piezo potential drives the free carriers of piezo material to cross the piezoelectric solution interface and triggers advanced oxidation reactions in aqueous solution consequently in essence the piezo advanced oxidation processes are driven by the external mechanical pressure while piezo material only acts as an energy converter and catalyst it was noticed that at present the solid liquid separation pressure filtration in sludge dewatering is also carried out by the extrusion of water from sludge due to the application of external mechanical pressure predictably if the piezo material was evenly added in sludge piezocatalysis will occur parallel to pressure filtration of the sludge and moreover the piezocatalysis like other aops will possible act as an effective chemical conditioning and improve the dewatering of sludge but without any additional energy the expectation prompted us to launch a new research project to improve sludge dewatering by piezoelectric effect in which the piezoelectric process was driven directly by the pressure of pressure filtration considering that the conditioning and pressure filtration dewatering of sludge was completed in one step in the same device the whole process was referenced as piezo dewatering for the sake of simplicity in the present paper a typical green piezo material tetragonal batio3 t bt was used as a piezo dewatering agent of sludge as a preliminary investigation main work would be focused on probing the feasibility effectiveness and characteristics of the piezo dewatering a special attention would be paid to understand the mechanism of the piezo dewatering the aims of these investigations were to develop a high efficient and energy saving process of sludge advanced dewatering in addition to the proof of concept of piezo dewatering 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge and materials raw sludge was waste

was performed on a lab scale pressure filtration setup driven by compressed air the set up mainly consisted of an air compressor a piston a filter medium and a cylindrical vessel with a diameter of 100 mm and a maximum height of 130 mm as shown in fig 1 the piezo dewatering procedure was similar to that of usual plate and frame type filter press after sludge and t bt were uniformly mixed the mixed sludge was added into the pressure filtration device then the air compressor was started and performed piezo dewatering the resulting sludge was recorded as sludge cake and it included the dewatered sludge and residual conditioners in an optimal piezo dewatering test the used raw sludge was 50 g t bt and pam dosage were 0 45 g and 0 005 g individually and the pressure and time of pressure filtration were set to 0 6 mpa and 2 h respectively main parameters of other tests were listed in table s2 2 3 characterization x ray diffraction xrd patterns of batio3 powders were

science press beijing china 2002 all soluble substances were analyzed with the filtrate samples through a 0 45 mm membrane 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of batio3 fig 2 showed xrd spectra of the calcined commercial batio3 at various temperatures for 2 h six well defined diffraction peaks at 2θ 22 1 31 6 39 0 45 2 56 2 and 66 0 were observed in the xrd spectra of original commercial batio3 the characteristics of these peaks were consistent with that of cubic batio3 c bt jcpdf 31 0714 as the calcination temperature elevated the diffraction peak at 45 2 was slowly evolved asymmetric and finally split into two small peaks with 2θ 45 1 and 45 3 at 800 c as shown in the inset of fig 2a their diffraction characterizations were in accordance with that of 002 and 200 crystal planes of t bt jcpdf 05 0626 in other words commercial batio3 was gradually converted from c bt to t bt in the thermal treatment fig 2b through the analysis by jade 6 5 the lattice constants of un and calcined commercial batio3 at 800 c were a b 4 006 å c 4 006 å c a 1 and a b 4 010 å c 4 051 å c a 1 010 respectively by calculating with their lattice parameters begg et al 1994 the content of t bt was 90 5 after calcination of commercial batio3 at 800 c for 2 h fig 2b the thermal treatment could not only tune the crystal phase but also observably regulate the other physical properties as shown in the sem photographs fig 3 a the original commercial batio3 particles were globular like the mean crystal grain size was 29 1 nm achieved by calculation with the xrd parameters and scherrer equation as the calcination temperature rose from 25 c to 800 c the mean crystal grain size increased to 42 2 nm growth of batio3 particle could also be observed in sem photographs fig 3a and 3b the remarkable increase of the crystal grain size could be contributed to the aggregation of batio3 crystal grains due to the fusion of particle interfaces during the thermal treatment li et al 2015 wang et al 2006a wang et al 2006b zhang et al 2005 fig 3c and 3d presented pfm maps of the commercial and calcined commercial batio3 it could be seen that the calcined batio3 particles displayed a max piezo potential of 16 3 mv while the original commercial batio3 had no distinctly piezoelectric response the difference of their piezo potential was consistent with the conversion of c bt to t bt in the calcination of commercial batio3 as identified by the xrd characterization the pfm response of the calcined commercial batio3 still exhibited a well defined phase voltage hysteresis and obviously symmetric amplitude voltage butterfly loop fig 3f but the original commercial batio3 did not fig 3e these pfm response characteristics verified that the calcined commercial batio3 possessed not only excellent piezoelectric and ferroelectric activity but also stronger remnant piezo field in its particles 3 2 piezo dewatering of sludge verification of piezo conditioning in principle the piezo dewatering could also be divided into two steps conditioning and pressure filtration as general dewatering however actually its conditioning and pressure filtration were combined together in which piezoelectric effect was directly initialed with the pressure of pressure filtration thus it was difficult to individually characterize the piezo conditioning process as usual in this protocol the piezo conditioning effect was indirectly evaluated with characteristics of sludge cakes as possible fig 4 a presented mc and weight of these sludge cakes through the pressure filtration processes without and with t bt it could be seen from the figure that the two processes could both decrease the mc and weight of sludge but the latter possessed a higher dewatering efficiency than the former the mc and weight of sludge cake through the former process were 85 2 and 12 9 g correspondingly while those of sludge cake through the latter process were as low as 63 9 and 3 2 g respectively table s2 and simultaneously the raw sludge was both turned into a thin sludge cake however the latter seemed more fragile than the former as shown in fig 4b these great differences between the two sludge cakes manifestly indicated that t bt took play in the role of a conditioner in the sludge dewatering however it was noticed that c bt did not show significant conditioning effect for sludge dewatering as displayed in fig 4a the mc of sludge cake through the pressure filtration process in the presence of c bt was as high as 84 9 similar to that through the free conditioner pressure filtration process as we known although t bt and c bt were both barium titanate the former possessed stronger piezoelectric activity while the latter did not fig 3c 3f these differences of their conditioning effect for sludge well agreed with the divergence of their piezoelectric characteristics therefore the conditioning role of t bt was possibly dependent on its piezoelectric effect the inference was further confirmed by the change of conditioning effect of c bt subjected to the thermal treatment as shown in fig 4b the calcination of c bt could improve its dewatering efficiency and the improvement increased with rising of calcination temperature the change was basically consistent with the conversion of c bt to t bt with piezoelectric activity as shown in fig 2c these experimental results further confirmed that the conditioning role of t bt for sludge stemmed from its piezoelectric effect moreover this conditioning role was much stronger than that of pam as an excellent conditioner frequently used in actual sludge dewatering processes the mc of sludge cake through pressure filtration process with t bt was 9 0 less than that through the pressure filtration process with pam as presented in fig 4a and table s2 accordingly the piezo dewatering process deserved further investigation 3 3 advanced piezo dewatering assisted with pam although single t bt piezo conditioning could significantly improve the dewatering efficiency of sludge comparing with simple pressure filtration the mc of its sludge cake was still slightly over 60 which did not accord with the requirement of the current advanced dewatering cao et al 2021 ge et al 2020 lin et al 2020 thus the advanced piezo dewatering performance of t bt assisted with various coagulants or flocculants was also investigated because the co conditioning of aops with coagulation or flocculants was frequently used to advanced dewatering chen et al 2016 ge et al 2019a ge et al 2019b ge et al 2020 it was found that these tested coagulants or flocculants could all assist t bt to enhance piezo dewatering efficiency but their enhancement degree was different as displayed in fig 5 a co conditioning of 0 005 g pam and 0 45 g t bt could reduce mc of sludge cake to 54 9 while the same amount of cao or fecl3 and t bt only reduced it to 62 4 and 61 5 that is the combination of t bt and pam possessed a more favorable co conditioning effect than others and could make the mc of sludge cake comply the requirement of the advanced dewatering 60 consequently the advanced piezo dewatering of sludge assisted with pam was further investigated below fig 5b presented mcs of sludge cake for the various dosage of t bt in the presence of 0 005 g pam it could be seen from the figure that the mc decreased rapidly at the first and then changed slightly as the dosage increased its breakpoint corresponded to 0 45 g t bt and 54 9 mc the rapid reduction of mc could be simply attributed to increase of the piezoelectric active sites as amount of t bt increased the little change denoted that the efficiency of piezo dewatering was possibly dependent on the type of these removed waters in addition to the dosage of piezo materials because it was well known that bound water was difficult to remove vesilind et al 1994 fig 5c showed the dependence of dewatering efficiency with the time of pressure filtration for the optimal dosage of conditioners mc of sludge cake decreased rapidly at first then decreased slowly and only changed slightly after about 120 min showing a three phase variation characteristic the features might also depend on the type of squeezed out water according to shi and zhou et als investigations shi et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 the first stage was dependent on removal of free waters because they were less influenced by its solid matrix and easily removed and squeezed out the second stage involved the removal of partial bound waters the final stage was related to the slow removal of residual bound water tight to sludge such as vicinal water intracellular water and hydration water the reduction of sludge weight in the first stage of piezo dewatering processes with t bt and t bt pam were 82 3 and 86 2 weight of raw sludge individually as shown in the inset of fig 5c they both obviously exceeded the content of free water in raw sludge 72 1 this result showed that in the first stage some of the bound water were also removed in addition to free water the difference among this result and zhou and shi et als investigations might originate from the piezoelectric effect of t bt fig 5d presented the dependences of dewatering efficiency on the set final pressure of pressure filtration with t bt or c bt and pam as expected dewatering performance of sludge was intensively dependent on the pressure of pressure filtration mc of the sludge cake from pressure filtration with t bt rapidly decreased at first and then slowly changed after 0 6 mpa displaying a nonlinear curve although mc of the sludge cake from pressure filtration with c bt also presented a nonlinear curve as pressure increased the shape of two curves was considerably different in the range of pressure 0 1 mpa they basically overlapped after 0 1 mpa their difference rapidly increased and finally reached to 17 1 the inset of fig 5d because c bt possessed no piezo active and t bt possessed strong piezo active the overlapping of two curves under 0 1 mpa denoted that the dewatering under low pressure was mainly for the mechanically squeezing effect of pressure not for piezoelectric effect the significant difference of two curves after 0 1 mpa was reasonably attributed to the piezoelectric effect of t bt it was also noticed that the increase of difference was proportional to the applied pressure but not linear inset of fig 5d the change of increase was not completely consistent with the linear relationship between piezoelectric potential and pressure as shown in the below formula feng et al 2017 wu et al 2016 3 v p τ y d xy w x ε rx ε 0 where vp is the piezo potential τy is the applied stress in y direction dxy is the piezoelectric coefficient wx is the length of the all add upped cell unit in the x direction εrx is the relative permittivity in x direction and ε0 represented the permittivity of free space this inconsistence might depend on the changes in type of the removed water with extent of deepening dewatering as mentioned above the advanced dewatering involved a variety of bound water that was more difficult to extrude than free water 3 4 possible mechanism of t bt piezo dewatering disintegration of sludge by piezoelectric effect the sludge is an aggregate of biomass inorganics and water with complex networks it is crucial to disintegrate these aggregates for deep dewatering of sludge although there are still some disagreements about what is the most appropriate dd value of sludge for the perspective of filterability wang et al 2006a wang et al 2006b wu et al 2020 fig 6 a presented the changes of sludge dd in the three conditioning pressure filtration processes the dd values increased faster as time of pressure filtration increased and finally reached 32 6 for t bt added sludge it was slightly less than that of fenton oxidation but much higher than that of free fluctuant pam and coagulant fecl3 conditioned sludge also higher than many reported dd values of aops conditioned sludge erkan et al 2019 2020 li et al 2021 lippert et al 2020 because dd is often used as an indicator of the dewaterability of conditioned sludge it was reasonably believed that the significantly enhanced dewatering effect of t bt was dependent on its strong disintegrating ability to sludge it was still observed from fig 6a that the dd of c bt added sludge was no apparent change comparing with that of unconditioned sludge this fact suggested that the enhancement of sludge disintegration was originated from the piezoelectric effect of t bt the suggestion was further supported by the increase of tp and toc in filtrate of t bt conditioned sludge comparing with that of the free conditioner sludge fig 6c and 6d although it is difficult to accurately determine the composition and structure of each substance in these filtrates the types of main substance could be characterized by 3d eem fluorescence spectra of these filtrates yang et al 2020 as shown in fig 7 three eem fluorescence peaks were observed both for filtrates of the free and t bt conditioning pressure filtration the peak 1 λex λem 225 nm 345 nm could be assigned to the aromatic protein like substances peak 2 λex λem 225 nm 470 nm was related to the fulvic acid like materials and peak 3 λex λem 350 nm 435 nm was from the humic acid like substances yang et al 2020 although the peaks of two eem fluorescence spectra both located in similar regions their peak intensities of fig 7b were much higher than that of fig 7a in other words the leakage of fulvic acid like and humic acid like especially aromatic protein like substances increased with t bt conditioning obviously the leakage was caused by the piezoelectric effect of t bt the increase of fluorescence substance was possibly from the disintegrated eps and also possibly from inside of the damaged cells in order to clarify the origins the filtrate samples were determined as an indicator of oxidation of cell membrane fan et al 2020 feng et al 2020 graf et al 2019 fig 6b displayed the change of mda concentration in the three dewatering processes conditioner free c bt and t bt added pressure filtrations the concentration of mda only slightly increased with time in the first two pressure filtration processes while addition of t bt resulted in a rapid increase of mda which reached a peak value of 3 82 mmol l at 60 min and then slowly decreased this significant increase of mda implied that the cell membranes of sludge were seriously damaged and the decrease was possibly due to the further oxidation decomposition of mda in the process of t bt added pressure filtration was similar to sökmen et als observation sökmen et al 2001 the damage of cell membranes was further intuitively confirmed by the change of sem images of sludge cells in the process of pressure filtration as indicated in fig s1 an intact cell before treatment was like a rod shape with a smooth surface after piezo conditioning and pressure filtration for 120 min they were changed into fragments with a rougher surface and potholes indicating that the cell membrane ruptures generally the disruption of microbial cells was more difficult in the usual conditionings due to the protect role of eps outside the cell thus the apparent damage of cell membranes denoted that the piezoelectric effect of t bt could deeply disintegrated sludge even eps and cell structures because these fluorescence substances in the filtrate originated mainly from both eps and cells the disintegration could improve the sludge dewaterability because the release of intracellular and floc block substances has been well proven to be beneficial to conversion of bound water to free water in sludge he et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 in addition it s worth mentioning that cod in the sewage of south china was generally lower if the filtrate containing these substances were flowed back to the sewage its carbon source would increase which would have a positive impact on denitrification in sewage treatment pathways of piezo conditioning generally the oxidation of sludge was related to the occurrence of ros in its conditioning process ge et al 2019a ge et al 2019b ge et al 2020 lin et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 therefore several typical ros in the filtrates from the three pressure filtration processes were detected in order to understand the mechanism of t bt piezo conditioning and sludge piezo dewatering fig 8 a presented a well defined 4 fold esr peak with an intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 for t bt piezo conditioning pressure filtration process which was consistent with the esr characteristics of oh while no apparent esr response was observed for free conditioning and c bt conditioning pressure filtration processes a similar situation was also witnessed in the esr spectra of o2 and 1o2 fig 8b and 8c additionally another ros h2o2 was quantitatively determined as shown in fig 8d the concentration of h2o2 strikingly increased with time of pressure filtration and reached 91 2 μmol l at 120 min for t bt conditioning pressure filtration process but no significant h2o2 was detected for free piezo material and c bt conditioning pressure filtration processes these observations confirmed that the pressure of pressure filtration could drive nano piezo material t bt to catalytically generate various ros this was the first example about the piezocatalysis switched directly by pressure of pressure filtration although the sonication excited piezocatalysis was frequently reported hong et al 2010 wang et al 2021a wang et al 2021b zhu et al 2020 as mentioned above the increase of fulvic acid like humic acid like and aromatic protein like especially mda was dependent on oxidation disintegration of these ros for sludge jyoti and pandit 2003 nguyen et al 2013 in order to estimate the contribution magnitudes of above various ros to the sludge disintegration the experiments about activity depressing of these radicals were performed by adding corresponding radical scavengers han et al 2011 xiao et al 2016 yao et al 2014 as shown in fig 9 the addition of p bq or nan3 as a scavenger of o2 and 1o2 individually could only slightly depress dd of t bt added sludge and the depress ratio was ca 5 8 and 2 2 respectively for 10 mmol l p bq or nan3 while the addition of tba as oh scavenger could drastically decrease dd of t bt added sludge for example for 10 mmol l tba the dd of sludge decreased to 16 9 within 120 min which was only half of that of free t bt added sludge these experimental results manifested that the enhanced effect on sludge disintegration and dewatering of t bt was mainly due to oxidation of oh from t bt piezo catalytic process which was similar to the reported mechanisms of many other aops conditioning for sludge liang et al 2020 mo1 et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 additionally due to no suitable scavenger for h2o2 its contribution was not quantitatively determined it was reported to possess stronger inactivation role than that of ros for bacteria although oxidizability of h2o2 was much weaker than that of oh radical it was because h2o2 possessed a longer lifetime and could permeate inside cell while oh radical mainly oxidized their cell membrane xia et al 2015 hence it was reasonable to believe that h2o2 also took an important role in the sludge disintegration it was noticed that after subjected to piezo dewatering the zeta potential of sludge increased from 25 6 mv to 19 1 mv the increase value was less than that of the conditioned sludge by usual coagulation and or flocculation liang et al 2019 wang et al 2018 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 the small change of zeta potential was possibly dependent on the characteristics of piezo dewatering process the current researches about piezocatalysis were basically focused on intrinsic free carrier involved catalytic reactions however it has been recently found that the intrinsic free charge carriers in piezo materials were few and could not completely balance piezoelectric charges therefore there was a remnant piezoelectric field in the strained piezo material hao et al 2018 huang et al 2017 referring to the principle of chemical conditioning the positive and negative charges of remnant piezo field possibly electrically neutralized with charged sludge particles reducing their zeta potential and improving the dewaterability of the sludge but according to the piezoelectric theory the piezo field of t bt existed only under stress i e in extrusion of pressure filtration if the sludge cake was taken out of pressure filtration the piezoelectric effect of t bt disappeared and simultaneously the electric neutralization effect of its remnant piezo field also vanished consequently and the zeta potential of its sludge particles increased leading to the reduction of zeta potential difference between raw sludge and sludge cake in order to confirm this conditioning effect of the remnant piezo field t bt was coated with vitrified sio2 t bt sio2 to prevent the transfer of free carriers in t bt to external environment that is to depress piezocatalysis it could be seen from fig s2 that after t bt sio2 added sludge was subjected to pressure filtration for 60 min the mc of its sludge cake was 74 1 being 6 0 and 6 9 less than that of the sludge cake from c bt added and free conditioner sludge respectively this fact exhibited that a part of piezo conditioning role stemmed from the filed effect of the remnant piezoelectric filed of t bt in addition to its piezocatalysis although it was difficult to completely clarify the conditioning mechanism of remnant piezoelectric field at present at least the remnant piezoelectric field could be expected to generate electric neutralization effect with sludge particles according to the usual principle of electricity fig 10 combined with above experimental observations and analysis it could be concluded that the piezoelectric effect conditioned the sludge by two pathways the catalytic oxidation of piezo generating ros specially oh radicals and the electric effect of remnant piezo field in process of pressure filtration the piezo conditioning mechanism was schematically presented below 4 conclusions a new sludge dewatering process piezo dewatering was proposed and investigated it could be directly switched by the pressure of pressure filtration without any additional energy the mc and weight of sludge were reduced from 96 7 0 9 to 63 9 and from 50 g to 3 2 g respectively by piezo dewatering of 0 45 g t bt under 0 6 mpa for 2 h and the piezo dewatering process assisted with 0 005 g pam could further reduce mc to less than 60 which complied to the requirement of advanced dewatering the favorable piezo dewatering effect of t bt was confirmed by two conditioning pathways the catalytic oxidation of piezo generating ros and the electric effect of remnant piezo field these investigation results not only offered a new alternative for sludge advanced dewatering but also extended the application of electric piezoelectric effect and deepened the understanding of sludge dewatering mechanism however from the perspective of practical application the piezo dewatering technology was still in its infancy and many issues need further research such

16411,enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr is used extensively in full scale wastewater treatment plants for the removal of phosphorus despite previous evidence showing that glycine is a carbon source for a certain lineage of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos such as tetrasphaera it is still unknown whether glycine can support ebpr we observed an overall adverse effect of glycine on ebpr using activated sludge from both full scale wastewater treatment plants and lab scale reactors harboring distant and diverse paos and glycogen accumulating organisms gaos including candidatus accumulibacter thiothrix tetrasphaera dechloromonas ca competibacter and defluviicoccus among others glycine induced phosphorus p release under anaerobic conditions without being effectively taken up by cells the induced p release rate correlated with glycine concentration in the range of 10 to 50 mg c l paos continued to release p in the presence of glycine under aerobic conditions without any evident p uptake under mixed carbon conditions the occurrence of glycine did not seem to affect acetate uptake however it significantly reduced the rate of p uptake in the aerobic phase overall glycine did not appear to be an effective carbon source for a majority of paos and gaos in full scale and lab scale systems and neither did other community members utilize glycine under anaerobic or aerobic conditions metatranscriptomic analysis showed the transcription of glycine cleavage t p and h protein genes but not of the l protein or the downstream genes in the glycine cleavage pathway suggesting barriers to metabolizing glycine the high transcription of a gene encoding a drug metabolite transporter suggests a potential efflux mechanism where glycine transported into the cells is in turn exported at the expense of atp resulting in p release without affecting the glycine concentration in solution the ability of glycine to induce p release without cellular uptake suggests a way to

proteobacterial ca accumulibacter and actinobacterial tetrasphaera were shown to be key organisms in full scale ebpr systems their carbon source utilization and metabolism have been studied extensively hanada et al 2002 kong et al 2005 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 ca accumulibacter related paos mainly use vfas as their primary carbon sources chua et al 2006 while tetrasphaera shows more versatile substrate uptake characteristics glucose amino acids nguyen et al 2011 2015 marques et al 2017 and other complex organic matter may be effectively utilized via fermentation nielsen et al 2010 kristiansen et al 2013 marques et al 2017 using activated sludge from a full scale plant in aalborg nguyen et al 2015 showed that 11 amino acids induced p release anaerobically where glycine enabled the highest p release aside from acetate 3h labelled glycine was taken up mainly by tetrasphaera subsequent characterization using tetrasphaera elongate as a model pao showed that glycine was stored intracellularly as free glycine under anaerobic conditions it was oxidized under aerobic conditions for p uptake demonstrating that glycine is an effective carbon source for tetrasphaera nguyen et al 2015 in a lab scale enrichment reactor marques et al 2017 obtained a mixed pao community composed of tetrasphaera and ca accumulibacter microautoradiography fluorescence in situ hybridization mar fish analysis confirmed that tetrasphaera was mainly responsible for glycine and other amino acids such as aspartate and glutamate uptake while ca accumulibacter likely survived on fermentation products of their tetrasphaera companies recently qiu et al 2020 showed that ca accumulibacter taxa like clade iif strain scelse 1 were also effective amino acid users among the 20 amino acids tested 11 including glycine induced detectable p release aspartate and glutamate showed the highest efficiency in supporting p cycling suggesting a role for amino acids in supporting ca accumulibacter meditated ebpr qiu et al 2020 in a metatranscriptomic analysis of a lab scale enrichment culture of ca accumulibacter clade iia strain uw 1 the transcription of a glycine cleavage operon was also identified batch tests further confirmed that glycine addition stimulated p release glycine was thus considered a viable carbon source for ca accumulibacter oyserman et al 2016 however based on mar fish analysis kong et al 2004 reported that paomix fish probe targeting most ca accumulibacter defined paos in full scale sludge in denmark did not assimilate glycine by a combined analysis of the p release and carbon uptake profiles when glycine was used as a carbon source qiu et al 2020 showed that glycine induced p release but with very faint carbon uptake resulting in a p release c uptake ratio of 1 46 mol p mol c this implies that the p release caused by glycine addition was probably not well coupled with its uptake in addition marques et al 2017 also showed that p release of a mixed enrichment culture of ca accumulibacter and tetrasphaera was not directly linked to glycine uptake p release occurred after the carbon was fully consumed collectively contradictory results together with anomalous and unexplained behaviors were observed when glycine was used as a carbon source the highly deviating p release c uptake ratio qiu et al 2020 observed for glycine induced p release of ca accumulibacter challenged the common perception of the p release c uptake mechanisms of paos however no detailed study has been performed to date to validate the effectiveness of glycine as a carbon source for ebpr in a more comprehensive and general sense according to nielsen et al 2010 municipal wastewater contains 25 35 of proteins as cod thus a high occurrence of amino acids in municipal wastewaters is expected they can be up to hundreds of mg l in primary sludge miron et al 2000 and even higher in digestates of sludge digestors higgins et al 2008 glycine concentrations in municipal wastewaters are in the range of 0 02 to 1 70 mg l burleson et al 1980 huang et al 2010 recycling of liquids within wwtps is a common practice and plants may also receive wastewaters from food processing or related industries hence there are a variety of possible sources of high concentrations of glycine in wwtps since glycine was previously reported as a viable or potentially viable carbon source for some paos e g tetrasphaera and ca accumulibacter nguyen et al 2015 oyserman et al 2016 it is of interest to confirm its validity as a carbon source for ebpr activated sludge samples were collected from full scale wwtps and a lab scale sequencing batch reactor sbr and p release and uptake rates with glycine as sole carbon source or in a mixture with acetate were determined to probe its role in ebpr systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 activated sludge 2 1 1 sequencing batch reactor a lab scale sbr with a working volume of 5 l was inoculated with activated sludge collected from a local wwtp the sbr was operated with 6 h cycles including a slow feeding stage 60 min an anaerobic stage 20 min an aerobic stage 180 min and a settling decant stage 100 min acetate was used as a sole carbon source the sbr was operated at an hrt and srt of 12 h and 15 d respectively the ph was controlled at 6 90 7 50 and do levels were maintained at 0 8 1 5 mg l during the aerobic phase the temperature was controlled at 25 c more details of the operational parameters and the composition of the feed wastewater are provided in the supplementary material the long term ebpr activities are presented in fig s1 activated sludge used for batch tests in this study was collected on days 60 85 when thiothrix was the dominant pao fig s2a and fig s3a and days 330 360 with ca accumulibacter as the dominant pao fig s3b where high and stable ebpr removal was achieved 2 1 2 activated sludge samples from full scale wwtps activated sludge samples were collected from three full scale wwtps in

oxic membrane bioreactor the ebpr activities and p removal in the wwtps are shown in table s1 fresh mixed liquor was collected at the end of the aerobic zone of each wwtp for anaerobic aerobic cycle studies all the activated sludge samples were stored at 4 c and tested within 24 h 2 2 glycine as a carbon source for ebpr to investigate the validity of glycine as a carbon source for ebpr an anaerobic p release c uptake test was performed on activated sludge from the lab scale reactor a concentration range of 10 100 mg c l was examined based on the typical range tested in previous studies nguyen et al 2015 marques et al 2017 qiu et al 2019 rey martinez et al 2019 2020 and in wastewater treatment systems activated sludge thiothrix predominated as a pao fig s2a was collected at the end of the aerobic stage and diluted to 1 0 g mixed liquor suspended solids mlss l different mlss concentrations were used in different experiments based on availability of the sample activated sludge using po4 3 p no3 n and no2 n free aerobic effluent from the same reactor two hundred milliliter diluted activated sludge was added to each reactor and purged with nitrogen gas for 15 min to achieve anaerobic conditions glycine was added to respective reactors at different final concentrations 10 25 and 50 mg c l to start the anaerobic p release c uptake test one reactor with no glycine addition served as a control where the same activated sludge was used as in the experimental groups the same applies to all subsequent experiments during the test the temperature was maintained at 30 1 c in a water bath the ph was maintained at 7 25 7 50 using 0 5 m hcl and 0 5 m naoh nitrogen gas was purged continuously to provide an anaerobic condition filtered water samples through 0 45 μm membrane filters were collected at a certain time interval for po4 3 p total nitrogen tn and total organic carbon toc analysis to further confirm the effect of glycine ca accumulibacter pao enriched activated sludge mlss 3 8 g l relative abundance of 45 6 fig s3b from the lab scale sbr on day 360 was further tested glycine or acetate at 100 mg c l was used as a carbon source a group without carbon source addition served as control the batch test consisted of a 90 min anaerobic phase and a 150 min aerobic phase filtered water samples through 0 45 μm membrane filters were collected for po4 3 p and toc analysis activated sludge samples were collected just before the experiment started 0 min at 10 min anaerobic phase and at 120 min aerobic phase from each group snap frozen in liquid n2 and stored at 80 c for metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis to test gene transcription when glycine was used as a carbon source 2 3 effects of glycine on anaerobic uptake of acetate in applications the co presence of diverse carbon sources is expected to investigate the uptake of acetate in the presence of glycine an experiment was performed in parallel reactors 200 ml as detailed in section 2 2 where activated sludge thiothrix pao predominated fig s2a and fig s3a was collected from the sbr at the end of the aerobic stage and diluted to 2 0 g mlss l using the aerobic effluent of the same reactor the carbon source consisted of 20 mg c l acetate 50 mg c l glycine or a mixture of 20 mg c l acetate and 50 mg c l glycine the p release and c uptake profiles were monitored for 2 h under anaerobic conditions filtered water samples through 0 45 μm membrane filters were collected at a certain time interval for po4 3 p and toc analysis additional experiment was performed using ca accumulibacter enriched activated sludge mlss 3 8 g l the relative abundance of ca accumulibacter was 45 6 as suggested by metagenomic analysis fig s3b following the same procedure but using 50 mg c l acetate 50 mg c l glycine or a mixture of 50 mg c l acetate and 50 mg c l glycine as a carbon source the experiment was done in triplicates 2 4 effects of glycine on aerobic p uptake to further understand the effects of glycine on aerobic p uptake experiments were performed using activated sludge dominated by thiothrix pao fig s2a and fig s3a from the lab scale sbr at the end of the anaerobic stage three hundred milliliters of mixed liquor mlss 4 5 g l were collected from the reactor and equally distributed into 50 ml reactors glycine was added at a final concentration of 0 10 and 50 mg c l air was purged into the reactors to achieve aerobic conditions and p uptake was monitored for 140 min the experiment was done in duplicate filtered water through 0 45 μm membrane filters was collected at certain time intervals for po4 3 p analysis 2 5 persistence of the effects of glycine under aerobic conditions to further understand the persistence of the effects of glycine on aerobic p uptake an experiment was performed by firstly exposing the activated sludge to glycine and then removing it i e glycine followed by an aerobic p uptake test activated sludge collected from the sbr at the end of the anaerobic stage was anaerobically incubated with 100 mg c l glycine for 1 h then the incubated sludge was centrifuged and washed with the reactor supernatant collected at the end of the anaerobic stage to remove any remaining glycine the washed sludge was then subjected to aerobic conditions the p uptake activities were monitored during 2 h activated sludge with no anaerobic glycine incubation served as a control the experiment was done in duplicate 2 6 effects of glycine on p release and uptake activities of activated sludge from full scale wwtps to test the universality of the effects of glycine experiments were performed on five activated sludge samples collected from three full scale wwtps fresh activated sludge was collected from the wwtps at the end of the aerobic zones and then diluted with secondary effluent no2 and no3 free from the corresponding wwtps to a final mlss concentration of 2 0 g l volumes of 1000 ml of mixed liquor were added to three parallel reactors the reactors were initially purged with nitrogen gas for 15 min to achieve anaerobic conditions acetate or glycine was added as a sole carbon source to a final concentration of 30 mg c l to respective reactors a reactor with no carbon source addition served as control the ph was maintained at 7 25 using 0 5 m hcl and 0 5 m naoh the process included a 3 h anaerobic phase and a 3 h aerobic phase filtered water through 0 45 μm membrane filters was collected at certain time intervals for po4 3 p and toc analysis sludge samples were collected and fixed with 2 drops of 40 formaldehyde washed and freeze dried for polyhydroxyalkanoate pha and glycogen analysis additionally experiments were further performed with a mixture of glycine and acetate at different carbon molar ratios of 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 9 0 2 0 8 0 5 0 5 and 0 0 1 0 for activated sludge from wwtp and 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 8 0 5 0 5 and 0 0 1 0 for activated sludge from wwtp2 to investigate the ebpr performance in all cases the final toc concentration was 50 mg l 2 7 analytical methods the mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss nh4 n no3 n po4 3 p and tn were measured following standard methods apha 1999 toc was analyzed

into the ncbi database under bioproject no prjna743190 2 9 metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses were performed on the ca accumulibacter enriched activated sludge samples collected during the full cycle study section 2 2 to elucidate the mechanism of the observed adverse effects of glycine detailed sequencing and data analysis procedures are provided in the supplementary material the obtained data were deposited into the ncbi database under bioproject no prjna771771 3 results and discussion 3 1 glycine as a carbon source for ebpr when glycine was used as a carbon source significantly deviated p release c uptake ratios were observed qiu et al 2020 which is inconsistent with typical pao metabolic models to validate the effectiveness of glycine as a carbon source for ebpr batch tests were performed using activated sludge from a lab scale sbr by adding glycine at different concentrations 10 25 and 50 mg c l respectively significant p release was observed up to 10 3 mg l when glycine was used as a carbon source fig 1 a the extent of p release showed high dependency on the amount of glycine added fig 1a with the p release rate being linearly related to the glycine concentration r2 0 999 p 0 000 in contrast the toc and tn fig 1b levels remained largely unchanged over the entire anaerobic phase suggesting that glycine was not taken up by the microbial community glycine may be fermented to acetate via the glycine serine pyruvate interconversion pathway klein and sagers 1962 hartwich et al 2012 as suggested by nguyen et al 2015 tetrasphaera elongata is able to take up glycine and ferment it to acetate release of acetate was observed under anaerobic conditions accounting for 20 of 13c labeled glycine taken up by the bacteria in their study however the probability of glycine cleavage was low in our system because once glycine had been deaminated to acetate it would have been readily taken up by paos or gaos in view of the unchanged toc and tn profiles and the simple molecular structure of glycine its conversion to other compounds was also unlikely 16s rrna gene amplicon analysis sbr1 in fig s2 suggested that the dominant paos in the sludge were thiothrix relative abundance of 32 4 dechloromonas 4 55 and a small proportion of ca accumulibacter 0 01 together with significant amounts of gaos 19 6 ca competibacter and 0 64 ca contendobacter thiothrix caldifontis has been reported as a pao with a mixotrophic metabolism for p removal rubio rincónet et al 2017 using glutamate as a sole carbon source rey martinez et al 2019 obtained an enrichment culture dominated by thiothrix 37 together with a small amount of ca accumulibacter 7 7 the role of thiothrix as a pao was further confirmed dechloromonas may exhibit both pao and gao phenotypes kong et al 2007 ahn et al 2007 terashima et al 2016 petriglieri et al 2021 and its role in the present study is not clear in view of the high relative abundance of thiothrix which was further confirmed by metagenomic analysis fig s3a it is considered the key pao in our enrichment culture a batch test was also performed with a ca accumulibacter with a relative abundance value of 45 6 as suggested by metagenomic analysis fig s3b enrichment culture similar results were obtained where p was released in the absence of significant glycine uptake confirming that the effect of glycine also applied to ca accumulibacter pao fig s4 collectively these results suggest that neither of these paos or gaos could use glycine as an effective carbon source on the contrary the presence of glycine may have induced a mechanism discussed below resulting in p release by paos without meaningful glycine uptake 3 2 effects of glycine on acetate uptake acetate is a key carbon source for ebpr and is commonly present in municipal wastewater to investigate if glycine could potentially interfere with acetate uptake a batch test was performed with a mixture of 20 mg c l acetate and 50 mg c l glycine as carbon sources using activated sludge from the lab scale sbr sbr1 in fig s2 the presence of glycine did not seem to affect the uptake of acetate since the acetate uptake fig 2 a and p release rates induced by acetate with or without glycine were largely unchanged fig 2b similar results were obtained using activated sludge enriched in ca accumulibacter with a relative abundance value of 45 6 fig s3b fig s5 previous research suggested that acetate uptake by paos ca accumulibacter was mainly achieved via an acetate proton symporter actp driven by the proton motive force pmf garcía martin et al 2006 saunders et al 2007 skennerton et al 2015 oyserman et al 2016 the unaffected acetate uptake in the presence of glycine suggested that glycine did not interfere this pmf related mechanism fig 2a when acetate and glycine were both present the p release rate was slightly higher 10 0 mg p g mlss h than was observed for acetate alone 9 2 mg p g mlss h but was much lower than the sum of the glycine and acetate induced p release rate 14 1 mg p g mlss h when both carbon sources were supplied separately fig 2b showing that the presence of acetate could significantly alleviate the unexpected p release induced by glycine however this result also implies that in a complex carbon context the adverse effects of glycine may be cloaked by the presence of acetate or other carbon sources 3 3 effects of glycine on aerobic p uptake uptake of glycine in the anaerobic phase was not significant fig 1 which would inevitably result in its carry over into the aerobic phase to further understand the effects of glycine on aerobic p uptake an experiment was performed with the activated sludge from the lab scale sbr comprising of thiothrix tetrasphaera dechloromonas at relative abundance values of 9 14 0 58 and 0 23 respectively and ca competibacter and defluviicoccus at relative abundance values of 11 8 and 3 00 sbr2 in fig s2a p release was monitored in the sbr with acetate at a final concentration of 100 mg c l as a sole carbon source fig 3 glycine was added to different concentrations at the beginning of the aerobic phase the presence of glycine in the aerobic phase resulted in a significant reduction in p uptake fig 3 at glycine concentrations of 10 and 50 mg c l the p uptake rates were 72 5 and 59 8 of the control respectively there was a clear negative correlation between p uptake rate and the concentration of glycine showing that the adverse effects of glycine on aerobic p uptake are concentration dependent as well an additional experiment was conducted to investigate the persistence of the adverse effect of glycine on p uptake fig 4 in the anaerobic phase with acetate as sole carbon source 102 7 mg p l was released at a rate of 15 1 mg p g mlss h fig 4 in the following glycine incubation period glycine continued to induce p release at a substantially lower rate 2 3 mg p g mlss h glycine was subsequently removed by centrifugation and washing before the sludge was subjected to aerobic conditions there was no significant difference p value 0 127 between the control group no glycine incubation and the group exposed to glycine suggesting that the effect of glycine on aerobic p uptake did not persist the unchanged p uptake profiles also suggested that a one hour anaerobic exposure to glycine with substantial p release did not have a significant impact on the cell viability of paos however since glycine was not readily removable by other community members the long term occurrence of glycine even at low concentrations and its subsequent impact on paos and other bacteria warrants attention 3 4 effects of glycine on activated sludge from full scale plants to understand the universality of the observed effects of glycine experiments were done on activated sludge from full scale plants with glycine or acetate as carbon sources for comparison in the system with acetate as a carbon source acetate uptake occurred along with p release resulting in p release c uptake ratios of 0 32 0 59 mol p mol c complete acetate uptake was observed at the end the 3 h anaerobic phase with initial carbon uptake rates of 9 59 11 20 mg c g mlss h fig 5 and fig s6 in comparison glycine induced p release of 7 45 8 18 mg p g mlss however only as little as 2 71 of glycine was taken up anaerobically again showing that glycine was not effectively assimilated under these conditions a large portion of glycine remained unutilized and was carried over into the aerobic phase even in the aerobic phase glycine was consumed at extremely low rates 1 36 1 69 mg c g mlss h pha analyses fig s7 showed significant pha formation 10 3 14 6 mg pha g mlss when acetate was used as a carbon source with the acetate uptake to pha formation rates of 0 88 1 07 mol c mol c on the other hand little pha was formed with glycine suggesting that glycine was neither directly used by paos or gaos nor was it converted into acetate or other vfas the results observed for activated sludge from full scale wwtps were in line with those obtained with lab scale sludge suggesting that it is a commonly occurring phenomenon that glycine used as a carbon source induces p release without concurring glycine uptake in the activated sludge from these wwtps a variety of sequences related to paos and gaos were indentified via 16 s rrna gene amplicon sequencing fig s2b ca accumulibacter relative abundence values of 1 40 3 55 followed by tetrasphaera 0 28 1 47 and ca obscuribacter 0 06 1 20 represented known paos ca competibacter 0 87 4 35 dominated the gao community followed by defluviicoccus 0 10 3 17 some tetrasphaera taxa t elongata strain lp2 have been reported as effective glycine users in our study tetrasphaera was detected in all full scale sludge samples relative abundence values up to 1 47 through a regression analysis a strong postive correlation r2 0 819 p 0 008 was observed between the relative abundance of tetrasphaera and the glycine uptake rate fig s8 implying that these tetrasphaera taxa were probably utilizing glycine the p release c uptake ratio for tetrasphaera elongata was reported as 0 48 mol p mol c when glycine was used as a carbon source nguyen et al 2015 while the p c ratios obtained in this study was 0 87 5 20 mol p mol c implying that other pao members besides tetrasphaera in the activated sludge contributed to the majority of p release without glycine uptake in the aerobic phase p release continued instead of any p uptake in all cases further glycine remained largely unutilized after 3 h suggesting that most paos and gaos and other bacteria as well present in the activated sludge could not use glycine even under aerobic conditions again highlighting the noteworthy effects of glycine on ebpr despite the distinct ebpr community compositions all samples showed similar p release characteristics with glycine suggesting that the adverse effect of glycine is a common phenomenon to further validate the effect of glycine on aerobic p uptake by a complex microbial community potential ebpr activities of full scale activated sludge with a community composition as represented in fig s2b as wwtp1 and wwtp2 were evaluated with mixtures of acetate and glycine at different acetate glycine carbon molar ratios as carbon sources fig 6 and fig s9 in general the p release and uptake profiles are in line with those observed using lab scale sludge fig 3 systems with higher proportions of acetate experienced more p release the p release process may be divided into two phases in the first phase acetate uptake was associated with very high p release rates 12 0 27 9 mg p g mlss h in the second phase when acetate was fully consumed the remaining glycine induced continuous p release at lower rates 0 15 2 9 mg p g mlss h despite the different glycine acetate ratios the initial p release rate was largely the same which further confirmed that glycine does not significantly affect acetate uptake fig 3 in the aerobic phase p uptake efficiency was strongly negatively correlated r2 0 999 p value 0 001 with glycine concentration fig 6 and fig s9 at glycine acetate ratios of 0 1 0 9 0 2 0 8 and 0 5 0 5 64 6 55 5 and 8 0 of p released during the anaerobic phase were successfully taken up respectively in contrast to 88 0 when no glycine was present the corresponding p uptake rates were 2 47 0 1 0 9 1 90 0 2 0 8 and 0 34 0 5 0 5 mg p g mlss h compared to 4 30 mg p g mlss h when no glycine was added the presence of glycine at 5 mg c l could reduce the overall p removal efficiency by 23 and the p uptake rate by 42 when glycine was used as sole carbon source continuous p release was observed in the aerobic phase 0 42 mg p g mlss h p release has been reported in the aerobic phase in the presence of acetate as paos seem to prefer to hydrolyze poly p to obtain energy for acetate uptake even in the presence of oxygen serafim et al 2004 pijuan et al 2005 cokro et al 2017 assuming the reduced aerobic p uptake rate was a result of the glycine induced p release under aerobic conditions the rate of p uptake for systems with a mixture of glycine and acetate should be above 2 29 mg p g mlss h however the observed p uptake rates were much lower than that value fig 6 suggesting than p release in the aerobic phase caused by glycine explained only part of the reduction in the p uptake rate in summary the presence of glycine in the aerobic phase significantly reduced the p uptake rate despite the potential adverse effects of glycine on ebpr which needs attention this unique property of glycine may be utilizable ebpr results in a buildup of p in the activated sludge facilitating down stream p recovery p may be readily recovered from the sludge digestion supernatant or the ashes of sludge incineration desmidt et al 2015 however if the waste sludge is to be sent to a landfill or used as construction material meda et al 2021 pertinent ways to induce p release effectively and sustainably from the waste sludge are necessary for p recovery the ability of glycine to induce p release without being taken up by the cell points to a novel method for p extraction and recovery from the ebpr sludge high and continuous p release could be obtained at the expense of a very small amount of glycine the rate of p release may also be adjustable by altering the concentration of glycine making it a pertinent and environmental friendly approach for p extraction from ebpr sludge thus facilitating downstream p recovery simoes et al 2020 additionally the inability of a wide range of paos and gaos to use glycine highlights a promising way for community regulation and or enrichment of specific lineages of paos e g tetrasphaera elongata related taxa nguyen et al 2015 3 5 possible mechanisms of the adverse effects of glycine on paos using activated sludge from lab scale sbr reactor and full scale wwtps table 1 this study demonstrated an overall adverse effect of glycine on paos and ebpr acetate uptake which is driven by the pmf garcía martin et al 2006 skennerton et al 2015 oyserman et al 2016 was not affected by the presence of glycine fig 2 suggesting that glycine was not interrupting the transmembrane pmf otherwise either acetate uptake or acetate induced p release would be affected burow et al 2008 saunders et al 2007 additionally the persistence experiment fig 4 showed that glycine did not affect the viability of paos during short term exposure 60 min its impact on p uptake disappeared once it was removed from the system although amino acids are essential nutrients for bacteria their high intracellular concentrations cause feedback inhibitions and cytotoxicity eggeling and sahm 2003 jones et al 2015 it seems that the observed p release was probably related to mechanisms involving lowering glycine concentrations in cells preventing its accumulation in the cytoplasm indeed there is a commonly occurring defense mechanism in the form of efflux pumps which allow bacteria to extrude toxic or unfavorable substrates it is possible that paos used them to export the unfavorable glycine against a concentration gradient which consumed atp and resulted in p release fig 7 active efflux pumps were identified or predicted to reduce intracellular amino acids and thereby alleviate toxicity for bacteria jones et al 2015 overexpression of the yded gene in e coli encoding a membrane protein belonging to the drug metabolite transporter dmt superfamily resulted in the export of intercellularly accumulated l cysteine indicating that e coli mitigates l cysteine toxicity by employing efflux pumps dassler et al 2000 similar genes were also found in the cases of alanine hori et al 2011a b isoleucine valine leucine methionine kennerknecht et al 2002 and threonine aleshin et al 1999 another strong piece of evidence to support the efflux pump hypothesis is that the anaerobic p release rate was dependent on the glycine concentration fig 1a regression analysis showed a strong linear correlation r2 0 999 p value 0 000 between p release rate and glycine concentration at higher extracellular glycine concentrations increased influx of glycine into bacterial cells along the concentration gradient is expected to maintain a low intracellular glycine concentration increased energy is needed for active transport of glycine against the concentration gradient resulting in increased poly p hydrolysis and p release in our study a glycine acetate mixture induced a slightly higher p release rate 10 0 mg p g mlss h than acetate alone 9 2 mg p g mlss h but was far below the sum of the individual rates when only acetate or glycine were provided 14 1 mg p g mlss h fig 2 the presence of acetate resulted in a small amount 5 01 mg c l within 2 h of glycine uptake under anaerobic conditions fig 2a a possible reason is that glycine serves as a nitrogen source rather than a carbon source in this case hartung and ratcliffe 2002 kong et al 2004 glycine can be used by bacteria as a nitrogen source e g escherichia coli k12 and other newman et al 1976 sinclair and dawes 1995 a similar phenomenon was also reported by kong et al 2004 where amino acids leucine and thymidine could not be taken up as sole substrates by rhodocyclus related paos but were assimilated if acetate was also present as indicated by microautoradiography mar analysis pao metabolism by ca accumulibacter clade iia strain uw 1 significantly increased during anaerobic acetate contact as suggested by increased gene transcription oyserman et al 2016 with increased metabolic activities the cellular demand for glycine serving as nitrogen source or substrate for the synthesis of proteins would also increase hartung and ratcliffe 2002 kong et al 2004 in this case less efflux of glycine is expected fig 7 resulting in a significantly lower p release in the acetate glycine mixture system compared to the sum of individual acetate and glycine rates at the same concentrations in tests using only one carbon source fig 2b and fig s5 after glycine had been removed from the system fig 4 the unexpected p release in the aerobic phase stopped and p uptake returned to a normal level this observation also supports the efflux hypothesis to verify the efflux hypothesis metatranscriptomic analyses were performed on activated sludge samples collected during the glycine exposure batch experiment the corresponding physicochemical results are shown in fig s4 with an acetate receiving treatment group as a contrast and the no carbon source group as control the activated sludge used was from the ca accumulibacter enrichment culture fig s3b a gene encoding the permease of the drug metabolite transporter dmt superfamily was highly transcribed in the presence of glycine 178 3 times higher than the control group no expression of this gene in the acetate group fig 8 a supporting the efflux hypothesis additionally genes encoding the trap type c4 dicarboxylate transport system fig 8b together with a na h antiporter fig 8c were highly transcribed in the glycine treatment group a trap type c4 dicarboxylate transport system was also reported to be responsible for the uptake of amino acids driven by the sodium motive force smf wösten et al 2017 while the na h antiporter may have played a role in establishing an electrochemical potential of na across the cytoplasmic membrane i e the smf hiramatsu et al 1998 it is likely that glycine was transported into the cells via the trap type c4 dicarboxylate transport system fig 7 however the imported glycine was not metabolized as suggested by the low transcription of the genes encoding the glycine cleavage system proteins specifically although genes encoding the glycine cleavage system t p and h protein seemed to have been upregulated fig 8d f transcription of the downstream l protein fig 8g the glycine serine hydroxymethyltransferase fig 8h and the threonine dehydratase fig 8i genes were significantly lowered compared to those in the control and the acetate treatment group suggesting potential feedback inhibitions of glycine collectively glycine seems to have been taken up by paos via the trap type c4 dicarboxylate transport system at the expense of smf however it was not metabolized due to the inactivation of the downstream glycine cleavage system genes fig 8g i the accumulation of glycine in the cell induced the dmt efflux mechanism fig 7 as a result glycine was not consumed significantly in the liquid phase but the activation of the uptake and efflux systems consumed atp resulting in unexpected p release fig 7 4 conclusions this work reported for the first time the adverse effects of glycine on paos and ebpr systems glycine induced p release anaerobically without being taken up by cells implying that glycine is not a valid carbon source for most paos and gaos from lab scale and full scale systems the p release rate in anaerobic conditions and the reduction in the p uptake rate in aerobic conditions are linearly related to the concentration of glycine in activated sludge with diverse and distinct microbial communities suggesting an overall adverse effect of glycine on pao metabolism the co existence of glycine did not affect acetate uptake anaerobically but significantly lowered the p uptake in the aerobic phase implying the coexistence of multiple carbon sources in sewage may mask the adverse effect of glycine adding to difficulties in realizing and detecting the impacts of glycine on ebpr systems during short term exposure 1 h the adverse effect of glycine on p uptake is transient and disappears after removing glycine from the system however glycine is neither readily usable by diverse paos and gaos nor easily degradable by other microorganisms in both full scale wwtps and lab scale reactors under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions the presence or accidental introduction of glycine into the ebpr system could be highly detrimental and should be avoided apart from its potential threats to ebpr systems these unique properties of glycine make it a sustainable and low cost agent for p extraction and recovery from ebpr sludge supplementary material table s1 s3 fig s1 s9 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

16411,enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr is used extensively in full scale wastewater treatment plants for the removal of phosphorus despite previous evidence showing that glycine is a carbon source for a certain lineage of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos such as tetrasphaera it is still unknown whether glycine can support ebpr we observed an overall adverse effect of glycine on ebpr using activated sludge from both full scale wastewater treatment plants and lab scale reactors harboring distant and diverse paos and glycogen accumulating organisms gaos including candidatus accumulibacter thiothrix tetrasphaera dechloromonas ca competibacter and defluviicoccus among others glycine induced phosphorus p release under anaerobic conditions without being effectively taken up by cells the induced p release rate correlated with glycine concentration in the range of 10 to 50 mg c l paos continued to release p in the presence of glycine under aerobic conditions without any evident p uptake under mixed carbon conditions the occurrence of glycine did not seem to affect acetate uptake however it significantly reduced the rate of p uptake in the aerobic phase overall glycine did not appear to be an effective carbon source for a majority of paos and gaos in full scale and lab scale systems and neither did other community members utilize glycine under anaerobic or aerobic conditions metatranscriptomic analysis showed the transcription of glycine cleavage t p and h protein genes but not of the l protein or the downstream genes in the glycine cleavage pathway suggesting barriers to metabolizing glycine the high transcription of a gene encoding a drug metabolite transporter suggests a potential efflux mechanism where glycine transported into the cells is in turn exported at the expense of atp resulting in p release without affecting the glycine concentration in solution the ability of glycine to induce p release without cellular uptake suggests a way to

proteobacterial ca accumulibacter and actinobacterial tetrasphaera were shown to be key organisms in full scale ebpr systems their carbon source utilization and metabolism have been studied extensively hanada et al 2002 kong et al 2005 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 ca accumulibacter related paos mainly use vfas as their primary carbon sources chua et al 2006 while tetrasphaera shows more versatile substrate uptake characteristics glucose amino acids nguyen et al 2011 2015 marques et al 2017 and other complex organic matter may be effectively utilized via fermentation nielsen et al 2010 kristiansen et al 2013 marques et al 2017 using activated sludge from a full scale plant in aalborg nguyen et al 2015 showed that 11 amino acids induced p release anaerobically where glycine enabled the highest p release aside from acetate 3h labelled glycine was taken up mainly by tetrasphaera subsequent characterization using tetrasphaera elongate as a model pao showed that glycine was stored intracellularly as free glycine under anaerobic conditions it was oxidized under aerobic conditions for p uptake demonstrating that glycine is an effective carbon source for tetrasphaera nguyen et al 2015 in a lab scale enrichment reactor marques et al 2017 obtained a mixed pao community composed of tetrasphaera and ca accumulibacter microautoradiography fluorescence in situ hybridization mar fish analysis confirmed that tetrasphaera was mainly responsible for glycine and other amino acids such as aspartate and glutamate uptake while ca accumulibacter likely survived on fermentation products of their tetrasphaera companies recently qiu et al 2020 showed that ca accumulibacter taxa like clade iif strain scelse 1 were also effective amino acid users among the 20 amino acids tested 11 including glycine induced detectable p release aspartate and glutamate showed the highest efficiency in supporting p cycling suggesting a role for amino acids in supporting ca accumulibacter meditated ebpr qiu et al 2020 in a metatranscriptomic analysis of a lab scale enrichment culture of ca accumulibacter clade iia strain uw 1 the transcription of a glycine cleavage operon was also identified batch tests further confirmed that glycine addition stimulated p release glycine was thus considered a viable carbon source for ca accumulibacter oyserman et al 2016 however based on mar fish analysis kong et al 2004 reported that paomix fish probe targeting most ca accumulibacter defined paos in full scale sludge in denmark did not assimilate glycine by a combined analysis of the p release and carbon uptake profiles when glycine was used as a carbon source qiu et al 2020 showed that glycine induced p release but with very faint carbon uptake resulting in a p release c uptake ratio of 1 46 mol p mol c this implies that the p release caused by glycine addition was probably not well coupled with its uptake in addition marques et al 2017 also showed that p release of a mixed enrichment culture of ca accumulibacter and tetrasphaera was not directly linked to glycine uptake p release occurred after the carbon was fully consumed collectively contradictory results together with anomalous and unexplained behaviors were observed when glycine was used as a carbon source the highly deviating p release c uptake ratio qiu et al 2020 observed for glycine induced p release of ca accumulibacter challenged the common perception of the p release c uptake mechanisms of paos however no detailed study has been performed to date to validate the effectiveness of glycine as a carbon source for ebpr in a more comprehensive and general sense according to nielsen et al 2010 municipal wastewater contains 25 35 of proteins as cod thus a high occurrence of amino acids in municipal wastewaters is expected they can be up to hundreds of mg l in primary sludge miron et al 2000 and even higher in digestates of sludge digestors higgins et al 2008 glycine concentrations in municipal wastewaters are in the range of 0 02 to 1 70 mg l burleson et al 1980 huang et al 2010 recycling of liquids within wwtps is a common practice and plants may also receive wastewaters from food processing or related industries hence there are a variety of possible sources of high concentrations of glycine in wwtps since glycine was previously reported as a viable or potentially viable carbon source for some paos e g tetrasphaera and ca accumulibacter nguyen et al 2015 oyserman et al 2016 it is of interest to confirm its validity as a carbon source for ebpr activated sludge samples were collected from full scale wwtps and a lab scale sequencing batch reactor sbr and p release and uptake rates with glycine as sole carbon source or in a mixture with acetate were determined to probe its role in ebpr systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 activated sludge 2 1 1 sequencing batch reactor a lab scale sbr with a working volume of 5 l was inoculated with activated sludge collected from a local wwtp the sbr was operated with 6 h cycles including a slow feeding stage 60 min an anaerobic stage 20 min an aerobic stage 180 min and a settling decant stage 100 min acetate was used as a sole carbon source the sbr was operated at an hrt and srt of 12 h and 15 d respectively the ph was controlled at 6 90 7 50 and do levels were maintained at 0 8 1 5 mg l during the aerobic phase the temperature was controlled at 25 c more details of the operational parameters and the composition of the feed wastewater are provided in the supplementary material the long term ebpr activities are presented in fig s1 activated sludge used for batch tests in this study was collected on days 60 85 when thiothrix was the dominant pao fig s2a and fig s3a and days 330 360 with ca accumulibacter as the dominant pao fig s3b where high and stable ebpr removal was achieved 2 1 2 activated sludge samples from full scale wwtps activated sludge samples were collected from three full scale wwtps in

oxic membrane bioreactor the ebpr activities and p removal in the wwtps are shown in table s1 fresh mixed liquor was collected at the end of the aerobic zone of each wwtp for anaerobic aerobic cycle studies all the activated sludge samples were stored at 4 c and tested within 24 h 2 2 glycine as a carbon source for ebpr to investigate the validity of glycine as a carbon source for ebpr an anaerobic p release c uptake test was performed on activated sludge from the lab scale reactor a concentration range of 10 100 mg c l was examined based on the typical range tested in previous studies nguyen et al 2015 marques et al 2017 qiu et al 2019 rey martinez et al 2019 2020 and in wastewater treatment systems activated sludge thiothrix predominated as a pao fig s2a was collected at the end of the aerobic stage and diluted to 1 0 g mixed liquor suspended solids mlss l different mlss concentrations were used in different experiments based on availability of the sample activated sludge using po4 3 p no3 n and no2 n free aerobic effluent from the same reactor two hundred milliliter diluted activated sludge was added to each reactor and purged with nitrogen gas for 15 min to achieve anaerobic conditions glycine was added to respective reactors at different final concentrations 10 25 and 50 mg c l to start the anaerobic p release c uptake test one reactor with no glycine addition served as a control where the same activated sludge was used as in the experimental groups the same applies to all subsequent experiments during the test the temperature was maintained at 30 1 c in a water bath the ph was maintained at 7 25 7 50 using 0 5 m hcl and 0 5 m naoh nitrogen gas was purged continuously to provide an anaerobic condition filtered water samples through 0 45 μm membrane filters were collected at a certain time interval for po4 3 p total nitrogen tn and total organic carbon toc analysis to further confirm the effect of glycine ca accumulibacter pao enriched activated sludge mlss 3 8 g l relative abundance of 45 6 fig s3b from the lab scale sbr on day 360 was further tested glycine or acetate at 100 mg c l was used as a carbon source a group without carbon source

analysis activated sludge samples were collected just before the experiment started 0 min at 10 min anaerobic phase and at 120 min aerobic phase from each group snap frozen in liquid n2 and stored at 80 c for metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis to test gene transcription when glycine was used as a carbon source 2 3 effects of glycine on anaerobic uptake of acetate in applications the co presence of diverse carbon sources is expected to investigate the uptake of acetate in the presence of glycine an experiment was performed in parallel reactors 200 ml as detailed in section 2 2 where activated sludge thiothrix pao predominated fig s2a and fig s3a was collected from the sbr at the end of the aerobic stage and diluted to 2 0 g mlss l using the aerobic effluent of the same reactor the carbon source consisted of 20 mg c l acetate 50 mg c l glycine or a mixture of 20 mg c l acetate and 50 mg c l glycine the p release and c uptake profiles were monitored for 2 h under anaerobic conditions filtered water samples through 0 45 μm membrane filters were collected at a certain time interval for po4 3 p and toc analysis additional experiment was performed using ca accumulibacter enriched activated sludge mlss 3 8 g l the relative abundance of ca accumulibacter was 45 6 as suggested by metagenomic analysis fig s3b following the same procedure but using 50 mg c l acetate 50 mg c l glycine or a mixture of 50 mg c l acetate and 50 mg c l glycine as a carbon source the experiment was done in triplicates 2 4 effects of glycine on aerobic p uptake to further understand the effects of glycine on aerobic p uptake experiments were performed using activated sludge dominated by thiothrix pao fig s2a and fig s3a from the lab scale sbr at the end of the anaerobic stage three hundred milliliters of mixed liquor mlss 4 5 g l were collected from the reactor and equally distributed into 50 ml reactors glycine was added at a final concentration of 0 10 and 50 mg c l air was purged into the reactors to achieve aerobic conditions and p uptake was monitored for 140 min the experiment was done in duplicate filtered water through 0 45 μm membrane filters was collected at certain time intervals for po4 3 p analysis 2 5 persistence of the effects of glycine under aerobic conditions to further understand the persistence of the effects of glycine on aerobic p uptake an experiment was performed by firstly exposing the activated sludge to glycine and then removing it i e glycine followed by an aerobic p uptake test activated sludge collected from the sbr at the end of the anaerobic stage was anaerobically incubated with 100 mg c l glycine for 1 h then the incubated sludge was centrifuged and washed with the reactor supernatant collected at the end of the anaerobic stage to remove any remaining glycine the washed sludge was then subjected to aerobic conditions the p uptake activities were monitored during 2 h activated sludge with no anaerobic glycine incubation served as a control the experiment was done in duplicate 2 6 effects of glycine on p release and uptake activities of activated sludge from full scale wwtps to test the universality of the effects of glycine experiments were performed on five activated sludge samples collected from three full scale wwtps fresh activated sludge was collected from the wwtps at the end of the aerobic zones and then diluted with secondary effluent no2 and no3 free from the corresponding wwtps to a final mlss concentration of 2 0 g l volumes of 1000 ml of mixed liquor were added to three parallel reactors the reactors were initially purged with nitrogen gas for 15 min to achieve anaerobic conditions acetate or glycine was added as a sole carbon source to a final concentration of 30 mg c l to respective reactors a reactor with no carbon source addition served as control the ph was maintained at 7 25 using 0 5 m hcl and 0 5 m naoh the process included a 3 h anaerobic phase and a 3 h aerobic phase filtered water through 0 45 μm membrane filters was collected at certain time intervals for po4 3 p and toc analysis sludge samples were collected and fixed with 2 drops of 40 formaldehyde washed and freeze dried for polyhydroxyalkanoate pha and glycogen analysis additionally experiments were further performed with a mixture of glycine and acetate at different carbon molar ratios of 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 9 0 2 0 8 0 5 0 5 and 0 0 1 0 for activated sludge from wwtp and 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 8 0 5 0 5 and 0 0 1 0 for activated sludge from wwtp2 to investigate the ebpr performance in all cases the final toc concentration was 50 mg l 2 7 analytical methods the mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss nh4 n no3 n po4 3 p and tn were measured following standard methods apha 1999 toc was analyzed

into the ncbi database under bioproject no prjna743190 2 9 metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses were performed on the ca accumulibacter enriched activated sludge samples collected during the full cycle study section 2 2 to elucidate the mechanism of the observed adverse effects of glycine detailed sequencing and data analysis procedures are provided in the supplementary material the obtained data were deposited into the ncbi database under bioproject no prjna771771 3 results and discussion 3 1 glycine as a carbon source for ebpr when glycine was used as a carbon source significantly deviated p release c uptake ratios were observed qiu et al 2020 which is inconsistent with typical pao metabolic models to validate the effectiveness of glycine as a carbon source for ebpr batch tests were performed using activated sludge from a lab scale sbr by adding glycine at different concentrations 10 25 and 50 mg c l respectively significant p release was observed up to 10 3 mg l when glycine was used as a carbon source fig 1 a the extent of p release showed high dependency on the amount of glycine added fig 1a with the p release rate being linearly related to the glycine concentration r2 0 999 p 0 000 in contrast the toc and tn fig 1b levels remained largely unchanged over the entire anaerobic phase suggesting that glycine was not taken up by the microbial community glycine may be fermented to acetate via the glycine serine pyruvate interconversion pathway klein and sagers 1962 hartwich et al 2012 as suggested by nguyen et al 2015 tetrasphaera elongata is able to take up glycine and ferment it to acetate release of acetate was observed under anaerobic conditions accounting for 20 of 13c labeled glycine taken up by the bacteria in their study however the probability of glycine cleavage was low in our system because once glycine had been deaminated to acetate it would have been readily taken up by paos or gaos in view of the unchanged toc and tn profiles and the simple molecular structure of glycine its conversion to other compounds was also unlikely 16s rrna gene amplicon analysis sbr1 in fig s2 suggested that the dominant paos in the sludge were thiothrix relative abundance of 32 4 dechloromonas 4 55 and a small proportion of ca accumulibacter 0 01 together with significant amounts of gaos 19 6 ca competibacter and 0 64 ca contendobacter thiothrix caldifontis has been reported as a pao with a mixotrophic metabolism for p removal rubio rincónet et al 2017 using glutamate as a sole carbon source rey martinez et al 2019 obtained an enrichment culture dominated by thiothrix 37 together with a small amount of ca accumulibacter 7 7 the role of thiothrix as a pao was further confirmed dechloromonas may exhibit both pao and gao phenotypes kong et al 2007 ahn et al 2007 terashima et al 2016 petriglieri et al 2021 and its role in the present study is not clear in view of the high relative abundance of thiothrix which was further confirmed by metagenomic analysis fig s3a it is considered the key pao in our enrichment culture a batch test was also performed with a ca accumulibacter with a relative abundance value of 45 6 as suggested by metagenomic analysis fig s3b enrichment culture similar results were obtained where p was released in the absence of significant glycine uptake confirming that the effect of glycine also applied to ca accumulibacter pao fig s4 collectively these results suggest that neither of these paos or gaos could use glycine as an effective carbon source on the contrary the presence of glycine may have induced a mechanism discussed below resulting in p release by paos without meaningful glycine uptake 3 2 effects of glycine on acetate uptake acetate is a key carbon source for ebpr and is commonly present in municipal wastewater to investigate if glycine could potentially interfere with acetate uptake a batch test was performed with a mixture of 20 mg c l acetate and 50 mg c l glycine as carbon sources using activated sludge from the lab scale sbr sbr1 in fig s2 the presence of glycine did not seem to affect the uptake of acetate since the acetate uptake fig 2 a and p release rates induced by acetate with or without glycine were largely unchanged fig 2b similar results were obtained using activated sludge enriched in ca accumulibacter with a relative abundance value of 45 6 fig s3b fig s5 previous research suggested that acetate uptake by paos ca accumulibacter was mainly achieved via an acetate proton symporter actp driven by the proton motive force pmf garcía martin et al 2006 saunders et al 2007 skennerton et al 2015 oyserman et al 2016 the unaffected acetate uptake in the presence of glycine suggested that glycine did not interfere this pmf related mechanism fig 2a when acetate and glycine were both present the p release rate was slightly higher 10 0 mg p g mlss h than was observed for acetate alone 9 2 mg p g mlss h but was much lower than the sum of the glycine and acetate induced p release rate 14 1 mg p g mlss h when both carbon sources were supplied separately fig 2b showing that the presence of acetate could significantly alleviate the unexpected p release induced by glycine however this result also implies that in a complex carbon context the adverse effects of glycine may be cloaked by the presence of acetate or other carbon sources 3 3 effects of glycine on aerobic p uptake uptake of glycine in the anaerobic phase was not significant fig 1 which would inevitably result in its carry over into the aerobic phase to further understand the effects of glycine on aerobic p uptake an experiment was performed with the activated sludge from the lab scale sbr comprising of thiothrix tetrasphaera dechloromonas at relative abundance values of 9 14 0 58 and 0 23 respectively and ca competibacter and defluviicoccus at relative abundance values of 11 8 and 3 00 sbr2 in fig s2a p release was monitored in the sbr with acetate at a final concentration of 100 mg c l as a sole carbon source fig 3 glycine was added to different concentrations at the beginning of the aerobic phase the presence of glycine in the aerobic phase resulted in a significant reduction in p uptake fig 3 at glycine concentrations of 10 and 50 mg c l the p uptake rates were 72 5 and 59 8 of the control respectively there was a clear negative correlation between p uptake rate and the concentration of glycine showing that the adverse effects of glycine on aerobic p uptake are concentration dependent as well an additional experiment was conducted to investigate the persistence of the adverse effect of glycine on p uptake fig 4 in the anaerobic phase with acetate as sole carbon source 102 7 mg p l was released at a rate of 15 1 mg p g mlss h fig 4 in the following glycine incubation period glycine continued to induce p release at a substantially lower rate 2 3 mg p g mlss h glycine was subsequently removed by centrifugation and washing before the sludge was subjected to aerobic conditions there was no significant difference p value 0 127 between the control group no glycine incubation and the group exposed to glycine suggesting that the effect of glycine on aerobic p uptake did not persist the unchanged p uptake profiles also suggested that a one hour anaerobic exposure to glycine with substantial p release did not have a significant impact on the cell viability of paos however since glycine was not readily removable by other community members the long term occurrence of glycine even at low concentrations and its subsequent impact on paos and other bacteria warrants attention 3 4 effects of glycine on activated sludge from full scale plants to understand the universality of the observed effects of glycine experiments were done on activated sludge from full scale plants with glycine or acetate as carbon sources for comparison in the system with acetate as a carbon source acetate uptake occurred along with p release resulting in p release c uptake ratios of 0 32 0 59 mol p mol c complete acetate uptake was observed at the end the 3 h anaerobic phase with initial carbon uptake rates of 9 59 11 20 mg c g mlss h fig 5 and fig s6 in comparison glycine induced p release of 7 45 8 18 mg p g mlss however only as little as 2 71 of glycine was taken up anaerobically again showing that glycine was not effectively assimilated under these conditions a large portion of glycine remained unutilized and was carried over into the aerobic phase even in the aerobic phase glycine was consumed at extremely low rates 1 36 1 69 mg c g mlss h pha analyses fig s7 showed significant pha formation 10 3 14 6 mg pha g mlss when acetate was used as a carbon source with the acetate uptake to pha formation rates of 0 88 1 07 mol c mol c on the other hand little pha was formed with glycine suggesting that glycine was neither directly used by paos or gaos nor was it converted into acetate or other vfas the results observed for activated sludge from full scale wwtps were in line with those obtained with lab scale sludge suggesting that it is a commonly occurring phenomenon that glycine used as a carbon source induces p release without concurring glycine uptake in the activated sludge from these wwtps a variety of sequences related to paos and gaos were indentified via 16 s rrna gene amplicon sequencing fig s2b ca accumulibacter relative abundence values of 1 40 3 55 followed by tetrasphaera 0 28 1 47 and ca obscuribacter 0 06 1 20 represented known paos ca competibacter 0 87 4 35 dominated the gao community followed by defluviicoccus 0 10 3 17 some tetrasphaera taxa t elongata strain lp2 have been reported as effective glycine users in our study tetrasphaera was detected in all full scale sludge samples relative abundence values up to 1 47 through a regression analysis a strong postive correlation r2 0 819 p 0 008 was observed between the relative abundance of tetrasphaera and the glycine uptake rate fig s8 implying that these tetrasphaera taxa were probably utilizing glycine the p release c uptake ratio for tetrasphaera elongata was reported as 0 48 mol p mol c when glycine was used as a carbon source nguyen et al 2015 while the p c ratios obtained in this study was 0 87 5 20 mol p mol c implying that other pao members besides tetrasphaera in the activated sludge contributed to the majority of p release without glycine uptake in the aerobic phase p release continued instead of any p uptake in all cases further glycine remained largely unutilized after 3 h suggesting that most paos and gaos and other bacteria as well present in the activated sludge could not use glycine even under aerobic conditions again highlighting the noteworthy effects of glycine on ebpr despite the distinct ebpr community compositions all samples showed similar p release characteristics with glycine suggesting that the adverse effect of glycine is a common phenomenon to further validate the effect of glycine on aerobic p uptake by a complex microbial community potential ebpr activities of full scale activated sludge with a community composition as represented in fig s2b as wwtp1 and wwtp2 were evaluated with mixtures of acetate and glycine at different acetate glycine carbon molar ratios as carbon sources fig 6 and fig s9 in general the p release and uptake profiles are in line with those observed using lab scale sludge fig 3 systems with higher proportions of acetate experienced more p release the p release process may be divided into two phases in the first phase acetate uptake was associated with very high p release rates 12 0 27 9 mg p g mlss h in the second phase when acetate was fully consumed the remaining glycine induced continuous p release at lower rates 0 15 2 9 mg p g mlss h despite the different glycine acetate ratios the initial p release rate was largely the same which further confirmed that glycine does not significantly affect acetate uptake fig 3 in the aerobic phase p uptake efficiency was strongly negatively correlated r2 0 999 p value 0 001 with glycine concentration fig 6 and fig s9 at glycine acetate ratios of 0 1 0 9 0 2 0 8 and 0 5 0 5 64 6 55 5 and 8 0 of p released during the anaerobic phase were successfully taken up respectively in contrast to 88 0 when no glycine was present the corresponding p uptake rates were 2 47 0 1 0 9 1 90 0 2 0 8 and 0 34 0 5 0 5 mg p g mlss h compared to 4 30 mg p g mlss h when no glycine was added the presence of glycine at 5 mg c l could reduce the overall p removal efficiency by 23 and the p uptake rate by 42 when glycine was used as sole carbon source continuous p release was observed in the aerobic phase 0 42 mg p g mlss h p release has been reported in the aerobic phase in the presence of acetate as paos seem to prefer to hydrolyze poly p to obtain energy for acetate uptake even in the presence of oxygen serafim et al 2004 pijuan et al 2005 cokro et al 2017 assuming the reduced aerobic p uptake rate was a result of the glycine induced p release under aerobic conditions the rate of p uptake for systems with a mixture of glycine and acetate should be above 2 29 mg p g mlss h however the observed p uptake rates were much lower than that value fig 6 suggesting than p release in the aerobic phase caused by glycine explained only part of the reduction in the p uptake rate in summary the presence of glycine in the aerobic phase significantly reduced the p uptake rate despite the potential adverse effects of glycine on ebpr which needs attention this unique property of glycine may be utilizable ebpr results in a buildup of p in the activated sludge facilitating down stream p recovery p may be readily recovered from the sludge digestion supernatant or the ashes of sludge incineration desmidt et al 2015 however if the waste sludge is to be sent to a landfill or used as construction material meda et al 2021 pertinent ways to induce p release effectively and sustainably from the waste sludge are necessary for p recovery the ability of glycine to induce p release without being taken up by the cell points to a novel method for p extraction and recovery from the ebpr sludge high and continuous p release could be obtained at the expense of a very small amount of glycine the rate of p release may also be adjustable by altering the concentration of glycine making it a pertinent and environmental friendly approach for p extraction from ebpr sludge thus facilitating downstream p recovery simoes et al 2020 additionally the inability of a wide range of paos and gaos to use glycine highlights a promising way for community regulation and or enrichment of specific lineages of paos e g tetrasphaera elongata related taxa nguyen et al 2015 3 5 possible mechanisms of the adverse effects of glycine on paos using activated sludge from lab scale sbr reactor and full scale wwtps table 1 this study demonstrated an overall adverse effect of glycine on paos and ebpr acetate uptake which is driven by the pmf garcía martin et al 2006 skennerton et al 2015 oyserman et al 2016 was not affected by the presence of glycine fig 2 suggesting that glycine was not interrupting the transmembrane pmf otherwise either acetate uptake or acetate induced p release would be affected burow et al 2008 saunders et al 2007 additionally the persistence experiment fig 4 showed that glycine did not affect the viability of paos during short term exposure 60 min its impact on p uptake disappeared once it was removed from the system although amino acids are essential nutrients for bacteria their high intracellular concentrations cause feedback inhibitions and cytotoxicity eggeling and sahm 2003 jones et al 2015 it seems that the observed p release was probably related to mechanisms involving lowering glycine concentrations in cells preventing its accumulation in the cytoplasm indeed there is a commonly occurring defense mechanism in the form of efflux pumps which allow bacteria to extrude toxic or unfavorable substrates it is possible that paos used them to export the unfavorable glycine against a concentration gradient which consumed atp and resulted in p release fig 7 active efflux pumps were identified or predicted to reduce intracellular amino acids and thereby alleviate toxicity for bacteria jones et al 2015 overexpression of the yded gene in e coli encoding a membrane protein belonging to the drug metabolite transporter dmt superfamily resulted in the export of intercellularly accumulated l cysteine indicating that e coli mitigates l cysteine toxicity by employing efflux pumps dassler et al 2000 similar genes were also found in the cases of alanine hori et al 2011a b isoleucine valine leucine methionine kennerknecht et al 2002 and threonine aleshin et al 1999 another strong piece of evidence to support the efflux pump hypothesis is that the anaerobic p release rate was dependent on the glycine concentration fig 1a regression analysis showed a strong linear correlation r2 0 999 p value 0 000 between p release rate and glycine concentration at higher extracellular glycine concentrations increased influx of glycine into bacterial cells along the concentration gradient is expected to maintain a low intracellular glycine concentration increased energy is needed for active transport of glycine against the concentration gradient resulting in increased poly p hydrolysis and p release in our study a glycine acetate mixture induced a slightly higher p release rate 10 0 mg p g mlss h than acetate alone 9 2 mg p g mlss h but was far below the sum of the individual rates when only acetate or glycine were provided 14 1 mg p g mlss h fig 2 the presence of acetate resulted in a small amount 5 01 mg c l within 2 h of glycine uptake under anaerobic conditions fig 2a a possible reason is that glycine serves as a nitrogen source rather than a carbon source in this case hartung and ratcliffe 2002 kong et al 2004 glycine can be used by bacteria as a nitrogen source e g escherichia coli k12 and other newman et al 1976 sinclair and dawes 1995 a similar phenomenon was also reported by kong et al 2004 where amino acids leucine and thymidine could not be taken up as sole substrates by rhodocyclus related paos but were assimilated if acetate was also present as indicated by microautoradiography mar analysis pao metabolism by ca accumulibacter clade iia strain uw 1 significantly increased during anaerobic acetate contact as suggested by increased gene transcription oyserman et al 2016 with increased metabolic activities the cellular demand for glycine serving as nitrogen source or substrate for the synthesis of proteins would also increase hartung and ratcliffe 2002 kong et al 2004 in this case less efflux of glycine is expected fig 7 resulting in a significantly lower p release in the acetate glycine mixture system compared to the sum of individual acetate and glycine rates at the same concentrations in tests using only one carbon source fig 2b and fig s5 after glycine had been removed from the system fig 4 the unexpected p release in the aerobic phase stopped and p uptake returned to a normal level this observation also supports the efflux hypothesis to verify the efflux hypothesis metatranscriptomic analyses were performed on activated sludge samples collected during the glycine exposure batch experiment the corresponding physicochemical results are shown in fig s4 with an acetate receiving treatment group as a contrast and the no carbon source group as control the activated sludge used was from the ca accumulibacter enrichment culture fig s3b a gene encoding the permease of the drug metabolite transporter dmt superfamily was highly transcribed in the presence of glycine 178 3 times higher than the control group no expression of this gene in the acetate group fig 8 a supporting the efflux hypothesis additionally genes encoding the trap type c4 dicarboxylate transport system fig 8b together with a na h antiporter fig 8c were highly transcribed in the glycine treatment group a trap type c4 dicarboxylate transport system was also reported to be responsible for the uptake of amino acids driven by the sodium motive force smf wösten et al 2017 while the na h antiporter may have played a role in establishing an electrochemical potential of na across the cytoplasmic membrane i e the smf hiramatsu et al 1998 it is likely that glycine was transported into the cells via the trap type c4 dicarboxylate transport system fig 7 however the imported glycine was not metabolized as suggested by the low transcription of the genes encoding the glycine cleavage system proteins specifically although genes encoding the glycine cleavage system t p and h protein seemed to have been upregulated fig 8d f transcription of the downstream l protein fig 8g the glycine serine hydroxymethyltransferase fig 8h and the threonine dehydratase fig 8i genes were significantly lowered compared to those in the control and the acetate treatment group suggesting potential feedback inhibitions of glycine collectively glycine seems to have been taken up by paos via the trap type c4 dicarboxylate transport system at the expense of smf however it was not metabolized due to the inactivation of the downstream glycine cleavage system genes fig 8g i the accumulation of glycine in the cell induced the dmt efflux mechanism fig 7 as a result glycine was not consumed significantly in the liquid phase but the activation of the uptake and efflux systems consumed atp resulting in unexpected p release fig 7 4 conclusions this work reported for the first time the adverse effects of glycine on paos and ebpr systems glycine induced p release anaerobically without being taken up by cells implying that glycine is not a valid carbon source for most paos and gaos from lab scale and full scale systems the p release rate in anaerobic conditions and the reduction in the p uptake rate in aerobic conditions are linearly related to the concentration of glycine in activated sludge with diverse and distinct microbial communities suggesting an overall adverse effect of glycine on pao metabolism the co existence of glycine did not affect acetate uptake anaerobically but significantly lowered the p uptake in the aerobic phase implying the coexistence of multiple carbon sources in sewage may mask the adverse effect of glycine adding to difficulties in realizing and detecting the impacts of glycine on ebpr systems during short term exposure 1 h the adverse effect of glycine on p uptake is transient and disappears after removing glycine from the system however glycine is neither readily usable by diverse paos and gaos nor easily degradable by other microorganisms in both full scale wwtps and lab scale reactors under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions the presence or accidental introduction of glycine into the ebpr system could be highly detrimental and should be avoided apart from its potential threats to ebpr systems these unique properties of glycine make it a sustainable and low cost agent for p extraction and recovery from ebpr sludge supplementary material table s1 s3 fig s1 s9 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

16412,this research explored the effects of eukaryotic predation on nitrifying membrane aerated biofilm reactor mabr biofilms past research on heterotrophic mabr biofilms showed that predation could create internal voids that promoted sloughing however the no past research addressed the effects of predation on nitrifying mabrs even though nitrification is the most common mabr application nitrifying biofilms are typically denser and ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob form large dense clusters within the biofilm this could affect their susceptibility to predation nitrifying biofilms were grown in flat sheet mabrs images of the biofilm were captured using optical coherence tomography oct for detachment tests an increased shear flow re 140 was used and a shear rheometer was used to measure the biofilm mechanical properties the nitrifying community was analyzed with fluorescence in situ hybridization fish and quantitative pcr qpcr predation increased internal void ratios from 54 5 to 69 6 biofilms were weakened by predation with a storage modulus g and loss modulus g of 242 135 and 1 649 853 pa with predation and 3 644 1 857 and 23 334 11 481 pa for the control with suppressed predation predation increased the relative biofilm detachment from 4 5 to 18 12 decreased the amount of biomass i e the average biofilm thickness from 502 150 to 266 54 µm and decreased the nitrification flux from 1 00 to 0 61 g nh4 n m2day also predation decreased the abundance of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob relative to aob consistent with the observed nitritation these results show that predation can significantly impact the structural stability bacterial community and removal rates of nitrifying mabr biofilms lumping the effects of predation into the detachment or decay coefficients of biofilm models may not accurately reflect the behavior of nitrifying mabr biofilms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords protozoa nitrification mabrs biofilms mechanical properties 1 introduction protozoa commonly prey on bacteria and are found in most mixed culture microbial systems in suspended growth systems protozoan predation has been shown to affect population dynamics huws et al 2005 sinclair and alexander 1989 verhagen and laanbroek 1992 wildschutte et al 2004 yu et al 2011 accelerate substrate mineralization and release of nutrients bloem et al 1988 davidson et al 1990 griffiths 1994 kuikman et al 1989 parry 2004 and affect contaminant removal rates in bioreactors moussa et al 2005 revilla et al 2016 despite the significant effects of predation on suspended bacteria biofilms are commonly thought to be more resistant to predation luxmy et al 2000 matz et al 2002 pernthaler et al 1996 however some research has shown that protozoa can significantly affect biofilms for example protozoa reduced nitrification rates by nearly 50 in a suspended biofilm reactor lee and welander 1994 and significantly reduced the abundance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and anaerobic ammonium oxidizing anammox bacteria in a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr for wastewater treatment suarez et al 2015 predation doubled the permeate fluxes and increased biofilm surface heterogeneity in ultrafiltration membranes treating river water derlon et al 2012 most past research on biofilm predation addressed aerobic co diffusional biofilms in co diffusional biofilms o2 and the electron donor diffuse from the bulk liquid into the biofilm thus the outer biofilm typically has highest bacterial growth rates due to the higher oxygen concentrations and exposure to the bulk liquid it also is typically where protozoan predation is greatest in contrast mabrs are counter diffusional with o2 diffusing from the base of the biofilms and the outer biofilm and bulk anoxic thus the most favorable zone for predation is the aerobic base of the biofilm where bacterial growth rates are typically low for example in heterotrophic mabrs predation produced a continuous void layer near the base of the membrane due to predation and lack of microbial growth aybar et al 2019 this void layer was found to weaken the biofilm and promote sloughing kim et al 2020 despite the unique effects of predation on heterotrophic mabrs most mabrs are used for nitrification and it is not clear if the effects would be the same nitrifying bacteria have slower growth rates so the effects of predation could be more significant however aob typically form tight clusters within the biofilm while nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and heterotrophs are typically dispersed around the aob clusters manser et al 2005 this clustering could make aob more resistant to predation than nob the loss of nob in turn could promote partial nitrification which is beneficial for many applications including the anammox process pérez et al 2020 to evaluate the effects of predation on nitrifying mabrs lab scale flow cells were used to assess the effects of detachment on 1

two types of biofilm flow cells were used for this research small three channel mabr flow cells were used to assess nitrification rates biofilm thickness presence of internal voids detachment and microbial community structure larger single channel flow cells were used to assess biofilm mechanical properties each reactor was run under normal conditions i e with predation base condition and with a eukaryotic inhibitor to suppress predation suppressed condition 2 1 experimental setup and operating conditions as mentioned above large and small mabr flow cells were used to assess the effects of predation nitrification performance and biofilm thickness were measured over time until the reactor reached steady state steady state conditions were achieved when the biofilm thickness and nitrification performance varied by less than 5 over two weeks once steady state was reached the small flow cells were used to determine nitrification fluxes the biofilm thickness void ratio microbial community and biofilm detachment the larger flow cells were used to assess biofilm mechanical properties all experiments were assessed in triplicate for the large flow cells mechanical properties from

detachment test a 5 mm by 3 mm section of silicone membrane was cut with a sterile scalpel near the inflow port of each of three replicate reactors a new strip of silicone membrane was glued in its place the membrane extraction reduced the total area of biofilm in each flow cell by less than 5 minimizing impacts on the subsequent detachment tests since each reactor had two membranes i e upper

following settings 1 33 refractive index 30 khz image frequency 101 db sensitivity the 2d images had 4 08 and 2 04 µm of horizontal and vertical pixel size respectively the number of pixels in an image varied depending on the length of the scanned biofilms the 2d biofilm profile images were used to assess biofilm growth average thickness internal void abundance and detachment biofilms grew on the inner sides of the silicone membranes i e inside the flow cell however since the silicone membranes were translucent to oct it was possible to image them non destructively from the outside i e without removing the membranes from the flow cell the biofilm profiling method followed kim et al 2020 for each flow cell 18 biofilm profiles were taken along lines drawn on the membrane i e 9 profiles from the upper membrane and 9 from the lower membrame see fig 2 the average biofilm cross sectional area and voids size was calculated using the 18 images for comparison of the biofilm before and after detachment reference marks drawn on each flow cell were used to image the same locations 2 10 image analysis both oct and fish images were exported to a matlab routine to determine biofilm areas and internal void fractions following lewandowski and beyenal 2013 images were digitally processed to 1 remove background noise and separate biofilm structure 2 convert the image to gray scale 3 transform the gray scale images into binary images i e black and white using an iterative thresholding process and 4 transform the binary images into a data matrix for calculating areas for the oct images which were biofilm cross sections perpendicular to the membrane the total biofilm cross sectional area was determined as the total number of filled pixels i e both void and filled pixels the internal void fraction was determined as the ratio of internal void pixels to the total number of pixels void pixels outside of biofilm profiles were not included the oct scale bar was used to convert pixels into microns the 100 μ m scale bar was measured as 25 5 pixels with the matlab routine then this ratio 3 92 µm pixel was used to convert pixels into a numerical biofilm area for the detachment tests the amount of detached biomass was assessed by the relative detached area and ts the total detached area m m 2 the initial biofilm area m m 2 100 and the relative detached ts ts removed mg the initial biofilm area m m 2 for the fish analysis the areas occupied by aob nob and all bacteria were determined the same threshold value was used for both base and suppressed conditions to reduce the bias by the choice of threshold value the biofilm area for aob and nob was used for quantifying the relative abundance of aob and nob i e aob aob nob 2 11 biofilm mechanical properties a shear rheometer hr 2 discovery hybrid rheometer ta instruments new castle delaware usa was used to determine the biofilm storage modulus g and loss modulus g for the base and suppressed conditions following moresi et al 2004 and towler et al 2003 an 8 mm diameter stainless steel plate with parallel geometry was used the zero gap was set using a clean flat sheet silicone membrane the gap between two plates was set as the average biofilm thickness which was previously determined by oct next the biofilm attached membrane was removed from the reactor with a scalpel and immediately transferred to the lower plate of the rheometer a drop of pbs buffer was added to prevent biofilm dehydration dynamic strain sweep tests were performed with a 1 hz frequency a temperature of 25 c and a strain range of 0 01 to 100 the storage and loss moduli were measured as a function of shear strain for each measurement g and g were obtained by averaging the values within the linear viscoelastic region four different locations on the same biofilm sample were tested in each condition as replicates 3 results the abundance number of protozoa in each reactor was determined by ddpcr which provided the amount of protozoa relative to the sum of protozoa bacteria for the base condition the relative abundance of protozoa was 5 6 1 2 while for the suppressed condition it was 1 5 0 4 fig 3 see figure s3 in the si for a table of the absolute copy numbers for protozoa and bacteria 3 1 operation of small flow cells after inoculation the small flow cells were run continuously to steady state fig 4 all tests and measurements were conducted around two weeks after reaching steady state for the base condition i e the biofilm affected by predation steady state was reached after around 61 days at this point the average biofilm thickness for the three replicates was around 150 20 µm and the average effluent concentration for three flow cells was 85 5 0 5 12 5 1 0 and 0 8 0 3 mg n l for nh4 no2 and no3 respectively the average ammonium removal flux was 0 84 0 02 g nh4 n m2day for the suppressed condition steady state was reached at around 68 days the average biofilm thickness was around 250 70 µm and the average effluent concentration was 76 0 1 8 1 5 0 3 and 9 4 1 03 mg n l for nh4 no2 and no3 2 respectively also the average nitrogen removal flux was around 1 42 0 13 gnh4 n m2day 3 2 effects of predation on voids and detachment biofilm internal voids and biofilm detachment were determined by oct for internal voids the analysis was conducted just prior to the detachment tests the internal void ratios were 69 6 for the base condition and 54 4 for the suppressed condition fig 5 detachment was assessed by oct analysis and effluent ts fig 6 shows typical oct images before and after the detachment tests the detachment ratios were 18 13 for the base condition and 4 5 for the suppressed condition fig 5 the ts concentration was 2101 300 mgts mm2 for the base condition and 180 80 mgts mm2 for the suppressed condition the ts values before the detachment tests were negligible both void and detached ratio differences between the base and suppressed conditions were statistically significant t test p 0 05 3 3 effects of predation on the nitrifying community qpcr was used to determine the relative abundance of nob i e the amount of nob relative to nob aob for the base condition the relative abundance of nob was 0 2 0 1 while for the suppressed condition it was 3 6 2 0 fig 7 thus the relative abundance of nob was around an order of magnitude lower for the base condition for the suppressed condition see figure s4 in the si for a table of the absolute copy numbers for amoa and nxrb the fish analysis also showed that aob were more abundant than nob and that aob formed large cluster figure s5 in the si the relative abundance of nob i e nob aob nob was 9 6 for the base condition and 45 12 for the suppressed condition based on the data from fish images the trends are consistent with the qpcr results effects of predation on biofilm mechanical properties rheometry tests were conducted on the large flow cells to determine the biofilm mechanical properties fig 9 the storage modulus elastic behavior was 1650 853 pa for the base condition and 23 300 11 500 pa for the suppressed condition the loss modulus viscous behavior was 242 135 pa for the base condition and 3640 1860 pa for suppressed condition 4 discussion in this study the only difference between base and suppressed predation reactors was the abundance of protozoa fig 3 this suggests that the differences between the two were caused by predation 4 1 effects of predation on nitrification performance the ammonium removal flux was 0 84 0 02 and 1 42 0 13 gnh4 n m2day for the base and suppressed conditions respectively the lower flux for the base condition was probably due to its lower thickness which likely resulted from predation also the removal fluxes for both base and suppressed conditions were lower than reported for other mabr systems with silicone membranes augusto et al 2018 hsieh et al 2002 removal fluxes are affected by many factors such as the influent loading type of substrate air supply pressure and membrane materials the low flux in this study may be due to the passive air supply without pressurization which could have limited o2 concentrations within the biofilm the negative effects of predation on nitrification fluxes may be compensated by increasing the air pressure as this could increase the nitrification rates fenchel 2014 results also suggest that predation enhanced nitritation the result of fish and qpcr indicates that nob both nitrospira and nitrobacter were more affected by predation than aob conversion of nh4 to no2 and no3 for the base condition was 86 and 6 respectively on the other hand conversion of nh4 to no2 and no3 for the suppressed condition was 28 and 47 respectively this may be because the effects of predation on nob were greater than on aob fig 7 the result of this study showed that predation could affects the nitrifying community past studies on both heterotrophic and nitrifying microbial communities from both suspended and biofilms also found that predation affects bacterial abundance and diversity corno et al 2008 hahn et al 1999 hahn and hofle 2001 1999 jürgens and matz 2002 simek et al 1997 simek and kojecka 1999 suarez et al 2015 verhagen and laanbroek 1992 wey et al 2012 yu et al 2011 in this study the amount of biomass was compared by quantifying the average cross sectional area of biofilms where base and suppressed predation showed 0 5 0 1 and 0 9 0 3 mm2 respectively this result is similar to studies by rensink and rulkens 1997 where suppression of protozoa increased biomass production rates however other researchers found that predation had little influence on the nitrification performance in suspended growth systems lee and oleszkiewicz 2003 yu et al 2011 lee and welander 1994 found that the suppression of protozoa doubled nitrification rates but did not affect the biofilm thickness one possible reason for the unaltered thickness is because they added the prokaryotic inhibitor after the biofilm was fully grown whereas our study added cycloheximide since the initial biofilm formation 4 2 effects of predation on the internal structure of nitrifying biofilms past research on heterotrophic biofilms has shown that predation increased the amount of internal voids aybar et al 2019 for example for a heterotrophic mabr biofilm the internal void ratio was 6 7 when predation was suppressed compared to 50 16 when predation was not suppressed kim et al 2020 similarly the internal void ratio was 45 5 5 4 in another study on heterotrophic mabr biofilms where predation was noted aybar et al 2019 our study with nitrifying mabr biofilms showed similar results where the void ratio was 69 6 for base condition but only 54 4 for the suppressed condition interestingly the internal voids ratio of nitrifying biofilms 54 4 was greater than that of heterotrophic biofilms with suppressed predation i e 6 7 kim et al 2020 for both studies there was some effects of predation even with cyloheximide this is because cycloheximide as a eukaryote inhibitor did not completely inhibit protozoa the difference of the internal voids may be caused by the growth rate difference between heterotrophic and nitrifying bacteria in aybar et al 2019 there was an inverse relationship between the bacterial growth rates and the formation of internal voids when the concentration of substrate in the bulk was high i e a higher growth rate the internal voids ratio was low in our study the bulk ammonium concentration was not limiting for either condition however the inherently slow growth kinetics of nitrifying bacteria matsumoto et al 2007 picioreanu et al 2016 may have caused the higher internal void ratio in the suppressed condition 4 3 predation and microbial community in this study predation affected nob more than aob this dominance of aob over nob fig 7 could be explained by the different growth rates of aob and nob in this past research the effects of predation were related to the growth rate of their prey the formation of internal voids by predation was significantly reduced when the growth rate of bacteria was high with the high substrate condition aybar et al 2019 the maximum specific growth rate µmax of aob is greater than nob in most studies hunik et al 1994 munz et al 2011 picioreanu et al 2016 wiesmann 2005 but this difference is not enough to explain the dramatic reduction of nob in this study fig 8 2 the difference of the half saturation coefficient ks o2 between aob and nob is more significant than that of the maximum growth rate considering this study was carried out with unpressurized air i e o2 limiting conditions the growth conditions are more favorable for aob than for nob however the smaller value of the half saturation coefficient ks substrate of nob contradicts the higher growth rate of aob this effect can be compensated by that the concentration of nh4 is much higher than that of no2 in bulk liquid also the result of predation is the mineralization of organic nitrogen to nh4 bloem et al 1988 kuikman et al 1991 which gives an additional benefit to aob another possible explanation for the dominance of aob over nob fig 7 is the different size of cell clusters protozoa shows size selective grazing because of morphological limitations jürgens and matz 2002 matz et al 2002 specifically the larger size of cells or cell clusters shows the greater resistance to grazing pernthaler et al 1996 previous research has shown the size of aob clusters was greater than that of nob manser et al 2005 picioreanu et al 2016 suggesting the greater effects of predation on nob than aob a similar result was shown in fish analysis of this study the average cell cluster size for aob 10 μ m was larger than that of nob 1 μ m see figure s5 in the si which provides fish images showing cluster sizes of aob and nob in four different samples 4 4 mechanical properties in our studies the base condition with predation had more voids fig 5 greater detachment fig 5 and weaker mechanical properties than the suppressed condition fig 9 a positive correlation between internal voids detachment and mechanical properties was previously shown for heterotrophic mabr biofilms kim et al 2020 however the absolute value of viscous i e loss modulus and elastic i e storage modulus properties were quite different the loss modulus 3640 1860 pa and storage modulus 23 300 11 500 pa of nitrifying mabr biofilms for suppressed condition were higher than the loss modulus 1580 729 pa and storage modulus 9800 4290 pa of heterotrophic mabr biofilms for conditions with suppressed predation this may result from the difference in strength between nitrifying and heterotrophic biofilms past researches show that slow growing biofilms are more resistant to sloughing pellicer nàcher and smets 2014 picioreanu et al 2000 tijhuis et al 1995 van loosdrecht et al 1995 heterotrophic biofilms often grow fast resulting in low density irregular protuberances that are more susceptible to detachment or sloughing on the other hand in slow growing nitrifying biofilms the low density protuberances either are not formed or are readily removed by shear in bulk leaving dense basal part the comparison of detachment between nitrifying and heterotrophic biofilms for suppressed condition also shows heterotrophic biofilms are more susceptible to sloughing than nitrifying biofilms where the detachment ratios of nitrifying and heterotrophic biofilms were 4 5 this study and 7 9 kim et al 2020 respectively this study shows that predation can decrease the inherent differences in mechanical properties between heterotrophic and nitrifying mabr biofilms for the base condition the loss modulus 242 135 pa and storage modulus 1650 853 pa of nitrifying biofilms was similar to the loss 363 189 pa modulus and storage modulus 1780 1180 pa of heterotrophic biofilms this is because predation affects the dense basal layer near the membrane in our study effects of predation were mainly seen near the membrane fig 6 where the concentration of oxygen was maximum but the concentration of substrate was minimum in this condition the predation rate can surpass the growth rate of bacteria resulting in increase of internal voids aybar et al 2019 since the bottom layer was compromised by voids in nitrifying biofilms as well sloughing occurred for the base condition the detachment ratios of the nitrifying and heterotrophic mabr biofilms were 18 13 this study and 44 24 kim et al 2020 respectively a possible reason for the higher detachment ratio for heterotrophic mabr biofilms may be that they were affected by both erosion on the low density protuberances near the bulk and sloughing on basal layer near membrane it could also be caused by the different shear stresses during the detachment due to the different roughness data is not shown and average thickness of nitrifying 150 µm this study and heterotrophic mabr biofilms 200 µm kim et al 2020 this result suggests the relationship between detachment and mechanical properties is not linear it means the direct estimate of detachment through the value of mechanical properties should be combined with many other factors such as internal voids bacterial community and the composition of eps 5 conclusion the major findings of this research are predation can reduce nitrification removal fluxes probably due to biomass loss the production of internal voids by predation is significant in nitrifying mabr biofilms predation weakens the mechanical properties of nitrifying biofilms which can increase biofilm detachment predation affects nob more than aob in nitrifying biofilms these results show that predation affects biomass accumulation bacterial community structure mechanical strength and reactor performance for nitrifying mabr biofilms an in depth understanding of predation is critical to control those effects further research should address the kinetics of predation in biofilms currently effects of predation are often lumped into the detachment or decay coefficients of biofilms this approach does not accurately assess the effects of predation in biofilms also while traditional monod kinetics has been used to estimate the kinetics of protozoa this has not been confirmed experimentally an improved kinetic model for

16412,this research explored the effects of eukaryotic predation on nitrifying membrane aerated biofilm reactor mabr biofilms past research on heterotrophic mabr biofilms showed that predation could create internal voids that promoted sloughing however the no past research addressed the effects of predation on nitrifying mabrs even though nitrification is the most common mabr application nitrifying biofilms are typically denser and ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob form large dense clusters within the biofilm this could affect their susceptibility to predation nitrifying biofilms were grown in flat sheet mabrs images of the biofilm were captured using optical coherence tomography oct for detachment tests an increased shear flow re 140 was used and a shear rheometer was used to measure the biofilm mechanical properties the nitrifying community was analyzed with fluorescence in situ hybridization fish and quantitative pcr qpcr predation increased internal void ratios from 54 5 to 69 6 biofilms were weakened by predation with a storage modulus g and loss modulus g of 242 135 and 1 649 853 pa with predation and 3 644 1 857 and 23 334 11 481 pa for the control with suppressed predation predation increased the relative biofilm detachment from 4 5 to 18 12 decreased the amount of biomass i e the average biofilm thickness from 502 150 to 266 54 µm and decreased the nitrification flux from 1 00 to 0 61 g nh4 n m2day also predation decreased the abundance of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob relative to aob consistent with the observed nitritation these results show that predation can significantly impact the structural stability bacterial community and removal rates of nitrifying mabr biofilms lumping the effects of predation into the detachment or decay coefficients of biofilm models may not accurately reflect the behavior of nitrifying mabr biofilms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords protozoa nitrification mabrs biofilms mechanical properties 1 introduction protozoa commonly prey on bacteria and are found in most mixed culture microbial systems in suspended growth systems protozoan predation has been shown to affect population dynamics huws et al 2005 sinclair and alexander 1989 verhagen and laanbroek 1992 wildschutte et al 2004 yu et al 2011 accelerate substrate mineralization and release of nutrients bloem et al 1988 davidson et al 1990 griffiths 1994 kuikman et al 1989 parry 2004 and affect contaminant removal rates in bioreactors moussa et al 2005 revilla et al 2016 despite the significant effects of predation on suspended bacteria biofilms are commonly thought to be more resistant to predation luxmy et al 2000 matz et al 2002 pernthaler et al 1996 however some research has shown that protozoa can significantly affect biofilms for example protozoa reduced nitrification rates by nearly 50 in a suspended biofilm reactor lee and welander 1994 and significantly reduced the abundance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and anaerobic ammonium oxidizing anammox bacteria in a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr for wastewater treatment suarez et al 2015 predation doubled the permeate fluxes and increased biofilm surface heterogeneity in ultrafiltration membranes treating river water derlon et al 2012 most past research on biofilm predation addressed aerobic co diffusional biofilms in co diffusional biofilms o2 and the electron donor diffuse from the bulk liquid into the biofilm thus the outer biofilm typically has highest bacterial growth rates due to the higher oxygen concentrations and exposure to the bulk liquid it also is typically where protozoan predation is greatest in contrast mabrs are counter diffusional with o2 diffusing from the base of the biofilms and the outer biofilm and bulk anoxic thus the most favorable zone for predation is the aerobic base of the biofilm where bacterial growth rates are typically low for example in heterotrophic mabrs predation produced a continuous void layer near the base of the membrane due to predation and lack of microbial growth aybar et al 2019 this void layer was found to weaken the biofilm and promote sloughing kim et al 2020 despite the unique effects of predation on heterotrophic mabrs most mabrs are used for nitrification and it is not clear if the effects would be the same nitrifying bacteria have slower growth rates so the effects of predation could be more significant however aob typically form tight clusters within the biofilm while nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and heterotrophs are typically dispersed around the aob clusters manser et al 2005 this clustering could make aob more resistant to predation than nob the loss of nob in turn could promote partial nitrification which is beneficial for many applications including the anammox process pérez et al 2020 to evaluate the effects of predation on nitrifying mabrs lab scale flow cells were used to assess the effects of detachment on 1

microbial community structure larger single channel flow cells were used to assess biofilm mechanical properties each reactor was run under normal conditions i e with predation base condition and with a eukaryotic inhibitor to suppress predation suppressed condition 2 1 experimental setup and operating conditions as mentioned above large and small mabr flow cells were used to assess the effects of predation nitrification performance and biofilm thickness were measured over time until the reactor reached steady state steady state conditions were achieved when the biofilm thickness and nitrification performance varied by less than 5 over two weeks once steady state was reached the small flow cells were used to determine nitrification fluxes the biofilm thickness void ratio microbial

detachment test a 5 mm by 3 mm section of silicone membrane was cut with a sterile scalpel near the inflow port of each of three replicate reactors a new strip of silicone membrane was glued in its place the membrane extraction reduced the total area of biofilm in each flow cell by less than 5 minimizing impacts on the subsequent detachment tests since each reactor had two membranes i e upper and lower six samples in total were taken for each condition i e two membranes from each of the three replicate reactors for each condition dna was extracted from each biofilm sample using a dneasy

following settings 1 33 refractive index 30 khz image frequency 101 db sensitivity the 2d images had 4 08 and 2 04 µm of horizontal and vertical pixel size respectively the number of pixels in an image varied depending on the length of the scanned biofilms the 2d biofilm profile images were used to assess biofilm growth average thickness internal void abundance and detachment biofilms grew on the inner sides of the silicone membranes i e inside the flow cell however since the silicone membranes were translucent to oct it was possible to image them non destructively from the outside i e without removing the membranes from the flow cell the biofilm profiling method followed kim et al 2020 for each flow cell 18 biofilm profiles were taken along lines drawn on the membrane i e 9 profiles from the upper membrane and 9 from the lower membrame see fig 2 the average biofilm cross sectional area and voids size was calculated using the 18 images for comparison of the biofilm before and after detachment reference marks drawn on each flow cell were used to image the same locations 2 10 image analysis both oct and fish images were exported to a matlab routine to determine biofilm areas and internal void fractions following lewandowski and beyenal 2013 images were digitally processed to 1 remove background noise and separate biofilm structure 2 convert the image to gray scale 3 transform the gray scale images into binary images i e black and white using an iterative thresholding process and 4 transform the binary images into a data matrix for calculating areas for the oct images which were biofilm cross sections perpendicular to the membrane the total biofilm cross sectional area was determined as the total number of filled pixels i e both void and filled pixels the internal void fraction was determined as the ratio of internal void pixels to the total number of pixels void pixels outside of biofilm profiles were not included the oct scale bar was used to convert pixels into microns the 100 μ m scale bar was measured as 25 5 pixels with the matlab routine then this ratio 3 92 µm pixel was used to convert pixels into a numerical biofilm area for the detachment tests the amount of detached biomass was assessed by the relative detached area and ts the total detached area m m 2 the initial biofilm area m m 2 100 and the relative detached ts ts removed mg the initial biofilm area m m 2 for the fish analysis the areas occupied by aob nob and all bacteria were determined the same threshold value was used for both base and suppressed conditions to reduce the bias by the choice of threshold value the biofilm area for aob and nob was used for quantifying the relative abundance of aob and nob i e aob aob nob 2 11 biofilm mechanical properties a shear rheometer hr 2 discovery hybrid rheometer ta instruments new castle delaware usa was used to determine the biofilm storage modulus g and loss modulus g for the base and suppressed conditions following moresi et al 2004 and towler et al 2003 an 8 mm diameter stainless steel plate with parallel geometry was used the zero gap was set using a clean flat sheet silicone membrane the gap between two plates was set as the average biofilm thickness which was previously determined by oct next the biofilm attached membrane was removed from the reactor with a scalpel and immediately transferred to the lower plate of the rheometer a drop of pbs buffer was added to prevent biofilm dehydration dynamic strain sweep tests were performed with a 1 hz frequency a temperature of 25 c and a strain range of 0 01 to 100 the storage and loss moduli were measured as a function of shear strain for each measurement g and g were obtained by averaging the values within the linear viscoelastic region four different locations on the same biofilm sample were tested in each condition as replicates 3 results the abundance number of protozoa in each reactor was determined by ddpcr which provided the amount of protozoa relative to the sum of protozoa bacteria for the base condition the relative abundance of protozoa was 5 6 1 2 while for the suppressed condition it was 1 5 0 4 fig 3 see figure s3 in the si for a table of the absolute copy numbers for protozoa and bacteria 3 1 operation of small flow cells after inoculation the small flow cells were run continuously to steady state fig 4 all tests and measurements were conducted around two weeks after reaching steady state for the base condition i e the biofilm affected by predation steady state was reached after around 61 days at this point the average biofilm thickness for the three replicates was around 150 20 µm and the average effluent concentration for three flow cells was 85 5 0 5 12 5 1 0 and 0 8 0 3 mg n l for nh4 no2 and no3 respectively the average ammonium removal flux was 0 84 0 02 g nh4 n m2day for the suppressed condition steady state was reached at around 68 days the average biofilm thickness was around 250 70 µm and the average effluent concentration was 76 0 1 8 1 5 0 3 and 9 4 1 03 mg n l for nh4 no2 and no3 2 respectively also the average nitrogen removal flux was around 1 42 0 13 gnh4 n m2day 3 2 effects of predation on voids and detachment biofilm internal voids and biofilm detachment were determined by oct for internal voids the analysis was conducted just prior to the detachment tests the internal void ratios were 69 6 for the base condition and 54 4 for the suppressed condition fig 5 detachment was assessed by oct analysis and effluent ts fig 6 shows typical oct images before and after the detachment tests the detachment ratios were 18 13 for the base condition and 4 5 for the suppressed condition fig 5 the ts concentration was 2101 300 mgts mm2 for the base condition and 180 80 mgts mm2 for the suppressed condition the ts values before the detachment tests were negligible both void and detached ratio differences between the base and suppressed conditions were statistically significant t test p 0 05 3 3 effects of predation on the nitrifying community qpcr was used to determine the relative abundance of nob i e the amount of nob relative to nob aob for the base condition the relative abundance of nob was 0 2 0 1 while for the suppressed condition it was 3 6 2 0 fig 7 thus the relative abundance of nob was around an order of magnitude lower for the base condition for the suppressed condition see figure s4 in the si for a table of the absolute copy numbers for amoa and nxrb the fish analysis also showed that aob were more abundant than nob and that aob formed large cluster figure s5 in the si the relative abundance of nob i e nob aob nob was 9 6 for the base condition and 45 12 for the suppressed condition based on the data from fish images the trends are consistent with the qpcr results effects of predation on biofilm mechanical properties rheometry tests were conducted on the large flow cells to determine the biofilm mechanical properties fig 9 the storage modulus elastic behavior was 1650 853 pa for the base condition and 23 300 11 500 pa for the suppressed condition the loss modulus viscous behavior was 242 135 pa for the base condition and 3640 1860 pa for suppressed condition 4 discussion in this study the only difference between base and suppressed predation reactors was the abundance of protozoa fig 3 this suggests that the differences between the two were caused by predation 4 1 effects of predation on nitrification performance the ammonium removal flux was 0 84 0 02 and 1 42 0 13 gnh4 n m2day for the base and suppressed conditions respectively the lower flux for the base condition was probably due to its lower thickness which likely resulted from predation also the removal fluxes for both base and suppressed conditions were lower than reported for other mabr systems with silicone membranes augusto et al 2018 hsieh et al 2002 removal fluxes are affected by many factors such as the influent loading type of substrate air supply pressure and membrane materials the low flux in this study may be due to the passive air supply without pressurization which could have limited o2 concentrations within the biofilm the negative effects of predation on nitrification fluxes may be compensated by increasing the air pressure as this could increase the nitrification rates fenchel 2014 results also suggest that predation enhanced nitritation the result of fish and qpcr indicates that nob both nitrospira and nitrobacter were more affected by predation than aob conversion of nh4 to no2 and no3 for the base condition was 86 and 6 respectively on the other hand conversion of nh4 to no2 and no3 for the suppressed condition was 28 and 47 respectively this may be because the effects of predation on nob were greater than on aob fig 7 the result of this study showed that predation could affects the nitrifying community past studies on both heterotrophic and nitrifying microbial communities from both suspended and biofilms also found that predation affects bacterial abundance and diversity corno et al 2008 hahn et al 1999 hahn and hofle 2001 1999 jürgens and matz 2002 simek et al 1997 simek and kojecka 1999 suarez et al 2015 verhagen and laanbroek 1992 wey et al 2012 yu et al 2011 in this study the amount of biomass was compared by quantifying the average cross sectional area of biofilms where base and suppressed predation showed 0 5 0 1 and 0 9 0 3 mm2 respectively this result is similar to studies by rensink and rulkens 1997 where suppression of protozoa increased biomass production rates however other researchers found that predation had little influence on the nitrification performance in suspended growth systems lee and oleszkiewicz 2003 yu et al 2011 lee and welander 1994 found that the suppression of protozoa doubled nitrification rates but did not affect the biofilm thickness one possible reason for the unaltered thickness is because they added the prokaryotic inhibitor after the biofilm was fully grown whereas our study added cycloheximide since the initial biofilm formation 4 2 effects of predation on the internal structure of nitrifying biofilms past research on heterotrophic biofilms has shown that predation increased the amount of internal voids aybar et al 2019 for example for a heterotrophic mabr biofilm the internal void ratio was 6 7 when predation was suppressed compared to 50 16 when predation was not suppressed kim et al 2020 similarly the internal void ratio was 45 5 5 4 in another study on heterotrophic mabr biofilms where predation was noted aybar et al 2019 our study with nitrifying mabr biofilms showed similar results where the void ratio was 69 6 for base condition but only 54 4 for the suppressed condition interestingly the internal voids ratio of nitrifying biofilms 54 4 was greater than that of heterotrophic biofilms with suppressed predation i e 6 7 kim et al 2020 for both studies there was some effects of predation even with cyloheximide this is because cycloheximide as a eukaryote inhibitor did not completely inhibit protozoa the difference of the internal voids may be caused by the growth rate difference between heterotrophic and nitrifying bacteria in aybar et al 2019 there was an inverse relationship between the bacterial growth rates and the formation of internal voids when the concentration of substrate in the bulk was high i e a higher growth rate the internal voids ratio was low in our study the bulk ammonium concentration was not limiting for either condition however the inherently slow growth kinetics of nitrifying bacteria matsumoto et al 2007 picioreanu et al 2016 may have caused the higher internal void ratio in the suppressed condition 4 3 predation and microbial community in this study predation affected nob more than aob this dominance of aob over nob fig 7 could be explained by the different growth rates of aob and nob in this past research the effects of predation were related to the growth rate of their prey the formation of internal voids by predation was significantly reduced when the growth rate of bacteria was high with the high substrate condition aybar et al 2019 the maximum specific growth rate µmax of aob is greater than nob in most studies hunik et al 1994 munz et al 2011 picioreanu et al 2016 wiesmann 2005 but this difference is not enough to explain the dramatic reduction of nob in this study fig 8 2 the difference of the half saturation coefficient ks o2 between aob and nob is more significant than that of the maximum growth rate considering this study was carried out with unpressurized air i e o2 limiting conditions the growth conditions are more favorable for aob than for nob however the smaller value of the half saturation coefficient ks substrate of nob contradicts the higher growth rate of aob this effect can be compensated by that the concentration of nh4 is much higher than that of no2 in bulk liquid also the result of predation is the mineralization of organic nitrogen to nh4 bloem et al 1988 kuikman et al 1991 which gives an additional benefit to aob another possible explanation for the dominance of aob over nob fig 7 is the different size of cell clusters protozoa shows size selective grazing because of morphological limitations jürgens and matz 2002 matz et al 2002 specifically the larger size of cells or cell clusters shows the greater resistance to grazing pernthaler et al 1996 previous research has shown the size of aob clusters was greater than that of nob manser et al 2005 picioreanu et al 2016 suggesting the greater effects of predation on nob than aob a similar result was shown in fish analysis of this study the average cell cluster size for aob 10 μ m was larger than that of nob 1 μ m see figure s5 in the si which provides fish images showing cluster sizes of aob and nob in four different samples 4 4 mechanical properties in our studies the base condition with predation had more voids fig 5 greater detachment fig 5 and weaker mechanical properties than the suppressed condition fig 9 a positive correlation between internal voids detachment and mechanical properties was previously shown for heterotrophic mabr biofilms kim et al 2020 however the absolute value of viscous i e loss modulus and elastic i e storage modulus properties were quite different the loss modulus 3640 1860 pa and storage modulus 23 300 11 500 pa of nitrifying mabr biofilms for suppressed condition were higher than the loss modulus 1580 729 pa and storage modulus 9800 4290 pa of heterotrophic mabr biofilms for conditions with suppressed predation this may result from the difference in strength between nitrifying and heterotrophic biofilms past researches show that slow growing biofilms are more resistant to sloughing pellicer nàcher and smets 2014 picioreanu et al 2000 tijhuis et al 1995 van loosdrecht et al 1995 heterotrophic biofilms often grow fast resulting in low density irregular protuberances that are more susceptible to detachment or sloughing on the other hand in slow growing nitrifying biofilms the low density protuberances either are not formed or are readily removed by shear in bulk leaving dense basal part the comparison of detachment between nitrifying and heterotrophic biofilms for suppressed condition also shows heterotrophic biofilms are more susceptible to sloughing than nitrifying biofilms where the detachment ratios of nitrifying and heterotrophic biofilms were 4 5 this study and 7 9 kim et al 2020 respectively this study shows that predation can decrease the inherent differences in mechanical properties between heterotrophic and nitrifying mabr biofilms for the base condition the loss modulus 242 135 pa and storage modulus 1650 853 pa of nitrifying biofilms was similar to the loss 363 189 pa modulus and storage modulus 1780 1180 pa of heterotrophic biofilms this is because predation affects the dense basal layer near the membrane in our study effects of predation were mainly seen near the membrane fig 6 where the concentration of oxygen was maximum but the concentration of substrate was minimum in this condition the predation rate can surpass the growth rate of bacteria resulting in increase of internal voids aybar et al 2019 since the bottom layer was compromised by voids in nitrifying biofilms as well sloughing occurred for the base condition the detachment ratios of the nitrifying and heterotrophic mabr biofilms were 18 13 this study and 44 24 kim et al 2020 respectively a possible reason for the higher detachment ratio for heterotrophic mabr biofilms may be that they were affected by both erosion on the low density protuberances near the bulk and sloughing on basal layer near membrane it could also be caused by the different shear stresses during the detachment due to the different roughness data is not shown and average thickness of nitrifying 150 µm this study and heterotrophic mabr biofilms 200 µm kim et al 2020 this result suggests the relationship between detachment and mechanical properties is not linear it means the direct estimate of detachment through the value of mechanical properties should be combined with many other factors such as internal voids bacterial community and the composition of eps 5 conclusion the major findings of this research are predation can reduce nitrification removal fluxes probably due to biomass loss the production of internal voids by predation is significant in nitrifying mabr biofilms predation weakens the mechanical properties of nitrifying biofilms which can increase biofilm detachment predation affects nob more than aob in nitrifying biofilms these results show that predation affects biomass accumulation bacterial community structure mechanical strength and reactor performance for nitrifying mabr biofilms an in depth understanding of predation is critical to control those effects further research should address the kinetics of predation in biofilms currently effects of predation are often lumped into the detachment or decay coefficients of biofilms this approach does not accurately assess the effects of predation in biofilms also while traditional monod kinetics has been used to estimate the kinetics of protozoa this has not been confirmed experimentally an improved kinetic model for protozoan growth can help understand and better manage the phenomenon of predation in biofilms declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

16413,livestock production is often a source of multiple pollutants in rivers however current assessments of water pollution seldomly take a multi pollutant perspective while this is essential for improving water quality this study quantifies inputs of multiple pollutants to rivers from livestock production worldwide by animal types and spatially explicit we focus on nitrogen n phosphorus p and cryptosporidium pathogen we developed the marina global l model to assess river inputs of pollutants to seas for livetsock model for 10 226 sub basins and eleven livestock species global inputs to

pollute rivers with multiple substances including nitrogen n phosphorus p and pathogens e g cryptosporidium livestock provides manure for crop production manure contains nutrients e g n p but often also pathogens such as oocysts of cryptosporidium these nutrients and oocysts can enter rivers through surface runoff from fertilized crop fields or direct discharges of manure only for chinese rivers strokal et al 2019 vermeulen et al 2019 with the population growth and changing diets livestock production will increase to satisfy the global food demand herrero et al 2016 ilea 2009 this may increase levels of multiple pollutants in rivers from livestock production in the future currently around two billion people in the world use contaminated water who 2019 in many countries rivers contain nutrients strokal et al 2019 and pathogens such as cryptosporidium vermeulen et al 2019 excess nutrients cause eutrophication problems in many lakes reservoirs and coastal waters breitburg et al 2018 strokal et al 2021a strokal and kroeze 2020 for instance 78 of the coastal waters of the united states suffer from eutrophication malone and newton 2020 leading to harmful algae blooms hypoxia less oxygen and loss of aquatic biodiversity gobler et al 2017 howard et al 2017 malone and newton 2020 cryptosporidium is a protozoan parasite and can be found in infected human and animal feces vermeulen et al 2017 robertson et al 2014 cryptosporidium contamination occurs in many countries across the world bautista et al 2018 krumkamp et al 2020 for instance oocysts have been detected in surface and groundwater for domestic water use in haiti balthazard accou et al 2020 this situation leads to water borne diarrhea that threatens public health especially for young children krumkamp et al 2020 vermeulen et al 2019 current assessments of water pollution from livestock production hardly take a multi pollutant perspective existing studies focus either on nutrients beusen et al 2015 or pathogens vermeulen et al 2019 but not on both simultaneously we observe two important knowledge gaps first the contribution of individual livestock species to river pollution with multiple pollutants is not well studied especially for sub basins in the world second there is a need for multi pollutant assessments to evaluate effective pollution reduction options li et al 2019 reducing one pollutant from livestock may decrease synergy or increase trade off other pollutants in rivers a multi pollutant assessments can help to account for synergies and trade offs between pollutants in water pollution control and support the achievement of sustainable development goals sdg 6 clean water and sanitation and sdg 2 food security mehrabi et al 2020 existing global models quantify flows of pollutants from land to rivers and focus largely on single groups of pollutants beusen et al 2015 vermeulen et al 2017 wang et al 2020 the glowpa crypto c1 global waterborne pathogen crypto sporidium concentration model quantifies oocyst concentrations in rivers from livestock and humans at 0 5 grid cell vermeulen et al 2019 marina model to assess river inputs of pollutants to seas is another model for river pollution strokal et al 2016 the first version of the marina model was developed for china to quantify river export of nutrients at the sub basin scale strokal et al 2016 marina has been updated with more pollutants and expanded to 10 226 sub basins worldwide resulting in a global version marina global strokal et al 2021a the marina global model includes nutrients and oocysts and integrates the approach of the glowpa crypto model for human waste strokal et al 2019 strokal et al 2021a marina global does not yet model pollutants from livestock and does not distinguish the contribution of individual livestock species to river pollution moreover a spatially and temporally consistent dataset for over ten thousand sub basins and multiple pollutants in rivers from livestock production is still lacking this study aims to quantify inputs of multiple pollutants to rivers from livestock production worldwide by animal types and spatially explicit we focus on din dissolved inorganic nitrogen dip dissolved inorganic phosphorus don dissolved organic nitrogen dop dissolved organic phosphorus and oocysts from cryptosporidium 2 material and methods 2 1 marina global l model we develop the marina global l model model to assess river inputs of pollutnts to sea for livestock fig 1 it quantifies annual inputs of nutrients and oocysts to rivers from individual livestock species in 10 226 sub basins for 2010 this number of sub basins is larger than in earlier studies for example mayorga et al 2010 focused on around 6000 basins in our study large basins are split into sub basins details are in strokal et al 2021a in total it results in 10 226 sub basins in the world oocysts of cryptosporidium in our marina global l model are examples of pathogens marina global l is based on the existing marina global model strokal et al 2021a but integrates the three modeling approaches for livestock the glowpa crypto l1 global waterborne pathogen crypto sporidium from livestock and glowpa crypto c1 model global waterborne pathogen crypto sporidium concentration for oocysts vermeulen et al 2017 2019 and the marina modeling approach of chen et al resubmission for nutrients the marina global model and glowpa models are described in supplementary text 1 and text 2 the marina global l model accounts for eleven livestock species following the glowpa crypto l1 model vermeulen et al 2017 these are buffaloes camels cattle chickens ducks donkeys goats horses mules pigs and sheep the model distinguishes the two main systems of livestock manure management grazing and storage in the grazing systems animals drop their manure directly on land in the storage systems manure is collected and stored before application on land we account for losses of nutrients and oocysts during storage before manure application these are for example denitrification of n and decay of oocysts during manure storage strokal et al 2016 vermeulen et al 2017 we account for removals and losses in soils as a function of runoff generally the model distinguishes between losses to rivers via surface runoff from soils after manure application and point direct discharges of manure to rivers sources of nutrients and oocysts in rivers from livestock production direct discharges of manure to rivers are only the point source for chinese rivers strokal et al 2016 chadwick et al 2015 the model considers the crop livestock relation the model includes the application of synthetic fertilizers and animal manure on land in calculating inputs of manure relevant pollutants from land to rivers the main model inputs include livestock numbers the excretion rates of cryptosporidium and nutrients the prevalence of cryptosporidiosis manure production per animal manure management and runoff fig 1 details in tables s1 s7 figs s1 s4 most of the model inputs for calculating manure associated nutrients and oocysts on land are derived from the glowpa crypto l1 model vermeulen et al 2017 collected data from various sources bouwman et al 2013 robinson et al 2014 ipcc 2006 safley et al 1992 weedon et al 2011 therefore here we take the data for oocysts from vermeulen et al 2017 at 0 5 grid or country scales details in fig s1 in addition some model inputs such as n and p excretion rates fractions of n volatilization and direct discharges of manure are from literature bouwman et al 1997 bouwman and van der hoek 1997 2017 ipcc 2006 sheldrick et al 2003 smith 1991 and nufer nutrient flows in food chains environment and resources use datasets at a country scale ma et al 2012 nutrient inputs to cropland from the application of synthetic fertilizers atmospheric n deposition and biological n fixation are derived from the updated image gnm integrated model to assess the global environment global nutrient model model beusen et al 2015 for cryptosporidium the glowpa crypto c1 model provided model inputs such as runoff fractions for oocysts and their decay vermeulen et al 2019 we process country or grid model inputs to sub basins as table s4 describes the final model outputs are annual inputs of din dip don dop and cryptosporidium as oocysts to rivers eqs 1 5 fig 1 these outputs are by sub basin eleven livestock species grazing and storage systems and by point and diffuse sources figs 2 6 calculations are done in two steps fig 1 first inputs of the pollutants to land are calculated from animal manure n p and oocysts eq 1 this is done as a function of manure management livestock number and removal during storage systems for nutrients inputs of total n and p to land are calculated second inputs of the pollutants to rivers are calculated as a function of inputs to land corrected for crop uptake n and p and soil associated retention rates for n p and oocysts eqs 2 5 soil associated retentions reflect the removal of pollutants during export from land to rivers this includes for instance oocysts decay and n denitrification for nutrients inputs of dissolved inorganic and organic n and p to rivers are calculated the sum of inorganic and organic forms equals to the total dissolved n tdn and total dissolved p tdp for n and p we accounted for crop production receiving nutrients from not only manure but also from synthetic fertilizers atmospheric n deposition and biological n fixation eq 3 we corrected the amount of n and p in soils for crop uptake g p j

model evaluation is presented in section 4 1 2 2 defining pollution hotspots we define pollution hotspots for the inputs of nutrients and oocysts to land and rivers inspired by the approach of wang et al 2018 we first rank the inputs of nutrients and oocysts to land and rivers per km2 of sub basin area from the lowest to the highest values from level i lowest to level iv highest level iv includes the highest values top 10 most polluted sub basins the other three levels reflect the lower values the ranges to some extent arbitrary are described below for inputs to land levels i ii and iii have the following ranges for level i inputs of n to land range from 0 to 200 kg km2 yr this is from 0 to 10 kg km2 yr for p and from 0 to 1 3 1013 oocysts km2 yr for cryptosporidium ranges of level ii are as follows 200 750 kg km2 yr for n 10 88 kg km2 yr for p and 1 3 1013 2 1013 oocysts km2 yr for cryptosporidium ranges of level iii are as follow 750 1151 kg km2 yr for n 88 257 kg km2 yr for p and 2 1013 3 73 1013 oocysts km2 yr for cryptosporidium for inputs to rivers levels i ii and iii have the following ranges for level i inputs of tdn to rivers range from 0 to 30 kg km2 yr this is from 0 to 1 kg km2 yr for tdp and from 0 to 0 4 1013 oocysts km2 yr for cryptosporidium ranges of level ii are 30 150 kg km2 yr for tdn 1 3 kg km2 yr for tdp and 0 4 1013 0 8 1013 oocysts km2 yr for cryptosporidium for level iii the ranges are 150 234 kg km2 yr for tdn 3 8 1 kg km2 yr for tdp and 0 8 1013 1 6 1013oocysts km2 yr for cryptosporidium level iv is considered a pollution hotspot level iv has sub basins in the top 10 with the highest inputs of nutrients and oocysts on land and in rivers we also define multi pollutant hotspots for this sub basins are further classified based on the number of pollutants for which the inputs of at least two of the pollutants to land or rivers are in the top highest 10 under level iv 3 results 3 1 nutrients and oocysts on land from livestock globally 123 tg n 23 tg p and 1 0 1022 oocysts are excreted in livestock manure in 2010 fig s4 not all of this reaches the land some may be retained in storage or lost to water or air as a net effect 94 tg n 19 tg p and 2 9 1021 oocysts are applied on land fig s5 globally grazing systems contribute 58 of p 63 of n and 64 of oocysts to land fig 2 the share of the grazing and storage systems in manure inputs to land differ among continents fig 2 in many continents the grazing systems are dominant contributors to n p and oocysts on land this is different in europe p oocysts north america n p oocysts and asia n and p where more than half of manure inputs to land are from storage systems fig 2 and largely from chickens ducks and pigs fig s5 asia south america and africa are responsible for over 68 of global n p and oocysts on land in 2010 fig 3 for example livestock in these three continents contributes 70 tg n 13 tg p and 2 0 1021 oocysts on land fig 3 the largest share is for asia this is largely associated with a large number of animals in this continent fig s3 table s8 the contribution of europe is 12 12 and 18 to global inputs of n p and oocysts to land respectively fig 4 this contribution is smaller than the contribution of asia because the livestock numbers in asia are five times higher than that in europe fig s3 table s8 inputs of n p and oocysts to land differ largely among sub basins fig 3 hotspots of n p and oocysts on land are mainly concentrated in sub basins in europe india the middle parts of africa and south america and the eastern part of china fig 3 for example many sub basins in europe asia north and south america receive more n p and oocysts 1151 kgn km2 257 kgp km2 and 3 73 1013 oocysts km2 yr than other sub basins in 2010 this also holds for some sub basins in africa fig 3 as a result 1302 sub basins can be considered as pollution hotspots of nutrients and oocysts with inputs of n p and oocysts to land exceeding 1151 kg n km2 257 kg p km2 and 3 73 1013 oocyst km2 level iv 12 of the global sub basin areas 1 6 107 km2 is highly polluted by three types of substances simultaneously almost all sub basins in europe are influenced by three types of substances in addition the main chinese sub basins contribute a considerable amount 4 4 tg yr for n 1 tg yr for p and 1 1020 oocysts yr for cryptosporidium to the global inputs of nutrients and oocysts to land as a result of intensive livestock production and direct discharge of manure to rivers cattle production is an important contributor to inputs of n p and oocysts to land in many sub basins and continents fig 3 and 4 in sub basins that we consider pollution hotspots the share of cattle production in the inputs of n p and oocysts per km2 ranges from 33 to 90 depending on sub basins and substance fig 3 for the european sub basin hotspots the contribution of pig production to oocysts on land is larger 57 than the contribution of the cattle 30 and chicken 11 production for the north american sub basin hotspots mainly in the mississippi river basin the contribution of pig manure to oocysts on land is larger 35 than the contribution of cattle 33 and chicken manure 27 fig 3 on a continental scale fig 4 the contribution of cattle manure is also larger compared to the other livestock this holds for most continents and substances chicken production plays an important role in continents such as asia north america and south america mainly for p and oocysts pig production is important in asia for n and p europe for n p and oocysts and north america for oocysts fig 4 3 2 nutrients and oocysts in rivers from livestock approximately 22 tg tdn 1 8 tg tdp and 1 3 1021 oocysts enter rivers in 2010 around 20 tg n enter rivers as din and 2 tg n enter rivers as don for p this is 1 3 tg for dip and 0 5 tg for dop fig s4 however there is a large spatial variability in river pollution among continents fig 5 at the continental scale the majority of nutrients and oocysts input to rivers are calculated for asia and south america europe also accounts for large amounts of tdn and oocysts in rivers this can be explained by the spatial variability in livestock production and manure management fig 3 table s4 sub basins with river inputs exceeding 234 kg n km2 yr 8 1 kg p km2 yr and 1 6 1013 oocysts km2 yr are considered as pollution hotspots level iv one fourth of the sub basin areas 1592 sub basins are identified as river pollution hotspots with nutrients and cryptosporidium these pollution hotspots are responsible for 82 of tdn 95 of tdp and 71 of oocysts inputs to rivers globally fig 5 these hotspots are mainly found in asia europe and south america fig 5 cattle pigs and chickens are responsible for 74 88 of nutrients and oocysts in rivers in 2010 globally fig 6 cattle production takes the largest share in global river pollution which is similar on land fig 6 section 3 1 global inputs to rivers from cattle production are 12 tg of din 0 6 tg of don 0 5 tg of dip 0 1 tg of dop and 6 4 1020 oocysts in 2010 fig s6 the substances from livestock species enter rivers via diffuse and point sources chadwick et al 2015 strokal et al 2016 wang et al 2020 the share of diffuse and point sources in river pollution differs among the eleven types of livestock species fig 6 globally the share of diffuse sources surface runoff in river pollution from cattle production ranges from 51 to 63 depending on pollutants fig 6 it is much higher than the contribution from other livestock species however point sources of cattle production account for 15 25 of river pollution globally fig 6 this means that compared to other livestock species diffuse sources of cattle production are more important for river pollution than point sources this is different for pigs and chickens where point sources of manure play an important role compared to other livestock species globally for example pig production accounts for 21 of oocysts 25 of tdp and 38 of tdn in rivers globally from point sources fig 5 point sources from chicken production account for 8 of tdn 32 of tdp and 58 of oocysts in rivers globally point sources are particularly important for the sub basins in china 4 discussion 4 1 model uncertainties and comparisons our model integrates the glowpa and marina modeling approaches that were previously evaluated strokal et al 2021a strokal et al 2016 2019 vermeulen et al 2017 2019 the glowpa models have been validated using available observations for a set of rivers for cryptosporidium vermeulen et al 2017 for nutrients our model builds on the family of the marina models that were evaluated globally nationally and seasonally in several earlier studies x chen et al 2019a 2019b wang et al 2020 strokal et al 2016 yang et al 2019 goshu et al 2020 strokal et al 2021a e g r2 0 90 for the yangtze basin r2 0 84 for china we further evaluate our model using the building trust approach strokal 2016 strokal et al 2021a wang et al 2020 this includes comparisons with other studies sensitivity analyses and discussion of limitations and uncertainties comparisons of model inputs with other studies model inputs are for instance manure excretion and inputs of pollutants to land see section 2 our model inputs are generally in line with other studies supplementary table s11 16 supplementary text 4 globally our manure excretion is within the range of 80 130 tg n from the other studies bai et al 2016 bouwman et al 2013 fao 2018 sheldrick et al 2003 our total inputs of n and p on land coincide with other studies 91 92 tg n 17 tg p beusen et al 2015 bodirsky et al 2012 our manure excretion for p for 2010 23 tg is somewhat higher than an earlier estimate for 2000 17 tg of p bouwman et al 2013 one of the reasons could be that between 2000 and 2010 livestock production has increased this increase is estimated at around 20 globally faostat 2021 another reason could be the difference in the methods and scales details see supplementary text 4 we also compare n excretions with fao datasets food and agriculture organization of the united states for individual species table s12 our result is in line with fao datasets for the whole of china we calculate the manure excretion of 24 tg n and 4 5 tg p which is comparable to the study of bai et al 2016 for n 23 tg n and slightly lower for p 5 2 tg p because of different datasets and calculation methods table s13 supplementary text 4 spatial variabilities in manure excretion are generally in line with existing studies potter et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 potter et al 2010 presented the total manure production at 0 5 grids they focused on nutrients and did not distinguish the contribution of individual livestock species we do this for nutrients and oocysts at the sub basins scale zhang et al 2017 estimated n excretion from multiple livestock species at 5 arcmin grids our study and zhang et al 2017 indicate the large share of cattle pigs and chickens in the total n excretion comparisons of model outputs with other studies our model outputs are inputs of pollutants to rivers from manure we also compare model outputs with other models and are able to explain most of the difference in particular we compare inputs of different n and p forms in rivers with global news tables s17 the global news global nutrient export from watersheds model model calculates inputs of dissolved and organic forms of n and p to rivers from manure mayorga et al 2010 globally our model calculated 22 tg of tdn and 1 8 tg of tdp to rivers from manure in 2010 these estimates are higher than that in the global news model table s17 this also holds for our estimates of din don dip and dop to rivers table s17 the reasons are the differences in time space model inputs and modeling approaches between our model and global news for example we calculate river pollution for 2010 and global news for 2000 our model is based on a sub basin scale modeling approach and global news is based on a basin scale modeling approach the other reason is that we consider direct discharges of manure to chinese rivers which is ignored in global news spatial variabilities in river pollution hotspots are comparable with other studies wang et al 2020 van vliet et al 2019 mayorga et al 2010 vermeulen et al 2019 for example our river pollution hotspots in many sub basins of asia south america and africa coincide with existing studies mayorga et al 2010 vermeulen et al 2019 comparing to studies for nutrients less data or models are available for pathogen generally our model outputs for cryptosporidium in rivers are comparable with few existing studies atwill et al 2006 starkey et al 2007 our pollution hotspots of cryptosporidium match the pollution hotspots of other microorganisms hofstra et al 2019 reder et al 2015 it should be noted that observed values of oocysts in rivers are relatively uncertain in our study we focus on both nutrients and oocysts simultaneously which is not done in existing studies generally river pollution hotspots fig 5 are calculated for sub basins that also receive high manure inputs fig 3 this is in line with other studies e g beusen et al 2015 mayorga et al 2010 bouwman et al 2009 studies show that areas with higher runoff generally receive more pollutants yang and toor 2018 chen et al 2018 which is also shown in our study for sub basins examples are sub basins located in india south america and the south parts of china where the climate is relatively wet with more runoff compared to the north china plain with relatively dry climate zhang and wang 2021 in addition n is more mobile in soils than p strokal and de vries 2012 thus more n from land reaches rivers compared to p which is in line with our study oocysts can decay in soils vermeulen et al 2017 thus not all oocysts on land can reach rivers in our model we account for those factors when calculating inputs to rivers section 2 sensitivity analysis we test the sensitivity of the model outputs to changes in model inputs we ran our model with manure application from the updated image gnm model for n and p beusen et al 2015 results of this ran are comparable with our original model ran for the river pollution with nutrients and their spatial variabilities figs s7 s8 for cryptosporidium we ran the model with manure application from the glowpa crypto l1 model and the results are also comparable with our original model ran figs s7 s8 furthermore we compare two methods to aggregate model inputs we refer to the method used in our model as method 1 method 2 is an alternative that we use here for the sensitivity analysis in method 1 several model inputs e g fractions of grazing systems are aggregated from country or grids of 0 5 to sub basins based on livestock population density details in figs s7 s8 tables s4 s9 s10 this method is transparent but may introduce uncertainties in model outputs thus we use method 2 to test the sensitivity of model outputs to aggregation methods in method 2 we aggregate some of the model inputs from country or grids of 0 5 by averaging gridded values over the corresponding sub basins details in tables s4 s9 s10 we compare model outputs between these two aggregations methods tables s9 s10 this sensitivity analysis confirms that model outputs and our main conclusions are not largely affected by the processing methods of model inputs tables s9 s10 reflection on model uncertainties as any integrated models our model has uncertainties nevertheless we consider our model appropriate for large scale analyses based on the comparisons with observations independent datasets and other models as well as the sensitivity analysis see above model uncertainties are also associated with the modeling approach at the sub basin scale several models e g glowpa image gnm quantify pollution at the 0 5 grid scale vermeulen et al 2017 vermeulen et al 2019 beusen et al 2015 other models do this on the basin scale e g global news mayorga et al 2010 our model is in between these two scales we focus on sub basins not too course basin and not too detailed grid the choice for the sub basin scale modeling is justified by the research aim indeed some datasets are at grids e g livestock numbers however others are national or even regional e g manure management treatments we aggregate datasets into the sub basins and make datasets consistent for nutrients and oocysts see our supporting information for details we believe that all scales grids basins sub basins have pros and cons we consider sub basins appropriate in our study considering the availability and uncertainties of the datasets at different scales we apply a lumped modeling approach to calculate inputs of pollutants from land to rivers as a function of runoff in this approach processes for losses of pollutants in soils e g denitrification decay of oocysts are modeled at the sub basin scale other studies modeled nutrients or cryptosporidium for full basins mayorga et al 2010 or 0 5 grids beusen et al 2015 vermeulen et al 2019 our sub basin scale approach is based on successful earlier model applications strokal et al 2021a strokal et al 2016 wang et al 2020 chen et al 2019a 2019b we improve these earlier studies by harmonizing the model inputs for nutrients and oocysts to the same spatial and temporal level of detail we use a process based approach to calculate export fractions of nutrients from land to rivers in sub basins tables s4 s5 thus our model does not rely on parameters that were calibrated using a limited set of observations for a certain year or period reflection on limitations our modeling approach focuses on dissolved nutrients and surface waters rivers we do not account for particulates implying that our pollution levels might be underestimated an important reason is that we focus on dissolved nutrient forms in surface waters that result from manure in livestock production particulate nutrients are mainly in rivers from erosion processes beusen et al 2005 on the other hand we show the impact of livestock production on surface water pollution which is the main objective of this study in addition existing studies point out the importance of vadose zone interflow and groundwater in water pollution assessments for example hartmann et al 2021 pointed out that up to 50 of infiltrating pollutants may enter groundwater through rapid transport pathways some studies indicate that nutrients and oocysts can transport to groundwater through deep percolation khan et al 2018 balthazard accou et al 2020 gu et al 2013 therefore the next steps would be to add erosion and explore approaches to account for multiple pollutants in groundwater in our study we account for interactions between nutrients and oocysts at the source site for example manure is a common source of both nutrients and pathogens on land and in rivers runoff is the common pathway of these pollutants to reach rivers however our model does not account for biogeochemical interactions between nutrients and oocysts in rivers the knowledge in this field is very limited for large scale water quality modeling a few studies addressed interactions tamis et al 2021 kong et al 2019 but were limited to data and scale more research is needed to better understand interactions between nutrients and pathogens in river systems our results are for the year 2010 which is about 10 years from now we may under or overestimate pollution levels in sub basins for today however we believe that our conclusions are still relevant we showed the pollution hotspots as the priority areas for effective manure management we believe that the locations of those hotspots did not change much between 2010 and today this is because those places remain densely populated with intensive livestock production e g asian sub basins another conclusion is the importance of manure as the common source of multiple pollutants in rivers we also believe that this conclusion is highly relevant today we show the large contribution of pigs cattle and chickens to river pollution today these animals remain important producers of meat for human consumption faostat 2021 this implies that managing the manure of these species is still relevant for reducing future river pollution by multiple pollutants moreover we present our results on the global e g fig 6 continental fig 4 and sub basin scales e g fig 5 thus our insights are relevant for water management at those scales for management at local scales such as farms our model needs further validation all of the above builds trust in our model results for large scale analyses we argue that the inevitable uncertainties in the model inputs and approach do not largely affect our main conclusions however for local analyses of livestock impacts on multi pollutant problems e g within sub basins villages our model needs to be further evaluated and validated 4 2 livestock management to reduce river pollution our study provides four insights for livestock management first we show the priority areas sub basins for pollution reduction in the world fig 5 sub baisns allow us to account for the spatial variability especially within the large basins e g mississippi yangtze nile danube amazon many studies confirms that water pollution is a worldwide problem for instance nutrient cycling and associated pollution are global phenomena nutrient induced eutrophication is found in many surface water such as rivers estuaries and lakes lapointe et al 2017 wynne and stumpf 2015 lehman et al 2015 isaacs et al 2014 strokal et al 2016 mayorga et al 2010 pathogen pollution is also a problem in many developing countries posing health risks bouzid et al 2018 this is a result of livestock production and insufficient manure management leading to high inputs of pollutants to land and thus to rivers figs 3 and 5 global change may influence the intensity of livestock production and runoff causing pollution in the coming years herrero et al 2016 ilea 2009 impacts of global change have to be considered in formulating effective management options to reduce pollution hotspots second our study can help to identify the contributions of livestock systems to river pollution we show that grazing systems dominate in some regions e g oceania africa and storage systems in others e g europe north america this indicates where and what efforts are needed to reduce manure related river pollution for example reducing pollutants to rivers from grazing systems is needed in africa reducing pollutants to rivers from storage systems is needed in europe this means that effective manure management is important for both systems to avoid future river pollution globally third we provide a better understanding of the contribution of livestock species to river pollution taking a multi pollutant perspective this was not done before for river sub basins and n p and oocysts simultaneously our study can be considered an urgent call for better manure management in the production of pigs cattle and chickens globally figs 3 and 6 this differs among sub basins for example for asian sub basins river pollution reduction is needed from the production of pigs sheep cattle and chickens this information could be used to define sub basin specific strategies to manage manure effectively examples of such technologies are livestock feed management ershadi et al 2020 dietary guidelines health canada 2019 caro et al 2017 or livestock specific policies fourth our study indicates the dominant water pollution sources diffuse and point source for multiple pollutants diffuse sources are most important globally and point sources are important for china to our knowledge this is also the first attempt to quantify the impact of livestock production on multiple pollutants in rivers by source from individual livestock species for sub basins simultaneously for example existing studies also showed the importance of point sources for chinese rivers chadwick et al 2015 strokal et al 2016 but mainly for nutrients we take a multi pollutant approach and focus on nutrients and oocysts furthermore existing studies show the importance of diffuse sources but only for individual pollution types tang et al 2011 van vliet et al 2019 our model could be used for scenario analysis to explore the synergetic actions for reducing multiple pollutants in rivers in the future our model could also be used to analyze the impact of upstream activities on downstream water pollution 4 3 implications for the achievement of sustainable development goals sustainable livestock production supports sustainable development goal sdg 2 on food security and sdg 6 on clean water and sanitation mehrabi et al 2020 sakadevan and nguyen 2017 tilman and clark 2014 improving livestock production and its manure management sdg 2 could potentially reduce river pollution with nutrients and oocysts sdg 6 mehrabi et al 2020 strokal et al 2021a this is a synergetic effect between sdgs 2 and 6 our results indicate where sub basins and what sources point or diffuse we need to focus on in livestock production sdg 2 to reduce river pollution sdg 6 this information could support the formulation of effective management options for livestock production that can account for synergies between sdg 2 and sdg 6 and mitigate their trade offs e g more manure may lead to more multiple pollutants in rivers synergetic solutions are needed to mitigate multi pollutant problems in many rivers worldwide effects of policies on river pollution have been explored in existing studies for many world regions yasin et al 2010 eu commission 2019 lnv 2018 china plays an important role in reducing global river pollution from livestock production the chinese government promotes the agriculture green development agd with high agricultural production and low environmental impacts shen et al 2020 agd facilitates the implementation of environmental policies for instance non livestock production regions and pig relocation policies have been introduced to controlling surface water pollution bai et al 2019 the water pollution preventions and control plan have also been introduced to avoid pollution central people s government of the people s republic of china 2015 agd can serve as an example for other regions this is because agd combines efforts in integrating knowledge of crop animal food processing and environmental aspects for effective solutions strokal et al 2021b models have been used to quantify the effects of those policies on reducing nutrient pollution in rivers in the future wang et al 2020 agd highly supports the sdg and can be used for other countries as inspiration towards sustainable agriculture our model can be used to explore the effects of the agd policies on river pollution in china and elsewhere 5 conclusions this study quantified inputs of n p and oocysts from cryptosporidium to rivers from livestock production by animal types and in a spatially explicit way to this end we developed and applied the marina global l model to 10 226 sub basins for nutrients and oocysts results showed that around 94 tg n 19 tg p and 2 9 1021 oocysts were applied on land from livestock production in 2010 over 57 of nutrients and oocysts were from the grazed animal systems asia south america and africa were responsible for over 68 of these pollutants on land we calculated that around 22 tg tdn 1 8 tg tdp and 1 3 1021 oocysts entered rivers in 2010 one fourth of the sub basin area was responsible for 71 95 of nutrients and oocysts in rivers cattle pigs and chickens contributed by 74 88 to manure related inputs of nutrients and oocysts in rivers

16413,livestock production is often a source of multiple pollutants in rivers however current assessments of water pollution seldomly take a multi pollutant perspective while this is essential for improving water quality this study quantifies inputs of multiple pollutants to rivers from livestock production worldwide by animal types and spatially explicit we focus on nitrogen n phosphorus p and cryptosporidium pathogen we developed the marina global l model to assess river inputs of pollutants to seas for livetsock model for 10 226 sub basins and eleven livestock species global inputs to land from livestock are around 94 tg n 19 tg p and 2 9 1021 oocysts from cryptosporidium in 2010 over 57 of these amounts are from grazed animals asia south america and africa account for over 68 of these amounts on land the inputs to rivers are around 22 tg total dissolved nitrogen tdn 1 8 tg total dissolved p tdp and 1 3 1021 oocysts in 2010 cattle pigs and chickens are responsible for 74 88 of these pollutants in rivers one fourth of the global sub basins can be considered pollution hotspots and contribute 71 95 to the tdn tdp and oocysts in rivers our study could contribute to effective manure management for individual livestock species in sub basins to reduce multiple pollutants in rivers graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords marina global l model sub basin livestock

pollute rivers with multiple substances including nitrogen n phosphorus p and pathogens e g cryptosporidium livestock provides manure for crop production manure contains nutrients e g n p but often also pathogens such as oocysts of cryptosporidium these nutrients and oocysts can enter rivers through surface runoff from fertilized crop fields or direct discharges of manure only for chinese rivers strokal et al 2019 vermeulen et al 2019 with the population growth and changing diets livestock production will increase to satisfy the global food demand herrero et al 2016 ilea 2009 this may increase levels of multiple pollutants in rivers from livestock production in the future currently around two billion people in the world use contaminated water who 2019 in many countries rivers contain nutrients strokal et al 2019 and pathogens such as cryptosporidium vermeulen et al 2019 excess nutrients cause eutrophication problems in many lakes reservoirs and coastal waters breitburg et al 2018 strokal et al 2021a strokal and kroeze 2020 for instance 78 of the coastal waters of the united states suffer from eutrophication malone and newton 2020 leading to harmful algae blooms hypoxia less oxygen and loss of aquatic biodiversity gobler et al 2017 howard et al 2017 malone and newton 2020 cryptosporidium is a protozoan parasite and can be found in infected human and animal feces vermeulen et al 2017 robertson et al 2014 cryptosporidium contamination occurs in many countries across the world bautista et al 2018 krumkamp et al 2020 for instance oocysts have been detected in

al 2020 vermeulen et al 2019 current assessments of water pollution from livestock production hardly take a multi pollutant perspective existing studies focus either on nutrients beusen et al 2015 or pathogens vermeulen et al 2019 but not on both simultaneously we observe two important knowledge gaps first the contribution of individual livestock species to river pollution with multiple pollutants is not well studied especially for sub basins in the world second there is a need for multi pollutant assessments to evaluate effective pollution reduction options li et al 2019 reducing one pollutant from livestock may decrease synergy or increase trade off other pollutants in rivers a multi pollutant assessments can help to account for synergies and trade offs between pollutants in water pollution control and support the achievement of sustainable development goals sdg 6 clean water and sanitation and sdg 2 food security mehrabi et al 2020 existing global models quantify flows of

concentration model quantifies oocyst concentrations in rivers from livestock and humans at 0 5 grid cell vermeulen et al 2019 marina model to assess river inputs of pollutants to seas is another model for river pollution strokal et al 2016 the first version of the marina model was developed for china to quantify river export of nutrients at the sub basin scale strokal et al 2016 marina has been updated with more pollutants and expanded to 10 226 sub basins worldwide resulting in a global version marina global strokal et al 2021a the marina global model includes nutrients and oocysts and integrates the approach of the glowpa crypto model for human waste strokal et al 2019 strokal et al 2021a marina global does not yet model pollutants from livestock and does not distinguish the contribution of individual livestock species to river pollution moreover a spatially and temporally consistent dataset for over ten thousand sub basins and multiple pollutants in rivers from livestock production is still lacking this study aims to quantify inputs of multiple pollutants to rivers from livestock production worldwide by animal types and spatially explicit we focus on din dissolved inorganic nitrogen dip dissolved inorganic phosphorus don dissolved organic nitrogen dop dissolved organic phosphorus and oocysts from cryptosporidium 2 material and methods 2 1 marina global l model we develop the marina global l model model to assess river inputs of pollutnts to sea for livestock fig 1 it quantifies annual inputs of nutrients and oocysts to rivers from individual livestock species in 10 226 sub basins for 2010 this number of sub basins is larger than in earlier studies for example mayorga et al 2010 focused on around 6000 basins in our study large basins are split into sub basins details are in strokal et al 2021a in total it results in 10 226 sub basins in the world oocysts of cryptosporidium in our marina global l model are examples of pathogens marina global l is based on the existing marina global model strokal et al 2021a but integrates the three modeling approaches for livestock the glowpa crypto l1 global waterborne pathogen crypto sporidium from livestock and glowpa crypto c1 model global waterborne pathogen crypto sporidium concentration for oocysts vermeulen et al 2017 2019 and the marina modeling approach of chen et al resubmission for nutrients the marina global model and glowpa models are described in supplementary text 1 and text 2 the marina global l model accounts for eleven livestock species following the glowpa crypto l1 model vermeulen et al 2017 these are buffaloes camels cattle chickens ducks donkeys goats horses mules pigs and sheep the model distinguishes the two main systems of livestock manure management grazing and storage in the grazing systems animals drop their manure directly on land in the storage systems manure is collected and stored before application on land we account for losses of nutrients and oocysts during storage before manure application these are for example denitrification of n and decay of oocysts during manure storage strokal et al 2016 vermeulen et al 2017 we account for removals and losses in soils as a function of runoff generally the model distinguishes between losses to rivers via surface runoff from soils after manure application and point direct discharges of manure to rivers sources of nutrients and oocysts in rivers from livestock production direct discharges of manure to rivers are only the point source for chinese rivers strokal et al 2016 chadwick et al 2015 the model considers the crop livestock relation the model includes the application of synthetic fertilizers and animal manure on land in calculating inputs of manure relevant pollutants from land to rivers the main model inputs include livestock numbers the excretion rates of cryptosporidium and nutrients the prevalence of cryptosporidiosis manure production per animal manure management and runoff fig 1 details in tables s1 s7 figs s1 s4 most of the model inputs for calculating manure associated nutrients and oocysts on land are derived from the glowpa crypto l1 model vermeulen et al 2017 collected data from various sources bouwman et al 2013 robinson et al 2014 ipcc 2006 safley et al 1992 weedon et al 2011 therefore here we take the data for oocysts from vermeulen et al 2017 at 0 5 grid or country scales details in fig s1 in addition some model inputs such as n and p excretion rates fractions of n volatilization and direct discharges of manure are from literature bouwman et al 1997 bouwman and van der hoek 1997 2017 ipcc 2006 sheldrick et al 2003 smith 1991 and nufer nutrient flows in food chains environment and resources use datasets at a country scale ma et al 2012 nutrient inputs to cropland from the application of synthetic fertilizers atmospheric n deposition and biological n fixation are derived from the updated image gnm integrated model to assess the global environment global nutrient model model beusen et al 2015 for cryptosporidium the glowpa crypto c1 model provided model inputs such as runoff fractions for oocysts and their decay vermeulen et al 2019 we process country or grid model inputs to sub basins as table s4 describes the final model outputs are annual inputs of din dip don dop and cryptosporidium as oocysts to rivers eqs 1 5 fig 1 these outputs are by sub basin eleven livestock species grazing and storage systems and by point and diffuse sources figs 2 6 calculations are done in two steps fig 1 first inputs of the pollutants to land are calculated from animal manure n p and oocysts eq 1 this is done as a function of manure management livestock number and removal during storage systems for nutrients inputs of total n and p to land are calculated second inputs of the pollutants to rivers are calculated as a function of inputs to land corrected for crop uptake n and p and soil associated retention rates for n p and oocysts eqs 2 5 soil associated retentions reflect the removal of pollutants during export from land to rivers this includes for instance oocysts decay and n denitrification for nutrients inputs of dissolved inorganic and organic n and p to rivers are calculated the sum of inorganic and organic forms equals to the total dissolved n tdn and total dissolved p tdp for n and p we accounted for crop production receiving nutrients from not only manure but also from synthetic fertilizers atmospheric n deposition and biological n fixation eq 3 we corrected the amount of n and p in soils for crop uptake g p j in eq 3 the main equations to calculate inputs of nutrients and oocysts to land and rivers are as follows details are in tables s1 s7 1 wsdi f t i j wsdi f t i sg j wsdi f t i ss j n u t r i e n t s o

model evaluation is presented in section 4 1 2 2 defining pollution hotspots we define pollution hotspots for the inputs of nutrients and oocysts to land and rivers inspired by the approach of wang et al 2018 we first rank the inputs of nutrients and oocysts to land and rivers per km2 of sub basin area from the lowest to the highest values from level i lowest to level iv highest level iv includes the highest values top 10 most polluted sub basins the other three levels reflect the lower values the ranges to some extent arbitrary are described below for inputs to land levels i ii and iii have the following ranges for level i inputs of n to land range from 0 to 200 kg km2 yr this is from 0 to 10 kg km2 yr for p and from 0 to 1 3 1013 oocysts km2 yr for cryptosporidium ranges of level ii are as follows 200 750 kg km2 yr for n 10 88 kg km2 yr for p and 1 3 1013 2 1013 oocysts km2 yr for cryptosporidium ranges of level iii are as follow 750 1151 kg km2 yr for n 88 257 kg km2 yr for p and 2 1013 3 73 1013 oocysts km2 yr for cryptosporidium for inputs to rivers levels i ii and iii have the following ranges for level i inputs of tdn to rivers range from 0 to 30 kg km2 yr this is from 0 to 1 kg km2 yr for tdp and from 0 to 0 4 1013 oocysts km2 yr for cryptosporidium ranges of level ii are 30 150 kg km2 yr for tdn 1 3 kg km2 yr for tdp and 0 4 1013 0 8 1013 oocysts km2 yr for cryptosporidium for level iii the ranges are 150 234 kg km2 yr for tdn 3 8 1 kg km2 yr for tdp and 0 8 1013 1 6 1013oocysts km2 yr for cryptosporidium level iv is considered a pollution hotspot level iv has sub basins in the top 10 with the highest inputs of nutrients and oocysts on land and in rivers we also define multi pollutant hotspots for this sub basins are further classified based on the number of pollutants for which the inputs of at least two of the pollutants to land or rivers are in the top highest 10 under level iv 3 results 3 1 nutrients and oocysts on land from livestock globally 123 tg n 23 tg p and 1 0 1022 oocysts are excreted in livestock manure in 2010 fig s4 not all of this reaches the land some may be retained in storage or lost to water or air as a net effect 94 tg n 19 tg p and 2 9 1021 oocysts are applied on land fig s5 globally grazing systems contribute 58 of p 63 of n and 64 of oocysts to land fig 2 the share of the grazing and storage systems in manure inputs to land differ among continents fig 2 in many continents the grazing systems are dominant contributors to n p and oocysts on land this is different in europe p oocysts north america n p oocysts and asia n and p where more than half of manure inputs to land are from storage systems fig 2 and largely from chickens ducks and pigs fig s5 asia south america and africa are responsible for over 68 of global n p and oocysts on land in 2010 fig 3 for example livestock in these three continents contributes 70 tg n 13 tg p and 2 0 1021 oocysts on land fig 3 the largest share is for asia this is largely associated with a large number of animals in this continent fig s3 table s8 the contribution of europe is 12 12 and 18 to global inputs of n p and oocysts to land respectively fig 4 this contribution is smaller than the contribution of asia because the livestock numbers in asia are five times higher than that in europe fig s3 table s8 inputs of n p and oocysts to land differ largely among sub basins fig 3 hotspots of n p and oocysts on land are mainly concentrated in sub basins in europe india the middle parts of africa and south america and the eastern part of china fig 3 for example many sub basins in europe asia north and south america receive more n p and oocysts 1151 kgn km2 257 kgp km2 and 3 73 1013 oocysts km2 yr than other sub basins in 2010 this also holds for some sub basins in africa fig 3 as a result 1302 sub basins can be considered as pollution hotspots of nutrients and oocysts with inputs of n p and oocysts to land exceeding 1151 kg n km2 257 kg p km2 and 3 73 1013 oocyst km2 level iv 12 of the global sub basin areas 1 6 107 km2 is highly polluted by three types of substances simultaneously almost all sub basins in europe are influenced by three types of substances in addition the main chinese sub basins contribute a considerable amount 4 4 tg yr for n 1 tg yr for p and 1 1020 oocysts yr for cryptosporidium to the global inputs of nutrients and oocysts to land as a result of intensive livestock production and direct discharge of manure to rivers cattle production is an important contributor to inputs of n p and oocysts to land in many sub basins and continents fig 3 and 4 in sub basins that we consider pollution hotspots the share of cattle production in the inputs of n p and oocysts per km2 ranges from 33 to 90 depending on sub basins and substance fig 3 for the european sub basin hotspots the contribution of pig production to oocysts on land is larger 57 than the contribution of the cattle 30 and chicken 11 production for the north american sub basin hotspots mainly in the mississippi river basin the contribution of pig manure to oocysts on land is larger 35 than the contribution of cattle 33 and chicken manure 27 fig 3 on a continental scale fig 4 the contribution of cattle manure is also larger compared to the other livestock this holds for most continents and substances chicken production plays an important role in continents such as asia north america and south america mainly for p and oocysts pig production is important in asia for n and p europe for n p and oocysts and north america for oocysts fig 4 3 2 nutrients and oocysts in rivers from livestock approximately 22 tg tdn 1 8 tg tdp and 1 3 1021 oocysts enter rivers in 2010 around 20 tg n enter rivers as din and 2 tg n enter rivers as don for p this is 1 3 tg for dip and 0 5 tg for dop fig s4 however there is a large spatial variability in river pollution among continents fig 5 at the continental scale the majority of nutrients and oocysts input to rivers are calculated for asia and south america europe also accounts for large amounts of tdn and oocysts in rivers this can be explained by the spatial variability in livestock production and manure management fig 3 table s4 sub basins with river inputs exceeding 234 kg n km2 yr 8 1 kg p km2 yr and 1 6 1013 oocysts km2 yr are considered as pollution hotspots level iv one fourth of the sub basin areas 1592 sub basins are identified as river pollution hotspots with nutrients and cryptosporidium these pollution hotspots are responsible for 82 of tdn 95 of tdp and 71 of oocysts inputs to rivers globally fig 5 these hotspots are mainly found in asia europe and south america fig 5 cattle pigs and chickens are responsible for 74 88 of nutrients and oocysts in rivers in 2010 globally fig 6 cattle production takes the largest share in global river pollution which is similar on land fig 6 section 3 1 global inputs to rivers from cattle production are 12 tg of din 0 6 tg of don 0 5 tg of dip 0 1 tg of dop and 6 4 1020 oocysts in 2010 fig s6 the substances from livestock species enter rivers via diffuse and point sources chadwick et al 2015 strokal et al 2016 wang et al 2020 the share of diffuse and point sources in river pollution differs among the eleven types of livestock species fig 6 globally the share of diffuse sources surface runoff in river pollution from cattle production ranges from 51 to 63 depending on pollutants fig 6 it is much higher than the contribution from other livestock species however point sources of cattle production account for 15 25 of river pollution globally fig 6 this means that compared to other livestock species diffuse sources of cattle production are more important for river pollution than point sources this is different for pigs and chickens where point sources of manure play an important role compared to other livestock species globally for example pig production accounts for 21 of oocysts 25 of tdp and 38 of tdn in rivers globally from point sources fig 5 point sources from chicken production account for 8 of tdn 32 of tdp and 58 of oocysts in rivers globally point sources are particularly important for the sub basins in china 4 discussion 4 1 model uncertainties and comparisons our model integrates the glowpa and marina modeling approaches that were previously evaluated strokal et al 2021a strokal et al 2016 2019 vermeulen et al 2017 2019 the glowpa models have been validated using available observations for a set of rivers for cryptosporidium vermeulen et al 2017 for nutrients our model builds on the family of the marina models that were evaluated globally nationally and seasonally in several earlier studies x chen et al 2019a 2019b wang et al 2020 strokal et al 2016 yang et al 2019 goshu et al 2020 strokal et al 2021a e g r2 0 90 for the yangtze basin r2 0 84 for china we further evaluate our model using the building trust approach strokal 2016 strokal et al 2021a wang et al 2020 this includes comparisons with other studies sensitivity analyses and discussion of limitations and uncertainties comparisons of model inputs with other studies model inputs are for instance manure excretion and inputs of pollutants to land see section 2 our model inputs are generally in line with other studies supplementary table s11 16 supplementary text 4 globally our manure excretion is within the range of 80 130 tg n from the other studies bai et al 2016 bouwman et al 2013 fao 2018 sheldrick et al 2003 our total inputs of n and p on land coincide with other studies 91 92 tg n 17 tg p beusen et al 2015 bodirsky et al 2012 our manure excretion for p for 2010 23 tg is somewhat higher than an earlier estimate for 2000 17 tg of p bouwman et al 2013 one of the reasons could be that between 2000 and 2010 livestock production has increased this increase is estimated at around 20 globally faostat 2021 another reason could be the difference in the methods and scales details see supplementary text 4 we also compare n excretions with fao datasets food and agriculture organization of the united states for individual species table s12 our result is in line with fao datasets for the whole of china we calculate the manure excretion of 24 tg n and 4 5 tg p which is comparable to the study of bai et al 2016 for n 23 tg n and slightly lower for p 5 2 tg p because of different datasets and calculation methods table s13 supplementary text 4 spatial variabilities in manure excretion are generally in line with existing studies potter et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 potter et al 2010 presented the total manure production at 0 5 grids they focused on nutrients and did not distinguish the contribution of individual livestock species we do this for nutrients and oocysts at the sub basins scale zhang et al 2017 estimated n excretion from multiple livestock species at 5 arcmin grids our study and zhang et al 2017 indicate the large share of cattle pigs and chickens in the total n excretion comparisons of model outputs with other studies our model outputs are inputs of pollutants to rivers from manure we also compare model outputs with other models and are able to explain most of the difference in particular we compare inputs of different n and p forms in rivers with global news tables s17 the global news global nutrient export from watersheds model model calculates inputs of dissolved and organic forms of n and p to rivers from manure mayorga et al 2010 globally our model calculated 22 tg of tdn and 1 8 tg of tdp to rivers from manure in 2010 these estimates are higher than that in the global news model table s17 this also holds for our estimates of din don dip and dop to rivers table s17 the reasons are the differences in time space model inputs and modeling approaches between our model and global news for example we calculate river pollution for 2010 and global news for 2000 our model is based on a sub basin scale modeling approach and global news is based on a basin scale modeling approach the other reason is that we consider direct discharges of manure to chinese rivers which is ignored in global news spatial variabilities in river pollution hotspots are comparable with other studies wang et al 2020 van vliet et al 2019 mayorga et al 2010 vermeulen et al 2019 for example our river pollution hotspots in many sub basins of asia south america and africa coincide with existing studies mayorga et al 2010 vermeulen et al 2019 comparing to studies for nutrients less data or models are available for pathogen generally our model outputs for cryptosporidium in rivers are comparable with few existing studies atwill et al 2006 starkey et al 2007 our pollution hotspots of cryptosporidium match the pollution hotspots of other microorganisms hofstra et al 2019 reder et al 2015 it should be noted that observed values of oocysts in rivers are relatively uncertain in our study we focus on both nutrients and oocysts simultaneously which is not done in existing studies generally river pollution hotspots fig 5 are calculated for sub basins that also receive high manure inputs fig 3 this is in line with other studies e g beusen et al 2015 mayorga et al 2010 bouwman et al 2009 studies show that areas with higher runoff generally receive more pollutants yang and toor 2018 chen et al 2018 which is also shown in our study for sub basins examples are sub basins located in india south america and the south parts of china where the climate is relatively wet with more runoff compared to the north china plain with relatively dry climate zhang and wang 2021 in addition n is more mobile in soils than p strokal and de vries 2012 thus more n from land reaches rivers compared to p which is in line with our study oocysts can decay in soils vermeulen et al 2017 thus not all oocysts on land can reach rivers in our model we account for those factors when calculating inputs to rivers section 2 sensitivity analysis we test the sensitivity of the model outputs to changes in model inputs we ran our model with manure application from the updated image gnm model for n and p beusen et al 2015 results of this ran are comparable with our original model ran for the river pollution with nutrients and their spatial variabilities figs s7 s8 for cryptosporidium we ran the model with manure application from the glowpa crypto l1 model and the results are also comparable with our original model ran figs s7 s8 furthermore we compare two methods to aggregate model inputs we refer to the method used in our model as method 1 method 2 is an alternative that we use here for the sensitivity analysis in method 1 several model inputs e g fractions of grazing systems are aggregated from country or grids of 0 5 to sub basins based on livestock population density details in figs s7 s8 tables s4 s9 s10 this method is transparent but may introduce uncertainties in model outputs thus we use method 2 to test the sensitivity of model outputs to aggregation methods in method 2 we aggregate some of the model inputs from country or grids of 0 5 by averaging gridded values over the corresponding sub basins details in tables s4 s9 s10 we compare model outputs between these two aggregations methods tables s9 s10 this sensitivity analysis confirms that model outputs and our main conclusions are not largely affected by the processing methods of model inputs tables s9 s10 reflection on model uncertainties as any integrated models our model has uncertainties nevertheless we consider our model appropriate for large scale analyses based on the comparisons with observations independent datasets and other models as well as the sensitivity analysis see above model uncertainties are also associated with the modeling approach at the sub basin scale several models e g glowpa image gnm quantify pollution at the 0 5 grid scale vermeulen et al 2017 vermeulen et al 2019 beusen et al 2015 other models do this on the basin scale e g global news mayorga et al 2010 our model is in between these two scales we focus on sub basins not too course basin and not too detailed grid the choice for the sub basin scale modeling is justified by the research aim indeed some datasets are at grids e g livestock numbers however others are national or even regional e g manure management treatments we aggregate datasets into the sub basins and make datasets consistent for nutrients and oocysts see our supporting information for details we believe that all scales grids basins sub basins have pros and cons we consider sub basins appropriate in our study considering the availability and uncertainties of the datasets at different scales we apply a lumped modeling approach to calculate inputs of pollutants from land to rivers as a function of runoff in this approach processes for losses of pollutants in soils e g denitrification decay of oocysts are modeled at the sub basin scale other studies modeled nutrients or cryptosporidium for full basins mayorga et al 2010 or 0 5 grids beusen et al 2015 vermeulen et al 2019 our sub basin scale approach is based on successful earlier model applications strokal et al 2021a strokal et al 2016 wang et al 2020 chen et al 2019a 2019b we improve these earlier studies by harmonizing the model inputs for nutrients and oocysts to the same spatial and temporal level of detail we use a process based approach to calculate export fractions of nutrients from land to rivers in sub basins tables s4 s5 thus our model does not rely on parameters that were calibrated using a limited set of observations for a certain year or period reflection on limitations our modeling approach focuses on dissolved nutrients and surface waters rivers we do not account for particulates implying that our pollution levels might be underestimated an important reason is that we focus on dissolved nutrient forms in surface waters that result from manure in livestock production particulate nutrients are mainly in rivers from erosion processes beusen et al 2005 on the other hand we show the impact of livestock production on surface water pollution which is the main objective of this study in addition existing studies point out the importance of vadose zone interflow and groundwater in water pollution assessments for example hartmann et al 2021 pointed out that up to 50 of infiltrating pollutants may enter groundwater through rapid transport pathways some studies indicate that nutrients and oocysts can transport to groundwater through deep percolation khan et al 2018 balthazard accou et al 2020 gu et al 2013 therefore the next steps would be to add erosion and explore approaches to account for multiple pollutants in groundwater in our study we account for interactions between nutrients and oocysts at the source site for example manure is a common source of both nutrients and pathogens on land and in rivers runoff is the common pathway of these pollutants to reach rivers however our model does not account for biogeochemical interactions between nutrients and oocysts in rivers the knowledge in this field is very limited for large scale water quality modeling a few studies addressed interactions tamis et al 2021 kong et al 2019 but were limited to data and scale more research is needed to better understand interactions between nutrients and pathogens in river systems our results are for the year 2010 which is about 10 years from now we may under or overestimate pollution levels in sub basins for today however we believe that our conclusions are still relevant we showed the pollution hotspots as the priority areas for effective manure management we believe that the locations of those hotspots did not change much between 2010 and today this is because those places remain densely populated with intensive livestock production e g asian sub basins another conclusion is the importance of manure as the common source of multiple pollutants in rivers we also believe that this conclusion is highly relevant today we show the large contribution of pigs cattle and chickens to river pollution today these animals remain important producers of meat for human consumption faostat 2021 this implies that managing the manure of these species is still relevant for reducing future river pollution by multiple pollutants moreover we present our results on the global e g fig 6 continental fig 4 and sub basin scales e g fig 5 thus our insights are relevant for water management at those scales for management at local scales such as farms our model needs further validation all of the above builds trust in our model results for large scale analyses we argue that the inevitable uncertainties in the model inputs and approach do not largely affect our main conclusions however for local analyses of livestock impacts on multi pollutant problems e g within sub basins villages our model needs to be further evaluated and validated 4 2 livestock management to reduce river pollution our study provides four insights for livestock management first we show the priority areas sub basins for pollution reduction in the world fig 5 sub baisns allow us to account for the spatial variability especially within the large basins e g mississippi yangtze nile danube amazon many studies confirms that water pollution is a worldwide problem for instance nutrient cycling and associated pollution are global phenomena nutrient induced eutrophication is found in many surface water such as rivers estuaries and lakes lapointe et al 2017 wynne and stumpf 2015 lehman et al 2015 isaacs et al 2014 strokal et al 2016 mayorga et al 2010 pathogen pollution is also a problem in many developing countries posing health risks bouzid et al 2018 this is a result of livestock production and insufficient manure management leading to high inputs of pollutants to land and thus to rivers figs 3 and 5 global change may influence the intensity of livestock production and runoff causing pollution in the coming years herrero et al 2016 ilea 2009 impacts of global change have to be considered in formulating effective management options to reduce pollution hotspots second our study can help to identify the contributions of livestock systems to river pollution we show that grazing systems dominate in some regions e g oceania africa and storage systems in others e g europe north america this indicates where and what efforts are needed to reduce manure related river pollution for example reducing pollutants to rivers from grazing systems is needed in africa reducing pollutants to rivers from storage systems is needed in europe this means that effective manure management is important for both systems to avoid future river pollution globally third we provide a better understanding of the contribution of livestock species to river pollution taking a multi pollutant perspective this was not done before for river sub basins and n p and oocysts simultaneously our study can be considered an urgent call for better manure management in the production of pigs cattle and chickens globally figs 3 and 6 this differs among sub basins for example for asian sub basins river pollution reduction is needed from the production of pigs sheep cattle and chickens this information could be used to define sub basin specific strategies to manage manure effectively examples of such technologies are livestock feed management ershadi et al 2020 dietary guidelines health canada 2019 caro et al 2017 or livestock specific policies fourth our study indicates the dominant water pollution sources diffuse and point source for multiple pollutants diffuse sources are most important globally and point sources are important for china to our knowledge this is also the first attempt to quantify the impact of livestock production on multiple pollutants in rivers by source from individual livestock species for sub basins simultaneously for example existing studies also showed the importance of point sources for chinese rivers chadwick et al 2015 strokal et al 2016 but mainly for nutrients we take a multi pollutant approach and focus on nutrients and oocysts furthermore existing studies show the importance of diffuse sources but only for individual pollution types tang et al 2011 van vliet et al 2019 our model could be used for scenario analysis to explore the synergetic actions for reducing multiple pollutants in rivers in the future our model could also be used to analyze the impact of upstream activities on downstream water pollution 4 3 implications for the achievement of sustainable development goals sustainable livestock production supports sustainable development goal sdg 2 on food security and sdg 6 on clean water and sanitation mehrabi et al 2020 sakadevan and nguyen 2017 tilman and clark 2014 improving livestock production and its manure management sdg 2 could potentially reduce river pollution with nutrients and oocysts sdg 6 mehrabi et al 2020 strokal et al 2021a this is a synergetic effect between sdgs 2 and 6 our results indicate where sub basins and what sources point or diffuse we need to focus on in livestock production sdg 2 to reduce river pollution sdg 6 this information could support the formulation of effective management options for livestock production that can account for synergies between sdg 2 and sdg 6 and mitigate their trade offs e g more manure may lead to more multiple pollutants in rivers synergetic solutions are needed to mitigate multi pollutant problems in many rivers worldwide effects of policies on river pollution have been explored in existing studies for many world regions yasin et al 2010 eu commission 2019 lnv 2018 china plays an important role in reducing global river pollution from livestock production the chinese government promotes the agriculture green development agd with high agricultural production and low environmental impacts shen et al 2020 agd facilitates the implementation of environmental policies for instance non livestock production regions and pig relocation policies have been introduced to controlling surface water pollution bai et al 2019 the water pollution preventions and control plan have also been introduced to avoid pollution central people s government of the people s republic of china 2015 agd can serve as an example for other regions this is because agd combines efforts in integrating knowledge of crop animal food processing and environmental aspects for effective solutions strokal et al 2021b models have been used to quantify the effects of those policies on reducing nutrient pollution in rivers in the future wang et al 2020 agd highly supports the sdg and can be used for other countries as inspiration towards sustainable agriculture our model can be used to explore the effects of the agd policies on river pollution in china and elsewhere 5 conclusions this study quantified inputs of n p and oocysts from cryptosporidium to rivers from livestock production by animal types and in a spatially explicit way to this end we developed and applied the marina global l model to 10 226 sub basins for nutrients and oocysts results showed that around 94 tg n 19 tg p and 2 9 1021 oocysts were applied on land from livestock production in 2010 over 57 of nutrients and oocysts were from the grazed animal systems asia south america and africa were responsible for over 68 of these pollutants on land we calculated that around 22 tg tdn 1 8 tg tdp and 1 3 1021 oocysts entered rivers in 2010 one fourth of the sub basin area was responsible for 71 95 of nutrients and oocysts in rivers cattle pigs and chickens contributed by 74 88 to manure related inputs of nutrients and oocysts in rivers

16414,increasing numbers of studies have reported groundwater with naturally high phosphorous p and arsenic as concentrations which can potentially threaten the environment and human health however the cycling of p and its interactions with as in groundwater under changing redox conditions remain largely unknown in this study 83 groundwater samples and 14 sediment samples were collected from the hetao basin inner mongolia for systematic hydrogeochemical investigation and complementary geochemical evaluation the results showed that p cycling in floodplain aquifers was tightly constrained by redox conditions under oxic suboxic conditions mineralization of organic matter and weathering of p bearing minerals were the two dominant processes that mobilized considerable amounts of p in groundwater when redox conditions became reducing fe iii oxide reduction dominated resulting in enrichment of both p and as in groundwater in fe iii reducing conditions secondary ca fe ii minerals might serve as an important sink for p when redox conditions became so4 2 reducing preferential adsorption and incorporation of p over as on fe ii sulfides might constrain the as immobilization pathway resulting in immediate retardation of p and hysteretic immobilization of as this p immobilization pathway in natural aquifers has not been described before this study provides novel insights into p cycling and as enrichment in groundwater systems understanding the roles of fe ii and s ii minerals in the immobilization of and interaction between p and as in response to so4 2 reduction may help to inspire effective in situ remediation of contaminated groundwater in which p and as coexist and remain mobile for decades or longer graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phosphorus cycling arsenic changing redox conditions mobilization competitive immobilization 1 introduction in recent years the biogeochemical cycling of phosphorus p in groundwater ecosystems has drawn increasing attention because high p groundwater may serve as an effective source of surface water and increase the risk of lake eutrophication lewandowski et al 2015 mcdowell et al 2015 meinikmann et al 2015 yu et al 2018 furthermore p plays an important role in the enrichment of toxic arsenic as in groundwater which threatens the health of people who use it for drinking and irrigation biswas et al 2014 rathi et al 2017 neidhardt et al 2021 in the floodplain and delta aquifers of many asian countries numerous studies have reported the presence of groundwater with simultaneously high concentrations of p and as mcarthur et al 2004 neidhardt et al 2018 although there has been comprehensive research on the biogeochemical cycling of as in groundwater over recent decades less is known about p mobilization and immobilization mechanisms and its interactions with as in floodplain aquifers in floodplain aquifers it is well known that the important processes underlying the mobilization of as are tightly constrained by redox conditions borch et al 2010 guo et al 2014 under oxic conditions the oxidation of pyrite is considered to be the dominant process that mobilizes as into groundwater jones and pichler 2007 when the redox conditions change from oxic to reducing the biological reduction of fe iii oxides induced by the microbial degradation of organic matter om is believed to be the major mechanism of as mobilization in the presence of fe iii reducing bacteria mcarthur et al 2004 xiu et al 2020 currently only a few studies have investigated the sources and processes of p enrichment in groundwater e g in the red river delta bengal delta and jianghan basin mcarthur et al 2004 neidhardt et al 2018 tao et al 2020 these show that om mineralization and reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides are the important processes causing p mobilization however the geochemical behaviour of p under sulphate reducing conditions remains unknown no studies have focused on the redox constraints on groundwater p cycling under changing redox conditions such information would help to understand the distinct differences between the behaviours of p and as in aquifer systems biogeochemical redox processes in groundwater systems may also immobilize p and as under anoxic conditions the sorption of dissolved as to primary and secondary minerals e g siderite vivianite metal hydr oxides clay minerals is assumed to be the main as immobilization process in floodplain aquifers robertson et al 2008 kanematsu et al 2013 dissolved p is immobilized by fe iii oxides at sediment boundaries when groundwater flows from a reducing aquifer to an oxic aquifer neidhardt et al 2018 2021 furthermore bacterial sulphate reduction is known to play a key role in the immobilization of as through the formation of ferrous sulfide minerals o day et al 2004 pi et al 2017 in the study of wang et al 2020a ferrous sulfide minerals pyrite and greigite were found in the peat layers of floodplain aquifers in the hetao basin which act as a stable sink for as under anoxic groundwater conditions however the constraint of sulphate reduction on p immobilization remains unknown in floodplain aquifers phosphate po4 3 is regarded as the dominant p species in circumneutral groundwater mcarthur et al 2004 neidhardt et al 2018 ioka et al 2021 po4 3 sorption can be strongly affected by ph and other competing oxyanions parkhurst et al 2003 at near neutral and weakly alkaline ph conditions dissolved as predominantly in the form of inorganic arsenite as iii h3aso3 and arsenate as v h2aso4 and haso4 2 is efficiently adsorbed onto aquifer sediments in the absence of po4 3 von brömssen et al 2008 biswas et al 2014 however the characteristics of competition between p and as during their immobilization via the ongoing precipitation of ferrous sulfide minerals remains unknown to conclude there is a need to closely investigate p mobilization and immobilization processes and the interaction of p with as under the changing redox conditions of floodplain aquifers this would provide novel insights into p cycling and the enrichment of p and as in groundwater systems the north western part of hetao basin inner mongolia features an obvious and characteristic hydrogeochemical zonation in its groundwater which is distributed from alluvial fans near mountains over a transition area towards a floodplain along the area of hydrogeochemical zonation the groundwater redox conditions change from oxidizing to reducing jia et al 2014 this setting provided us with the opportunity to systematically investigate the dominant im mobilization mechanisms of p and as under specific and clearly discernible redox conditions therefore the distributions of dissolved p as and other redox components were investigated in the hydrogeochemical redox zones of the study area the objectives were to 1 identify the processes that underlie p mobilization under oxidizing conditions 2 reveal the mechanisms of p and as mobilization when redox conditions change from oxic to reducing and 3 understand p immobilization processes and interactions with as under sulphate reducing conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the northwestern hetao basin inner mongolia it includes alluvial fans near mountains and a flat plain in the centre of a floodplain fig 1 to the northwest the basin is bordered by the langshan mountains which were uplifted between the jurassic and pleistocene at the southern margin of the basin the yellow river flows from west to east cao et al 2018 the hetao basin is filled with quaternary sediments of about 1500 8000 m thickness which are mainly derived from the metamorphic complex of the langshan mountains and partly from fluvial deposits of the yellow river guo et al 2008 deng et al 2009 according to borehole logging data and previous hydrogeological reports thick clay layers usually occur in the sediments at depths ranging from 39 5 to 44 1 m below land surface bls inner mongolia institute of hydrology 2014 shallow groundwater is hosted in unconfined aquifers overlying the clay layers while deep groundwater is hosted in semi confined aquifers underlying the clay layers jia et al 2014 there is a west east main drainage channel located in the north of the floodplain fig 1 to the northern side of the main drainage channel groundwater flows from the northwest to the southeast near the mountains with hydraulic conductivity that decreases from approximately 9 m d 1 to 3 8 m d 1 inner mongolia institute of hydrology 2014 gao et al 2020 in the alluvial fan near the mountains the aquifers consist of pluvial alluvial sediments whereas the aquifer sediments in the central flat plain are mainly composed of inland lacustrine sediments guo et al 2013 a transition area has been identified between the alluvial fan and flat plain which is characterized by mixed source sediment depositions guo et al 2016a gao et al 2020 to the southern side of the channel where the flat plain dominates the central floodplain the groundwater dynamics are quite complex due to the strong effects of yellow river irrigation and a dense network of drainage channels gao et al 2020 due to the different groundwater flow dynamics we differentiated the flat plain into the flat plain i near the mountains and the flat plain ii in the centre of the floodplain using the main drainage channel as the dividing line from the mountains to the centre of the floodplain the redox conditions of both the shallow and deep aquifers change from oxic to reducing with clear reduction sequences in favour of o2 no3 as v fe iii and so4 2 jia et al 2014 guo et al 2016a gao et al 2020 in general the groundwater ph is neutral to weakly alkaline from the alluvial fan near the mountains to the centre of the floodplain the groundwater is characterized by gradually increasing concentrations of fe ii nh4 s2 and as gao et al 2020 2 2 groundwater sampling and analysis in the study area 83 groundwater samples were collected from shallow and deep aquifers with depths of 10 100 m bls in june 2019 these

c until laboratory analysis details on groundwater laboratory analyses and relative analytical precision are given in the supporting information groundwater data including physicochemical parameters measured in the field and elemental concentrations analysed in the laboratory were used to calculate saturation indices si using phreeqc software v 2 thermodynamic database wateq4f this was done to identify possible mineral phases that serve as sources or sinks for p and as in the aquifers parkhurst and appelo 1999 2 3 sediment sampling and analysis two boreholes were drilled for sediment sampling in the study area k1 in the flat plain i and k2 in the transition area fig 1 fourteen sediment samples seven from k1 and seven from k2 were collected at various depths of 10 80 m bls after taken out from boreholes sediment cores were logged and split according to lithology and colur variations within several minutes then sediment sections were immediately wrapped with aluminium foil sealed in sterile polythene bags filled with ultrapure n2 gas 99 999 and kept at 20 c after transport to the laboratory all sediment samples were stored in an ultra low temperature freezer at 80 c

assisted aqua regia pressure digestion method e701 mls gmbh see details in neidhardt et al 2019 a 5 step sequential extraction scheme modified from neidhardt et al 2021 was applied to extract

components of these sediments are available elsewhere wang et al 2020a 2020b 2 4 statistical analysis all geochemical data were analysed using microsoft excel 2019 and spss statistical software v 25 shapiro wilk tests were used to check the normality of the datasets based on the outcomes the group means of variables from different zones and aquifers were compared using one way anova or non parametric kruskal wallis one way anova of ranks with pairwise post hoc tests lsd with significance values adjusted by bonferroni correlation the relationships between the measured variables were explored by two tailed spearman rank correlation tests the confidence interval for all tests was 95 and p values 0 05 were considered statistically significant 3 results 3 1 general groundwater chemistry the physicochemical parameters of the groundwater samples are summarized in table s1 groundwater generally had neutral to weakly alkaline ph values ranging from 6 5 to 9 1 with a median of 7 5 high tds and high alkalinity groundwater was mainly observed in the flat plain i and ii in both shallow and deep aquifers groundwater doc was not significant different p 0 05 between shallow and deep aquifers and increased in both from the alluvial fan to the flat plain i in the flat plain ii shallow groundwater doc remained high fig 2 a based on the variations in major cations and anions in different zones the groundwater types in shallow and deep aquifers changed from ca hco3 so4 in the alluvial fan to na cl in the flat plain i and ii fig s1 the redox conditions generally varied from oxic suboxic to anoxic orp range 172 mv to 131 mv with median orp values decreasing from the alluvial fan to the flat plain i for both shallow and deep aquifers in the flat plain ii the redox conditions of the shallow aquifer remained anoxic with a low median orp value table s1 fig 2b in the alluvial fan the median concentrations of no3 in shallow and deep groundwater were 1 06 mg l 1 and 1 53 mg l 1 respectively while they both decreased to 0 01 mg l 1 in the transition area and flat plain table s1 although groundwater nh4 was significantly higher p 0 05 in the deep aquifer than in the shallow aquifer in the transition area and in the flat plain i groundwater nh4 in both aquifers increased along the groundwater flow path fig 2c in the flat plain ii shallow groundwater nh4 kept increasing to the median of 4 23 mg l 1 groundwater fe ii presented a significant increase from the alluvial fan to the flat plain i for both aquifers in the shallow aquifer of the flat plain ii groundwater fe ii concentrations were low with a median of 0 62 mg l 1 table s1 fig 2d groundwater so4 2 had a wide range of 13 1 1473 mg l 1 in the two aquifers table s1 to eliminate the effect of evaporation the so4 2 cl ratio was used as a substitute for so4 2 concentration jia et al 2014 guo et al 2016a as shown in fig 2e the so4 2 cl ratios in both aquifers decreased from the alluvial fan to the flat plain i in the flat plain ii the shallow groundwater so4 2 cl ratio was even lower with a median of 0 50 from the alluvial fan to the transition area groundwater s2 concentrations increased in both aquifers however the median concentrations of s2 in the two aquifers decreased significantly from the transition area to the flat plain i p 0 05 in the flat plain ii groundwater s2 kept decreasing reaching a minimum in the shallow aquifer table s1 fig 2f 3 2 groundwater p and as concentrations groundwater p ranged from 15 0 μg l 1 to 221 μg l 1 with a median of 86 8 μg l 1 more than 70 of the groundwater samples had p concentrations exceeding 50 μg l 1 in the alluvial fan the concentrations of p in both aquifers were lower than in other zones in the transition area although groundwater p in the deep aquifer was higher than that in the shallow aquifer they both increased reaching the highest concentrations however the increases in groundwater p in the two aquifers were retarded in the flat plain i where shallow groundwater p remained steady and deep groundwater p decreased significantly p 0 05 fig 2g in the flat plain ii shallow groundwater p decreased to a low median value the different p species found in the groundwater are shown in table s1 these results show that tdp accounted for 93 3 n 83 standard error 1 81 of the corresponding tp concentration indicating that dissolved p is the dominant species moreover 67 of the 83 groundwater samples had po4 3 concentrations 85 of the corresponding tdp concentration showing that dissolved po4 3 is the dominant form of p in the groundwater groundwater as concentrations ranged from 0 40 μg l 1 to 435 μg l 1 with a median of 67 9 μg l 1 more than 90 of the groundwater samples exceeded an as concentration of 10 μg l 1 the lowest as concentrations were also found in the alluvial fan in both aquifers groundwater as in both aquifers increased significantly from the alluvial fan through the transition area to the flat plain i in the flat plain ii the shallow groundwater as decreased to a low median value fig 2h the observed as species including as iii and as v are shown in table s1 as iii was the major as species accounting for 60 of the total as in the investigated groundwater while as v typically accounted for 40 no organic as species were detected such as monomethylarsonic acid mma and dimethylarsinic acid dma groundwater p as ratios ranged from 0 10 to 17 8 with a median of 1 42 the highest groundwater p as ratios were observed in the alluvial fan in both aquifers in the transition area groundwater p as ratios in both aquifers decreased significantly and kept decreasing to a minimum in the flat plain i in the flat plain ii the p as ratio of shallow groundwater had a low median value but was higher than that in the adjacent flat plain i fig 2i groundwater p concentrations were positively correlated with groundwater fe ii r 0 50 p 0 01 and s2 r 0 59 p 0 01 and negatively correlated with orp r 0 64 p 0 01 figs s2d s2g and s2a from the alluvial fan to the transition area groundwater p had a positive correlation with nh4 r 0 58 p 0 01 fig s2i groundwater as was also positively correlated with groundwater fe ii r 0 69 p 0 01 and s2 r 0 42 p 0 01 and negatively correlated with orp r 0 66 p 0 01 fig s2e h and b from the alluvial fan to the transition area groundwater fe ii increased with s2 r 0 65 p 0 01 fig s2f however in the flat plain they both decreased r 0 49 p 0 01 fig s2f from the mountains to the centre of the floodplain groundwater nh4 had a negative correlation with orp r 0 49 p 0 01 fig s2c and a positive correlation with doc r 0 73 p 0 01 moreover from the transition area to the flat plain i both the groundwater p as ratios and s2 concentrations decreased and were positively correlated r 0 48 p 0 01 however they were negatively correlated r 0 64 p 0 01 from the flat plain i to the flat plain ii where the groundwater p as ratios increased while s2 concentrations decreased additionally thermodynamic calculations demonstrated that groundwater in the alluvial fan was unsaturated with respect to hydroxyapatite vivianite siderite and fes approaching the centre of the floodplain these minerals became oversaturated in the transition area and flat plain fig s3 from the alluvial fan to the flat plain groundwater p as ratios were negatively correlated with the saturation indices of fes r 0 45 p 0 01 and vivianite r 0 49 p 0 01 descriptions of the mineral saturation indices are provided in the supporting information 3 3 sediment geochemistry and p and as pools the aquifer sediments in drilling cores k1 and k2 mainly consisted of silt to fine sand covered by silty clay or clay layers at depths of approximately 0 10 m bls at about 40 m bls a clay layer separated the upper unconfined aquifer and lower semi confined aquifer fig 3 table s2 lists the bulk contents of the major metal components and tp of the aquifer sediments there were higher contents of ca al and fe than mg and mn in the sediments the mean sediment as contents was 8 20 mg kg 1 n 14 with a range of 3 27 18 4 mg kg 1 the mean tp content was 326 mg kg 1 n 14 with a range of 200 600 mg kg 1 the tp contents in the sediments had strong positive correlations with as r 0 89 ca r 0 98 and fe r 0 98 p 0 01 fig s4 sediment total p and as contents were generally dependent on the lithological characteristics high p and as contents were mostly found in clay silty clay layers at the depths of 15 7 and 40 0 m in drilling core k1 and 65 4 m in k2 with mean values of 515 and 17 2 mg kg 1 respectively n 3 fig 3 in the sand silt layers p and as contents were comparatively low with mean values of 274 and 6 55 mg kg 1 n 11 accordingly groundwater sampled adjacent to clay silty clay layers generally had lower p and as concentrations than that sampled from other depths in the two drilling wells fig 3 the results of the sedimentary p and as pools are shown in table 1 and fig 3 ca fe ii minerals represented the dominant p pool with a mean portion of 91 2 n 14 of total extractable p exchangeable p and p in fe iii oxides only contributed small proportions to the overall p pool relative proportions of 4 12 and 2 84 respectively strongly sorbed p and residual p remained low organic p porg contents from the first two steps of the sequential extraction were calculated as the differences between tp and po4 3 contents only in the exchangeable p pool were porg contents mostly detectable as shown in table s3 in drilling core k2 which was located in the transition area the median extractable porg content in the exchangeable p pool was 1 57 mg kg 1 while in k1 from the flat plain it increased to 5 38 mg kg 1 in the depth profile there was much more extractable porg in the clay silty clay layers mean content 13 7 mg kg 1 n 3 than in the sand silt layers mean content 2 09 mg kg 1 n 11 fig 3 fe iii oxides were the predominant as pool with a mean portion of 61 1 n 14 strongly sorbed as occupied a mean portion of 23 5 of the total extractable as residual as and as in ca fe ii minerals made minor contribution to the overall p pool relative proportions of 8 10 and 6 67 respectively exchangeable as was low in the depth profile the different sedimentary p and as pools were all higher in clay silty clay layers than in sand silt layers table 1 fig 3 4 discussion from the alluvial fan to the flat plain both groundwater doc and nh4 concentrations increased significantly p 0 05 figs 2a 2c this positive correlation r 0 73 p 0 01 indicates a gradual increase in om degradation towards the centre of the floodplain this corresponds with the study of zhou et al 2018 who demonstrated om degradation along a flow path by groundwater stable carbon isotope analysis in aquifers om degradation may serve as electron donor that rapidly deplete oxygen and change the redox conditions stumm and sulzberger 1992 along the flow path groundwater orp gradually decreased and was negatively correlated with nh4 concentrations r 0 48 p 0 01 fig s2c indicating changing redox conditions induced by om degradation the negative correlations of groundwater orp with p and with as figs s2a b suggest the cycling of p in particular the im mobilization of p is tightly constrained by redox conditions being similar to as accordingly the im mobilization mechanisms of p and its interactions with as in groundwater under changing redox conditions are discussed below 4 1 processes mobilizing p under oxic suboxic conditions in the alluvial fan near the mountains the median groundwater orp 29 6 mv and maximum orp 131 mv suggest that the aquifers have oxic suboxic conditions table s1 in the groundwater of the hetao basin degradation of microbially mediated om including organic nitrogen is the primary contributor to nh4 release gao et al 2021 under oxic conditions high no3 concentrations in the alluvial fan table s1 may result from the oxidation of nh4 via nitrification processes kelley et al 2013 xiu et al 2021 from the alluvial fan to the transition area the gradually decreasing orp and no3 values table s1 and fig 2b indicate an ongoing process of no3 reduction via heterotrophic denitrification ortmeyer et al 2021 under these conditions as concentrations were generally low but considerable p concentrations occurred in the groundwater resulting in relatively high p as ratios in the alluvial fan fig 2g h i one possible explanation for the p mobilization in the alluvial fan is the weathering of p containing minerals originating from the adjacent metamorphic complex of the langshan mountains guo et al 2016a reported p contents exceeding 1000 mg kg 1 in metamorphic and sedimentary rocks of the langshan mountains including schists and carbonatites moreover a high hydraulic conductivity of 9 m d 1 has been reported which is evidence of pronounced weathering impacts in this area institute of hydrogeology and environmental geology 2014 this explanation is further supported by the groundwater observed in the present study which was unsaturated with respect to hydroxyapatite and vivianite two principal p containing minerals table s1 and fig s3a b weathering of these minerals increases the dissolved p in groundwater as reported elsewhere edmunds et al 2013 flower et al 2016 schafer et al 2018 another potential mobilization mechanism for p is the mineralization of om in aquifers in the alluvial fan doc median 2 35 mg l 1 and high sedimentary om contents median 2 33 g kg 1 guo et al 2019 may serve as sources for microbial degradation processes in groundwater ecosystems nh4 mainly originates from the mineralization of n containing om and thus represents a useful indicator of om degradation rivett et al 2008 du et al 2020 in the alluvial fan and in the transition area po4 3 was the dominant p species in groundwater table s1 increases in nh4 and p concentrations from the alluvial fan to the transition area and their positive correlation r 0 58 p 0 01 fig s2i suggest that ongoing om mineralization is an important groundwater p mobilization process in the form of po4 3 in these two zones table s1 and fig 2c g desorption of po4 3 at high phs may be another cause of p mobilization under oxic suboxic conditions in floodplain aquifers when the ph exceeds 6 8 the adsorption capacity of po4 3 on fe iii oxides sharply decreases as a result of oh competitive adsorption zhou et al 2005 thereby mobilizing po4 3 into groundwater huang et al 2020 in the study area groundwater occurred in neutral weakly alkaline conditions with high phs table s1 high phs also drastically decrease as adsorption on fe iii oxides resulting in high as concentrations podgorski et al 2017 however less as was observed in the groundwater of the alluvial fan furthermore there was no significant correlation between groundwater p concentrations and ph suggesting that the desorption of po4 3 at high phs only plays a minor role in p mobilization in this area therefore under oxic suboxic conditions in the alluvial fan weathering of p bearing minerals and mineralization of om were the two important processes that mobilized considerable amounts of p into groundwater 4 2 processes mobilizing both p and as under anoxic conditions in the transition area and flat plain there were low negative orp values and a negative correlation between nh4 concentrations and orps fig 2b c s2c r 0 48 p 0 01 this suggests that the redox conditions changing from oxic into anoxic is due to increasing om mineralization in response to the changing redox conditions both groundwater p and as concentrations were higher in the transition area and the flat plain i than in the alluvial fan table s1 and fig 2g h as v reduction may be an important redox controlled process that mobilizes as under anoxic conditions in the transition area and in the flat plain i groundwater as iii concentrations increased greatly table s1 the positive correlation between increasing as iii and nh4 concentrations r 0 55 p 0 01 is indicative of as v reduction triggered by om mineralization reduction of adsorbed as v could mobilize as into groundwater which is supported by the high proportion of as iii observed in groundwater at our study sites table s1 reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides is considered to be the key redox controlled process that mobilizes p and as under anoxic conditions in this study fe iii oxides were the predominant as pool in the sediments with a mean as content of 5 84 mg kg 1 although fe iii oxides contributed less to the p pool the mean p content in fe iii oxides was 9 09 mg kg 1 table 1 both results suggest that fe iii oxides represent an important p and as host phase being able to release considerable amounts of p and as through reductive dissolution borch et al 2007 nguyen et al 2014 in the transition area and the flat plain i the significant increase in groundwater fe ii and its strong positive correlation with nh4 r 0 73 p 0 01 indicate ongoing fe iii reduction triggered by om mineralization table s1 and fig 2d although the concentrations of p and as in the flat plain were likely affected by immobilization processes as discussed in section 4 3 groundwater fe ii was still positively correlated with increasing p r 0 50 p 0 01 and as r 0 69 p 0 01 from the alluvial fan to the flat plain fig s2d e indicating the mobilization of p and as through the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides therefore in response to the changing redox conditions from oxic to fe iii reducing fe iii oxide reduction triggered by om mineralization became dominant in the mobilization and enrichment of p and as in groundwater moreover as v reduction triggered by om mineralization increased as mobility in groundwater the same mobilization processes have also been observed in floodplain aquifers in vietnam bangladesh and india islam et al 2004 cheng et al 2005 neidhardt et al 2018 4 3 p immobilization processes and competition with as under so4 2 reduction under anoxic conditions in addition to as v and fe iii reduction om mineralization may induce the reduction of so4 2 in the transition area and flat plain groundwater so4 2 cl ratios significantly decreased as shown in fig 2e as the predominant product of so4 2 reduction groundwater s2 was elevated in the transition area and the flat plain i although detectable s2 in the alluvial fan was released through the weathering of host rock sulfides in the mountainous area table s1 and fig 2f guo et al 2016b the concurrence of so4 2 and s2 indicates ongoing so4 2 reduction in the transition area and flat plain which agrees with previous studies in the hetao basin jia et al 2014 under these conditions although groundwater p and as were both mobilized by fe iii oxides reduction as previously discussed their behaviours were different as indicated by the gradually decreasing p as ratios from the transition area to the flat plain i fig 2i one possible explanation for the decreasing p as ratios is the depletion of p sources as illustrated above fe iii oxides and om are both important p sources under anoxic conditions in the flat plain i the p content in fe iii oxides in the sediments median 4 41 mg kg 1 was similar to that in the transition area median 4 99 mg kg 1 moreover the content of extractable porg in the sediment of the flat plain i median 5 38 mg kg 1 was even higher than that in the transition area median 1 57 mg kg 1 table s3 therefore we excluded the possibility of a depletion of p sources another possible explanation is the immobilization of p under anoxic conditions in the aquifers groundwater was oversaturated with siderite in the transition area and flat plain fig s3d previous sorption experiments have revealed pronounced adsorption capacities for as v and as iii on natural siderites 0 52 mg g 1 and 1 04 mg g 1 respectively guo et al 2007 whereas the adsorption capacity for po4 3 on siderites has been reported to be even higher 9 24 mg g 1 xing et al 2020 the preferential adsorption of p over as suggests that much more p would be adsorbed incorporated into the surface of siderite precipitates than as moreover in the transition area and flat plain groundwater was oversaturated with hydroxyapatite indicating the possible precipitation of ca2 and po4 3 fig s3a this is further supported by the strong positive correlation between ca and p contents in the sediments r 0 98 p 0 01 fig s4b both immobilization processes could result in p sequestration in sediments while as remains mobile in groundwater this is consistent with our observations that ca fe ii minerals were the dominant p pools in sediments and that p as ratios gradually decreased from the transition area to the flat plain i table 1 and fig 2i however these immobilization processes can not fully explain the surprising retardation of p in the flat plain i where as concentrations continuously increased fig 2g h since there was no evidence of increasing precipitation of hydroxyapatite and siderite from the transition area to the flat plain i another p immobilization process is linked to so4 2 reduction as shown by the significant decrease in groundwater s2 concentrations in the flat plain i which were positively correlated with the corresponding groundwater p concentrations and p as ratios r 0 59 and 0 48 respectively p 0 01 fig s2g as illustrated above so4 2 reduction occurred in the transition area and flat plain however the significant p 0 05 decreases in groundwater fe ii and s2 from the flat plain i to the flat plain ii and their positive correlation r 0 49 p 0 01 fig s2f indicate changing redox conditions from fe iii reduction to so4 2 reduction with possible precipitation of fe ii sulfides kirk et al 2004 wolthers et al 2005 as shown in fig s3c groundwater in the flat plain was oversaturated with fe ii sulfides the strong positive correlations among p as fe ii and s2 in the flat plain indicate immobilization of p and as via the co precipitation of fe ii sulfides fig s2d e g h previous studies have speculated that as associated with sulfides in anoxic aquifer sediments is present in the form of a sorption complex on sulfide minerals or as a minor substituent in arsenian pyrites or as newly formed ass minerals o day et al 2004 in the flat plain i the fe ii concentrations were several orders of magnitude higher than the as concentrations table s1 under fe rich conditions the threshold as concentration required to exceed ass solubility is 10 100 μm o day et al 2004 in the flat plain i comparatively low as concentrations 1 95 5 80 μm indicate that the formation of pure ass minerals was unlikely which is in line with the minor contribution of residual as to the sedimentary as pools table 1 fig 3 therefore fe ii sulfides would be the primary sulfide phase formed under so4 2 reduction and the adsorption and further substitution of as on the surfaces of fe ii sulfides would be the most significant pathway for as immobilization in the absence of ass bostick et al 2003 pi et al 2017 qiu et al 2018 however this pathway of as immobilization could be greatly affected by p firstly p likely occupies most of the adsorption sites and prevents as adsorption since po4 3 is more competitive in adsorption onto fe ii sulfides han et al 2020 this hypothesis is supported by the observation that the exchangeable as content in the sediments was several orders of magnitude lower than that of exchangeable p table 1 fig 3 this is also consistent with the negative correlation between the p as ratios and saturation indices of fes r 0 45 p 0 01 moreover adsorbed p likely effectively competes with s2 to form surface precipitates of vivianite zhang et al 2009 miot et al 2009 roussel and marquet 2016 the coating by which could prevent as substitution on fe ii sulfides this was also reflected in the groundwater where vivianite was oversaturated and its si values were negatively correlated with groundwater p as ratios r 0 49 p 0 01 figs s3b this hypothesis is further supported by a positive correlation between p and fe contents fig s4a and the p contents in ca fe ii minerals being much higher than the as contents of the sediments table 1 fig 3 therefore in fe iii reducing conditions p immobilization is mainly controlled by the formation of secondary ca fe ii minerals including hydroxyapatites siderites and vivianites once the dominant redox conditions change to so4 2 reduction the preferential adsorption and incorporation of p over as on fe ii sulfides might influence the as immobilization pathway resulting in an unexpected retardation of p and enrichment of as in groundwater in the flat plain ii the groundwater nh4 concentrations continuously increased when compared with other zones fig 2c the significant decreases in both fe ii and s2 p 0 05 and their positive correlation r 0 49 p 0 01 indicate intensive precipitation of fe ii sulfides induced by increasing om mineralization fig 2d f s2f under these conditions increasing p as ratios and their negative correlation with s2 concentrations r 0 64 p 0 01 suggest the depletion of groundwater p and immobilization of as under so4 2 reduction with a lack of p competition fig 2g h arsenic sequestration under so4 2 reduction has been previously reported in the laboratory and in floodplain aquifers of vietnam and bangladesh lowers et al 2007 kirk et al 2004 2010 stuckey et al 2015 in the hetao basin peaty layers are found in clay layers that are enriched in organic matter wang et al 2020a under reducing conditions organic matter is believed to trigger the formation of as sequestering sulfides langner et al 2011 arsenic sequestration in the forms of feass and ass was observed in the peat layers with high fe and s contents therefore the comparatively higher as and p contents in the ca fe ii minerals and residual minerals of the clay layers table 1 fig 3 suggest intensive as and p immobilization via sulfide formation sulfide formation originating from so4 2 reduction is in turn triggered by the high om contents of the clay layers immobilization of p and as is further supported by the relatively low as and p concentrations observed in groundwater adjacent to clay layers fig 3 previous studies have considered using induced sulphate reduction as a potential in situ as remediation strategy under reducing conditions keimowitz et al 2007 rodriguez freire et al 2016 based on the observations of the present study we propose that the preferential adsorption and incorporation of p over as on fe ii sulfides might influence as immobilization pathways under so4 2 reducing conditions resulting in immediate retardation of p and hysteretic immobilization of as the immobilization of p through co precipitation of fe ii sulfides in floodplain aquifers has to our knowledge not been described in the literature so far laboratory investigation of the p immobilization on fe ii sulfides and competition with as under so4 2 reducing conditions might be of great interest for the development of in situ remediation strategies for contaminated groundwater where p and as coexist and remain mobile for decades or longer 5 conclusion in the floodplain aquifers of the hetao basin inner mongolia p mobilization and immobilization processes and interactions with as under changing redox conditions were studied by systematic hydrogeochemical investigation of groundwater and complementary geochemical analysis of aquifer sediments based on our results p cycling in floodplain aquifers was tightly constrained by redox conditions under oxic suboxic conditions weathering of p bearing minerals and mineralization of om were identified as two important processes that mobilized considerable amounts of p in groundwater in response to redox conditions changing from oxic to reducing fe iii oxide reduction induced by om mineralization became the dominant process mobilizing p and as into the groundwater systems in fe iii reducing conditions ca fe ii minerals might serve as an important sink for p when the dominant redox conditions changed to so4 2 reduction the preferential adsorption and incorporation of p over as on fe ii sulfides might constrain the as immobilization pathway resulting in immediate retardation of p and hysteretic immobilization of as our study provides novel insights into the cycling of p and the enrichment of p and as in groundwater systems the findings related to interactions between p and as immobilization under so4 2 reducing conditions may help to inspire effective in situ remediation strategies for contaminated groundwater in which p

16414,increasing numbers of studies have reported groundwater with naturally high phosphorous p and arsenic as concentrations which can potentially threaten the environment and human health however the cycling of p and its interactions with as in groundwater under changing redox conditions remain largely unknown in this study 83 groundwater samples and 14 sediment samples were collected from the hetao basin inner mongolia for systematic hydrogeochemical investigation and complementary geochemical evaluation the results showed that p cycling in floodplain aquifers was tightly constrained by redox conditions under oxic suboxic conditions mineralization of organic matter and weathering of p bearing minerals were the two dominant processes that mobilized considerable amounts of p in groundwater when redox conditions became reducing fe iii oxide reduction dominated resulting in enrichment of both p and as in groundwater in fe iii reducing conditions secondary ca fe ii minerals might serve as an important sink for p when redox conditions became so4 2 reducing preferential adsorption and incorporation of p over as on fe ii sulfides might constrain the as immobilization pathway resulting in immediate retardation of p and hysteretic immobilization of as this p immobilization pathway in natural aquifers has not been described before this study provides novel insights into p cycling and as enrichment in groundwater systems understanding the roles of fe ii and s ii minerals in the immobilization of and interaction between p and as in response to so4 2 reduction may help to inspire effective in situ remediation of contaminated groundwater in which p and as coexist and remain mobile for decades or longer graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phosphorus cycling arsenic changing redox conditions mobilization competitive immobilization 1 introduction in recent years the biogeochemical cycling of phosphorus p in groundwater ecosystems has drawn increasing attention because high p groundwater may serve as an effective source of surface water and increase the risk of lake eutrophication lewandowski et al 2015 mcdowell et al 2015 meinikmann et al 2015 yu et al 2018 furthermore p plays an important role in the enrichment of toxic arsenic as in groundwater which threatens the health of people who use it for drinking and irrigation biswas et al 2014 rathi et al 2017 neidhardt et al 2021 in the floodplain and delta aquifers of many asian countries numerous studies have reported the presence of groundwater with simultaneously high concentrations of p and as mcarthur et al 2004 neidhardt et al 2018 although there has been comprehensive research on the biogeochemical cycling of as in groundwater over recent decades less is known about p mobilization and immobilization mechanisms and its interactions with as in floodplain aquifers in floodplain aquifers it is well known that the important processes underlying the mobilization of as are tightly constrained by redox conditions borch et al 2010 guo et al 2014 under oxic conditions the oxidation of pyrite is considered to be the dominant process that mobilizes as into groundwater jones and pichler 2007 when the redox conditions change from oxic to reducing the biological reduction of fe iii oxides induced by the microbial degradation of organic matter om is believed to be the major mechanism of as mobilization in the presence of fe iii reducing bacteria mcarthur et al 2004 xiu et al 2020 currently only a few studies have investigated the sources and processes of p enrichment in groundwater e g in the red river delta bengal delta and jianghan basin mcarthur et al 2004 neidhardt et al 2018 tao et al 2020 these show that om mineralization and reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides are the important processes causing p mobilization however the geochemical behaviour of p under sulphate reducing conditions remains unknown no studies have focused on the redox constraints on groundwater p cycling under changing redox conditions such information would help to understand the distinct differences between the behaviours of p and as in aquifer systems biogeochemical redox processes in groundwater systems may also immobilize p and as under anoxic conditions the sorption of dissolved as to primary and secondary minerals e g siderite vivianite metal hydr oxides clay minerals is assumed to be the main as immobilization process in floodplain aquifers robertson et al 2008 kanematsu et al 2013 dissolved p is immobilized by fe iii oxides at sediment boundaries when groundwater flows from a reducing aquifer to an oxic aquifer neidhardt et al 2018 2021 furthermore bacterial sulphate reduction is known to play a key role in the immobilization of as through the formation of ferrous sulfide minerals o day et al 2004 pi et al 2017 in the study of wang et al 2020a ferrous sulfide minerals pyrite and greigite were found in the peat layers of floodplain aquifers in the hetao basin which act as a stable sink for as under anoxic groundwater conditions however the constraint of sulphate reduction on p immobilization remains unknown in floodplain aquifers phosphate po4 3 is regarded as the dominant p species in circumneutral groundwater mcarthur et al 2004 neidhardt et al 2018 ioka et al 2021 po4 3 sorption can be strongly affected by ph and other competing oxyanions parkhurst et al 2003 at near neutral and weakly alkaline ph conditions dissolved as predominantly in the form of inorganic arsenite as iii h3aso3 and arsenate as v h2aso4 and haso4 2 is efficiently adsorbed onto aquifer sediments in the absence of po4 3 von brömssen et al 2008 biswas et al 2014 however the characteristics of competition between p and as during their immobilization via the ongoing precipitation of ferrous sulfide minerals remains unknown to conclude there is a need to closely investigate p mobilization and immobilization processes and the interaction of p with as under the changing redox conditions of floodplain aquifers this would provide novel insights into p cycling and the enrichment of p and as in groundwater systems the north western part of hetao basin inner mongolia features an obvious and characteristic hydrogeochemical zonation in its groundwater which is distributed from alluvial fans near mountains over a transition area towards a floodplain along the area of hydrogeochemical zonation the groundwater redox conditions change from oxidizing to reducing jia et al 2014 this setting provided us with the opportunity to systematically investigate the dominant im mobilization mechanisms of p and as under specific and clearly discernible redox conditions therefore the distributions of dissolved p as and other redox components were investigated in the hydrogeochemical redox zones of the study area the objectives were to 1 identify the processes that underlie p mobilization under oxidizing conditions 2 reveal the mechanisms of p and as mobilization when redox conditions change from oxic to reducing and 3 understand p immobilization processes and interactions with as under sulphate reducing conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the northwestern hetao basin inner mongolia it includes alluvial fans near mountains and a flat plain in the centre of a floodplain fig 1 to the northwest the basin is bordered by the langshan mountains which were uplifted between the jurassic and pleistocene at the southern margin of the basin the yellow river flows from west to east cao et al 2018 the hetao basin is filled with quaternary sediments of about 1500 8000 m thickness which are mainly derived from the metamorphic complex of the langshan mountains and partly from fluvial deposits of the yellow river guo et al 2008 deng et al 2009 according to borehole logging data and previous hydrogeological reports thick clay layers usually occur in the sediments at depths ranging from 39 5 to 44 1 m below land surface bls inner mongolia institute of hydrology 2014 shallow groundwater is hosted in unconfined aquifers overlying the clay layers while deep groundwater is hosted in semi confined aquifers underlying the clay layers jia et al 2014 there is a west east main drainage channel located in the north of the floodplain fig 1 to the northern side of the main drainage channel groundwater flows from the northwest to the southeast near the mountains with hydraulic conductivity that decreases from approximately 9 m d 1 to 3 8 m d 1 inner mongolia institute of hydrology 2014 gao et al 2020 in the alluvial fan near the mountains the aquifers consist of pluvial alluvial sediments whereas the aquifer sediments in the central flat plain are mainly composed of inland lacustrine sediments guo et al 2013 a transition area has been identified between the alluvial fan and flat plain which is characterized by mixed source sediment depositions guo et al 2016a gao et al 2020 to the southern side of the channel where the flat plain dominates the central floodplain the groundwater dynamics are quite complex due to the strong effects of yellow river irrigation and a dense network of drainage channels gao et al 2020 due to the different groundwater flow dynamics we differentiated the flat plain into the flat plain i near the mountains and the flat plain ii in the centre of the floodplain using the main drainage channel as the dividing line from the mountains to the centre of the floodplain the redox conditions of both the shallow and deep aquifers change from oxic to reducing with clear reduction sequences in favour of o2 no3 as v fe iii and so4 2 jia et al 2014 guo et al 2016a gao et al 2020 in general the groundwater ph is neutral to weakly alkaline from the alluvial fan near the mountains to the centre of the floodplain the groundwater is characterized by gradually increasing concentrations of fe ii nh4 s2 and as gao et al 2020 2 2 groundwater sampling and analysis in the study area 83 groundwater samples were collected from shallow and deep aquifers with depths of 10 100 m bls in june 2019 these

c until laboratory analysis details on groundwater laboratory analyses and relative analytical precision are given in the supporting information groundwater data including physicochemical parameters measured in the field and elemental concentrations analysed in the laboratory were used to calculate saturation indices si using phreeqc software v 2 thermodynamic database wateq4f this was done to identify possible mineral phases that serve as sources or sinks for p and as in the aquifers parkhurst and appelo 1999 2 3 sediment sampling and analysis two boreholes were drilled for sediment sampling in the study area k1 in the flat plain i and k2 in the transition area fig 1 fourteen sediment samples seven from k1 and seven from k2 were collected at various depths of 10 80 m bls after taken out from boreholes sediment cores were logged and split according to lithology and colur variations within several minutes then sediment sections were immediately wrapped with aluminium foil

components of these sediments are available elsewhere wang et al 2020a 2020b 2 4 statistical analysis all geochemical data were analysed using microsoft excel 2019 and spss statistical software v 25 shapiro wilk tests were used to check the normality of the datasets based on the outcomes the group means of variables from different zones and aquifers were compared using one way anova or non parametric kruskal wallis one way anova of ranks with pairwise post hoc tests lsd with significance values adjusted by bonferroni correlation the relationships between the measured variables were explored by two tailed spearman rank correlation tests the confidence interval for all tests was 95 and p values 0 05 were considered statistically significant 3 results 3 1 general groundwater chemistry the physicochemical parameters of the groundwater samples are summarized in table s1 groundwater generally had neutral to weakly alkaline ph values ranging from 6 5 to 9 1 with a median of 7

deep aquifers and increased in both from the alluvial fan to the flat plain i in the flat plain ii shallow groundwater doc remained high fig 2 a based on the variations in major cations and anions in different zones the groundwater types in shallow and deep aquifers changed from ca hco3 so4 in the alluvial fan to na cl in the flat plain i and ii fig s1 the redox conditions generally varied from oxic suboxic to anoxic orp range 172 mv to 131 mv with median orp values decreasing from the alluvial fan to the flat plain i for both shallow and deep aquifers in the flat plain ii the redox conditions of the shallow aquifer remained anoxic with a low median orp value table s1 fig 2b in the alluvial fan the median concentrations of no3 in shallow and deep groundwater were 1 06 mg l 1 and 1 53 mg l 1 respectively while they both decreased to 0 01 mg l 1 in the transition area and flat plain table s1 although groundwater nh4 was significantly higher p 0 05 in the deep aquifer than in the shallow aquifer in the transition area and in the flat plain i groundwater nh4 in both aquifers increased along the groundwater flow path fig 2c in the flat plain ii shallow groundwater nh4 kept increasing to the median of 4 23 mg l 1 groundwater fe ii presented a significant increase from the alluvial fan to the flat plain i for both aquifers in the shallow aquifer of the flat plain ii groundwater fe ii concentrations were low with a median of 0 62 mg l 1 table s1 fig 2d groundwater so4 2 had a wide range of 13 1 1473 mg l 1 in the two aquifers table s1 to eliminate the effect of evaporation the so4 2 cl ratio was used as a substitute for so4 2 concentration jia et al 2014 guo et al 2016a as shown in fig 2e the so4 2 cl ratios in both aquifers decreased from the alluvial fan to the flat plain i in the flat plain ii the shallow groundwater so4 2 cl ratio was even lower with a median of 0 50 from the alluvial fan to the transition area groundwater s2 concentrations increased in both aquifers however the median concentrations of s2 in the two aquifers decreased significantly from the transition area to the flat plain i p 0 05 in the flat plain ii groundwater s2 kept decreasing reaching a minimum in the shallow aquifer table s1 fig 2f 3 2 groundwater p and as concentrations groundwater p ranged from 15 0 μg l 1 to 221 μg l 1 with a median of 86 8 μg l 1 more than 70 of the groundwater samples had p concentrations exceeding 50 μg l 1 in the alluvial fan the concentrations of p in both aquifers were lower than in other zones in the transition area although groundwater p in the deep aquifer was higher than that in the shallow aquifer they both increased reaching the highest concentrations however the increases in groundwater p in the two aquifers were retarded in the flat plain i where shallow groundwater p remained steady and deep groundwater p decreased significantly p 0 05 fig 2g in the flat plain ii shallow groundwater p decreased to a low median value the different p species found in the groundwater are shown in table s1 these results show that tdp accounted for 93 3 n 83 standard error 1 81 of the corresponding tp concentration indicating that dissolved p is the dominant species moreover 67 of the 83 groundwater samples had po4 3 concentrations 85 of the corresponding tdp concentration showing that dissolved po4 3 is the dominant form of p in the groundwater groundwater as concentrations ranged from 0 40 μg l 1 to 435 μg l 1 with a median of 67 9 μg l 1 more than 90 of the groundwater samples exceeded an as concentration of 10 μg l 1 the lowest as concentrations were also found in the alluvial fan in both aquifers groundwater as in both aquifers increased significantly from the alluvial fan through the transition area to the flat plain i in the flat plain ii the shallow groundwater as decreased to a low median value fig 2h the observed as species including as iii and as v are shown in table s1 as iii was the major as species accounting for 60 of the total as in the investigated groundwater while as v typically accounted for 40 no organic as species were detected such as monomethylarsonic acid mma and dimethylarsinic acid dma groundwater p as ratios ranged from 0 10 to 17 8 with a median of 1 42 the highest groundwater p as ratios were observed in the alluvial fan in both aquifers in the transition area groundwater p as ratios in both aquifers decreased significantly and kept decreasing to a minimum in the flat plain i in the flat plain ii the p as ratio of shallow groundwater had a low median value but was higher than that in the adjacent flat plain i fig 2i groundwater p concentrations were positively correlated with groundwater fe ii r 0 50 p 0 01 and s2 r 0 59 p 0 01 and

negative correlation with orp r 0 49 p 0 01 fig s2c and a positive correlation with doc r 0 73 p 0 01 moreover from the transition area to the flat plain i both the groundwater p as ratios and s2 concentrations decreased and were positively correlated r 0 48 p 0 01 however they were negatively correlated r 0 64 p 0 01 from the flat plain i to the flat plain ii where the groundwater p as ratios increased while s2 concentrations decreased additionally thermodynamic calculations demonstrated that groundwater in the alluvial fan was unsaturated with respect to hydroxyapatite vivianite siderite and fes approaching the centre of the floodplain these minerals became oversaturated in the transition area and flat plain fig s3 from the alluvial fan to the flat plain groundwater p as ratios were negatively correlated with the saturation indices of fes r 0 45 p 0 01 and vivianite r 0 49 p 0 01 descriptions of the mineral saturation indices are provided in the supporting information 3 3 sediment geochemistry and p and as pools the aquifer sediments in drilling cores k1 and k2 mainly consisted of silt to fine sand covered by silty clay or clay layers at depths of approximately 0 10 m bls at about 40 m bls a clay layer separated the upper unconfined aquifer and lower semi confined aquifer fig 3 table s2 lists the bulk contents of the major metal components and tp of the aquifer sediments there were higher contents of ca al and fe than mg and mn in the sediments the mean sediment as contents was 8 20 mg kg 1 n 14 with a range of 3 27 18 4 mg kg 1 the mean tp content was 326 mg kg 1 n 14 with a range of 200 600 mg kg 1 the tp contents in the sediments had strong positive correlations with as r 0 89 ca r 0 98 and fe r 0 98 p 0 01 fig s4 sediment total p and as contents were generally dependent on the lithological characteristics high p and as contents were mostly found in clay silty clay layers at the depths of 15 7 and 40 0 m in drilling core k1 and 65 4 m in k2 with mean values of 515 and 17 2 mg kg 1 respectively n 3 fig 3 in the sand silt layers p and as contents were comparatively low with mean values of 274 and 6 55 mg kg 1 n 11 accordingly groundwater sampled adjacent to clay silty clay layers generally had lower p and as concentrations than that sampled from other depths in the two drilling wells fig 3 the results of the sedimentary p and as pools are shown in table 1 and fig 3 ca fe ii minerals represented the dominant p pool with a mean portion of 91 2 n 14 of total extractable p exchangeable p and p in fe iii oxides only contributed small proportions to the overall p pool relative proportions of 4 12 and 2 84 respectively strongly sorbed p and residual p remained low organic p porg contents from the first two steps of the sequential extraction were calculated as the differences between tp and po4 3 contents only in the exchangeable p pool were porg contents mostly detectable as shown in table s3 in drilling core k2 which was located in the transition area the median extractable porg content in the exchangeable p pool was 1 57 mg kg 1 while in k1 from the flat plain it increased to 5 38 mg kg 1 in the depth profile there was much more extractable porg in the clay silty clay layers mean content 13 7 mg kg 1 n 3 than in the sand silt layers mean content 2 09 mg kg 1 n 11 fig 3 fe iii oxides were the predominant as pool with a mean portion of 61 1 n 14 strongly sorbed as occupied a mean portion of 23 5 of the total extractable as residual as and as in ca fe ii minerals made minor contribution to the overall p pool relative proportions of 8 10 and 6 67 respectively exchangeable as was low in the depth profile the different sedimentary p and as pools were all higher in clay silty clay layers than in sand silt layers table 1 fig 3 4 discussion from the alluvial fan to the flat plain both groundwater doc and nh4 concentrations increased significantly p 0 05 figs 2a 2c this positive correlation r 0 73 p 0 01 indicates a gradual increase in om degradation towards the centre of the floodplain this corresponds with the study of zhou et al 2018 who demonstrated om degradation along a flow path by groundwater stable carbon isotope analysis in aquifers om degradation may serve as electron donor that rapidly deplete oxygen and change the redox conditions stumm and sulzberger 1992 along the flow path groundwater orp gradually decreased and was negatively correlated with nh4 concentrations r 0 48 p 0 01 fig s2c indicating changing redox conditions induced by om degradation the negative correlations of groundwater orp with p and with as figs s2a b suggest the cycling of p in particular the im mobilization of p is tightly constrained by redox conditions being similar to as accordingly the im mobilization mechanisms of p and its interactions with as in groundwater under changing redox conditions are discussed below 4 1 processes mobilizing p under oxic suboxic conditions in the alluvial fan near the mountains the median groundwater orp 29 6 mv and maximum orp 131 mv suggest that the aquifers have oxic suboxic conditions table s1 in the groundwater of the hetao basin degradation of microbially mediated om including organic nitrogen is the primary contributor to nh4 release gao et al 2021 under oxic conditions high no3 concentrations in the alluvial fan table s1 may result from the oxidation of nh4 via nitrification processes kelley et al 2013 xiu et al 2021 from the alluvial fan to the transition area the gradually decreasing orp and no3 values table s1 and fig 2b indicate an ongoing process of no3 reduction via heterotrophic denitrification ortmeyer et al 2021 under these conditions as concentrations were generally low but considerable p concentrations occurred in the groundwater resulting in relatively high p as ratios in the alluvial fan fig 2g h i one possible explanation for the p mobilization in the alluvial fan is the weathering of p containing minerals originating from the adjacent metamorphic complex of the langshan mountains guo et al 2016a reported p contents exceeding 1000 mg kg 1 in metamorphic and sedimentary rocks of the langshan mountains including schists and carbonatites moreover a high hydraulic conductivity of 9 m d 1 has been reported which is evidence of pronounced weathering impacts in this area institute of hydrogeology and environmental geology 2014 this explanation is further supported by the groundwater observed in the present study which was unsaturated with respect to hydroxyapatite and vivianite two principal p containing minerals table s1 and fig s3a b weathering of these minerals increases the dissolved p in groundwater as reported elsewhere edmunds et al 2013 flower et al 2016 schafer et al 2018 another potential mobilization mechanism for p is the mineralization of om in aquifers in the alluvial fan doc median 2 35 mg l 1 and high sedimentary om contents median 2 33 g kg 1 guo et al 2019 may serve as sources for microbial degradation processes in groundwater ecosystems nh4 mainly originates from the mineralization of n containing om and thus represents a useful indicator of om degradation rivett et al 2008 du et al 2020 in the alluvial fan and in the transition area po4 3 was the dominant p species in groundwater table s1 increases in nh4 and p concentrations from the alluvial fan to the transition area and their positive correlation r 0 58 p 0 01 fig s2i suggest that ongoing om mineralization is an important groundwater p mobilization process in the form of po4 3 in these two zones table s1 and fig 2c g desorption of po4 3 at high phs may be another cause of p mobilization under oxic suboxic conditions in floodplain aquifers when the ph exceeds 6 8 the adsorption capacity of po4 3 on fe iii oxides sharply decreases as a result of oh competitive adsorption zhou et al 2005 thereby mobilizing po4 3 into groundwater huang et al 2020 in the study area groundwater occurred in neutral weakly alkaline conditions with high phs table s1 high phs also drastically decrease as adsorption on fe iii oxides resulting in high as concentrations podgorski et al 2017 however less as was observed in the groundwater of the alluvial fan furthermore there was no significant correlation between groundwater p concentrations and ph suggesting that the desorption of po4 3 at high phs only plays a minor role in p mobilization in this area therefore under oxic suboxic conditions in the alluvial fan weathering of p bearing minerals and mineralization of om were the two important processes that mobilized considerable amounts of p into groundwater 4 2 processes mobilizing both p and as under anoxic conditions in the transition area and flat plain there were low negative orp values and a negative correlation between nh4 concentrations and orps fig 2b c s2c r 0 48 p 0 01 this suggests that the redox conditions changing from oxic into anoxic is due to increasing om mineralization in response to the changing redox conditions both groundwater p and as concentrations were higher in the transition area and the flat plain i than in the alluvial fan table s1 and fig 2g h as v reduction may be an important redox controlled process that mobilizes as under anoxic conditions in the transition area and in the flat plain i groundwater as iii concentrations increased greatly table s1 the positive correlation between increasing as iii and nh4 concentrations r 0 55 p 0 01 is indicative of as v reduction triggered by om mineralization reduction of adsorbed as v could mobilize as into groundwater which is supported by the high proportion of as iii observed in groundwater at our study sites table s1 reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides is considered to be the key redox controlled process that mobilizes p and as under anoxic conditions in this study fe iii oxides were the predominant as pool in the sediments with a mean as content of 5 84 mg kg 1 although fe iii oxides contributed less to the p pool the mean p content in fe iii oxides was 9 09 mg kg 1 table 1 both results suggest that fe iii oxides represent an important p and as host phase being able to release considerable amounts of p and as through reductive dissolution borch et al 2007 nguyen et al 2014 in the transition area and the flat plain i the significant increase in groundwater fe ii and its strong positive correlation with nh4 r 0 73 p 0 01 indicate ongoing fe iii reduction triggered by om mineralization table s1 and fig 2d although the concentrations of p and as in the flat plain were likely affected by immobilization processes as discussed in section 4 3 groundwater fe ii was still positively correlated with increasing p r 0 50 p 0 01 and as r 0 69 p 0 01 from the alluvial fan to the flat plain fig s2d e indicating the mobilization of p and as through the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides therefore in response to the changing redox conditions from oxic to fe iii reducing fe iii oxide reduction triggered by om mineralization became dominant in the mobilization and enrichment of p and as in groundwater moreover as v reduction triggered by om mineralization increased as mobility in groundwater the same mobilization processes have also been observed in floodplain aquifers in vietnam bangladesh and india islam et al 2004 cheng et al 2005 neidhardt et al 2018 4 3 p immobilization processes and competition with as under so4 2 reduction under anoxic conditions in addition to as v and fe iii reduction om mineralization may induce the reduction of so4 2 in the transition area and flat plain groundwater so4 2 cl ratios significantly decreased as shown in fig 2e as the predominant product of so4 2 reduction groundwater s2 was elevated in the transition area and the flat plain i although detectable s2 in the alluvial fan was released through the weathering of host rock sulfides in the mountainous area table s1 and fig 2f guo et al 2016b the concurrence of so4 2 and s2 indicates ongoing so4 2 reduction in the transition area and flat plain which agrees with previous studies in the hetao basin jia et al 2014 under these conditions although groundwater p and as were both mobilized by fe iii oxides reduction as previously discussed their behaviours were different as indicated by the gradually decreasing p as ratios from the transition area to the flat plain i fig 2i one possible explanation for the decreasing p as ratios is the depletion of p sources as illustrated above fe iii oxides and om are both important p sources under anoxic conditions in the flat plain i the p content in fe iii oxides in the sediments median 4 41 mg kg 1 was similar to that in the transition area median 4 99 mg kg 1 moreover the content of extractable porg in the sediment of the flat plain i median 5 38 mg kg 1 was even higher than that in the transition area median 1 57 mg kg 1 table s3 therefore we excluded the possibility of a depletion of p sources another possible explanation is the immobilization of p under anoxic conditions in the aquifers groundwater was oversaturated with siderite in the transition area and flat plain fig s3d previous sorption experiments have revealed pronounced adsorption capacities for as v and as iii on natural siderites 0 52 mg g 1 and 1 04 mg g 1 respectively guo et al 2007 whereas the adsorption capacity for po4 3 on siderites has been reported to be even higher 9 24 mg g 1 xing et al 2020 the preferential adsorption of p over as suggests that much more p would be adsorbed incorporated into the surface of siderite precipitates than as moreover in the transition area and flat plain groundwater was oversaturated with hydroxyapatite indicating the possible precipitation of ca2 and po4 3 fig s3a this is further supported by the strong positive correlation between ca and p contents in the sediments r 0 98 p 0 01 fig s4b both immobilization processes could result in p sequestration in sediments while as remains mobile in groundwater this is consistent with our observations that ca fe ii minerals were the dominant p pools in sediments and that p as ratios gradually decreased from the transition area to the flat plain i table 1 and fig 2i however these immobilization processes can not fully explain the surprising retardation of p in the flat plain i where as concentrations continuously increased fig 2g h since there was no evidence of increasing precipitation of hydroxyapatite and siderite from the transition area to the flat plain i another p immobilization process is linked to so4 2 reduction as shown by the significant decrease in groundwater s2 concentrations in the flat plain i which were positively correlated with the corresponding groundwater p concentrations and p as ratios r 0 59 and 0 48 respectively p 0 01 fig s2g as illustrated above so4 2 reduction occurred in the transition area and flat plain however the significant p 0 05 decreases in groundwater fe ii and s2 from the flat plain i to the flat plain ii and their positive correlation r 0 49 p 0 01 fig s2f indicate changing redox conditions from fe iii reduction to so4 2 reduction with possible precipitation of fe ii sulfides kirk et al 2004 wolthers et al 2005 as shown in fig s3c groundwater in the flat plain was oversaturated with fe ii sulfides the strong positive correlations among p as fe ii and s2 in the flat plain indicate immobilization of p and as via the co precipitation of fe ii sulfides fig s2d e g h previous studies have speculated that as associated with sulfides in anoxic aquifer sediments is present in the form of a sorption complex on sulfide minerals or as a minor substituent in arsenian pyrites or as newly formed ass minerals o day et al 2004 in the flat plain i the fe ii concentrations were several orders of magnitude higher than the as concentrations table s1 under fe rich conditions the threshold as concentration required to exceed ass solubility is 10 100 μm o day et al 2004 in the flat plain i comparatively low as concentrations 1 95 5 80 μm indicate that the formation of pure ass minerals was unlikely which is in line with the minor contribution of residual as to the sedimentary as pools table 1 fig 3 therefore fe ii sulfides would be the primary sulfide phase formed under so4 2 reduction and the adsorption and further substitution of as on the surfaces of fe ii sulfides would be the most significant pathway for as immobilization in the absence of ass bostick et al 2003 pi et al 2017 qiu et al 2018 however this pathway of as immobilization could be greatly affected by p firstly p likely occupies most of the adsorption sites and prevents as adsorption since po4 3 is more competitive in adsorption onto fe ii sulfides han et al 2020 this hypothesis is supported by the observation that the exchangeable as content in the sediments was several orders of magnitude lower than that of exchangeable p table 1 fig 3 this is also consistent with the negative correlation between the p as ratios and saturation indices of fes r 0 45 p 0 01 moreover adsorbed p likely effectively competes with s2 to form surface precipitates of vivianite zhang et al 2009 miot et al 2009 roussel and marquet 2016 the coating by which could prevent as substitution on fe ii sulfides this was also reflected in the groundwater where vivianite was oversaturated and its si values were negatively correlated with groundwater p as ratios r 0 49 p 0 01 figs s3b this hypothesis is further supported by a positive correlation between p and fe contents fig s4a and the p contents in ca fe ii minerals being much higher than the as contents of the sediments table 1 fig 3 therefore in fe iii reducing conditions p immobilization is mainly controlled by the formation of secondary ca fe ii minerals including hydroxyapatites siderites and vivianites once the dominant redox conditions change to so4 2 reduction the preferential adsorption and incorporation of p over as on fe ii sulfides might influence the as immobilization pathway resulting in an unexpected retardation of p and enrichment of as in groundwater in the flat plain ii the groundwater nh4 concentrations continuously increased when compared with other zones fig 2c the significant decreases in both fe ii and s2 p 0 05 and their positive correlation r 0 49 p 0 01 indicate intensive precipitation of fe ii sulfides induced by increasing om mineralization fig 2d f s2f under these conditions increasing p as ratios and their negative correlation with s2 concentrations r 0 64 p 0 01 suggest the depletion of groundwater p and immobilization of as under so4 2 reduction with a lack of p competition fig 2g h arsenic sequestration under so4 2 reduction has been previously reported in the laboratory and in floodplain aquifers of vietnam and bangladesh lowers et al 2007 kirk et al 2004 2010 stuckey et al 2015 in the hetao basin peaty layers are found in clay layers that are enriched in organic matter wang et al 2020a under reducing conditions organic matter is believed to trigger the formation of as sequestering sulfides langner et al 2011 arsenic sequestration in the forms of feass and ass was observed in the peat layers with high fe and s contents therefore the comparatively higher as and p contents in the ca fe ii minerals and residual minerals of the clay layers table 1 fig 3 suggest intensive as and p immobilization via sulfide formation sulfide formation originating from so4 2 reduction is in turn triggered by the high om contents of the clay layers immobilization of p and as is further supported by the relatively low as and p concentrations observed in groundwater adjacent to clay layers fig 3 previous studies have considered using induced sulphate reduction as a potential in situ as remediation strategy under reducing conditions keimowitz et al 2007 rodriguez freire et al 2016 based on the observations of the present study we propose that the preferential adsorption and incorporation of p over as on fe ii sulfides might influence as immobilization pathways under so4 2 reducing conditions resulting in immediate retardation of p and hysteretic immobilization of as the immobilization of p through co precipitation of fe ii sulfides in floodplain aquifers has to our knowledge not been described in the literature so far laboratory investigation of the p immobilization on fe ii sulfides and competition with as under so4 2 reducing conditions might be of great interest for the development of in situ remediation strategies for contaminated groundwater where p and as coexist and remain mobile for decades or longer 5 conclusion in the floodplain aquifers of the hetao basin inner mongolia p mobilization and immobilization processes and interactions with as under changing redox conditions were studied by systematic hydrogeochemical investigation of groundwater and complementary geochemical analysis of aquifer sediments based on our results p cycling in floodplain aquifers was tightly constrained by redox conditions under oxic suboxic conditions weathering of p bearing minerals and mineralization of om were identified as two important processes that mobilized considerable amounts of p in groundwater in response to redox conditions changing from oxic to reducing fe iii oxide reduction induced by om mineralization became the dominant process mobilizing p and as into the groundwater systems in fe iii reducing conditions ca fe ii minerals might serve as an important sink for p when the dominant redox conditions changed to so4 2 reduction the preferential adsorption and incorporation of p over as on fe ii sulfides might constrain the as immobilization pathway resulting in immediate retardation of p and hysteretic immobilization of as our study provides novel insights into the cycling of p and the enrichment of p and as in groundwater systems the findings related to interactions between p and as immobilization under so4 2 reducing conditions may help to inspire effective in situ remediation strategies for contaminated groundwater in which p
