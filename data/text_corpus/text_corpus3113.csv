15565,irrigation with reclaimed wastewater is a growing practice aimed at conserving freshwater sources especially in arid and semiarid regions despite the apparent advantages to water management the practice of irrigation with reclaimed wastewater exposes the agroenvironment to contaminants of emerging concern cecs in this report we estimated the unintentional dietary exposure of the israeli population 2808 participants to cecs from consumption of produce irrigated with reclaimed wastewater using detailed dietary data obtained from a national health and nutrition survey rav mabat adults 2014 2016 human health risk analyses were conducted based on acceptable daily intake adi and threshold of toxicological concern ttc approaches the highest unintentional exposure to wastewater borne cecs was found to occur through the consumption of leafy vegetables all analyzed cecs exhibited hazard quotients 1 for the mean and high exposure scenarios indicating no human health concerns however for the extreme exposure scenario the anticonvulsant agents lamotrigine and carbamazepine and the carbamazepine metabolite epoxide carbamazepine exhibited the highest exposure levels of 29 100 27 200 and 19 500 ng person 70 kg per day respectively these exposure levels exceeded the ttc of lamotrigine and the metabolite epoxide carbamazepine and the adi of carbamazepine resulting in hazard quotients of 2 8 1 1 and 1 9 respectively according to the extreme estimated scenario consumption of produce irrigated with reclaimed wastewater leafy vegetables in particular may pose a threat to human health minimizing irrigation of leafy vegetables using reclaimed wastewater and or improving the quality of the reclaimed wastewater using an advanced treatment would significantly reduce human dietary exposure to cecs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hazard quotient pharmaceutical risk assessment treated wastewater agriculture abbreviations cecs contaminants of emerging concern adi acceptable daily intake ttc threshold of toxicological concern data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the agricultural sector accounts for about a third of the global land surface consumes about 70 of the available water and uses hundreds of millions of tons of chemicals and nutrients annually fao 2021 2020 2019 the global water shortage has led to increased demand for reclaimed wastewater as an essential water source for crop irrigation whereas in temperate climate zones reclaimed wastewater is minimally used for crop irrigation in arid and semiarid climatic regions reclaimed wastewater is often used aquastat 1999 in california and china about 46 and 33 of the produced effluents respectively are applied to agricultural lands sato et al 2013 wang et al 2017 in israel about 85 of the wastewater effluents are reclaimed and used for crop irrigation accounting for 50 of the total water used by the agriculture sector fu et al 2019 goldstein et al 2014 on a global scale irrigation with reclaimed wastewater is expected to increase to compensate for growing water shortages driven by climate change and an increasing human population hristov et al 2021 despite its evident advantages for water management sewage reclamation exposes the agricultural environment to a wide range of pollutants that are not fully removed during the wastewater treatment process these include heavy metals endocrine disrupting chemicals perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances microplastics personal care products pharmaceuticals hormones and antibiotics alygizakis et al 2020 collivignarelli et al 2019 de santiago martín et al 2020 garcía et al 2020 lasee et al 2017 lenka et al 2021 merino et al 2016 wilkinson et al 2022 regulation concerning irrigation with reclaimed wastewater differs among countries and states according to the world health organization who 2006 the health hazards associated with the use of reclaimed wastewater in the agricultural sector are pathogens vector borne diseases and some micropollutants thus who guidelines call for combining health protection measures such as wastewater treatment washing the produce and use of drip or subsurface irrigation and escherichia coli measurements for unrestricted irrigation e coli levels should not exceed 103 and 104 cfu per 100 ml for root and leaf crops respectively and should surpass the pathogen reduction requirement according to health protection measures according to the european union eu 2020 starting in 2023 unrestricted irrigation will only be permitted for disinfected and filtered wastewater that has undergone secondary treatment and that the e coli levels will have to be 10 cfu 100 ml bod5 and tss levels 10 mg l and turbidity 5 ntu the us environmental protection agency us epa 2012 suggests three categories for agricultural reuse of wastewater food crops processed food crops and non food crops for food crops only disinfected and filtered secondary treated reclaimed wastewater post activated sludge trickling filters rotating biological contractors or stabilization pond systems is permitted with an e coli level 14 cfu 100 ml bod5 10 mg l turbidity 2 or 5 ntu depending on filtration type and a minimum of 1 mg l residual cl2 several states in the us use stricter regulations for example florida nevada and virginia allow irrigation with reclaimed wastewater only if the crop is peeled or processed before consumption and do not allow contact between the irrigation water and crops that are consumed fresh california allows irrigation of crops that are in contact with the irrigation water only if the turbidity level is 2 ntu california water board 2018 us epa 2012 in israel restrictions on the use of reclaimed wastewater for irrigation are based on crop type edible processed or non edible irrigation water quality the distance of the edible organ from the irrigation water and reduction of disease agents inbar 2007 for unrestricted irrigation only high quality reclaimed wastewater filtered and disinfected secondary treated wastewater with e coli level 10 cfu 100 ml bod5 10 mg l tss 10 mg l cod 100 mg l total nitrogen 25 mg l and total phosphorus 5 mg l can be used the above regulations lack references for maximal levels of bioactive molecules such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products miarov et al 2020 miller et al 2018 to date only switzerland and california have taken systematic legal measures to regulate and reduce pharmaceutical residues in the environment miarov et al 2020 according to the california water board 2013 caffeine triclosan gemfibrozil and iopromide should be monitored in reclaimed wastewater destined for groundwater and should not exceed 0 05 µg l or 0 001 µg l in the case of gemfibrozil monitoring requirements are likely to be incorporated into california s future regulations and standards for direct reuse miarov et al 2020 olivieri et al 2016 in switzerland 13 pharmaceuticals are routinely monitored for potable water reuse however no attention has been given to agricultural water reuse in addition in 2016 new regulations were implemented to upgrade about 100 of switzerland s municipal wastewater treatment plants for the removal of micropollutants over 20 years aqua strategy 2016 miarov et al 2020 the human health risk associated with exposure to pharmaceuticals and other cecs can be assessed using two main approaches acceptable daily intake adi kumar and xagoraraki 2010 liu et al 2020 prosser and sibley 2015 and threshold of toxicological concern ttc kroes et al 2004 malchi et al 2014 meffe et al 2021a the adi value represents the daily intake of a substance that does not result in any adverse health effects to potentially exposed populations including all sensitive sub populations schwab et al 2005 adi values are calculated based on experimental data and include the point of departure i e the lowest observed dose the duration of exposure an uncertainty factor that takes into account inter and intraspecies variability and extrapolation from a low observable adverse effect level to no observable adverse effect level bercu et al 2008 kumar and xagoraraki 2010 the ttc is classified into three levels i ii and iii i e 30 9 and 1 5 µg kg body weight per day respectively based on the chemical structure of the molecule kroes et al 2005 class i compounds are easily metabolized thus presenting low toxicity concerns class ii compounds contain structures that may be more harmful than class i but do not contain structural elements that are indicative of toxicity class iii compounds contain reactive functional groups and raise higher toxicity concerns the highest concern is for potentially genotoxic compounds which may interact with dna and cause mutations in the genetic code kroes et al 2005 more et al 2019 to date only limited information is available regarding comprehensive dietary exposure to wastewater derived cecs and the associated risk for humans riemenschneider et al 2016 estimated that exposure to the anticonvulsant agent carbamazepine may reach tens of nanograms per kilogram body weight daily based on the consumption of potatoes and leafy vegetables similarly tadić et al 2021 suggested that the highest exposure to antibiotics which may also reach tens of nanograms per kilogram body weight daily is due to consumption of tomatoes liu et al 2020 concluded that human exposure to antibiotics does not exceed a few nanograms per kilogram body weight per day maximum of 5 ng kg body weight per day of triclosan these studies concluded that daily exposure to cecs via consumption of fresh produce irrigated with reclaimed wastewater does not exceed the hazard thresholds i e adi or ttc however meffe et al 2021a reported that additional toxicity tests are recommended for some genotoxic compounds found in maize irrigated with reclaimed wastewater in addition malchi et al 2014 suggested that carrot consumption of 700 g may exceed the ttc level of the carbamazepine metabolite epoxide carbamazepine for a 70 kg person however all the aforementioned studies are limited by the relatively little number of crops tested and small sample sizes in the paper by ben mordechay et al 2021 we provided data from a national survey of cecs occurrence and concentration in commercial produce collected from 445 fields irrigated with reclaimed wastewater in israel here we combine the cec concentration data in fresh produce with dietary consumption habits to provide comprehensive exposure assessments and the associated human health concerns for a realistic scenario of intensive crop irrigation with reclaimed wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant samples plant samples were collected from 469 groves and fields in israel from 2017 to 2021 ben mordechay et al 2021 that had been irrigated with reclaimed wastewater for 1 to 35 years median of 20 years eleven crops were sampled in this study leafy vegetables 64 fields carrot 43 fields orange 55 groves tangerine 63 groves tomato 43 fields potato 49 fields avocado 71 groves banana 57 groves apple 11 groves onion 9 fields and pepper 4 fields all crops were collected a few days before harvest from 10 to15 plants surrounding the center of the field in the case of fruits sampling was conducted from 6 to 8 trees located around the center of the grove in all cases fruits leaves or other plant organs collected from the same grove or field were mixed in the laboratory to obtain a single composite sample representing a single field or grove crops were selected to represent a variety of edible organs roots carrot leaves leafy vegetables fruit orange tangerine avocado banana apple pepper and tomato tuber potato and bulb onion based on their dominance in reclaimed wastewater irrigated fields and groves in israel a stratified sampling method was used to sample each crop according to its reclaimed wastewater irrigation cultivation area in israel additional information regarding the calculation of sample size for each crop and the stratifying sampling method is presented in ben mordechay et al 2021 in addition to the sampled crops additional data regarding the cecs carbamazepine the carbamazepine metabolites epoxide carbamazepine and dihydroxy carbamazepine lamotrigine trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole and caffeine in zucchini and eggplant were added based on published data goldstein et al 2014 riemenschneider et al 2016 2 2 plant sample preparation and analysis the

curves determination of lod chromatographic separation elution and elution gradient injection volumes mass spectrometer operation modes and ion source parameters are presented in ben mordechay et al 2021 crop samples irrigated with fresh water free of cecs were used as field blanks 2 3 consumption habits survey design and population data on the dietary consumption habits of the israeli population were obtained and analyzed from the 2nd israeli national health and nutrition survey the survey was carried out during 2014 2016 by the israel center for disease control the nutrition division of the israeli ministry of health and the israel central bureau of statistics and received approval from the ethics committee of the israeli ministry of health the survey s design questionnaires and operation are described in the israel center for disease control 2019 website a total of 2957 adults aged 18 64 years were interviewed face to face with a focus on food intake assessed using the 24 h recall method baranowski 2013 in addition to demographics health status and lifestyle characteristics complete recall data were obtained for 2808 of the survey participants 95 and were analyzed in the current study fig s1 demographic lifestyle and nutritional intake characteristics are presented in the supporting information and table s2 2 4 data and statistical analysis for statistical analysis of the cec levels in the produce concentrations below the lod not detected were reported as 0 zero concentration for concentrations between the lod and loq the reported concentration was loq 2 concentrations above the loq were reported as is the cross sectional consumption habits survey targeted participants based on weighting factors provided by the israel central bureau of statistics weighted sampling analysis was used to analyze the characteristics of the study participants statistical analyses were performed using the sas access 9 4 interface to adabas reference manual sas institute cary nc 2 5 human exposure and health risk assessment the estimated daily dietary exposures for each cec were calculated by multiplying the consumption values mean or 95th percentiles of each fruit or vegetable g fresh produce person per day by the concentration mean or maximum of the cec in the fresh produce ng cec g fresh produce the health risks associated with dietary exposure were assessed using both adi and ttc approaches the ttc classification was determined using toxtree software patlewicz et al 2008 adi and ttc levels are presented in table s3 human health concerns were calculated by estimating the hazard quotient which is the ratio between the dietary exposure value of each cec and its adi or ttc level a hazard quotient 1 suggests a potential human health concern due to high chronic exposure 3 results and discussion israel is considered a pioneer in the reuse of reclaimed wastewater in the agricultural sector constituting more than half of the water used for crop irrigation fu et al 2019 schacht et al 2016 here we provide a comprehensive estimation of the exposure level of the israeli population and various subgroups males females vegetarians arabs and jews to cecs based on fresh produce consumption ages 18 64 years table 1 and cec concentration in the produce tables s4 s14 3 1 population characteristics and produce consumption a total of 2808 israeli adults 50 males aged in average 40 13 years were included in a national representative dietary survey table s2 icdc 2019 the sample was predominately jewish 80 and about 50 of the participants had post secondary education the body mass index bmi of about 50 of the males and 50 of the females was within the normal weight range bmi of 18 5 24 9 35 and 25 were overweight bmi of 25 0 30 0 respectively 30 were obese bmi 30 and the rest were underweight 5 bmi 18 5 for comparison in the us 79 of the adults aged 20 74 years are overweight including 48 obese fryar et al 2018 and in europe about 50 of the population is overweight eurostat 2019 the median daily energy intake was 1525 kcal and macronutrient energy values as percentages of energy intake were within the acceptable macronutrient distribution ranges based on the dietary reference intake recommendations trumbo et al 2002 vegetarians made up 4 of the participants this is in agreement with the israeli central bureau of statistics data of vegetarians being 4 7 of the israeli population cbs 2014 in germany italy spain and the us vegetarians constitute 5 6 5 and 5 respectively of the general population based on a web questionnaire statista 2018 according to the survey the mean daily consumption sd of fruit and vegetables was 121 163 and 235 173 g person respectively and the mean total produce consumption was 356 238 g person per day in comparison the mean daily intakes of fresh fruit in europe and the us are 141 and 140 g person and of fresh vegetables 173 and 190 g person respectively efsa 2021 usda 2021 this implies a mean consumption of 314 and 330 g person per day of fresh produce in europe and the us respectively in france greece italy and spain countries that share a mediterranean diet similar to that in israel the mean daily consumption of fruit and vegetables is 145 and 236 121 and 192 190 and 241 and 155 and 144 g person respectively efsa 2021 tomato is the most consumed crop by the israeli population with a mean consumption of 68 94 g person per day which accounts for almost 20 of the daily consumption of fruit and vegetables table 1 similarly in the eu tomato is the most consumed fruit among fruit and vegetables with a mean daily intake of about 38 g person valumics 2021 israeli vegetarians consumed the largest amount of fruit and vegetables 457 258 g person per day compared to the other population subgroups males females arabs and jews 360 252 355 224 343 252 and 361 235 g person per day respectively table s15 vegetarians also exhibited the highest mean and 95th percentile consumption of almost all individual crops i e tomatoes apples potatoes cucumbers etc interestingly the arab population 20 of the israeli population exhibited the highest mean and 95th percentile consumption of leafy vegetables 33 63 and 179 g person per day respectively the consumption of leafy vegetables by vegetarians according to the survey mean and 95th percentile consumption was 28 53 and 121 g person per day respectively the importance of leafy vegetables consumption will be further discussed 3 2 cecs in edible produce the data presented in this report for pharmaceuticals and other cecs in crops account for 78 of the daily consumption of fresh produce by the israeli population table 1 moreover the dataset includes various plant organs fruit tomato avocado banana apple pepper tangerine and orange leaves leafy vegetables root carrot tuber potato and bulb onion of the 59 cecs analyzed table s1 26 were detected in at least one of the crops tables s4 s14 leafy vegetables exhibited the highest number of detectable cecs 18 as well as the highest maximum and mean concentrations of almost all quantified cecs for example the maximum concentrations of the anticonvulsants lamotrigine and carbamazepine in leafy vegetables were 277 and 247 µg kg fresh weight respectively in comparison the maximum concentration of carbamazepine in tomato the most consumed crop was 1 µg kg fresh weight in general fruit bulbs and tubers exhibited the lowest concentrations of cecs for example apple and onion had the lowest cec concentrations among all crops with a maximum concentration of 0 10 µg kg fresh weight carbamazepine in apple and 0 14 µg kg fresh weight caffeine in onion this suggests that consumption of leafy vegetables leads to high exposure to cecs even though leafy vegetables were consumed at a relatively low amount compared to the other crops table 1 3 3 daily exposure to cecs via produce consumption human exposure to each cec was calculated using three scenarios tables 2 4 and s16 s18 i mean exposure scenario mean cec concentration in produce i mean consumption of produce i tables 2 and s16 ii high exposure scenario maximum cec concentration in produce i mean consumption of produce i tables 3 and s17 and iii extreme exposure scenario maximum cec concentration in produce i 95th percentile consumption of produce i tables 4 and s18 our data showed that consumption of fresh produce irrigated with reclaimed wastewater exposes the population to cecs for the general population the estimated σcecs intakes according to the mean high and extreme exposure scenarios were 2 270 17 700 and 85 700 ng person per day respectively the highest estimated exposure levels for the general population were found for the therapeutic active compounds lamotrigine carbamazepine and epoxide carbamazepine ranging from 570 870 and 510 ng person per day for the mean exposure scenario to 29 100 27 200 and 19 500 ng person per day for the extreme exposure scenario respectively tables 2 4 lower exposure levels were estimated for the pharmaceuticals bezafibrate diazepam and sulfamethoxazole as well as the corrosion inhibitor benzotriazole the psychoactives caffeine and nicotine and the metabolite dihydroxy carbamazepine tables 2 4 of the detected compounds the cecs that exhibited the lowest estimated exposure levels were 4 aminoantipyrine acetaminophen atenolol bisoprolol metoprolol sotalol venlafaxine enrofloxacin thiabendazole trimethoprim crotamiton warfarin cotinine and aspartame tables 2 4 similarly riemenschneider et al 2016 estimated daily intakes of carbamazepine epoxide carbamazepine and caffeine were 1970 540 and 70 ng person mean body weight of 70 kg per day respectively mostly due to the consumption of leafy vegetables and potatoes those results were calculated based on mean produce consumption of the spanish population and are within the range of the mean exposure scenario of carbamazepine epoxide carbamazepine and caffeine reported in this study 780 1200 450 750 and 20 ng person per day respectively table 2 mean exposure scenario however riemenschneider et al 2016 reported estimated daily intakes of gabapentin and acesulfame 120 and 150 ng person 70 kg per day respectively these values were higher compared to our data 5 ng person per day tadić et al 2021 reported a mean intake of 7 antibiotics including their metabolites of 980 ng person 70 kg per day due to the consumption of tomatoes the high and extreme exposure scenarios of the different cecs reported here were higher than those estimated in other studies liu et al 2020 meffe et al 2021b prosser and sibley 2015 riemenschneider et al 2016 tadić et al 2021 this results from our approach of using not only the mean dietary data but also the maximum cec concentration as well as the 95th percentile consumption data although the probability of these scenarios is relatively low it may be a realistic situation for population subgroups consuming high quantities of leafy vegetables originated from the same farm our data show that the estimated exposure levels were mostly affected by the consumption of leafy vegetables this is not surprising since the concentrations of most cecs in leafy vegetables were orders of magnitude higher than in the other plant organs tables s16 s19 for example 99 94 100 and 63 of lamotrigine carbamazepine benzotriazole and nicotine human intake respectively in the extreme exposure scenarios were due to consumption of leafy vegetables out of their total daily intake table 4 this would also explain the elevated exposure estimation for the arab population subgroup mean high and extreme exposure scenarios tables 2 4 and s19 which reached up to about 50 000 ng person per day of lamotrigine estimated exposure levels for vegetarians were second highest after the arab subgroup in relation to the consumption level of leafy vegetables by the two subgroups tables 4 and s15 although the estimated exposure levels of the rest of the subpopulations males females and jews were lower than for arabs and vegetarians they were of the same order of magnitude similarly schapira et al 2020 reported that vegetarians consumed the highest amount of leafy vegetables in their study and exhibited the highest occurrence and concentration of carbamazepine in their urine samples 84 and up to 110 ng l respectively moreover children who were reported to consume the lowest level of leafy vegetables were less exposed to carbamazepine 3 4 human health risk assessment all analyzed cecs exhibited hazard quotients of 1 for the mean and high exposure scenarios indicating no human health concerns high exposure scenario in table 5 however for the extreme exposure scenario table 6 the anticonvulsant agents lamotrigine carbamazepine and the therapeutic active metabolite epoxide carbamazepine exhibited hazard quotient levels 1 for the general population and every subgroup the arab population subgroup had the highest hazard quotient due to their higher consumption of leafy vegetables the highest estimated exposure levels of lamotrigine and epoxide carbamazepine exceeded the ttc values for genotoxic molecules 10 500 ng person 70 kg day while the highest estimated exposure levels of carbamazepine exceeded the adi level 24 000 ng person 70 kg day table s3 lamotrigine exhibited the highest hazard quotient values of 2 77 2 81 2 70 3 21 2 50 and 4 78 for the general population males females vegetarians jews and arabs respectively similarly malchi et al 2014 previously suggested that epoxide carbamazepine and lamotrigine may pose human health concerns due to the consumption of carrots irrigated with reclaimed wastewater table s3 because not all fields in israel are irrigated with reclaimed wastewater an additional exposure calculation was performed that adjusts for the area irrigated with fresh water and reclaimed wastewater for each crop tables s20 and s21 for example most fields of leafy vegetables 85 are freshwater irrigated thus the estimated exposure levels for leafy vegetables were adjusted accordingly assuming no contamination of the freshwater irrigated crops based on this scenario the hazard quotients of all cecs in all scenarios were reduced as expected the hazard quotients of lamotrigine calculated for the general population and the arab subgroup were reduced from 2 77 to 0 44 and from 4 78 to 0 74 respectively for carbamazepine the hazard quotient levels were reduced from 1 13 to 0 20 and from 1 92 to 0 32 respectively and for the therapeutic active metabolite epoxide carbamazepine the hazard quotient levels were reduced from 1 86 to 0 28 and from 3 20 to 0 48 respectively 4 conclusions we estimated the israeli population s unintentional daily exposure to wastewater derived cecs due to consumption of fresh produce irrigated with reclaimed wastewater and considered the associated health concerns under different scenarios the main limitation of the study is that the tested produce represented only 80 of the fresh vegetables and fruit of the mediterranean diet in addition the consumption data was collected through a 24 h dietary recall questionnaires thus do not necessarily represent an accurate habitual intake moreover our targeted analysis included only 58 analytes and perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances hormones and other agrochemicals were not included this probably resulted in an underestimation of the total cec intake and estimated exposure on the other hand our analysis was based on a representative large scale national survey of the israeli population aged 18 64 n 2808 and a comprehensive survey of cecs in crops irrigated with reclaimed wastewater collected from hundreds of locations across the state thus the exposure assessment is based on the most comprehensive dataset available moreover exposure was also calculated taking into consideration the proportion of the crops that are irrigated with freshwater to evaluate a realistic market scenario our data show that the highest unintentional human exposure to wastewater borne cecs results from the consumption of leafy vegetables thus population subgroups that consume relatively high amounts of leafy crops such as vegetarians and arabs are exposed to high levels of cecs the high concentration of cecs in the leaves is mainly a result of their passive uptake into the plant root and translocation in the xylem via the water stream towards the leaves for the more realistic scenarios hazard quotients were 1 meaning no human health concerns however for the extreme scenario maximum cec concentration and 95th percentile consumption of crops irrigated with reclaimed wastewater calculated for the anticonvulsant agents carbamazepine lamotrigine and the therapeutic active metabolite epoxide carbamazepine the hazard quotients ranged from 1 0 to 1 9 from 2 5 to 4 8 and from 1 8 to 3 2 for the general population and the various subgroups respectively this scenario may be relevant for vegetarians or arabs that consume leafy vegetables originated from a single farm using low quality reclaimed wastewater irrigation furthermore as reclaimed wastewater irrigation is expected to increase worldwide this scenario becomes more realistic it is important to note that the synergistic or additive effects of the mixture were not considered in this report in addition there is some uncertainties in the adi and ttc values for example in the case of carbamazepine the adi not based on low chronic exposure thus it is possible that adi values are not protective to reduce the potential risk we suggest limiting irrigation of leafy vegetables with reclaimed wastewater the wastewater treatment should also be improved by adding a polishing process or advanced treatment however modification of the wastewater treatment is not only costly but also takes time to implement thus from a management viewpoint minimizing reclaimed wastewater irrigation of leafy vegetables would result in a safer water reuse in the agricultural sector finally as a precautionary principle it may be reasonable to reduce exposure and human potential risks even in the absence of proven hazard declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

switzerland 13 pharmaceuticals are routinely monitored for potable water reuse however no attention has been given to agricultural water reuse in addition in 2016 new regulations were implemented to upgrade about 100 of switzerland s municipal wastewater treatment plants for the removal of micropollutants over 20 years aqua strategy 2016 miarov et al 2020 the human health risk associated with exposure to pharmaceuticals and other cecs can be assessed using two main approaches acceptable daily intake adi kumar and xagoraraki 2010 liu et al 2020 prosser and sibley 2015 and threshold of toxicological concern ttc kroes et al 2004 malchi et al 2014 meffe et al 2021a the adi value represents the daily intake of a substance that does not result in any adverse health effects to potentially exposed populations including all sensitive sub populations schwab et al 2005 adi values are calculated based on experimental data and include the point of departure i e the lowest observed dose the duration of exposure an uncertainty factor that takes into account inter and intraspecies variability and extrapolation from a low observable adverse effect level to no observable adverse effect level bercu et al 2008 kumar and xagoraraki 2010 the ttc is classified into three levels i ii and iii i e 30 9 and 1 5 µg kg body weight per day respectively based on the chemical structure of the molecule kroes et al 2005 class i compounds are easily metabolized thus presenting low toxicity concerns class ii compounds contain structures that may be more harmful than class i but do not contain structural elements that are indicative of toxicity class iii compounds contain reactive functional groups and raise higher toxicity concerns the highest concern is for potentially genotoxic compounds which may interact with dna and cause mutations in the genetic code kroes et al 2005 more et al 2019 to date only limited information is available regarding comprehensive dietary exposure to wastewater derived cecs and the associated risk for humans riemenschneider et al 2016 estimated that exposure to the anticonvulsant agent carbamazepine may reach tens of nanograms per kilogram body weight daily based on the consumption of potatoes and leafy vegetables similarly tadić et al 2021 suggested that the highest exposure to antibiotics which may also reach tens of nanograms per kilogram body weight daily is due to consumption of tomatoes liu et al 2020 concluded that human exposure to antibiotics does not exceed a few nanograms per kilogram body weight per day maximum of 5 ng kg body weight per day of triclosan these studies concluded that daily exposure to cecs via consumption of fresh produce irrigated with reclaimed wastewater does not exceed the hazard thresholds i e adi or ttc however meffe et al 2021a reported that additional toxicity tests are recommended for some genotoxic compounds found in maize irrigated with reclaimed wastewater in addition malchi et al 2014 suggested that carrot consumption of 700 g may exceed the ttc level of the carbamazepine metabolite epoxide carbamazepine for a 70 kg person however all the aforementioned studies are limited by the relatively little number of crops tested and small sample sizes in the paper by ben mordechay et al 2021 we provided data from a national survey of cecs occurrence and concentration in commercial produce collected from 445 fields irrigated with reclaimed wastewater in israel here we combine the cec concentration data in fresh produce with dietary consumption habits to provide comprehensive exposure assessments and the associated human health concerns for a realistic scenario of intensive crop irrigation with reclaimed wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant samples plant samples were collected from 469 groves and fields in israel from 2017 to 2021 ben mordechay et al 2021 that had been irrigated with reclaimed wastewater for 1 to 35 years median of 20 years eleven crops were sampled in this study leafy vegetables 64 fields carrot 43 fields orange 55 groves tangerine 63 groves tomato 43 fields potato 49 fields avocado 71 groves banana 57 groves apple 11 groves onion 9 fields and pepper 4 fields all crops were collected a few days before harvest from 10 to15 plants surrounding the center of the field in the case of fruits sampling was conducted from 6 to 8 trees located around the center of the grove in all cases fruits leaves or other plant organs collected from the same grove or field were mixed in the laboratory to obtain a single composite sample representing a single field or grove crops were selected to represent a variety of edible organs roots carrot leaves leafy vegetables fruit orange tangerine avocado banana apple pepper and tomato tuber potato and bulb onion based on their dominance in reclaimed wastewater irrigated fields and groves in israel a stratified sampling method was used to sample each crop according to its reclaimed wastewater irrigation cultivation area in israel additional information regarding the calculation of sample size for each crop and the stratifying sampling method is presented in ben mordechay et al 2021 in addition to the sampled crops additional data regarding the cecs carbamazepine the carbamazepine metabolites epoxide carbamazepine and dihydroxy carbamazepine lamotrigine trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole and caffeine in zucchini and eggplant were added based on published data goldstein et al 2014 riemenschneider et al 2016 2 2 plant sample preparation and analysis the

curves determination of lod chromatographic separation elution and elution gradient injection volumes mass spectrometer operation modes and ion source parameters are presented in ben mordechay et al 2021 crop samples irrigated with fresh water free of cecs were used as field blanks 2 3 consumption habits survey design and population data on the dietary consumption habits of the israeli population were obtained and analyzed from the 2nd israeli national health and nutrition survey the survey was carried out during 2014 2016 by the israel center for disease control the nutrition division of the israeli ministry of health and the israel central bureau of statistics and received approval from the ethics committee of the israeli ministry of health the survey s design questionnaires and operation are described in the israel center for disease control 2019 website a total of 2957 adults aged 18 64 years were interviewed face to face with a focus on food intake assessed using the 24 h recall method baranowski 2013 in addition to demographics health status and lifestyle characteristics complete recall data were obtained for 2808 of the survey participants 95 and were analyzed in the current study fig s1 demographic lifestyle and nutritional intake characteristics are presented in the supporting information and table s2 2 4 data and statistical analysis for statistical analysis of the cec levels in the produce concentrations below the lod not detected were reported as 0 zero concentration for concentrations between the lod and loq the reported concentration was loq 2 concentrations above the loq were reported as is the cross sectional consumption habits survey targeted participants based on weighting factors provided by the israel central bureau of statistics weighted sampling analysis was used to analyze the characteristics of the study participants statistical analyses were performed using the sas access 9 4 interface to adabas reference manual sas institute cary nc 2 5 human exposure and health risk assessment the estimated daily dietary exposures for each cec were calculated by multiplying the consumption values mean or 95th percentiles of each fruit or vegetable g fresh produce person per day by the concentration mean or maximum of the cec in the fresh produce ng cec g fresh produce the health risks associated with dietary exposure were assessed using both adi and ttc approaches the ttc classification was determined using toxtree software patlewicz et al 2008 adi and ttc levels are presented in table s3 human health concerns were calculated by estimating the hazard quotient which is the ratio between the dietary exposure value of each cec and its adi or ttc level a hazard quotient 1 suggests a potential human health concern due to high chronic exposure 3 results and discussion israel is considered a pioneer in the reuse of reclaimed wastewater in the agricultural sector constituting more than half of the water used for crop irrigation fu et al 2019 schacht et al 2016 here we provide a comprehensive estimation of the exposure level of the israeli population and various subgroups males females vegetarians arabs and jews to cecs based on fresh produce consumption ages 18 64 years table 1 and cec concentration in the produce tables s4 s14 3 1 population characteristics and produce consumption a total of 2808 israeli adults 50 males aged in average 40 13 years were included in a national representative dietary survey table s2 icdc 2019 the sample was predominately jewish 80 and about 50 of the participants had post secondary education the body mass index bmi of about 50 of the males and 50 of the females was within the normal weight range bmi of 18 5 24 9 35 and 25 were overweight bmi of 25 0 30 0 respectively 30 were obese bmi 30 and the rest were underweight 5 bmi 18 5 for comparison in the us 79 of the adults aged 20 74 years are overweight including 48 obese fryar et al 2018 and in europe about 50 of the population is overweight eurostat 2019 the median daily energy intake was 1525 kcal and macronutrient energy values as percentages of energy intake were within the acceptable macronutrient distribution ranges based on the dietary reference intake recommendations trumbo et al 2002 vegetarians made up 4 of the participants this is in agreement with the israeli central bureau of statistics data of vegetarians being 4 7 of the israeli population cbs 2014 in germany italy spain and the us vegetarians constitute 5 6 5 and 5 respectively of the general population based on a web questionnaire statista 2018 according to the survey the mean daily consumption sd of fruit and vegetables was 121 163 and 235 173 g person respectively and the mean total produce consumption was 356 238 g person per day in comparison the mean daily intakes of fresh fruit in europe and the us are 141 and 140 g person and of fresh vegetables 173 and 190 g person respectively efsa 2021 usda 2021 this implies a mean consumption of 314 and 330 g person per day of fresh produce in europe and the us respectively in france greece italy and spain countries that share a mediterranean diet similar to that in israel the mean daily consumption of fruit and vegetables is 145 and 236 121 and 192 190 and 241 and 155 and 144 g person respectively efsa 2021 tomato is the most consumed crop by the israeli population with a mean consumption of 68 94 g person per day which accounts for almost 20 of the daily consumption of fruit and vegetables table 1 similarly in the eu tomato is the most consumed fruit among fruit and vegetables with a mean daily intake of about 38 g person valumics 2021 israeli vegetarians consumed the largest amount of fruit and vegetables 457 258 g person per day compared to the other population subgroups males females arabs and jews 360 252 355 224 343 252 and 361 235 g person per day respectively table s15 vegetarians also exhibited the highest mean and 95th percentile consumption of almost all individual crops i e tomatoes apples potatoes cucumbers etc interestingly the arab population 20 of the israeli population exhibited the highest mean and 95th percentile consumption of leafy vegetables 33 63 and 179 g person per day respectively the consumption of leafy vegetables by vegetarians according to the survey mean and 95th percentile consumption was 28 53 and 121 g person per day respectively the importance of leafy vegetables consumption will be further discussed 3 2 cecs in edible produce the data presented in this report for pharmaceuticals and other cecs in crops account for 78 of the daily consumption of fresh produce by the israeli population table 1 moreover the dataset includes various plant organs fruit tomato avocado banana apple pepper tangerine and orange leaves leafy vegetables root carrot tuber potato and bulb onion of the 59 cecs analyzed table s1 26 were detected in at least one of the crops tables s4 s14 leafy vegetables exhibited the highest number of detectable cecs 18 as well as the highest maximum and mean concentrations of almost all quantified cecs for example the maximum concentrations of the anticonvulsants lamotrigine and carbamazepine in leafy vegetables were 277 and 247 µg kg fresh weight respectively in comparison the maximum concentration of carbamazepine in tomato the most consumed crop was 1 µg kg fresh weight in general fruit bulbs and tubers exhibited the lowest concentrations of cecs for example apple and onion had the lowest cec concentrations among all crops with a maximum concentration of 0 10 µg kg fresh weight carbamazepine in apple and 0 14 µg kg fresh weight caffeine in onion this suggests that consumption of leafy vegetables leads to high exposure to cecs even though leafy vegetables were consumed at a relatively low amount compared to the other crops table 1 3 3 daily exposure to cecs via produce consumption human exposure to each cec was calculated using three scenarios tables 2 4 and s16 s18 i mean exposure scenario mean cec concentration in produce i mean consumption of produce i tables 2 and s16 ii high exposure scenario maximum cec concentration in produce i mean consumption of produce i tables 3 and s17 and iii extreme exposure scenario maximum cec concentration in produce i 95th percentile consumption of produce i tables 4 and s18 our data showed that consumption of fresh produce irrigated with reclaimed wastewater exposes the population to cecs for the general population the estimated σcecs intakes according to the mean high and extreme exposure scenarios were 2 270 17 700 and 85 700 ng person per day respectively the highest estimated exposure levels for the general population were found for the therapeutic active compounds lamotrigine carbamazepine and epoxide carbamazepine ranging from 570 870 and 510 ng person per day for the mean exposure scenario to 29 100 27 200 and 19 500 ng person per day for the extreme exposure scenario respectively tables 2 4 lower exposure levels were estimated for the pharmaceuticals bezafibrate diazepam and sulfamethoxazole as well as the corrosion inhibitor benzotriazole the psychoactives caffeine and nicotine and the metabolite dihydroxy carbamazepine tables 2 4 of the detected compounds the cecs that exhibited the lowest estimated exposure levels were 4 aminoantipyrine acetaminophen atenolol bisoprolol metoprolol sotalol venlafaxine enrofloxacin thiabendazole trimethoprim crotamiton warfarin cotinine and aspartame tables 2 4 similarly riemenschneider et al 2016 estimated daily intakes of carbamazepine epoxide carbamazepine and caffeine were 1970 540 and 70 ng person mean body weight of 70 kg per day respectively mostly due to the consumption of leafy vegetables and potatoes those results were calculated based on mean produce consumption of the spanish population and are within the range of the mean exposure scenario of carbamazepine epoxide carbamazepine and caffeine reported in this study 780 1200 450 750 and 20 ng person per day respectively table 2 mean exposure scenario however riemenschneider et al 2016 reported estimated daily intakes of gabapentin and acesulfame 120 and 150 ng person 70 kg per day respectively these values were higher compared to our data 5 ng person per day tadić et al 2021 reported a mean intake of 7 antibiotics including their metabolites of 980 ng person 70 kg per day due to the consumption of tomatoes the high and extreme exposure scenarios of the different cecs reported here were higher than those estimated in other studies liu et al 2020 meffe et al 2021b prosser and sibley 2015 riemenschneider et al 2016 tadić et al 2021 this results from our approach of using not only the mean dietary data but also the maximum cec concentration as well as the 95th percentile consumption data although the probability of these scenarios is relatively low it may be a realistic situation for population subgroups consuming high quantities of leafy vegetables originated from the same farm our data show that the estimated exposure levels were mostly affected by the consumption of leafy vegetables this is not surprising since the concentrations of most cecs in leafy vegetables were orders of magnitude higher than in the other plant organs tables s16 s19 for example 99 94 100 and 63 of lamotrigine carbamazepine benzotriazole and nicotine human intake respectively in the extreme exposure scenarios were due to consumption of leafy vegetables out of their total daily intake table 4 this would also explain the elevated exposure estimation for the arab population subgroup mean high and extreme exposure scenarios tables 2 4 and s19 which reached up to about 50 000 ng person per day of lamotrigine estimated exposure levels for vegetarians were second highest after the arab subgroup in relation to the consumption level of leafy vegetables by the two subgroups tables 4 and s15 although the estimated exposure levels of the rest of the subpopulations males females and jews were lower than for arabs and vegetarians they were of the same order of magnitude similarly schapira et al 2020 reported that vegetarians consumed the highest amount of leafy vegetables in their study and exhibited the highest occurrence and concentration of carbamazepine in their urine samples 84 and up to 110 ng l respectively moreover children who were reported to consume the lowest level of leafy vegetables were less exposed to carbamazepine 3 4 human health risk assessment all analyzed cecs exhibited hazard quotients of 1 for the mean and high exposure scenarios indicating no human health concerns high exposure scenario in table 5 however for the extreme exposure scenario table 6 the anticonvulsant agents lamotrigine carbamazepine and the therapeutic active metabolite epoxide carbamazepine exhibited hazard quotient levels 1 for the general population and every subgroup the arab population subgroup had the highest hazard quotient due to their higher consumption of leafy vegetables the highest estimated exposure levels of lamotrigine and epoxide carbamazepine exceeded the ttc values for genotoxic molecules 10 500 ng person 70 kg day while the highest estimated exposure levels of carbamazepine exceeded the adi level 24 000 ng person 70 kg day table s3 lamotrigine exhibited the highest hazard quotient values of 2 77 2 81 2 70 3 21 2 50 and 4 78 for the general population males females vegetarians jews and arabs respectively similarly malchi et al 2014 previously suggested that epoxide carbamazepine and lamotrigine may pose human health concerns due to the consumption of carrots irrigated with reclaimed wastewater table s3 because not all fields in israel are irrigated with reclaimed wastewater an additional exposure calculation was performed that adjusts for the area irrigated with fresh water and reclaimed wastewater for each crop tables s20 and s21 for example most fields of leafy vegetables 85 are freshwater irrigated thus the estimated exposure levels for leafy vegetables were adjusted accordingly assuming no contamination of the freshwater irrigated crops based on this scenario the hazard quotients of all cecs in all scenarios were reduced as expected the hazard quotients of lamotrigine calculated for the general population and the arab subgroup were reduced from 2 77 to 0 44 and from 4 78 to 0 74 respectively for carbamazepine the hazard quotient levels were reduced from 1 13 to 0 20 and from 1 92 to 0 32 respectively and for the therapeutic active metabolite epoxide carbamazepine the hazard quotient levels were reduced from 1 86 to 0 28 and from 3 20 to 0 48 respectively 4 conclusions we estimated the israeli population s unintentional daily exposure to wastewater derived cecs due to consumption of fresh produce irrigated with reclaimed wastewater and considered the associated health concerns under different scenarios the main limitation of the study is that the tested produce represented only 80 of the fresh vegetables and fruit of the mediterranean diet in addition the consumption data was collected through a 24 h dietary recall questionnaires thus do not necessarily represent an accurate habitual intake moreover our targeted analysis included only 58 analytes and perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances hormones and other agrochemicals were not included this probably resulted in an underestimation of the total cec intake and estimated exposure on the other hand our analysis was based on a representative large scale national survey of the israeli population aged 18 64 n 2808 and a comprehensive survey of cecs in crops irrigated with reclaimed wastewater collected from hundreds of locations across the state thus the exposure assessment is based on the most comprehensive dataset available moreover exposure was also calculated taking into consideration the proportion of the crops that are irrigated with freshwater to evaluate a realistic market scenario our data show that the highest unintentional human exposure to wastewater borne cecs results from the consumption of leafy vegetables thus population subgroups that consume relatively high amounts of leafy crops such as vegetarians and arabs are exposed to high levels of cecs the high concentration of cecs in the leaves is mainly a result of their passive uptake into the plant root and translocation in the xylem via the water stream towards the leaves for the more realistic scenarios hazard quotients were 1 meaning no human health concerns however for the extreme scenario maximum cec concentration and 95th percentile consumption of crops irrigated with reclaimed wastewater calculated for the anticonvulsant agents carbamazepine lamotrigine and the therapeutic active metabolite epoxide carbamazepine the hazard quotients ranged from 1 0 to 1 9 from 2 5 to 4 8 and from 1 8 to 3 2 for the general population and the various subgroups respectively this scenario may be relevant for vegetarians or arabs that consume leafy vegetables originated from a single farm using low quality reclaimed wastewater irrigation furthermore as reclaimed wastewater irrigation is expected to increase worldwide this scenario becomes more realistic it is important to note that the synergistic or additive effects of the mixture were not considered in this report in addition there is some uncertainties in the adi and ttc values for example in the case of carbamazepine the adi not based on low chronic exposure thus it is possible that adi values are not protective to reduce the potential risk we suggest limiting irrigation of leafy vegetables with reclaimed wastewater the wastewater treatment should also be improved by adding a polishing process or advanced treatment however modification of the wastewater treatment is not only costly but also takes time to implement thus from a management viewpoint minimizing reclaimed wastewater irrigation of leafy vegetables would result in a safer water reuse in the agricultural sector finally as a precautionary principle it may be reasonable to reduce exposure and human potential risks even in the absence of proven hazard declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

15566,natural hydroxyl radical oh production which partially occurs through the microbially driven fenton reaction can enhance the degradation of polystyrene microplastics ps mps however oh causes damage to microorganisms which might in turn restrain the microbially driven fenton reaction thus whether ps mps can be continuously degraded by the microbially driven fenton reaction and how they are degraded are still unknown a pure culture system using shewanella putrefaciens 200 was set up to explore the effect and mechanism of microbially driven fenton reaction on ps mp degradation in a 14 day operation oh produced by the microbially driven fenton reaction could degrade ps mps with a weight loss of 6 1 0 6 and an o c ratio of 0 6 v s 0 6 0 1 and 0 1 respectively in the oh quenched group benzene ring derivatives such as 2 isopropyl 5 methyl 1 heptanol and nonahexacontanoic acid were the main soluble products of ps mp degradation the oh induced oxidative damage on microorganisms did not affect oh production significantly when there was timely replenishment of organic carbon sources to promote reproduction of microorganisms thus ps mps can be continuously degraded by microbially driven fenton reactions in natural alternating anaerobic aerobic environments this study also provides a new microbial technique for mp degradation that is different from previous technologies based on microbial plastic degrading enzymes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords polystyrene microplastic fenton reaction iron reducing bacterium hydroxyl radical microbial damage data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microplastics mps which are usually defined as plastic particles 5 mm are environmental pollutants of increasing scientific and public concern as their high durability and low biodegradability pose a direct threat to a range of organisms including humans through ingestion and accumulation zhu et al 2019 meides et al 2021 okoffo et al 2021 mps have been found in all kinds of environmental media including water sediment soil and even the atmosphere li et al 2018 na et al 2021 koelmans et al 2019 he et al 2020 guo et al 2020 chen et al 2020 our previous research studied mp degradation under different anaerobic aerobic zones i e river beach and intertidal zones in situ sediments and demonstrated that the degradation of polystyrene microplastics ps mps in the alternating anaerobic aerobic intertidal zone was significantly faster than that in static anoxic and static oxic zones chen et al 2021 we attributed the faster degradation of ps mps in this region to the dark production of hydroxyl radicals oh which showed a positive correlation with an fe redox process moreover our experiments with sterilized substrates demonstrated that 38 5 of dark oh production was microbially driven polystyrene ps is one of the most common thermoplastics accounting for 7 1 of the total global plastic production and it is known as the representative plastic due to its application in various fields ho et al 2017 unlike heteroatomic polymers such as polyethylene terephthalate and polyurethane which can be processed through photooxidation hydrolysis and biological degradation ps is a cc backbone polymer that is inert to hydrolysis and prevents rapid degradation it is susceptible to thermal oxidation however thermal oxidation rarely occurs naturally because of the strict conditions and temperature of the reaction albertsson et al 1993 krueger et al 2015 microbially driven fenton reactions generated through alternating anaerobic aerobic cycles have been shown to enhance the degradation of contaminants such as pentachlorophenol 1 4 dioxane enrofloxacin and 2 2 4 4 tetrabrominated diphenyl ether mckinzi and dichristina 1999 sekar and dichristina 2014 yan et al 2016 peng et al 2020 in the microbially driven fenton reaction iron reducing microorganisms reduce fe iii to fe ii for respiration under anoxic conditions eq 1 while o2 is converted to h2o2 by both purely chemical pathways fe ii autoxidation eqs 2 and 3 and biotic pathways e g amino acid oxidase catalyzed reactions that result in the two electron reduction of o2 to h2o2 eqs 4 and 5 under oxic conditions then the hydroxyl radical oh which is the key oxidant to degrade contaminants is produced by the interaction of h2o2 with fe

most of the above experiments were conducted within 7 days however compared with these experiments the degradation of ps mps was a long term process and ps mps only displayed 4 6 0 13 weight losses in our previous in situ experiment under alternating anoxic oxic conditions during a 2 month treatment period oh might trigger membrane lipid peroxidation which leads to microbial inactivation zhang et al 2020a incubated a field sediment with shewanella oneidensis mr 1 and treated it for six anoxic oxic cycles every cycle included 117 h anoxic and 6 h oxic periods and six cycles equaled 30 days the number of mr 1 cells decreased by almost 2 orders of magnitude after six anoxic oxic cycles which decreased by almost 0 7 orders of magnitude when the running time reached 14 days the running time of our experiment in this article the number and activity of microorganisms are important for the microbially driven fenton reaction since the decreased number and activity of microorganisms would suppress bioreduction of fe iii in anoxic periods and oh production in oxic periods which would in turn restrain the microbially driven fenton reaction wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a in addition there is a large amount of organic matter in the natural environment that acts as a carbon source for iron reducing bacteria and simultaneously may compete with mps for oh thus whether mps can be continuously degraded by microbially driven fenton reactions and how they are degraded are still unknown therefore this study aimed to evaluate the effect of the microbially driven fenton reaction on mp degradation and to reveal whether microbial inactivation and organic matter influence mp degradation we set up a pure culture system using shewanella putrefaciens 200 as a typical dissimilatory iron reducing bacterium since it is a facultative anaerobic bacterium and abundant in alternating anaerobic aerobic areas mckinzi and dichristina 1999 rotaru et al 2021 ps mps were employed as the model mps and lactate and ferric citrate were utilized to represent the organic matter and the iron oxides in the environment the pathway of ps mp degradation and microbial inactivation by oh generated from microbially driven fenton reactions was also determined knowledge generated from this work will provide new insights for mp risk assessment in natural environments and serve as a basis for the development of mp degradation engineering techniques 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial culture and ps mp preparation s putrefaciens strain 200 was obtained from american type culture collection atcc and cultured aerobically on luria bertani broth medium 10 g l tryptone 5 g l yeast extract and 10 g l nacl on a rotary shaker 200 rpm 30 c the ps mp degradation experiment was conducted in a 10 mm lactate supplemented solution ls ph 7 0 table s1 and then fe iii citrate was added at a final concentration of 10 mm the ps film was prepared according to yang et al 2015 the ps particles figure s1 the outer diameter of which ranged from 1 20 to 1 30 mm were purchased from king pearl co tianjin china and dissolved in 0 03 g ml xylene aqueous solution then the dissolved ps solution was evenly poured into glass plates to prepare a piece of ps film with a thickness of 0 20 0 02 mm after 6 h of drying the piece of ps film was rinsed with methanol solvent and deionized water to remove the residual xylene finally the ps film was dried at room temperature and then cut into mp sheets 5 00 0 10 mm in length and 5 00 0 10 mm in width 2 2 pure culture experimental operation the s putrefaciens 200 batch culture was used to verify the microbially driven fenton degradation of ps mps s putrefaciens 200 of the early stationary phase with an od600 of 1 5 was collected by centrifugation at 6000 g and washed three times with 0 9 nacl mckinzi and dichristina 1999 sekar and dichristina 2014 then the concentrated s putrefaciens 200 was resuspended in ls with an od600 of 0 5 the cell culture was allowed to reduce fe iii citrate under anaerobic conditions which was maintained by continuous sparging with nitrogen gas the aerobic condition was initiated by sparging with air lactate with a final concentration of 10 mm was replenished into each reactor every day the temperature and ph were 25 c and 7 0 respectively and 100 10 mg of ps mps was added to each reactor figure s2 the experimental group i e o2 n2 fe s putrefaciens 200 consisted of s putrefaciens 200 batch cultures amended with fe ⅲ under alternating anaerobic aerobic periods of 6 h to confirm that ps mps were degraded by oh which was generated by the s putrefaciens 200 driven fenton reaction five control groups were set as follows 1 the iron free group i e o2 n2 s putrefaciens 200 which replaced fe iii citrate with 10 mm no3 as the electron acceptor 2 the oh quenched group i e o2 n2 fe s putrefaciens 200 oh scavenger in which 120 mm oh scavenging mannitol that could not be degraded by was added 3 the sterile group i e o2 n2 fe which had no microorganisms 4 the strictly anaerobic group i e n2 fe s putrefaciens 200 which was continuously exposed to nitrogen and 5 the strictly aerobic group i e o2 fe s putrefaciens 200 which was continuously exposed to air 2 3 ps mp characterization after 14 days of operation we gathered the residual ps mps and immersed them in 2 sodium dodecyl sulfate sds for 4 h to remove impurities from the surface and the ps mps were rinsed with deionized water and dried at room temperature then the physicochemical properties of ps mps

240ac ms us thermo usa the solution in each reactor was collected after 14 days of operation and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min and then the supernatant was collected and filtered with a 0 22 µm microporous membrane the filtrate was freeze dried in a vacuum freezer alphal 4 dplus christ germany and then dissolved in 5 ml of methylene chloride after being fully dissolved by shaking the filtrate was filtered using a 0 22 µm organic filter membrane the methylene chloride was volatilized by a pressure blowing concentrator and the remaining precipitate was dissolved with methylene chloride again then the dissolved precipitate was detected using gc ms with a db 5 type column and the following heating procedure 50 c for 1 min then increased to 250 c at a rate of 10 c min and kept at 250 c for 5 min 2 4 detection of the microbially driven fenton reaction the fe ii h2o2 and oh concentrations in all reactors were determined without ps mp addition fe ii concentrations were determined with a ferrozine based detection method according to dichristina et al 1992 h2o2 concentrations were determined using an i3 method assay klassen et al 1994 1 ml of solution a consisting of 400 mm ki 50 mm naoh and 170 μm ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate was mixed with an equal volume of solution b consisting of 100 mm potassium hydrogen phthalate after 1 ml of sample was added and reacted in the dark for 5 min the absorbance of the resulting solution was measured at 350 nm to determine the h2o2 concentration sodium benzoate 15 mm was added to all groups to trap oh radicals by forming p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba the cumulative oh concentrations were quantified by measuring the concentration of p hba using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography uhplc ultimate 3000 thermo usa with a c18 column 4 6 250 mm where the uv detection wavelength was 255 nm the mobile phase of uhplc and the product calculation referred to liao et al 2019 2 5 analysis of microbial inactivation the live dead baclight bacterial viability kit invitrogen ca was used to distinguish live and dead cells by staining the stained cells were observed by using confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm lsm880 zeiss germany at least 3 clsm observation areas 650 650 μm for each field of view were selected and the ratio of viable total cells i e percentage of living cells was calculated based on the counting per area obj total via image pro plus 6 0 software xiang et al 2017 the higher the ratio was the stronger the microbial activity the electron transport system activity etsa can characterize the activity of microorganisms in essence this method indirectly indicates microbial activity by measuring microbial respiratory activity some redox dyes are often used as artificial electron acceptors and they are reduced under the action of the microbial electron transport system along with obvious color changes here we used 2 3 5 triphenyltetrazolium chloride ttc as our redox dye which is colorless in the oxidation state ryssov nielsen 1975 ttc can be reduced to 1 3 5 triphenylformazan ttf which is red and insoluble according to relexans 1996 1 ml of bacterial liquid was mixed with 1 5 ml of tris hcl buffer solution 0 5 ml of 0 36 na2so3 solution and 2 ml of 0 4 ttc solution after the bacteria were cultured in an incubator shaker for 30 min 1 ml of 37 formaldehyde was added to terminate the enzyme reaction the above steps were performed in the dark the sample was centrifuged at 4000 g for 5 min at 25 c and then the supernatant was discarded xiao et al 2017 the produced triphenyl formazan was extracted with 5 ml of acetone and the concentration was measured by uv vis spectroscopy at 485 nm n acetylglucosamine nag is one of the monomers of peptidoglycan in bacterial cell walls when cell walls are damaged nag will be released from the damaged cells thus nag concentrations can indirectly indicate the damage degree of cells nagata et al 2003 li et al 2021 potassium ferricyanide k3 fe cn 6 was used as the chromogenic agent the green fe cn 6 3 could be reduced by nag to form the colorless fe cn 6 4 thus the nag content is proportional to the color intensity of the reaction solution according to the modified schales method imoto and yagishita 1971 1 5 ml of bacterial suspension and 2 ml of k3 fe cn 6 solution i e mixture of 0 5 g k3 fe cn 6 and 1 l of 0 5 m na2co3 will be mixed and heated in a boiling water bath for 15 min after cooling the optical density at 420 nm will be read by uv vis spectroscopy 2 6 statistical analysis data analysis was performed with ibm spss statistics 25 0 and the results are presented as the mean or mean sd standard deviation the normal distribution test was taken for original data and under the assumption that the sample was normal the differences among different groups were compared using one way anova followed by bonferroni s test and differences were considered to be significant at p 0 05 midway et al 2020 3 results 3 1 degradation of ps mps by dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria the weight loss of ps mps in our experimental group was 6 1 0 6 within 14 days while the weight loss of the strictly aerobic group was just 1 0 5 and those of the other control groups were even less than 0 5 fig 1 a that is the weight loss of ps mps in the experimental group was over 11 5 times higher than that in the other five control groups the speed of biodegradation and photodegradation of ps was slow table s2 the reason for the slow biodegradation is that the high degree of polymerization of ps prevents it from being used as a substrate for microbial enzymatic reactions ps is a cc backbone polymer that is difficult to hydrolyze thus it is difficult to be transported into microbial cells and microorganisms have difficulty attaching to the surface of ps albertsson et al 1993 krueger et al 2015 virgin ps is not responsive to degradation by ultraviolet uv light because of the presence of phenyl rings in its repeating units which is the reason for its slow photodegradation bandyopadhyay and basak 2007 gpc was employed to analyze the molecular weight of ps mps the polydispersity index pdi mw mn where mw is the average molecular weight and mn is the number average molecular weight can characterize the molecular weight heterogeneity of polymers the larger the pdi value is the wider the molecular weight distribution and the higher the degree of depolymerization as shown in fig 1b after 14 days the pdi of ps mps in the experimental group was 1 9274 which was higher than that in all five control groups thus the gpc results demonstrated that the degree of ps mp depolymerization in the experimental group was the highest sem was applied to directly analyze the surface morphological characteristics of ps mps the surfaces of the pristine ps mp were smooth and after 14 days the surfaces of ps mps in the experimental group had the largest number of cavities among all groups which were up to 0 8 µm in diameter fewer tiny cavities appeared in the strictly aerobic iron free and oh quenched groups than in the group with microbial degradation fig 1c ps mps in the strictly anaerobic and sterile groups had hardly any cavities wca data could reflect the surface hydrophilicity of ps mps fig 1d shows that after 14 days the wca of ps mps in the experimental group was the smallest 63 0 0 6 while those of the other control groups were over 81 6 which indicated that ps mps in the experimental group had the highest hydrophilicity the higher the hydrophilicity was i e the smaller the wca was the greater the degree of degradation was feng et al 2021 waldman and rillig 2020 thus ps mps in the experimental group had the greatest degree of degradation in addition surfaces with higher hydrophilia were more easily colonized by microorganisms which led to improved subsequent degradation previous studies table s2 have shown that the abiotic fenton degraded ps by a 7 37 decrease in wca and a 34 26 increase in the oxygen content of ps surfaces in 48 h such degradation was more rapid than the microbially drive fenton reaction however abiotic fenton needs to artificially add fenton reagents that cannot occur in the natural environment the o c ratio could quantitatively describe the degree of surface degradation of mps after 14 days the o c ratio of the experimental group was 0 6 ratios were 0 10 to 0 17 in the strictly aerobic the iron free and the oh quenched groups and ranged from 0 06 to 0 07 in the strictly anaerobic and the sterile groups in summary the o c ratio of ps mps in the experimental group was over 4 66 times higher than those in the five control groups the increased oxygen content indicated that oxidation took place on ps mps that is the microbially driven fenton reaction most strongly promoted the oxidation of ps mps atr ftir spectroscopy and xps were used to characterize the functional groups and chemical compositions on the surface of ps mps compared to the atr ftir spectra of all control groups three new absorption peaks at 3191 cm 1 1643 cm 1 and 1098 cm 1 which represent the stretching vibrations of oh c o and co respectively appeared in the experimental group fig 2 a xps spectra fig 2b show that the o 1 s peak of ps mps was enhanced most significantly in the experimental group which only increased slightly in the strictly aerobic the iron free and the oh quenched groups and barely increased in the strictly anaerobic and the sterile groups in the c 1 s spectrum of ps mps fig 2c additional co peaks 286 5 ev appeared in the experimental strictly aerobic iron free and oh quenched groups and the intensity of the co peak in the experimental group was highest among all groups in the o 1 s spectra of ps mps fig 2d c o 532 24 ev co 533 12 ev co oh 533 90 ev and o co o 535 41 ev appeared in the experimental strictly aerobic iron free and oh quenched groups while there was no o co o peak in the strictly anaerobic and sterile groups oxygen atoms and oxygen containing functional groups in ps mps indicated that the ps mp surfaces were oxidized during the treatments al abdulal et al 2015 the carbonyl index ci is normally used to characterize the aging degree of plastics and is calculated by the intensity of carbonyl groups relative to the methylene peak rouillon et al 2016 domínguez jaimes et al 2021 liu et al 2019 compared to the control groups the ci in the experimental group was the highest which meant that the aging degree of ps mps in the experimental group was highest table s3 thus the atr ftir and xps items characterized the oxidation degree of ps mps the above data revealed that ps mps in the experimental group had the highest oxidation degree in summary the above multiple parameters revealed that the degree of ps mp degradation in the experimental group was significantly higher than that in all control groups within 14 days 3 2 production of oh by the microbially driven fenton reaction to determine whether the optimal degradation effect of the experimental group was caused by the microbially driven fenton reaction we detected the concentrations of fe ii h2o2 and oh fig 3 a shows that fe ii concentrations increased in the anaerobic stage and decreased in the aerobic stage in the experimental group and the oh quenched group the fe ii concentration was maintained in the range of 8 9 mmol l in the strictly anaerobic group and could hardly be detected in the other control groups indicating that fe ii was mainly produced by microbial anaerobic respiration the fe ii concentrations in the experimental group and the oh quenched group could not be restored to their highest levels unless lactate was replenished which may be a result of the reduced electron donors available to microorganisms and the decreased microbial activities when we measured the h2o2 concentration the original electron acceptor fe iii was replaced by nitrate and the iron free group did not add any electron acceptor fig 3b shows that the h2o2 concentrations in the experimental group and the iron free and oh quenched groups were similar in which h2o2 was generated in the aerobic stage and then slightly decreased in the anaerobic stage the h2o2 content in the strictly aerobic group continued to increase and almost no h2o2 was produced in the strictly anaerobic group and the sterile group indicating that h2o2 was mainly produced in microbial aerobic respiration sodium benzoate was added as an oh trapping agent in all groups to detect the oh concentration bau and kurz 2011 fig 3c shows that the oh concentration in the experimental group continued to rise and the slope of the oh curve in the aerobic stage was higher than that in the anaerobic stage that is the rates of oh production in the aerobic phase were higher than those in the anaerobic phase and the oh yield reached 30 μmol l during 48 h while the yields of oh in the other 5 control groups were all below 3 μmol l combining the results of microbially driven fenton reactions and ps mp degradation the best degradation performance of ps mps in the experimental group was attributed to oh production h2o2 might also have little effect on ps mp degradation since the strictly aerobic group the iron free group and the sterile group had slight ps mp degradation although there was almost no oh generation in these three groups the coexistence of iron reducing bacteria and the alternating anaerobic aerobic environment were essential conditions for the occurrence of microbially driven fenton reactions thus whether microbial activity could be maintained was the premise to maintain stable oh production and ps mp degradation 3 3 oh induced oxidative damage did not affect the microbially driven fenton reaction in the presence of organic carbon source supplements hydroxyl radicals are strong oxidants that may simultaneously cause damage to microorganisms while they oxidize ps mps ahmed et al 2021 to verify whether the microbially driven fenton reaction affected the microbial activity which in turn affected the efficiency of the fenton reaction samples were taken at 6 hour intervals from the experimental the iron free and the oh quenched groups and observed using clsm table 1 shows that proportions of live cells in the iron free and oh quenched groups in which oh could hardly be detected were significantly larger than those in the experimental group suggesting that oh generated by the microbially driven fenton reaction might be harmful to s putrefaciens 200 moreover the contents of etsa and nag in these three groups were also measured to evaluate bacterial damage fig 4 nag is one of the monomers of peptidoglycans in bacterial cell walls that is released when the cell walls are damaged thus larger nag contents represent more serious damage to cell walls etsa was used to evaluate the microbial activity thus larger etsa contents signified less damage after the first 12 h the etsa of the experimental group decreased the most 65 86 0 98 and the nag content increased the most 67 09 1 62 indicating that the experimental group had the highest degree of microbial damage which was in agreement with the clsm results that is oh production in the experimental group indeed caused cell damage although there was no oh production the contents of etsa still decreased and the contents of nag still increased in the iron free and oh quenched groups it was inferred to be caused by h2o2 induced oxidative damage and by the lack of carbon sources i e sodium lactate after a few hours of operation filho and meneghini 1984 cheng et al 2021 carbon sources can promote the growth and reproduction of microorganisms and provide carbon scaffoldings for cells high tides generally occur every 12 h garrett and maas 1993 thus we replenished sodium lactate final concentration 10 mm at 12 h in each group to simulate abundant organic matter brought by high tides as shown in fig 4 the contents of nag in all three groups recovered i e nag decreased to the initial level or even lower than it the contents of etsa in the iron free and oh quenched groups also recovered i e etsa rose to the initial level or even higher than it however the etsa of the experimental group did not immediately change obviously in the following 6 h while at 24 h it recovered to a content level close to that at 6 h according to richardson 2000 during chemoheterotrophic growth on reduced carbon sources the carbon substrate must be oxidized to the level at which it can be assimilated therefore it was inferred that the overdue of the recovery of etsa after adding sodium lactate in the experimental group was because the added sodium lactate had not been oxidized to the assimilable level in the following 6 h these results indicated that the lack of a carbon source led to cell damage in the iron free and oh quenched groups and both oh induced oxidative damage and the lack of a carbon source caused cell damage in the experimental group in which oh induced oxidative damage was the primary reason since the etsa content in the experimental group could not recover in a timely manner zhang et al 2020a incubated a field sediment with shewanella oneidensis mr 1 and operated the experiment for six anoxic oxic cycles in nearly one month without extra carbon resources added and they found that the generated oh affected mr 1 activity by damaging cell membranes which further decreased fe iii bioreduction in the anoxic period which would in turn have a negative effect on oh production our experiment also demonstrated cell damage however the damage did not obviously affect oh production fig 3c since we replenished lactate in the culture every day mannitol used as an oh scavenger cannot act as a carbon source to affect the growth rate of microorganisms sekar and dichristina 2014 the concentration of mannitol was high enough to quench the vast majority of oh in the system the oh concentration in the o2 n2 fe s putrefaciens 200 oh scavenger group was under 3 μmol l while in the experimental group it was approximately 30 μmol l during 48 h which is why we chose mannitol as the scavenger of oh for strict control in the previous experiment in natural sediments there are many quenched molecules for oh which may also act as carbon sources such as lactate groussard et al 2000 in the natural environment with alternating anaerobic aerobic conditions such as the intertidal zone chen et al 2021 organic carbon sources can be continuously provided by the water flow which is similar to the continuous lactate addition in our experiment that is oh can be continuously generated by the microbially driven fenton reaction in the natural environment in the natural environment with alternating anaerobic aerobic conditions such as the intertidal zone chen et al 2021 organic carbon sources can be continuously provided by the water flow which is similar to the continuous lactate addition in our experiment that is oh can be continuously generated by the microbially driven fenton reaction in the natural environment 3 4 possible degradation pathway of ps mps by the microbially driven fenton reaction a large amount of low molecular weight organic matter would be produced during ps mp degradation biale et al 2021 thus we detected the water soluble low molecular weight products of ps mps by gc ms to analyze the degradation pathway to focus on the effect of oh produced by the microbially driven fenton reaction and avoid interference from the medium and microbial metabolites we set the experimental group the sterile group and the ps free group i e a group without ps mps under the same conditions as the experimental group the gc spectra of water soluble low molecular weight intermediates extracted from the medium after 14 days are shown in figure s2 compared with the ps free group the experimental group and the sterile group had more peaks of low molecular products peaks in the experimental group were most obvious and had the largest number peaks in the sterile group represented low molecular weight organic matter from the medium and the microbial metabolites compared to the sterile group the experimental group had more peaks such as the peak appearing at 9 12 min and the peak appearing at 23 63 min based on the unique ability of ms to identify unknown compounds we used ms to further analyze the products separated by gc the corresponding substances at peak times of 9 12 min and 23 63 min were two benzene ring derivatives 2 isopropyl 5 methyl 1 heptanol and nonahexacontanoic acid respectively which likely came from the low molecular weight products generated by the chain dispolymerization of long chain molecules of ps mps the possible depolymerization pathway of ps mps fig 5 by the microbially driven fenton reaction was analyzed by combining atr ftir xps and gc ms data bianco et al 2020 shang et al 2003 krueger et al 2017 then the chain breaking in normal and weak chains produced terminal radicals which could effectively react with the molecular oxygen to form the peroxy radical the peroxy radical formed stable groups on the chains of polymer molecules such as oh through hydrogen abstraction after recombination and other reactions such as the radical addition reaction oh transformed to cooh c o and other groups with the prolongation of reaction time and the deepening of reaction intensity many low molecular weight products e g 2 isopropyl 5 methyl 1 heptanol and nonahexacontanoic acid were produced in succession a previous study esplugas et al 2002 showed that oh could not only attack the long chains on the benzene rings but also cleave the benzene rings studies on the kinetic constant found that limiting factors of oh production by fenton reaction were amounts of h2o2 and fe ii neyens and baeyens 2003 naffrechoux et al 2000 in the microbially driven fenton reaction the amounts of h2o2 and fe ii depend on the number and activity of microorganisms therefore this ps degradation process by the microbially driven fenton reaction is considered to be sustainable as long as the microorganisms are activated and electron donors are adequate that is ps can be completely degraded by the microbially driven fenton reaction 3 5 implications in natural alternating anaerobic aerobic environments such as the intertidal zone and the paddy field carbon sources can be constantly provided by the water flow the analysis of microbial inactivation in our study proved that microorganisms were indeed damaged by oh however the oh production in the experimental group was not affected due to the timely replenishment of organic carbon sources which could promote the growth and reproduction of microorganisms and consequently maintain the activity of microbial populations even if it does not work immediately thus damage by oh on microorganisms can be repaired and the continuous production of oh can be maintained in the above natural environments extraction and identification of mps is the first step in the risk assessment of mps which involves investigation of the mp distribution in the natural environment wet peroxide oxidation wpo with h2o2 and fe ii is a common and cost effective method to degrade organic matter in sediments before the extraction and identification of mps from sediment samples zhang et al 2020b monteiro et al 2022 our results showed that even in the presence of abundant organic matter oh can attack mps and change their physical and chemical properties including functional groups oxygen containing groups and o c ratios and then affect risk assessment prata et al 2019 thus based on our results if we only investigate the amount and types of mps in sediments the effects of h2o2 and oh in the preprocessing steps could be ignored however if the weight and physicochemical properties of mps should also be investigated the effects of h2o2 and oh used in the sample pretreatment should be taken into account microbial technology is considered an environmentally friendly treatment for plastic waste although the microbial degradation rate is prolonged previous studies on the microbial degradation of plastics have focused on looking for specific microorganisms that can synthesize and secrete plastic degrading enzymes these microorganisms excrete extracellular enzymes such as alkane hydroxylases and hydroquinone peroxidases to depolymerize plastic including ps polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polyvinyl chloride pvc polyurethane pur and polyethylene terephthalate pet into short polymer intermediates which are ultimately assimilated by microbes as carbon sources asmita et al 2015 moharir and kumar 2018 shah et al 2008 jadaun et al 2022 our study provides a new mechanism for microbial plastic degradation that is different from that of previous microbial degradation the fenton reaction could be driven by many facultative anaerobic iron reducing microorganisms e g shewanella sp pseudomonas sp and bacillus sp etc which are more common than special microorganisms that secrete plastic degrading enzymes koch and harnisch 2016 logan et al 2019 thus these findings also provide new insights into broadening the library of known bacterial types for the microbial degradation of plastics 4 conclusion this work reveals that the microbially driven fenton reaction under alternating anaerobic aerobic conditions can be continuously applied to mp degradation within 14 days the weight loss of ps mps in the experimental group i e o2 n2 fe s putrefaciens 200 and the o c ratio were the highest in all six groups confirming that mp degradation was a consequence of oh produced by the microbially driven fenton reaction benzene ring derivatives such as 2 isopropyl 5 methyl 1 heptanol and nonahexacontanoic acid were the water soluble low molecular weight products of mp degradation oh can be continuously produced when there is replenishment of organic carbon sources to promote the reproduction of microorganisms this study provides direct evidence for the role of the microbially driven fenton reaction in mp degradation in nature and broadens the available bacterial types for microbial plastic degradation appendix a supplementary data supplementary data to this article can be found online at https declaration of

15566,natural hydroxyl radical oh production which partially occurs through the microbially driven fenton reaction can enhance the degradation of polystyrene microplastics ps mps however oh causes damage to microorganisms which might in turn restrain the microbially driven fenton reaction thus whether ps mps can be continuously degraded by the microbially driven fenton reaction and how they are degraded are still unknown a pure culture system using shewanella putrefaciens 200 was set up to explore the effect and mechanism of microbially driven fenton reaction on ps mp degradation in a 14 day operation oh produced by the microbially driven fenton reaction could degrade ps mps with a weight loss of 6 1 0 6 and an o c ratio of 0 6 v s 0 6 0 1 and 0 1 respectively in the oh quenched group benzene ring derivatives such as 2 isopropyl 5 methyl 1 heptanol and nonahexacontanoic acid were the main soluble products of ps mp degradation the oh induced oxidative damage on microorganisms did not affect oh production significantly when there was timely replenishment of organic carbon sources to promote reproduction of microorganisms thus ps mps can be continuously degraded by microbially driven fenton reactions in natural alternating anaerobic aerobic environments this study also provides a new microbial technique for mp degradation that is different from previous technologies based on microbial plastic degrading enzymes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords polystyrene microplastic fenton reaction iron reducing bacterium hydroxyl radical microbial damage data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microplastics mps which are usually defined as plastic particles 5 mm are environmental pollutants of increasing scientific and public concern as their high durability and low biodegradability pose a direct threat to a range of organisms including humans through ingestion and accumulation zhu et al 2019 meides et al 2021 okoffo et al 2021 mps have been found in all kinds of environmental media including water sediment soil and even the atmosphere li et al 2018 na et al 2021 koelmans et al 2019 he et al 2020 guo et al 2020 chen et al 2020 our previous research studied mp degradation under different anaerobic aerobic zones i e river beach and intertidal zones in situ sediments and demonstrated that the degradation of polystyrene microplastics ps mps in the alternating anaerobic aerobic intertidal zone was significantly faster than that in static anoxic and static oxic zones chen et al 2021 we attributed the faster degradation of ps mps in this region to the dark production of hydroxyl radicals oh which showed a positive correlation with an fe redox process moreover our experiments with sterilized substrates demonstrated that 38 5 of dark oh production was microbially driven polystyrene ps is one of the most common thermoplastics accounting for 7 1 of the total global plastic production and it is known as the representative plastic due to its application in various fields ho et al 2017 unlike heteroatomic polymers such as polyethylene terephthalate and polyurethane which can be processed through photooxidation hydrolysis and biological degradation ps is a cc backbone polymer that is inert to hydrolysis and prevents rapid degradation it is susceptible to thermal oxidation however thermal oxidation rarely occurs naturally because of the strict conditions and temperature of the reaction albertsson et al 1993 krueger et al 2015 microbially driven fenton reactions generated through alternating anaerobic aerobic cycles have been shown to enhance the degradation of contaminants such as pentachlorophenol 1 4 dioxane enrofloxacin and 2 2 4 4 tetrabrominated diphenyl ether mckinzi and dichristina 1999 sekar and dichristina 2014 yan et al 2016 peng et al 2020 in the microbially driven fenton reaction iron reducing microorganisms reduce fe iii to fe ii for respiration under anoxic conditions eq 1 while o2 is converted to h2o2 by both purely chemical pathways fe ii autoxidation eqs 2 and 3 and biotic pathways e g amino acid oxidase catalyzed reactions that result in the two electron reduction of o2 to h2o2 eqs 4 and 5 under oxic conditions then the hydroxyl radical oh which is the key oxidant to degrade contaminants is produced by the interaction of h2o2 with fe ii eq 6 mckinzi and dichristina 1999 han et al 2020 1 f e 3 e microbic anoxic f e 2 2 f e 2 o 2 f e 3 o 2 3 f e 2 o 2 2 h h 2 o 2 f e 3 4 o 2 2 e microbic o 2 5 o 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 6 f e 2 h 2 o 2 oh o h most of the above experiments were conducted within 7 days however compared with these experiments the degradation of ps mps was a long term process and ps mps only displayed 4 6 0 13 weight losses in our previous in situ experiment under alternating anoxic oxic conditions during a 2 month treatment period oh might trigger membrane lipid peroxidation which leads to microbial inactivation zhang et al 2020a incubated a field sediment with shewanella oneidensis mr 1 and treated it for six anoxic oxic cycles every cycle included 117 h anoxic and 6 h oxic periods and six cycles equaled 30 days the number of mr 1 cells decreased by almost 2 orders of magnitude after six anoxic oxic cycles which decreased by almost 0 7 orders of magnitude when the running time reached 14 days the running time of our experiment in this article the number and activity of microorganisms are important for the microbially driven fenton reaction since the decreased number and activity of microorganisms would suppress bioreduction of fe iii in anoxic periods and oh production in oxic periods which would in turn restrain the microbially driven fenton reaction wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a in addition there is a large amount of organic matter in the natural environment that acts as a carbon source for iron reducing bacteria and simultaneously may compete with mps for oh thus whether mps can be continuously degraded by microbially driven fenton reactions and how they are degraded are still unknown therefore this study aimed to evaluate the effect of the microbially driven fenton reaction on mp degradation and to reveal whether microbial inactivation and organic matter influence mp degradation we set up a pure culture system using shewanella putrefaciens 200 as a typical dissimilatory iron reducing bacterium since it is a facultative anaerobic bacterium and abundant in alternating anaerobic aerobic areas mckinzi and dichristina 1999 rotaru et al 2021 ps mps were employed as the model mps and lactate and ferric citrate were utilized to represent the organic matter and the iron oxides in the environment the pathway of ps mp degradation and microbial inactivation by oh generated from microbially driven fenton reactions was also determined knowledge generated from this work will provide new insights for mp risk assessment in natural environments and serve as a basis

particles figure s1 the outer diameter of which ranged from 1 20 to 1 30 mm were purchased from king pearl co tianjin china and dissolved in 0 03 g ml xylene aqueous solution then the dissolved ps solution was evenly poured into glass plates to prepare a piece of ps film with a thickness of 0 20 0 02 mm after 6 h of drying the piece of ps film was rinsed with methanol solvent and deionized water to remove the residual xylene finally the ps film was dried at room temperature and then cut into mp sheets 5 00 0 10 mm in length and 5 00 0 10 mm in width 2 2 pure culture experimental

an od600 of 0 5 the cell culture was allowed to reduce fe iii citrate under anaerobic conditions which was maintained by continuous sparging with nitrogen gas the aerobic condition was initiated by sparging with air lactate with a final concentration of 10 mm was replenished into each reactor every day the temperature and ph were 25 c and 7 0 respectively and 100 10 mg of ps mps was added to each reactor figure s2 the experimental group i e o2 n2 fe s putrefaciens 200 consisted of s putrefaciens 200 batch cultures amended with fe ⅲ under alternating anaerobic aerobic periods of 6 h to confirm that ps mps were degraded by oh which was generated by the s putrefaciens 200 driven fenton reaction five control groups were set as follows 1 the iron free group i e o2 n2 s putrefaciens 200 which replaced fe iii citrate with 10 mm no3 as the electron acceptor 2 the oh quenched group i e o2 n2 fe s putrefaciens 200 oh scavenger in which 120 mm oh scavenging mannitol that could not be

sodium dodecyl sulfate sds for 4 h to remove impurities from the surface and the ps mps were rinsed with deionized water and dried at room temperature then the physicochemical properties of ps mps were analyzed weight loss was measured by an analytical balance me203e mettler toledo switzerland morphological changes were observed by scanning electron microscopy sem su8020 hitachi japan surface hydrophilicity water contact angle wca was determined by a contact angle measuring system oca50 dataphysics germany the structure and chemical properties of ps mps were determined by gel permeation

240ac ms us thermo usa the solution in each reactor was collected after 14 days of operation and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min and then the supernatant was collected and filtered with a 0 22 µm microporous membrane the filtrate was freeze dried in a vacuum freezer alphal 4 dplus christ germany and then dissolved in 5 ml of methylene chloride after being fully dissolved by shaking the filtrate was filtered using a 0 22 µm organic filter membrane the methylene chloride was volatilized by a pressure blowing concentrator and the remaining precipitate was dissolved with methylene chloride again then the dissolved precipitate was detected using gc ms with a db 5 type column and the following heating procedure 50 c for 1 min then increased to 250 c at a rate of 10 c min and kept at 250 c for 5 min 2 4 detection of the microbially driven fenton reaction the fe ii h2o2 and oh concentrations in all reactors were determined without ps mp addition fe ii concentrations were determined with a ferrozine based detection method according to dichristina et al 1992 h2o2 concentrations were determined using an i3 method assay klassen et al 1994 1 ml of solution a consisting of 400 mm ki 50 mm naoh and 170 μm ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate was mixed with an equal volume of solution b consisting of 100 mm potassium hydrogen phthalate after 1 ml of sample was added and reacted in the dark for 5 min the absorbance of the resulting solution was measured at 350 nm to determine the h2o2 concentration sodium benzoate 15 mm was added to all groups to trap oh radicals by forming p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba the cumulative oh concentrations were quantified by measuring the concentration of p hba using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography uhplc ultimate 3000 thermo usa with a c18 column 4 6 250 mm where the uv detection wavelength was 255 nm the mobile phase of uhplc and the product calculation referred to liao et al 2019 2 5 analysis of microbial inactivation the live dead baclight bacterial viability kit invitrogen ca was used to distinguish live and dead cells by staining the stained cells were observed by using confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm lsm880 zeiss germany at least 3 clsm observation areas 650 650 μm for each field of view were selected and the ratio of viable total cells i e percentage of living cells was calculated based on the counting per area obj total via image pro plus 6 0 software xiang et al 2017 the higher the ratio was the stronger the microbial activity the electron transport system activity etsa can characterize the activity of microorganisms in essence this method indirectly indicates microbial activity by measuring microbial respiratory activity some redox dyes are often used as artificial electron acceptors and they are reduced under the action of the microbial electron transport system along with obvious color changes here we used 2 3 5 triphenyltetrazolium chloride ttc as our redox dye which is colorless in the oxidation state ryssov nielsen 1975 ttc can be reduced to 1 3 5 triphenylformazan ttf which is red and insoluble according to relexans 1996 1 ml of bacterial liquid was mixed with 1 5 ml of tris hcl buffer solution 0 5 ml of 0 36 na2so3 solution and 2 ml of 0 4 ttc solution after the bacteria were cultured in an incubator shaker for 30 min 1 ml of 37 formaldehyde was added to terminate the enzyme reaction the above steps were performed in the dark the sample was centrifuged at 4000 g for 5 min at 25 c and then the supernatant was discarded xiao et al 2017 the produced triphenyl formazan was extracted with 5 ml of acetone and the concentration was measured by uv vis spectroscopy at 485 nm n acetylglucosamine nag is one of the monomers of peptidoglycan in bacterial cell walls when cell walls are damaged nag will be released from the damaged cells thus nag concentrations can indirectly indicate the damage degree of cells nagata et al 2003 li et al 2021 potassium ferricyanide k3 fe cn 6 was used as the chromogenic agent the green fe cn 6 3 could be reduced by nag to form the colorless fe cn 6 4 thus the nag content is proportional to the color intensity of the reaction solution according to the modified schales method imoto and yagishita 1971 1 5 ml of bacterial suspension and 2 ml of k3 fe cn 6 solution i e mixture of 0 5 g k3 fe cn 6 and 1 l of 0 5 m na2co3 will be mixed and heated in a boiling water bath for 15 min after cooling the optical density at 420 nm will be read by uv vis spectroscopy 2 6 statistical analysis data analysis was performed with ibm spss statistics 25 0 and the results are presented as the mean or mean sd standard deviation the normal distribution test was taken for original data and under the assumption that the sample was normal the differences among different groups were compared using one way anova followed by bonferroni s test and differences were considered to be significant at p 0 05 midway et al 2020 3 results 3 1 degradation of ps mps by dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria the weight loss of ps mps in our experimental group was 6 1 0 6 within 14 days while the weight loss of the strictly aerobic group was just 1 0 5 and those of the other control groups were even less than 0 5 fig 1 a that is the weight loss of ps mps in the experimental group was over 11 5 times higher than that in the other five control groups the speed of biodegradation and photodegradation of ps was slow table s2 the reason for the slow biodegradation is that the high degree of polymerization of ps prevents it from being used as a substrate for microbial enzymatic reactions ps is a cc backbone polymer that is difficult to hydrolyze thus it is difficult to be transported into microbial cells and microorganisms have difficulty attaching to the surface of ps albertsson et al 1993 krueger et al 2015 virgin ps is not responsive to degradation by ultraviolet uv light because of the presence of phenyl rings in its repeating units which is the reason for its slow photodegradation bandyopadhyay and basak 2007 gpc was employed to analyze the molecular weight of ps mps the polydispersity index pdi mw mn where mw is the average molecular weight and mn is the number average molecular weight can characterize the molecular weight heterogeneity of polymers the larger the pdi value is the wider the molecular weight distribution and the higher the degree of depolymerization as shown in fig 1b after 14 days the pdi of ps mps in the experimental group was 1 9274 which was higher than that in all five control groups thus the gpc results demonstrated that the degree of ps mp depolymerization in the experimental group was the highest sem was applied to directly analyze the surface morphological characteristics of ps mps the surfaces of the pristine ps mp were smooth and after 14 days the surfaces of ps mps in the experimental group had the largest number of cavities among all groups which were up to 0 8 µm in diameter fewer tiny cavities appeared in the strictly aerobic iron free and oh quenched groups than in the group with microbial degradation fig 1c ps mps in the strictly anaerobic and sterile groups had hardly any cavities wca data could reflect the surface hydrophilicity of ps mps fig 1d shows that after 14 days the wca of ps mps in the experimental group was the smallest 63 0 0 6 while those of the other control groups were over 81 6 which indicated that ps mps in the experimental group had the highest hydrophilicity the higher the hydrophilicity was i e the smaller the wca was the greater the degree of degradation was feng et al 2021 waldman and rillig 2020 thus ps mps in the experimental group had the greatest degree of degradation in addition surfaces with higher hydrophilia were more easily colonized by microorganisms which led to improved subsequent degradation previous studies table s2 have shown that the abiotic fenton degraded ps by a 7 37 decrease in wca and a 34 26 increase in the oxygen content of ps surfaces in 48 h such degradation was more rapid than the microbially drive fenton reaction however abiotic fenton needs to artificially add fenton reagents that cannot occur in the natural environment the o c ratio could quantitatively describe the degree of surface degradation of mps after 14 days the o c ratio of the experimental group was 0 6 ratios were 0 10 to 0 17 in the strictly aerobic the iron free and the oh quenched groups and ranged from 0 06 to 0 07 in the strictly anaerobic and the sterile groups in summary the o c ratio of ps mps in the experimental group was over 4 66 times higher than those in the five control groups the increased oxygen content indicated that oxidation took place on ps mps that is the microbially driven fenton reaction most strongly promoted the oxidation of ps mps atr ftir spectroscopy and xps were used to characterize the functional groups and chemical compositions on the surface of ps mps compared to the atr ftir spectra of all control groups three new absorption peaks at 3191 cm 1 1643 cm 1 and 1098 cm 1 which represent the stretching vibrations of oh c o and co respectively appeared in the experimental group fig 2 a xps spectra fig 2b show that the o 1 s peak of ps mps was enhanced most significantly in the experimental group which only increased slightly in the strictly aerobic the iron free and the oh quenched groups and barely increased in the strictly anaerobic and the sterile groups in the c 1 s spectrum of ps mps fig 2c additional co peaks 286 5 ev appeared in the experimental strictly aerobic iron free and oh quenched groups and the intensity of the co peak in the experimental group was highest among all groups in the o 1 s spectra of ps mps fig 2d c o 532 24 ev co 533 12 ev co oh 533 90 ev and o co o 535 41 ev appeared in the experimental strictly aerobic iron free and oh quenched groups while there was no o co o peak in the strictly anaerobic and sterile groups oxygen atoms and oxygen containing functional groups in ps mps indicated that the ps mp surfaces were oxidized during the treatments al abdulal et al 2015 the carbonyl index ci is normally used to characterize the aging degree of plastics and is calculated by the intensity of carbonyl groups relative to the methylene peak rouillon et al 2016 domínguez jaimes et al 2021 liu et al 2019 compared to the control groups the ci in the experimental group was the highest which meant that the aging degree of ps mps in the experimental group was highest table s3 thus the atr ftir and xps items characterized the oxidation degree of ps mps the above data revealed that ps mps in the experimental group had the highest oxidation degree in summary the above multiple parameters revealed that the degree of ps mp degradation in the experimental group was significantly higher than that in all control groups within 14 days 3 2 production of oh by the microbially driven fenton reaction to determine whether the optimal degradation effect of the experimental group was caused by the microbially driven fenton reaction we detected the concentrations of fe ii h2o2 and oh fig 3 a shows that fe ii concentrations increased in the anaerobic stage and decreased in the aerobic stage in the experimental group and the oh quenched group the fe ii concentration was maintained in the range of 8 9 mmol l in the strictly anaerobic group and could hardly be detected in the other control groups indicating that fe ii was mainly produced by microbial anaerobic respiration the fe ii concentrations in the experimental group and the oh quenched group could not be restored to their highest levels unless lactate was replenished which may be a result of the reduced electron donors available to microorganisms and the decreased microbial activities when we measured the h2o2 concentration the original electron acceptor fe iii was replaced by nitrate and the iron free group did not add any electron acceptor fig 3b shows that the h2o2 concentrations in the experimental group and the iron free and oh quenched groups were similar in which h2o2 was generated in the aerobic stage and then slightly decreased in the anaerobic stage the h2o2 content in the strictly aerobic group continued to increase and almost no h2o2 was produced in the strictly anaerobic group and the sterile group indicating that h2o2 was mainly produced in microbial aerobic respiration sodium benzoate was added as an oh trapping agent in all groups to detect the oh concentration bau and kurz 2011 fig 3c shows that the oh concentration in the experimental group continued to rise and the slope of the oh curve in the aerobic stage was higher than that in the anaerobic stage that is the rates of oh production in the aerobic phase were higher than those in the anaerobic phase and the oh yield reached 30 μmol l during 48 h while the yields of oh in the other 5 control groups were all below 3 μmol l combining the results of microbially driven fenton reactions and ps mp degradation the best degradation performance of ps mps in the experimental group was attributed to oh production h2o2 might also have little effect on ps mp degradation since the strictly aerobic group the iron free group and the sterile group had slight ps mp degradation although there was almost no oh generation in these three groups the coexistence of iron reducing bacteria and the alternating anaerobic aerobic environment were essential conditions for the occurrence of microbially driven fenton reactions thus whether microbial activity could be maintained was the premise to maintain stable oh production and ps mp degradation 3 3 oh induced oxidative damage did not affect the microbially driven fenton reaction in the presence of organic carbon source supplements hydroxyl radicals are strong oxidants that may simultaneously cause damage to microorganisms while they oxidize ps mps ahmed et al 2021 to verify whether the microbially driven fenton reaction affected the microbial activity which in turn affected the efficiency of the fenton reaction samples were taken at 6 hour intervals from the experimental the iron free and the oh quenched groups and observed using clsm table 1 shows that proportions of live cells in the iron free and oh quenched groups in which oh could hardly be detected were significantly larger than those in the experimental group suggesting that oh generated by the microbially driven fenton reaction might be harmful to s putrefaciens 200 moreover the contents of etsa and nag in these three groups were also measured to evaluate bacterial damage fig 4 nag is one of the monomers of peptidoglycans in bacterial cell walls that is released when the cell walls are damaged thus larger nag contents represent more serious damage to cell walls etsa was used to evaluate the microbial activity thus larger etsa contents signified less damage after the first 12 h the etsa of the experimental group decreased the most 65 86 0 98 and the nag content increased the most 67 09 1 62 indicating that the experimental group had the highest degree of microbial damage which was in agreement with the clsm results that is oh production in the experimental group indeed caused cell damage although there was no oh production the contents of etsa still decreased and the contents of nag still increased in the iron free and oh quenched groups it was inferred to be caused by h2o2 induced oxidative damage and by the lack of carbon sources i e sodium lactate after a few hours of operation filho and meneghini 1984 cheng et al 2021 carbon sources can promote the growth and reproduction of microorganisms and provide carbon scaffoldings for cells high tides generally occur every 12 h garrett and maas 1993 thus we replenished sodium lactate final concentration 10 mm at 12 h in each group to simulate abundant organic matter brought by high tides as shown in fig 4 the contents of nag in all three groups recovered i e nag decreased to the initial level or even lower than it the contents of etsa in the iron free and oh quenched groups also recovered i e etsa rose to the initial level or even higher than it however the etsa of the experimental group did not immediately change obviously in the following 6 h while at 24 h it recovered to a content level close to that at 6 h according to richardson 2000 during chemoheterotrophic growth on reduced carbon sources the carbon substrate must be oxidized to the level at which it can be assimilated therefore it was inferred that the overdue of the recovery of etsa after adding sodium lactate in the experimental group was because the added sodium lactate had not been oxidized to the assimilable level in the following 6 h these results indicated that the lack of a carbon source led to cell damage in the iron free and oh quenched groups and both oh induced oxidative damage and the lack of a carbon source caused cell damage in the experimental group in which oh induced oxidative damage was the primary reason since the etsa content in the experimental group could not recover in a timely manner zhang et al 2020a incubated a field sediment with shewanella oneidensis mr 1 and operated the experiment for six anoxic oxic cycles in nearly one month without extra carbon resources added and they found that the generated oh affected mr 1 activity by damaging cell membranes which further decreased fe iii bioreduction in the anoxic period which would in turn have a negative effect on oh production our experiment also demonstrated cell damage however the damage did not obviously affect oh production fig 3c since we replenished lactate in the culture every day mannitol used as an oh scavenger cannot act as a carbon source to affect the growth rate of microorganisms sekar and dichristina 2014 the concentration of mannitol was high enough to quench the vast majority of oh in the system the oh concentration in the o2 n2 fe s putrefaciens 200 oh scavenger group was under 3 μmol l while in the experimental group it was approximately 30 μmol l during 48 h which is why we chose mannitol as the scavenger of oh for strict control in the previous experiment in natural sediments there are many quenched molecules for oh which may also act as carbon sources such as lactate groussard et al 2000 in the natural environment with alternating anaerobic aerobic conditions such as the intertidal zone chen et al 2021 organic carbon sources can be continuously provided by the water flow which is similar to the continuous lactate addition in our experiment that is oh can be continuously generated by the microbially driven fenton reaction in the natural environment in the natural environment with alternating anaerobic aerobic conditions such as the intertidal zone chen et al 2021 organic carbon sources can be continuously provided by the water flow which is similar to the continuous lactate addition in our experiment that is oh can be continuously generated by the microbially driven fenton reaction in the natural environment 3 4 possible degradation pathway of ps mps by the microbially driven fenton reaction a large amount of low molecular weight organic matter would be produced during ps mp degradation biale et al 2021 thus we detected the water soluble low molecular weight products of ps mps by gc ms to analyze the degradation pathway to focus on the effect of oh produced by the microbially driven fenton reaction and avoid interference from the medium and microbial metabolites we set the experimental group the sterile group and the ps free group i e a group without ps mps under the same conditions as the experimental group the gc spectra of water soluble low molecular weight intermediates extracted from the medium after 14 days are shown in figure s2 compared with the ps free group the experimental group and the sterile group had more peaks of low molecular products peaks in the experimental group were most obvious and had the largest number peaks in the sterile group represented low molecular weight organic matter from the medium and the microbial metabolites compared to the sterile group the experimental group had more peaks such as the peak appearing at 9 12 min and the peak appearing at 23 63 min based on the unique ability of ms to identify unknown compounds we used ms to further analyze the products separated by gc the corresponding substances at peak times of 9 12 min and 23 63 min were two benzene ring derivatives 2 isopropyl 5 methyl 1 heptanol and nonahexacontanoic acid respectively which likely came from the low molecular weight products generated by the chain dispolymerization of long chain molecules of ps mps the possible depolymerization pathway of ps mps fig 5 by the microbially driven fenton reaction was analyzed by combining atr ftir xps and gc ms data bianco et al 2020 shang et al 2003 krueger et al 2017 then the chain breaking in normal and weak chains produced terminal radicals which could effectively react with the molecular oxygen to form the peroxy radical the peroxy radical formed stable groups on the chains of polymer molecules such as oh through hydrogen abstraction after recombination and other reactions such as the radical addition reaction oh transformed to cooh c o and other groups with the prolongation of reaction time and the deepening of reaction intensity many low molecular weight products e g 2 isopropyl 5 methyl 1 heptanol and nonahexacontanoic acid were produced in succession a previous study esplugas et al 2002 showed that oh could not only attack the long chains on the benzene rings but also cleave the benzene rings studies on the kinetic constant found that limiting factors of oh production by fenton reaction were amounts of h2o2 and fe ii neyens and baeyens 2003 naffrechoux et al 2000 in the microbially driven fenton reaction the amounts of h2o2 and fe ii depend on the number and activity of microorganisms therefore this ps degradation process by the microbially driven fenton reaction is considered to be sustainable as long as the microorganisms are activated and electron donors are adequate that is ps can be completely degraded by the microbially driven fenton reaction 3 5 implications in natural alternating anaerobic aerobic environments such as the intertidal zone and the paddy field carbon sources can be constantly provided by the water flow the analysis of microbial inactivation in our study proved that microorganisms were indeed damaged by oh however the oh production in the experimental group was not affected due to the timely replenishment of organic carbon sources which could promote the growth and reproduction of microorganisms and consequently maintain the activity of microbial populations even if it does not work immediately thus damage by oh on microorganisms can be repaired and the continuous production of oh can be maintained in the above natural environments extraction and identification of mps is the first step in the risk assessment of mps which involves investigation of the mp distribution in the natural environment wet peroxide oxidation wpo with h2o2 and fe ii is a common and cost effective method to degrade organic matter in sediments before the extraction and identification of mps from sediment samples zhang et al 2020b monteiro et al 2022 our results showed that even in the presence of abundant organic matter oh can attack mps and change their physical and chemical properties including functional groups oxygen containing groups and o c ratios and then affect risk assessment prata et al 2019 thus based on our results if we only investigate the amount and types of mps in sediments the effects of h2o2 and oh in the preprocessing steps could be ignored however if the weight and physicochemical properties of mps should also be investigated the effects of h2o2 and oh used in the sample pretreatment should be taken into account microbial technology is considered an environmentally friendly treatment for plastic waste although the microbial degradation rate is prolonged previous studies on the microbial degradation of plastics have focused on looking for specific microorganisms that can synthesize and secrete plastic degrading enzymes these microorganisms excrete extracellular enzymes such as alkane hydroxylases and hydroquinone peroxidases to depolymerize plastic including ps polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polyvinyl chloride pvc polyurethane pur and polyethylene terephthalate pet into short polymer intermediates which are ultimately assimilated by microbes as carbon sources asmita et al 2015 moharir and kumar 2018 shah et al 2008 jadaun et al 2022 our study provides a new mechanism for microbial plastic degradation that is different from that of previous microbial degradation the fenton reaction could be driven by many facultative anaerobic iron reducing microorganisms e g shewanella sp pseudomonas sp and bacillus sp etc which are more common than special microorganisms that secrete plastic degrading enzymes koch and harnisch 2016 logan et al 2019 thus these findings also provide new insights into broadening the library of known bacterial types for the microbial degradation of plastics 4 conclusion this work reveals that the microbially driven fenton reaction under alternating anaerobic aerobic conditions can be continuously applied to mp degradation within 14 days the weight loss of ps mps in the experimental group i e o2 n2 fe s putrefaciens 200 and the o c ratio were the highest in all six groups confirming that mp degradation was a consequence of oh produced by the microbially driven fenton reaction benzene ring derivatives such as 2 isopropyl 5 methyl 1 heptanol and nonahexacontanoic acid were the water soluble low molecular weight products of mp degradation oh can be continuously produced when there is replenishment of organic carbon sources to promote the reproduction of microorganisms this study provides direct evidence for the role of the microbially driven fenton reaction in mp degradation in nature and broadens the available bacterial types for microbial plastic degradation appendix a supplementary data supplementary data to this article can be found online at https declaration of

15567,urban wet weather discharges from combined sewer overflows cso and stormwater outlets swo are a potential pathway for micropollutants trace contaminants to surface waters posing a threat to the environment and possible water reuse applications despite large efforts to monitor micropollutants in the last decade the gained information is still limited and scattered in a metastudy we performed a data driven analysis of measurements collected at 77 sites 683 events 297 detected micropollutants over the last decade to investigate which micropollutants are most relevant in terms of 1 occurrence and 2 potential risk for the aquatic environment 3 estimate the minimum number of data to be collected in monitoring studies to reliably obtain concentration estimates and 4 provide

release and transport processes mainly driven by rainfall gooré bi et al 2015 hence a great number of samples needs to be collected before knowledge of the pollution levels from a specific site is established with confidence bertrand krajewski et al 2002 burton and pitt 2001 mccarthy et al 2018 furthermore uncertainty in sampling and chemical analysis affects the results however the high costs and resource requirements create barriers to extensive data collection these practical limitations are reflected by the fact that single monitoring studies report a relatively small number of data compared to other traditional pollutants such as total suspended solids phosphorus or nitrogen lee et al 2007 mccarthy et al 2018 métadier and bertrand krajewski 2012 studies on micropollutants typically sample between 1 and 12 events based on spahr et al 2020 and table 1 single published datasets analyzed individually do not allow broader conclusions on micropollutant occurrences in urban areas and the planning of optimal monitoring strategies targeting multiple sites there are examples of review studies that collected and compiled measurements from different studies brudler et al 2019 göbel et al 2007 petrie 2021 spahr et al 2020 but little focus has been put into an overarching statistical analysis of the datasets and its implications for future monitoring efforts our study aims to gain new insights from past monitoring and improve the foundation for planning future monitoring campaigns targeting micropollutants in urban wet weather flows our analysis builds upon a data driven analysis of monitoring data collected from multiple sites over the last decade specifically we i investigated the occurrence of micropollutants found in wet weather flows ii assessed the potential risk that they might pose to the water environment and iii analyzed the variability of the collected data both across discharge events and sites to estimate an indicative number of events and sites needed for reliable information on micropollutant concentrations for individual sites as well as several urban catchments finally we summarized these outcomes to iv provide recommendations for designing future monitoring programs that maximize the usefulness of the collected information overall this study will create the basis for a more effective collection of data on micropollutants in wet weather flows enabling more effective management in tackling this environmental challenge 2 materials and methods 2 1 data on micropollutants in urban wet weather flows for our data analysis we considered data from both urban wet weather discharge types combined sewer overflows cso from combined sewer systems and stormwater outlets swo from separate sewer systems we selected only datasets collected after 2010 and those for which we were able to get access to the raw data the data and code are accessible via https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 6808401 we choose only datasets collected with composite sampling meaning the collection of several sub samples per event pooled together into a composite sample and reported as event mean concentration emc the average concentration in a rainfall runoff event the analyzed emc data were collected with time flow or volume proportional sampling table 1 in addition we considered data from passive sampling designed for sampling of wet weather events mutzner et al 2019 pooling data obtained from different sampling strategies limits comparability among studies and thus causes additional uncertainty e g mccarthy and harmel 2014 however given the few available datasets we assume that the advantage of learnings from a collected dataset outweighs the disadvantages our study did not consider datasets with limited data representatively e g grab sampling or unclear sampling strategies the collected data originate from 77 sites 36 cso 41 swo table 1 and include 683 events and 610 total micropollutants while swo data from three continents were europe australia usa the data for cso are only from europe some of the collected datasets also reported other water quality indicators nutrients pathogens which were not included in the scope of this study the r package webchem szöcs et al 2020 was used to find unique cas chemical abstracts service numbers for the micropollutants as different names and cas numbers were used across published studies nevertheless there might be some overlap in the full list of 610 micropollutants the full dataset was then cleaned by considering micropollutants at least found once higher than the limit of quantification loq and by a final manual check leading to 297 micropollutants including heavy metals a total of 34 266 emc observations including those below loq were considered in the analysis fig 1 and si fig a 1 the number of micropollutants found varies considerably among monitored sites and events ranging from 13 to 214 micropollutants and 1 to 35 events per site si fig a 2 2 2 sample preparation and chemical analysis the studies listed in table 1 are based on different sample preparation methods and chemical analyses the detailed chemical analysis and preparation procedures can be found in the original publications table 1 for micropollutant concentrations that were measured as filtered dissolved and not filtered total the total was taken for further calculations heavy metals hydrophobic chemicals for compounds only measured in dissolved not filtered form the dissolved concentration was taken accordingly the environmental quality standard eqs was also considered for the total concentration see details in section 2 4 the differences in sample preparation and chemical analysis can influence the comparison among sites which can falsely suggest a different emission situation due to differences in loq loqs vary among studies and measured micropollutant concentrations range from below ng l to µg l a comparison of loq with eqs shows that for seven out of the nine considered studies loq was higher than eqs for selected micropollutants for 40 micropollutants eqs was smaller than the corresponding loq for selected sites for min 1 max 30 sites si figs a 3 and a 4 in these cases low concentrations close to eqs might not be detected this highlights the challenge faced by existing chemical analysis methodologies in detecting relevant micropollutants in urban wet weather flows 2 3 data pre processing summary statistics including values below the limit of quantification the compiled datasets contain a large number of observations below loq with 51 4 left censored observations see also section 3 1 the data were pre processed to estimate summary statistics taking into account left censored observations loq micropollutants that were not found below detection limit in any samples were considered as not applicable na in the data pre processing when estimating summary statistics when at least 3 emc observations were available and less than 80 of the data were left censored summary statistics were computed for all sites combined as well as for individual sites fig 1 summary statistics were computed by using regression on order statistics ros as detailed in helsel 2011 based on the r package nada lee 2020 first the data were log transformed and then weibull type plotting positions of censored and uncensored observations were calculated linear regression was fitted to the uncensored observations this regression model was then used to estimate the concentration of the observations below loq based on their normal quantiles ros was done for each site and micropollutant separately a visual check of the results confirmed a good fit for the linear regression for most sites with r2 0 5 and a significance of p 0 05 for 85 of all micropollutants per site for each micropollutant and site the ros summary statistics mean was used as site mean concentration smcsite the calculated smcsite is thus the mean of the measured concentrations and it is not weighted with the volume of the event as often done in other studies e g mccarthy et al 2018 the comparison of mean to median per micropollutant and site resulted in an 80 interquantile range of 0 96 to 2 3 confirming that for most micropollutants the data are skewed and a lognormal distribution is more suitable than a normal distribution si fig a 5 overall there were sufficient data for 223 micropollutants 30 659 emc observations which could be used to calculate summary statistics across all sites while for 186 micropollutants site specific summary statistics smcsite were possible fig 1 due to few observations and high censoring no smcsite summary statistics could be computed for 72 of the smcsite observations these measurements were only used to assess the contaminant occurrence at a site section 3 1 without concentration estimates all calculations and graphics were done in r 4 0 3 r core team 2020 using tidyverse incl ggplot2 and nada lee 2020 wickham 2016 wickham et al 2019 2 4 micropollutants occurrences and risk quotients micropollutants were classified into five chemical classes with diverse urban sources ranging from household wastewater to street runoff table 2 we assessed which micropollutants i are often found if searched for per site occurrence and ii are found in concentrations above exiting eqs risk quotient distinguishing between cso and swo we calculated the occurrence by looking at the number of sites where a substance was found at least once loq we then calculated occurrence as the number of detections at least once loq at a site and normalized it by the number of sites where the substance was searched section 2 2 for discussion on loq variability the environmental risk was assessed by calculating a risk quotient rq based on a precautionary 90 percentile of the concentration over all sites estimated from the ros summary statistics divided by chronic eqs for surface freshwaters if no chronic eqs was available acute eqs was used critical concentrations in receiving waters are assumed to potentially occur if rq 1 i e dilution in receiving waters is needed to avoid environmental impacts the use of chronic eqs ensures a more conservative assessment as chronic eqs are lower than acute eqs also even though acute eqs would be more appropriate to judge the risk of a single discharge event their definition definition of event sampling duration etc remains unclear the applied eqs originate from the eu directive annual average eqs the us environmental protection agency us epa and from national water quality standards from denmark and switzerland eu directive 2013 39 2013 miljø 2017 the swiss federal council 1998 us epa 2022 in addition eqs recommended by the swiss ecotox center were used swiss centre ecotox 2021 if more than one eqs value was available the lowest value was taken eqs could be defined for 117 of the 297 micropollutants si table a 2 for micropollutants without eqs no risk quotient was calculated and these micropollutants were not considered for the risk ranking section 3 2 2 5 resampling of measured emc concentrations to estimate the number of events and sites needed 2 5 1 number of events needed for site mean concentration estimate the number of events needed to reliably estimate a site mean concentration smcsite depends on the variability at the specific site i e the inter event variability of measured emcs emcsite bertrand krajewski et al 2002 burton and pitt 2001 mccarthy et al 2018 this variability can be described by the coefficient of variation cvemc site calculated as the standard deviation of emcsite divided by the mean of emcsite i e smcsite fig 2 a differences among coefficient of variations per wet weather discharge type and chemical class were evaluated with one way anova analysis analyzed for homoscedasticity and a tukey s honestly significant difference test for pairwise comparisons was done in r r core team 2020 we evaluated the effect of sampling a limited number of events by drawing subsets of events from the site specific emcsite lognormal distributions for a given micropollutant obtained from the ros summary statistics section 2 3 the following bootstrapping procedure was applied for each micropollutant for the second resampling approach fig 2b 1 a population of 10 000 emcsite values for a given micropollutant and site j was generated from lognormal distributions these lognormal distributed values were calculated with the r package envstats millard 2013 using the mean of emcsite smcsite and the coefficient of variation of emcsite cvemc site from the ros analysis 2 a subset of n random emcsite n values were drawn from the population step 1 without replacement varying the number of drawn events n from 1 to 300 3 for each number of events n subset the smcj n per site j was calculated and then compared to the true smcsite 4 step 2 and 3 were repeated 1 000 times enabling the estimation of the 95 confidence interval of the ratio smcj n smcsite step 3 for different number of events n grey points in fig 2b 5 the error in the smcj n estimation per number of drawn events was calculated by the error bandwidth of the 95 confidence interval of smcj n smcsite red line in fig 2b 6 we identified the number of events needed to estimate smcsite based on an error band width of 0 5 and 1 green arrows in fig 2b 2 5 2 number of sites needed for micropollutants emission estimate among sites urban catchments differ in aspects such as size sewer system topography land use and substance use therefore there is an inherent variability among catchments and wet weather discharge sites which challenges the estimation of micropollutant emissions from wet weather flows at the city river catchment scale where a large number of discharge sites is often present thus an indication of the number of sites needed to account for this inter site variability will help urban water managers to decide on future monitoring programs and allow model based predictions the estimation of a typical smc range of a specific micropollutant in cso and swo requires a minimum number of sites to be monitored for this analysis the coefficient of variation cvsmc was calculated based on the mean smctot and standard deviation of available smcsite values fig 2a data from swo and cso were analyzed separately and micropollutants with less than 3 sites with summary statistics were removed this resulted in a total of 160 smctot 47 cso and 113 swo the exploration of smcsite indicated that the root squared transformation to avoid negative values of smcsite of smcsite per micropollutant follows a normal distribution for the resampling of the sites we followed the following procedure 1 for each micropollutant per swo and cso site a population of 10 000 random normal distributed root squared transformed smcsite was generated 2 a subset of j random smcsite values was drawn from the population without replacement varying the number of drawn sites j from 1 to 200 3 for each j th subset the smctot j value was calculated and then compared to smctot 4 step 2 and 3 were repeated 1 000 times enabling the estimation of the 95 confidence interval of the ratio smctot j smctot step 3 for each site j 5 the error of each j th smctot j estimation was calculated based on the error band width of the 95 confidence interval smctot j smctot 6 we identified the number of sites needed to estimate smctot for an error band width of 0 5 and 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 micropollutants occurrence in cso and swo the percentage of left censored values is higher in swo with 57 censored emc observations than 29 in cso table 3 this difference in censoring could be explained by the larger number of micropollutants searched in swo than in cso about 24 000 and 10 000 observations respectively including micropollutants that are rare in swo e g ppcps chemical classes differ in the number of searched micropollutants pesticides are the largest group of searched pollutants in swo and household industrial in cso the percentage of left censored observations varies from 2 for hm in swo to 83 for ppcps in swo in general there is a clear trend that chemical classes that are expected in wastewater ppcps household industrial have fewer left censored values in cso than in swo hm are almost always found in both system types si fig a 1 some micropollutants were searched in almost all sites cso and swo as shown in fig 3 full list in si b diuron for example was found at 72 sites 34 cso and 41 swo highlighting the importance of cso and swo contributions of this pesticide some micropollutants are predominantly found in cso such as pharmaceuticals from domestic wastewater carbamazepine diclofenac and triclosan nevertheless micropollutants typically associated with domestic wastewater are also found in swo carbamazepine or diclofenac this suggests connections of household wastewater to storm sewers leaky sewer systems or illegal dumping also some pesticides such as mecoprop metolachlor and terbutryn are detected more often in cso than in swo the detection frequency is linked to country and catchment specific use patterns for example terbutryn was searched but never found in swos in australia or fipronil was found only in swo in the united states hence country specific patterns influence the selection of micropollutants for monitoring among the 80 most found micropollutants 26 do not have eqs marked black in fig 3 and no evaluation of the risk quotient was possible section 3 2 on the other hand of the 40 most found micropollutants almost all have eqs available overall 180 micropollutants found at least once loq have no eqs values micropollutants often found can be important to consider for future monitoring and regulators especially when they show a high occurrence list of found searched in si b the results of this graph depend on what has been looked for in the first place for instance cholesterol has only been looked for in swo but most likely it would be present in all cso sites 3 2 top list of micropollutants based on occurrences and risk quotient for many sites micropollutants were detected but in an insufficient number of events to allow the estimation smcsite as among the over 34 000 emc observations 51 4 were left censored moreover in some studies eqs values were below their corresponding loq for 40 micropollutants hitting a maximum of 30 sites with loq eqs for estradiol si fig a 4 comparing occurrence with the risk quotient rq allows to prioritize micropollutants to be considered in future monitoring campaigns and regulations fig 4 31 cso and 31 swo micropollutants showed high occurrence found in over 50 of the sites where they were searched for and a rq bigger than one upper right grass green zone in fig 4 among these top listed micropollutants the top ten micropollutants in cso are from the highest rq cypermethrin ibuprofen benzo a pyrene estradiol copper zinc pyrene fluoranthene estrone pfos in swo the top ten micropollutants are benzo a pyrene fluoranthene pyrene copper zinc mercury benzo b fluoranthene chrysene benzo ghi perylene dibenz ah antracene thus the highest rq are found for metals and pahs with cso sites additionally adding selected pesticides ppcps and household industrial our ranking based on measurements at the discharge point overlaps with studies investigating measured concentrations and environmental risk in receiving waters the analysis of johnson et al 2017 identified copper aluminium zinc ethinylestradiol linearalkylbenzene sulfonate triclosan manganese iron methomyl and chlorpyrifos as the micropollutants posing the highest risk for aquatic organisms in uk rivers although these data are limited to one country the uk not included in our analysis and not necessarily collected during wet weather conditions this confirms that some critical micropollutants e g copper zinc and chloropyrifos have a relevant source in urban wet weather flows our data based ranking also overlaps with a previous assessment based on micropollutants sources and inherent properties the recommendation for swo monitoring by eriksson et al 2007 included metals cadmium chromium copper nickel lead platinium and zinc pahs naphthalene pyrene benzo a pyrene pesticides pendimethalin phenmedipham pentachlorophenol glyphosate and terbuthylazine and household industrial nonylphenol ethoxylates dehp pcb 28 and methyl tert butyl ether this has a high agreement for metals some pahs and household industrial fig 4 however we calculated rq 0 1 for glyphosate and naphthalene phenmedipham pcb 28 and methyl tert butyl ether were not searched for in the analyzed studies while no eqs values were available for pendimethalin found at 46 of swo sites the highlighted micropollutants with rq 1 cover different chemical classes pesticides household industrial pahs heavy metals and ppcps fig 5 showing how various urban sources ranging from household and industrial wastewater to street runoff potentially contribute to environmental impacts based on life cycle analysis a previous study indicated that 97 of the ecotoxicity impacts from swo discharges can be attributed to heavy metals brudler et al 2019 our analysis based on the comparison against eqs confirms that heavy metals are relevant but also that additional micropollutants are relevant when looking at all potential environmental impacts of wet weather flows overall when monitoring csos and swos to assess environmental risks a comprehensive micropollutants list of 31 for cso and swo can be prioritized rq 1 and occurrence 50 fig 4 under consideration of country and site specific contaminant bans or detection of illicit discharges the comparison of micropollutants with rq 1 for cso and swo fig 5 shows that 22 micropollutants are relevant for both systems ppcps are mainly relevant in cso diclofenac ibuprofen estradiol estrone several pesticides have a high rq 1 in swo only carbendazim imidacloprid chlorpyrifos pentachlorophenol however these pesticides also occur in cso and in selected sites concentrations can be higher than eqs while most of the highlighted micropollutants were found at a large number of swo and cso sites fig 3 others such as the pesticides diflufenican and cypermethrin were measured and found only at two cso sites hence increased data collection could confirm the relevance of these micropollutants nevertheless there might be overlooked micropollutants that might be highly relevant but do not have an eqs yet this can be the case for micropollutants with high occurrence shown in fig 3 e g some pfas organophosphates or nicotine or micropollutants that have not yet been reported in stormwater in addition the risk quotient does not take into account transformation products which in some cases could be more toxic than initial compounds therefore if the focus of a monitoring campaign lies in identifying urban sources the above top list can be extended with micropollutants showing high occurrence 3 3 the variability of wet weather flows informs monitoring strategy 3 3 1 variability among events and sites variability among events the measured emcs are highly variable among events with cvemc site 80 interquantile ranging from 0 3 to 1 3 for swo and 0 3 to 1 4 for cso median swo 0 6 median cso 0 7 this variability among events is associated with the inherent variability due to rainfall substance use patterns sources and urban land use gasperi et al 2014 mutzner et al 2020 rippy et al 2017 wicke et al 2021 although our analysis used datasets with experimentally reliable procedures sampling and chemical analysis the influence of data quality on the observed variability cannot be fully excluded our estimates of cvemc for micropollutants are lower than those reported for traditional pollutants cvemc total suspended solids 1 8 conductivity 1 6 cod 1 1 total nitrogen 1 3 in lee et al 2007 in swo also mccarthy et al 2018 found a higher variability with cvemc values of 0 7 to 1 3 for total nitrogen and 1 4 to 2 4 for total suspended solids the higher cvemc for total suspended solids than total nitrogen and micropollutants in our study is an indication that the variability is pollutant specific however more events per site will need to be collected as we cannot exclude that the lower number of monitored events leads to the lower cvemc in our study the variability of cvemc might be different if more events had been monitored however no clear trend between the number of measured events and cvemc was found si fig a 6 and it is thus difficult to estimate what the true cvemc would be a one way anova of cvemc for swo versus cso sites indicates significant differences p 0 003 si a section 2 1 also the median cvemc is slightly higher for cso which could be explained by the mixing of storm and wastewater and the temporal storage of flows adding additional variability hence the minimum number of events to sample for reliable results is slightly different for swo and cso section 3 3 2 the comparison of cvemc with chemical classes shows slight differences for both swo and cso fig 6 a and p 0 001 in one way anova si a section 2 2 in the case of swo a tukey comparison shows that this difference is mainly due to pesticides versus heavy metals and household industrial chemicals heavy metals 0 54 and household industrial 0 59 related micropollutants in swo have lower cvemc than pesticides 0 79 the higher cvemc for pesticides may be related to the local variability in usage sources rainfall and seasonality for pesticides in addition the tukey comparison shows differences between pah and heavy metals for swo which is not the case for cso for cso the differences among cvemc are due to pesticides versus heavy metals household industrial and pahs pesticides in cso have a higher cvemc of 0 80 than other chemical classes with cvemc ranging from 0 62 household industrial 0 66 ppcp pah to heavy metals 0 67 variability among sites sufficient information was available more than two sites with smcsite to calculate smctot for 48 micropollutants for cso and 117 for swo fig 6b the median cvsmc was higher for swo 0 9 than for cso 0 6 si fig a 13 an anova analysis shows a significant difference between cvsmc for cso versus swo p 0 01 si a section 3 1 the larger variability for swo might be explained by the higher variability of storm driven micropollutants due to differences in catchment size land use and substance use while not evaluated as part of this study future research could include these and other watershed characteristics to determine their influence if any on resulting pollutant concentrations the variability among sites is also influenced by systematic differences among sampling strategies and chemical analysis in the studies which could induce additional variability among sites however the variability among sites could in part also be caused by the few events collected for some sites among continents minor differences among cvsmc for swo were found median cvsmc europe 0 69 australia 0 64 united states 0 74 si fig a 18 with no significant differences revealed by an anova analysis the continent specific cvsmc is lower than the overall cvsmc for swo of 0 9 showing that local differences influence cvsmc hence a lower variability can be expected for a catchment or country specific study the comparison of cvsmc highlights distinct differences among chemical classes showing larger variability among sites for certain classes fig 6b the one way anova analysis for swo versus chemical classes p 0 0001 si a section 3 2 shows that pahs have a large influence on the observed differences with a high median cvsmc pahs 1 6 and hm 1 2 a previous study in the us showed that although the range of concentrations can vary commercial parking lots and residential driveways exceed all other source areas often by one or two orders of magnitude selbig 2009 in the case of cso pesticides have a higher median cvsmc 1 05 and the differences in the one way anova analysis p 0 006 are attributed to pesticides versus pahs the observed differences in cvsmc could also be related to the smaller sample size for pesticides and more data would be needed to clarify the observed patterns 3 3 2 how many events should be sampled the resampling results show the dependency between the number of events to be sampled and cvemc fig 7 a with an increasing number of events needed for higher variability in emc as the cvemc depends on the chemical class fig 6 the number of events to be sampled is different depending on the analyzed micropollutant si a section 2 3 based on our resampling procedure a median number of events of 7 results for cso 80 interquantile of 2 to 31 events for all analyzed cvemc fig 7a1 and 6 for swo 80 interquantile of 1 to 25 events for all analyzed cvemc fig 7a1 if the error band width is set to 0 5 the median number of events increases to 28 and 25 for cso and swo respectively fig 7a2 however there is a large variability among the number of required events depending on the analyzed site and thus fig 7 can be used to determine the number of required events based on local conditions and substance selection in comparison mccarthy et al 2018 estimated a higher average number of required events for traditional pollutants in swo of 27 total suspended solids 12 e coli and total nitrogen 11 error band width of 1 a theoretical calculation assuming normally distributed data by burton and pitt 2001 estimated 20 events for a cvemc of 0 4 error band width of 0 5 which is higher than our estimate of a median of 10 events for a cvemc of 0 4 a potential explanation for the lower number of events in our study could be the difference in methodology where we assume that the data are log normal distributed moreover even though the studies considered in our analysis are among the most comprehensive found in literature the number of measured events was lower than the estimated required events for 40 of the smcsite observations si fig a 10 thus our estimation of the number of events to be monitored may be biased moreover our analysis used only data from sites with sufficient data points for statistical inference in case of a large number of censored data points more events would be needed to determine a reliable smcsite 3 3 3 how many sites should be sampled the number of sites required to obtain a reliable estimate of the range of smcsite considering the full dataset used in this study 4 sites for cso 80 interquantile of 2 to 16 and 10 sites for swo 80 interquantile of 3 to 22 for an error band width of 1 around smctot fig 7b1 the number of required sites increases considerably for an error band width of 0 5 around smctot with 18 cso and 41 swo sites si a section 3 3 the differences between cso and swo sites relate to the higher variability of cvsmc among swo sites section 3 3 1 however considering only one continent the median number of required sites is lower due to a lower cvsmc per continent 0 6 to 0 74 than the overall cvsmc of 0 9 moreover the required number of sites depends on the catchment of interest where the number of sites is limited and which is subject to different environmental regulations climatic conditions use patterns and design criteria these results have to be interpreted carefully as 43 of all micropollutants have fewer sites measured than would be necessary according to our analysis for a reliable estimate of smctot si fig a 17 this is especially the case for swo where 66 out of 117 micropollutants 56 have not enough sites monitored in the case of cso this is the case for only 6 micropollutants out of 48 13 in general more sites per micropollutant have been monitored for cso than swo median 12 cso sites and 8 cso sites in conclusion the obtained results for cso seem to be more reliable than for swo and the number of required sites is lower for cso than swo here the importance of monitoring a sufficient number of sites is shown which will enable a model estimate of pollution levels for an urban catchment or river stretch however there are some substance specific considerations micropollutants with high cvsmc require a much larger number of sites with sometimes more sites needed for cso than for swo for instance the estimation of smctot for diuron requires the monitoring of 25 cso and 14 swo sites this also shows how for selected contaminants the number of sites to monitor is significantly higher than our average values reported above these high site numbers may also indicate micropollutants with high variations linked to regional or land use patterns for example wicke et al 2021 highlighted high differences in building based biocides diuron and mecoprop between french and german sites probably due to regional product preferences in these cases the estimation of a minimum number of sites is very challenging based on the currently available data 3 4 discussing the future of monitoring micropollutants in wet weather flows based on the survey of data from the monitoring campaigns that have been published in the last decade and their outcomes we identified several learnings for future monitoring campaigns and regulations of wet weather flows which substances should we measure and regulate 1 our data driven analysis highlights micropollutants with high occurrence and risk quotient to focus on in regulatory and research monitoring campaigns thus ensuring that efforts and resources are maximized clearly this general list will need to be adapted to the local conditions as the prioritization could be affected by site specific factors such as industrial production and land usage use habits and country specific regulations the analyzed data are based on a selected developed countries and the transferability of the results to other countries depends on local product preferences and use patterns also the top listed micropollutants are subject to change over time as new products are brought to the market while others are substituted or banned this is especially relevant for micropollutants used in household products and found in domestic wastewater where product composition and usage pattern can change over time for mainly stormwater based micropollutants the evolution over time is buffered as building materials or vehicles create a stock of micropollutants 2 selected non target screening for future stormwater quality monitoring is needed to update the top list with new micropollutants of emerging concern such as the tire rubber chemical 6 ppd quinone tian et al 2021 moreover access to consumer data and communication with product regulators could lead to targeted monitoring of micropollutants of potential concern 3 micropollutants are often grouped into chemical classes however the top lists from our study show the occurrence of micropollutants belonging to different groups this suggests that monitoring efforts should target different classes as one class does not cover the whole toxicity spectrum and or the diversity of urban sources also to reduce the resource requirements it is beneficial to identify indicator micropollutants i e proxies of other substances that are representative of specific sources transport mechanisms environmental behavior and or land usages to reduce analytical efforts in case of limited resources launay et al 2016 mutzner et al 2020 although this was not performed in this study the collected data can provide the information basis for such future analysis how much should we measure 1 micropollutants at concentrations of potential risk for aquatic organisms are found in both cso and swo thus the assessment of surface water status requires the consideration of both wet weather fluxes 2 the analysis indicates the number of events for wet weather flow monitoring of cso 2 to 31 for events 80 interquantile range median 7 and swo 1 to 25 events for 80 interquantile range median 6 that need to be monitored to draw reliable conclusions error band width of 1 for smcsite for selected chemical classes pesticides for cso and swo pahs for swo or expected high variability cvemc the number of events needs to be chosen higher moreover also for individual micropollutants the number of events can differ considerably from the estimated median number of events si fig a 11 and fig 7 can be used to estimate the number of events 3 the observed high number of censored values in the collected data 50 stresses the importance to redesign future wet weather monitoring programs by improving current sample preparation and chemical analysis this is highlighted by a considerable number of micropollutants 40 of 117 where eqs was smaller than loq in some studies 4 reliable sampling and chemical analysis are essential for robust statistical inference for example the variability among events estimated in our work expressed as cvemc was lower than previously reported for traditional pollutants lee et al 2007 mccarthy et al 2018 while there is some indication that the variability is pollutant specific we do not know if the lower variability in our study is also related to the small number of events monitored at some sites 5 most urban catchments and surface waters have a large number of wet weather discharge sites thus we need to know how many sites would need to be monitored to allow a model prediction for all discharge sites based on our full dataset covering different countries our analysis indicates that a minimum of 4 cso 80 interquantile of 2 to 16 and 10 swo 80 interquantile of 3 to 22 sites need to be monitored to estimate a typical range of smctot an error band width of 1 however the required number of sites depends on the catchment of interest for which typically the number of sites is limited and local conditions regarding environmental regulations climatic conditions use patterns and design criteria are more constant hence the required minimum number of sites gives the first indication if there is a lack of local monitoring data generally a monitoring program has to be planned carefully to cover a diversity of typical land use types especially for chemical classes with high variability among sites pah heavy metals pesticides 6 the concept of smc implies the hypothesis of stationarity of the pollutant release processes throughout the monitoring period however pollutant sources in the catchment can change due to e g changes in the human activities industries in the catchment banning of specific substances etc this stresses the importance of adapting the monitoring program to the knowledge of the pollutant sources in the catchment what else do we need to take into account 1 in our risk evaluation we compared event mean concentrations emc with eqs for surface waters however most eqs values are not designed for short term minutes to hours wet weather flows and not all micropollutants with high occurrence have eqs values therefore new risk assessment tools specifically targeting wet weather flows are needed to evaluate the results of monitoring efforts in addition emc values lump intra event variability neglecting possible ecotoxicology impacts due to peak concentrations also monitoring data in high temporal resolution would be needed to evaluate peak concentrations our analysis is based on eqs values for future work also other approaches could be considered that complement or substitute the eqs approach moreover the risk quotient shows the required dilution factor in the receiving water and not the actual eco toxicological risk 2 there is a clear need for the organization of available and future data according to the fair data principles findable accessible interoperable reusable as outlined in wilkinson et al 2016 and www go fair org fair principles our analysis thoroughly scanned the literature looking for suitable datasets however for some published datasets raw data were not findable and nor accessible e g corresponding authors did not reply to our inquires therefore there are potentially more datasets of interest that could contribute to refining our conclusions not all the datasets included in this study were immediately accessible and they required extensive pre processing before our analysis could be performed moreover we did not report and analyze catchment characteristics due to large differences and subjectivity in the reported land usage which is a challenge for a systematic comparison among sites 3 careful assessment of available resources is essential before undertaking new monitoring campaigns to ensure that collected data are sufficient to draw reliable conclusions given these considerable challenges related to monitoring micropollutants in wet weather flows the involvement of experienced observatories and research teams in monitoring programs is beneficial 4 conclusions our analysis of data from past monitoring efforts covering 77 wet weather discharge sites showed that the collected data has a large number of observations below loq 50 and 40 micropollutants with cases of eqs below loq future monitoring outcomes can be greatly improved with the definition of minimum standards for monitoring wet weather discharges sampling technique number of events and suitable chemical analysis of micropollutants by considering expected concentrations moreover the selection of top listed micropollutants found in higher concentrations e g µg l range will enable a reliable assessment if chemical analysis resources are not sufficient for lower concentration ranges micropollutants from all considered chemical classes heavy metals household industrial pah pesticides pharmaceuticals and personal care products and type of wet weather discharge cso or swo were measured at concentrations above eqs for surface waters hence a thorough monitoring campaign covering different chemical classes and both wet weather discharge types if relevant in the specific catchment would allow to assess environmental impact for receiving waters if resources are limited the total number of monitored micropollutants could be reduced to those identified in the top list after consideration of local regional and national use patterns the number of events and sites needed to draw reliable conclusions depends on the micropollutants concentration variability with more events needed if a micropollutant is expected to show highly variable concentrations for future monitoring campaigns we therefore propose to carefully consider if available resources are sufficient to draw reliable conclusions in case of limited resources an option would be to select indicator micropollutants with high occurrence moreover future data analysis is needed to determine if more sites or more observations per site given a fixed budget produce reliable results for an urban catchment measuring more sites would lead to higher costs due the monitoring equipment needed for each site our analysis highlights the high variability of micropollutant levels in wet weather flows from urban areas larger datasets would enable future analyses such as exploring the factors e g climatic and catchment specific characteristics behind this variability potentially predicting the expected pollution levels and the corresponding environmental impacts in the receiving water bodies collecting sufficient data requires considerable resources which are beyond what single monitoring activities can typically afford hence there is a global need for a minimum standard reporting and for promoting a broader sharing of past and future measurements according to fair principles the data and code used in this work can be accessed on https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 6808401 funding lena mutzner was

15567,urban wet weather discharges from combined sewer overflows cso and stormwater outlets swo are a potential pathway for micropollutants trace contaminants to surface waters posing a threat to the environment and possible water reuse applications despite large efforts to monitor micropollutants in the last decade the gained information is still limited and scattered in a metastudy we performed a data driven analysis of measurements collected at 77 sites 683 events 297 detected micropollutants over the last decade to investigate which micropollutants are most relevant in terms of 1 occurrence and 2 potential risk for the aquatic environment 3 estimate the minimum number of data to be collected in monitoring studies to reliably obtain concentration estimates and 4 provide recommendations for future monitoring campaigns we highlight micropollutants to be prioritized due to their high occurrence and critical concentration levels compared to environmental quality standards these top listed micropollutants include contaminants from all chemical classes pesticides heavy metals polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons personal care products pharmaceuticals and industrial and household chemicals analysis of over 30 000 event mean concentrations shows a large fraction of measurements 50 were below the limit of quantification stressing the need for reliable standard monitoring procedures high variability was observed among events and sites with differences between micropollutant classes the number of events required for a reliable estimate of site mean concentrations error bandwidth of 1 around the true value depends on the individual micropollutant the median minimum number of events is 7 for cso 2 to 31 80 interquantile and 6 for swo 1 to 25

data availability data are shared in a zenodo repository https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 6808401 1 introduction large efforts have been made in the last decade to shed light on the occurrence of micropollutants in wet weather flows from urban areas i e discharges from combined sewer overflows cso and separate stormwater outlets swo these monitoring activities are driven by the increasing awareness of the threat posed by micropollutants also defined as chemicals of emerging concern chemicals of mutual concern priority substances xenobiotics etc to urban and peri urban water bodies musolff et al 2010 schwarzenbach et al 2006 monitoring of micropollutants in wet weather flows has multiple aims i to identify the sources of micropollutants across urban areas linking release processes to e g land use climate and building materials burant et al 2018 gooré bi et al 2015 kafi et al 2008 mutzner et al 2020 rippy et al 2017 wicke et al 2021 ii to assess their threat to the water environment masoner et al 2019 nickel et al 2021 peter et al 2020 petrie 2021 iii to quantify the loads of micropollutants discharged from urban areas at the catchment city river basin scale gasperi et al 2012 launay et al 2016 nickel et al 2021 wittmer et al 2010 zgheib et al 2012 iv to assess the performance of pollution control strategies by e g quantifying the removal performance of stormwater control measures fairbairn et al 2018 sébastian et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 and v to issue discharge permits by local authorities jensen et al 2020 e g miljøstyrelsen 2017 miljøstyrelsen 2013 micropollutant concentrations vary across urban areas gasperi et al 2014 mutzner et al 2020 rippy et al 2017 wicke et al 2021 moreover micropollutants show a high variability over time due to the release and transport processes mainly driven by rainfall gooré bi et al 2015 hence a great number of samples needs to be collected before knowledge of the pollution levels from a specific site is established with confidence bertrand krajewski et al 2002 burton and pitt 2001 mccarthy et al 2018 furthermore uncertainty in sampling and chemical analysis affects the results however the high costs and resource requirements create barriers to extensive data collection these practical limitations are reflected by the fact that single monitoring studies report a relatively small number of data compared to other traditional pollutants such as total suspended solids phosphorus or nitrogen lee et al 2007 mccarthy et al 2018 métadier and bertrand krajewski 2012 studies on micropollutants typically sample between 1 and 12 events based on spahr et al 2020 and table 1 single published datasets analyzed individually do not allow broader conclusions on micropollutant occurrences in urban areas and the planning of optimal monitoring strategies targeting multiple sites there are examples of review studies that collected and compiled measurements from different studies brudler et al 2019 göbel et al 2007 petrie 2021 spahr et al 2020 but little focus has been put into an overarching statistical analysis of the datasets and its implications for future monitoring efforts our study aims to gain new insights from past monitoring and improve the foundation for planning future monitoring campaigns targeting micropollutants in urban wet weather flows our analysis builds upon a data driven analysis of monitoring data collected from multiple sites over the last decade specifically we i investigated the occurrence of micropollutants found in wet weather flows ii assessed the potential risk that they might pose to the water environment and iii analyzed the variability of the collected data both across discharge events and sites to estimate an indicative number of events and sites needed for reliable information on micropollutant concentrations for individual sites as well as several urban catchments finally we summarized these outcomes to iv provide recommendations for designing future monitoring programs that maximize the usefulness of the collected information overall this study will create the basis for a more effective collection of data on micropollutants in wet weather flows enabling more effective management in tackling this environmental challenge 2 materials and methods 2 1 data on micropollutants in urban wet weather flows for our data analysis we considered data from both urban wet weather discharge types combined sewer overflows cso from combined sewer systems and stormwater outlets swo from separate sewer systems we selected only datasets collected after 2010 and those for which we were able to get access to the raw data the data and code are accessible via https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 6808401 we choose only datasets collected with composite sampling meaning the collection of several sub samples per event pooled together into a composite sample and reported as event mean concentration emc the average concentration in a rainfall runoff event the analyzed emc data were collected with time flow or volume proportional sampling table 1 in addition we considered data from passive sampling designed for sampling of wet weather events mutzner et al 2019 pooling data obtained from different sampling strategies limits comparability among studies and thus causes additional uncertainty e g mccarthy and harmel 2014 however given the few available datasets we assume that the advantage of learnings from a collected dataset outweighs the disadvantages our study did not consider datasets with limited data representatively e g grab sampling or unclear sampling strategies the collected data originate from 77 sites 36 cso 41 swo table 1 and include 683 events and 610 total micropollutants while swo data from three continents were europe australia usa the data for cso are only from europe some of the collected datasets also reported other water quality indicators nutrients pathogens which were not included in the scope of this study the r package webchem szöcs et al 2020 was used to find unique cas chemical abstracts service numbers for the micropollutants as different names and cas numbers were used across published studies nevertheless there might be some overlap in the full list of 610 micropollutants the full dataset was then cleaned by considering micropollutants at least found once higher than the limit of quantification loq and by a final manual check leading to 297 micropollutants including heavy metals a total of 34 266 emc observations including those below loq were considered in the analysis fig 1 and si fig a 1 the number of micropollutants found varies considerably among monitored sites and events ranging from 13 to 214 micropollutants and 1 to 35 events per site si fig a 2 2 2 sample preparation and chemical analysis the studies listed in table 1 are based on different sample preparation methods and chemical analyses the detailed chemical analysis and preparation procedures can be found in the original publications table 1 for micropollutant concentrations that were measured as filtered dissolved and not filtered total the total was taken for further calculations heavy metals hydrophobic chemicals for compounds only measured in dissolved not filtered form the dissolved concentration was taken accordingly the environmental quality standard eqs was also considered for the total concentration see details in section 2 4 the differences in sample preparation and chemical analysis can influence the comparison among sites which can falsely suggest a different emission situation due to differences in loq loqs vary among studies and measured micropollutant concentrations range from below ng l to µg l a comparison of loq with eqs shows that for seven out of the nine considered studies loq was higher than eqs for selected micropollutants for 40 micropollutants eqs was smaller than the corresponding loq for selected sites for min 1 max 30 sites si figs a 3 and a 4 in these cases low concentrations close to eqs might not be detected this highlights the challenge faced by existing chemical analysis methodologies in detecting relevant micropollutants in urban wet weather flows 2 3 data pre processing summary statistics including values below the limit of quantification the compiled datasets contain a large number of observations below loq with 51 4 left censored observations see also section 3 1 the data were pre processed to estimate summary statistics taking into account left censored observations loq micropollutants that were not found below detection limit in any samples were considered as not applicable na in the data pre processing when estimating summary statistics when at least 3 emc observations were available and less than 80 of the data were left censored summary statistics were computed for all sites combined as well as for individual sites fig 1 summary statistics were computed by using regression on order statistics ros as detailed in helsel 2011 based on the r package nada lee 2020 first the data were log transformed and then weibull type plotting positions of censored and uncensored observations were calculated linear regression was fitted to the uncensored observations this regression model was then used to estimate the concentration of the observations below loq based on their normal quantiles ros was done for each site and micropollutant separately a visual check of the results confirmed a good fit for the linear regression for most sites with r2 0 5 and a significance of p 0 05 for 85 of all micropollutants per site for each micropollutant and site the ros summary statistics mean was used as site mean concentration smcsite the calculated smcsite is thus the mean of the measured concentrations and it is not weighted with the volume of the event as often done in other studies e g mccarthy et al 2018 the comparison of mean to median per micropollutant and site resulted in an 80 interquantile range of 0 96 to 2 3 confirming that for most micropollutants the data are skewed and a lognormal distribution is more suitable than a normal distribution si fig a 5 overall there were sufficient data for 223 micropollutants 30 659 emc observations which could be used to calculate summary statistics across all sites while for 186 micropollutants site specific summary statistics smcsite were possible fig 1 due to few observations and high censoring no smcsite summary statistics could be computed for 72 of the smcsite observations these measurements were only used to assess the contaminant occurrence at a site section 3 1 without concentration estimates all calculations and graphics were done in r 4 0 3 r core team 2020 using tidyverse incl ggplot2 and nada lee 2020 wickham 2016 wickham et al 2019 2 4 micropollutants occurrences and risk quotients micropollutants were classified into five chemical classes with diverse urban sources ranging from household wastewater to street runoff table 2 we assessed which micropollutants i are often found if searched for per site occurrence and ii are found in concentrations above exiting eqs risk quotient distinguishing between cso and swo we calculated the occurrence by looking at the number of sites where a substance was found at least once loq we then calculated occurrence as the number of detections at least once loq at a site and normalized it by the number of sites where the substance was searched section 2 2 for discussion on loq variability the environmental risk was assessed by calculating a risk quotient rq based on a precautionary 90 percentile of the concentration over all sites estimated from the ros summary statistics divided by chronic eqs for surface freshwaters if no chronic eqs was available acute eqs was used critical concentrations in receiving waters are assumed to potentially occur if rq 1 i e dilution in receiving waters is needed to avoid environmental impacts the use of chronic eqs ensures a more conservative assessment as chronic eqs are lower than acute eqs also even though acute eqs would be more appropriate to judge the risk of a single discharge event their definition definition of event sampling duration etc remains unclear the applied eqs originate from the eu directive annual average eqs the us environmental protection agency us epa and from national water quality standards from denmark and switzerland eu directive 2013 39 2013 miljø 2017 the swiss federal council 1998 us epa 2022 in addition eqs recommended by the swiss ecotox center were used swiss centre ecotox 2021 if more than one eqs value was available the lowest value was taken eqs could be defined for 117 of the 297 micropollutants si table a 2 for micropollutants without eqs no risk quotient was calculated and these micropollutants were not considered for the risk ranking section 3 2 2 5 resampling of measured emc concentrations to estimate the number of events and sites needed 2 5 1 number of events needed for site mean concentration estimate the number of events needed to reliably estimate a site mean concentration smcsite depends on the variability at the specific site i e the inter event variability of measured emcs emcsite bertrand krajewski et al 2002 burton and pitt 2001 mccarthy et al 2018 this variability can be described by the coefficient of variation cvemc site calculated as the standard deviation of emcsite divided by the mean of emcsite i e smcsite fig 2 a differences among coefficient of variations per wet weather discharge type and chemical class were evaluated with one way anova analysis analyzed for homoscedasticity and a tukey s honestly significant difference test for pairwise comparisons was done in r r core team 2020 we evaluated the effect of sampling a limited number of events by drawing subsets of events from the site specific emcsite lognormal distributions for a given micropollutant obtained from the ros summary statistics section 2 3 the following bootstrapping procedure was applied for each micropollutant for the second resampling approach fig 2b 1 a population of 10 000 emcsite values for a given micropollutant and site j was generated from lognormal distributions these lognormal distributed values were calculated with the r package envstats millard 2013 using the mean of emcsite smcsite and the coefficient of variation of emcsite cvemc site from the ros analysis 2 a subset of n random emcsite n values were drawn from the population step 1 without replacement varying the number of drawn events n from 1 to 300 3 for each number of events n subset the smcj n per site j was calculated and then compared to the true smcsite 4 step 2 and 3 were repeated 1 000 times enabling the estimation of the 95 confidence interval of the ratio smcj n smcsite step 3 for different number of events n grey points in fig 2b 5 the error in the smcj n estimation per number of drawn events was calculated by the error bandwidth of the 95 confidence interval of smcj n smcsite red line in fig 2b 6 we identified the number of events needed to estimate smcsite based on an error band width of 0 5 and 1 green arrows in fig 2b 2 5 2 number of sites needed for micropollutants emission estimate among sites urban catchments differ in aspects such as size sewer system topography land use and substance use therefore there is an inherent variability among catchments and wet weather discharge sites which challenges the estimation of micropollutant emissions from wet weather flows at the city river catchment scale where a large number of discharge sites is often present thus an indication of the number of sites needed to account for this inter site variability will help urban water managers to decide on future monitoring programs and allow model based predictions the estimation of a typical smc range of a specific micropollutant in cso and swo requires a minimum number of sites to be monitored for this analysis the coefficient of variation cvsmc was calculated based on the mean smctot and standard deviation of available smcsite values fig 2a data from swo and cso were analyzed separately and micropollutants with less than 3 sites with summary statistics were removed this resulted in a total of 160 smctot 47 cso and 113 swo the exploration of smcsite indicated that the root squared transformation to avoid negative values of smcsite of smcsite per micropollutant follows a normal distribution for the resampling of the sites we followed the following procedure 1 for each micropollutant per swo and cso site a population of 10 000 random normal distributed root squared transformed smcsite was generated 2 a subset of j random smcsite values was drawn from the population without replacement varying the number of drawn sites j from 1 to 200 3 for each j th subset the smctot j value was calculated and then compared to smctot 4 step 2 and 3 were repeated 1 000 times enabling the estimation of the 95 confidence interval of the ratio smctot j smctot step 3 for each site j 5 the error of each j th smctot j estimation was calculated based on the error band width of the 95 confidence interval smctot j smctot 6 we identified the number of sites needed to estimate smctot for an error band width of 0 5 and 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 micropollutants occurrence in cso and swo the percentage of left censored values is higher in swo with 57 censored emc observations than 29 in cso table 3 this difference in censoring could be explained by the larger number of micropollutants searched in swo than in cso about 24 000 and 10 000 observations respectively including micropollutants that are rare in swo e g ppcps chemical classes differ in the number of searched micropollutants pesticides are the largest group of searched pollutants in swo and household industrial in cso the percentage of left censored observations varies from 2 for hm in swo to 83 for ppcps in swo in general there is a clear trend that chemical classes that are expected in wastewater ppcps household industrial have fewer left censored values in cso than in swo hm are almost always found in both system types si fig a 1 some micropollutants were searched in almost all sites cso and swo as shown in fig 3 full list in si b diuron for example was found at 72 sites 34 cso and 41 swo highlighting the importance of cso and swo contributions of this pesticide some micropollutants are predominantly found in cso such as pharmaceuticals from domestic wastewater carbamazepine diclofenac and triclosan nevertheless micropollutants typically associated with domestic wastewater are also found in swo carbamazepine or diclofenac this suggests connections of household wastewater to storm sewers leaky sewer systems or illegal dumping also some pesticides such as mecoprop metolachlor and terbutryn are detected more often in cso than in swo the detection frequency is linked to country and catchment specific use patterns for example terbutryn was searched but never found in swos in australia or fipronil was found only in swo in the united states hence country specific patterns influence the selection of micropollutants for monitoring among the 80 most found micropollutants 26 do not have eqs marked black in fig 3 and no evaluation of the risk quotient was possible section 3 2 on the other hand of the 40 most found micropollutants almost all have eqs available overall 180 micropollutants found at least once loq have no eqs values micropollutants often found can be important to consider for future monitoring and regulators especially when they show a high occurrence list of found searched in si b the results of this graph depend on what has been looked for in the first place for instance cholesterol has only been looked for in swo but most likely it would be present in all cso sites 3 2 top list of micropollutants based on occurrences and risk quotient for many sites micropollutants were detected but in an insufficient number of events to allow the estimation smcsite as among the over 34 000 emc observations 51 4 were left censored moreover in some studies eqs values were below their corresponding loq for 40 micropollutants hitting a maximum of 30 sites with loq eqs for estradiol si fig a 4 comparing occurrence with the risk quotient rq allows to prioritize micropollutants to be considered in future monitoring campaigns and regulations fig 4 31 cso and 31 swo micropollutants showed high occurrence found in over 50 of the sites where they were searched for and a rq bigger than one upper right grass green zone in fig 4 among these top listed micropollutants the top ten micropollutants in cso are from the highest rq cypermethrin ibuprofen benzo a pyrene estradiol copper zinc pyrene fluoranthene estrone pfos in swo the top ten micropollutants are benzo a pyrene fluoranthene pyrene copper zinc mercury benzo b fluoranthene chrysene benzo ghi perylene dibenz ah antracene thus the highest rq are found for metals and pahs with cso sites additionally adding selected pesticides ppcps and household industrial our ranking based on measurements at the discharge point overlaps with studies investigating measured concentrations and environmental risk in receiving waters the analysis of johnson et al 2017 identified copper aluminium zinc ethinylestradiol linearalkylbenzene sulfonate triclosan manganese iron methomyl and chlorpyrifos as the micropollutants posing the highest risk for aquatic organisms in uk rivers although these data are limited to one country the uk not included in our analysis and not necessarily collected during wet weather conditions this confirms that some critical micropollutants e g copper zinc and chloropyrifos have a relevant source in urban wet weather flows our data based ranking also overlaps with a previous assessment based on micropollutants sources and inherent properties the recommendation for swo monitoring by eriksson et al 2007 included metals cadmium chromium copper nickel lead platinium and zinc pahs naphthalene pyrene benzo a pyrene pesticides pendimethalin phenmedipham pentachlorophenol glyphosate and terbuthylazine and household industrial nonylphenol ethoxylates dehp pcb 28 and methyl tert butyl ether this has a high agreement for metals some pahs and household industrial fig 4 however we calculated rq 0 1 for glyphosate and naphthalene phenmedipham pcb 28 and methyl tert butyl ether were not searched for in the analyzed studies while no eqs values were available for pendimethalin found at 46 of swo sites the highlighted micropollutants with rq 1 cover different chemical classes pesticides household industrial pahs heavy metals and ppcps fig 5 showing how various urban sources ranging from household and industrial wastewater to street runoff potentially contribute to environmental impacts based on life cycle analysis a previous study indicated that 97 of the ecotoxicity impacts from swo discharges can be attributed to heavy metals brudler et al 2019 our analysis based on the comparison against eqs confirms that heavy metals are relevant but also that additional micropollutants are relevant when looking at all potential environmental impacts of wet weather flows overall when monitoring csos and swos to assess environmental risks a comprehensive micropollutants list of 31 for cso and swo can be prioritized rq 1 and occurrence 50 fig 4 under consideration of country and site specific contaminant bans or detection of illicit discharges the comparison of micropollutants with rq 1 for cso and swo fig 5 shows that 22 micropollutants are relevant for both systems ppcps are mainly relevant in cso diclofenac ibuprofen estradiol estrone several pesticides have a high rq 1 in swo only carbendazim imidacloprid chlorpyrifos pentachlorophenol however these pesticides also occur in cso and in selected sites concentrations can be higher than eqs while most of the highlighted micropollutants were found at a large number of swo and cso sites fig 3 others such as the pesticides diflufenican and cypermethrin were measured and found only at two cso sites hence increased data collection could confirm the relevance of these micropollutants nevertheless there might be overlooked micropollutants that might be highly relevant but do not have an eqs yet this can be the case for micropollutants with high occurrence shown in fig 3 e g some pfas organophosphates or nicotine or micropollutants that have not yet been reported in stormwater in addition the risk quotient does not take into account transformation products which in some cases could be more toxic than initial compounds therefore if the focus of a monitoring campaign lies in identifying urban sources the above top list can be extended with micropollutants showing high occurrence 3 3 the variability of wet weather flows informs monitoring strategy 3 3 1 variability among events and sites variability among events the measured emcs are highly variable among events with cvemc site 80 interquantile ranging from 0 3 to 1 3 for swo and 0 3 to 1 4 for cso median swo 0 6 median cso 0 7 this variability among events is associated with the inherent variability due to rainfall substance use patterns sources and urban land use gasperi et al 2014 mutzner et al 2020 rippy et al 2017 wicke et al 2021 although our analysis used datasets with experimentally reliable procedures sampling and chemical analysis the influence of data quality on the observed variability cannot be fully excluded our estimates of cvemc for micropollutants are lower than those reported for traditional pollutants cvemc total suspended solids 1 8 conductivity 1 6 cod 1 1 total nitrogen 1 3 in lee et al 2007 in swo also mccarthy et al 2018 found a higher variability with cvemc values of 0 7 to 1 3 for total nitrogen and 1 4 to 2 4 for total suspended solids the higher cvemc for total suspended solids than total nitrogen and micropollutants in our study is an indication that the variability is pollutant specific however more events per site will need to be collected as we cannot exclude that the lower number of monitored events leads to the lower cvemc in our study the variability of cvemc might be different if more events had been monitored however no clear trend between the number of measured events and cvemc was found si fig a 6 and it is thus difficult to estimate what the true cvemc would be a one way anova of cvemc for swo versus cso sites indicates significant differences p 0 003 si a section 2 1 also the median cvemc is slightly higher for cso which could be explained by the mixing of storm and wastewater and the temporal storage of flows adding additional variability hence the minimum number of events to sample for reliable results is slightly different for swo and cso section 3 3 2 the comparison of cvemc with chemical classes shows slight differences for both swo and cso fig 6 a and p 0 001 in one way anova si a section 2 2 in the case of swo a tukey comparison shows that this difference is mainly due to pesticides versus heavy metals and household industrial chemicals heavy metals 0 54 and household industrial 0 59 related micropollutants in swo have lower cvemc than pesticides 0 79 the higher cvemc for pesticides may be related to the local variability in usage sources rainfall and seasonality for pesticides in addition the tukey comparison shows differences between pah and heavy metals for swo which is not the case for cso for cso the differences among cvemc are due to pesticides versus heavy metals household industrial and pahs pesticides in cso have a higher cvemc of 0 80 than other chemical classes with cvemc ranging from 0 62 household industrial 0 66 ppcp pah to heavy metals 0 67 variability among sites sufficient information was available more than two sites with smcsite to calculate smctot for 48 micropollutants for cso and 117 for swo fig 6b the median cvsmc was higher for swo 0 9 than for cso 0 6 si fig a 13 an anova analysis shows a significant difference between cvsmc for cso versus swo p 0 01 si a section 3 1 the larger variability for swo might be explained by the higher variability of storm driven micropollutants due to differences in catchment size land use and substance use while not evaluated as part of this study future research could include these and other watershed characteristics to determine their influence if any on resulting pollutant concentrations the variability among sites is also influenced by systematic differences among sampling strategies and chemical analysis in the studies which could induce additional variability among sites however the variability among sites could in part also be caused by the few events collected for some sites among continents minor differences among cvsmc for swo were found median cvsmc europe 0 69 australia 0 64 united states 0 74 si fig a 18 with no significant differences revealed by an anova analysis the continent specific cvsmc is lower than the overall cvsmc for swo of 0 9 showing that local differences influence cvsmc hence a lower variability can be expected for a catchment or country specific study the comparison of cvsmc highlights distinct differences among chemical classes showing larger variability among sites for certain classes fig 6b the one way anova analysis for swo versus chemical classes p 0 0001 si a section 3 2 shows that pahs have a large influence on the observed differences with a high median cvsmc pahs 1 6 and hm 1 2 a previous study in the us showed that although the range of concentrations can vary commercial parking lots and residential driveways exceed all other source areas often by one or two orders of magnitude selbig 2009 in the case of cso pesticides have a higher median cvsmc 1 05 and the differences in the one way anova analysis p 0 006 are attributed to pesticides versus pahs the observed differences in cvsmc could also be related to the smaller sample size for pesticides and more data would be needed to clarify the observed patterns 3 3 2 how many events should be sampled the resampling results show the dependency between the number of events to be sampled and cvemc fig 7 a with an increasing number of events needed for higher variability in emc as the cvemc depends on the chemical class fig 6 the number of events to be sampled is different depending on the analyzed micropollutant si a section 2 3 based on our resampling procedure a median number of events of 7 results for cso 80 interquantile of 2 to 31 events for all analyzed cvemc fig 7a1 and 6 for swo 80 interquantile of 1 to 25 events for all analyzed cvemc fig 7a1 if the error band width is set to 0 5 the median number of events increases to 28 and 25 for cso and swo respectively fig 7a2 however there is a large variability among the number of required events depending on the analyzed site and thus fig 7 can be used to determine the number of required events based on local conditions and substance selection in comparison mccarthy et al 2018 estimated a higher average number of required events for traditional pollutants in swo of 27 total suspended solids 12 e coli and total nitrogen 11 error band width of 1 a theoretical calculation assuming normally distributed data by burton and pitt 2001 estimated 20 events for a cvemc of 0 4 error band width of 0 5 which is higher than our estimate of a median of 10 events for a cvemc of 0 4 a potential explanation for the lower number of events in our study could be the difference in methodology where we assume that the data are log normal distributed moreover even though the studies considered in our analysis are among the most comprehensive found in literature the number of measured events was lower than the estimated required events for 40 of the smcsite observations si fig a 10 thus our estimation of the number of events to be monitored may be biased moreover our analysis used only data from sites with sufficient data points for statistical inference in case of a large number of censored data points more events would be needed to determine a reliable smcsite 3 3 3 how many sites should be sampled the number of sites required to obtain a reliable estimate of the range of smcsite considering the full dataset used in this study 4 sites for cso 80 interquantile of 2 to 16 and 10 sites for swo 80 interquantile of 3 to 22 for an error band width of 1 around smctot fig 7b1 the number of required sites increases considerably for an error band width of 0 5 around smctot with 18 cso and 41 swo sites si a section 3 3 the differences between cso and swo sites relate to the higher variability of cvsmc among swo sites section 3 3 1 however considering only one continent the median number of required sites is lower due to a lower cvsmc per continent 0 6 to 0 74 than the overall cvsmc of 0 9 moreover the required number of sites depends on the catchment of interest where the number of sites is limited and which is subject to different environmental regulations climatic conditions use patterns and design criteria these results have to be interpreted carefully as 43 of all micropollutants have fewer sites measured than would be necessary according to our analysis for a reliable estimate of smctot si fig a 17 this is especially the case for swo where 66 out of 117 micropollutants 56 have not enough sites monitored in the case of cso this is the case for only 6 micropollutants out of 48 13 in general more sites per micropollutant have been monitored for cso than swo median 12 cso sites and 8 cso sites in conclusion the obtained results for cso seem to be more reliable than for swo and the number of required sites is lower for cso than swo here the importance of monitoring a sufficient number of sites is shown which will enable a model estimate of pollution levels for an urban catchment or river stretch however there are some substance specific considerations micropollutants with high cvsmc require a much larger number of sites with sometimes more sites needed for cso than for swo for instance the estimation of smctot for diuron requires the monitoring of 25 cso and 14 swo sites this also shows how for selected contaminants the number of sites to monitor is significantly higher than our average values reported above these high site numbers may also indicate micropollutants with high variations linked to regional or land use patterns for example wicke et al 2021 highlighted high differences in building based biocides diuron and mecoprop between french and german sites probably due to regional product preferences in these cases the estimation of a minimum number of sites is very challenging based on the currently available data 3 4 discussing the future of monitoring micropollutants in wet weather flows based on the survey of data from the monitoring campaigns that have been published in the last decade and their outcomes we identified several learnings for future monitoring campaigns and regulations of wet weather flows which substances should we measure and regulate 1 our data driven analysis highlights micropollutants with high occurrence and risk quotient to focus on in regulatory and research monitoring campaigns thus ensuring that efforts and resources are maximized clearly this general list will need to be adapted to the local conditions as the prioritization could be affected by site specific factors such as industrial production and land usage use habits and country specific regulations the analyzed data are based on a selected developed countries and the transferability of the results to other countries depends on local product preferences and use patterns also the top listed micropollutants are subject to change over time as new products are brought to the market while others are substituted or banned this is especially relevant for micropollutants used in household products and found in domestic wastewater where product composition and usage pattern can change over time for mainly stormwater based micropollutants the evolution over time is buffered as building materials or vehicles create a stock of micropollutants 2 selected non target screening for future stormwater quality monitoring is needed to update the top list with new micropollutants of emerging concern such as the tire rubber chemical 6 ppd quinone tian et al 2021 moreover access to consumer data and communication with product regulators could lead to targeted monitoring of micropollutants of potential concern 3 micropollutants are often grouped into chemical classes however the top lists from our study show the occurrence of micropollutants belonging to different groups this suggests that monitoring efforts should target different classes as one class does not cover the whole toxicity spectrum and or the diversity of urban sources also to reduce the resource requirements it is beneficial to identify indicator micropollutants i e proxies of other substances that are representative of specific sources transport mechanisms environmental behavior and or land usages to reduce analytical efforts in case of limited resources launay et al 2016 mutzner et al 2020 although this was not performed in this study the collected data can provide the information basis for such future analysis how much should we measure 1 micropollutants at concentrations of potential risk for aquatic organisms are found in both cso and swo thus the assessment of surface water status requires the consideration of both wet weather fluxes 2 the analysis indicates the number of events for wet weather flow monitoring of cso 2 to 31 for events 80 interquantile range median 7 and swo 1 to 25 events for 80 interquantile range median 6 that need to be monitored to draw reliable conclusions error band width of 1 for smcsite for selected chemical classes pesticides for cso and swo pahs for swo or expected high variability cvemc the number of events needs to be chosen higher moreover also for individual micropollutants the number of events can differ considerably from the estimated median number of events si fig a 11 and fig 7 can be used to estimate the number of events 3 the observed high number of censored values in the collected data 50 stresses the importance to redesign future wet weather monitoring programs by improving current sample preparation and chemical analysis this is highlighted by a considerable number of micropollutants 40 of 117 where eqs was smaller than loq in some studies 4 reliable sampling and chemical analysis are essential for robust statistical inference for example the variability among events estimated in our work expressed as cvemc was lower than previously reported for traditional pollutants lee et al 2007 mccarthy et al 2018 while there is some indication that the variability is pollutant specific we do not know if the lower variability in our study is also related to the small number of events monitored at some sites 5 most urban catchments and surface waters have a large number of wet weather discharge sites thus we need to know how many sites would need to be monitored to allow a model prediction for all discharge sites based on our full dataset covering different countries our analysis indicates that a minimum of 4 cso 80 interquantile of 2 to 16 and 10 swo 80 interquantile of 3 to 22 sites need to be monitored to estimate a typical range of smctot an error band width of 1 however the required number of sites depends on the catchment of interest for which typically the number of sites is limited and local conditions regarding environmental regulations climatic conditions use patterns and design criteria are more constant hence the required minimum number of sites gives the first indication if there is a lack of local monitoring data generally a monitoring program has to be planned carefully to cover a diversity of typical land use types especially for chemical classes with high variability among sites pah heavy metals pesticides 6 the concept of smc implies the hypothesis of stationarity of the pollutant release processes throughout the monitoring period however pollutant sources in the catchment can change due to e g changes in the human activities industries in the catchment banning of specific substances etc this stresses the importance of adapting the monitoring program to the knowledge of the pollutant sources in the catchment what else do we need to take into account 1 in our risk evaluation we compared event mean concentrations emc with eqs for surface waters however most eqs values are not designed for short term minutes to hours wet weather flows and not all micropollutants with high occurrence have eqs values therefore new risk assessment tools specifically targeting wet weather flows are needed to evaluate the results of monitoring efforts in addition emc values lump intra event variability neglecting possible ecotoxicology impacts due to peak concentrations also monitoring data in high temporal resolution would be needed to evaluate peak concentrations our analysis is based on eqs values for future work also other approaches could be considered that complement or substitute the eqs approach moreover the risk quotient shows the required dilution factor in the receiving water and not the actual eco toxicological risk 2 there is a clear need for the organization of available and future data according to the fair data principles findable accessible interoperable reusable as outlined in wilkinson et al 2016 and www go fair org fair principles our analysis thoroughly scanned the literature looking for suitable datasets however for some published datasets raw data were not findable and nor accessible e g corresponding authors did not reply to our inquires therefore there are potentially more datasets of interest that could contribute to refining our conclusions not all the datasets included in this study were immediately accessible and they required extensive pre processing before our analysis could be performed moreover we did not report and analyze catchment characteristics due to large differences and subjectivity in the reported land usage which is a challenge for a systematic comparison among sites 3 careful assessment of available resources is essential before undertaking new monitoring campaigns to ensure that collected data are sufficient to draw reliable conclusions given these considerable challenges related to monitoring micropollutants in wet weather flows the involvement of experienced observatories and research teams in monitoring programs is beneficial 4 conclusions our analysis of data from past monitoring efforts covering 77 wet weather discharge sites showed that the collected data has a large number of observations below loq 50 and 40 micropollutants with cases of eqs below loq future monitoring outcomes can be greatly improved with the definition of minimum standards for monitoring wet weather discharges sampling technique number of events and suitable chemical analysis of micropollutants by considering expected concentrations moreover the selection of top listed micropollutants found in higher concentrations e g µg l range will enable a reliable assessment if chemical analysis resources are not sufficient for lower concentration ranges micropollutants from all considered chemical classes heavy metals household industrial pah pesticides pharmaceuticals and personal care products and type of wet weather discharge cso or swo were measured at concentrations above eqs for surface waters hence a thorough monitoring campaign covering different chemical classes and both wet weather discharge types if relevant in the specific catchment would allow to assess environmental impact for receiving waters if resources are limited the total number of monitored micropollutants could be reduced to those identified in the top list after consideration of local regional and national use patterns the number of events and sites needed to draw reliable conclusions depends on the micropollutants concentration variability with more events needed if a micropollutant is expected to show highly variable concentrations for future monitoring campaigns we therefore propose to carefully consider if available resources are sufficient to draw reliable conclusions in case of limited resources an option would be to select indicator micropollutants with high occurrence moreover future data analysis is needed to determine if more sites or more observations per site given a fixed budget produce reliable results for an urban catchment measuring more sites would lead to higher costs due the monitoring equipment needed for each site our analysis highlights the high variability of micropollutant levels in wet weather flows from urban areas larger datasets would enable future analyses such as exploring the factors e g climatic and catchment specific characteristics behind this variability potentially predicting the expected pollution levels and the corresponding environmental impacts in the receiving water bodies collecting sufficient data requires considerable resources which are beyond what single monitoring activities can typically afford hence there is a global need for a minimum standard reporting and for promoting a broader sharing of past and future measurements according to fair principles the data and code used in this work can be accessed on https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 6808401 funding lena mutzner was

15568,we propose and demonstrate a new approach for fast and accurate surrogate modelling of urban drainage system hydraulics based on physics guided machine learning the surrogates are trained against a limited set of simulation results from a hydrodynamic hifi model our approach reduces simulation times by one to two orders of magnitude compared to a hifi model it is thus slower than e g conceptual hydrological models but it enables simulations of water levels flows and surcharges in all nodes and links of a drainage network and thus largely preserves the level of detail provided by hifi models comparing time series simulated by the surrogate and the hifi model r2 values in the order of 0 9 are achieved surrogate training times are currently in the order of one hour however they can likely be reduced through the application of transfer learning and graph neural networks our surrogate approach will be useful for interactive workshops in initial design phases of urban drainage systems as well as for real time applications in addition our model formulation is generic and future research should investigate its application for simulating other water systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydrodynamic simulation scientific machine learning surrogate model urban drainage data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction computational modelling is essential in all phases of managing urban drainage systems uds from design to monitoring and control physics based deterministic models are widely used around the world these models solve saint venant s system of equations in small time steps for each pipe element abbott and ionescu 1967 we will refer to this approach as high fidelity models high fidelity hifi models are directly linked to physical system characteristics such as pipe diameter and length and both water levels and flows are simulated in a realistic manner which makes them attractive to practitioners however high simulation times limit stakeholder involvement in the design phase leskens et al 2014 as well as the exploration of impacts of deep uncertainties about future climates and urban developments löwe et al 2020 in addition real time applications such as warning and control usually require shorter simulation times than what is feasible with hifi models to circumvent these problems hydrologists have developed a number of so called lower fidelity surrogates razavi et al 2012 in particular a variety of conceptual or lumped hydrological models were developed for uds burger et al 2016 kroll et al 2017 moreno rodenas et al 2018 thrysøe et al 2019 all these approaches reduce computation times by orders of magnitude however they achieve speedup at the cost of simplifying the simulated processes or lowering the spatiotemporal resolution typically only flows are simulated not water levels and only few selected locations in the pipe network are considered the practical consequences are that the existing surrogates are valid only for a limited range of purposes e g sewer overflow but not flood risk are not straightforward to set up automatically from pipe databases and extrapolate poorly to a changing drainage system structure this limitation is not present for cellular automata approaches that only simplify the mathematical description of the processes but preserve the level of detail of the model austin et al 2014 however similarly small simulation time steps as with a numerical simulator must be selected limited speed ups in the order of factor 5 where therefore achieved machine learning approaches have gained traction in hydrology they are frequently applied in an input output setting including settings where physical system characteristics are used as inputs the resulting models can be transferable between catchments as demonstrated for example for rainfall runoff modelling kratzert et al 2019 and flood predictions bentivoglio et al 2022 löwe et al 2021 efforts have also been made to ensure conservation of mass frame et al 2022 both in rainfall runoff modelling and in hydraulics data driven approaches have also been integrated into numerical solvers with the aim of either simplifying numerical process equations uncovering unknown relationships or achieving better model fits techniques such as genetic programming danandeh mehr et al 2018 neural networks höge et al 2022 and curve fitting jamali et al 2021 were used while this approach can yield better fit with data and preserves physical interpretability it is subject to similar limitations as the cellular automata approach in terms of computational performance for example jamali et al 2021 achieved very limited reductions in simulation time for a problem involving solutions of the 2d shallow water equations in summary there is a gap for surrogate approaches that simulate the full hydraulics for the often many thousand states included in a hifi model while still achieving substantial reductions in simulation time in this paper we argue that scientific or physics informed machine learning karniadakis et al 2021 willard et al 2020 is an avenue worth investigating and we develop a proof of concept for this purpose other than purely data driven methods scientific machine learning seeks to integrate machine learning and established methods from scientific computing and statistics in order to utilize domain knowledge and known physical information in the learning process baker et al 2019 there is a rapid development of scientific machine learning methods that model differential and partial differential equation systems using both time discrete chen and xiu 2021 geneva and zabaras 2020 and time continuous approaches raissi et al 2019 wang et al 2021 these are partly based on earlier ideas hunt et al 1992 lagaris et al 1998 but embrace new contexts with technologies that were not available before the computational efficiency of neural networks enables models with large numbers of state variables this ability is relevant for uds where we often want to simulate water levels and flows in hundreds or thousands of links and nodes further scientific machine learning models learn interrelations between multiple states e g water levels in neighboring nodes and approaches that enable the exploitation of time series trends to increase simulation accuracy exist geneva and zabaras 2020 ren et al 2022 for hydraulics these properties may enable the consideration of larger simulation time steps than presented in the literature so far finally scientific machine learning enables multiple ways to incorporate physical system understanding into a data driven model e g in the form of physics guided model architectures mathematical constraints that enforce physical behavior or physics informed loss functions lu et al 2021 wang et al 2021 willard et al 2020 for this paper our ambition is to 1 develop a proof of concept for simulating the hydraulics of uds using scientific machine learning to our knowledge this has not been attempted before it enables fast surrogates that distinguish themselves from existing lumped approaches through high spatial detail and by considering flows levels and surcharges 2 specifically we build on generalized residue networks chen and xiu 2021 as suggested by garzón et al 2022 we incorporate inductive bias by designing a model architecture that is aligned with physical intuition about the hydraulic behavior of the pipe system 3 illustrate potentials as well as current bottlenecks and pitfalls when applying these techniques in a realistic setting with time varying rainfall inputs and complex pipe flow dynamics 4 draw up further research directions based on current developments in the literature 2 material and methods 2 1 principal concepts our aim is to construct a fast surrogate model for 1d hydrodynamics in pipes that enables the simulation of both water levels and flows in all nodes and links of an uds much like existing hifi models hifi models for uds s typically simulate catchment runoff independently subsequently it is routed through the nodes into the drainage network where hydraulics are simulated by numerically solving the saint venant equations the runoff simulation typically has marginal computational cost while the network simulation is computationally expensive thus we propose a surrogate model of the drainage network hydraulics only the hydraulic states of interest for each node in the drainage network are the water level in the node h the flow in upstream and downstream links q as well as excess flows q w for which we later will distinguish between frequently activated overflows q w o v e r f l o w and infrequently activated surcharges that cause pluvial flooding q w s u r c h a r g e fig 1 a because we focus only on the network component the surrogate model is given the runoff r as input and only predicts h q and q w fig 1b moreover the model is structured autoregressively the model predicts how the hydraulic states change from one time step to another given a vector of runoff inputs during this time step the predicted states are then used as the starting point for the next time step thus the model learns how the hydraulic states change over a time interval δ t considering surface runoff as a boundary condition once initialized the surrogate can independently simulate time periods of any duration given a series of runoff inputs similar autoregressive approaches were proposed earlier hunt et al 1992 but have not been adapted for hydrodynamics we will consider a surrogate time step δ t of 1 min which is well above the stability criteria for the hifi model the surrogate is trained against a limited set of simulation results from a hifi model so called labeled data 2 2 model formulation we start by introducing the concept of generalized residue networks then we provide a model formulation for urban drainage systems and finally we introduce physical system understanding into this model 2 2 1 generalized residue networks gresnet consider a dynamical system posed as an initial value problem with state vector x that changes over time t 1 d x d t f x t t o x t o x o we define the flow map as a real valued function that maps how the state vector of the system changes from time t to t δ t qin et al 2019 suggested that this flow map can be approximated by the function 2 x t δ t x t n x t θ where n is a deep feed forward neural network with parameters θ the principal idea of this approach is that the solution of the differential equation system in eq 1 is approximated by an euler scheme in discrete time steps δ t using an identity mapping of the model states and a deep neural network that learns the residue from data thereby capturing the system dynamics without knowing the true f x a priori initializing from some starting states x o eq 2 can be used to simulate the system forward in time chen and xiu 2021 extended the approach by replacing the identity mapping in eq 2 with a flexible operator mapping x t δ t l x t that facilitates training of the model l can in principle be any model approximation for the system when l is unknown they suggest that dynamic mode decomposition schmid 2010 is a good guess which in turn resembles a feed forward neural network l with a single hidden layer this leads to the formulation of generalized residue networks gresnet where l is a neural network with a single hidden layer 3 x t δ t l x t θ l n x t θ n 2 2 2 generalized residue networks for uds the model formulation in eq 3 is attractive for the simulation of urban drainage networks because it allows for the consideration of a large number of states in the vector x because we can consider various formulations of the neural network n that reflect different system complexities and because we can impose physical constraints on model predictions that will be introduced in the next section assuming that we want to use eq 3 to simulate an uds with n nodes and m links we consider a state vector that includes the water levels h in all nodes the flows q through all links and the excess flows q w from all nodes fig 1a 4 x t h 1 h n q 1 q m q w 1 q w n the state changes from one time step to another depending on the boundary conditions imposed on the system i e the vector of runoff volumes r t r 1 r n that enter the nodes in the considered time interval we therefore consider r t as an additional input to the deep neural network n while we preserve the purely state dependent formulation of the prior model l 5 x t δ t l x t θ l n x t r t θ n starting from some initial state values x 0 this model simulates water levels pipe flows and surcharge flows in time intervals δ t for each node and each link for which the model is trained 2 2 3 physics constrained generalized residue networks for uds predictions from the model in eq 5 are in no way constrained to a range that is physically reasonable beucler et al 2021 suggested in a similar setting that one way of ensuring physically appropriate behavior of the model is to introduce so called constraint layers c these can be interpreted as a post processing step after each prediction and calculate certain model states based on a physical understanding of the system 6 x t δ t c l x t θ l n x t r t θ n an import learning from initial experiments with eq 5 was that surcharge flows q w s u r c h a r g e were difficult to learn for a purely data driven model however surcharge flows occur only when the water level in a node reaches the ground level and the connected pipes exceed their capacity in this situation the water volume stored in the pipe network remains constant and q w s u r c h a r g e can be computed from a mass balance calculation that is performed locally for each node therefore we suggest a revised model formulation where the state vector eq 4 is reduced to only include water levels and pipe flows 7 x t h 1 h n q 1 q m surcharges are subsequently calculated in a constraint layer as the difference between all the inflows to a node i from upstream pipe elements considering the link flow values predicted by the gresnet and runoff and the outflow to all downstream pipe elements in addition we enforce a minimum of 0 for surcharge flows because we perform hifi simulations in spilling configuration i e surcharging water does not reenter the drainage system this configuration was shown to yield more realistic representations of pressure levels in intense rain storms than the widely used ponding configuration jamali et al 2018 8 q w i max j q u s i j k q d s i k r i 0 note that while we have removed q w from the state vector we still consider all states h q and q w when computing the deviation between hifi model and surrogate during training section 0 thus the mass balance computation affects the parameter estimates of the gresnet 2 3 surrogate training the proposed model includes parameter sets θ l and θ n that need to be estimated for this purpose we simulate rainfall series of limited duration in a hifi model and extract time series of the simulated hydraulic states for all nodes and links in 1 min resolution the surrogate parameters are estimated by minimizing the mean squared error mse between the labels generated by the hifi model and the corresponding hydraulic states simulated by the surrogate when computing mse all three state variables h q and q w are considered for all nodes and links irrespective of the model version all states are scaled to the range 0 1 before computing mse to ensure that all state variables have approximately equal impact on the parameter estimates scaling is performed using a min max approach pedregosa et al 2011 and the scaling range is defined individually for each state variable based on the minimum and maximum values observed in the hifi simulations as illustrated in fig 1c surrogate development is divided into training validation and testing steps to enable faster processing the training series is divided into chunks windows that can be simulated in parallel the surrogate is initialized from the hifi results at the beginning of a window and then independently simulates the hydraulic states for a number of time steps corresponding to the so called window size a window size of one time step maximizes the potential for parallel processing and will thus yield the fastest training however it also entails a high risk of overfitting because the surrogate is initialized from the true values at each time step and thus never forced to generate stable simulations in the training phase the window approach implies that the surrogate is trained considering a variety of starting values for the states in the validation and testing steps surrogate simulations are initialized from an empty pipe system 2 4 technical implementation surrogate models were implemented in python 3 8 using google s tensorflow library version 2 7 0 abadi et al 2016 parameter estimation was performed over 2 000 epochs or optimizer iterations using the adam algorithm kingma and ba 2014 the learning rate is a key parameter that affects how aggressively the optimizer changes parameters it was by trial and error configured with a starting value of 1e 3 which exponentially decayed to 1e 4 to avoid divergence in the end of the training you et al 2019 we stopped training preliminarily if the validation mse did not decrease for 500 epochs in a row relu activation functions were used in the hidden layers of the neural networks based on initial experiments and because they are the current standard for deep neural networks goodfellow et al 2016 2 5 design of experiments 2 5 1 catchment and hifi model we considered two medium sized test systems extracted from a real uds in bochum germany fig 2 system 1 includes 60 pipes and a catchment area of 14 ha while system 2 includes 87 links and a catchment area of 26 ha except for the outlets all nodes are equipped with a spilling weir placed near ground level to simulate water discharged to the surface system 1 includes an overflow at node 27793 with a weir crest just above the top of the pipe level this overflow occurs more frequent than spills which may affect surrogate training system 2 includes a basin with a volume of 140 m3 close to the outlet the basin outflow is throttled to a maximum of 0 6 m3 s and the connected overflow weir crest is placed 3 m above invert level the basin thus creates backwater in the surrounding pipe stretches we used system 1 to develop the proposed surrogate configuration while system 2 was used to validate the approach in a more challenging system with looped network connections and fast backwater dynamics detailed system properties are provided in the supporting information 2 5 2 training validation and testing data we generated training validation and testing data for the development of surrogates by performing hydrodynamic simulations with the mike 1d engine dhi 2021 for surrogate training and validation we performed hydrodynamic simulations using two different sets of rainfall series as input a we considered 40 years of rainfall observations in 1 min resolution from a gauge in odense that is part of the danish svk network we identified rain events see supporting information and manually selected 154 rain events for training and 43 rain events for validation we aimed to include events with different temporal variations and intensities the selected events were concatenated into one series resulting in a training series consisting of 73 990 one minute data points and a validation series of 19 095 data points b we aimed to create a rainfall series where extreme events were overrepresented to facilitate surrogate training for these situations we repeated the above process considering 10 rain gauges from various locations in denmark each with 40 years of rainfall observations we manually selected 203 events for training and 58 events for validation from the pool of events we considered all rainstorms where flooding would be likely to occur and generally focused our selection on intense rainstorms the events were again concatenated into one series resulting in a training series of 74 769 time steps and a validation series of 21 700 time steps all surrogates were tested by performing simulations for a rainfall series consisting of 40 years of continuous observations in næstved denmark 8200 events this series was not considered in the creation of datasets a or b the gauge is located approximately 30 km away from the nearest gauge considered in the creation of dataset b and was intended as a fully independent test series 2 5 3 summary of experiments the technical implementation of our surrogates has two main hyperparameters these are the window size used for subdividing the training data series see section 2 3 as well as the complexity of the neural network n that is used to model the residue of the linear predictor l see eq 5 to identify a reasonable configuration we compared m s e obtained on the validation dataset so called validation loss and training times for the hyperparameter configurations shown in table 1 this process was repeated five times for each combination of hyper parameters because different random initializations of the parameters in the neural networks lead to slightly different validation losses subsequently we selected the configuration with the best compromise between validation loss and computational efficiency and compared surrogate configurations with and without physical constraints that were trained on datasets a or b finally the preferred configuration was tested on system 2 2 6 scoring criteria to compare the surrogate simulations against hifi simulations we considered widely used scoring criteria that were computed for the testing series we considered rmse and r2 to measure both average and event based performance of the surrogates all scores were computed in the untransformed space i e the units of rmse are meter for water levels and m3 s for flows we evaluated the total excess flow volume t q w i t for individual nodes during individual rain events to assess whether overflows and surcharges were predicted in the correct locations and with accurate magnitude finally to evaluate whether the model results are biased we compared total runoff surcharge overflow and outflow volumes 3 results 3 1 hyperparameter selection fig 3 illustrates the validation loss smallest validation m s e obtained during training for different combinations of neural network configuration and window size considering surrogates that included physical constraints for surcharges and that were trained on series a the results for this surrogate configuration illustrate the considerations arising during training results for other surrogate configurations are included in the supporting information smaller window sizes allow faster training of the surrogates when parallel processing is exploited but increase the risk of overfitting this issue is very clear from the figure where models trained with window sizes of 1 and in some cases 10 min yield substantially larger validation losses surrogates with too few parameters lead to unstable validation results because they have difficulties learning the dynamics of the system considering also the results obtained for data series b supporting information network sizes s3 and s4 are preferable moving from neural network size s1 to s4 computation times per epoch on a single cpu increased moderately in the order of 30 considering the more stable convergence properties of the more complex models we moved forward with network size s4 and a window size of 60 min for the remaining study experiments with more complex neural networks did not yield better convergence in the tested sewer systems supporting information 3 2 effects of training series and physical constraints on event based performance fig 4 shows rmse computed for h q q w o v e r f l o w and q w s u r c h a r g e for individual rain events in system 1 the presented results were generated from surrogates trained on data series b amongst the 5 training iterations for each model fig 3 we show results for the best performing model without physical constraints lowest validation loss and the worst performing model with physical constraints highest validation loss we used the peak flow simulated by the hifi model at the outlet to distinguish low and high flow conditions in the figure a general increase of rmse can be observed for high flow conditions this may be linked to a change of dynamics in extreme flow situations and the relatively fewer occurrences of such situations even in data series b nevertheless rmse values for levels and flows are in the range of few cm and few l s respectively this suggests that the surrogates generally achieve high accuracy rmse values for water levels and flows are slightly higher for the model considering physical constraints in this model configuration the simulated water levels are tied to the activation of mass balance computations for excess flows thus the surrogate has less freedom to fit the water level data than the model without constraints in contrast the model including physical constraints achieves much lower rmse values for q w o v e r f l o w and q w s u r c h a r g e panels c and d deviations in low flow conditions where the hifi model does not simulate excess flow are entirely removed in addition smaller rmse values are also achieved in periods where excess flows occur fig 5 analyses the behavior of predicted overflows and surcharges in system 1 more in depth the figure compares total overflow and surcharge volumes for individual rain events in the testing dataset considering each node individually panels a and c consider surrogates trained on data series a while panels b and c consider surrogates trained on data series b comparing the two surrogate configurations we can conclude that the introduction of physical constraints leads to a much better representation of excess flows however comparing panels a and c against panels b and d a clear effect of the training series is also noticeable when trained on series a predictions of overflow and surcharge volumes are slightly more uncertain because these events are too sparse in the training data the predicted water levels and link flows are then not properly tuned to enable an accurate mass balance calculation considering training series b especially the errors for surcharges are much reduced because these situations now occur sufficiently often during training to enable the surrogate to learn the corresponding dynamics 3 3 time averaged test scores fig 6 shows score values for the different hydraulic states as well as total water volumes that enter and leave the models we compare the score values obtained for different surrogate configurations in system 1 stage 2 in addition we compare the performance of the surrogate configuration that was trained on series b and includes physical constraints between systems 1 and 2 as already indicated by the previous results imposing physical constraints led to improved simulations of surcharges and overflows which is indicated by improved rmse values panel a much improved r2 values panel b and reduced volume errors panel c comparing the two model configurations with physical constraints the performance of the surrogates trained on different data series was very similar however surrogates trained on series b yielded slightly lower rmse values and slightly higher r2 values similar average score values where obtained for systems 1 and 2 with the exception of higher average rmse scores that can be associated with larger flows in this system 3 4 surrogate performance in specific elements fig 7 illustrates for the surrogate with physical constraints how the accuracy of simulated water levels and link flows varies in space figs 8 and 9 show time series plots for the elements highlighted in fig 7 in the time series plots we again consider the worst performing surrogate across 5 training iterations figs 7 and 8 generally suggest strong performance in system 1 the hydrographs clarify that surrogates without physical constraints create false predictions of excess flows q w with both positive and negative signs these issues are more pronounced for surcharges panel d than for overflows panel c the latter occur more frequently in the dataset and are thus easier to learn for the surrogate the issue is avoided when introducing physical constraints for surcharge predictions into the surrogate a limitation becomes clear from lower r2 in some upstream links and nodes in the center of the catchment in this area the connected sub catchments have very low imperviousness ratios resulting in small infrequent pipe flows the surrogate can then not learn the relationship between inflow and hydraulics this issue can be avoided by ensuring that training data are generated in such a way that high and low inflow situations occur in all parts of the system for system 2 figs 7 and 9 similar illustrate strong surrogate performance except for locations where fast flow reversals occur in these locations the surrogate is only partly able to simulate the flow reversal and quite similar to the surcharge results without physical constraints creates false predictions of small flows with both positive and negative signs in low flow conditions that lead to very low r2 values note that these issues do not affect surrogate performance in the remaining system 3 5 computation time table 2 compares computational effort for training and running the surrogates against the time required to simulate the testing series in the hifi model the surrogates are currently trained against results from a hifi simulations therefore we also included the time required to perform these simulations for the training and validation dataset label generation tests were performed on an hp zbook g9 with intel core i9 10885h processor and 32gb ram all tests were performed using a single cpu only training times ranged between 0 5 and 2 h surrogates trained on data series a generally converged faster which may be related to the less complicated dynamics in this series surrogates including physical constraints were in the order of 10 faster than surrogates without physical constraints because the surrogates included 33 fewer state variables excess flows q w were instead computed efficiently in a postprocessing step prediction times for the testing series 8 200 rain events were in the order of 100 s and thus in a range that enables real time applications as well as interactive simulations in workshop settings for hifi simulations we considered a fixed simulation time step of 5 s note that the simulation time step of a hifi model can both be lower or higher depending on the hydraulic conditions in the specific system and if adaptive time stepping schemes dhi 2021 are employed surrogate simulation times will remain constant as long as the same simulation time step here one minute is considered however prediction accuracy may be reduced in some situations while we tested computation times in a single cpu setting the surrogates can exploit parallel computing which is important for implementation we did not achieve reduced simulation times by employing gpus this is most likely due to the autoregressive character of the models which implies that the technical implementation includes a loop over a time series the higher processing speed of cpus then outperforms the parallelization capacities of gpus 4 discussion 4 1 results and limitations the results shown in the previous section illustrate that our surrogate modelling approach can simulate water levels flows overflows and surcharges much alike a state of the art hydrodynamic model the surrogates enable long time series simulations in our case 8 200 rain events extracted from 40 years of rainfall observations of water levels flows and surcharges in all nodes and pipes of a drainage system within few minutes while these results are promising our work has several clear limitations that will need to be addressed in further research to make the approach applicable in practice 1 our test cases are examples of typical drainage networks including overflows and surcharges loops and backwater situations but all pipes are circular and no controlled structures are included the results suggest that the current surrogate configuration can only to a limited extent simulate fast flow reversal dynamics this issue does however not propagate to other parts of the system because the surrogate simplistically speaking simulates hydraulics based on correlations between inputs and states rather than iteratively our current surrogate formulation may have difficulties to learn the dynamics in systems with very irregular cross sections e g when simulating open water bodies or trunk sewers that can be dominated by inflows in few selected points potential improvements are outlined in section 4 3 but there will be hydraulic situations that a surrogate cannot fully simulate these limitations need not impair its applicability for assessing for example surcharge frequencies in practice we can support the user by highlighting the accuracy of simulations for the validation series in all links and nodes 2 one avenue for upscaling our approach to large drainage systems is to subdivide the drainage network into many small subsections each of which is simulated by an independent sub model see section 4 2 implementing such an approach requires that sub models can be trained independently from each other and subsequently generate accurate simulations for the combined systems we have not documented such approaches 3 we have not considered the effect of controlled actuators such as pumps or moveable weirs in many cases the water level in a controlled actuator can be derived using simple mass balance calculations that consider storage volume and the controlled outflow balla et al 2022 similar to the previous point the main challenge is then to develop dedicated training approaches such that the surrogate learns to simulate the system dynamics given one or more water level boundaries 4 we created artificial rainfall series for training the surrogates these were defined based on hydrological intuition with the aim of representing the range of relevant dynamics we have not investigated how many data points should be included in the training series structured approaches for selecting the rain events included in the training data e g allen et al 2022 may enable surrogate training with shorter series and reduced training times 5 fig 8 suggests a clear dependency between the complexity of the neural network included in the surrogate model and the accuracy of the simulations in general we would expect that an increase of the number of state variables in the model requires that more complex neural networks with more parameters are needed in the surrogate to achieve sufficient accuracy the form of this relationship is currently unknown further better convergence properties may be obtained with alternative network architectures that for example employ separate neural networks for water levels and flows or replicate more advanced numerical solution schemes than the euler scheme used in our work wang and lin 1998 6 all simulations in our study considered a uniform distribution of rainfall in space for our test cases this assumption is quite realistic however surrogate developments for larger drainage systems will need to consider spatial rainfall variations 7 while pipe flow simulations are performed with high accuracy we are not currently enforcing mass balance in the model architecture 8 surrogate accuracy was compared solely against hifi simulations while the hifi model does not necessarily reflect reality pedersen et al 2022 4 2 upscaling to large drainage networks in its current configuration our surrogate approach enables assessments of how changes in urban runoff affect sewer overflows surcharge frequencies and wastewater treatment plant inflow within a few minutes and thus sufficiently fast however any modifications of the hydraulic behavior of the pipe system will require retraining of the surrogate models in workshop settings it is infeasible to perform retraining of surrogates for large drainage networks with many thousand links however if the model is divided into subsystems then only smaller submodels where changes are made will need to be retrained this approach raises issues in ensuring that multiple submodels interact in a stable and hydraulically appropriate manner however it is common practice to identify hydraulically simple locations for subdividing urban drainage networks when setting up conceptual models kroll et al 2017 and the process can be automated johansen and skindhøj 2022 another option would be to use conceptual models to simulate the main flows in the sewer network and then to use these simulations as inflow boundary to the hydraulic surrogates presented in our study this approach would yield guaranteed mass conservative simulations while extending conceptual models with hydraulic detail that is not available today it would also offer a straight forward setting for implementing controlled actuators as part of the conceptual model 4 3 research perspectives we anticipate that future research can much improve our surrogate approach by reducing training times and incorporating additional physical constraints into the model architecture in terms of reduced training efforts graph neural networks zhou et al 2020 enable the creation of surrogates where new states for a node or pipe are predicted based on the current state of its neighbors while the approach presented in our paper considers all states in the drainage network as input to a single neural network graph approaches would process each node and link individually when combined with physical system properties such as pipe lengths and slopes the resulting surrogates may become transferable across catchments the approach may also improve simulations of flow reversal because the hydraulics in each node and link would be predicted depending on the current state of the neighboring nodes and links physics informed loss functions raissi et al 2019 wang et al 2021 could enable surrogate training without generating training data in a hydrodynamic model first while training times would increase it may be attractive from a practical viewpoint to avoid data management and stability issues associated with automated handling of a numerical engine in addition physics informed loss functions may enable bypassing numerical simplifications that are commonly implemented in commercial software packages for drainage system simulation because the surrogate can be trained directly against the pde system finally transfer learning jin et al 2021 i e initializing the surrogate parameters based on experience from previous training iterations is likely to enable surrogate training in much fewer epochs than documented in our paper we have far from exploited all opportunities for implementing physical knowledge into the surrogates for example flow formulas were used in the development of cellular automate for drainage networks austin et al 2014 and could be incorporated into the l term in eq 3 to generate robust flow predictions another relevant consideration would be to compute volume changes in each node and link during each simulation time step and to penalize the surrogates for mass balance deviations during training finally the model configuration presented in eq 3 is generic and can be applied to other water systems wandel et al 2021 used a similar approach to simulate 3d fluid flows for graphics applications suggesting that we can derive similar surrogates for for example flows in secondary clarifiers in wastewater treatment or 2d surface flows in flood situations 5 conclusions we presented a new surrogate approach for simulating pipe hydraulics based on physics guided machine learning using generalized residue networks we anticipate that this approach will complement existing numerical models in initial design phases for drainage systems in automated calibration approaches and data assimilation as well as real time monitoring and control applications where fast simulations are required based on our results we draw the following conclusions 1 we can create surrogate models that simulate water levels flows and surcharges in all nodes and links of a drainage network in a manner that resembles a state of the art numerical engine with sufficient accuracy a current limitation is to appropriately capture fast flow reversal processes 2 compared to a numerical engine simulation times for long rainfall time series of several years are reduced between one and two orders of magnitude this enables fast and detailed drainage simulations in interactive workshop settings and in real time applications 3 surrogate training times for a drainage system with 60 links are currently in the order of one hour considering a single cpu transfer learning approaches and graph neural networks will likely enable significant reductions of training efforts in practice 4 implementing physical constraints in the surrogate in the form of mass balance calculations for surcharges improves performance compared to a purely data driven approach 5 surrogate training needs to cover the entire range of hydraulic situations for which the surrogate is intended to be used extreme events need to be oversampled in the training data to ensure that surrogates can accurately learn the dynamics of these situations and a sufficient variation between high and low inflows needs to be applied to all parts of the system generalized residue networks are a generic technique for time dependent modelling their application for dynamic simulations of other types of water systems is therefore an interesting research avenue that

15568,we propose and demonstrate a new approach for fast and accurate surrogate modelling of urban drainage system hydraulics based on physics guided machine learning the surrogates are trained against a limited set of simulation results from a hydrodynamic hifi model our approach reduces simulation times by one to two orders of magnitude compared to a hifi model it is thus slower than e g conceptual hydrological models but it enables simulations of water levels flows and surcharges in all nodes and links of a drainage network and thus largely preserves the level of detail provided by hifi models comparing time series simulated by the surrogate and the hifi model r2 values in the order of 0 9 are achieved surrogate training times are currently in the order of one hour however they can likely be reduced through the application of transfer learning and graph neural networks our surrogate approach will be useful for interactive workshops in initial design phases of urban drainage systems as well as for real time applications in addition our model formulation is generic and future research should investigate its application for simulating other water systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydrodynamic simulation scientific machine learning surrogate model urban drainage data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction computational modelling is essential in all phases of managing urban drainage systems uds from design to monitoring and control physics based deterministic models are widely used around the world these models solve saint venant s system of equations in small time steps for each pipe element abbott and ionescu 1967 we will refer to this approach as high fidelity models high fidelity hifi models are directly linked to physical system characteristics such as pipe diameter and length and both water levels and flows are simulated in a realistic manner which makes them attractive to practitioners however high simulation times limit stakeholder involvement in the design phase leskens et al 2014 as well as the exploration of impacts of deep uncertainties about future climates and urban developments löwe et al 2020 in addition real time applications such as warning and control usually require shorter simulation times than what is feasible with hifi models to circumvent these problems hydrologists have developed a number of so called lower fidelity surrogates razavi et al 2012 in particular a variety of conceptual or lumped hydrological models were developed for uds burger et al 2016 kroll et al 2017 moreno rodenas et al 2018 thrysøe et al 2019 all these approaches reduce computation times by orders of magnitude however they achieve speedup at the cost of simplifying the simulated processes or lowering the spatiotemporal resolution typically only flows are simulated not water levels and only few selected locations in the pipe network are considered the practical consequences are that the existing surrogates are valid only for a limited range of purposes e g sewer overflow but not flood risk are not straightforward to set up automatically from pipe databases and extrapolate poorly to a changing drainage system structure this limitation is not present for cellular automata approaches that only simplify the mathematical description of the processes but preserve the level of detail of the model austin et al 2014 however similarly small simulation time steps as with a numerical simulator must be selected limited speed ups in the order of factor 5 where therefore achieved machine learning approaches have gained traction in hydrology they are frequently applied in an input output setting including settings where physical system characteristics are used as inputs the resulting models can be transferable between catchments as demonstrated for example for rainfall runoff modelling kratzert et al 2019 and flood predictions bentivoglio et al 2022 löwe et al 2021 efforts have also been made to ensure conservation of mass frame et al 2022 both in rainfall runoff modelling and in hydraulics data driven approaches have also been integrated into numerical solvers with the aim of either simplifying numerical process equations uncovering unknown relationships or achieving better model fits techniques such as genetic programming danandeh mehr et al 2018 neural networks höge et al 2022 and curve fitting jamali et al 2021 were used while this approach can yield better fit with data and preserves physical interpretability it is subject to similar limitations as the cellular automata approach in terms of computational performance for example jamali et al 2021 achieved very limited reductions in simulation time for a problem involving solutions of the 2d shallow water equations in summary there is a gap for surrogate approaches that simulate the full hydraulics for the often many thousand states included in a hifi model while still achieving substantial reductions in simulation time in this paper we argue that scientific or physics informed machine learning karniadakis et al 2021 willard et al 2020 is an avenue worth investigating and we develop a proof of concept for this purpose other than purely data driven methods scientific machine learning seeks to integrate machine learning and established methods from scientific computing and statistics in order to utilize domain knowledge and known physical information in the learning process baker et al 2019 there is a rapid development of scientific machine learning methods that model differential and partial differential equation systems using both time discrete chen and xiu 2021 geneva and zabaras 2020 and time continuous approaches raissi et al 2019 wang et al 2021 these are partly based on earlier ideas hunt et al 1992 lagaris et al 1998 but embrace new contexts with technologies that were not available before the computational efficiency of neural networks enables models with large numbers of state variables this ability is relevant for uds where we often want to simulate water levels and flows in hundreds or thousands of links and nodes further scientific machine learning models learn interrelations between multiple states e g water levels in neighboring nodes and approaches that enable the exploitation of time series trends to increase simulation accuracy exist geneva and zabaras 2020 ren et al 2022 for hydraulics these properties may enable the consideration of larger simulation time steps than presented in the literature so far finally scientific machine learning enables multiple ways to incorporate physical system understanding into a data driven model e g in the form of physics guided model architectures mathematical constraints that enforce physical behavior or physics informed loss functions lu et al 2021 wang et al 2021 willard et al 2020 for this paper our ambition is to 1 develop a proof of concept for simulating the hydraulics of uds using scientific machine learning to our knowledge this has not been attempted before it enables fast surrogates that distinguish themselves from existing lumped approaches through high spatial detail and by considering flows levels and surcharges 2 specifically we build on generalized residue networks chen and xiu 2021 as suggested by garzón et al 2022 we incorporate inductive bias by designing a model architecture that is aligned with physical intuition about the hydraulic behavior of the pipe system 3 illustrate potentials as well as current bottlenecks and pitfalls when applying these techniques in a realistic setting with time varying rainfall inputs and complex pipe flow dynamics 4 draw up further research directions based on current developments in the literature 2 material and methods 2 1 principal concepts our aim is to construct a fast surrogate model for 1d hydrodynamics in pipes that enables the simulation of both water levels and flows in all nodes and links of an uds much like existing hifi models hifi models for uds s typically simulate catchment runoff independently subsequently it is routed through the nodes into the drainage network where hydraulics are simulated by numerically solving the saint venant equations the runoff simulation typically has marginal computational cost while the network simulation is computationally expensive thus we propose a surrogate model of the drainage network hydraulics only the hydraulic states of interest for each node in the drainage network are the water level in the node h the flow in upstream and downstream links q as well as excess flows q w for which we later will distinguish between frequently activated overflows q w o v e r f l o w and infrequently activated surcharges that cause pluvial flooding q w s u r c h a r g e fig 1 a because we focus only on the network component the surrogate model is given the runoff r as input and only predicts h q and q w fig 1b moreover the model is structured autoregressively the model predicts how the hydraulic states change from one time step to another given a vector of runoff inputs during this time step the predicted states are then used as the starting point for the next time step thus the model learns how the hydraulic states change over a time interval δ t considering surface runoff as a boundary condition once initialized the surrogate can independently simulate time periods of any duration given a series of runoff inputs similar autoregressive approaches were proposed earlier hunt et al 1992 but have not been adapted for hydrodynamics we will consider a surrogate time step δ t of 1 min which is well above the stability criteria for the hifi model the surrogate is trained against a limited set of simulation results from a hifi model so called labeled data 2 2 model formulation we start by introducing the concept of generalized residue networks then we provide a model formulation for urban drainage systems and finally we introduce physical system understanding into this model 2 2 1 generalized residue networks gresnet consider a dynamical system posed as an initial value problem with state vector x that changes over time t 1 d x d t f x t t o x t o x o we define the flow map as a real valued function that maps how the state vector of the system changes from time t to t δ t qin et al 2019 suggested that this flow map can be approximated by the function 2 x t δ t x t n x t θ where n is a deep feed forward neural network with parameters θ the principal idea of this approach is that the solution of the differential equation system in eq 1 is approximated by an euler scheme in discrete time steps δ t using an identity mapping of the model states and a deep neural network that learns the residue from data thereby capturing the system dynamics without knowing the true f x a priori initializing from some starting states x o eq 2 can be used to simulate the system forward in time chen and xiu 2021 extended the approach by replacing the identity mapping in eq 2 with a flexible operator mapping x t δ t l x t that facilitates training of the model l can in principle be any model approximation for the system when l is unknown they suggest that dynamic mode decomposition schmid 2010 is a good guess which in turn resembles a feed forward neural network l with a single hidden layer this leads to the formulation of generalized residue networks gresnet where l is a neural network with a single hidden layer 3 x t δ t l x t θ l n x t θ n 2 2 2 generalized residue networks for uds the model formulation in eq 3 is attractive for the simulation of urban drainage networks because it allows for the consideration of a large number of states in the vector x because we can consider various formulations of the neural network n that reflect different system complexities and because we can impose physical constraints on model predictions that will be introduced in the next section assuming that we want to use eq 3 to simulate an uds with n nodes and m links we consider a state vector that includes the water levels h in all nodes the flows q through all links and the excess flows q w from all nodes fig 1a 4 x t h 1 h n q 1 q m q w 1 q w n the state changes from one time step to another depending on the boundary conditions imposed on the system i e the vector of runoff volumes r t r 1 r n that enter the nodes in the considered time interval we therefore consider r t as an additional input to the deep neural network n while we preserve the purely state dependent formulation of the prior model l 5 x t δ t l x t θ l n x t r t θ n starting from some initial state values x 0 this model simulates water levels pipe flows and surcharge flows in time intervals δ t for each node and each link for which the model is trained 2 2 3 physics constrained generalized residue networks for uds predictions from the model in eq 5 are in no way constrained to a range that is physically reasonable beucler et al 2021 suggested in a similar setting that one way of ensuring physically appropriate behavior of the model is to introduce so called constraint layers c these can be interpreted as a post processing step after each prediction and calculate certain model states based on a physical understanding of the system 6 x t δ t c l x t θ l n x t r t θ n an import learning from initial experiments with eq 5 was that surcharge flows q w s u r c h a r g e were difficult to learn for a purely data driven model however surcharge flows occur only when the water level in a node reaches the ground level and the connected pipes exceed their capacity in this situation the water volume stored in the pipe network remains constant and q w s u r c h a r g e can be computed from a mass balance calculation that is performed locally for each node therefore we suggest a revised model formulation where the state vector eq 4 is reduced to only include water levels and pipe flows 7 x t h 1 h n q 1 q m surcharges are subsequently calculated in a constraint layer as the difference between all the inflows to a node i from upstream pipe elements considering the link flow values predicted by the gresnet and runoff and the outflow to all downstream pipe elements in addition we enforce a minimum of 0 for surcharge flows because we perform hifi simulations in spilling configuration i e surcharging water does not reenter the drainage system this configuration was shown to yield more realistic representations of pressure levels in intense rain storms than the widely used ponding configuration jamali et al 2018 8 q w i max j q u s i j k q d s i k r i 0 note that while we have removed q w from the state vector we still consider all states h q and q w when computing the deviation between hifi model and surrogate during training section 0 thus the mass balance computation affects the parameter estimates of the gresnet 2 3 surrogate training the proposed model includes parameter sets θ l and θ n that need to be estimated for this purpose we simulate rainfall series of limited duration in a hifi model and extract time series of the simulated hydraulic states for all nodes and links in 1 min resolution the surrogate parameters are estimated by minimizing the mean squared error mse between the labels generated by the hifi model and the corresponding hydraulic states simulated by the surrogate when computing mse all three state variables h q and q w are considered for all nodes and links irrespective of the model version all states are scaled to the range 0 1 before computing mse to ensure that all state variables have approximately equal impact on the parameter estimates scaling is performed using a min max approach pedregosa et al 2011 and the scaling range is defined individually for each state variable based on the minimum and maximum values observed in the hifi simulations as illustrated in fig 1c surrogate development is divided into training validation and testing steps to enable faster processing the training series is divided into chunks windows that can be simulated in parallel the surrogate is initialized from the hifi results at the beginning of a window and then independently simulates the hydraulic states for a number of time steps corresponding to the so called window size a window size of one time step maximizes the potential for parallel processing and will thus yield the fastest training however it also entails a high risk of overfitting because the surrogate is initialized from the true values at each time step and thus never forced to generate stable simulations in the training phase the window approach implies that the surrogate is trained considering a variety of starting values for the states in the validation and testing steps surrogate simulations are initialized from an empty pipe system 2 4 technical implementation surrogate models were implemented in python 3 8 using google s tensorflow library version 2 7 0 abadi et al 2016 parameter estimation was performed over 2 000 epochs or optimizer iterations using the adam algorithm kingma and ba 2014 the learning rate is a key parameter that affects how aggressively the optimizer changes parameters it was by trial and error configured with a starting value of 1e 3 which exponentially decayed to 1e 4 to avoid divergence in the end of the training you et al 2019 we stopped training preliminarily if the validation mse did not decrease for 500 epochs in a row relu activation functions were used in the hidden layers of the neural networks based on initial experiments and because they are the current standard for deep neural networks goodfellow et al 2016 2 5 design of experiments 2 5 1 catchment and hifi model we considered two medium sized test systems extracted from a real uds in bochum germany fig 2 system 1 includes 60 pipes and a catchment area of 14 ha while system 2 includes 87 links and a catchment area of 26 ha except for the outlets all nodes are equipped with a spilling weir placed near ground level to simulate water discharged to the surface system 1 includes an overflow at node 27793 with a weir crest just above the top of the pipe level this overflow occurs more frequent than spills which may affect surrogate training system 2 includes a basin with a volume of 140 m3 close to the outlet the basin outflow is throttled to a maximum of 0 6 m3 s and the connected overflow weir crest is placed 3 m above invert level the basin thus creates backwater in the surrounding pipe stretches we used system 1 to develop the proposed surrogate configuration while system 2 was used to validate the approach in a more challenging system with looped network connections and fast backwater dynamics detailed system properties are provided in the supporting information 2 5 2 training validation and testing data we generated training validation and testing data for the development of surrogates by performing hydrodynamic simulations with the mike 1d engine dhi 2021 for surrogate training and validation we performed hydrodynamic simulations using two different sets of rainfall series as input a we considered 40 years of rainfall observations in 1 min resolution from a gauge in odense that is part of the danish svk network we identified rain events see supporting information and manually selected 154 rain events for training and 43 rain events for validation we aimed to include events with different temporal variations and intensities the selected events were concatenated into one series resulting in a training series consisting of 73 990 one minute data points and a validation series of 19 095 data points b we aimed to create a rainfall series where extreme events were overrepresented to facilitate surrogate training for these situations we repeated the above process considering 10 rain gauges from various locations in denmark each with 40 years of rainfall observations we manually selected 203 events for training and 58 events for validation from the pool of events we considered all rainstorms where flooding would be likely to occur and generally focused our selection on intense rainstorms the events were again concatenated into one series resulting in a training series of 74 769 time steps and a validation series of 21 700 time steps all surrogates were tested by performing simulations for a rainfall series consisting of 40 years of continuous observations in næstved denmark 8200 events this series was not considered in the creation of datasets a or b the gauge is located approximately 30 km away from the nearest gauge considered in the creation of dataset b and was intended as a fully independent test series 2 5 3 summary of experiments the technical implementation of our surrogates has two main hyperparameters these are the window size used for subdividing the training data series see section 2 3 as well as the complexity of the neural network n that is used to model the residue of the linear predictor l see eq 5 to identify a reasonable configuration we compared m s e obtained on the validation dataset so called validation loss and training times for the hyperparameter configurations shown in table 1 this process was repeated five times for each combination of hyper parameters because different random initializations of the parameters in the neural networks lead to slightly different validation losses subsequently we selected the configuration with the best compromise between validation loss and computational efficiency and compared surrogate configurations with and without physical constraints that were trained on datasets a or b finally the preferred configuration was tested on system 2 2 6 scoring criteria to compare the surrogate simulations against hifi simulations we considered widely used scoring criteria that were computed for the testing series we considered rmse and r2 to measure both average and event based performance of the surrogates all scores were computed in the untransformed space i e the units of rmse are meter for water levels and m3 s for flows we evaluated the total excess flow volume t q w i t for individual nodes during individual rain events to assess whether overflows and surcharges were predicted in the correct locations and with accurate magnitude finally to evaluate whether the model results are biased we compared total runoff surcharge overflow and outflow volumes 3 results 3 1 hyperparameter selection fig 3 illustrates the validation loss smallest validation m s e obtained during training for different combinations of neural network configuration and window size considering surrogates that included physical constraints for surcharges and that were trained on series a the results for this surrogate configuration illustrate the considerations arising during training results for other surrogate configurations are included in the supporting information smaller window sizes allow faster training of the surrogates when parallel processing is exploited but increase the risk of overfitting this issue is very clear from the figure where models trained with window sizes of 1 and in some cases 10 min yield substantially larger validation losses surrogates with too few parameters lead to unstable validation results because they have difficulties learning the dynamics of the system considering also the results obtained for data series b supporting information network sizes s3 and s4 are preferable moving from neural network size s1 to s4 computation times per epoch on a single cpu increased moderately in the order of 30 considering the more stable convergence properties of the more complex models we moved forward with network size s4 and a window size of 60 min for the remaining study experiments with more complex neural networks did not yield better convergence in the tested sewer systems supporting information 3 2 effects of training series and physical constraints on event based performance fig 4 shows rmse computed for h q q w o v e r f l o w and q w s u r c h a r g e for individual rain events in system 1 the presented results were generated from surrogates trained on data series b amongst the 5 training iterations for each model fig 3 we show results for the best performing model without physical constraints lowest validation loss and the worst performing model with physical constraints highest validation loss we used the peak flow simulated by the hifi model at the outlet to distinguish low and high flow conditions in the figure a general increase of rmse can be observed for high flow conditions this may be linked to a change of dynamics in extreme flow situations and the relatively fewer occurrences of such situations even in data series b nevertheless rmse values for levels and flows are in the range of few cm and few l s respectively this suggests that the surrogates generally achieve high accuracy rmse values for water levels and flows are slightly higher for the model considering physical constraints in this model configuration the simulated water levels are tied to the activation of mass balance computations for excess flows thus the surrogate has less freedom to fit the water level data than the model without constraints in contrast the model including physical constraints achieves much lower rmse values for q w o v e r f l o w and q w s u r c h a r g e panels c and d deviations in low flow conditions where the hifi model does not simulate excess flow are entirely removed in addition smaller rmse values are also achieved in periods where excess flows occur fig 5 analyses the behavior of predicted overflows and surcharges in system 1 more in depth the figure compares total overflow and surcharge volumes for individual rain events in the testing dataset considering each node individually panels a and c consider surrogates trained on data series a while panels b and c consider surrogates trained on data series b comparing the two surrogate configurations we can conclude that the introduction of physical constraints leads to a much better representation of excess flows however comparing panels a and c against panels b and d a clear effect of the training series is also noticeable when trained on series a predictions of overflow and surcharge volumes are slightly more uncertain because these events are too sparse in the training data the predicted water levels and link flows are then not properly tuned to enable an accurate mass balance calculation considering training series b especially the errors for surcharges are much reduced because these situations now occur sufficiently often during training to enable the surrogate to learn the corresponding dynamics 3 3 time averaged test scores fig 6 shows score values for the different hydraulic states as well as total water volumes that enter and leave the models we compare the score values obtained for different surrogate configurations in system 1 stage 2 in addition we compare the performance of the surrogate configuration that was trained on series b and includes physical constraints between systems 1 and 2 as already indicated by the previous results imposing physical constraints led to improved simulations of surcharges and overflows which is indicated by improved rmse values panel a much improved r2 values panel b and reduced volume errors panel c comparing the two model configurations with physical constraints the performance of the surrogates trained on different data series was very similar however surrogates trained on series b yielded slightly lower rmse values and slightly higher r2 values similar average score values where obtained for systems 1 and 2 with the exception of higher average rmse scores that can be associated with larger flows in this system 3 4 surrogate performance in specific elements fig 7 illustrates for the surrogate with physical constraints how the accuracy of simulated water levels and link flows varies in space figs 8 and 9 show time series plots for the elements highlighted in fig 7 in the time series plots we again consider the worst performing surrogate across 5 training iterations figs 7 and 8 generally suggest strong performance in system 1 the hydrographs clarify that surrogates without physical constraints create false predictions of excess flows q w with both positive and negative signs these issues are more pronounced for surcharges panel d than for overflows panel c the latter occur more frequently in the dataset and are thus easier to learn for the surrogate the issue is avoided when introducing physical constraints for surcharge predictions into the surrogate a limitation becomes clear from lower r2 in some upstream links and nodes in the center of the catchment in this area the connected sub catchments have very low imperviousness ratios resulting in small infrequent pipe flows the surrogate can then not learn the relationship between inflow and hydraulics this issue can be avoided by ensuring that training data are generated in such a way that high and low inflow situations occur in all parts of the system for system 2 figs 7 and 9 similar illustrate strong surrogate performance except for locations where fast flow reversals occur in these locations the surrogate is only partly able to simulate the flow reversal and quite similar to the surcharge results without physical constraints creates false predictions of small flows with both positive and negative signs in low flow conditions that lead to very low r2 values note that these issues do not affect surrogate performance in the remaining system 3 5 computation time table 2 compares computational effort for training and running the surrogates against the time required to simulate the testing series in the hifi model the surrogates are currently trained against results from a hifi simulations therefore we also included the time required to perform these simulations for the training and validation dataset label generation tests were performed on an hp zbook g9 with intel core i9 10885h processor and 32gb ram all tests were performed using a single cpu only training times ranged between 0 5 and 2 h surrogates trained on data series a generally converged faster which may be related to the less complicated dynamics in this series surrogates including physical constraints were in the order of 10 faster than surrogates without physical constraints because the surrogates included 33 fewer state variables excess flows q w were instead computed efficiently in a postprocessing step prediction times for the testing series 8 200 rain events were in the order of 100 s and thus in a range that enables real time applications as well as interactive simulations in workshop settings for hifi simulations we considered a fixed simulation time step of 5 s note that the simulation time step of a hifi model can both be lower or higher depending on the hydraulic conditions in the specific system and if adaptive time stepping schemes dhi 2021 are employed surrogate simulation times will remain constant as long as the same simulation time step here one minute is considered however prediction accuracy may be reduced in some situations while we tested computation times in a single cpu setting the surrogates can exploit parallel computing which is important for implementation we did not achieve reduced simulation times by employing gpus this is most likely due to the autoregressive character of the models which implies that the technical implementation includes a loop over a time series the higher processing speed of cpus then outperforms the parallelization capacities of gpus 4 discussion 4 1 results and limitations the results shown in the previous section illustrate that our surrogate modelling approach can simulate water levels flows overflows and surcharges much alike a state of the art hydrodynamic model the surrogates enable long time series simulations in our case 8 200 rain events extracted from 40 years of rainfall observations of water levels flows and surcharges in all nodes and pipes of a drainage system within few minutes while these results are promising our work has several clear limitations that will need to be addressed in further research to make the approach applicable in practice 1 our test cases are examples of typical drainage networks including overflows and surcharges loops and backwater situations but all pipes are circular and no controlled structures are included the results suggest that the current surrogate configuration can only to a limited extent simulate fast flow reversal dynamics this issue does however not propagate to other parts of the system because the surrogate simplistically speaking simulates hydraulics based on correlations between inputs and states rather than iteratively our current surrogate formulation may have difficulties to learn the dynamics in systems with very irregular cross sections e g when simulating open water bodies or trunk sewers that can be dominated by inflows in few selected points potential improvements are outlined in section 4 3 but there will be hydraulic situations that a surrogate cannot fully simulate these limitations need not impair its applicability for assessing for example surcharge frequencies in practice we can support the user by highlighting the accuracy of simulations for the validation series in all links and nodes 2 one avenue for upscaling our approach to large drainage systems is to subdivide the drainage network into many small subsections each of which is simulated by an independent sub model see section 4 2 implementing such an approach requires that sub models can be trained independently from each other and subsequently generate accurate simulations for the combined systems we have not documented such approaches 3 we have not considered the effect of controlled actuators such as pumps or moveable weirs in many cases the water level in a controlled actuator can be derived using simple mass balance calculations that consider storage volume and the controlled outflow balla et al 2022 similar to the previous point the main challenge is then to develop dedicated training approaches such that the surrogate learns to simulate the system dynamics given one or more water level boundaries 4 we created artificial rainfall series for training the surrogates these were defined based on hydrological intuition with the aim of representing the range of relevant dynamics we have not investigated how many data points should be included in the training series structured approaches for selecting the rain events included in the training data e g allen et al 2022 may enable surrogate training with shorter series and reduced training times 5 fig 8 suggests a clear dependency between the complexity of the neural network included in the surrogate model and the accuracy of the simulations in general we would expect that an increase of the number of state variables in the model requires that more complex neural networks with more parameters are needed in the surrogate to achieve sufficient accuracy the form of this relationship is currently unknown further better convergence properties may be obtained with alternative network architectures that for example employ separate neural networks for water levels and flows or replicate more advanced numerical solution schemes than the euler scheme used in our work wang and lin 1998 6 all simulations in our study considered a uniform distribution of rainfall in space for our test cases this assumption is quite realistic however surrogate developments for larger drainage systems will need to consider spatial rainfall variations 7 while pipe flow simulations are performed with high accuracy we are not currently enforcing mass balance in the model architecture 8 surrogate accuracy was compared solely against hifi simulations while the hifi model does not necessarily reflect reality pedersen et al 2022 4 2 upscaling to large drainage networks in its current configuration our surrogate approach enables assessments of how changes in urban runoff affect sewer overflows surcharge frequencies and wastewater treatment plant inflow within a few minutes and thus sufficiently fast however any modifications of the hydraulic behavior of the pipe system will require retraining of the surrogate models in workshop settings it is infeasible to perform retraining of surrogates for large drainage networks with many thousand links however if the model is divided into subsystems then only smaller submodels where changes are made will need to be retrained this approach raises issues in ensuring that multiple submodels interact in a stable and hydraulically appropriate manner however it is common practice to identify hydraulically simple locations for subdividing urban drainage networks when setting up conceptual models kroll et al 2017 and the process can be automated johansen and skindhøj 2022 another option would be to use conceptual models to simulate the main flows in the sewer network and then to use these simulations as inflow boundary to the hydraulic surrogates presented in our study this approach would yield guaranteed mass conservative simulations while extending conceptual models with hydraulic detail that is not available today it would also offer a straight forward setting for implementing controlled actuators as part of the conceptual model 4 3 research perspectives we anticipate that future research can much improve our surrogate approach by reducing training times and incorporating additional physical constraints into the model architecture in terms of reduced training efforts graph neural networks zhou et al 2020 enable the creation of surrogates where new states for a node or pipe are predicted based on the current state of its neighbors while the approach presented in our paper considers all states in the drainage network as input to a single neural network graph approaches would process each node and link individually when combined with physical system properties such as pipe lengths and slopes the resulting surrogates may become transferable across catchments the approach may also improve simulations of flow reversal because the hydraulics in each node and link would be predicted depending on the current state of the neighboring nodes and links physics informed loss functions raissi et al 2019 wang et al 2021 could enable surrogate training without generating training data in a hydrodynamic model first while training times would increase it may be attractive from a practical viewpoint to avoid data management and stability issues associated with automated handling of a numerical engine in addition physics informed loss functions may enable bypassing numerical simplifications that are commonly implemented in commercial software packages for drainage system simulation because the surrogate can be trained directly against the pde system finally transfer learning jin et al 2021 i e initializing the surrogate parameters based on experience from previous training iterations is likely to enable surrogate training in much fewer epochs than documented in our paper we have far from exploited all opportunities for implementing physical knowledge into the surrogates for example flow formulas were used in the development of cellular automate for drainage networks austin et al 2014 and could be incorporated into the l term in eq 3 to generate robust flow predictions another relevant consideration would be to compute volume changes in each node and link during each simulation time step and to penalize the surrogates for mass balance deviations during training finally the model configuration presented in eq 3 is generic and can be applied to other water systems wandel et al 2021 used a similar approach to simulate 3d fluid flows for graphics applications suggesting that we can derive similar surrogates for for example flows in secondary clarifiers in wastewater treatment or 2d surface flows in flood situations 5 conclusions we presented a new surrogate approach for simulating pipe hydraulics based on physics guided machine learning using generalized residue networks we anticipate that this approach will complement existing numerical models in initial design phases for drainage systems in automated calibration approaches and data assimilation as well as real time monitoring and control applications where fast simulations are required based on our results we draw the following conclusions 1 we can create surrogate models that simulate water levels flows and surcharges in all nodes and links of a drainage network in a manner that resembles a state of the art numerical engine with sufficient accuracy a current limitation is to appropriately capture fast flow reversal processes 2 compared to a numerical engine simulation times for long rainfall time series of several years are reduced between one and two orders of magnitude this enables fast and detailed drainage simulations in interactive workshop settings and in real time applications 3 surrogate training times for a drainage system with 60 links are currently in the order of one hour considering a single cpu transfer learning approaches and graph neural networks will likely enable significant reductions of training efforts in practice 4 implementing physical constraints in the surrogate in the form of mass balance calculations for surcharges improves performance compared to a purely data driven approach 5 surrogate training needs to cover the entire range of hydraulic situations for which the surrogate is intended to be used extreme events need to be oversampled in the training data to ensure that surrogates can accurately learn the dynamics of these situations and a sufficient variation between high and low inflows needs to be applied to all parts of the system generalized residue networks are a generic technique for time dependent modelling their application for dynamic simulations of other types of water systems is therefore an interesting research avenue that

15569,the removal of emerging organic micropollutants omps in anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs has garnered considerable attention owing to the rapid development of anmbr technology and the increased environmental risk caused by omp discharge we investigated the removal efficiency of 22 typical omps from sewage being treated in an anmbr and implemented and evaluated an upgrading strategy by adding biochar the average removal efficiency of omps was only 76 8 due to hydrophilic omps containing electron withdrawing groups ketoprofen ibuprofen diclofenac and carbamazepine being poorly removed biochar addition 5 0 g l promoted the removal of recalcitrant omps by 45 leading to an enhanced removal efficiency of 88 7 although biochar has a high adsorption capacity to different omps the biotransformation rather than sorption removal efficiency of 13 of the 22 omps was largely enhanced suggesting that adsorption biotransformation was the main approach by which biochar enhances the omp removal biotransformation test and microbial analysis revealed that the enrichment of species flavobacterium massilia acinetobacter and cloacibacterium involved in omp biotransformation on biochar contributed largely to the enhanced biotransformation removal efficiency of omps in this way the enhanced electron transfer activity and syntrophic metabolism between hydrogenotrophic methanogens and species that oxidize acetate to h2 co2 on biochar jointly contributed to the stable ch4 production and omp biotransformation this study provides a promising strategy to enhance the omp removal in anmbrs and improves our understanding of the underlying mechanism of biochar amended omp removal in anaerobic treatment systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords organic

the removal of organic micropollutants omps in wastewater treatment systems clara et al 2005 melvin and leusch 2016 radjenovic et al 2009 compared with aerobic mbrs anaerobic mbrs anmbrs operating under anaerobic conditions consume lower energy and can produce renewable energy hu et al 2020 and provide a promising alternative to aerobic mbrs considering the requirement of sustainable wastewater treatment kong et al 2021 the removal efficiency of some omps such as caffeine clozapine and triclocarban tcc in anmbrs is comparable to that in aerobic mbrs zhang et al 2021 however anmbrs are still inferior to aerobic mbrs in terms of omps removal some recalcitrant omps such as ketoprofen kp bisphenol a bpa and ibuprofen ibp that have low biotransformation rates under anaerobic conditions cannot be efficiently removed by anmbrs liu et al 2020 therefore anmbrs face more challenges than aerobic mbrs rysz et al 2013 suarez et al 2010 thus strengthening strategies to enhance omp removal in anmbrs has garnered the interest of experts in this field incorporating additives and bio electrochemical strength are two effective methods to enhance omp removal in anaerobic treatment systems diehl and lapara 2010 dutta et al 2014 guo et al 2017 zhao et al 2020 considering the system configuration and operation cost incorporating additives is more promising when integrated with anmbrs various kinds of additives including granular activated carbon gac dutta et al 2014 powdery activated carbon pac xiao et al 2017 biochar jiang et al 2019 tang et al 2021 and fe3o4 zhao et al 2020 have been employed and evaluated in previous studies among them pac and gac were widely adopted considering their good adoptability based on the large specific area however removing omps by adding activated carbon relies heavily on the adsorption of activated carbon xiao et al 2017 leading to the regular replacement or continuous addition of activated carbon to sustain the removal performance in long term operations this results in an unavoidable increase in the operation cost recently unactivated biochar derived from agricultural waste through direct pyrolysis at a low temperature is reported to be a promising alternative for activated carbon in anaerobic treatment to enhance omp removal li et al 2020 the author found that gac and biochar have comparable promoting effects on the biotransformation of phenol during anaerobic digestion while the underlying mechanisms are different wang et al 2020 speculated that the redox based electron exchange capacity of biochar accelerated the syntrophic phenol oxidation for methanogenesis through direct interspecies electron transfer from the enrichment of geobacter and methanosaeta similar results are also reported in a subsequent study wherein biochar elevated the tetracycline removal efficiency by 24 158 by boosting the biotransformation pathway in swine manure digestion wang et al 2021 these studies demonstrated that adding biochar is a powerful strategy for enhancing omp removal in anaerobic treatment systems however the focus of these studies was on the impacts of biochar on anaerobic digestion rather than omp removal the syntrophy between bacteria and archaea was over stressed while the specific microbes involved in omp degradation were not comprehensively analyzed moreover these studies were conducted on a short term basis with the addition of only one omp the achievements relevant to omp removal are specific and cannot be generalized for omps with different properties gonzalez gil et al 2018a this work aimed to study the enhancement of biochar addition to omp removal in anmbr treating sewage the specific objectives were to i investigate the impact of chemical structure and hydrophobicity on the omp removal efficiency in an anaerobic treatment system ii analyze the omp removal pathways and the strengthen of biochar to the sorption and biodegradation behaviors of omp with different chemical structures and hydrophobicity iii unravel the enhancement pathways of biochar to omp removal the results provide valuable information for omp removal in anmbr and illustrate that adding biochar is a promising approach to strengthening omp removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 anmbr configuration and operating protocol a previously reported lab scale submerged anmbr has an operating volume of 6 0 l was employed in this study lei et al 2021b wherein two membrane modules assembled by hydrophilic modified polyvinylidene fluoride membrane pore size of 0 2 μm were installed fig s1 synthetic sewage

respectively the synthetic sewage compositions and omp physicochemical properties are provided in tables s1 and s2 hydraulic retention time hrt of the anmbr was set at 3 2 h in the experiment the anmbr was operated for over 60 days to reach a stable treatment performance cod removal of around 95 before experimental data collection subsequently the omp removal performance of the anmbr was investigated without and with biochar successively the mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss concentration excluding biochar in the anmbr was 9 0 1 5 g l and the srt calculated excluding the mass of biochar was kept at approximately 180 days corncob derived granular biochar prepared through one step pyrolysis at a low temperature 500 c was adopted with a dosage of 4 0 g l in this study the specific biochar preparation procedure refers to a previous study lei et al 2021a during the experiment sludge was discharged every two days to sustain a stable mlvss concentration biochar discharged from the anmbr was sieved and recycled to the reactor to avoid biochar loss 2 2 batch tests as two typical omp removal pathways in biological treatment systems sorption and biotransformation behaviors were tested to identify the sludge and biochar sorption capacity to different omps the biotransformation potential of different omps and the impact of biochar 2 2 1 batch

biochar using milli q water respectively and have the same sludge and biochar concentrations to the anmbr 100 ml of suspended liquid was added to a 120 ml glass serum flask and the headspace was purged with nitrogen gas for 5 min to remove any oxygen 0 1 ml of omp stock solution was added into the serum flask by a syringe to reach an initial omp concentration of 100 μg l the sealed serum flasks were then incubated in a shaker 115 rpm 25 c the sorption test was conducted for 240 min and regularly sampled for the omp concentration analysis until sorption equilibrium was achieved the

sludge a permutation test was performed at a 5 significance level using the stamp software p 0 05 v 2 1 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 omp removal in the anmbr the cod removal efficiency of the anmbr was around 95 0 0 9 at hrt 3 2 h 0 40 d and biogas production reached 1 14 0 18 l l reactor d wherein the ch4 percentage was over 83 resulting in a high cod converted to methane rate over 82 fig s3 the average removal efficiency of the twenty two omps was 75 7 20 3 fig 1 and the removal efficiency of different omps varied in a wide range these omps were divided into hydrophobic log d 3 2 and hydrophilic log d 3 2 omps according to the standard log d value ph 7 0 extracted from the scifinder database all hydrophobic omps reached a high removal efficiency of over 80 much higher than the hydrophilic omps suggesting that hydrophobicity is a key factor for omp removal this is mainly because the hydrophobicity determines sludge sorption capacity to omps liu et al 2020 monsalvo et al 2014 wijekoon et al 2015 nevertheless the removal efficiency of hydrophilic omps does not strictly obey the hydrophobicity the values varied from 21 1 ibp to 96 9 trimethoprim tmp this may be caused by differences in chemical structure and functional groups of different omps the impacts of functional groups on removal efficiency showed that omps containing electron donating groups edgs reached a removal efficiency of over 70 regardless of the log d values in comparison the removal efficiency of omps containing electron withdrawing groups ewgs varied in a wide range from 27 2 to over 84 0 hydrophilic omps containing ewgs including kp ibp dcf and carbamazepine cbz had low removal efficiencies of 50 while hydrophobic omps containing ewgs including 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 tcs and 3 4 methylbenzyliden camphor mbc reached high removal efficiencies of over 80 these results are consistent with previous studies in which hydrophilic omps containing strong ewgs showed low removal efficiencies under anaerobic conditions chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 this is mainly because 1 hydrophilic compounds can be easily discharged from the anmbr in the effluent owing to a low absorption quantity and 2 the presence of ewgs in the chemical structure can generate an electron deficiency which makes the omp difficult to serve as an oxidizing agent zhang et al 2021 therefore necessary enhancement methods need to be implemented to strengthen the removal of hydrophilic omps containing ewgs notably all nine omps containing both electron withdrawing and electron donating groups ewdgs reached high removal efficiencies of over 80 regardless of the log d value suggesting that the co occurrence of dwgs and edgs facilitates omp removal sorption and biotransformation are two typical pathways for omp removal in biological treatment systems clara et al 2005 liu et al 2020 the sorption quantity of sludge to different omps varied in a wide range mainly because of the difference in log d values fig 2 a sludge sorption to omps with a log d of 3 2 including celestolide clt mbc tcs oxybenzone bp3 avobenzone avb and triclocarban tcc reached 320 660 ng g mlvss much higher than that of omps with a log d value 3 2 230 ng g mlvss except for atenolol ate and bp4 moreover the sorption removal efficiency has a significant positive linear correlation with log d p 0 01 fig 2a confirming that log d is an important factor that determines the omp removal through sorption biotransformation of omp is impacted by the log d and functional groups the presence of ewgs generally facilitates the reductive biotransformation of omp under anaerobic conditions alvarino et al 2018 wijekoon et al 2015 while the hydrophilic omps including dcf and cbz had a low biotransformation removal efficiency of 15 6 and 12 3 respectively this should be attributed to the presence of the chloro or amide groups in the chemical structure dutta et al 2014 song et al 2018 the other five omps containing ewgs achieved an average biotransformation efficiency of 28 9 6 5 which was slightly lower than that of omps containing edgs promotion of ewgs to omp biotransformation was not observed in this study biotransformation accounted for 84 1 12 2 of the total quantity of hydrophilic omps containing ewdgs leading to a low sorption removal efficiency of 4 2 3 0 possibly because the presence of ewdgs increased the biotransformation of omps however sorption was still the predominant pathway for the removal of hydrophobic omps containing ewdgs removal efficiency was 51 6 6 5 although the contribution of biotransformation cannot be overlooked removal efficiency was 30 4 7 3 this confirmed the significance of hydrophobicity in the removal of omps omp removal efficiency in this study is comparable to it reported in previous studies employing anmbr table s6 liu et al 2020 monsalvo et al 2014 wijekoon et al 2015 while the biotransformation efficiency of several omps including ate e3 kp tc and tt is much lower than it in aerobic mbrs gurung et al 2019 in addition ibp dcf cbz and kp have low efficiencies in anmbrs mainly because of their poor biodegradability at anaerobic condition grandclément et al 2017 therefore practicable strengthening strategies for the removal and biotransformation of these omps need to be developed and evaluated 3 2 biochar strengthened omp removal in the anmbr biochar was added into the anmbr on day 98 and no obvious impacts on the cod removal efficiency 95 1 0 6 and biogas production 1 14 0 18 l l reactor d were observed fig s3 while the removal efficiency of omps has a remarkable increase fig 3 the percentage of seven omps in the effluent showed a significant decrease p 0 05 data difference over ten percentual points which resulted in a large increase in the removal efficiency of omps from 75 7 20 3 to 89 4 6 0 especially for kp dcf ibp and cbz their removal efficiencies were improved by over 45 and average removal efficiency of 88 7 was achieved this efficiency is comparable to it in an anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor filled with commercial granular activated carbon with a high packing ratio 50 in the membrane tank dutta et al 2014 these results demonstrate that adding biochar with a low dosage is a commercial and practicable approach for enhancing omp removal performance when treating sewage using anmbr sorption is conventionally considered to play a primary role when typical carbon based materials were employed to enhance omp removal xu et al 2021 in this study although biochar prepared at a low temperature without activation results in a lower specific surface area than commercially activated carbon a sorption capacity of 160 420 μg g ss can be achieved for different omps fig s4 table s7 the sorption capacity is 40 80 times higher than that of the sludge flocs the high sorption of biochar to omps is conducive to improving omps removal efficiency which can also be demonstrated by the increased sorption removal efficiency of ate bp4 and tcc fig 3 the promotion of biochar to biotransformation is more worth being valued when compared with sorption biotransformation efficiency of thirteen omps was significantly enhanced after adding biochar p 0 05 data difference over ten percentual points fig 3 similar results were also reported in several previous studies table 2 xiao et al 2017 found that a low dosage of pac 1 0 g l enhanced the biotransformation of smx and tcs in a pac anmbr while it weakly impacted the biotransformation of cbz and dcf in another staged anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor safmbr using gac as the medium at a high packing ratio of 25 50 high efficiency omp removal was achieved regardless of the omp properties dutta et al 2014 lim et al 2019 the author suspected that adsorption to gac and biotransformation in the biofilm formed on the gac surface were the main removal pathways for omps however the mechanism of enhancing omp biotransformation through biochar seems not identical to activated carbon as strengthened biotransformation was also observed in a short term batch test fig 4 wherein the enrichment of specific microbes on biochar is faint as shown in fig 4 and table s8 the biotransformation potential of cbz kp ee2 tc and tcc were significantly enhanced p 0 05 these omps were classified into pharmaceuticals and hormones they may suppress microbial activities when present in the mixed liquor silva et al 2020 biochar adsorption to these omps helps prevent their adverse effects on microbes thereby strengthening omp biotransformation in addition the rmax of e3 kp cbz ee2 tcs smx npx and bp3 significantly increased with the addition of biochar p 0 05 fig 5 biochar accelerated the biochemical reaction rate of omps the electron transfer system activity of the sludge system was increased from 3 3 0 4 to 4 5 0 2 μg mg h p 0 05 with the addition of biochar owning to the promotion of quinone hydroquinone groups c o and co on biochar to electron transfer wang et al 2020 this is supposed to be the mechanism that biochar directly strengthens omp biotransformation 3 3 biochar enriched functional species that biotransforming omps biochar only strengthened the biotransformation of five omps significantly in the bath test while the biotransformation of thirteen omps was significantly strengthened in the anmbr with biochar added this demonstrates acclimating specific species capable of degrading omps on biochar played an important role for strengthening omp removal in the amended anmbr with biochar firmicutes 27 5 bacteroidetes 14 7 chloroflexi 8 74 acidobacteria 2 84 and proteobacteria 1 59 dominated the microbial community in the sludge abundance 1 0 fig s5 biochar showed little impact on the microbial community in sludge at the phylum level while it created a unique microflora on the biochar that differs from it in sludge the minority phylum in sludge including proteobacteria and synergistetes became the predominant on biochar and the abundance of firmicutes and bacteroidetes on biochar also showed obvious differences from those in sludge fig s5 at the genus level bacteria in sludge samples of anmbr and anmbr with biochar have similar species compositions with macellibacteroides proteocatella acetoanaerobium gp6 saccharofermentans and anaerovorax being predominant abundance 0 5 fig 6 a the microbial community in this system is distinct from that in our previous study when treating similar sewage without omps lei et al 2020 conventional fermenters and acid syntrophic acetate producers lost dominance in the system the predominance of these genera in the system may be associated with their potential resistance to omps for instance a high abundance of macellibacteroides 65 7 71 7 was reported in the treatment of wastewater containing oxytetracycline and the abundance was positively correlated with the oxytetracycline concentration he et al 2020 this genus can also provide fermentation functions to some extent in the anaerobic system rout et al 2017 proteocatella was reported to have proteolytic chitinolytic and amylolytic activities and was capable of producing acid or secreting hydrolase li et al 2018 saccharofermentans could use complex organic matter to produce acetate zheng et al 2018 and was reported to be enriched in an anaerobic digestion system containing high smx and norfloxacin concentrations acetoanaerobium and anaerovorax are both fermentation microorganisms that can convert protein putrescine glucose and amino acids to butyrate acetate hydrogen and carbon dioxide supaphol et al 2011 acetoanaerobium has a synergistic relationship with exoelectrogens in the degradation of complex organic matter liu et al 2016 anaerovorax was reported to be the main species when treating norfloxacin using anaerobic digestion and plays an important role in the biotransformation of omps zhu et al 2021 biochar addition largely promoted the enrichment of functional microbes that degrade omps fig 6b massilia and flavobacterium were significantly enriched on the biochar surface p 0 05 these species were reported as functional bacteria in the anaerobic biotransformation omps ke et al 2014 qin et al 2020 protecocatella gp6 and saccharofermentans reported as common fermenters were much lower than that on biochar surface p 0 05 massilia 17 3 flavobacterium 8 37 and macellibacteroides 3 55 are the predominant bacteria on biochar and several genera that are generally involved in omps transformation including cloacibacterium 1 85 acinetobacter 1 58 chryseobacterium 1 19 pseudomonas 1 09 and cloacibacillus 0 81 were also identified with a relatively high abundance on biochar liu and pop 2009 ou et al 2016 romero fierro et al 2021 moreover chryseobacterium and cloacibacillus that could assimilate acetate were also enriched on biochar kämpfer et al 2009 sun et al 2021 cloacibacillus could syntrophically oxidize acetate to produce h2 co2 and is well associated with hydrogenotrophic methanogens to enhance methane production tsavkelova et al 2018 corresponding to the enrichment of cloacibacillus the enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanolinea 16 was also observed fig 6c and d previous studies have reported that acetoclastic methanogens are sensitive to omps while hydrogenotrophic methanogens are not affected by omps even at a high concentration of 10 mg l hu et al 2018 silva et al 2020 additionally methanogenesis was proven to play a vital role in the biotransformation of omps gonzalez gil et al 2018b thus the syntrophy between hydrogen donating syntrophs chryseobacterium and cloacibacillus and hydrogenotrophic archaea methanolinea may have largely contributed to the strengthened omp biotransformation 3 4 potential mechanism of biochar enhanced omp removal in the anmbr anmbr is superior to conventional anaerobic treatment technologies for omp removal zhang et al 2021 while recalcitrant omp still cannot be efficiently removed which weakens the advantages of this technology adding biochar to anmbr is an environmentally friendly and economically feasible strategy to indiscriminately strengthen the removal of different omps through rapid adsorption biochar decreases free omps in the mixed liquor once added fig s4 and a local high omp concentration was formed on the biochar compared with sorption the biotransformation of omp was much slow fig 4 and therefore mainly occurred after omp was adsorbed by biochar rather than in the mixed liquor moreover biotransformation efficiency rather than sorption removal efficiency was largely enhanced in the long term operated anmbr fig 3 and functional species are capable of directly degrading omps flavobacterium massilia etc or transferring the biologically active secondary metabolites acinetobacter and pseudomonas were acclimated and enriched on biochar fig 6 suggesting that biochar adsorption facilitates the biotransformation of omp based on this analysis adsorption biotransformation should be the primary pathway that biochar strengthens omp removal in the anmbr fig 7 the strength of biochar to omp biotransformation mainly because of i the strengthened syntrophic metabolism between hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanolinea and species that syntrophically oxidize acetate to h2 co2 chryseobacterium and cloacibacillus on biochar and ii high efficiency electron transfer between omp degradation species and acetoclastic methanogens facilitated by quinone hydroquinone groups these helped in acclimatizing the ch4 producing pathways under the stress of omp hence contributing to sustaining stable ch4 production and omp biotransformation 4 conclusions this study investigated the omp removal performance in an anmbr treating sewage and proposed adding biochar is a promising strategy to strengthen omp removal the main achievements of this study can be summarized as follows hydrophobic omps can be efficiently removed by anmbr through the synergy of biotransformation and sorption while the removal efficiency of hydrophilic omps is impacted by the functional groups in the chemical structure biochar addition largely enhanced the omp removal in anmbr in which adsorption biotransformation instead of adsorption was the primary pathway which ensured a stable enhancement performance during the long term operation strengthening the electron transfer activity by quinone hydroquinone groups and enriching specific species capable of degrading omps and syntrophic acetate oxidizing species that produce h2 co2 on biochar jointly contribute to strengthening omp biotransformation and sustaining stable ch4 production declaration of competing interest the

15569,the removal of emerging organic micropollutants omps in anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs has garnered considerable attention owing to the rapid development of anmbr technology and the increased environmental risk caused by omp discharge we investigated the removal efficiency of 22 typical omps from sewage being treated in an anmbr and implemented and evaluated an upgrading strategy by adding biochar the average removal efficiency of omps was only 76 8 due to hydrophilic omps containing electron withdrawing groups ketoprofen ibuprofen diclofenac and carbamazepine being poorly removed biochar addition 5 0 g l promoted the removal of recalcitrant omps by 45 leading to an enhanced removal efficiency of 88 7 although biochar has a high adsorption capacity to different omps the biotransformation rather than sorption removal efficiency of 13 of the 22 omps was largely enhanced suggesting that adsorption biotransformation was the main approach by which biochar enhances the omp removal biotransformation test and microbial analysis revealed that the enrichment of species flavobacterium massilia acinetobacter and cloacibacterium involved in omp biotransformation on biochar contributed largely to the enhanced biotransformation removal efficiency of omps in this way the enhanced electron transfer activity and syntrophic metabolism between hydrogenotrophic methanogens and species that oxidize acetate to h2 co2 on biochar jointly contributed to the stable ch4 production and omp biotransformation this study provides a promising strategy to enhance the omp removal in anmbrs and improves our understanding of the underlying mechanism of biochar amended omp removal in anaerobic treatment systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords organic

the removal of organic micropollutants omps in wastewater treatment systems clara et al 2005 melvin and leusch 2016 radjenovic et al 2009 compared with aerobic mbrs anaerobic mbrs anmbrs operating under anaerobic conditions consume lower energy and can produce renewable energy hu et al 2020 and provide a promising alternative to aerobic mbrs considering the requirement of sustainable wastewater treatment kong et al 2021 the removal efficiency of some omps such as caffeine clozapine and triclocarban tcc in anmbrs is comparable to that in aerobic mbrs zhang et al 2021 however anmbrs are still inferior to aerobic mbrs in terms of omps removal some recalcitrant omps such as ketoprofen kp bisphenol a bpa and ibuprofen ibp that have low biotransformation rates under anaerobic conditions cannot be efficiently removed by anmbrs liu et al 2020 therefore anmbrs face more challenges than aerobic mbrs rysz et al 2013 suarez et al 2010 thus strengthening strategies to enhance omp removal in anmbrs has garnered the interest of experts in this field incorporating additives and bio electrochemical strength are two effective methods to enhance omp removal in anaerobic treatment systems diehl and lapara 2010 dutta et al 2014 guo et al 2017 zhao et al 2020 considering the system configuration and operation cost incorporating additives is more promising when integrated with anmbrs various kinds of additives including granular activated carbon gac dutta et al 2014 powdery activated carbon pac xiao et al 2017 biochar jiang et al 2019 tang et al 2021 and fe3o4 zhao et al 2020 have been employed and evaluated in previous studies among them pac and gac were widely adopted considering their good adoptability based on the large specific area however removing omps by adding activated carbon relies heavily on the adsorption of activated carbon xiao et al 2017 leading to the regular replacement or continuous addition of activated carbon to sustain the removal performance in long term operations this results in an unavoidable increase in the operation cost recently unactivated biochar derived from agricultural waste through direct pyrolysis at a low temperature is reported to be a promising alternative for activated carbon in anaerobic treatment to enhance omp removal li et al 2020 the author found that gac and biochar have comparable promoting effects on the biotransformation of phenol during anaerobic digestion while the underlying mechanisms are different wang et al 2020 speculated that the redox based electron exchange capacity of biochar accelerated the syntrophic phenol oxidation for methanogenesis through direct interspecies electron transfer from the enrichment of geobacter and methanosaeta similar results are also reported in a subsequent study wherein biochar elevated the tetracycline removal efficiency by 24 158 by boosting the biotransformation pathway in swine manure digestion wang et al 2021 these studies demonstrated that adding biochar is a powerful strategy for enhancing omp removal in anaerobic treatment systems however the focus of these studies was on the impacts of biochar on anaerobic digestion rather than omp removal the syntrophy between bacteria and archaea was over stressed while the specific microbes involved in omp degradation were not comprehensively analyzed moreover these studies were conducted on a short term basis with the addition of only one omp the achievements relevant to omp removal are specific and cannot be generalized for omps with different properties gonzalez gil et al 2018a this work aimed to study the enhancement of biochar addition to omp removal in anmbr treating sewage the specific objectives were to i investigate the impact of chemical structure and hydrophobicity on the omp removal efficiency in an anaerobic treatment system ii analyze the omp removal pathways and the strengthen of biochar to the sorption and biodegradation behaviors of omp with different chemical structures and hydrophobicity iii unravel the enhancement pathways of biochar to omp removal the results provide valuable information for omp removal in anmbr and illustrate that adding biochar is a promising approach to strengthening omp removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 anmbr configuration and operating protocol a previously reported lab scale submerged anmbr has an operating volume of 6 0 l was employed in this study lei et al 2021b wherein two membrane modules assembled by hydrophilic modified polyvinylidene fluoride membrane pore size of 0 2 μm were installed fig s1 synthetic sewage containing a set of 22 typical omps was fed to the anmbr at a concentration of 2 0 μg l the chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen and total phosphorus of the influent were 500 0 50 0 and 5 0 mg l respectively the synthetic sewage compositions and omp physicochemical properties are provided in tables s1 and s2 hydraulic retention time hrt of the anmbr was set at 3 2 h in the experiment the anmbr was operated for over 60 days to reach a stable treatment performance cod removal of around 95 before experimental data collection subsequently the omp removal performance of the anmbr was investigated without and with biochar successively the mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss concentration excluding biochar in the anmbr was 9 0 1 5 g l and the srt calculated excluding the mass of biochar was kept at approximately 180 days corncob derived granular biochar prepared through one step pyrolysis at a low temperature 500 c was adopted with a dosage of 4 0 g l in this study the specific biochar preparation procedure refers to a previous study lei et al 2021a during the experiment sludge was discharged every two days to sustain a stable mlvss concentration biochar discharged from the anmbr was sieved and recycled to the reactor to avoid biochar loss 2 2 batch tests as two typical omp removal pathways in biological treatment systems sorption and biotransformation behaviors were tested to identify the sludge and biochar sorption capacity to different omps the biotransformation potential of different omps and the impact of biochar 2 2 1 batch tests for the solids sorption to different omps freeze dried sludge and biochar suspended liquids were prepared with mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentrations of 9 0 0 5 g l sludge and 4 0 g l biochar using milli q water respectively and have the same sludge and biochar concentrations to the anmbr 100 ml of suspended liquid was added to a 120 ml glass serum flask and the headspace was purged with nitrogen gas for 5 min to remove any oxygen 0 1 ml of omp stock solution was added into the serum flask by a syringe to reach an initial omp concentration of 100 μg l the sealed serum flasks were then incubated in a shaker 115 rpm 25 c the sorption test was conducted for 240 min and regularly sampled for the omp concentration analysis until sorption equilibrium was achieved the sorption capacities of the sludge and biochar to omps were calculated using a quasi second order kinetic model eq 1 1 q t k q e 2 t 1 k q e t where q e and q t are the sorption quantity at t time and sorption equilibrium respectively μg g t is the reaction duration h and k is the sorption rate constant 2 2 2 batch tests for the biotransformation potential of different omps sludge taken from the anmbr 120 ml omp stock solution and milli q water were added into brown glass serum flasks with a total volume of 220 ml the mlss and initial omp concentrations in the serum flasks were 9 0 0 5 g l and 100 μg l respectively the serum flasks were purged using pure nitrogen gas and sealed to reach an anaerobic condition and then placed in a bath shaker 25 c 115 rpm one blank sample without omp feeding was set to provide a reference for eliminating the interference of the omps sorption on the seed sludge concentrated synthetic sewage free omps was added to the serum flasks every 8 h to ensure biomass activity two duplicates were set for each sample n 3 omp concentrations in the aqueous and sludge phases were detected at 0 1 3 6 8 12 18 and 32 h omps removal in the batch

influent and effluent samples were collected every two days for omp analysis the omp concentration was determined by coupling solid phase extraction spe and ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms ms waters usa methods s1 and s2 omp content in the solid phase was collected four times on days 68 92 110 and 155 the samples were pretreated by a sequence of processes including washing freeze drying powdering and extraction based on the methods used in previous studies monsalvo et al 2014 wijekoon et al 2013 method s3 the uplc ms ms analysis parameters are listed in tables s3 and s4 to ensure the accuracy of the method quality assurance and quality control elements comprising field blank duplicates and recovery indicators for each set of samples the

laboratory limits of quantification loq which was 10 times of signal to noise ratio table s5 the biotransformation removal efficiency of different omps during the anmbr operation was calculated

taken every two days for cod analysis using a rapid digestion spectrophotometric method apha 2005 mlss and mlvss concentrations in the anmbr were measured weekly the conductivity of biochar was tested

of the biochar are listed in table 1 and fig s2 2 6 statistical analysis one factor variance analysis at a 5 significance level p 0 05 with a data difference of at least ten percentual points was employed to determine if the biochar addition has significant impacts on removal sorption and biotransformation efficiencies to identify species with a significant difference between biochar and sludge a permutation test was performed at a 5 significance level using the stamp software p 0 05 v 2 1 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 omp removal in the anmbr the cod removal efficiency of the anmbr was around 95 0 0 9 at hrt 3 2 h 0 40 d and biogas production reached 1 14 0 18 l l reactor d wherein the ch4 percentage was over 83 resulting in a high cod converted to methane rate over 82 fig s3 the average removal efficiency of the twenty two omps was 75 7 20 3 fig 1 and the removal efficiency of different omps varied in a wide range these omps were divided into hydrophobic log d 3 2 and hydrophilic log d 3 2 omps according to the standard log d value ph 7 0 extracted from the scifinder database all hydrophobic omps reached a high removal efficiency of over 80 much higher than the hydrophilic omps suggesting that hydrophobicity is a key factor for omp removal this is mainly because the hydrophobicity determines sludge sorption capacity to omps liu et al 2020 monsalvo et al 2014 wijekoon et al 2015 nevertheless the removal efficiency of hydrophilic omps does not strictly obey the hydrophobicity the values varied from 21 1 ibp to 96 9 trimethoprim tmp this may be caused by differences in chemical structure and functional groups of different omps the impacts of functional groups on removal efficiency showed that omps containing electron donating groups edgs reached a removal efficiency of over 70 regardless of the log d values in comparison the removal efficiency of omps containing electron withdrawing groups ewgs varied in a wide range from 27 2 to over 84 0 hydrophilic omps containing ewgs including kp ibp dcf and carbamazepine cbz had low removal efficiencies of 50 while hydrophobic omps containing ewgs including 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 tcs and 3 4 methylbenzyliden camphor mbc reached high removal efficiencies of over 80 these results are consistent with previous studies in which hydrophilic omps containing strong ewgs showed low removal efficiencies under anaerobic conditions chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 this is mainly because 1 hydrophilic compounds can be easily discharged from the anmbr in the effluent owing to a low absorption quantity and 2 the presence of ewgs in the chemical structure can generate an electron deficiency which makes the omp difficult to serve as an oxidizing agent zhang et al 2021 therefore necessary enhancement methods need to be implemented to strengthen the removal of hydrophilic omps containing ewgs notably all nine omps containing both electron withdrawing and electron donating groups ewdgs reached high removal efficiencies of over 80 regardless of the log d value suggesting that the co occurrence of dwgs and edgs facilitates omp removal sorption and biotransformation are two typical pathways for omp removal in biological treatment systems clara et al 2005 liu et al 2020 the sorption quantity of sludge to different omps varied in a wide range mainly because of the difference in log d values fig 2 a sludge sorption to omps with a log d of 3 2 including celestolide clt mbc tcs oxybenzone bp3 avobenzone avb and triclocarban tcc reached 320 660 ng g mlvss much higher than that of omps with a log d value 3 2 230 ng g mlvss except for atenolol ate and bp4 moreover the sorption removal efficiency has a significant positive linear correlation with log d p 0 01 fig 2a confirming that log d is an important factor that determines the omp removal through sorption biotransformation of omp is impacted by the log d and functional groups the presence of ewgs generally facilitates the reductive biotransformation of omp under anaerobic conditions alvarino et al 2018 wijekoon et al 2015 while the hydrophilic omps including dcf and cbz had a low biotransformation removal efficiency of 15 6 and 12 3 respectively this should be attributed to the presence of the chloro or amide groups in the chemical structure dutta et al 2014 song et al 2018 the other five omps containing ewgs achieved an average biotransformation efficiency of 28 9 6 5 which was slightly lower than that of omps containing edgs promotion of ewgs to omp biotransformation was not observed in this study biotransformation accounted for 84 1 12 2 of the total quantity of hydrophilic omps containing ewdgs leading to a low sorption removal efficiency of 4 2 3 0 possibly because the presence of ewdgs increased the biotransformation of omps however sorption was still the predominant pathway for the removal of hydrophobic omps containing ewdgs removal efficiency was 51 6 6 5 although the contribution of biotransformation cannot be overlooked removal efficiency was 30 4 7 3 this confirmed the significance of hydrophobicity in the removal of omps omp removal efficiency in this study is comparable to it reported in previous studies employing anmbr table s6 liu et al 2020 monsalvo et al 2014 wijekoon et al 2015 while the biotransformation efficiency of several omps including ate e3 kp tc and tt is much lower than it in aerobic mbrs gurung et al 2019 in addition ibp dcf cbz and kp have low efficiencies in anmbrs mainly because of their poor biodegradability at anaerobic condition grandclément et al 2017 therefore practicable strengthening strategies for the removal and biotransformation of these omps need to be developed and evaluated 3 2 biochar strengthened omp removal in the anmbr biochar was added into the anmbr on day 98 and no obvious impacts on the cod removal efficiency 95 1 0 6 and biogas production 1 14 0 18 l l reactor d were observed fig s3 while the removal efficiency of omps has a remarkable increase fig 3 the percentage of seven omps in the effluent showed a significant decrease p 0 05 data difference over ten percentual points which resulted in a large increase in the removal efficiency of omps from 75 7 20 3 to 89 4 6 0 especially for kp dcf ibp and cbz their removal efficiencies were improved by over 45 and average removal efficiency of 88 7 was achieved this efficiency is comparable to it in an anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor filled with commercial granular activated carbon with a high packing ratio 50 in the membrane tank dutta et al 2014 these results demonstrate that adding biochar with a low dosage is a commercial and practicable approach for enhancing omp removal performance when treating sewage using anmbr sorption is conventionally considered to play a primary role when typical carbon based materials were employed to enhance omp removal xu et al 2021 in this study although biochar prepared at a low temperature without activation results in a lower specific surface area than commercially activated carbon a sorption capacity of 160 420 μg g ss can be achieved for different omps fig s4 table s7 the sorption capacity is 40 80 times higher than that of the sludge flocs the high sorption of biochar to omps is conducive to improving omps removal efficiency which can also be demonstrated by the increased sorption removal efficiency of ate bp4 and tcc fig 3 the promotion of biochar to biotransformation is more worth being valued when compared with sorption biotransformation efficiency of thirteen omps was significantly enhanced after adding biochar p 0 05 data difference over ten percentual points fig 3 similar results were also reported in several previous studies table 2 xiao et al 2017 found that a low dosage of pac 1 0 g l enhanced the biotransformation of smx and tcs in a pac anmbr while it weakly impacted the biotransformation of cbz and dcf in another staged anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor safmbr using gac as the medium at a high packing ratio of 25 50 high efficiency omp removal was achieved regardless of the omp properties dutta et al 2014 lim et al 2019 the author suspected that adsorption to gac and biotransformation in the biofilm formed on the gac surface were the main removal pathways for omps however the mechanism of enhancing omp biotransformation through biochar seems not identical to activated carbon as strengthened biotransformation was also observed in a short term batch test fig 4 wherein the enrichment of specific microbes on biochar is faint as shown in fig 4 and table s8 the biotransformation potential of cbz kp ee2 tc and tcc were significantly enhanced p 0 05 these omps were classified into pharmaceuticals and hormones they may suppress microbial activities when present in the mixed liquor silva et al 2020 biochar adsorption to these omps helps prevent their adverse effects on microbes thereby strengthening omp biotransformation in addition the rmax of e3 kp cbz ee2 tcs smx npx and bp3 significantly increased with the addition of biochar p 0 05 fig 5 biochar accelerated the biochemical reaction rate of omps the electron transfer system activity of the sludge system was increased from 3 3 0 4 to 4 5 0 2 μg mg h p 0 05 with the addition of biochar owning to the promotion of quinone hydroquinone groups c o and co on biochar to electron transfer wang et al 2020 this is supposed to be the mechanism that biochar directly strengthens omp biotransformation 3 3 biochar enriched functional species that biotransforming omps biochar only strengthened the biotransformation of five omps significantly in the bath test while the biotransformation of thirteen omps was significantly strengthened in the anmbr with biochar added this demonstrates acclimating specific species capable of degrading omps on biochar played an important role for strengthening omp removal in the amended anmbr with biochar firmicutes 27 5 bacteroidetes 14 7 chloroflexi 8 74 acidobacteria 2 84 and proteobacteria 1 59 dominated the microbial community in the sludge abundance 1 0 fig s5 biochar showed little impact on the microbial community in sludge at the phylum level while it created a unique microflora on the biochar that differs from it in sludge the minority phylum in sludge including proteobacteria and synergistetes became the predominant on biochar and the abundance of firmicutes and bacteroidetes on biochar also showed obvious differences from those in sludge fig s5 at the genus level bacteria in sludge samples of anmbr and anmbr with biochar have similar species compositions with macellibacteroides proteocatella acetoanaerobium gp6 saccharofermentans and anaerovorax being predominant abundance 0 5 fig 6 a the microbial community in this system is distinct from that in our previous study when treating similar sewage without omps lei et al 2020 conventional fermenters and acid syntrophic acetate producers lost dominance in the system the predominance of these genera in the system may be associated with their potential resistance to omps for instance a high abundance of macellibacteroides 65 7 71 7 was reported in the treatment of wastewater containing oxytetracycline and the abundance was positively correlated with the oxytetracycline concentration he et al 2020 this genus can also provide fermentation functions to some extent in the anaerobic system rout et al 2017 proteocatella was reported to have proteolytic chitinolytic and amylolytic activities and was capable of producing acid or secreting hydrolase li et al 2018 saccharofermentans could use complex organic matter to produce acetate zheng et al 2018 and was reported to be enriched in an anaerobic digestion system containing high smx and norfloxacin concentrations acetoanaerobium and anaerovorax are both fermentation microorganisms that can convert protein putrescine glucose and amino acids to butyrate acetate hydrogen and carbon dioxide supaphol et al 2011 acetoanaerobium has a synergistic relationship with exoelectrogens in the degradation of complex organic matter liu et al 2016 anaerovorax was reported to be the main species when treating norfloxacin using anaerobic digestion and plays an important role in the biotransformation of omps zhu et al 2021 biochar addition largely promoted the enrichment of functional microbes that degrade omps fig 6b massilia and flavobacterium were significantly enriched on the biochar surface p 0 05 these species were reported as functional bacteria in the anaerobic biotransformation omps ke et al 2014 qin et al 2020 protecocatella gp6 and saccharofermentans reported as common fermenters were much lower than that on biochar surface p 0 05 massilia 17 3 flavobacterium 8 37 and macellibacteroides 3 55 are the predominant bacteria on biochar and several genera that are generally involved in omps transformation including cloacibacterium 1 85 acinetobacter 1 58 chryseobacterium 1 19 pseudomonas 1 09 and cloacibacillus 0 81 were also identified with a relatively high abundance on biochar liu and pop 2009 ou et al 2016 romero fierro et al 2021 moreover chryseobacterium and cloacibacillus that could assimilate acetate were also enriched on biochar kämpfer et al 2009 sun et al 2021 cloacibacillus could syntrophically oxidize acetate to produce h2 co2 and is well associated with hydrogenotrophic methanogens to enhance methane production tsavkelova et al 2018 corresponding to the enrichment of cloacibacillus the enrichment of hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanolinea 16 was also observed fig 6c and d previous studies have reported that acetoclastic methanogens are sensitive to omps while hydrogenotrophic methanogens are not affected by omps even at a high concentration of 10 mg l hu et al 2018 silva et al 2020 additionally methanogenesis was proven to play a vital role in the biotransformation of omps gonzalez gil et al 2018b thus the syntrophy between hydrogen donating syntrophs chryseobacterium and cloacibacillus and hydrogenotrophic archaea methanolinea may have largely contributed to the strengthened omp biotransformation 3 4 potential mechanism of biochar enhanced omp removal in the anmbr anmbr is superior to conventional anaerobic treatment technologies for omp removal zhang et al 2021 while recalcitrant omp still cannot be efficiently removed which weakens the advantages of this technology adding biochar to anmbr is an environmentally friendly and economically feasible strategy to indiscriminately strengthen the removal of different omps through rapid adsorption biochar decreases free omps in the mixed liquor once added fig s4 and a local high omp concentration was formed on the biochar compared with sorption the biotransformation of omp was much slow fig 4 and therefore mainly occurred after omp was adsorbed by biochar rather than in the mixed liquor moreover biotransformation efficiency rather than sorption removal efficiency was largely enhanced in the long term operated anmbr fig 3 and functional species are capable of directly degrading omps flavobacterium massilia etc or transferring the biologically active secondary metabolites acinetobacter and pseudomonas were acclimated and enriched on biochar fig 6 suggesting that biochar adsorption facilitates the biotransformation of omp based on this analysis adsorption biotransformation should be the primary pathway that biochar strengthens omp removal in the anmbr fig 7 the strength of biochar to omp biotransformation mainly because of i the strengthened syntrophic metabolism between hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanolinea and species that syntrophically oxidize acetate to h2 co2 chryseobacterium and cloacibacillus on biochar and ii high efficiency electron transfer between omp degradation species and acetoclastic methanogens facilitated by quinone hydroquinone groups these helped in acclimatizing the ch4 producing pathways under the stress of omp hence contributing to sustaining stable ch4 production and omp biotransformation 4 conclusions this study investigated the omp removal performance in an anmbr treating sewage and proposed adding biochar is a promising strategy to strengthen omp removal the main achievements of this study can be summarized as follows hydrophobic omps can be efficiently removed by anmbr through the synergy of biotransformation and sorption while the removal efficiency of hydrophilic omps is impacted by the functional groups in the chemical structure biochar addition largely enhanced the omp removal in anmbr in which adsorption biotransformation instead of adsorption was the primary pathway which ensured a stable enhancement performance during the long term operation strengthening the electron transfer activity by quinone hydroquinone groups and enriching specific species capable of degrading omps and syntrophic acetate oxidizing species that produce h2 co2 on biochar jointly contribute to strengthening omp biotransformation and sustaining stable ch4 production declaration of competing interest the
