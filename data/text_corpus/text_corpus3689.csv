18445,two submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs with and without powdered activated carbon pac were studied to revisit the effect of pac on membrane fouling performance by long term operation when treating synthetic sewage the results showed that pac remained efficient for membrane fouling control after long term operation over 140 d and it reduced the fouling rate at a hydraulic retention time of 8 h from 3 12 to 0 89 kpa d pac mainly mitigated the membrane fouling by restraining the formation of a cake layer while generating a gel layer on the membrane surface which was attributed to the pac induced microbial community change in mixed liquor and the membrane surface microbial community analysis indicated the genera pseudomonas 26 5 and methanothrix 79 21 were the predominant bacteria and archaea respectively in the gel layer and this result is completely different from the presence of a high abundance of levilinea 7 1 aminivibrio 4 9 and methanothrix 90 04 in the cake layer on the membrane surface without pac the significant difference in the predominant microbes in the membrane surface layer was attributed to the reduced enrichment of levilinea and methanothrix with pac addition graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic membrane bioreactor powdered activated carbon membrane fouling cake layer gel fouling 1 introduction anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs have been studied by many researchers as a reliable and promising technology for wastewater treatment because of their high bioenergy recovery potential and reclamation applications song et al 2018 by combining anaerobic digestion with a membrane separation process anmbrs decouple the biomass retention of the slow growth methanogens from the shortened hydraulic retention time hrt greatly promoting the application of anaerobic digestion technology in sewage treatment liu et al 2013 however membrane fouling remains an inevitable barrier increasing energy demand and hindering the application of anmbrs especially for the mainstream process in sewage treatment chen et al 2017a hu et al 2016 neoh et al 2016 membrane fouling is caused by complex physical chemical and even biological interactions between the foulants including organics colloids cells sludge flocs and salts and the membrane surface lin et al 2014 wang et al 2013 causing decreased flux and increased operation cost bagheri and mirbagheri 2018 to date scouring agents in anmbrs have been used as an energy efficient approach to control membrane fouling by efficiently reducing fouling while consuming less energy meng et al 2017 among different additives powdered activated carbon pac is the most popular choice generally adding pac has many benefits for fouling control including adsorption of the foulants and their subsequent biodegradation aun ng et al 2006 zhang et al 2017 increasing critical flux remy et al 2010 improving the strength of microbial flocs lin et al 2011 remy et al 2010 skouteris et al 2015 and enhancing scouring of particles on the membrane surface johir et al 2011 in addition pac also provides a solid support for bacterial growth protecting the sludge flocs from breakage under violent shear hu and stuckey 2007 li et al 2018 previous studies usually examined a short operation period or batch test akram and stuckey 2008 zhang et al 2017 and had a greater focus on the short term effect of pac in contrast difference between the fouled membrane with pac and without pac were observed in a long term study almost 100 d and the difference was attributed to the high back transport velocity of pac akram and stuckey 2008 furthermore a few studies mentioned the effect of pac on the microbial community in anmbrs under long term operation and of the microbe induced biofouling by enriching some specific microbes on the membrane surface aslam et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 under long term operation pac in the reactor will become saturated and no longer adsorb the foulants especially extracellular polymeric substances and soluble microbial products with a high molecular weight in mixed liquor hence the particles scouring function on the membrane surface and the microbial community in the hybrid reactor will become the main factors impacting membrane fouling aslam et al 2017 johir et al 2011 unfortunately the scouring by pac on the membrane surface is very feeble because of its small size especially for the adherent gelatinous materials on membrane surface remy et al 2010 thus the microbe induced biofouling is a key factor impacting the membrane fouling under this condition although several studies have demonstrated that adding activated carbon greatly affects the microbial community in mixed liquor poirier et al 2018 yu et al 2019 and while pac results in microbial community changes on the membrane surface little is known regarding the mitigation mechanism of biofouling the objectives of this study are to study the effect of pac on membrane fouling performance in anmbrs especially the bio effect on membrane fouling under long term operation and to revisit the effect of pac on mixed liquor characteristics membrane fouling foulant components and the characteristics of the microbial characteristics in mixed liquor and on the membrane surface to achieve these objectives digestion performance mixed liquor properties membrane performance foulants analysis as well as the microbial community in mixed liquor and on the membrane surfaces were studied the reexamination results in this study provide new insight into the effect of pac on membrane fouling control 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up and operation two anmbrs with an working volume of 2 l total volume of 5 l were operated at 25 1 c using a water bath controlling the temperature fig 1 a flat sheet membrane module with an effective filtration area of 0 036 m2 was equipped inside each reactor and the membrane used in this study was made of chlorinated polyethylene with a nominal pore size of 0 2 Î¼m the produced biogas was continuously recirculated by a gas pump vby7506 cheehie china with a flow rate of 4 5 l min which corresponds to a high specific scouring demand of 7 5 m3 m2 h to control membrane fouling through a bubble diffuser equipped at the bottom of the reactor permeate was extracted by applying negative pressure to the permeate side of the membrane with a peristaltic pump bt100j 1a huiyu china transmembrane pressure tmp was monitored on line by a pressure transducer sinomeasure china installed between the membrane and the permeate pump a gas meter lmf 1 wale china was used to measure biogas production a schematic graph of the anmbr and the experimental setup are shown in fig 1 the two anmbrs were inoculated with anaerobic sludge from a brewery wastewater treatment plant in xi an china and the initial sludge concentrations were identical pac was added in one reactor named p anmbr with a dosage of 4 5 g l and the other reactor without the pac added named c anmbr throughout the experiment pac was not replenished because of the aiming to investigate the long term effect of pac addition on the anmbr system the main characteristics of the synthetic sewage were as follows the total chemical oxygen demand cod was 500 50 mg l ammonia nitrogen was 40 5 mg l total phosphorus was 5 0 0 5 mg l and no suspended solid was added the details of the components and their concentrations are presented in the supplementary materials table s2 after inoculation the two reactors were operated at hrt 36 h for 6 d then hrt was shortened to 24 h and data were collected five hrts 24 h 16 h 12 h 8 h and 6 h were set by adjusting the suction cycle of the permeate pump and the corresponding fluxes were 2 31 3 47 4 63 6 94 and 9 26 l m2 h respectively no excess sludge was regularly discharged except for periodical sampling for analysis mainly due to the low mixed liquor volatile suspended solids yields chen et al 2017b and the solids retention time is calculated as approximately 800 days 2 2 ex situ filtration tests for the fouled membranes membrane cleaning and filtration tests were performed to identify the membrane resistance distribution in this process water naclo solution 0 1 and citric acid solution 10 g l were used to clean the membrane surface layer organics and inorganics successively after each cleaning process a filtration test was performed in deionized water and repeated three times then the resistance was calculated based on the darcy equation the detailed cleaning process and resistance calculating method were recorded in a previous study chen et al 2017b 2 3 morphology analysis of layer on membrane surface and microbes in mixed liquor scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive spectrometry edx were performed on membranes taken from anmbrs to observe and compare the morphologies and elemental compositions membranes taken from the reactors were open air dried coated with a platinum alloy observed using sem mla650f fei usa and characterized elementally using an edx analyzer octane plus edax usa the microbes in the two anmbrs were examined using a digital microscope eclipse 50i nikon japan at the same operational period day 150 to identify the different morphologies between them 2 4 component analysis of layer on the membrane surface for membrane surface layer analysis the membrane module was taken from the reactor and the surface layer was scrubbed with a brush then the detached layer was used for subsequent analysis soluble materials in the layer were extracted by centrifuging the suspension at 3 000 rad min for 10 min and the supernatant was considered the soluble materials cation exchange resin was added to another part of the suspended liquor with slightly stirring to dissolve the gelatinous materials then the sample was also centrifuged at 3 000 rad min for 10 min and the supernatant was the combination of gelatinous and soluble materials 2 5 dna extraction and high throughput sequencing analysis for dna extraction sludge samples collected from mixed liquor and membrane layer at the membrane changed time hrt 6 h were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min and then washed with a phosphate buffer solution three times via resuspension and centrifugation dna extraction was performed using the powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio usa as per the instructions and the quality and quantity of the extracted dna were assessed via agarose gel electrophoresis the polymerase chain reaction targeting 16 s rrna genes was performed followed by dna extraction in region v3 v4 primers 341f cctacgggnggcwgcag and 805r gactachvgggtatctaatcc were chosen as the detective dna sequences for all bacteria including archaebacteria zhang et al 2018 2019 the primers a349f gygcascagkcgmgaaw and a806r ggactacvsgggtatctaat was taken to identify the detail community composition of archaea chen et al 2017c after amplification dna products were separated and purified then the amplicon was used for sequencing on an illumina miseq platform by sangon biotech co shanghai china the obtained sequence fragments were assembled using pear software version 0 9 6 with the maximum allowable mismatch ratio of 0 1 for overlap region of stitching sequence after removing chimera sequences the obtained sequences were clustered into operation taxonomic units otus using mothur version 1 30 1 with a similarity 97 from the cluster file rarefaction curves at a similarity of 97 chao 1 richness estimator shannon diversity index and the good s coverage were generated for each sample using mothur finally taxonomic classification was performed by applying the ribosomal database project rdp classifier and alignment at a confidence threshold of 0 8 yin et al 2019 2 6 other analytical methods the influent and effluent cod were detected every 3 d the percentage of ch4 co2 n2 and h2 values in the generated biogas were measured by a gas chromatograph techcomp mg 7900 china the concentration of dissolved methane in the effluent was determined by the headspace technique according to a previous study hatamoto et al 2010 and all the measurements of the biogas amount were normalized to a standard state 0 c 1 atm proteins and carbohydrates concentrations in soluble and colloidal form were assayed according to the lowry method lowry et al 1951 and the phenol sulfuric acid method nielsen 2010 particle size distribution psd of mixed liquor was analyzed using a laser granularity distribution analyzer ls 230 svm beckman coulter usa with a detection range of 0 2000 Î¼m the zeta potential of mixed liquor was performed with a zeta potential meter zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk size exclusion chromatography was performed to identify the molecular weight mw distribution of influent and membrane surface foulants by high performance liquid chromatography method recorded in a previous study hu et al 2017 brunauer emmett teller bet analysis was performed to identify the adsorption constant of particles which was used to represent the adsorption capacity details about the bet sample preparation and analysis were provided in the supplementary materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term operation performance during over 180 days of operation effluent cod of the two reactors were lower than 35 mg l throughout resulting in the cod removal of both reactors being higher than 92 fig 2 a and b the effluent cod concentrations of c anmbr and p anmbr averaged 25 5 and 24 6 mg l respectively indicating that little difference was observed based on the effluent biogas yield fig 2c results inferred that a cod to methane conversion efficiency of over 85 was obtained at hrt 6 h corresponding to a methane yield of 0 30 l ch4 g cod when the dissolved methane is considered and a high quality of biogas 83 proportion of ch4 in biogas were achieved under stable operation fig 2d these results demonstrate that adding pac has almost no significantly improved effect on digestion performance in this study which differs from a previous study where an increase of over 20 of cod removal efficiency was observed when pac was added hu and stuckey 2007 this difference may be because only an easily biodegradable and soluble substrate was fed 3 2 particle size and morphology at the beginning of the experiment the psds with and without pac were almost identical and both had a median diameter of 20 66 Î¼m fig 3 a1 during the experiment there was no significant change of the sludge median diameter in the c anmbr while it in the p anmbr firstly decreased to 14 26 Î¼m and then slightly increased with the median diameter around 17 00 Î¼m fig 3a this result differs from the previous studies that show adding pac resulted in an increase of sludge size because of a decreased energy barrier li et al 2005 remy et al 2010 yu et al 2019 and hence increased sludge filterability in contrast the same results as presented in this study were reported by akram and stuckey 2008 who used a similar configuration and similar operation parameters to this study thus the effect of pac on psd is case specific which depends on the system configuration scouring rate and other operation conditions akram and stuckey 2008 hu and stuckey 2007 yu et al 2019 to provide better understanding of the psd difference microscope observation was performed the results show that many large microbial aggregates were observed in c anmbr fig 3b1 which is consistent with the results of the larger sludge particles in contrast masses of scattered filamentous microbes were observed in p anmbr indicating that pac induced the presence of free living filamentous microbes and hindered the formation of large microbial aggregates in mixed liquor furthermore the zeta potential of the mixed liquor in c anmbr and p anmbr was 24 1 1 5 mv and 28 0 1 4 mv respectively also demonstrating that adding pac decreases the particle size in the reactor because a lower zeta potential generally results in a smaller particle size deng et al 2014 ozgun et al 2015 3 3 membrane fouling performance 3 3 1 effect of pac on tmp as shown in fig 4 the effect of adding pac on fouling control was very weak at the slow fouling stage when a new membrane was set while the effect showed excellent performance during the rapid fouling stage for instance before the first membrane was changed the membrane fouling rate dtmp dt in c anmbr and p anmbr was 0 038 and 0 032 kpa d respectively showing very little difference the results show that the fouling rate in p anmbr 0 127 kpa d was much lower 41 5 than that in c anmbr 0 217 kpa d during the rapid fouling stage hrt 12 h indicating that adding pac mainly alleviates the membrane fouling by decreasing the fouling rate at the rapid fouling stage furthermore tmp profiles show that the fouling rates with or without pac at the rapid fouling stage were 0 89 and 2 54 kpa d at hrt 8 h respectively indicating that adding pac is still efficient for fouling control at 8 h and a similar trend is also shown at hrt 6 h differing from this study lin et al 2011 retorted that adding pac significantly prolonged the duration of the slow fouling stage because membrane fouling in the slow fouling stage mainly comprises pore fouling caused by dissolved biopolymers and metal ions fresh pac can absorb the particles that cause the pore fouling while pac was saturated at hrt 6 h in this study its effect prolonged the duration of the slow fouling stage was very limited bet analysis demonstrated that the pac absorbability was exhausted at day 140 and the adsorption constants of particles in c anmbr and p anmbr were 1 32 and 1 29 respectively thus the effect of pac on membrane fouling mitigation mainly depends on the scouring and bio effect after day 140 3 3 2 membrane resistance distribution analysis to further our understanding of the mechanism of pac on membrane fouling control membrane cleaning and ex situ filtration tests were performed at different fouling stages to identify the membrane resistance for unsaturated membranes at the initial stage fig 5 a the total membrane resistance in p anmbr was 50 lower than in c anmbr and the main difference derived from the membrane surface resistance rc because a thinner membrane surface layer was consistent with the previous studies that showed adding pac was effective in mitigating the layer formation on the membrane surface akram and stuckey 2008 vyrides and stuckey 2009 zhang et al 2017 notably rc in p anmbr was still 20 lower than the rc in c anmbr for a fouled membrane after over 150 d of operation fig 5b photos of fouled membranes show that much black sludge was observed in c anmbr while a visible gel layer was present on the surface of the membranes when pac was added indicating very different membrane surface layer compositions in the two reactors we suspect that this difference may be correlated to the bio effect of pac on membrane fouling moreover the pore resistance from inorganics rp inorg was much higher in p anmbr than in c anmbr mainly because of the presence of many scattered filamentous microbes in p anmbr fig 3b2 and pac adhered onto the membrane surface as a potential membrane foulant under high flux iversen et al 2009 ying and ping 2006 the adhesion is shown in a photo and the sem edx analysis results of a clean membrane supplementary fig s3 3 3 3 morphology and components of the membrane surface sem edx analysis was performed to reveal the layer morphology and components on the membrane surface for the fouled membranes in c anmbr and p anmbr the rough membrane surface of c anmbr is depicted in fig 6 a showing that biosolids are the main foulant which is consistent with the photo in fig 5 in contrast a smooth surface was observed when pac was added fig 6b and the smooth surface may be because gelatinous materials were the main foulant on the membrane surface and formed a gel layer results of edx analysis showed that the inorganic foulants correlated with the formation of gelatinous materials comprising ca al fe and mg and that the concentrations of gelatinous materials were much higher on fouled membranes in p anmbr than in c anmbr table 1 demonstrated that a gel layer rather than a cake layer formed on the membrane surface when pac was added in addition considering few si content in the seed sludge and feeding influent the higher abundance of si detected on layer of p anmbr than c anmbr should be attributed to the presence of pac particles on the membrane surface of p anmbr fig s3c in order to further understand the differences between the membrane surface layers the layers were characterized and quantified for proteins and carbohydrates as shown in fig 7 a the proteins existed in a gelatinous form 0 04 g m2 and the content on the fouled membrane of c anmbr was much lower than that of p anmbr 0 48 g m2 while the carbohydrates content was almost identical as for soluble materials both the proteins and carbohydrates contents on the membrane of c anmbr and the membrane of p anmbr were almost equal fig 7b the higher proteins concentration on the membrane surface in p anmbr may be because of the high back transport of sludge particles on the membrane surface due to higher shear to further investigate the molecular characteristics of the organics in surface layer mw distribution was analysis using size exclusion chromatography the result shows that the response intensity near the retention time at 6 min was significantly higher in total than soluble materials and this result is consistent with the content analysis results that show more gelatinous proteins existed on the membrane surface in p anmbr furthermore the retention time also indicates that the materials observed after close to 6 min originated from extracellular polymeric substances of microbes fig 7d rather than the substrate or utilizing associated products when compared with the mw distribution of the substrate fig s2 provided in supplementary materials thus we confirmed that this phenomenon was induced by the bio effect of pac on microbes in the reactors and that microbial composition analysis is necessary for further study 3 4 microbial community the microbes in the entire microbial community were established based on the 16s rrna gene sequence considering all samples from two reactors amplicon sequencing of the microbial community yielded 73954 7719 sequences on average after removal of singletons and normalization the finally acquired otus for bacteria and archaea was 1083 125 otus and 264 51 otus per sample respectively with the coverage value over 0 97 in each sample table s3 in supplementary materials in addition rarefaction curves tend to be leveled off when the reads sequences over 60000 meaning that only a few new bacterial phylotypes were detected with the increasing reads sequences demonstrating sufficient reads sequences were collected for microbial analysis taxonomy results indicated that over 85 of the otus of bacteria were classified at the phylum level showing that the majority of the microorganisms found in both reactors could be identified at the phylum level the microbial community mainly consisted of firmicutes 20 02 chloroflexi 15 26 bacteroidetes 14 04 synergistetes 13 98 proteobacteria 5 48 and euryarchaeota 5 35 at the phylum level in the mixed liquor of c anmbr fig 8 a according to previous studies firmicutes bacteroidetes and proteobacteria were reported to be ubiquitous in anaerobic reactors because of their ability to degrade a wide range of organics dodsworth et al 2013 venkiteshwaran et al 2015 in contrast although chloroflexi 20 22 firmicutes 15 09 bacteroidetes 11 95 proteobacteria 9 89 and synergistetes 6 35 remained predominant in the mixed liquor of p anmbr fig 8a their concentrations changed greatly furthermore the phylum aminicenantes also called cadadiate op8 presented in p anmbr with an abundance of 13 34 which is much higher than that in c anmbr 2 42 indicating that adding pac results in a significant change of the microbial community in mixed liquor similar trend was also observed with a lower euryarchaeota 4 15 in mixed liquor in p anmbr for microbes in the layer of the fouled membrane chloroflexi 17 38 bacteroidetes 14 62 firmicutes 11 87 proteobacteria 11 14 synergistetes 7 92 parcubacteria 6 77 and euryarchaeota 5 07 were predominant in c anmbr fig 8b exhibiting high similarity in classification and abundance with those in the mixed liquor fig s5a the predominance of parcubacteria in the layer of c anmbr indicates its high membrane fouling tendency because its abundance in the mixed liquor is very low 0 45 the venn diagram at the phylum level reveals that microbes in the mixed liquor and the layer of c anmbr shared 641 otus accounting for 37 4 of the total otus fig 9 a this result demonstrates that the microbes in the membrane surface and mixed liquor have high homology and that microbes in the layer are closely correlated to the microbial composition in the mixed liquor which is consistent with previous studies ding et al 2016 gao et al 2010 ma et al 2013 moreover the venn diagram of the predominant phyla shows that proteobacteria and synergistetes preferred the mixed liquor while more otu classified to bacteroidetes was observed in the membrane surface fig s6 these results confirm that bacteroidetes usually were the predominant microbes in membrane fouling ding et al 2016 gao et al 2010 ma et al 2013 as same with c anmbr chloroflexi and firmicutes in the mixed liquor and the layer on the membrane surface of p anmbr also shared high total otus almost 40 indicating they are also important contributors to membrane fouling for microbes in the p anmbr layer proteobacteria 38 30 parcubacteria 18 01 firmicutes 8 86 aminicenantes 5 88 and bacteroidetes 5 3 were predominant fig 8b however these abundances are different from those in the p anmbr layer by comparing with the dominant phylum in the mixed liquor of p anmbr the predominance of parcubacteria and aminicenantes in the layer shows a high membrane fouling correlation the venn diagram at the phylum level indicates 500 otus accounting for 33 8 of the total otus were shared between microbes in the mixed liquor and the layer of p anmbr showing lower homology than that in the layer of c anmbr 37 4 the venn diagram results indicate that adding pac has an effect on the enrichment of microbes on the membrane surface fig s6 dendrogram at the genus level also showed a higher similarity of bacteria between the mixed liquor and surface layer of c anmbr than p anmbr fig 9 genera levilinea 7 17 parcubacteria genera incertae sedis 6 77 aminivibrio 4 92 ornatilinea 3 81 paludibacter 2 39 and trichococcus 2 38 were the predominant bacteria in the layer of c anmbr and this result is consistent with previous studies that indicate the predominant bacteria in the layer are from the phyla chloroflexi bacteroidetes firmicutes proteobacteria synergistetes and parcubacteria gao et al 2010 ma et al 2013 by comparing the bacteria in the mixed liquor and the layer on the membrane surface the predominance of aminivibrio levilinea and ornatilinea originated from their high abundance in bulk sludge while the predominance of parcubacteria genera incertae sedis trichococcus and paludibacter may be attributed to the enrichment of these genera on the membrane surface because a low abundance was observed in the mixed liquor as for p anmbr genera pseudomonas 26 48 parcubacteria genera incertae sedis 18 01 and aminicenantes genera incertae sedis 5 88 were the predominant bacteria in the layer and this result is completely different from that in c anmbr indicating that adding pac highly impacted the microbial community and composition on the membrane surface by comparing the predominant bacteria in mixed liquor and the layer on the membrane surface of p anmbr genera pseudomonas and parcubacteria genera incertae sedis showed much higher abundance in the layer than in the mixed liquor meaning that they tend to be enriched on the membrane surface under this condition in contrast levilinea showed the opposite result because a higher abundance was observed in mixed liquor the difference of predominant bacteria between mixed liquor and those on the layer on the membrane surface in c anmbr and p anmbr indicates that adding pac greatly changes the enrichment of pseudomonas and levilinea on the membrane surface archaea classified to methanothrix 64 18 methanosphaerula 16 73 and methanomethylovorans 10 34 were predominant in mixed liquor of c anmbr and very little difference between that in c anmbr and p anmbr shown in fig 10 in comparison though methanosphaerula and methanomethylovorans were also predominant on the membrane layer of p anmbr the abundance of methanothrix in the gel layer of p anmbr 79 20 is much lower than that in the cake layer of c anmbr 90 04 suggesting pac greatly mitigated the enrichment of methanothrix on membrane surface based on the analysis of microbial community in mixed liquor and surface layer of membrane in the two reactors pac showed efficient mitigation of the enrichment of levilinea and methanothrix on membrane surface this may be the key path that pac mitigating membrane fouling under long term operation because the both levilinea and methanothrix belong to filamentous microbes which were reported to play a key role in the fouling process zhou et al 2016 2019 4 conclusions this study revisited the effect of pac on membrane fouling in an anmbr treating synthetic sewage the results indicate that adding pac in an anmbr alleviates membrane fouling after long term operation pac tends to prevent the combination of filamentous microbes with organics to form large size microbial aggregates in mixed liquor filtration tests and images of fouled membranes indicate that suppressing cake layer formation while slightly increasing the gel layer is the main reason why adding pac mitigates membrane fouling furthermore microbial analysis indicates that adding pac results in a completely different microbial community by adhering on the membrane these greatly impact the enrichment of microbes on membrane surface making pseudomonas rather than levilinea and methanothrix become the predominant microbes in a cake layer which is how pac mitigates membrane fouling under long term operation declaration of

18445,two submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs with and without powdered activated carbon pac were studied to revisit the effect of pac on membrane fouling performance by long term operation when treating synthetic sewage the results showed that pac remained efficient for membrane fouling control after long term operation over 140 d and it reduced the fouling rate at a hydraulic retention time of 8 h from 3 12 to 0 89 kpa d pac mainly mitigated the membrane fouling by restraining the formation of a cake layer while generating a gel layer on the membrane surface which was attributed to the pac induced microbial community change in mixed liquor and the membrane surface microbial community analysis indicated the genera pseudomonas 26 5 and methanothrix 79 21 were the predominant bacteria and archaea respectively in the gel layer and this result is completely different from the presence of a high abundance of levilinea 7 1 aminivibrio 4 9 and methanothrix 90 04 in the cake layer on the membrane surface without pac the significant difference in the predominant microbes in the membrane surface layer was attributed to the reduced enrichment of levilinea and methanothrix with pac addition graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic membrane bioreactor powdered activated carbon membrane fouling cake layer gel fouling 1 introduction anaerobic membrane

on the short term effect of pac in contrast difference between the fouled membrane with pac and without pac were observed in a long term study almost 100 d and the difference was attributed to the high back transport velocity of pac akram and stuckey 2008 furthermore a few studies mentioned the effect of pac on the microbial community in anmbrs under long term operation and of the microbe induced biofouling by enriching some specific microbes on the membrane surface aslam et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 under long term operation pac in the reactor will become saturated and no longer adsorb the foulants especially extracellular polymeric substances and soluble microbial products with a high molecular weight in mixed liquor hence the particles scouring function on the membrane surface and the microbial community in the hybrid reactor will become the main factors impacting membrane fouling aslam et al 2017 johir et al 2011 unfortunately the scouring by pac on the membrane surface is very feeble because of its small size especially for the adherent gelatinous materials on membrane surface remy et al 2010 thus the microbe induced biofouling is a key factor impacting the membrane fouling under this condition although several studies have demonstrated that adding activated carbon greatly affects the microbial community in mixed liquor poirier et al 2018 yu et al 2019 and while pac results in microbial community changes on the membrane surface little is known regarding the mitigation mechanism of biofouling the objectives of this study are to study the effect of pac on

of pac on membrane fouling control 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up and operation two anmbrs with an working volume of 2 l total volume of 5 l were operated at 25 1 c using a water bath controlling the temperature fig 1 a flat sheet membrane module with an effective filtration area of 0 036 m2 was equipped inside each reactor and the membrane used in this study was made of chlorinated polyethylene with a nominal pore size of 0 2 Î¼m the produced biogas was continuously recirculated by a gas pump vby7506 cheehie china with a flow rate of 4 5 l min which corresponds to a high specific scouring demand of 7 5 m3 m2 h to control membrane fouling through a bubble diffuser equipped at the bottom of the reactor permeate was extracted by applying negative pressure to the permeate side of the membrane with a peristaltic pump bt100j 1a huiyu china transmembrane pressure tmp was monitored on line by a pressure transducer sinomeasure china installed between the membrane and the permeate pump a gas meter lmf 1 wale china was used to measure biogas production a schematic graph of the anmbr and the experimental setup are shown in fig 1 the two anmbrs were inoculated with anaerobic sludge from a brewery wastewater treatment plant in xi an china and the initial sludge concentrations were identical pac was added in one reactor named p anmbr with a dosage of 4 5 g l and the other reactor without the pac added named c anmbr throughout the experiment pac was not replenished because of the aiming to investigate the long term effect of pac addition on the anmbr system the main characteristics of the synthetic sewage were as follows the total chemical oxygen demand cod was 500 50 mg l ammonia nitrogen was 40 5 mg l total phosphorus was 5 0 0 5 mg l and no suspended solid was added the details of the components and their concentrations are presented in the supplementary materials table s2 after inoculation the two reactors were operated at hrt 36 h for 6 d then hrt was shortened to 24 h and data were collected five hrts 24 h 16 h 12 h 8 h and 6 h were set by adjusting the suction cycle of the permeate pump and the corresponding fluxes were 2 31 3 47 4 63 6 94 and 9 26 l m2 h respectively no excess sludge was regularly discharged except for periodical sampling for analysis mainly due to the low mixed liquor volatile suspended solids yields chen et al 2017b and the solids retention time is calculated as approximately 800 days 2 2 ex situ filtration tests for the fouled membranes membrane cleaning and filtration tests were performed to identify the membrane resistance distribution in this process water naclo solution 0 1 and citric acid solution 10 g l were used to clean the membrane surface layer organics and inorganics successively after each cleaning process a filtration test was performed in deionized water and repeated three times then the resistance was calculated based on the darcy equation the detailed cleaning process and resistance calculating method were recorded in a previous study chen et al 2017b 2 3 morphology analysis of layer on membrane surface and microbes in mixed liquor scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive spectrometry edx were performed on membranes taken from anmbrs to observe and compare the morphologies and elemental compositions membranes taken from the reactors were open air dried coated with a platinum alloy observed using sem mla650f fei usa and characterized elementally using an edx analyzer octane plus edax usa the microbes in the two anmbrs were examined using a digital microscope eclipse 50i nikon japan at the same operational period day 150 to identify the different morphologies between them 2 4 component analysis of layer on the membrane surface for membrane surface layer analysis the membrane module was taken from the reactor and the surface layer was scrubbed with a brush then the detached layer was used for subsequent analysis soluble materials in the layer were extracted by centrifuging the suspension at 3 000 rad min for 10 min and the supernatant was considered the soluble materials cation exchange resin was added to another part of the suspended liquor with slightly stirring to dissolve the gelatinous materials then the sample was also centrifuged at 3 000 rad min for 10 min and the supernatant was the combination of gelatinous and soluble materials 2 5 dna extraction and high throughput sequencing analysis for dna extraction sludge samples collected from mixed liquor and membrane layer at the membrane changed time hrt 6 h were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min and then washed with a phosphate buffer solution three times via resuspension and centrifugation dna extraction was performed using the powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio usa as per the instructions and the quality and quantity of the extracted dna were assessed via agarose gel electrophoresis the polymerase chain reaction targeting 16 s rrna genes was performed followed by dna extraction in region v3 v4 primers 341f cctacgggnggcwgcag and 805r gactachvgggtatctaatcc were chosen as the detective dna sequences for all bacteria including archaebacteria zhang et al 2018 2019 the primers a349f gygcascagkcgmgaaw and a806r ggactacvsgggtatctaat was taken to identify the detail community composition of archaea chen et al 2017c after amplification dna products were separated and purified then the amplicon was used for sequencing on an illumina miseq platform by sangon biotech co shanghai china the obtained sequence fragments were assembled using pear software version 0 9 6 with the maximum allowable mismatch ratio of 0 1 for overlap region of stitching sequence after removing chimera sequences the obtained sequences were clustered into operation taxonomic units otus using mothur version 1 30 1 with a similarity 97 from the cluster file rarefaction curves at a similarity of 97 chao 1 richness estimator shannon diversity index and the good s coverage were generated for each sample using mothur finally taxonomic classification was performed by applying the ribosomal database project rdp classifier and alignment at a confidence threshold of 0 8 yin et al 2019 2 6 other analytical methods the influent and effluent cod were detected every 3 d the percentage of ch4 co2 n2 and h2 values in the generated biogas were measured by a gas chromatograph techcomp mg 7900 china the concentration of dissolved methane in the effluent was determined by the headspace technique according to a previous study hatamoto et al 2010 and all the measurements of the biogas amount were normalized to a standard state 0 c 1 atm proteins and carbohydrates concentrations in soluble and colloidal form were assayed according to the lowry method lowry et al 1951 and the phenol sulfuric acid method nielsen 2010 particle size distribution psd of mixed liquor was analyzed using a laser granularity distribution analyzer ls 230 svm beckman coulter usa with a detection range of 0 2000 Î¼m the zeta potential of mixed liquor was performed with a zeta potential meter zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk size exclusion chromatography was performed to identify the molecular weight mw distribution of influent and membrane surface foulants by high performance liquid chromatography method recorded in a previous study hu et al 2017 brunauer emmett teller bet analysis was performed to identify the adsorption constant of particles which was used to represent the adsorption capacity details about the bet sample preparation and analysis were provided in the supplementary materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term operation performance during over 180 days of operation effluent cod of the two reactors were lower than 35 mg l throughout resulting in the cod removal of both reactors being higher than 92 fig 2 a and b the effluent cod concentrations of c anmbr and p anmbr averaged 25 5 and 24 6 mg l respectively indicating that little difference was observed based on the effluent biogas yield fig 2c results inferred that a cod to methane conversion efficiency of over 85 was obtained at hrt 6 h corresponding to a methane yield of 0 30 l ch4 g cod when the dissolved methane is considered and a high quality of biogas 83 proportion of ch4 in biogas were achieved under stable operation fig 2d these results demonstrate that adding pac has almost no significantly improved effect on digestion performance in this study which differs from a previous study where an increase of over 20 of cod removal efficiency was observed when pac was added hu and stuckey 2007 this difference may be because only an easily biodegradable and soluble substrate was fed 3 2 particle size and morphology at the beginning of the experiment the psds with and without pac were almost identical and both had a median diameter of 20 66 Î¼m fig 3 a1 during the experiment there was no significant change of the sludge median diameter in the c anmbr while it in the p anmbr firstly decreased to 14 26 Î¼m and then slightly increased with the median diameter around 17 00 Î¼m fig 3a this result differs from the previous studies that show adding pac resulted in an increase of sludge size because of a decreased energy barrier li et al 2005 remy et al 2010 yu et al 2019 and hence increased sludge filterability in contrast the same results as presented in this study were reported by akram and stuckey 2008 who used a similar configuration and similar operation parameters to this study thus the effect of pac on psd is case specific which depends on the system configuration scouring rate and other operation conditions akram and stuckey 2008 hu and stuckey 2007 yu et al 2019 to provide better understanding of the psd difference microscope observation was performed the results show that many large microbial aggregates were observed in c anmbr fig 3b1 which is consistent with the results of the larger sludge particles in contrast masses of scattered filamentous microbes were observed in p anmbr indicating that pac induced the presence of free living filamentous microbes and hindered the formation of large microbial aggregates in mixed liquor furthermore the zeta potential of the mixed liquor in c anmbr and p anmbr was 24 1 1 5 mv and 28 0 1 4 mv respectively also demonstrating that adding pac decreases the particle size in the reactor because a lower zeta potential generally results in a smaller particle size deng et al 2014 ozgun et al 2015 3 3 membrane fouling performance 3 3 1 effect of pac on tmp as shown in fig 4 the effect of adding pac on fouling control was very weak at the slow fouling stage when a new membrane was set while the effect showed excellent performance during the rapid fouling stage for instance before the first membrane was changed the membrane fouling rate dtmp dt in c anmbr and p anmbr was 0 038 and 0 032 kpa d respectively showing very little difference the results show that the fouling rate in p anmbr 0 127 kpa d was much lower 41 5 than that in c anmbr 0 217 kpa d during the rapid fouling stage hrt 12 h indicating that adding pac mainly alleviates the membrane fouling by decreasing the fouling rate at the rapid fouling stage furthermore tmp profiles show that the fouling rates with or without pac at the rapid fouling stage were 0 89 and 2 54 kpa d at hrt 8 h respectively indicating that adding pac is still efficient for fouling control at 8 h and a similar trend is also shown at hrt 6 h differing from this study lin et al 2011 retorted that adding pac significantly prolonged the duration of the slow fouling stage because membrane fouling in the slow fouling stage mainly comprises pore fouling caused by dissolved biopolymers and metal ions fresh pac can absorb the particles that cause the pore fouling while pac was saturated at hrt 6 h in this study its effect prolonged the duration of the slow fouling stage was very limited bet analysis demonstrated that the pac absorbability was exhausted at day 140 and the adsorption constants of particles in c anmbr and p anmbr were 1 32 and 1 29 respectively thus the effect of pac on membrane fouling mitigation mainly depends on the scouring and bio effect after day 140 3 3 2 membrane resistance distribution analysis to further our understanding of the mechanism of pac on membrane fouling control membrane cleaning and ex situ filtration tests were performed at different fouling stages to identify the membrane resistance for unsaturated membranes at the initial stage fig 5 a the total membrane resistance in p anmbr was 50 lower than in c anmbr and the main difference derived from the membrane surface resistance rc because a thinner membrane surface layer was consistent with the previous studies that showed adding pac was effective in mitigating the layer formation on the membrane surface akram and stuckey 2008 vyrides and stuckey 2009 zhang et al 2017 notably rc in p anmbr was still 20 lower than the rc in c anmbr for a fouled membrane after over 150 d of operation fig 5b photos of fouled membranes show that much black sludge was observed in c anmbr while a visible gel layer was present on the surface of the membranes when pac was added indicating very different membrane surface layer compositions in the two reactors we suspect that this difference may be correlated to the bio effect of pac on membrane fouling moreover the pore resistance from inorganics rp inorg was much higher in p anmbr than in c anmbr mainly because of the presence of many scattered filamentous microbes in p anmbr fig 3b2 and pac adhered onto the membrane surface as a potential membrane foulant under high flux iversen et al 2009 ying and ping 2006 the adhesion is shown in a photo and the sem edx analysis results of a clean membrane supplementary fig s3 3 3 3 morphology and components of the membrane surface sem edx analysis was performed to reveal the layer morphology and components on the membrane surface for the fouled membranes in c anmbr and p anmbr the rough membrane surface of c anmbr is depicted in fig 6 a showing that biosolids are the main foulant which is consistent with the photo in fig 5 in contrast a smooth surface was observed when pac was added fig 6b and the smooth surface may be because gelatinous materials were the main foulant on the membrane surface and formed a gel layer results of edx analysis showed that the inorganic foulants correlated with the formation of gelatinous materials comprising ca al fe and mg and that the concentrations of gelatinous materials were much higher on fouled membranes in p anmbr than in c anmbr table 1 demonstrated that a gel layer rather than a cake layer formed on the membrane surface when pac was added in addition considering few si content in the seed sludge and feeding influent the higher abundance of si detected on layer of p anmbr than c anmbr should be attributed to the presence of pac particles on the membrane surface of p anmbr fig s3c in order to further understand the differences between the membrane surface layers the layers were characterized and quantified for proteins and carbohydrates as shown in fig 7 a the proteins existed in a gelatinous form 0 04 g m2 and the content on the fouled membrane of c anmbr was much lower than that of p anmbr 0 48 g m2 while the carbohydrates content was almost identical as for soluble materials both the proteins and carbohydrates contents on the membrane of c anmbr and the membrane of p anmbr were almost equal fig 7b the higher proteins concentration on the membrane surface in p anmbr may be because of the high back transport of sludge particles on the membrane surface due to higher shear to further investigate the molecular characteristics of the organics in surface layer mw distribution was analysis using size exclusion chromatography the result shows that the response intensity near the retention time at 6 min was significantly higher in total than soluble materials and this result is consistent with the content analysis results that show more gelatinous proteins existed on the membrane surface in p anmbr furthermore the retention time also indicates that the materials observed after close to 6 min originated from extracellular polymeric substances of microbes fig 7d rather than the substrate or utilizing associated products when compared with the mw distribution of the substrate fig s2 provided in supplementary materials thus we confirmed that this phenomenon was induced by the bio effect of pac on microbes in the reactors and that microbial composition analysis is necessary for further study 3 4 microbial community the microbes in the entire microbial community were established based on the 16s rrna gene sequence considering all samples from two reactors amplicon sequencing of the microbial community yielded 73954 7719 sequences on average after removal of singletons and normalization the finally acquired otus for bacteria and archaea was 1083 125 otus and 264 51 otus per sample respectively with the coverage value over 0 97 in each sample table s3 in supplementary materials in addition rarefaction curves tend to be leveled off when the reads sequences over 60000 meaning that only a few new bacterial phylotypes were detected with the increasing reads sequences demonstrating sufficient reads sequences were collected for microbial analysis taxonomy results indicated that over 85 of the otus of bacteria were classified at the phylum level showing that the majority of the microorganisms found in both reactors could be identified at the phylum level the microbial community mainly consisted of firmicutes 20 02 chloroflexi 15 26 bacteroidetes 14 04 synergistetes 13 98 proteobacteria 5 48 and euryarchaeota 5 35 at the phylum level in the mixed liquor of c anmbr fig 8 a according to previous studies firmicutes bacteroidetes and proteobacteria were reported to be ubiquitous in anaerobic reactors because of their ability to degrade a wide range of organics dodsworth et al 2013 venkiteshwaran et al 2015 in contrast although chloroflexi 20 22 firmicutes 15 09 bacteroidetes 11 95 proteobacteria 9 89 and synergistetes 6 35 remained predominant in the mixed liquor of p anmbr fig 8a their concentrations changed greatly furthermore the phylum aminicenantes also called cadadiate op8 presented in p anmbr with an abundance of 13 34 which is much higher than that in c anmbr 2 42 indicating that adding pac results in a significant change of the microbial community in mixed liquor similar trend was also observed with a lower euryarchaeota 4 15 in mixed liquor in p anmbr for microbes in the layer of the fouled membrane chloroflexi 17 38 bacteroidetes 14 62 firmicutes 11 87 proteobacteria 11 14 synergistetes 7 92 parcubacteria 6 77 and euryarchaeota 5 07 were predominant in c anmbr fig 8b exhibiting high similarity in classification and abundance with those in the mixed liquor fig s5a the predominance of parcubacteria in the layer of c anmbr indicates its high membrane fouling tendency because its abundance in the mixed liquor is very low 0 45 the venn diagram at the phylum level reveals that microbes in the mixed liquor and the layer of c anmbr shared 641 otus accounting for 37 4 of the total otus fig 9 a this result demonstrates that the microbes in the membrane surface and mixed liquor have high homology and that microbes in the layer are closely correlated to the microbial composition in the mixed liquor which is consistent with previous studies ding et al 2016 gao et al 2010 ma et al 2013 moreover the venn diagram of the predominant phyla shows that proteobacteria and synergistetes preferred the mixed liquor while more otu classified to bacteroidetes was observed in the membrane surface fig s6 these results confirm that bacteroidetes usually were the predominant microbes in membrane fouling ding et al 2016 gao et al 2010 ma et al 2013 as same with c anmbr chloroflexi and firmicutes in the mixed liquor and the layer on the membrane surface of p anmbr also shared high total otus almost 40 indicating they are also important contributors to membrane fouling for microbes in the p anmbr layer proteobacteria 38 30 parcubacteria 18 01 firmicutes 8 86 aminicenantes 5 88 and bacteroidetes 5 3 were predominant fig 8b however these abundances are different from those in the p anmbr layer by comparing with the dominant phylum in the mixed liquor of p anmbr the predominance of parcubacteria and aminicenantes in the layer shows a high membrane fouling correlation the venn diagram at the phylum level indicates 500 otus accounting for 33 8 of the total otus were shared between microbes in the mixed liquor and the layer of p anmbr showing lower homology than that in the layer of c anmbr 37 4 the venn diagram results indicate that adding pac has an effect on the enrichment of microbes on the membrane surface fig s6 dendrogram at the genus level also showed a higher similarity of bacteria between the mixed liquor and surface layer of c anmbr than p anmbr fig 9 genera levilinea 7 17 parcubacteria genera incertae sedis 6 77 aminivibrio 4 92 ornatilinea 3 81 paludibacter 2 39 and trichococcus 2 38 were the predominant bacteria in the layer of c anmbr and this result is consistent with previous studies that indicate the predominant bacteria in the layer are from the phyla chloroflexi bacteroidetes firmicutes proteobacteria synergistetes and parcubacteria gao et al 2010 ma et al 2013 by comparing the bacteria in the mixed liquor and the layer on the membrane surface the predominance of aminivibrio levilinea and ornatilinea originated from their high abundance in bulk sludge while the predominance of parcubacteria genera incertae sedis trichococcus and paludibacter may be attributed to the enrichment of these genera on the membrane surface because a low abundance was observed in the mixed liquor as for p anmbr genera pseudomonas 26 48 parcubacteria genera incertae sedis 18 01 and aminicenantes genera incertae sedis 5 88 were the predominant bacteria in the layer and this result is completely different from that in c anmbr indicating that adding pac highly impacted the microbial community and composition on the membrane surface by comparing the predominant bacteria in mixed liquor and the layer on the membrane surface of p anmbr genera pseudomonas and parcubacteria genera incertae sedis showed much higher abundance in the layer than in the mixed liquor meaning that they tend to be enriched on the membrane surface under this condition in contrast levilinea showed the opposite result because a higher abundance was observed in mixed liquor the difference of predominant bacteria between mixed liquor and those on the layer on the membrane surface in c anmbr and p anmbr indicates that adding pac greatly changes the enrichment of pseudomonas and levilinea on the membrane surface archaea classified to methanothrix 64 18 methanosphaerula 16 73 and methanomethylovorans 10 34 were predominant in mixed liquor of c anmbr and very little difference between that in c anmbr and p anmbr shown in fig 10 in comparison though methanosphaerula and methanomethylovorans were also predominant on the membrane layer of p anmbr the abundance of methanothrix in the gel layer of p anmbr 79 20 is much lower than that in the cake layer of c anmbr 90 04 suggesting pac greatly mitigated the enrichment of methanothrix on membrane surface based on the analysis of microbial community in mixed liquor and surface layer of membrane in the two reactors pac showed efficient mitigation of the enrichment of levilinea and methanothrix on membrane surface this may be the key path that pac mitigating membrane fouling under long term operation because the both levilinea and methanothrix belong to filamentous microbes which were reported to play a key role in the fouling process zhou et al 2016 2019 4 conclusions this study revisited the effect of pac on membrane fouling in an anmbr treating synthetic sewage the results indicate that adding pac in an anmbr alleviates membrane fouling after long term operation pac tends to prevent the combination of filamentous microbes with organics to form large size microbial aggregates in mixed liquor filtration tests and images of fouled membranes indicate that suppressing cake layer formation while slightly increasing the gel layer is the main reason why adding pac mitigates membrane fouling furthermore microbial analysis indicates that adding pac results in a completely different microbial community by adhering on the membrane these greatly impact the enrichment of microbes on membrane surface making pseudomonas rather than levilinea and methanothrix become the predominant microbes in a cake layer which is how pac mitigates membrane fouling under long term operation declaration of

18446,fe ii uv chlorine was promoted as a pretreatment strategy for uf membrane to mitigate membrane fouling induced from different organic fractions this treatment could be an emerging alternative prior to uf process attributed to the coupled role of oxidation and coagulation to obtain a comprehensive understanding of fouling reduction the influence of fe ii uv chlorine process on the characteristics of various feed solutions was inspected including humic acid ha bovine serum albumin bsa sodium alginate sa and their mixture hsb the results suggested that fe ii uv chlorine process exhibited notable performance on membrane fouling control compared to fe ii coagulation alone with the uv exposure of 720 mj cm2 the certain dose of fe ii and chlorine 15 Î¼m and 2 mg l effectively prevented the rapid development of fouling caused by the single organic fractions and their mixture and the increased dosage promoted the performance of membrane fouling mitigation the reduction of organic loadings and characteristics change of feed water took the main responsibility for the fouling alleviation the properties of membrane fouling and their correlation with feed water qualities were analyzed the results and insight analysis were supposed to evaluate and predict the effectiveness of fouling control when the feed solutions were pretreated by fe ii uv chlorine process according to various compositions and characteristics of the organic fractions graphical abstract image 1 keywords fe ii uv chlorine membrane fouling natural organic matter nom oxidation coagulation 1 introduction membrane technology in water and wastewater treatment remains popular by cause of increasingly stringent demand and criteria yu et al 2018 ultrafiltration uf membrane serves as a bright strategy due to its effective removal of particles micro organisms and other organic contaminants henderson et al 2011 however membrane fouling still hinders further application as it may reduce productivity and raise energy consumption peter varbanets et al 2011 natural organic matter nom was normally recognized as a problematic source of the membrane foulants which mainly included humic like substance yuan and zydney 2000 proteins and polysaccharides laabs et al 2006 and these typical organic fractions were demonstrated as the main components for the formation of hydraulic reversible and irreversible membrane fouling lee and kim 2014 among these strategies to alleviate membrane fouling pretreatment prior to membrane filtration process has been employed as a common and energetic resolution wang et al 2017 the pretreatments were supposed to reduce the organic loadings or modify the characteristics of feed water so the fouling could be controlled the several pretreatment methods were generally utilized for membrane fouling mitigation including coagulation alizadeh tabatabai et al 2014 oxidation wang et al 2017 adsorption xing et al 2019 and their integration yu et al 2016 although the frequently adopted pretreatments exhibited certain influence on controlling membrane fouling some problems still occurred during the practical operation for various water sources it was reported that the meso particles formed from the pre coagulation process were difficult to manage and it tended to induce hydraulic irreversible membrane fouling along with the filtration ding et al 2016 the pac adsorption process was observed to have complex effects on membrane fouling behavior the pac adsorption could reduce the organic loadings on uf membrane surface while it might also form a dense and synergistic cake layer with the various organic components in feed water shao et al 2016 which was difficult to be removed by backwash previous studies also indicated the membrane fouling control by pre ozonation might be closely related to the feed water condition and the quality of permeate water may deteriorate in water supply network cheng et al 2016 liu et al 2013 therefore it is necessary to solve these problems with new strategies uv based advanced oxidation processes uv aops have been promising strategies for drinking water treatment attributed to the strong oxidative radicals generated zhang et al 2018 and uv chlorine process has currently drawn noticeable attention as it has been proven to effectively decompose a wide scope of organic contaminants in the aquatic environment zoschke et al 2014 it was also observed that the uv chlorine process was valid for eliminating nom fractions at a broad spectrum with the powerful ho and cl species guo et al 2018 fe ii is a commonly employed chemical for water treatment as it is a cheap and effective coagulant additionally it has been also utilized in the role of a favorable initial agent for generating radicals from oxidants with the existence of chlorine ho and cl were also simultaneously developed along with the in situ formation of fe iii from fe ii coledam et al 2018 moreover the uv irradiation could enhance the productivity of hydroxyl radicals from fe ii in alkaline or neutral solutions the previous study on fe ii initiated oxidation was mainly operated to degrade pollutants in acidic conditions to prevent ferric hydrolysis ji et al 2015 however its application for membrane fouling control under neutral aquatic environment was rarely studied it is noticeable that the co existence of uv or fe ii activated radicals and in situ formed fe iii might exhibit synergetic membrane fouling control the combination of uv aops and fe ii was expected to be efficient for micropollutants and algae removal jia et al 2018 however the cl radical involved with uv chlorine process has not been investigated in the integration with fe ii it is significant to comprehensively understand the effects of the combination on uf membrane fouling control the objective of this work is to explore the performance of fe ii uv chlorine pretreatment on alleviating membrane fouling induced by various fractions of nom including humic acid ha sodium alginate sa bovine serum albumin bsa and their mixture hsb the fe ii coagulation pretreatment was also conducted for comparison the effects of the pretreatments on membrane fouling reduction were evaluated by the development of trans membrane pressure fouling reversibility and calculation of fouling indices the organic matter removal was estimated and the change of characteristics was investigated through fluorescent spectra and molecular weight distribution moreover the membrane foulants were extracted and characterized using excitation emission matrix eem spectra the correlations between organic loadings and fouling indices were processed to analyze and predict membrane fouling behavior 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampled waters and reagents the synthetic water samples were prepared to simulate natural surface water sources for drinking water treatment ha sa bsa supplied by sigma aldrich usa were utilized to represent humic matters polysaccharides and protein substances respectively the stock solutions 1 0 g l of these three model organic matter pollutants were prepared by diluting 1 0 g of ha sa and bsa in 1 l

dpd was purchased from merck germany the other analytical grade chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich usa the stock solutions of naclo and fecl2 were prepared freshly and standardized by the dpd spectrophotometric method and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes respectively for individual ha sa and bsa feed water samples the concentration of each single fraction was diluted to 10 mg l to simulated diverse feed sample conditions from water sources for drinking water supply the mixture of the model organic fractions was prepared at various proportions when the mixtures of ha sa bsa were employed to inspect the combined membrane fouling the total concentration was controlled at 10 mg l with various proportions all the feed samples were adjusted to neutral with the ph at 7 0 0 1 2 2 experimental set up as shown in fig 1 fe ii uv chlorine denoted as fuc1 fuc2 and fuc3 and fe ii coagulation denoted as fe1 fe2 and fe3 were employed as pretreatment options for uf membranes respectively the pretreatment experiment was performed in brown triangular flasks the fe ii uv chlorine oxidation was initiated by adding the mixture of naclo and fecl2 solutions at certain dosages under determined uv exposure and the coagulation was conducted by desired doses of fe ii for comparison in this study the initial effective chlorine concentration of 1 2 and 4 mg l and fe ii dosage of 7 5 15 and 30 Î¼m were applied for fe ii uv chlorine process respectively the dosages of fe ii and chlorine were determined according to the reactions in table 1 the uv addition was supplied with the irradiation intensity of 2 4 mw cm2 during the initial 5 min of fe ii uv chlorine processes both fe ii uv chlorine and fe ii coagulation pretreatment was conducted under rapid mixing at 240 r min for 5 min followed by slow stirring at 60 rpm for 15 min the treated water solutions were instantly adopted as feed water for uf membrane filtration then the membrane filtration experiments were performed with the oxidation resistant polyethersulfone pes flat sheet membrane provided by microdyn nadir germany the molecular weight cut off mwco of the utilized membrane is 150 kda and the contact angle is 62 4 2 9 before the filtration experiments the membrane sheet was cleaned by soaking in 25 ethanol for 2 h and then washed by pure water the filtration process was conducted through a filtration cell in dead end mode at a stable flux of 150 l m2h which was preserved with a peristaltic pump the trans membrane pressure tmp during filtration was measured and instantly recorded by a pressure transducer coupled with a computer in this experiment each filtration test was conducted with three cycles and backwash was carried out by double fluxes to force the surface membrane foulants falling off 2 3 membrane fouling evaluation the resistance in series model was utilized to investigate the effects of pretreatment on membrane fouling behavior as shown in eq

recorded with the total volume of feed water pa tmp 0 is the initial filtration pressure of pure water pa v is specific permeate volume filtrated volume membrane area m fi could be calculated as total or irreversible fouling index tfi or hifi when the specific p and v were experimentally figured out 2 4 analytical methods the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc was measured by a total organic carbon toc analyzer jena germany and uv254 was determined through an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer hitachi japan the water samples were pre filtered by 0 45 Î¼m mixed fiber membrane before the measurement of doc and uv254 the zeta potential of raw and treated samples was determined by a zetasizer marlvern britain at a ph of 7 5 0 1 excitation emission matrix eem spectra analysis was utilized to identify the fluorescent components in water samples using a fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi japan the eem spectra were achieved with excitation wavelengths ex emission wavelengths em of 200 450 nm 250 550 nm respectively the measurement of each sample was operated in a 1 cm quartz cuvette at room temperature 20 1 c and the raman scatter peaks ex em 350 nm 381 426 nm were mostly removed through subtraction of the ultrapure water spectrum meanwhile the raman scatter peaks of pure water were utilized for raman normalization and raman units r u nm 1 were derived to suggest fluorescence intensities the size exclusion chromatography sec coupled with doc detection sec ocd was employed to determine the molecular weight mw distribution of organic substances in water samples it was conducted using the high performance liquid chromatography agilent1200 usa with a silica gel column tsk gel g4000pwxl japan and a portable toc analyzer suez m9 france the phosphate buffer solution 0 018 mol l of kh2po4 and 0 008 mol l of na2hpo4 ph 6 85 was applied as the liquid mobile phase and its flow rate was maintained at 0 6 ml min the extraction of hydraulic irreversible membrane foulants adhered to membrane pores was performed at the end of full cycle filtration the membranes after backwash were soaked in the alkaline solution 0 01 mol l of naoh for 24 h the extracted solutions were then adjusted to neutral ph and preserved at 4 c for analysis in addition an analysis of variance anova was employed to statistically compare the experimental data using matlab mathworks usa at the significance level of p 0 05 the comparison between p value and the derived significance level was used to assess the null hypothesis if p 0 05 the null hypothesis was rejected and it indicated the difference was significant the correlation fitting of water quality parameters and fouling indices was also performed and evaluated for fouling behavior analysis and prediction 3 results 3 1 tmp curves and fouling reversibility 3 1 1 ha fouling as shown in fig 2 the effects of fe ii uv chlorine pretreatment on membrane fouling caused by ha were investigated the tmp increase curve in fig 2 a indicated that the untreated ha solutions led to significant fouling accumulation the terminal tmp increased to 46 5 66 9 and 71 8 kpa during the first second and final filtration cycle from initial tmp of 21 7 kpa respectively the filtration pressure was obviously reduced by fe ii uv chlorine pretreatment with a dosage of 7 5 Î¼m 1 mg l 1 7 5 Î¼m of fe2 and 1 mg l of chlorine with the increasing dose of fe2 and chlorine the tmp during filtration was even more reduced ascribed to nearly 45 kpa of reduction at the terminal of the third filtration cycle the pressure increase curve was almost turned to be horizontal with fe ii uv chlorine pre oxidation at the dose of 30 Î¼m 4 mg l 1 the ha feed water samples were also pre treated by fe2 coagulation as a comparison to fe ii uv chlorine process under the dose of 7 5 Î¼m the obvious reduced increase in tmp growth was achieved by coagulation pretreatment however the efficiency of fouling mitigation was not greatly improved with a higher dose of fe2 the coagulation pretreatment obtained similar effects on tmp reduction to the low dosage of fe ii uv chlorine 7 5 Î¼m 1 mg l 1 as the final filtration pressure of the third period ended at 49 9 53 5 kpa fig 2 b illustrated the reversibility of membrane fouling induced by raw and treated ha solutions the most serious average total and irreversible fouling among the filtration cycles were resulted from untreated ha feed water with the resistance value of 4 51 and 1 88 1011 m 1 respectively when the fe ii uv chlorine pretreatment was employed both total and irreversible fouling apparently declined at the rate of 36 88 and 72 86 respectively it could be also seen that the irreversible membrane fouling preferred to be decreased in contrast to reversible fouling especially for the lower dose of fe2 and chlorine the reversible resistance of untreated and fe ii uv chlorine 7 5 Î¼m 1 mg l 1 pre treated ha solution was close at the value of 2 63 and 2 37 1011 m 1 while the irreversible resistance of fuc treated sample was significantly lower in addition the effects of coagulation pretreatment on total membrane fouling were comparable to fe ii uv chlorine 7 5 Î¼m 1 mg l 1 pre oxidation at various coagulant dosage fig 2 b however the fe ii uv chlorine process showed excellent performance in irreversible resistance reduction during the filtration of ha feed water 3 1 2 bsa fouling as fig 3 a illustrated the membrane foulants accumulated critically when untreated bsa was filtrated as the end tmp increased to 79 2 and 83 6 kpa at the latter two filtration cycles the membrane fouling was dramatically reduced by fe ii uv chlorine oxidation and the notable efficiency was achieved at the low dosage of 7 5 Î¼m 1 mg l 1 the performance of filtration pressure control was slightly improved with a higher dose of 30 Î¼m 4 mg l 1 by which the terminal tmp was declined from 52 1 79 2 and 83 6 kpa to 26 1 29 5 and 33 8 kpa during the first second and third period respectively in comparison with fe ii uv chlorine oxidation the coagulation pretreatment exhibited limited promotion in membrane fouling mitigation for bsa feed samples the most obvious fouling decrease by pre coagulation was obtained at fe2 dosage of 15 Î¼m and the final tmp was reduced by 7 7 12 4 kpa during the filtration cycles and with the increasing fe2 concentration in coagulation pretreatment it weakened the efficiency of membrane fouling control which is consistent with the previous study cheng et al 2017 fig 3 b showed that the raw bsa solution induced serious reversible and irreversible membrane fouling even though the fe2 coagulation had some impacts on alleviating the total fouling resistance it could be found that the reversible membrane fouling was even lightly aggravated especially under low dosage of 7 5 Î¼m fig 3 b when fe ii uv chlorine was applied the average reversible fouling resistance declined significantly by the rate of approximately 90 and the dosage variation displayed little influence the total and irreversible resistance was also greatly mitigated and the decreased rates were 83 84 and 76 79 respectively it is noteworthy that the distribution of reversible and irreversible fouling was apparently changed compared to untreated feed water and a higher dose of fe ii chlorine in fuc improved the proportion of irreversible resistance this effect is attributed to the better performance of alleviating irreversible fouling and relatively lessened reduction of reversible fouling resistance with a lower dose of fe ii and chlorine in the fuc process 3 1 3 sa fouling as illustrated in fig 4 a the membranes were impressively fouled during the filtration of untreated sa samples with rapid development of tmp at the initial stage during each cycle fe ii uv chlorine pretreatment effectively reduced the final filtration pressure through restraining the rate of tmp development at the beginning of filtration periods the fouling mitigation performance was promoted with higher fe ii and chlorine dose and the most satisfactory results were obtained at the dosage of 30 Î¼m 4 mg l 1 by which the terminal filtration pressure was reduced by 51 9 58 2 kpa during the three filtration cycles when the coagulation was employed the initial increase of tmp was finitely retarded while the pressure rose relatively slowly at the later stage in each cycle and the final tmp of coagulation with 30 Î¼m of fe2 was comparable to that of fuc1 fig 4 b showed that severe reversible fouling accrued on the membrane as the reversible resistance was dominant in the distribution of total membrane fouling this result agreed with the previous report which indicated that the cake or gel layer was easily formed by sa li et al 2014 it could be noted that the reversible fouling could be effectively reduced with fe ii uv chlorine pretreatment and the performance varied with the dose the decrease rate of reversible fouling resistance by fuc processes at the dosage of 7 5 Î¼m 1 mg l 1 and 15 Î¼m 2 mg l 1 was close at 51 and 55 respectively while further addition of fe ii chlorine dosage at 30 Î¼m 4 mg l 1 exhibited significant improvement by the rate of 96 in addition the irreversible fouling resistance was also reduced by 19 30 with fe ii uv chlorine oxidation in contrast to the fuc process the coagulation pretreatment caused even more serious irreversible membrane fouling when 7 5 or 15 Î¼m of fe2 was employed in addition the mitigation of total membrane fouling between coagulation at a high dose 30 Î¼m and fe ii uv chlorine oxidation at a low dose 7 5 Î¼m 1 mg l 1 was comparable which was similar to the condition of ha feed water 3 1 4 mixed ha sa bsa fouling considering that natural water resources tend to contain humic substances proteins and polysaccharides simultaneously the ha sa bsa mixture by various proportion was utilized to inspect the influence of fuc process on the combined membrane fouling fe ii chlorine with the dosage of 15 Î¼m 2 mg l 1 in fuc treatment was employed to distinguish the performance of fouling mitigation with different compositions of the mixture as shown in fig 5 a fe ii uv chlorine process displayed a great impact on the fouling alleviation for the mixed solutions the filtration pressure was obviously reduced and the terminal tmp of the third cycle was decreased from 71 8 to 86 0 kpa for single contaminate figs 2 4 to 30 7 48 8 kpa for the mixture fig 5 moreover the varying proportion of the pollutants showed a noticeable effect on fouling mitigation when the humic substances and proteins were dominant in feed water samples hsb of 313 and 212 the efficiency of filtration was significantly improved by fe ii uv chlorine as the final tmp was reduced to 26 4 30 7 kpa and the performance of fouling mitigation was enhanced with the lower proportion of sa fig 5 c illustrated the reversibility of combined membrane fouling caused by the treated mixture it could be seen that the irreversible fouling caused by the various mixture after fe ii uv chlorine oxidation was close at the range of 0 28 0 54 1011 m 1 regardless of the evident discrepancy of total membrane fouling the reversible fouling resistance took over a high proportion of total fouling resistance which could be easily removed through hydraulic backwash and the reversible fouling was preferably resulted from the mixture containing a high ratio of sa presence which caused high tmp during the filtration by contrast coagulation alone showed limited effects on fouling alleviation caused by the mixture as shown in fig 5 b the tmp reached approximately 80 kpa during the filtration of sa dominated hsb mixture although the terminal pressure could be decreased by 30 35 kpa with coagulation when the humic substances and proteins were dominant in feed solutions the fouling resistance was still much higher than that of fe ii uv chlorine treatment fig 5 c also indicated that the more serious and higher proportion of irreversible fouling was induced with coagulation pretreatment in comparison with fe ii uv chlorine oxidation 3 2 characteristics of feed water and membrane foulants 3 2 1 doc and uv254 the varied removal performance of doc and uv254 by fe ii uv chlorine process is illustrated in fig 6 for the feed water of ha solutions the similar effects of doc removal were found with the pretreatment of fe ii uv chlorine or fe ii the better performance of doc elimination was obtained with a higher dosage of fe2 and chlorine in the fuc process with the dose increased from 7 5 Î¼m 1 mg l 1 to 30 Î¼m 4 mg l 1 the doc reduction rate raised from 9 3 to 34 it could also be observed that the improvement of doc removal was significant when the concentration of fe ii increased from 7 5 Î¼m to 15 Î¼m while the efficiency was comparable for 15 Î¼m and 30 Î¼m of fe2 during the treatment of all ha sa and bsa feed water the capability of doc removal by fe ii uv chlorine for different organic fractions followed the order of ha sa bsa the previous study also reported the similar regularity of humic substances and proteins removal efficiency with the presence of iron ions cheng et al 2017 the doc removal of the mixture treated by fe ii uv chlorine oxidation was investigated under the condition of 15 Î¼m 2 mg l 1 according to previous results it was indicated that the various compositions of the three organic matter affected the doc removal performance the mixture which mainly consisted of ha and bsa with a low proportion of sa exhibited the best ability of doc removal by fe ii uv chlorine at the rate of 25 28 as presented in fig 6 b due to the poor uv absorbance of sa and bsa solutions the removal of uv254 for ha solutions and the mixture was evaluated in this study the uv254 removal rate showed consistent trends to that of doc by dosage and the efficiency was much higher in terms of ha solutions the uv254 was reduced by 19 56 and 24 55 with the pretreatment of fe ii uv chlorine and fe ii respectively for the mixture feed samples the significant removal rate of 73 86 was achieved by fe ii uv chlorine with high ratios of ha and bsa which was consistent with the result of doc removal however the noticeable difference was observed when sa or bsa dominated in the solutions the uv254 removal of hsb 133 pretreated by fe ii uv chlorine and fe ii was 32 and 54 respectively the results suggested that the composition of feed water affected the organic matter removal and fe ii chlorine promoted removal efficiency at determined dosages for typical organic pollutants and their combination 3 2 2 fluorescent contaminate spectra to evaluate the impact of fe ii uv chlorine pretreatment on fluorescent substances removal the eem spectra of feed solutions were measured the eem analysis of sa was not examined as polysaccharides could not be detected using the fluorescence spectroscopy shao et al 2014 the removal efficiency focused on the mixture of ha sa bsa samples fig 7 and the correlation analysis was conducted in section 3 3 as presented in fig s1 three typical fluorescent peaks were found in the spectra including the peak of humic like components ex em 260 430 nm and two peaks of protein like substances ex em 225 340 nm and 275 340 nm carstea et al 2014 fig 7 showed the normalized fluorescence intensities calculated from parafac analysis shao et al 2014 of specific components in the mixture treated by fuc oxidation and fe ii coagulation in terms of humic like substances both fuc and fe ii processes displayed significant removal efficiency as described in fig 7 a the intensities of ha in various condition of the mixture were reduced from 0 75 0 9 0 96 0 77 0 78 0 58 and 0 51 in raw water to 0 25 0 21 0 18 0 22 0 31 0 17 and 0 18 after the treatment of fe ii uv chlorine respectively it was noteworthy that the higher removal rates of fluorescent humic substances were obtained when the feed water mainly consisted of ha and bsa with minor existence of sa the reduction of intensities reached 77 and 81 for the feed solution of hsb 212 and 313 the fe ii coagulation showed similar impact for humic like substances fig 7 b presented the intensities reduction for protein like components by fe ii uv chlorine and fe ii treatment in contrast to the humic like substances the performance in eliminating protein like pollutant displayed obvious discrepancy by fe ii uv chlorine and fe ii respectively the best removal of protein like intensities was obtained at 59 for the feed mixture of hsb 133 treated by fuc process which was much higher than that at 22 for hsb 212 by fe ii coagulation pretreatment the results suggested that fe ii uv chlorine process was effective for both fluorescent humic like and protein like components elimination 3 2 3 molecular weight distribution the lc ocd chromatogram was proved to be more sensitive than lc uv detection for the dissolved organic pollutants her et al 2002 myat et al 2014 in this study two important peak clusters were found in the untreated feed water representing protein polymers 20 kda and humic substances 1 15 kda respectively subhi et al 2012 the apparent molecular weight mw distribution in feed solutions treated by fe ii uv chlorine oxidation was shown in fig s2 and the effects of fe ii uv chlorine and fe ii treatment on three practical solutions were emphasized in fig 8 which included the ha dominated with bsa mixture hsb 313 ha dominated with sa mixture hsb 331 and sa dominated with bsa mixture hsb 133 as presented in fig 8 the peaks for bsa components of higher molecular weight were significantly decreased by fe ii uv chlorine in hsb313 mixture the fe ii treatment also exhibited a similar reduction of humic substances while peaks for protein substances were higher than that of fe ii uv chlorine for the mixture of hsb331 the reduction of bsa peaks by fe ii uv chlorine was comparable to coagulation pretreatment especially for the higher mw components and the peaks of humic substances were further decreased compared to the hsb313 mixture as a clear gap was observed between the response curves of fe ii uv chlorine and fe ii treatment in contrast the variation of mw distribution exhibited different trends for the hsb122 mixture it could be observed that fe ii uv chlorine effectively removed the bsa peaks while fe ii coagulation alone was not effective and the distinction was more noticeable for higher mw components 3 2 4 characterization of membrane fouling the fluorescent spectra of hydraulic irreversible membrane fouling caused by various feed water were presented in fig s3 in terms of the mixture hsb313 the peaks derived from protein like substances ex em 275 350 nm and ex em 225 350 nm were significant in pore foulants but the humic like substances were hardly observed despite the same proportion of ha and bsa in feed solutions moreover the mixture hsb313 treated by fe ii uv chlorine oxidation induced more homologous fouling from humic and protein like contaminates while the fe ii preferred to cause more serious protein foulants as shown in figs s3 c and d fe ii uv chlorine oxidation apparently reduced the irreversible humic like fouling compared to coagulation treatment for the mixture of hsb331 the intensity of peak a ex em 260 430 nm and peak c ex em 350 430 nm was reduced from 342 to 217 with fe ii coagulation to 153 and 143 with fuc process respectively the results were consistent with the fouling resistance reduction in fig 5 previous study also indicated that deposition of foulants in membrane pore was easily found with pre coagulation alone yu and graham 2015 the hydraulic reversible foulants of different feed samples treated by fe ii uv chlorine and fe ii were also characterized in fig s4 it was suggested that the untreated feed water preferred to produce compact and dense fouling gel cake during the filtration period chang et al 2017 the pre coagulation treatment could limitedly turn the surface fouling into a loose phase especially for ha and bsa dominated solutions when the water samples were treated by fe ii uv chlorine process the conversion of hydraulic reversible foulants was noticeable as impressive particles and breakage of fouling cake were figured out fig s4 the surface pictures in fig s4 were taken at the end of the first filtration cycle before hydraulic backwash as indicated the porous morphology of the fouled membrane was consistent with the reduced tmp increase and fouling resistances in section 3 1 the results indicated that the fe ii uv chlorine process exhibited positive performance on reduction of irreversible foulants and conversion of reversible membrane fouling 3 2 5 correlation of fouling and organic matter as illustrated in fig 9 the value of tfi and hifi was calculated and linear regression was conducted between fi and characteristics of feed water the tfi of raw water was largest with its value of ha bsa and sa were 8 3 8 6 and 17 7 m 1 respectively on the contrary the hifi of sa solution was much lower at the value of 1 7 m 1 and those of ha and bsa were 3 9 and 5 3 m 1 respectively both tfi and hifi were remarkably reduced by fe ii uv chlorine oxidation for various organic components and their mixture the correlations of fi and fluorescent components were illustrated in fig 9 a d and the linear regression results of doc and uv254 was presented fig s5 it could be recognized in figs s5 a c e that the correlation between fouling indices tfi and hifi and doc was found insignificant for the different organic matter fractions for the ha solutions although the fouling mitigation was obvious with the pretreatment of fe ii uv chlorine p 0 05 the correlation between uv254 and tfi was still slight however the correlation between hifi and uv254 in the mixture solutions was much more apparent with the r2 value of 0 7928 when the mixture of hsb was filtrated the correlation between doc and fouling index was even more insignificant than the single organic fraction and uv254 was observed more correlative with tfi and hifi than doc fig 9 a d presented the correlations between f max of fluorescent components and fouling indices as shown in fig 9 a and b the f max of ha or bsa exhibited a strong correlation with hifi r2 0 8094 and 0 9360 and certain correlation with tfi r2 0 5643 and 0 9389 respectively the results implied that the reduction of both humic and protein like fluorescent components by fe ii uv chlorine treatment was obviously related to the fouling control the results were consistent with the previous study that the removal of fluorescent substances was responsible for fouling mitigation wei et al 2016 and both the correlation to tfi and hifi should be considered for the analysis of fouling behavior for natural feed water for the hsb mixture the correlations between f max of humic like fluorescent and tfi were not comparable to single organic fractions as the r2 was 0 1915 between f max and hifi however the correlations between f max of protein like substances and tfi r2 0 6846 were more significant than that between uv254 and tfi r2 0 6538 during the filtration of treated mixture feed water the results suggested detection of fluorescent components are sensitive for membrane fouling prediction when the samples were pre treated by fe ii uv chlorine especially for the single organic fractions 4 discussion the above results suggested that the fuc process was an effective pretreatment strategy to mitigate uf membrane fouling accumulation and enhance organic pollutant removal the principal reactions during the fuc pretreatment were summarized in table 1 the filtration pressure development was apparently decreased by fe ii uv chlorine process compared to fe ii coagulation which was probably attributed to the dual influence of oxidation and simultaneously formed fe iii the in situ formed fe iii was supposed to behave as a coagulant as shown in table 2 the zeta potential of different natural organic fractions was changed by fe ii uv chlorine and coagulation the proper neutralization in feed water samples could lead to the easier forming of larger flocs sharp et al 2006 which were likely to be seized by uf membranes through the molecular interception alizadeh tabatabai et al 2014 the zeta potential of the organic components was modified to be even more neutral by fe ii uv chlorine due to the oxidation of organic coating on particles gao et al 2011 accordingly the membrane fouling induced by them was significantly alleviated at a proper dosage of fe ii and chlorine for the sa solutions the total and irreversible fouling was limitedly reduced at a low dose of fe ii and chlorine in the fuc process the previous study reported that the coagulation process for sa tends to form some micro flocs which could promote the pore blocking behavior during the following membrane filtration listiarini et al 2009 this phenomenon was also consistent with the poor improvement of fouling control by fe ii alone during sa filtration fig 4 for the hsb mixture the feed water containing a lower proportion of sa promoted greater efficiency for membrane fouling mitigation compared to the sa dominated samples even so the filtration of the hsb mixture was improved by fe ii uv chlorine due to the reduction of total and irreversible fouling mitigation apart from the simultaneously formed fe iii the radicals generated in fe ii uv chlorine process played an important role in the characteristic transform of organic fractions and cutback of foulants the doc and uv254 in feed water solutions were effectively reduced by fe ii uv chlorine which was responsible for the alleviation of membrane fouling park et al 2017 the hocl in the solutions was activated by uv light and fe ii which could produce both ho reaction 1 and cl reaction 5 radicals moreover the uv exposure could also lead to the formation of ho from the fe ii under alkaline conditions reaction 7 attributed to the strong oxidative species generated from the fuc process the better performance of fluorescent organic components removal was obtained in comparison with fe ii coagulation the discrepancy between fe ii uv chlorine and fe ii processes for protein like substances removal was observed more significant than humic like components which could be attributed to the activated radicals table 1 in addition ho and cl radicals generated in the fuc process were effective in the decomposition of organic pollutants over a wide mw distribution as well when the mixture contained a high proportion of sa the coagulation with in situ formed fe iii or fe ii alone lacked the ability for fouling control the fe ii uv chlorine oxidation exhibited satisfactory influence in the reduction of membrane foulants due to higher selectivity of cl than ho for electronic moieties in unsaturated bonds some compounds were preferred to be destructed by cl xing et al 2018 simultaneously the cl refractory substances and some other components were decomposed by ho the combination promoted the extensive degradation of the high and low mw organics which was significant to alleviate the cake layer and pore blocking membrane fouling lee et al 2013 as a result of the effective elimination of organic loadings in feed water solutions fe ii uv chlorine also showed satisfactory performance in diminishing accumulated foulants in membrane pores the fluorescent spectra of irreversible foulants suggested the feed water treated by fe ii uv chlorine process caused less hydraulic irreversible fouling in the different mixture especially for the humic like contaminates this could be attributed to that the mw of humic like fractions tended to be lower than that of protein like components it could be seen in fig s2 c that the raw bsa solutions contained a more obvious peak than the ha solutions during earlier retention time while the ha solutions included more and stronger peaks for the low mw components and the small humic like substances preferred to form the pore blocking instead of cake gel foulants henderson et al 2011 the results were consistent with the higher removal efficiency of low mw organics through the strong oxidative species in fe ii uv chlorine oxidation moreover the correlations between fouling indices fi and characteristics of organic fractions provided a promising prediction of the membrane fouling behavior when fe ii uv chlorine was applied the fi was positively correlated with the f max when the three single organic fractions were filtrated fig 9 the value of r2 was over 0 93 for both tfi and hifi in bsa solutions which indicated the eem spectra could be a valid index to predict the fouling formation when protein like solutions were treated by fe ii uv chlorine oxidation poor correlation was found between the doc uv254 and tfi for ha solutions while the values of hifi could be closely related to eem spectra this could provide a supplemental basis for irreversible fouling prediction caused by humic acid besides the fouling indices and organics in mixture solutions were poorly correlated after fe ii uv chlorine process except for the certain correlation between tfi and humic like fluorescent intensities r2 0 6846 therefore although the eem spectra showed positive ability to monitor fouling behavior for the single fraction treated by fe ii uv chlorine and some other feed water it might be not as effective for the complex feed samples after fuc treatment in general it was indicated that the fuc process could be a satisfactory pretreatment for uf membrane it alleviated the membrane fouling induced by various organic fractions and simultaneously improved the water quality meanwhile it should be noticed that these outcomes were achieved depending on typical alternative organics which might differ from the real water resources the various mixture of the organic pollutant was utilized to simulate the diverse water conditions and the fe ii uv chlorine process was proved still valid for reducing membrane fouling which indicated this pretreatment could be an alternative method in water purification additionally this study was performed through a batch lab reactor the derived results might have a discrepancy with continuous operation at a long time and the addition of uv chlorine may raise the operating cost thus further continuous operation and specific cost analysis should be promoted for the full scale application 5 conclusion in this work the performance of fe ii uv chlorine as a pretreatment method prior to uf process was evaluated the fouling mitigation and characteristics of different organic fractions were investigated the following conclusions can be drawn 1 during the filtration of different organic fractions and their mixture the membrane fouling was significantly alleviated by fe ii uv chlorine higher dosage of fe ii and chlorine lead to better effects of fouling mitigation through fe ii uv chlorine treatment the fouling control performance was observed better than coagulation alone at the same dose of iron ions which could be attributed to the oxidation process during fe ii uv chlorine 2 fe ii uv chlorine exhibited similar removal rate of doc and uv254 for different organic fractions compared to single coagulation as the coagulation process played an important role for organic matter removal in the pretreatments the better performance of fluorescent components reduction was obtained by fe ii uv chlorine process fe ii uv chlorine was also effective in degrading a wider mw range of organic pollutants which were responsible for the various forms of membrane fouling 3 the hydraulic irreversible membrane foulants were significantly reduced by fe ii uv chlorine due to the satisfying reduction of low mw contaminants the decreased fouling in membrane pore was positive for long term stable and economic operation the feed water dominated by humic and protein like substances with a minor proportion of polysaccharide achieved great performance on fouling control with fuc process 4 for humic and protein like substances the membrane fouling behavior could be well predicted through fluorescence intensities after the single organic fractions were pretreated by fe ii uv chlorine process whereas the positive correlation was only found between humic r u intensities and tfi during the hsb mixture filtration with fe ii uv chlorine treatment the eem spectra might be invalid for the prediction of protein caused fouling declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

18446,fe ii uv chlorine was promoted as a pretreatment strategy for uf membrane to mitigate membrane fouling induced from different organic fractions this treatment could be an emerging alternative prior to uf process attributed to the coupled role of oxidation and coagulation to obtain a comprehensive understanding of fouling reduction the influence of fe ii uv chlorine process on the characteristics of various feed solutions was inspected including humic acid ha bovine serum albumin bsa sodium alginate sa and their mixture hsb the results suggested that fe ii uv chlorine process exhibited notable performance on membrane fouling control compared to fe ii coagulation alone with the uv exposure of 720 mj cm2 the certain dose of fe ii and chlorine 15 Î¼m and 2 mg l effectively prevented the rapid development of fouling caused by the single organic fractions and their mixture and the increased dosage promoted the performance of membrane fouling mitigation the reduction of organic loadings and characteristics change of feed water took the main responsibility for the fouling alleviation the properties of membrane fouling and their correlation with feed water qualities were analyzed the results and insight analysis were supposed to evaluate and predict the effectiveness of fouling control when the feed solutions were pretreated by fe ii uv chlorine process according to various compositions and characteristics of the organic fractions graphical abstract image 1 keywords fe ii uv chlorine membrane fouling natural organic matter nom oxidation coagulation 1 introduction membrane technology in water and wastewater treatment remains popular by cause of increasingly stringent demand and criteria yu et al 2018 ultrafiltration uf membrane serves as a bright strategy due to its effective removal of particles micro organisms and other organic contaminants henderson et al 2011 however membrane fouling still hinders further application as it may reduce productivity and raise energy consumption peter varbanets et al 2011 natural organic matter nom was normally recognized as a problematic source of the membrane foulants which mainly included humic like substance yuan and zydney 2000 proteins and polysaccharides laabs et al 2006 and these typical organic fractions were demonstrated as the main components for the formation of hydraulic reversible and irreversible membrane fouling lee and kim 2014 among these strategies to alleviate membrane fouling pretreatment prior to membrane filtration process has been employed as a common and energetic resolution wang et al 2017 the pretreatments were supposed to reduce the organic loadings or modify the characteristics of feed water so the fouling could be controlled the several pretreatment methods were generally utilized for membrane fouling mitigation including coagulation alizadeh tabatabai et al 2014 oxidation wang et al 2017 adsorption xing et al 2019 and their integration yu et al 2016 although the frequently adopted pretreatments exhibited certain influence on controlling membrane fouling some problems still occurred during the practical operation for various water sources it was reported that the meso particles formed from the pre coagulation process were difficult to manage and it tended to induce hydraulic irreversible membrane fouling along with the filtration ding et al 2016 the pac adsorption process was observed to have complex effects on membrane fouling behavior the pac adsorption could reduce the organic loadings on uf membrane surface while it might also form a dense and synergistic cake layer with the various organic components in feed water shao et al 2016 which was difficult to be removed by backwash previous studies also indicated the membrane fouling control by pre ozonation might be closely related to the feed water condition and the quality of permeate water may deteriorate in water supply network cheng et al 2016 liu et al 2013 therefore it is necessary to solve these problems with new strategies uv based advanced oxidation processes uv aops have been promising strategies for drinking water treatment attributed to the strong oxidative radicals generated zhang et al 2018 and uv chlorine process has currently drawn noticeable attention as it has been proven to effectively decompose a wide scope of organic contaminants in the aquatic environment zoschke et al 2014 it was also observed that the uv chlorine process was valid for eliminating nom fractions at a broad spectrum with the powerful ho and cl species guo et al 2018 fe ii is a commonly employed chemical for water treatment as it is a cheap and effective coagulant additionally it has been also utilized in the role of a favorable initial agent for generating radicals from oxidants with the existence of chlorine ho and cl were also simultaneously developed along with the in situ formation of fe iii from fe ii coledam et al 2018 moreover the uv irradiation could enhance the productivity of hydroxyl radicals from fe ii in alkaline or neutral solutions the previous study on fe ii initiated oxidation was mainly operated to degrade pollutants in acidic conditions to prevent ferric hydrolysis ji et al 2015 however its application for membrane fouling control under neutral aquatic environment was rarely studied it is noticeable that the co existence of uv or fe ii activated radicals and in situ formed fe iii might exhibit synergetic membrane fouling control the combination of uv aops and fe ii was expected to be efficient for micropollutants and algae removal jia et al 2018 however the cl radical involved with uv chlorine process has not been investigated in the integration with fe ii it is significant to comprehensively understand the effects of the combination on uf membrane fouling control the objective of this work is to explore the performance of fe ii uv chlorine pretreatment on alleviating membrane fouling induced by various fractions of nom including humic acid ha sodium alginate sa bovine serum albumin bsa and their mixture hsb the fe ii coagulation pretreatment was also conducted for comparison the effects of the pretreatments on membrane fouling reduction were evaluated by the development of trans membrane pressure fouling reversibility and calculation of fouling indices the organic matter removal was estimated and the change of characteristics was investigated through fluorescent spectra and molecular weight distribution moreover the membrane foulants were extracted and characterized using excitation emission matrix eem spectra the correlations between organic loadings and fouling indices were processed to analyze and predict membrane fouling behavior 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampled waters and reagents the synthetic water samples were prepared to simulate natural surface water sources for drinking water treatment ha sa bsa supplied by sigma aldrich usa were utilized to represent humic matters polysaccharides and protein substances respectively the stock solutions 1 0 g l of these three model organic matter pollutants were prepared by diluting 1 0 g of ha sa and bsa in 1 l ultrapure water produced by the milli q system millipore usa ferrous chloride fecl2 sodium hypochlorite solution naclo the concentration of active chlorine 5 and n n diethyl p phenylenediamine sulfate dpd was purchased from merck germany the other analytical grade chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich usa the stock solutions of naclo and fecl2 were prepared freshly and standardized by the dpd spectrophotometric method and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes respectively for individual ha sa and bsa feed water samples the concentration of each single fraction was diluted to 10 mg l to simulated diverse feed sample conditions from water sources for drinking water supply the mixture of the model organic fractions was prepared at various proportions when the mixtures of ha sa bsa were employed to inspect the combined membrane fouling the total concentration was controlled at 10 mg l with various proportions all the feed samples were adjusted to neutral with the ph at 7 0 0 1 2 2 experimental set up as shown in fig 1 fe ii uv chlorine denoted as fuc1 fuc2 and fuc3 and fe ii coagulation denoted as fe1 fe2 and fe3 were employed as pretreatment options for uf membranes respectively the pretreatment experiment was performed in brown triangular flasks the fe ii uv chlorine oxidation was initiated by adding the mixture of naclo and fecl2 solutions at certain dosages under determined uv exposure and the coagulation was conducted by desired doses of fe ii for comparison in this study the initial effective chlorine concentration of 1 2 and 4 mg l and fe ii dosage of 7 5 15 and 30 Î¼m were applied for fe ii uv chlorine process respectively the dosages of fe ii and chlorine were determined according to the reactions in table 1 the uv addition was supplied with the irradiation intensity of 2 4 mw cm2 during the initial 5 min of fe ii uv chlorine processes both fe ii uv chlorine and fe ii coagulation pretreatment was conducted under rapid mixing at 240 r min for 5 min followed by slow stirring at 60 rpm for 15 min the treated water solutions were instantly adopted as feed water for uf membrane filtration then the membrane filtration experiments were performed with the oxidation resistant polyethersulfone pes flat sheet membrane provided by microdyn nadir germany the molecular weight cut off mwco of the utilized membrane is 150 kda and the contact angle is 62 4 2 9 before the filtration experiments the membrane sheet was cleaned by soaking in 25 ethanol for 2 h and then washed by pure water the filtration process was conducted through a filtration cell in dead end mode at a stable flux of 150 l m2h which was preserved with a peristaltic pump the trans membrane pressure tmp during filtration was measured and instantly recorded by a pressure transducer coupled with a computer in this experiment each filtration test was conducted with three cycles and backwash was carried out by double fluxes to force the surface membrane foulants falling off 2 3 membrane fouling evaluation the resistance in series model was utilized to investigate the effects of pretreatment on membrane fouling behavior as shown in eq 1 1 r t t m p Î¼ j r m r r r i r where r t m 1 represents the total resistance consisting of intrinsic membrane resistance r m m 1 hydraulic reversible resistance r r m 1 and irreversible resistance r ir m 1 tmp is the trans membrane pressure pa during filtration and j is the filtration flux m s Î¼ is the dynamic viscosity pa s r m was determined through the filtration of pure water eq 2 and the tmp was recorded as tmp 0 r t was calculated according to the final filtration pressure tmp 1 as shown in eq 3 after backwash the average filtration pressure of pure water was recorded as tmp 2 and r ir was determined from eq 4 2 r m t m p 0 Î¼ j 3 r t t m p 1 Î¼ j 4 r i r t m p 2 Î¼ j t m p 0 Î¼ j moreover the membrane fouling index fi was employed for further correlation analysis of membrane fouling behavior and the calculation could be conducted according to eq 5 5 p 1 fi v where p is the normalized filtration pressure defined as p tmp t tmp 0 tmp t is the specific filtration pressure recorded with the total volume of feed water pa tmp 0 is the initial filtration pressure of pure water pa v is specific permeate volume filtrated volume membrane area m fi could be calculated as total or irreversible fouling index tfi or hifi when the specific p and v were experimentally figured out 2 4 analytical methods the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc was measured by a total organic carbon toc analyzer jena germany and uv254 was determined through an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer hitachi japan the water samples were pre filtered by 0 45 Î¼m mixed fiber membrane before the measurement of doc and uv254 the zeta potential of raw and treated samples was determined by a zetasizer marlvern britain at a ph of 7 5 0 1 excitation emission matrix eem spectra analysis was utilized to identify the fluorescent components in water samples using a fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi japan the eem spectra were achieved with excitation wavelengths ex emission wavelengths em of 200 450 nm 250 550 nm respectively the measurement of each sample was operated in a 1 cm quartz cuvette at room temperature 20 1 c and the raman scatter peaks ex em 350 nm 381 426 nm were mostly removed through subtraction of the ultrapure water spectrum meanwhile the raman scatter peaks of pure water were utilized for raman normalization and raman units r u nm 1 were derived to suggest fluorescence intensities the size exclusion chromatography sec coupled with doc detection sec ocd was employed to determine the molecular weight mw distribution of organic substances in water samples it was conducted using the high performance liquid chromatography agilent1200 usa with a silica gel column tsk gel g4000pwxl japan and a portable toc analyzer suez m9 france the phosphate buffer solution 0 018 mol l of kh2po4 and 0 008 mol l of na2hpo4 ph 6 85 was applied as the liquid mobile phase and its flow rate was maintained at 0 6 ml min the extraction of hydraulic irreversible membrane foulants adhered to membrane pores was performed at the end of full cycle filtration the membranes after backwash were soaked in the alkaline solution 0 01 mol l of naoh for 24 h the extracted solutions were then adjusted to neutral ph and preserved at 4 c for analysis in addition an analysis of variance anova was employed to statistically compare the experimental data using matlab mathworks usa at the significance level of p 0 05 the comparison between p value and the derived significance level was used to assess the null hypothesis if p 0 05 the null hypothesis was rejected and it indicated the difference was significant the correlation fitting of water quality parameters and fouling indices was also performed and evaluated for fouling behavior analysis and prediction 3 results 3 1 tmp curves and fouling reversibility 3 1 1 ha fouling as shown in fig 2 the effects of fe ii uv chlorine pretreatment on membrane fouling caused by ha were investigated the tmp increase curve in fig 2 a indicated that the untreated ha solutions led to significant fouling accumulation the terminal tmp increased to 46 5 66 9 and 71 8 kpa during the first second and final filtration cycle from initial tmp of 21 7 kpa respectively the filtration pressure was obviously reduced by fe ii uv chlorine pretreatment with a dosage of 7 5 Î¼m 1 mg l 1 7 5 Î¼m of fe2 and 1 mg l of chlorine with the increasing dose of fe2 and chlorine the tmp during filtration was even more reduced ascribed to nearly 45 kpa of reduction at the terminal of the third filtration cycle the pressure increase curve was almost turned to be horizontal with fe ii uv chlorine pre oxidation at the dose of 30 Î¼m 4 mg l 1 the ha feed water samples were also pre treated by fe2 coagulation as a comparison to fe ii uv chlorine process under the dose of 7 5 Î¼m the obvious reduced increase in tmp growth was achieved by coagulation pretreatment however the efficiency of fouling mitigation was not greatly improved with a higher dose of fe2 the coagulation pretreatment obtained similar effects on tmp reduction to the low dosage of fe ii uv chlorine 7 5 Î¼m 1 mg l 1 as the final filtration pressure of the third period ended at 49 9 53 5 kpa fig 2 b illustrated the reversibility of membrane fouling induced by raw and treated ha solutions the most serious average total and irreversible fouling among the filtration cycles were resulted from untreated ha feed water with the resistance value of 4 51 and 1 88 1011 m 1 respectively when the fe ii uv chlorine pretreatment was employed both total and irreversible fouling apparently declined at the rate of 36 88 and 72 86 respectively it could be also seen that the irreversible membrane fouling preferred to be decreased in contrast to reversible fouling especially for the lower dose of fe2 and chlorine the reversible resistance of untreated and fe ii uv chlorine 7 5 Î¼m 1 mg l 1 pre treated ha solution was close at the value of 2 63 and 2 37 1011 m 1 while the irreversible resistance of fuc treated sample was significantly lower in addition the effects of coagulation pretreatment on total membrane fouling were comparable to fe ii uv chlorine 7 5 Î¼m 1 mg l 1 pre oxidation at various coagulant dosage fig 2 b however the fe ii uv chlorine process showed excellent performance in irreversible resistance reduction during the filtration of ha feed water 3 1 2 bsa fouling as fig 3 a illustrated the membrane foulants accumulated critically when untreated bsa was filtrated as the end tmp increased to 79 2 and 83 6 kpa at the latter two filtration cycles the membrane fouling was dramatically reduced by fe ii uv chlorine oxidation and the notable efficiency was achieved at the low dosage of 7 5 Î¼m 1 mg l 1 the performance of filtration pressure control was slightly improved with a higher dose of 30 Î¼m 4 mg l 1 by which the terminal tmp was declined from 52 1 79 2 and 83 6 kpa to 26 1 29 5 and 33 8 kpa during the first second and third period respectively in comparison with fe ii uv chlorine oxidation the coagulation pretreatment exhibited limited promotion in membrane fouling mitigation for bsa feed samples the most obvious fouling decrease by pre coagulation was obtained at fe2 dosage of 15 Î¼m and the final tmp was reduced by 7 7 12 4 kpa during the filtration cycles and with the increasing fe2 concentration in coagulation pretreatment it weakened the efficiency of membrane fouling control which is consistent with the previous study cheng et al 2017 fig 3 b showed that the raw bsa solution induced serious reversible and irreversible membrane fouling even though the fe2 coagulation had some impacts on alleviating the total fouling resistance it could be found that the reversible membrane fouling was even lightly aggravated especially under low dosage of 7 5 Î¼m fig 3 b when fe ii uv chlorine was applied the average reversible fouling resistance declined significantly by the rate of approximately 90 and the dosage variation displayed little influence the total and irreversible resistance was also greatly mitigated and the decreased rates were 83 84 and 76 79 respectively it is noteworthy that the distribution of reversible and irreversible fouling was apparently changed compared to untreated feed water and a higher dose of fe ii chlorine in fuc improved the proportion of irreversible resistance this effect is attributed to the better performance of alleviating irreversible fouling and relatively lessened reduction of reversible fouling resistance with a lower dose of fe ii and chlorine in the fuc process 3 1 3 sa fouling as illustrated in fig 4 a the membranes were impressively fouled during the filtration of untreated sa samples with rapid development of tmp at the initial stage during each cycle fe ii uv chlorine pretreatment effectively reduced the final filtration pressure through restraining the rate of tmp development at the beginning of filtration periods the fouling mitigation performance was promoted with higher fe ii and chlorine dose and the most satisfactory results were obtained at the dosage of 30 Î¼m 4 mg l 1 by which the terminal filtration pressure was reduced by 51 9 58 2 kpa during the three filtration cycles when the coagulation was employed the initial increase of tmp was finitely retarded while the pressure rose relatively slowly at the later stage in each cycle and the final tmp of coagulation with 30 Î¼m of fe2 was comparable to that of fuc1 fig 4 b showed that severe reversible fouling accrued on the membrane as the reversible resistance was dominant in the distribution of total membrane fouling this result agreed with the previous report which indicated that the cake or gel layer was easily formed by sa li et al 2014 it could be noted that the reversible fouling could be effectively reduced with fe ii uv chlorine pretreatment and the performance varied with the dose the decrease rate of reversible fouling resistance by fuc processes at the dosage of 7 5 Î¼m 1 mg l 1 and 15 Î¼m 2 mg l 1 was close at 51 and 55 respectively while further addition of fe ii chlorine dosage at 30 Î¼m 4 mg l 1 exhibited significant improvement by the rate of 96 in addition the irreversible fouling resistance was also reduced by 19 30 with fe ii uv chlorine oxidation in contrast to the fuc process the coagulation pretreatment caused even more serious irreversible membrane fouling when 7 5 or 15 Î¼m of fe2 was employed in addition the mitigation of total membrane fouling between coagulation at a high dose 30 Î¼m and fe ii uv chlorine oxidation at a low dose 7 5 Î¼m 1 mg l 1 was comparable which was similar to the condition of ha feed water 3 1 4 mixed ha sa bsa fouling considering that natural water resources tend to contain humic substances proteins and polysaccharides simultaneously the ha sa bsa mixture by various proportion was utilized to inspect the influence of fuc process on the combined membrane fouling fe ii chlorine with the dosage of 15 Î¼m 2 mg l 1 in fuc treatment was employed to distinguish the performance of fouling mitigation with different compositions of the mixture as shown in fig 5 a fe ii uv chlorine process displayed a great impact on the fouling alleviation for the mixed solutions the filtration pressure was obviously reduced and the terminal tmp of the third cycle was decreased from 71 8 to 86 0 kpa for single contaminate figs 2 4 to 30 7 48 8 kpa for the mixture fig 5 moreover the varying proportion of the pollutants showed a noticeable effect on fouling mitigation when the humic substances and proteins were dominant in feed water samples hsb of 313 and 212 the efficiency of filtration was significantly improved by fe ii uv chlorine as the final tmp was reduced to 26 4 30 7 kpa and the performance of fouling mitigation was enhanced with the lower proportion of sa fig 5 c illustrated the reversibility of combined membrane fouling caused by the treated mixture it could be seen that the irreversible fouling caused by the various mixture after fe ii uv chlorine oxidation was close at the range of 0 28 0 54 1011 m 1 regardless of the evident discrepancy of total membrane fouling the reversible fouling resistance took over a high proportion of total fouling resistance which could be easily removed through hydraulic backwash and the reversible fouling was preferably resulted from the mixture containing a high ratio of sa presence which caused high tmp during the filtration by contrast coagulation alone showed limited effects on fouling alleviation caused by the mixture as shown in fig 5 b the tmp reached approximately 80 kpa during the filtration of sa dominated hsb mixture although the terminal pressure could be decreased by 30 35 kpa with coagulation when the humic substances and proteins were dominant in feed solutions the fouling resistance was still much higher than that of fe ii uv chlorine treatment fig 5 c also indicated that the more serious and higher proportion of irreversible fouling was induced with coagulation pretreatment in comparison with fe ii uv chlorine oxidation 3 2 characteristics of feed water and membrane foulants 3 2 1 doc and uv254 the varied removal performance of doc and uv254 by fe ii uv chlorine process is illustrated in fig 6 for the feed water of ha solutions the similar effects of doc removal were found with the pretreatment of fe ii uv chlorine or fe ii the better performance of doc elimination was obtained with a higher dosage of fe2 and chlorine in the fuc process with the dose increased from 7 5 Î¼m 1 mg l 1 to 30 Î¼m 4 mg l 1 the doc reduction rate raised from 9 3 to 34 it could also be observed that the improvement of doc removal was significant when the concentration of fe ii increased from 7 5 Î¼m to 15 Î¼m while the efficiency was comparable for 15 Î¼m and 30 Î¼m of fe2 during the treatment of all ha sa and bsa feed water the capability of doc removal by fe ii uv chlorine for different organic fractions followed the order of ha sa bsa the previous study also reported the similar regularity of humic substances and proteins removal efficiency with the presence of iron ions cheng et al 2017 the doc removal of the mixture treated by fe ii uv chlorine oxidation was investigated under the condition of 15 Î¼m 2 mg l 1 according to previous results it was indicated that the various compositions of the three organic matter affected the doc removal performance the mixture which mainly consisted of ha and bsa with a low proportion of sa exhibited the best ability of doc removal by fe ii uv chlorine at the rate of 25 28 as presented in fig 6 b due to the poor uv absorbance of sa and bsa solutions the removal of uv254 for ha solutions and the mixture was evaluated in this study the uv254 removal rate showed consistent trends to that of doc by dosage and the efficiency was much higher in terms of ha solutions the uv254 was reduced by 19 56 and 24 55 with the pretreatment of fe ii uv chlorine and fe ii respectively for the mixture feed samples the significant removal rate of 73 86 was achieved by fe ii uv chlorine with high ratios of ha and bsa which was consistent with the result of doc removal however the noticeable difference was observed when sa or bsa dominated in the solutions the uv254 removal of hsb 133 pretreated by fe ii uv chlorine and fe ii was 32 and 54 respectively the results suggested that the composition of feed water affected the organic matter removal and fe ii chlorine promoted removal efficiency at determined dosages for typical organic pollutants and their combination 3 2 2 fluorescent contaminate spectra to evaluate the impact of fe ii uv chlorine pretreatment on fluorescent substances removal the eem spectra of feed solutions were measured the eem analysis of sa was not examined as polysaccharides could not be detected using the fluorescence spectroscopy shao et al 2014 the removal efficiency focused on the mixture of ha sa bsa samples fig 7 and the correlation analysis was conducted in section 3 3 as presented in fig s1 three typical fluorescent peaks were found in the spectra including the peak of humic like components ex em 260 430 nm and two peaks of protein like substances ex em 225 340 nm and 275 340 nm carstea et al 2014 fig 7 showed the normalized fluorescence intensities calculated from parafac analysis shao et al 2014 of specific components in the mixture treated by fuc oxidation and fe ii coagulation in terms of humic like substances both fuc and fe ii processes displayed significant removal efficiency as described in fig 7 a the intensities of ha in various condition of the mixture were reduced from 0 75 0 9 0 96 0 77 0 78 0 58 and 0 51 in raw water to 0 25 0 21 0 18 0 22 0 31 0 17 and 0 18 after the treatment of fe ii uv chlorine respectively it was noteworthy that the higher removal rates of fluorescent humic substances were obtained when the feed water mainly consisted of ha and bsa with minor existence of sa the reduction of intensities reached 77 and 81 for the feed solution of hsb 212 and 313 the fe ii coagulation showed similar impact for humic like substances fig 7 b presented the intensities reduction for protein like components by fe ii uv chlorine and fe ii treatment in contrast to the humic like substances the performance in eliminating protein like pollutant displayed obvious discrepancy by fe ii uv chlorine and fe ii respectively the best removal of protein like intensities was obtained at 59 for the feed mixture of hsb 133 treated by fuc process which was much higher than that at 22 for hsb 212 by fe ii coagulation pretreatment the results suggested that fe ii uv chlorine process was effective for both fluorescent humic like and protein like components elimination 3 2 3 molecular weight distribution the lc ocd chromatogram was proved to be more sensitive than lc uv detection for the dissolved organic pollutants her et al 2002 myat et al 2014 in this study two important peak clusters were found in the untreated feed water representing protein polymers 20 kda and humic substances 1 15 kda respectively subhi et al 2012 the apparent molecular weight mw distribution in feed solutions treated by fe ii uv chlorine oxidation was shown in fig s2 and the effects of fe ii uv chlorine and fe ii treatment on three practical solutions were emphasized in fig 8 which included the ha dominated with bsa mixture hsb 313 ha dominated with sa mixture hsb 331 and sa dominated with bsa mixture hsb 133 as presented in fig 8 the peaks for bsa components of higher molecular weight were significantly decreased by fe ii uv chlorine in hsb313 mixture the fe ii treatment also exhibited a similar reduction of humic substances while peaks for protein substances were higher than that of fe ii uv chlorine for the mixture of hsb331 the reduction of bsa peaks by fe ii uv chlorine was comparable to coagulation pretreatment especially for the higher mw components and the peaks of humic substances were further decreased compared to the hsb313 mixture as a clear gap was observed between the response curves of fe ii uv chlorine and fe ii treatment in contrast the variation of mw distribution exhibited different trends for the hsb122 mixture it could be observed that fe ii uv chlorine effectively removed the bsa peaks while fe ii coagulation alone was not effective and the distinction was more noticeable for higher mw components 3 2 4 characterization of membrane fouling the fluorescent spectra of hydraulic irreversible membrane fouling caused by various feed water were presented in fig s3 in terms of the mixture hsb313 the peaks derived from protein like substances ex em 275 350 nm and ex em 225 350 nm were significant in pore foulants but the humic like substances were hardly observed despite the same proportion of ha and bsa in feed solutions moreover the mixture hsb313 treated by fe ii uv chlorine oxidation induced more homologous fouling from humic and protein like contaminates while the fe ii preferred to cause more serious protein foulants as shown in figs s3 c and d fe ii uv chlorine oxidation apparently reduced the irreversible humic like fouling compared to coagulation treatment for the mixture of hsb331 the intensity of peak a ex em 260 430 nm and peak c ex em 350 430 nm was reduced from 342 to 217 with fe ii coagulation to 153 and 143 with fuc process respectively the results were consistent with the fouling resistance reduction in fig 5 previous study also indicated that deposition of foulants in membrane pore was easily found with pre coagulation alone yu and graham 2015 the hydraulic reversible foulants of different feed samples treated by fe ii uv chlorine and fe ii were also characterized in fig s4 it was suggested that the untreated feed water preferred to produce compact and dense fouling gel cake during the filtration period chang et al 2017 the pre coagulation treatment could limitedly turn the surface fouling into a loose phase especially for ha and bsa dominated solutions when the water samples were treated by fe ii uv chlorine process the conversion of hydraulic reversible foulants was noticeable as impressive particles and breakage of fouling cake were figured out fig s4 the surface pictures in fig s4 were taken at the end of the first filtration cycle before hydraulic backwash as indicated the porous morphology of the fouled membrane was consistent with the reduced tmp increase and fouling resistances in section 3 1 the results indicated that the fe ii uv chlorine process exhibited positive performance on reduction of irreversible foulants and conversion of reversible membrane fouling 3 2 5 correlation of fouling and organic matter as illustrated in fig 9 the value of tfi and hifi was calculated and linear regression was conducted between fi and characteristics of feed water the tfi of raw water was largest with its value of ha bsa and sa were 8 3 8 6 and 17 7 m 1 respectively on the contrary the hifi of sa solution was much lower at the value of 1 7 m 1 and those of ha and bsa were 3 9 and 5 3 m 1 respectively both tfi and hifi were remarkably reduced by fe ii uv chlorine oxidation for various organic components and their mixture the correlations of fi and fluorescent components were illustrated in fig 9 a d and the linear regression results of doc and uv254 was presented fig s5 it could be recognized in figs s5 a c e that the correlation between fouling indices tfi and hifi and doc was found insignificant for the different organic matter fractions for the ha solutions although the fouling mitigation was obvious with the pretreatment of fe ii uv chlorine p 0 05 the correlation between uv254 and tfi was still slight however the correlation between hifi and uv254 in the mixture solutions was much more apparent with the r2 value of 0 7928 when the mixture of hsb was filtrated the correlation between doc and fouling index was even more insignificant than the single organic fraction and uv254 was observed more correlative with tfi and hifi than doc fig 9 a d presented the correlations between f max of fluorescent components and fouling indices as shown in fig 9 a and b the f max of ha or bsa exhibited a strong correlation with hifi r2 0 8094 and 0 9360 and certain correlation with tfi r2 0 5643 and 0 9389 respectively the results implied that the reduction of both humic and protein like fluorescent components by fe ii uv chlorine treatment was obviously related to the fouling control the results were consistent with the previous study that the removal of fluorescent substances was responsible for fouling mitigation wei et al 2016 and both the correlation to tfi and hifi should be considered for the analysis of fouling behavior for natural feed water for the hsb mixture the correlations between f max of humic like fluorescent and tfi were not comparable to single organic fractions as the r2 was 0 1915 between f max and hifi however the correlations between f max of protein like substances and tfi r2 0 6846 were more significant than that between uv254 and tfi r2 0 6538 during the filtration of treated mixture feed water the results suggested detection of fluorescent components are sensitive for membrane fouling prediction when the samples were pre treated by fe ii uv chlorine especially for the single organic fractions 4 discussion the above results suggested that the fuc process was an effective pretreatment strategy to mitigate uf membrane fouling accumulation and enhance organic pollutant removal the principal reactions during the fuc pretreatment were summarized in table 1 the filtration pressure development was apparently decreased by fe ii uv chlorine process compared to fe ii coagulation which was probably attributed to the dual influence of oxidation and simultaneously formed fe iii the in situ formed fe iii was supposed to behave as a coagulant as shown in table 2 the zeta potential of different natural organic fractions was changed by fe ii uv chlorine and coagulation the proper neutralization in feed water samples could lead to the easier forming of larger flocs sharp et al 2006 which were likely to be seized by uf membranes through the molecular interception alizadeh tabatabai et al 2014 the zeta potential of the organic components was modified to be even more neutral by fe ii uv chlorine due to the oxidation of organic coating on particles gao et al 2011 accordingly the membrane fouling induced by them was significantly alleviated at a proper dosage of fe ii and chlorine for the sa solutions the total and irreversible fouling was limitedly reduced at a low dose of fe ii and chlorine in the fuc process the previous study reported that the coagulation process for sa tends to form some micro flocs which could promote the pore blocking behavior during the following membrane filtration listiarini et al 2009 this phenomenon was also consistent with the poor improvement of fouling control by fe ii alone during sa filtration fig 4 for the hsb mixture the feed water containing a lower proportion of sa promoted greater efficiency for membrane fouling mitigation compared to the sa dominated samples even so the filtration of the hsb mixture was improved by fe ii uv chlorine due to the reduction of total and irreversible fouling mitigation apart from the simultaneously formed fe iii the radicals generated in fe ii uv chlorine process played an important role in the characteristic transform of organic fractions and cutback of foulants the doc and uv254 in feed water solutions were effectively reduced by fe ii uv chlorine which was responsible for the alleviation of membrane fouling park et al 2017 the hocl in the solutions was activated by uv light and fe ii which could produce both ho reaction 1 and cl reaction 5 radicals moreover the uv exposure could also lead to the formation of ho from the fe ii under alkaline conditions reaction 7 attributed to the strong oxidative species generated from the fuc process the better performance of fluorescent organic components removal was obtained in comparison with fe ii coagulation the discrepancy between fe ii uv chlorine and fe ii processes for protein like substances removal was observed more significant than humic like components which could be attributed to the activated radicals table 1 in addition ho and cl radicals generated in the fuc process were effective in the decomposition of organic pollutants over a wide mw distribution as well when the mixture contained a high proportion of sa the coagulation with in situ formed fe iii or fe ii alone lacked the ability for fouling control the fe ii uv chlorine oxidation exhibited satisfactory influence in the reduction of membrane foulants due to higher selectivity of cl than ho for electronic moieties in unsaturated bonds some compounds were preferred to be destructed by cl xing et al 2018 simultaneously the cl refractory substances and some other components were decomposed by ho the combination promoted the extensive degradation of the high and low mw organics which was significant to alleviate the cake layer and pore blocking membrane fouling lee et al 2013 as a result of the effective elimination of organic loadings in feed water solutions fe ii uv chlorine also showed satisfactory performance in diminishing accumulated foulants in membrane pores the fluorescent spectra of irreversible foulants suggested the feed water treated by fe ii uv chlorine process caused less hydraulic irreversible fouling in the different mixture especially for the humic like contaminates this could be attributed to that the mw of humic like fractions tended to be lower than that of protein like components it could be seen in fig s2 c that the raw bsa solutions contained a more obvious peak than the ha solutions during earlier retention time while the ha solutions included more and stronger peaks for the low mw components and the small humic like substances preferred to form the pore blocking instead of cake gel foulants henderson et al 2011 the results were consistent with the higher removal efficiency of low mw organics through the strong oxidative species in fe ii uv chlorine oxidation moreover the correlations between fouling indices fi and characteristics of organic fractions provided a promising prediction of the membrane fouling behavior when fe ii uv chlorine was applied the fi was positively correlated with the f max when the three single organic fractions were filtrated fig 9 the value of r2 was over 0 93 for both tfi and hifi in bsa solutions which indicated the eem spectra could be a valid index to predict the fouling formation when protein like solutions were treated by fe ii uv chlorine oxidation poor correlation was found between the doc uv254 and tfi for ha solutions while the values of hifi could be closely related to eem spectra this could provide a supplemental basis for irreversible fouling prediction caused by humic acid besides the fouling indices and organics in mixture solutions were poorly correlated after fe ii uv chlorine process except for the certain correlation between tfi and humic like fluorescent intensities r2 0 6846 therefore although the eem spectra showed positive ability to monitor fouling behavior for the single fraction treated by fe ii uv chlorine and some other feed water it might be not as effective for the complex feed samples after fuc treatment in general it was indicated that the fuc process could be a satisfactory pretreatment for uf membrane it alleviated the membrane fouling induced by various organic fractions and simultaneously improved the water quality meanwhile it should be noticed that these outcomes were achieved depending on typical alternative organics which might differ from the real water resources the various mixture of the organic pollutant was utilized to simulate the diverse water conditions and the fe ii uv chlorine process was proved still valid for reducing membrane fouling which indicated this pretreatment could be an alternative method in water purification additionally this study was performed through a batch lab reactor the derived results might have a discrepancy with continuous operation at a long time and the addition of uv chlorine may raise the operating cost thus further continuous operation and specific cost analysis should be promoted for the full scale application 5 conclusion in this work the performance of fe ii uv chlorine as a pretreatment method prior to uf process was evaluated the fouling mitigation and characteristics of different organic fractions were investigated the following conclusions can be drawn 1 during the filtration of different organic fractions and their mixture the membrane fouling was significantly alleviated by fe ii uv chlorine higher dosage of fe ii and chlorine lead to better effects of fouling mitigation through fe ii uv chlorine treatment the fouling control performance was observed better than coagulation alone at the same dose of iron ions which could be attributed to the oxidation process during fe ii uv chlorine 2 fe ii uv chlorine exhibited similar removal rate of doc and uv254 for different organic fractions compared to single coagulation as the coagulation process played an important role for organic matter removal in the pretreatments the better performance of fluorescent components reduction was obtained by fe ii uv chlorine process fe ii uv chlorine was also effective in degrading a wider mw range of organic pollutants which were responsible for the various forms of membrane fouling 3 the hydraulic irreversible membrane foulants were significantly reduced by fe ii uv chlorine due to the satisfying reduction of low mw contaminants the decreased fouling in membrane pore was positive for long term stable and economic operation the feed water dominated by humic and protein like substances with a minor proportion of polysaccharide achieved great performance on fouling control with fuc process 4 for humic and protein like substances the membrane fouling behavior could be well predicted through fluorescence intensities after the single organic fractions were pretreated by fe ii uv chlorine process whereas the positive correlation was only found between humic r u intensities and tfi during the hsb mixture filtration with fe ii uv chlorine treatment the eem

18447,to address the common challenges in enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr related to stability and unfavorable influent carbon to phosphorus ratio a side stream ebpr s2ebpr process that involves a side stream anaerobic biological sludge hydrolysis and fermentation reactor was proposed as an emerging alternative in this study a full scale pilot testing was performed with side by side operation of a conventional anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2o process versus a s2ebpr process a comparison of the performance activity and microbial community between the two configurations was performed the results demonstrated that with the same influent wastewater characteristics s2ebpr configuration showed improved p removal performance and stability than the conventional a2o configuration especially when the mixers in the side stream anaerobic reactor were operated intermittently mass balance analysis illustrated that both denitrification and ebpr were enhanced in s2ebpr configuration where return activated sludge was diverted into the anaerobic zone to promote fermentation and enrichment of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos and the influent was bypassed to the anoxic zone for enhancing denitrification a relatively higher pao activity and total pao abundance were observed in s2ebpr than in a2o configuration accompanied by a higher degree of dependence on glycolysis pathway than tricarboxylic acid cycle no significant difference in the relative abundances of putative paos including ca accumulibacter and tetrasphaera were observed between the two configurations however higher microbial community diversity indices were observed in s2ebpr configuration than in conventional one in addition consistently lower relative abundance of known glycogen accumulating organisms gaos was observed in s2ebpr system extended anaerobic retention time and conditions that generate continuous and more complex volatile fatty acids in the side stream anaerobic reactor of s2ebpr process likely give more competitive advantage for paos over gaos paos exhibited sustained ebpr activity and delayed decay under extended anaerobic condition likely due to their versatile metabolic pathways depending on the availability and utilization of multiple intracellular polymers this study provided new insights into the effects of implementing side stream ebpr configuration on microbial populations ebpr activity profiles and resulted system performance graphical abstract image 1 keywords ebpr side stream performance comparison microbial ecology activity 1 introduction the anthropogenic discharge of phosphorus p needs to be managed as it will cause undesirable eutrophication and water quality deterioration in receiving waters cordell et al 2009 rittmann et al 2011 enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr is considered a potentially efficient way with economic and environmental advantages compared to traditional chemical p removal in this process typical polyphosphate polyp accumulating organisms paos can anaerobically use the energy and reducing power generated from the hydrolysis of intracellular polyps glycolysis and or tca cycle to assimilate volatile fatty acids vfas and reserve them as poly Î² hydroxyalkanoates phas under the subsequent aerobic anoxic conditions paos utilize the stored phas as energy and carbon sources for biomass growth glycogen replenishment maintenance and polyp synthesis via luxury uptake of inorganic orthophosphate oehmen et al 2007 however ebpr processes often experience fluctuant performance or unpredicted upsets due to weak influent carbon levels excessive nitrate loading nutrient limitation hydraulic shocks i e high rainfall and toxicity barnard and abraham 2006 gu et al 2008 oehmen et al 2007 stephens et al 2004 key operational and environmental factors including influent carbon to phosphorus c p ratio and carbon composition have been shown to affect the efficiency and robustness of ebpr systems and previous studies indicated that influent c p ratio positively correlates with ebpr performance and stability gu et al 2008 neethling et al 2006 randall et al 1998 tetreault et al 1986 external carbon addition via commercially purchased organic chemicals or on site primary sludge fermentation has often been used to stimulate and enhance ebpr for facilities with influent characteristics that are deemed unfavorable randall et al 1997 shen and zhou 2016 tayÃ  et al 2015 however external carbon addition increases the cost and adds carbon footprint to the process and primary sludge fermentation may not be feasible for all cases particularly for facilities with no primary treatment in addition increasingly stringent p limits have forced wastewater treatment plants wwtps to upgrade for establishing more advanced tertiary treatments which implies higher life cycle environmental and health impacts due to the increases in energy and chemical usage rahman et al 2016 2018 these highlight the needs to improve ebpr process performance and stability for achieving sustainable p removal and recovery as an innovative modification and emerging alternative of the conventional ebpr configurations e g ao a2o the side stream ebpr s2ebpr process that involves a side stream anaerobic biological sludge hydrolysis and fermentation reactor was proposed to address the common challenge in ebpr related to weak wastewater influent and to improve process stability vollertsen et al 2006 barnard et al 2017 gu et al 2019 in s2ebpr configurations typically a portion or all of return activated sludge ras or mixed liquor is diverted through a side stream anaerobic reactor then returned to the mainstream anoxic or aerobic zone receiving influent this process can reduce or eliminate the needs for external carbon addition and minimize chemical usage and take advantage of the vfas generated via side stream hydrolysis fermentation of ras or mixed liquor barnard et al 2017 gu et al 2019 the potential advantages of s2ebpr process include improved p removal performance less and no direct dependence on influent carbon loads therefore less susceptibility to fluctuating influent impacts improved denitrification resulting from more influent carbon diversion to anoxic denitrification zones and easy implementation for a variety of existing wwtps configurations barnard et al 2017 gu et al 2019 tooker et al 2017 successful full scale s2ebpr configurations have been demonstrated globally barnard et al 2017 lanham et al 2013a mielczarek et al 2013 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 although comparison between s2ebpr and conventional ebpr plants seems to indicate improved performance lanham et al 2013a onnis hayden et al 2019 the variation of influent characteristics and other environmental and operational factors made the relative comparison difficult for drawing statistically reliable conclusions there have been a few investigations of the difference in both phylogenetic and phenotypic characteristics between conventional ebpr and s2ebpr mielczarek et al 2013 and stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 investigated the putative paos and glycogen accumulating organisms gaos in dozens of danish full scale ebpr plants with or without side stream hydrolysis using fluorescence in situ hybridization fish and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing respectively in those surveys minor differences and no clear trends in the ebpr functionally relevant microbial populations were observed among the two configurations metabolic activities of five ebpr plants in europe were also assessed by lanham et al 2013a the results indicated a possible correlation between s2ebpr configuration and higher level of glycolysis activity however it is not conclusive because the impacts from other important plant specific factors e g influent characteristics could not be isolated and removed furthermore the mechanisms behind s2ebpr process remain mostly unclear recent studies suggested that the side stream anaerobic reactor allows ras fermentation for continuous supply of internal vfas with more complex composition i e acetate propionate butyrate which would potentially provide competitive advantage to paos lÃ³pez vazquez et al 2009 gu et al 2019 oehmen et al 2006 the extended anaerobic condition in the side stream reactor would potentially favor paos over gaos and other ordinary heterotrophic organisms ohos due to their differences in maintenance energy use and sequential utilization of intracellular polymers as well as the differential decay rates between paos and gaos lanham et al 2014 tooker et al 2017 in this study a parallel operation of two independent treatment trains with the same influent feed was performed at the rock creek advanced wastewater treatment facility clean water services hillsboro usa with the goals to compare differences in performance and key microbial populations between s2ebpr and conventional ebpr configurations and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved in s2ebpr process in addition to routine influent and effluent water quality monitoring carbon nitrogen and phosphorus mass balances in situ and ex situ ebpr metabolic activity and kinetics tests and microbial ecology analyses including 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole dapi staining fish and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing were performed to the best of our knowledge this is a first comprehensive side by side investigation of full scale s2ebpr and conventional ebpr configurations that receiving the same influent wastewater this research will improve our fundamental understanding of s2ebpr process the associated microbial community structure and phenotypes and the principal factors that govern the s2ebpr process optimization 2 materials and methods 2 1 full scale wastewater treatment plant and pilot testing the rock creek advanced wastewater treatment facility is located at hillsboro oregon usa which received municipal wastewater at approximately 1 3 105 m3 per day the treatment process consists of primary treatment activated sludge system tertiary phosphorus removal and disinfection full scale pilot testing was conducted from april 26th to august 31st in 2016 in two of the six parallel secondary treatment trains with the same influent feed and tank dimensions and separated secondary clarifiers table s1 one of the two trains was operated in a conventional a2o configuration while the other was operated in a side stream ras fermentation with supplemental carbon ssrc configuration fig 1 in s2ebpr ssrc configuration the anaerobic reactor was separated from mainstream through changing the influent inlet from anaerobic to anoxic zone one hundred percent of ras was diverted into the side stream anaerobic reactor for enhanced sludge hydrolysis and fermentation with additional supplemental carbon from primary sludge fermentate the side stream anaerobic reactor in the s2ebpr ssrc configuration was continuously mixed during phase i a april 26th june 21st during phase i b june 22nd august 31st the mixers in the side stream anaerobic reactor were switched to intermittent operation and cycled on once per 5 7 days for approximately 10 min the mixing frequency was briefly tested at the beginning of phase i b before the tested condition was chosen and more systematic evaluation of the effects of mixing is needed for further studies the specific operational conditions including hydraulic retention time hrt solid retention time srt and flow rate for each configuration during the testing period are summarized in table s2 ebpr performance was monitored routinely during the testing period including total phosphorus tp orthophosphate po4 p total nitrogen

the sampling parameters sites frequency and dates are summarized in table s3 2 2 batch tests two different types of batch tests were carried out in this study to evaluate the ebpr metabolic activity during the pilot testing period p release and uptake batch tests were conducted in accordance with previously described protocol gu et al 2008 briefly fresh activated sludge collected from a2o and s2ebpr configurations were initially aerated for 1 h to remove residual organics sodium acetate was then added to a concentration of 80 mg cod l and the sludge was continuously purged with nitrogen gas to maintain anaerobic conditions after 45 min of anaerobic conditions the sludge was bubbled with air to obtain aerobic conditions for 2 h to simulate the prolonged anaerobic conditions in the side stream reactor and assess the production of internal carbon sources and temporal changes in activities the extended anaerobic batch test was conducted in a simulated reactor using ras from the s2ebpr configuration the batch test was carried out by anaerobically incubating the pre aerated ras without external carbon addition for 36 h all the batch tests were performed in duplicate samples were periodically collected throughout the batch tests to analyze vfas soluble cod scod po4 p nh4 n phas glycogen and vss the reactor ph was maintained at 7 0 0 1 by addition of naoh or hcl dissolved oxygen do was continuously monitored and maintained at less than 0 1 mg l or greater than 2 0 mg l during the anaerobic or aerobic phase respectively temperature was maintained at 20 c throughout the batch tests 2 3 microbial characterization and pao gao quantification in order to investigate the variations of microbial community structure activated sludge samples were collected at the end of the aerobic zone in each configuration before pilot testing as baseline april 7th and april 26th 2016 and during the pilot testing june 22nd july 20th august 2nd august 17th august 30th and october 26th 2016 for 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing genomic dna was extracted using the fast dna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals vista ca usa the extracted dna was sent in triplicate to university of connecticut mars facility for pcr amplification and sequencing targeting the v4 region using the primers 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 and the amplicons were sequenced on the illumina miseq with v2 chemistry using paired end 2 x 250 sequencing the raw fastq files were cleaned using sickle 1 33 with a minimum window quality score of 20 the sequences were trimmed to remove primers and barcodes quality filtered using sickle v1 33 with a minimum quality score of 20 and analyzed as described previously kozich et al 2013 consensus taxonomy of otus was determined using the 80 cutoff using the midas database mcilroy et al 2015 amplicon data was rarefied to the minimum total sequence count 12090 sequences across all samples diversity indices including richness and evenness were calculated for the samples evaluated non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis was performed to determine the relationship between the configuration and the microbial communities an operational taxonomic unit otu level analysis was performed to determine taxa specific to the configurations distribution of otus among the two configurations were categorized as follows i otus that are common to both configurations ii otus that are unique to a2o iii otus that are unique to s2ebpr core community is defined as otus that were greater than 0 1 abundant and present in all samples under consideration all data and statistical analysis were performed in r using the following packages vegan ggplot2 dplyr and ampvis albertsen et al 2015 quantitative fish was used for quantification of specific functionally relevant microbial populations including known paos ca accumulibacter and tetrasphaera and known gaos defluviicoccus ca competibacter and propionivibrio the fraction of these organisms was quantified as a proportion of the total viable cells using a mix of general bacterial probes eubmix the detailed fish protocol and probes were described in the supplementary information and table s4 quantification of population distributions for fish images was carried out using the daime software daims et al 2006 a minimum of 20 random images were analyzed for each sample and the average biovolume was reported dapi staining was also applied to quantify the biovolume of total paos as described previously kawaharasaki et al 1999 2 4

mathworks natick ma usa 3 results 3 1 performance and stability comparison between conventional a2o and s2ebpr configurations the removal efficiencies and performance stability evaluated as cumulative relative frequency of effluent po4 p were compared between a2o and s2ebpr configurations table s5 table s6 fig s1 and fig 2 during phase i a there was no significant difference in performance between a2o and s2ebpr configurations p 0 68 fig 2a the median effluent po4 p concentration of a2o and s2ebpr configurations were 0 24 mg p l and 0 17 mg p l respectively during phase i b the mixers in the side stream anaerobic reactor in s2ebpr configuration were changed to intermittent operation which lead to notably better performance in s2ebpr than the conventional a2o configuration p 0 001 fig 2b the median effluent po4 p concentration in s2ebpr configuration was 0 07 mg p l with 71 of the effluent lower than 0 10 mg p l while the median effluent po4 p concentration in a2o configuration was 0 36 mg p l with only 23 of the effluent less than 0 10 mg p l during the same period the po4 p removal efficiency in s2ebpr configuration increased to 94 while the removal efficiency in a2o configuration was 80 after phase i b there were two large storm events which caused a loss of ebpr performance in both treatment trains fig s1 however the data indicated a higher resistance and faster recovery in the s2ebpr system compared to the conventional system fig s2 the performance of the s2ebpr treatment train was then stable until a subsequent process upset related to another high flow event date not shown 3 2 mass balances of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus 3 2 1 fate of carbon a cod mass balance for both configurations was conducted with the data collected during phase i b table 1 the input cod load which included cod from influent 5890 kg cod d and primary sludge fermentate 1160 kg cod d were similar in both a2o and s2ebpr configurations the effluent cod load was 582 kg cod d in a2o slightly higher than the 566 kg cod d in s2ebpr configuration yielding a cod removal efficiency of 91 8 and 92 0 respectively nutrient requirements for biomass growth were calculated based on the mass of waste activated sludge was and using previously defined stoichiometry wentzel et al 1989a after subtracting p required for biomass growth the p uptake via ebpr was estimated to be 47 kg p d in a2o and 57 kg p d in s2ebpr configuration based on the p uptake calculated in section 3 2 3 the cod consumed for ebpr was therefore estimated to be 318 kg cod d in a2o and 381 kg cod d in s2ebpr configuration the cod used for denitrification was estimated to be 1003 kg cod d in a2o and 1301 kg cod d in s2ebpr configuration based on the no3 n reduction calculated in section 3 2 2 this indicates that the s2ebpr configuration benefited not only paos but also denitrifiers it should also be noted that the mass balance is just based on the apparent cod transformation while additional carbon that may have been internally generated via hydrolysis fermentation in the side stream anaerobic reactor were not included in the calculation 3 2 2 fate of nitrogen a no3 n mass balance for the a2o and s2ebpr configurations during phase i b was conducted as shown in fig s3 in s2ebpr configuration the side stream anaerobic reactor only received no3 n from ras and hence had a lower no3 n load 104 kg n d than the anaerobic zone in a2o configuration 170 kg n d which reduced the carbon demand for denitrification in the side stream reactor and consequently benefitted paos a higher amount of no3 n removal in the anoxic zone of s2ebpr configuration was observed than in the anoxic zone of a2o configuration this was likely because the carbon contained in the influent could be used for denitrification in s2ebpr configuration while carbon was more limited in the anoxic zone of a2o configuration since it was primarily consumed in the preceding anaerobic zone for both ebpr and denitrification the no3 n mass balance showed that the no3 n denitrified in the anoxic zone of s2ebpr configuration was higher than in a2o configuration resulting in an additional no3 n removal of 103 kg n d in the anaerobic and anoxic zones however additional no3 n was produced in the aerobic zone of s2ebpr configuration resulting in a similar effluent no3 n discharge load for both a2o and s2ebpr configurations this additional no3 n production may partially have originated from nh4 n released with the ras hydrolysis fermentation ucisik and henze 2008 and from cell decay lysis lu et al 2007 in the side stream anaerobic reactor especially when the srt was prolonged during phase i b notably the extended anaerobic batch test using ras collected from s2ebpr configuration showed nh4 n release throughout the 36 h testing period section 3 3 2 and so additional nh4 n load to the aerobic zone of s2ebpr configuration could be expected however a profile of nh4 n concentrations was not conducted as part of this study so a more precise quantification of differences in the nh4 n load to the aerobic zones of a2o and s2ebpr configurations could not be performed additional studies to profile nh4 n and organic nitrogen are needed to further validate and understand the impacts of s2ebpr operation on tn removal performance 3 2 3 fate of phosphorus a phosphorus mass balance was calculated for a2o and s2ebpr configurations during phase i b based on measured flow rates and po4 p concentrations in each zone fig 3 the total input p load from influent 93 kg p d and primary sludge fermentate 2 kg p d were similar in a2o and s2ebpr configurations while the effluent po4 p load was lower in s2ebpr 2 6 kg p d than in a2o configuration 8 4 kg p d it was estimated that the average tp mlvss ratio in the was discharged from a2o configuration was 4 4 while it was 5 3 from s2ebpr configuration these ratios ware within the range of typical full scale ebpr facilities lie et al 1997 during phase i a the hrt in the side stream anaerobic reactor of s2ebpr configuration 1 6 h was likely inadequate for hydrolysis fermentation to occur to an appreciable extent which yielded much lower vfa production and p release 34 kg p d the intermittent mixing condition during phase i b in the side stream anaerobic reactor allowed a part of the sludge to settle down creating a thick sludge layer the resulting low oxidation reduction potential orp conditions and likely increased anaerobic retention time enabled sufficient ras hydrolysis fermentation thus leading to more substrate generation and higher p release 73 kg p d given the low amount of external carbon received in the side stream reactor 16 of input cod load compared to the anaerobic zone of a2o configuration the generated substrates would likely make an important contribution to the enhanced p release the p release in a2o configuration occurred mostly in the first anaerobic zone where the influent was fed in the s2ebpr configuration as influent was diverted to the first anoxic zone notable p release occurred and the amount released was nearly as much as in the anaerobic zone phosphorus release in the simultaneous presence of organic matter and no3 n has been reported previously guerrero et al 2011 mino et al 1998 and also been observed in our lab scale ebpr systems data not shown as a result of the combined p release in the anaerobic and first anoxic zone of s2ebpr configuration a greater total p release was observed in s2ebpr configuration during phase i b 132 kg p d from the anaerobic zone plus first anoxic zone compared to the release observed in a2o configuration 106 kg p d only from the anaerobic zone this additional p release was also likely associated with greater substrate uptake from influent plus carbon generated in the side stream reactor which resulted in an increase in the overall p uptake under subsequent anoxic aerobic conditions similar results were obtained with the in situ ebpr process profiles normalized based on the influent flow rate fig s4 fig s5 and table s7 the overall results showed that the intermittent mixing condition in s2ebpr configuration increased the p release and uptake amount further yielding a higher net p removal and removal efficiency up to 97 3 3 ebpr metabolic activity and kinetics assessment 3 3 1 phosphorus release and uptake batch test to evaluate the ebpr metabolic activities of the activated sludge in a2o and s2ebpr configurations a set of p release and uptake batch tests were conducted during phase i b typical ebpr profiles from those tests are shown in fig s6 the p release rates for both a2o and s2ebpr configurations as shown in table 2 were within the range observed for other full scale ebpr facilities brdjanovic et al 2000 gu et al 2008 he et al 2008 kuba et al 1997a 1997b lÃ³pez vÃ¡zquez et al 2008 the activated sludge in s2ebpr configuration showed higher maximum and average p release rate p uptake rate and p uptake to p release ratio than those in a2o configuration table 2 normalized p release rate has previously been used as an indicator with a positive correlation to pao relative abundance he et al 2008 and ebpr activity zilles et al 2002 however it is not necessarily positively correlated with the ebpr performance in practice gu et al 2008 lanham et al 2013a neethling et al 2006 the p release to acetate uptake ratio p hac is treated as an indicator of the relative pao and gao activities and abundances schuler and jenkins 2003 as shown in table 3 the p hac ratio in s2ebpr configuration was 0 45 p mol c mol which indicates presence of gaos in the system smolders et al 1994a in comparison a much lower p hac ratio 0 22 p mol c mol was observed in a2o configuration indicating a more gao like metabolism and or higher relative abundance of gaos which is consistent with our microbial population results section 3 4 1 the anaerobic glycogen utilization to acetate uptake ratios glyc hac for a2o and s2ebpr configurations ranged from 0 14 to 0 23 c mol c mol which were within the range between tricarboxylic acid tca cycle and glycolysis activity as reported in other full scale ebpr facilities gu et al 2008 lanham et al 2013a both in this study and in other reports s2ebpr systems seem to exhibit relatively higher gly hac ratio than conventional ebpr plants which could be related to an increase in the use of glycolysis pathway over tca cycle lanham et al 2013a the preferential use of glycolysis is considered more efficient through production of additional pha per substrate uptake thus potentially beneficial for ebpr smolders et al 1994a the increased reliance on glycolysis and lower relative abundance of gao section 3 4 1 taken together with the higher tp mlvss content indicate that the s2ebpr configuration involves pao dominated metabolism primarily relying on the glycolysis pathway the anaerobic pha generation to acetate uptake ratios pha hac observed in this study were lower than those values predicted in pao and gao models which might be related to the involvement of tetrasphaera and other heterotrophic bacteria that may take up acetate without storing it as pha kristiansen et al 2013 marques et al 2017 according to our fish results section 3 4 1 different clades of tetrasphaera were prevalent throughout the testing period the aerobic p uptake to pha utilization ratio p pha in s2ebpr configuration 0 97 p mol c mol was 3 times higher than that in a2o configuration and it is higher than predicted values for pao model one possible contributing factor is the involvement of other paos such as tetrasphaera that do not rely on pha for p uptake lanham et al 2013a marques et al 2017 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 the p pha ratio in a2o configuration 0 32 p mol c mol was lower than that in the pao model which could be related to a higher relative abundance of gaos observed by both fish and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing section 3 4 1 3 3 2 extended anaerobic batch test to evaluate the temporal changes in vfa generation and ebpr activity in the side stream anaerobic reactor an extended anaerobic batch test without supplemental carbon addition was conducted using the ras collected from s2ebpr configuration as shown in fig 4 the majority of p release pha production and glycogen utilization were concurrent during the first 18 h of the anaerobic batch test indicating a typical ebpr activity little or no residual vfas and scod were detected during the first 18 h fig 4a which is likely because the substrates generated slowly via sludge fermentation were immediately consumed stored a higher phv phb production ratio than typical range smolders et al 1994a zeng et al 2003 was detected during the first 18 h of the batch test fig 4b reflecting a more complex vfa composition in the generated substrate than those in the conventional wastewater influent the in situ vfa generation with more diverse composition along with the resulted high intracellular pha accumulition during the prolonged anaerobic conditions could potentially favor selection of paos over gaos after 18 h of anaerobic incubation the p release pha production and glycogen utilization ceased while increased scod and vfa generation rates were observed it is hypothesized that paos gaos might have depleted the polyp glycogen pools and or achieved the maximum pha pool thus potentially transitioned from active ebpr metabolism to maintenance oriented metabolism a constant nh4 n release rate was also observed throughout the batch test which was consistent with the level expected for endogenous decay henze et al 2001 previous studies observed that under the extended anaerobic condition without carbon addition the decay rate for accumulibacter paos was lower or negligible compared to gaos carvalheira et al 2014 lu et al 2007 it is speculated that the elastic biochemical pathways depending on the availability and sequential utilization of intracellular polymers polyp and glycogen for paos glycogen only for gaos allows paos to delay the depletion of energy reservoirs under the extended starvation conditions and thus remain longer than gaos before the on set of decay gu et al 2019 nielsen et al 2014 there may be an optimum hrt srt in the side stream anaerobic reactor to maximize the active p release and pha storage of paos for subsequent p uptake and to enrich paos and de select gaos for enhanced carbon utilization efficiency in the full scale s2ebpr plants 3 4 microbial population dynamics and community analysis 3 4 1 functionally relevant populations paos and gaos in order to observe the presence and relative abundance of total paos during the full scale pilot testing dapi staining that targeting intracellular polyp granules was applied to the sludge samples collected at the end of the aerobic zone in each configuration as shown in fig 5 a the total abundance of dapi positive paos changed over the testing time with a higher average abundance in s2ebpr 12 9 4 8 than in a2o configuration 9 1 3 2 p 0 05 indicating a relatively higher polyp accumulating capacity regarding accumulibacter paos both fish and amplicon sequencing results showed comparable relative abundances in a2o and s2ebpr configurations with gradually increasing trends during phase i b fig 5b fig s7 although no significant difference in the accumulibacter abundance between s2ebpr and conventional a2o configuration finer resolution evaluation of the micro diversity of accumulibacter using oligotyping approach indicated distinct accumulibacter sub clades between the two configurations unpublished data after phase i b a decrease in the relative abundance of accumulibacter occurred data not shown as a result of unsteady state conditions caused by the storm events given that the total abundance of dapi positive paos was higher in s2ebpr than in a2o configuration while the relative abundance of known accumulibacter did not show significant differences between two configurations it implies that there are other non accumulibacter paos in the systems these non accumulibacter paos are likely in greater abundance in s2ebpr than in a2o configuration consequently there are multiple factors such as microbial structure and phylogenetic difference pao phenotypic diversity and elasticity and shift in metabolic pathways that could have led to the observed differences in ebpr performance tetrasphaera another important group of putative paos capable of fermentation were detected by fish in a higher relative abundance ranging from 10 7 to 20 7 than accumulibacter fig 5c which is consistent with previous reports on full scale ebpr systems lanham et al 2013a the relative abundance of tetrasphaera in a2o and s2ebpr configurations were comparable during phase i b 15 6 three tetrasphaera related clades including clade 1 clade 2a and clade 3 were dominant in the samples at similar fractions however our amplicon sequencing results showed the average relative abundance of tetrasphaera were only 0 07 which is orders of magnitude lower than the results obtained from the other amplicon based studies on full scale ebpr plants stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 possible explanations for this discrepancy include dna extraction biases against gram positive organism pcr biases variation in the number of 16s rrna gene copies across different organisms the presence of legacy dna from non active organisms albertsen et al 2015 meanwhile the biovolume of fish probe defined tetrasphaera may also be overestimated due to the filamentous morphology of some tetrasphaera species nguyen et al 2011 nevertheless the overall results suggest tetrasphaera or other non accumulibacter paos existed in s2ebpr configuration and potentially contributed for ebpr further studies are warranted to better understand the coexistence and synergy between accumulibacter and tetrasphaera in s2ebpr systems fish targeted gaos were present in much lower relative abundance than paos in both a2o and s2ebpr configurations ranging from 0 6 to 5 2 fig 5d defluviicoccus cluster i and propionivibrio were the most frequently observed gaos which is consistent with the trends of amplicon sequencing results fig s8 although few known gaos were detected in either system the gao abundance in a2o configuration was always greater than in s2ebpr configuration by both fish and amplicon sequencing it should also be noted that an obvious increase in the gao population was observed in the a2o configuration at the end of phase i b especially defluviicoccus cluster i and ca competibacter many studies have demonstrated that both defluviicoccus and competibacter gaos are capable of competing with paos for uptake of either acetate or propionate under anaerobic conditions crocetti et al 2002 dai et al 2007 oehmen et al 2005 which could have contributed to the observed inferior ebpr activity and less stable performance in a2o configuration than that in s2ebpr during phase i b 3 4 2 microbial community structure and diversity higher resolution phylogenetic comparison of the microbial community structures between a2o and s2ebpr configurations were further investigated with 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing during phase i b members of the class betaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria including the genus haliangium comamonadaceae and zoogloea were dominant in both configurations fig 6 which have also been observed in the other full scale ebpr facilities mcilroy et al 2016 onnis hayden et al 2019 zhang et al 2012 there were a total of 57 otus that were common between the two configurations fig s9 otus that were classified as rhodocyclaceae xanthomonadaceae and comamonadaceae were the most abundant of the common core otus and included ca accumulibacter otu00015 of the core community in each of the configurations 14 otus were exclusively present in the a2o community while s2ebpr had 35 otus there were exclusively present this suggests that s2ebpr gave rise to more unique otus that were exclusively part of its core community some of the most abundant otus exclusive to s2ebpr were classified as nannocystaceae moraxellaceae haliangiaceae rhodocyclaceae and nitrospiraceae organisms in the rhodocyclaceae and nitrospiraceae families are known to be involved in p and n removal processes and could be important to the biological nutrient removal bnr processes he and mcmahon 2011 daims et al 2001 as discussed previously due to the variety of environmental factors including plant specific wastewater influent it is usually very difficult to compare and associate the observed community diversities across different wwtps with certain specific factors the pilot testing performed at the rock creek facility provided a unique opportunity to observe the effect of the configuration since the operational environment e g climate and wastewater influent were the same to both treatment trains nmds analysis of the time series samples showed that the two configurations had similar initial microbial communities before the pilot testing fig 7 a during phase i b the communities in a2o and s2ebpr configurations diverged as they became acclimated to the different configurations and associated operational conditions a comparison between the two configurations at each sampling date revealed clear time and configuration dependent separation of microbial communities indicating a distinct community composition in s2ebpr configuration after phase i b with the heavy precipitation events however the communities in a2o and s2ebpr configurations converged and accompanying performance fluctuations were observed microbial diversity in terms of observed otu numbers chao1 pielou evenness shannon and inverse simpson indices for each sample was summarized in table s8 and fig 7b during the pilot testing shannon and inverse simpson diversity indices observed in the s2ebpr configuration was higher than in a2o configuration p 0 05 fig 7b richness and evenness evaluation of the microbial communities revealed a more diverse microbial community in s2ebpr configuration compared to conventional a2o configuration implying that it could show better resilience to perturbations due to potential redundancy and complementation in functions lawson et al 2015 4 discussion 4 1 simultaneous sludge fermentation and ebpr activity our full scale measuremnts and mass balance evalutaion showed that the side stream configuration would allow simultaneous sludge fermenation for substrate production and ebpr activities it has also been observed in the ras hydrolysis reactor jÃ¶nsson and jansen 2006 vollertsen et al 2006 and anaerobic digester bi et al 2013 that ebpr sludge fermentation and active p release by paos could occur simultaneously to confirm the role of sludge hydrolysis and fermentation we also conducted an extended anaerobic batch test to simulate the conditions in the side stream anaerobic reactor which provides detailed information including concentrations of cod n p and vfa in a time series the results as shown in section 3 3 2 indicated that the ebpr activity e g enhanced p release and pha production is associated with substrates e g scod vfas generated via ras hydrolysis fermentation a key feature of s2ebpr ssrc process is a longer anaerobic retention time than that in the conventional anaerobic zone in our study because of shifting influent flow from anaerobic zone to anoxic zone in s2ebpr configuration only primary sludge fermentate and ras entered the side stream reactor which resulted in a relatively longer anaerobic hrt 1 6 2 1 h compared to that in a2o configuration 0 6 0 8 h additionally during phase i b when the mixers in the side stream reactor were operated intermittently the anaerobic srt was decoupled with hrt and extended to a considerable long time as hydrolysis fermentation is one of the rate limiting steps an extended contact reaction time in the side stream anaerobic reactor with low orp would therefore benefit the fermentative organisms to break down complex carbon compounds into vfas and facilitating vfa uptake and pha storage by paos as indicated in the batch test under the prolonged anaerobic condition in the side stream reactor where fermentation occurs paos would continue to accumulate pha i e up to 18 h as long as there are vfa generation from the fermentation and it plateaus presumably as the energy source e g intracellular polyp is exhausted recently tetrasphaera has been found as an abundant pao in full scale and lab scale ebpr systems with capabilities of fermenting diverse carbon sources including sugars amino acids and starch fernando et al 2019 marques et al 2017 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 and adapting to the changing environmental conditions herbst et al 2019 liu et al 2019 it was hypothesized that in the side stream anaerobic reactor with limited external organics the fermentative paos e g tetrasphaera and or the other hydrolysers fermenters may flourish and play crucial roles in the process of ras hydrolysis fermentation fernando et al 2019 nielsen et al 2019 the classical paos e g accumulibacter may then take up the fermentation products e g acetate or propionate for pha storage as confirmed in our study and also evidenced by the other studies nielsen et al 2019 meanwhile both fermentative and classical paos would degrade polyp for their anaerobic energy requirements leading to the simultaneous sludge fermentation and ebpr activity in the side stream reactor 4 2 influent independent carbon sources and c p ratio paos have the ability to take up excess phosphate to produce intracellular polyp which relies on the anaerobic storage of intracellular metabolites e g pha for ca accumulibacter glycogen or other internal storage products for tetrasphaera from utilization of carbon kristiansen et al 2013 mino et al 1998 smolders et al 1994a wentzel et al 1989b therefore sufficient and stable carbon supply are critical for successful ebpr processes conventional ebpr process e g a2o relies directly on the influent carbon vfas which often fluctuates as shown in fig s10 in s2ebpr ssrc configuration the vfa sources for pao enrichment in the side stream anaerobic reactor come from ras fermentation and or additional primary sludge fermentate which provide influent independent and more stable and continuous vfa supply previous studies indicated that the vfa feeding level and strategy impact the microbial population competition broughton et al 2008 tu and schuler 2013 c p ratio has been correlated with ebpr performance gu et al 2008 and the minimum readily biodegradable cod rbcod to p ratio for satisfying p removal in wwtps was recommended as 15 1 25 1 gu et al 2008 randall et al 1998 tetreault et al 1986 oehmen et al 2007 pointed out that a cod p ratio greater than 50 1 tends to favor growth of gaos and recommended a lower cod p ratio ranging from 10 1 20 1 the theoretical vfa requirement for p removal has been proposed to be greater than 8 1 schuler and jenkins 2003 table s9 summarizes the cod p and vfa p ratios in the influent during this pilot study even though high cod tp 72 1 and cod po4 p 80 1 ratios were observed in the influent the vfa p ratio was low 5 1 additional carbon from primary sludge fermentate was added thus increasing the vfa po4 p ratio from 5 1 to 10 1 table s10 in s2ebpr configuration extra carbon sources would be generated via ras fermentation especially during phase i b when the intermittent mixing was implemented in the side stream anaerobic reactor to decouple the srt from hrt for promoting more fermentation based on the carbon and nutrient mass balances and measured p hac ratio in the ex situ batch test it was estimated that 180 kg cod d of vfas could be generated continuously via ras fermentation in the side stream reactor the simulated ras fermentation batch test also showed notable vfa production fig 4 in summary both the influent c p ratios and the sustained steady vfa feeding associated with ras fermentation in the side stream reactor should be considered as impact factors on s2ebpr performance and prevalence of paos this would directly impact pha accumulation along with p release in the anaerobic zones thus affecting p uptake in the downstream aerobic zone the optimum proportion of ras diversion and conditions in the side stream reactor for s2ebpr still need further investigation 4 3 impacts of vfa composition in addition to the c p ratio and carbon input different available carbon sources e g vfas glucose amino acids etc could also have impacts on the pao gao competition in ebpr lÃ³pez vazquez et al 2009 the vfa compositions in influent and primary sludge fermentate are shown in fig s11 the proportion of propionate in primary sludge fermentate 35 was higher than in influent 24 p 0 001 the relative proportions of vfas in primary sludge fermentate were also more consistent than those measured in influent previous studies indicated that vfa uptake rates of accumulibacter paos were similar using either acetate or propionate as carbon source while different groups of gaos seem to have preferences for various carbon sources dai et al 2007 oehmen et al 2006 shen and zhou 2016 therefore vfa feeding strategies such as switching use of acetate propionate lu et al 2006 feeding a combination of acetate and propionate lÃ³pez vazquez et al 2009 dosing slowly and continuously tu and schuler 2013 and propionate feeding under different c p ratios broughton et al 2008 were found to favor lab scale reactors with ca accumulibacter over gaos for full scale wttps such strategies might not always be feasible due to infrastructure limitation and diurnal and seasonal variability of influent however the s2ebpr process enables flexibility to implement the above mentioned strategies such as continuous and slow vfa feeding through ras fermentation more complex vfa composition with a relatively higher proportion of propionate over acetate therefore the conditions in the s2ebpr process could potentially provide a competitive advantage to paos over gaos 4 4 competition among key functionally relevant populations in addition to the enhancement of fermentation for vfa production in the side stream anaerobic rector with longer anaerobic retention time it was previously observed that accumulibacter related paos are able to maintain acetate uptake activity under extended anaerobic conditions 12 h while competibacter related gaos are either unable to maintain activity or cannot survive without external substrate addition nielsen et al 2014 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2015 agent based modeling of pao and gao competition under extended anaerobic conditions indicated that staged maintenance and decay and sequential utilization of intracellular polymers are the underlying biochemical processes for above observations li et al 2018 gu et al 2019 this has been attributed to the biochemical pathway shifts depending on the availability of various intracellular polymers polyp glycogen phas differential polymer utilization and energy requirements for maintenance and decay rates in paos and gaos hao et al 2010 lÃ³pez vÃ¡zquez et al 2008 lu et al 2007 da silva et al 2018 moreover tetrasphaera type paos capable of fermenting different organic substrates would also benefit from the conditions in the side stream anaerobic reactor therefore the extended anaerobic condition likely leads to more decay of gaos and other ohos while paos gain a competitive advantage due to its ability to sustain longer with multiple intracellular polymers as energy reservoirs and more versatile biochemical pathways under changing environmental conditions herbst et al 2019 li et al 2018 although not the focus of this study a reduced daily sludge production was observed in the s2ebpr configuration with 6 reduction compared to the conventional a2o configuration which is possibly attributed to the side stream anaerobic sludge hydrolysis fermentation reactor indicating its potential contributions to sludge treatment chon et al 2011 ferrentino et al 2016 5 conclusions a comparative full scale pilot testing with side by side operation of an s2ebpr configuration ssrc process and a conventional ebpr configuration a2o process was conducted the following conclusions are obtained with the same influent wastewater characteristics s2ebpr configuration had more effective and stable p removal performance especially when the mixers in the side stream anaerobic reactor were operated intermittently both p removal and denitrification were enhanced through diverting influent to anoxic zone and producing additional carbon via ras fermentation higher microbial community diversity indices and lower relative abundance of known gaos were observed in s2ebpr configuration relatively higher pao activity and increased level of glycolysis activity were observed in s2ebpr configuration than those in the conventional a2o process adequate anaerobic retention time and conditions that allow continuous supply of more complex vfas via ras fermentation potentially provide competitive advantage to paos over gaos further studies related to optimization of side stream reactor conditions such as orp srt hrt mixing conditions and percent of ras diversion are required for better process design and operation a more in depth and higher resolution investigation of microbial ecology at finer resolution and corresponding characterization of phenotypic traits are also suggested to reveal the micro diversity of functionally relevant organisms for better understand the fundamental

18447,to address the common challenges in enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr related to stability and unfavorable influent carbon to phosphorus ratio a side stream ebpr s2ebpr process that involves a side stream anaerobic biological sludge hydrolysis and fermentation reactor was proposed as an emerging alternative in this study a full scale pilot testing was performed with side by side operation of a conventional anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2o process versus a s2ebpr process a comparison of the performance activity and microbial community between the two configurations was performed the results demonstrated that with the same influent wastewater characteristics s2ebpr configuration showed improved p removal performance and stability than the conventional a2o configuration especially when the mixers in the side stream anaerobic reactor were operated intermittently mass balance analysis illustrated that both denitrification and ebpr were enhanced in s2ebpr configuration where return activated sludge was diverted into the anaerobic zone to promote fermentation and enrichment of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos and the influent was bypassed to the anoxic zone for enhancing denitrification a relatively higher pao activity and total pao abundance were observed in s2ebpr than in a2o configuration accompanied by a higher degree of dependence on glycolysis pathway than tricarboxylic acid cycle no significant difference in the relative abundances of putative paos including ca accumulibacter and tetrasphaera were observed between the two configurations however higher microbial community diversity indices were observed in s2ebpr configuration than in conventional one in addition consistently lower relative abundance of known glycogen accumulating organisms gaos was observed in s2ebpr system extended anaerobic retention time and conditions that generate continuous and more complex volatile fatty acids in the side stream anaerobic reactor of s2ebpr process likely give more competitive advantage for paos over gaos paos exhibited sustained ebpr activity and delayed decay under extended anaerobic condition likely due to their versatile metabolic pathways depending on the availability and utilization of multiple intracellular polymers this study provided new insights into the effects of implementing side stream ebpr configuration on microbial populations ebpr activity profiles and resulted system performance graphical abstract image 1 keywords ebpr side stream performance comparison microbial ecology activity 1 introduction the anthropogenic discharge of phosphorus p needs to be managed as it will cause undesirable eutrophication and water quality deterioration in receiving waters cordell et al 2009 rittmann et al 2011 enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr is considered a potentially efficient way with economic and environmental advantages compared to traditional chemical p removal in this process typical

stephens et al 2004 key operational and environmental factors including influent carbon to phosphorus c p ratio and carbon composition have been shown to affect the efficiency and robustness of ebpr systems and previous studies indicated that influent c p ratio positively correlates with ebpr performance and stability gu et al 2008 neethling et al 2006 randall et al 1998 tetreault et al 1986 external carbon addition via commercially purchased organic chemicals or on site primary sludge fermentation has often been used to stimulate and enhance ebpr for facilities with influent characteristics that are deemed unfavorable randall et al 1997 shen and zhou 2016 tayÃ  et al 2015 however external carbon addition increases the cost and adds carbon footprint to the process and primary sludge fermentation may not be feasible for all cases particularly for facilities with no primary treatment in addition increasingly stringent p limits have forced wastewater treatment plants wwtps to upgrade for establishing more advanced tertiary treatments which implies higher life cycle environmental and health impacts due to the increases in energy and chemical usage rahman et al 2016 2018 these highlight the needs to improve ebpr process performance and stability for achieving sustainable p removal and recovery as an innovative modification and emerging alternative of the conventional ebpr configurations e g ao a2o the side stream ebpr s2ebpr process that involves a side stream anaerobic biological sludge hydrolysis and fermentation reactor was proposed to address the common challenge in ebpr related to weak wastewater influent and to improve process stability vollertsen et al 2006 barnard et al 2017 gu et al 2019 in s2ebpr configurations typically a portion or all of return activated sludge ras or mixed liquor is diverted through a side stream anaerobic reactor then returned to the mainstream anoxic or aerobic zone receiving influent this process can reduce or eliminate the needs for external carbon addition and minimize chemical usage and take advantage of the vfas generated via side stream hydrolysis fermentation of ras or mixed liquor barnard et al 2017 gu et al 2019 the potential advantages of s2ebpr process include improved p removal performance less and no direct dependence on influent carbon loads therefore less susceptibility to fluctuating influent impacts improved denitrification resulting from more influent carbon diversion to anoxic denitrification zones and easy implementation for a variety of existing wwtps configurations barnard et al 2017 gu et al 2019 tooker et al 2017 successful full scale s2ebpr configurations have been demonstrated globally barnard et al 2017 lanham et al 2013a mielczarek et al 2013 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 although comparison between s2ebpr and conventional ebpr plants seems to indicate improved performance lanham et al 2013a onnis hayden et al 2019 the variation of influent characteristics and other environmental and operational factors made the relative comparison difficult for drawing statistically reliable conclusions there have been a few investigations of the difference in both phylogenetic and phenotypic characteristics between conventional ebpr and s2ebpr mielczarek et al 2013 and stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 investigated the putative paos and glycogen accumulating organisms gaos in dozens of danish full scale ebpr plants with or without side stream hydrolysis using fluorescence in situ hybridization fish and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing respectively in those surveys minor differences and no clear trends in the ebpr functionally relevant microbial populations were observed among the two configurations metabolic activities of five ebpr plants in europe were also assessed by lanham et al 2013a the results indicated a possible correlation between s2ebpr configuration and higher level of glycolysis activity however it is not conclusive because the impacts from other important plant specific factors e g influent characteristics could not be isolated and removed furthermore the mechanisms behind s2ebpr process remain mostly unclear recent studies suggested that the side stream anaerobic reactor allows ras fermentation for continuous supply of internal vfas with more complex composition i e acetate propionate butyrate which would potentially provide competitive advantage to paos lÃ³pez vazquez et al 2009 gu et al 2019 oehmen et al 2006 the extended anaerobic condition in the side stream reactor would potentially favor paos over gaos and other ordinary heterotrophic organisms ohos due to their differences in maintenance energy use and sequential utilization of intracellular polymers as well as the differential decay rates between paos and gaos lanham et al 2014 tooker et al 2017 in this study a parallel operation of two independent treatment trains with the same influent feed was performed at the rock creek advanced wastewater treatment facility clean water services hillsboro usa with the goals to compare differences in performance and key microbial populations between s2ebpr and conventional ebpr configurations and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved in s2ebpr process in addition to routine influent and effluent water quality monitoring carbon nitrogen and phosphorus mass balances in situ and ex situ ebpr metabolic activity and kinetics tests and microbial ecology analyses including 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole dapi staining fish and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing were performed to the best of our knowledge this is a first comprehensive side by side investigation of full scale s2ebpr and conventional ebpr configurations that receiving the same influent wastewater this research will improve our fundamental understanding of s2ebpr process the associated microbial community structure and phenotypes and the principal factors that govern the s2ebpr process optimization 2 materials and methods 2 1 full scale wastewater treatment plant and pilot testing the rock creek advanced wastewater treatment facility is located at hillsboro oregon usa which received municipal wastewater at approximately 1 3 105 m3 per day the treatment process consists of primary treatment activated sludge system tertiary phosphorus removal and disinfection full scale pilot testing was conducted from april 26th to august 31st in 2016 in two of the six parallel secondary treatment trains with the same influent feed and tank dimensions and separated secondary clarifiers table s1 one of the two trains was operated in a conventional a2o configuration while the other was operated in a side stream ras fermentation with supplemental carbon ssrc configuration fig 1 in s2ebpr ssrc configuration the anaerobic reactor was separated from mainstream through changing the influent inlet from anaerobic to anoxic zone one hundred percent of ras was diverted into the side stream anaerobic reactor for enhanced sludge hydrolysis and fermentation with additional supplemental carbon from primary sludge fermentate the side stream anaerobic reactor in the s2ebpr ssrc configuration was continuously mixed during phase i a april 26th june 21st during phase i b june 22nd august 31st the mixers in the side stream anaerobic reactor were switched to intermittent operation and cycled on once per 5 7 days for approximately 10 min the mixing frequency was briefly tested at the beginning of phase i b before the tested condition was chosen and more systematic evaluation of the effects of mixing is needed for further studies the specific operational conditions including hydraulic retention time hrt solid retention time srt and flow rate for each

the sampling parameters sites frequency and dates are summarized in table s3 2 2 batch tests two different types of batch tests were carried out in this study to evaluate the ebpr metabolic activity during the pilot testing period p release and uptake batch tests were conducted in accordance with previously described protocol gu et al 2008 briefly fresh activated sludge collected from a2o and s2ebpr configurations were initially aerated for 1 h to remove residual organics sodium acetate was then added to a concentration of 80 mg cod l and the sludge was continuously purged with nitrogen gas to maintain anaerobic conditions after 45 min of anaerobic conditions the sludge was bubbled with air to obtain aerobic conditions for 2 h to simulate the prolonged anaerobic conditions in the side stream reactor and assess the production of internal carbon sources and temporal changes in activities the extended anaerobic batch test was conducted in a simulated reactor using ras from the s2ebpr configuration the batch test was carried out by anaerobically incubating the pre aerated ras without external carbon addition for 36 h all the batch tests were performed in duplicate samples were periodically collected throughout the batch tests to analyze vfas soluble cod scod po4 p nh4 n phas glycogen and vss the reactor ph was maintained at 7 0 0 1 by addition of naoh or hcl dissolved oxygen do was continuously monitored and maintained at less than 0 1 mg l or greater than 2 0 mg l during the anaerobic or aerobic phase respectively temperature was maintained at 20 c throughout the batch tests 2 3 microbial characterization and pao gao quantification in order to investigate the variations of microbial community structure activated sludge samples were collected at the end of the aerobic zone in each configuration before pilot testing as baseline april 7th and april 26th 2016 and during the pilot testing june 22nd july 20th august 2nd august 17th august 30th and october 26th

connecticut mars facility for pcr amplification and sequencing targeting the v4 region using the primers 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 and the amplicons were sequenced on the illumina miseq with v2 chemistry using paired end 2 x 250 sequencing the raw fastq files were cleaned using sickle 1 33 with a minimum window quality score of 20 the sequences were trimmed to remove primers and barcodes quality filtered using sickle v1 33 with a minimum quality score of 20 and analyzed as described previously kozich et al 2013 consensus taxonomy of otus was determined using the 80 cutoff using the midas database mcilroy et al 2015 amplicon data was rarefied to the minimum total sequence count 12090 sequences across all samples diversity indices including richness and evenness were calculated for the samples evaluated non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis was performed to determine the relationship between the configuration and the microbial communities an operational taxonomic unit otu level analysis was performed to determine taxa specific to the configurations distribution of otus among the two configurations were categorized as follows i otus that are common to both configurations ii otus that are unique to a2o iii otus that are unique to s2ebpr core community is defined as otus that were greater than 0 1 abundant and present in all samples under consideration all data and statistical analysis were performed in r using the following packages vegan ggplot2 dplyr and ampvis albertsen et al 2015 quantitative fish was used for quantification of specific functionally relevant microbial populations including known paos ca accumulibacter and tetrasphaera and known gaos defluviicoccus ca competibacter and propionivibrio the fraction of these organisms was quantified as a proportion of the total viable cells using a mix of general bacterial probes eubmix the detailed fish protocol and probes were described in the supplementary information and table s4 quantification of population distributions for fish images was carried out using the daime software daims et al 2006 a minimum of 20 random images were analyzed for each sample and the average biovolume was reported dapi staining was also applied to quantify the biovolume of total paos as described previously kawaharasaki et al 1999 2 4

mathworks natick ma usa 3 results 3 1 performance and stability comparison between conventional a2o and s2ebpr configurations the removal efficiencies and performance stability evaluated as cumulative relative frequency of effluent po4 p were compared between a2o and s2ebpr configurations table s5 table s6 fig s1 and fig 2 during phase i a there was no significant difference in performance between a2o and s2ebpr configurations p 0 68 fig 2a the median effluent po4 p concentration of a2o and s2ebpr configurations were 0 24 mg p l and 0 17 mg p l respectively during phase i b the mixers in the side stream anaerobic reactor in s2ebpr configuration were changed to intermittent operation which lead to notably better performance in s2ebpr than the conventional a2o configuration p 0 001 fig 2b the median effluent po4 p concentration in s2ebpr configuration was 0 07 mg p l with 71 of the effluent lower than 0 10 mg p l while the median effluent po4 p concentration in a2o configuration was 0 36 mg p l with only 23 of the effluent less than 0 10 mg p l during the same period the po4 p removal efficiency in s2ebpr configuration increased to 94 while the removal efficiency in a2o configuration was 80 after phase i b there were two large storm events which caused a loss of ebpr performance in both treatment trains fig s1 however the data indicated a higher resistance and faster recovery in the s2ebpr system compared to the conventional system fig s2 the performance of the s2ebpr treatment train was then stable until a subsequent process upset related to another high flow event date not shown 3 2 mass balances of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus 3 2 1 fate of carbon a cod mass balance for both configurations was conducted with the data collected during phase i b table 1 the input cod load which included cod from influent 5890 kg cod d and primary sludge fermentate 1160 kg cod d were similar in both a2o and s2ebpr configurations the effluent cod load was 582 kg cod d in a2o slightly higher than the 566 kg cod d in s2ebpr configuration yielding a cod removal efficiency of 91 8 and 92 0 respectively nutrient requirements for biomass growth were calculated based on the mass of waste activated sludge was and using previously defined stoichiometry wentzel et al 1989a after subtracting p required for biomass growth the p uptake via ebpr was estimated to be 47 kg p d in a2o and 57 kg p d in s2ebpr configuration based on the p uptake calculated in section 3 2 3 the cod consumed for ebpr was therefore estimated to be 318 kg cod d in a2o and 381 kg cod d in s2ebpr configuration the cod used for denitrification was estimated to be 1003 kg cod d in a2o and 1301 kg cod d in s2ebpr configuration based on the no3 n reduction calculated in section 3 2 2 this indicates that the s2ebpr configuration benefited not only paos but also denitrifiers it should also be noted that the mass balance is just based on the apparent cod transformation while additional carbon that may have been internally generated via hydrolysis fermentation in the side stream anaerobic reactor were not included in the calculation 3 2 2 fate of nitrogen a no3 n mass balance for the a2o and s2ebpr configurations during phase i b was conducted as shown in fig s3 in s2ebpr configuration the side stream anaerobic reactor only received no3 n from ras and hence had a lower no3 n load 104 kg n d than the anaerobic zone in a2o configuration 170 kg n d which reduced the carbon demand for denitrification in the side stream reactor and consequently benefitted paos a higher amount of no3 n removal in the anoxic zone of s2ebpr configuration was observed than in the anoxic zone of a2o configuration this was likely because the carbon contained in the influent could be used for denitrification in s2ebpr configuration while carbon was more limited in the anoxic zone of a2o configuration since it was primarily consumed in the preceding anaerobic zone for both ebpr and denitrification the no3 n mass balance showed that the no3 n denitrified in the anoxic zone of s2ebpr configuration was higher than in a2o configuration resulting in an additional no3 n removal of 103 kg n d in the anaerobic and anoxic zones however additional no3 n was produced in the aerobic zone of s2ebpr configuration resulting in a similar effluent no3 n discharge load for both a2o and s2ebpr configurations this additional no3 n production may partially have originated from nh4 n released with the ras hydrolysis fermentation ucisik and henze 2008 and from cell decay lysis lu et al 2007 in the side stream anaerobic reactor especially when the srt was prolonged during phase i b notably the extended anaerobic batch test using ras collected from s2ebpr configuration showed nh4 n release throughout the 36 h testing period section 3 3 2 and so additional nh4 n load to the aerobic zone of s2ebpr configuration could be expected however a profile of nh4 n concentrations was not conducted as part of this study so a more precise quantification of differences in the nh4 n load to the aerobic zones of a2o and s2ebpr configurations could not be performed additional studies to profile nh4 n and organic nitrogen are needed to further validate and understand the impacts of s2ebpr operation on tn removal performance 3 2 3 fate of phosphorus a phosphorus mass balance was calculated for a2o and s2ebpr configurations during phase i b based on measured flow rates and po4 p concentrations in each zone fig 3 the total input p load from influent 93 kg p d and primary sludge fermentate 2 kg p d were similar in a2o and s2ebpr configurations while the effluent po4 p load was lower in s2ebpr 2 6 kg p d than in a2o configuration 8 4 kg p d it was estimated that the average tp mlvss ratio in the was discharged from a2o configuration was 4 4 while it was 5 3 from s2ebpr configuration these ratios ware within the range of typical full scale ebpr facilities lie et al 1997 during phase i a the hrt in the side stream anaerobic reactor of s2ebpr configuration 1 6 h was likely inadequate for hydrolysis fermentation to occur to an appreciable extent which yielded much lower vfa production and p release 34 kg p d the intermittent mixing condition during phase i b in the side stream anaerobic reactor allowed a part of the sludge to settle down creating a thick sludge layer the resulting low oxidation reduction potential orp conditions and likely increased anaerobic retention time enabled sufficient ras hydrolysis fermentation thus leading to more substrate generation and higher p release 73 kg p d given the low amount of external carbon received in the side stream reactor 16 of input cod load compared to the anaerobic zone of a2o configuration the generated substrates would likely make an important contribution to the enhanced p release the p release in a2o configuration occurred mostly in the first anaerobic zone where the influent was fed in the s2ebpr configuration as influent was diverted to the first anoxic zone notable p release occurred and the amount released was nearly as much as in the anaerobic zone phosphorus release in the simultaneous presence of organic matter and no3 n has been reported previously guerrero et al 2011 mino et al 1998 and also been observed in our lab scale ebpr systems data not shown as a result of the combined p release in the anaerobic and first anoxic zone of s2ebpr configuration a greater total p release was observed in s2ebpr configuration during phase i b 132 kg p d from the anaerobic zone plus first anoxic zone compared to the release observed in a2o configuration 106 kg p d only from the anaerobic zone this additional p release was also likely associated with greater substrate uptake from influent plus carbon generated in the side stream reactor which resulted in an increase in the overall p uptake under subsequent anoxic aerobic conditions similar results were obtained with the in situ ebpr process profiles normalized based on the influent flow rate fig s4 fig s5 and table s7 the overall results showed that the intermittent mixing condition in s2ebpr configuration increased the p release and uptake amount further yielding a higher net p removal and removal efficiency up to 97 3 3 ebpr metabolic activity and kinetics assessment 3 3 1 phosphorus release and uptake batch test to evaluate the ebpr metabolic activities of the activated sludge in a2o and s2ebpr configurations a set of p release and uptake batch tests were conducted during phase i b typical ebpr profiles from those tests are shown in fig s6 the p release rates for both a2o and s2ebpr configurations as shown in table 2 were within the range observed for other full scale ebpr facilities brdjanovic et al 2000 gu et al 2008 he et al 2008 kuba et al 1997a 1997b lÃ³pez vÃ¡zquez et al 2008 the activated sludge in s2ebpr configuration showed higher maximum and average p release rate p uptake rate and p uptake to p release ratio than those in a2o configuration table 2 normalized p release rate has previously been used as an indicator with a positive correlation to pao relative abundance he et al 2008 and ebpr activity zilles et al 2002 however it is not necessarily positively correlated with the ebpr performance in practice gu et al 2008 lanham et al 2013a neethling et al 2006 the p release to acetate uptake ratio p hac is treated as an indicator of the relative pao and gao activities and abundances schuler and jenkins 2003 as shown in table 3 the p hac ratio in s2ebpr configuration was 0 45 p mol c mol which indicates presence of gaos in the system smolders et al 1994a in comparison a much lower p hac ratio 0 22 p mol c mol was observed in a2o configuration indicating a more gao like metabolism and or higher relative abundance of gaos which is consistent with our microbial population results section 3 4 1 the anaerobic glycogen utilization to acetate uptake ratios glyc hac for a2o and s2ebpr configurations ranged from 0 14 to 0 23 c mol c mol which were within the range between tricarboxylic acid tca cycle and glycolysis activity as reported in other full scale ebpr facilities gu et al 2008 lanham et al 2013a both in this study and in other reports s2ebpr systems seem to exhibit relatively higher gly hac ratio than conventional ebpr plants which could be related to an increase in the use of glycolysis pathway over tca cycle lanham et al 2013a the preferential use of glycolysis is considered more efficient through production of additional pha per substrate uptake thus potentially beneficial for ebpr smolders et al 1994a the increased reliance on glycolysis and lower relative abundance of gao section 3 4 1 taken together with the higher tp mlvss content indicate that the s2ebpr configuration involves pao dominated metabolism primarily relying on the glycolysis pathway the anaerobic pha generation to acetate uptake ratios pha hac observed in this study were lower than those values predicted in pao and gao models which might be related to the involvement of tetrasphaera and other heterotrophic bacteria that may take up acetate without storing it as pha kristiansen et al 2013 marques et al 2017 according to our fish results section 3 4 1 different clades of tetrasphaera were prevalent throughout the testing period the aerobic p uptake to pha utilization ratio p pha in s2ebpr configuration 0 97 p mol c mol was 3 times higher than that in a2o configuration and it is higher than predicted values for pao model one possible contributing factor is the involvement of other paos such as tetrasphaera that do not rely on pha for p uptake lanham et al 2013a marques et al 2017 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 the p pha ratio in a2o configuration 0 32 p mol c mol was lower than that in the pao model which could be related to a higher relative abundance of gaos observed by both fish and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing section 3 4 1 3 3 2 extended anaerobic batch test to evaluate the temporal changes in vfa generation and ebpr activity in the side stream anaerobic reactor an extended anaerobic batch test without supplemental carbon addition was conducted using the ras collected from s2ebpr configuration as shown in fig 4 the majority of p release pha production and glycogen utilization were concurrent during the first 18 h of the anaerobic batch test indicating a typical ebpr activity little or no residual vfas and scod were detected during the first 18 h fig 4a which is likely because the substrates generated slowly via sludge fermentation were immediately consumed stored a higher phv phb production ratio than typical range smolders et al 1994a zeng et al 2003 was detected during the first 18 h of the batch test fig 4b reflecting a more complex vfa composition in the generated substrate than those in the conventional wastewater influent the in situ vfa generation with more diverse composition along with the resulted high intracellular pha accumulition during the prolonged anaerobic conditions could potentially favor selection of paos over gaos after 18 h of anaerobic incubation the p release pha production and glycogen utilization ceased while increased scod and vfa generation rates were observed it is hypothesized that paos gaos might have depleted the polyp glycogen pools and or achieved the maximum pha pool thus potentially transitioned from active ebpr metabolism to maintenance oriented metabolism a constant nh4 n release rate was also observed throughout the batch test which was consistent with the level expected for endogenous decay henze et al 2001 previous studies observed that under the extended anaerobic condition without carbon addition the decay rate for accumulibacter paos was lower or negligible compared to gaos carvalheira et al 2014 lu et al 2007 it is speculated that the elastic biochemical pathways depending on the availability and sequential utilization of intracellular polymers polyp and glycogen for paos glycogen only for gaos allows paos to delay the depletion of energy reservoirs under the extended starvation conditions and thus remain longer than gaos before the on set of decay gu et al 2019 nielsen et al 2014 there may be an optimum hrt srt in the side stream anaerobic reactor to maximize the active p release and pha storage of paos for subsequent p uptake and to enrich paos and de select gaos for enhanced carbon utilization efficiency in the full scale s2ebpr plants 3 4 microbial population dynamics and community analysis 3 4 1 functionally relevant populations paos and gaos in order to observe the presence and relative abundance of total paos during the full scale pilot testing dapi staining that targeting intracellular polyp granules was applied to the sludge samples collected at the end of the aerobic zone in each configuration as shown in fig 5 a the total abundance of dapi positive paos changed over the testing time with a higher average abundance in s2ebpr 12 9 4 8 than in a2o configuration 9 1 3 2 p 0 05 indicating a relatively higher polyp accumulating capacity regarding accumulibacter paos both fish and amplicon sequencing results showed comparable relative abundances in a2o and s2ebpr configurations with gradually increasing trends during phase i b fig 5b fig s7 although no significant difference in the accumulibacter abundance between s2ebpr and conventional a2o configuration finer resolution evaluation of the micro diversity of accumulibacter using oligotyping approach indicated distinct accumulibacter sub clades between the two configurations unpublished data after phase i b a decrease in the relative abundance of accumulibacter occurred data not shown as a result of unsteady state conditions caused by the storm events given that the total abundance of dapi positive paos was higher in s2ebpr than in a2o configuration while the relative abundance of known accumulibacter did not show significant differences between two configurations it implies that there are other non accumulibacter paos in the systems these non accumulibacter paos are likely in greater abundance in s2ebpr than in a2o configuration consequently there are multiple factors such as microbial structure and phylogenetic difference pao phenotypic diversity and elasticity and shift in metabolic pathways that could have led to the observed differences in ebpr performance tetrasphaera another important group of putative paos capable of fermentation were detected by fish in a higher relative abundance ranging from 10 7 to 20 7 than accumulibacter fig 5c which is consistent with previous reports on full scale ebpr systems lanham et al 2013a the relative abundance of tetrasphaera in a2o and s2ebpr configurations were comparable during phase i b 15 6 three tetrasphaera related clades including clade 1 clade 2a and clade 3 were dominant in the samples at similar fractions however our amplicon sequencing results showed the average relative abundance of tetrasphaera were only 0 07 which is orders of magnitude lower than the results obtained from the other amplicon based studies on full scale ebpr plants stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 possible explanations for this discrepancy include dna extraction biases against gram positive organism pcr biases variation in the number of 16s rrna gene copies across different organisms the presence of legacy dna from non active organisms albertsen et al 2015 meanwhile the biovolume of fish probe defined tetrasphaera may also be overestimated due to the filamentous morphology of some tetrasphaera species nguyen et al 2011 nevertheless the overall results suggest tetrasphaera or other non accumulibacter paos existed in s2ebpr configuration and potentially contributed for ebpr further studies are warranted to better understand the coexistence and synergy between accumulibacter and tetrasphaera in s2ebpr systems fish targeted gaos were present in much lower relative abundance than paos in both a2o and s2ebpr configurations ranging from 0 6 to 5 2 fig 5d defluviicoccus cluster i and propionivibrio were the most frequently observed gaos which is consistent with the trends of amplicon sequencing results fig s8 although few known gaos were detected in either system the gao abundance in a2o configuration was always greater than in s2ebpr configuration by both fish and amplicon sequencing it should also be noted that an obvious increase in the gao population was observed in the a2o configuration at the end of phase i b especially defluviicoccus cluster i and ca competibacter many studies have demonstrated that both defluviicoccus and competibacter gaos are capable of competing with paos for uptake of either acetate or propionate under anaerobic conditions crocetti et al 2002 dai et al 2007 oehmen et al 2005 which could have contributed to the observed inferior ebpr activity and less stable performance in a2o configuration than that in s2ebpr during phase i b 3 4 2 microbial community structure and diversity higher resolution phylogenetic comparison of the microbial community structures between a2o and s2ebpr configurations were further investigated with 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing during phase i b members of the class betaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria including the genus haliangium comamonadaceae and zoogloea were dominant in both configurations fig 6 which have also been observed in the other full scale ebpr facilities mcilroy et al 2016 onnis hayden et al 2019 zhang et al 2012 there were a total of 57 otus that were common between the two configurations fig s9 otus that were classified as rhodocyclaceae xanthomonadaceae and comamonadaceae were the most abundant of the common core otus and included ca accumulibacter otu00015 of the core community in each of the configurations 14 otus were exclusively present in the a2o community while s2ebpr had 35 otus there were exclusively present this suggests that s2ebpr gave rise to more unique otus that were exclusively part of its core community some of the most abundant otus exclusive to s2ebpr were classified as nannocystaceae moraxellaceae haliangiaceae rhodocyclaceae and nitrospiraceae organisms in the rhodocyclaceae and nitrospiraceae families are known to be involved in p and n removal processes and could be important to the biological nutrient removal bnr processes he and mcmahon 2011 daims et al 2001 as discussed previously due to the variety of environmental factors including plant specific wastewater influent it is usually very difficult to compare and associate the observed community diversities across different wwtps with certain specific factors the pilot testing performed at the rock creek facility provided a unique opportunity to observe the effect of the configuration since the operational environment e g climate and wastewater influent were the same to both treatment trains nmds analysis of the time series samples showed that the two configurations had similar initial microbial communities before the pilot testing fig 7 a during phase i b the communities in a2o and s2ebpr configurations diverged as they became acclimated to the different configurations and associated operational conditions a comparison between the two configurations at each sampling date revealed clear time and configuration dependent separation of microbial communities indicating a distinct community composition in s2ebpr configuration after phase i b with the heavy precipitation events however the communities in a2o and s2ebpr configurations converged and accompanying performance fluctuations were observed microbial diversity in terms of observed otu numbers chao1 pielou evenness shannon and inverse simpson indices for each sample was summarized in table s8 and fig 7b during the pilot testing shannon and inverse simpson diversity indices observed in the s2ebpr configuration was higher than in a2o configuration p 0 05 fig 7b richness and evenness evaluation of the microbial communities revealed a more diverse microbial community in s2ebpr configuration compared to conventional a2o configuration implying that it could show better resilience to perturbations due to potential redundancy and complementation in functions lawson et al 2015 4 discussion 4 1 simultaneous sludge fermentation and ebpr activity our full scale measuremnts and mass balance evalutaion showed that the side stream configuration would allow simultaneous sludge fermenation for substrate production and ebpr activities it has also been observed in the ras hydrolysis reactor jÃ¶nsson and jansen 2006 vollertsen et al 2006 and anaerobic digester bi et al 2013 that ebpr sludge fermentation and active p release by paos could occur simultaneously to confirm the role of sludge hydrolysis and fermentation we also conducted an extended anaerobic batch test to simulate the conditions in the side stream anaerobic reactor which provides detailed information including concentrations of cod n p and vfa in a time series the results as shown in section 3 3 2 indicated that the ebpr activity e g enhanced p release and pha production is associated with substrates e g scod vfas generated via ras hydrolysis fermentation a key feature of s2ebpr ssrc process is a longer anaerobic retention time than that in the conventional anaerobic zone in our study because of shifting influent flow from anaerobic zone to anoxic zone in s2ebpr configuration only primary sludge fermentate and ras entered the side stream reactor which resulted in a relatively longer anaerobic hrt 1 6 2 1 h compared to that in a2o configuration 0 6 0 8 h additionally during phase i b when the mixers in the side stream reactor were operated intermittently the anaerobic srt was decoupled with hrt and extended to a considerable long time as hydrolysis fermentation is one of the rate limiting steps an extended contact reaction time in the side stream anaerobic reactor with low orp would therefore benefit the fermentative organisms to break down complex carbon compounds into vfas and facilitating vfa uptake and pha storage by paos as indicated in the batch test under the prolonged anaerobic condition in the side stream reactor where fermentation occurs paos would continue to accumulate pha i e up to 18 h as long as there are vfa generation from the fermentation and it plateaus presumably as the energy source e g intracellular polyp is exhausted recently tetrasphaera has been found as an abundant pao in full scale and lab scale ebpr systems with capabilities of fermenting diverse carbon sources including sugars amino acids and starch fernando et al 2019 marques et al 2017 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 and adapting to the changing environmental conditions herbst et al 2019 liu et al 2019 it was hypothesized that in the side stream anaerobic reactor with limited external organics the fermentative paos e g tetrasphaera and or the other hydrolysers fermenters may flourish and play crucial roles in the process of ras hydrolysis fermentation fernando et al 2019 nielsen et al 2019 the classical paos e g accumulibacter may then take up the fermentation products e g acetate or propionate for pha storage as confirmed in our study and also evidenced by the other studies nielsen et al 2019 meanwhile both fermentative and classical paos would degrade polyp for their anaerobic energy requirements leading to the simultaneous sludge fermentation and ebpr activity in the side stream reactor 4 2 influent independent carbon sources and c p ratio paos have the ability to take up excess phosphate to produce intracellular polyp which relies on the anaerobic storage of intracellular metabolites e g pha for ca accumulibacter glycogen or other internal storage products for tetrasphaera from utilization of carbon kristiansen et al 2013 mino et al 1998 smolders et al 1994a wentzel et al 1989b therefore sufficient and stable carbon supply are critical for successful ebpr processes conventional ebpr process e g a2o relies directly on the influent carbon vfas which often fluctuates as shown in fig s10 in s2ebpr ssrc configuration the vfa sources for pao enrichment in the side stream anaerobic reactor come from ras fermentation and or additional primary sludge fermentate which provide influent independent and more stable and continuous vfa supply previous studies indicated that the vfa feeding level and strategy impact the microbial population competition broughton et al 2008 tu and schuler 2013 c p ratio has been correlated with ebpr performance gu et al 2008 and the minimum readily biodegradable cod rbcod to p ratio for satisfying p removal in wwtps was recommended as 15 1 25 1 gu et al 2008 randall et al 1998 tetreault et al 1986 oehmen et al 2007 pointed out that a cod p ratio greater than 50 1 tends to favor growth of gaos and recommended a lower cod p ratio ranging from 10 1 20 1 the theoretical vfa requirement for p removal has been proposed to be greater than 8 1 schuler and jenkins 2003 table s9 summarizes the cod p and vfa p ratios in the influent during this pilot study even though high cod tp 72 1 and cod po4 p 80 1 ratios were observed in the influent the vfa p ratio was low 5 1 additional carbon from primary sludge fermentate was added thus increasing the vfa po4 p ratio from 5 1 to 10 1 table s10 in s2ebpr configuration extra carbon sources would be generated via ras fermentation especially during phase i b when the intermittent mixing was implemented in the side stream anaerobic reactor to decouple the srt from hrt for promoting more fermentation based on the carbon and nutrient mass balances and measured p hac ratio in the ex situ batch test it was estimated that 180 kg cod d of vfas could be generated continuously via ras fermentation in the side stream reactor the simulated ras fermentation batch test also showed notable vfa production fig 4 in summary both the influent c p ratios and the sustained steady vfa feeding associated with ras fermentation in the side stream reactor should be considered as impact factors on s2ebpr performance and prevalence of paos this would directly impact pha accumulation along with p release in the anaerobic zones thus affecting p uptake in the downstream aerobic zone the optimum proportion of ras diversion and conditions in the side stream reactor for s2ebpr still need further investigation 4 3 impacts of vfa composition in addition to the c p ratio and carbon input different available carbon sources e g vfas glucose amino acids etc could also have impacts on the pao gao competition in ebpr lÃ³pez vazquez et al 2009 the vfa compositions in influent and primary sludge fermentate are shown in fig s11 the proportion of propionate in primary sludge fermentate 35 was higher than in influent 24 p 0 001 the relative proportions of vfas in primary sludge fermentate were also more consistent than those measured in influent previous studies indicated that vfa uptake rates of accumulibacter paos were similar using either acetate or propionate as carbon source while different groups of gaos seem to have preferences for various carbon sources dai et al 2007 oehmen et al 2006 shen and zhou 2016 therefore vfa feeding strategies such as switching use of acetate propionate lu et al 2006 feeding a combination of acetate and propionate lÃ³pez vazquez et al 2009 dosing slowly and continuously tu and schuler 2013 and propionate feeding under different c p ratios broughton et al 2008 were found to favor lab scale reactors with ca accumulibacter over gaos for full scale wttps such strategies might not always be feasible due to infrastructure limitation and diurnal and seasonal variability of influent however the s2ebpr process enables flexibility to implement the above mentioned strategies such as continuous and slow vfa feeding through ras fermentation more complex vfa composition with a relatively higher proportion of propionate over acetate therefore the conditions in the s2ebpr process could potentially provide a competitive advantage to paos over gaos 4 4 competition among key functionally relevant populations in addition to the enhancement of fermentation for vfa production in the side stream anaerobic rector with longer anaerobic retention time it was previously observed that accumulibacter related paos are able to maintain acetate uptake activity under extended anaerobic conditions 12 h while competibacter related gaos are either unable to maintain activity or cannot survive without external substrate addition nielsen et al 2014 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2015 agent based modeling of pao and gao competition under extended anaerobic conditions indicated that staged maintenance and decay and sequential utilization of intracellular polymers are the underlying biochemical processes for above observations li et al 2018 gu et al 2019 this has been attributed to the biochemical pathway shifts depending on the availability of various intracellular polymers polyp glycogen phas differential polymer utilization and energy requirements for maintenance and decay rates in paos and gaos hao et al 2010 lÃ³pez vÃ¡zquez et al 2008 lu et al 2007 da silva et al 2018 moreover tetrasphaera type paos capable of fermenting different organic substrates would also benefit from the conditions in the side stream anaerobic reactor therefore the extended anaerobic condition likely leads to more decay of gaos and other ohos while paos gain a competitive advantage due to its ability to sustain longer with multiple intracellular polymers as energy reservoirs and more versatile biochemical pathways under changing environmental conditions herbst et al 2019 li et al 2018 although not the focus of this study a reduced daily sludge production was observed in the s2ebpr configuration with 6 reduction compared to the conventional a2o configuration which is possibly attributed to the side stream anaerobic sludge hydrolysis fermentation reactor indicating its potential contributions to sludge treatment chon et al 2011 ferrentino et al 2016 5 conclusions a comparative full scale pilot testing with side by side operation of an s2ebpr configuration ssrc process and a conventional ebpr configuration a2o process was conducted the following conclusions are obtained with the same influent wastewater characteristics s2ebpr configuration had more effective and stable p removal performance especially when the mixers in the side stream anaerobic reactor were operated intermittently both p removal and denitrification were enhanced through diverting influent to anoxic zone and producing additional carbon via ras fermentation higher microbial community diversity indices and lower relative abundance of known gaos were observed in s2ebpr configuration relatively higher pao activity and increased level of glycolysis activity were observed in s2ebpr configuration than those in the conventional a2o process adequate anaerobic retention time and conditions that allow continuous supply of more complex vfas via ras fermentation potentially provide competitive advantage to paos over gaos further studies related to optimization of side stream reactor conditions such as orp srt hrt mixing conditions and percent of ras diversion are required for better process design and operation a more in depth and higher resolution investigation of microbial ecology at finer resolution and corresponding characterization of phenotypic traits are also suggested to reveal the micro diversity of functionally relevant organisms for better understand the fundamental mechanisms underlying the improved performance of s2ebpr systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

18448,this study investigated the polyphosphates accumulation rate in a novel sulfur transformation centric enhanced biological phosphorus removal sebpr process the sebpr system was continuously operated over 120 days in a sequencing batch reactor sbr that alternated between the anaerobic mode and the anoxic mode of operation temperature 30 c and salinity 6000 mg l cl in addition to the sbr batch experiments were carried out to test the effect of two different sulfate concentrations on the system performance and sulfur phosphorus transformations the key intercellular polymers of polyphosphates and polysulfur poly s were identified by employing advanced microscopes metagenomic analysis was performed to characterize the diversity of microbes and their functions enriched in the sebpr system finally several molecular techniques including flow cytometry cell sorting and 16s dna high throughput sequencing were applied to identify the phosphorus accumulating organisms paos the amounts of p release and p uptake in the sebpr increased gradually to nearly 18 6 4 mg p l and 26 5 6 7 mg p l respectively yielding a net p removal efficiency of 84 25 batch tests indicated no polyhydroxyalkanate pha synthesis but p uptake was observed and it was correlated with the intracellular poly s consumption suggesting that the poly s could act as an intracellular energy source for p uptake and polyphosphates formation moreover clsm and tem micrographs clearly showed the presence of intercellular polyphosphates and poly s respectively metagenomic analysis revealed that proteobacteria 36 5 bacteroidetes 23 3 thermotogae 7 1 chloroflexi 4 5 and firmicutes 2 3 were the dominant phyla in bacteria the conventional pao of candidatus accumulibacter was found at a low abundance of 0 32 only and an uncultured genus close to rhodobacteraceae at the family level is speculated to be the putative sulfur pao spao finally this research suggests that poly s considerably impacts on polyphosphates accumulation in the sebpr system when no phas are formed keywords saline wastewater sulfur transformation centric ebpr sebpr polyphosphates poly s phosphorus accumulating organisms paos sulfur bacteria 1 introduction phosphorus p is the controlling factor of eutrophication and algal blooms in sensitive water bodies if not properly treated the rampant growth of harmful algal species will threaten the health and safety of people and the environment eutrophication occurs more frequently in coastal regions with a warm climate sparrow and heimann 2007 heisler et al 2008 to remove the phosphorus pollutant the enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr process was invented and has been applied since the 1980s mino et al 1985 wentzel et al 1989 smolder et al 1994 this bioprocess is governed by phosphorus accumulating organisms paos and generally performed in two steps first intracellular polyphosphates are degraded into orthophosphates p release and volatile fatty acids vfas are taken up into intracellular polyhydroxyalkanoates phas under anaerobic conditions subsequently phas are used as electron donor and oxygen or nitrate as electron acceptor to take up orthophosphate luxury p uptake for polyphosphates replenishment thereby achieving net p removal Î´premoval p uptake p release under anoxic aerobic conditions oehmen et al 2007 henze 2008 it should also be noted that when the paos leave the bioreactor as excess sludge phosphorus can be recovered via chemical extraction and precipitation acevedo et al 2015 salehi et al 2018 however the abovementioned conventional ebpr cebpr is difficult to apply in coastal cities with a warm climate like hong kong whose wastewater is characterized by a relatively high temperature 30 c and salinity 1 wu et al 2014 the cebpr process which was invented for wastewater with a low temperature 5 25 c cannot treat high temperature wastewater 30 c well mainly due to the competition from glycogen accumulating organisms gaos which can quickly transfer vfas to phas anaerobically faster than paos with a higher temperature and accumulate glycogen instead of polyphosphates aerobically panswad et al 2003 whang and park 2006 lopez vazquez et al 2008 2009 oehmen et al 2010 for such a reason the gao population normally dominates the activated sludge process in warm climate regions cao et al 2011 ong et al 2014 moreover cebpr can be negatively affected by high salt and sulfate levels such high salt average chloride 5000 mg l and high sulfate sulfate 50 500 mg so4 2 l conditions could be due to direct use or infiltration of seawater brackish water bear et al 1999 guo et al 2019 hao et al 2014 the performance of paos can be badly affected in a high salinity environment welles et al 2014 and by a high concentration of sulfide produced from anaerobic sulfate reduction yamamoto ikemoto et al 1991 saad et al 2017 finding an alternative pao that can outcompete gaos under moderate temperatures and withstand the effects of high salinity and high sulfide represents one possible way of overcoming the aforementioned challenges ong et al 2014 welles et al 2014 inspired by the research finding that sulfide induces p release in marine sediments schulz and schulz 2005 our group has recently developed a novel sulfur cycle associated bioprocess named denitrifying sulfur conversion associated ebpr ds ebpr in this process the functional bacteria sulfate reducing bacteria srb and sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob can work together to take up vfas and reduced sulfur compounds and form phas and polysulfide elemental sulfur poly s which can be used as electron donors energy source for the simultaneous removal of c n and p with a low sludge yield for saline wastewater treatment in hong kong wu et al 2014 yu et al 2016 guo et al 2016 moreover the synergetic communities of srb and sob in sulfur transformation centric ebpr sebpr can have an advantage in the competition against gao especially when the ph is neutral 7 0 7 5 and the temperature is high 25 30 c guo et al 2017 2018 so in our previous studies we speculated that the sulfur cycle associated ebpr uniquely shifted the carbon cycle driven polyphosphates accumulation to a sulfur cycle driven mechanism guo et al 2017 2018 about half of the vfa carbon still went through the carbon cycle of vfa pha co2 glycogen during which adenosine triphosphate atp would be generated for polyphosphates accumulation hence we do not know how much atp for polyphosphates accumulation came from sulfur conversions fig 1 a in order to realize the sulfur driven mechanisms we developed a new sulfur cycle associated ebpr system which almost only depends on the sulfur redox cycle and eliminates the involvement of the aforementioned carbon cycle we call it sebpr fig 1b the new sebpr was continuously applied over a 120 day period in a sequencing batch reactor sbr alternating between the anaerobic and anoxic modes of operation for the treatment of high temperature 30 c and high salinity 6000 mg l cl wastewater the system performance and sulfur phosphorus transformations were investigated by observing the sbr and performing additional batch experiments microscopic analyses were conducted to identify the key functional intracellular polymers e g poly s and polyphosphates the functional populations in the new sebpr system were identified by a combination of flow cytometry cell sorting gene footprint separation and 16s dna high throughput sequencing the metagenomic characteristics of this new microbiome was also analyzed 2 methods and materials 2 1 reactor design and operating conditions the lab scale sbr used in this study was made of non transparent pvc and had a reaction volume of 20 land a headspace of 10 l as shown in supplementary fig s1 the reactor was tightly covered continuously operated for 120 days and thoroughly mixed using a mechanical mixer operated at 120 rpm the reactor operation can be divided into two periods the start up period period i days 0 40 and the stable operation period period ii days 41 120 the seeding sludge was collected from an anaerobic sludge digester in a local saline sewage treatment plant sha tin sewage treatment works following the method of wu et al 2014 the sbr was operated under alternating anaerobic anoxic conditions for the purpose of developing sebpr the synthetic saline wastewater was fed as influent and as in our previous study wu et al 2014 it contained 400 mg cod linfluent 60 mg nh4 n linfluent and 20 mg po4 3 p linfluent the only organic carbon source was sodium acetate equaled to 150 mg c linfluent an amount 4 l of real toilet flushing seawater equal to 20 of total water demand 20 l was added to provide a sulfur source and simulate the saline sewage in hong kong sulfate concentration 135 8 26 3 mg s l additionaal information about seawater composition can be found elsewhere dai et al 2014 the reactor cyclic operation proceeded in six steps also depicted in fig s2 step i feeding wastewater 10 l of synthetic wastewater was fed into the sbr feeding time 10 min step ii mixing anaerobic phase initiation and reaction the mixing was provided using a mechanical stirrer 120 rpm then the anaerobic phase begins in which sulfate reduction and p release were expected to be the major reactions step iii addition of nitrate sodium nitrate no3 n 1 g l solution was pumped into the reactor step iv anoxic phase initiation and reaction after addition of nitrate the anoxic phase begins in which denitrification sulfate regeneration and p uptake were expected to be the major reactions step v settling when phosphate and nitrate were all consumed in the bulk liquid the anoxic phase was terminated and the mechanical stirrer was stopped to allow settling of sludge for nearly 1 h step vi decantation 10 l of effluent were decanted the above six steps were repeated in each cycle the concentration of acetate sulfate phosphate and nitrate at various steps within a cycle are given in table 1 in the start up period period i the duration of the anaerobic phase was determined to ensure the complete consumption of the carbon source electron donor and no more phosphorus was released wu et al 2013 when the system reached stable operating conditions period ii the durations of the anaerobic phase and the anoxic phase were controlled at 12 h and 24 h respectively during the whole process ph was controlled between 6 9 and 7 9 with a ph controller and the reaction temperature was controlled at 30 c no sludge was intentionally wasted from the system although some escaped via the effluent and regular samples were taken for analysis the excess phosphorus accumulated in sebpr sludge should be extracted and transferred into a phosphorus precipitation tank for resource recovery wu et al 2013 it should also mention that the dissolved oxygen do concentration of both anaerobic and anoxic stages was below 0 05 mg l sewage samples were taken at appropriate sampling intervals for the determination of various parameters such as phosphate acetate nitrate sulfate sulfide polysulfide thiosulfate magnesium and potassium in the liquid phase and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss mixed liquor suspended solids mlss poly s polyphosphates phas and glycogen in the solid phase the system reached a pseudo steady state during period ii when the concentration of the above parameters no longer changed significantly an in situ cycle test taking a sample every 2 h per operating cycle was then conducted in the sbr to investigate the system s cyclic behaviors on day 90 2 2 additional batch experiments in order to reveal the effect of sulfur cycle on p release and uptake and polyphosphates accumulation we conducted two sets of batch tests under 30 c and two initial sulfate concentrations of 10 and 90 mg so4 s l the reported two concentrations were selected mainly to mimic the conditions of real coastal cities saline wastewater in which the sulfate level is between 50 and 500 mg so4 2 l i e 16 7 166 7 mg so4 s l average concentration 91 7 mg so4 s l thus 10 mg so4 s l was treated as the lowest level and 90 mg so4 s l was treated as highest value close to the average concentration the two 4 l batch reactors with the same design and equipped with a ph controller 6 9 7 9 a temperature controller and a mechanical mixer were used for the batch tests named bt a and bt b see fig s3 the synthetic wastewater fed to the sbr was also used in the batch tests in order to make the concentration of sulfate the only variable to be controlled the real seawater was replaced by deionized water with the addition of sodium sulfate and sodium chloride solutions 6000 cl mg l eight liters of sludge were drawn from the sbr at the end of the anoxic phase day 90 and thoroughly washed three times with ultrapure water before being used in the batch test the washed sludge was equally divided between the two batch reactors each test was conducted three times to ensure reproducibility the tests were carried out on consecutive days so the changes in the microbial community could be neglected after the batch experiments the sludge was returned to the sbr 2 3 chemical analysis the temperature ph and oxidation reduction potentisl orp changes were closely monitored and recorded with a wtw multi meter multi 3420 wtw phosphate sulfate acetate and nitrate were determined by ion chromatography lc 20a shimadzu sulfide mlss and mlvss were analyzed in accordance with standard methods apha 2005 magnesium and potassium were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes agilent 710 intracellular compounds including i polyphophates ii poly Î² hydroxyalkanoates mainly poly Î² hydroxybutyrate phb and poly Î² hydroxyvalerate phv iii glycogen and iv polysulfide and elemental sulfur poly s2 s0 were determined according to the analytical methods described in wu et al 2013 2014 and guo et al 2016 2 4 microscopic analysis transmission electron microscopy tem was used to identify whether poly s was stored intracellularly the sludge sample was fixed with 3 glutaraldehyde in a 0 1 m sodium cacodylate buffer scb ph 7 2 for 1 h at 20 c thereafter the sludge sample was immobilized with 4 agar roth germany in scb and thoroughly washed four times with scb polysulfide was stained with agno3 as decribed by scheminzky et al 1972 then the sludge sample was dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and embedded in epoxy resin ultrathin sections approximately 50 nm were prepared and transferred to formvar coated copper grids and examined without further staining using jeol 2010f tem at an acceleration voltage of 100 kev furthermore elemental analysis was conducted with the eds system equipped with a transmission electron microscope barr et al 2010 total bacteria and paos with cellular polyphosphates were analyzed through 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole dapi staining first triplicate 2 ml sludge samples were obtained from the sebpr reactor they were then centrifuged at 3000 g for 3 min and the supernatant was decanted ten milligrams of the pellet were weighed from each sample and the pellet was resuspended in 1000 Î¼l of 1x phosphate buffered saline pbs to separate the individual bacterial cells from sludge these suspensions were sonicated with a branson 450 sonifier and 10 duty cycle for 30 s and then vigorously vortexed for 60 s the sonication condition was carefully optimized to provide the highest efficiency of separation while causing limited damage to the cells the sonicated cells were then diluted tenfold and incubated together with 2 mm dapi final concentration of 0 2 mm at room temperature for 20 min one hundred microliters of this mixture were filtered through a 0 22 Î¼m pore membrane and then observed under a microscope with uv light for excitation images were taken using a spot insight qe color camera fitted to the microscope ten images were taken showing different views of each filter membrane at the applied dapi concentration polyphosphates granules appear bright yellow while cells remain pale blue aschar sobbi et al 2008 nguyen et al 2012 dapi emission spectra were evaluated by excitation at 364 nm and emission at 397 515 nm for dna blue and 537 591 nm for polyphosphates yellow 2 5 microbial analysis 2 5 1 metagenomic analysis sampling microbial sludge samples were taken on days 110 and 116 and subjected to metagenomic sequencing to investigate the structure of the microbial community in the sebpr reactor during each sampling triplicate 5 ml sludge samples were taken with sterile tubes then centrifuged at 20 000 g for 10 min the resulting sludge samples were stored at 20 c in a refrigerator until further analysis dna extraction library construction and illumina sequencing dna was extracted from sludge with an e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek the extracted dna of all samples was mixed into one tube for metagenomic analysis the sheared dna fragment of 300 bp was then excised and extracted for paired end library construction with an ultrasonicator m220 covaris inc after bridge amplification the dna clusters were loaded onto an illumina cbot clark et al 2011 followed by paired end sequencing with an illumina genome analyzer hiseq pe150 sequence quality control and assembly the raw sequences were trimmed with trimmomatic version 0 36 by removing the low quality sequences quality threshold 20 and n sequences length threshold 35 bp the de bruijn method and idba ud version 1 1 2 were then used to assemble the dna clusters afterwards scaffolds were obtained and the sequences were aligned using the ncbi non redundant nr database http ncbi nlm nih gov microbial taxonomy and functional assignment in order to statistically analyze the abundance of each taxon the merged sequences were compared with the ncbi nr database using diamond version 0 8 20 based on the blastp searches at an e value cutoff 10 5 and score 60 for functional assignment the metagenomic data were annotated against seed subsystems in diamond and sorted into 28 subsystems level 1 to provide an overall functional profile level 2 seed subsystems were further annotated in order to study in depth the nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur metabolism in sebpr 2 5 2 flow cytometry cell sorting and identification of putative spaos putative new paos i e sulfur transformation centric paos or spaos were isolated from sebpr sludge through fluorescence activated cell sorting facs with polyphosphates stained with dapi and with unstained cells serving as controls gÃ¼nther et al 2009 the facs was carried out using a moflo cell sorter dakocytomation equipped with two water cooled argon ion lasers innova 90c and innova 70c from coherent for the mixed sludge samples of day 110 and day 116 after sorting the harvested cells were used for 16s dna gene sequencing analysis the dna extraction and illumina miseq high throughput sequencing proceeded according to guo et al 2016 3 results discussion 3 1 verification of the sulfur transformation centric mechanism 3 1 1 observation of p and s during long term reactor operation the sbr was continuously operated for 120 days and the key operational performance is illustrated in fig 2 and table 1 no sludge was intentionally wasted throughout the entire 120 day operation because the sebpr system has a low sludge yield 0 19 mg vss mg cod according to previous studies wu et al 2013 2014 guo et al 2016a b yu et al 2016 the sludge in the reactor slowly decreased from 10 g ss l and 6 g vss l to 7 5 g ss l and 4 5 g vss l in the first 40 days start up period period i and then it self regulated to 7 2 0 3 g ss l and 4 2 0 2 g vss l in the remaining 80 days stable operation period period ii fig 1a the net p removal is the difference between anaerobic p release and anoxic p uptake the amounts of p release and p uptake increased gradually to around 18 6 4 mg p l and 26 5 6 7 mg p l respectively in period ii fig 2b yielding a satisfactory p removal performance with an average removal efficiency of 84 25 in the reactor fig 2c in this study p removal via p harvesting from the sludge is indicated by the increase in the measured p volatile suspended solids vss ratio fig 2b although the maximal p vss ratio is only 24 mg p g vss which is very low compared with those of cebpr 380 mg p g pao vss wentzel et al 1989 and our previous ds ebpr 120 160 mg p g vss wu et al 2013 2014 the very low p vss ratio could be explained by the lack of polyphosphates accumulating organisms enriched in the sebpr system compared with that in wentzel et al s 1989 fully enriched conventional ebpr system with 90 of the biomass being pao vss according to wu et al 2013 microbial analysis of sludge samples with 16s rrna based clone library did not detect any16s rrna gene sequences related to two well known paos e g accumulibacter and tetrasphaera which were further confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization fish analysis however sulfate reducing bacteria srb and sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob were the dominated communities which may carry out the function in sebpr similar observations i e no detection of paos were reached by wu et al 2014 where sludge samples were analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing method however sludge communities were dominated by fermentative bacteria e g lactococcus and sphingomonas genera and sulfate reducing bacteria e g desulfobulus and desulfomicrobium genera some species affiliated to genera sphingomonas were reported a potential glycogen accumulating organisms gaos which compete with paos for carbon source in the current study the abudance of paos e g candidatus accumulibacter at 0 32 and rhodobacteraceae at 1 8 and gaos e g candidatus competibacter at 0 3 was very simillar see section 3 3 1 metagenomic analysis that may cause the observed low p vss ratio compared to previous studies together the findings of these works suggest that more investigations are needed for detection and identification of low abundant paos enriched sulfur mediated ebpr process in the present study for the biological sulfur cycle the analysis was manly focused on the three types of inorganic sulfur compounds sulfate sulfide and poly s since as no organic sulfur contained in the synthetic wastewater used in this work fig 2d shows sulfate concentration mg s l in the reactor both in start up and stable long term operation period it shows sulfate reduction in reaction phase r anaerobic and sulfate production in reaction phase u anoxic towards the end of the operation sulfate reduction and production values were in the range of 50 65 mg s l the plot demonstrates the sulfate level appears to increase which could be due to the decrease in cinf sinf ratio during reaction phase r nearly all the reduced sulfate was stored in the sludge therefore no sulfide evading to the bulk fluid and this observation was similar to a previous work wu et al 2013 moreover in reaction phase u the bulk liquid sulfate concentration increased without a visible change in bulk liquid sulfide concentration thus it is anticipated that the sulfate reduced during reaction phase r was internally stored as poly s2 s0 while the reduced sulfur compounds stored in the sludge as poly s2 s0 could be utilized as electron and or energy sources during reaction phase u and these observations were also noted in previous studies wu et al 2013 3 1 2 analysis of in situ cyclic performance the cyclic performance of the new sebpr process was measured inside the sbr on day 90 the cyclic profiles of phosphate potassium magnesium and polyphosphates composed of mg0 33k0 33p acetate nitrate phas and glycogen were measured and are shown in fig 3 the results reveal that p release p uptake and polyphosphates degradation formation have similar changing trends to those in cebpr whereas the conversion of the carbon cycle was completely different between sebpr and cebpr smolders et al 1994 mino et al 1985 in detail in the anaerobic phase the p release caused the bulk liquid phosphate concentration to increase gradually from 10 to 25 mg p lreactor within the first 12 h and the potassium and magnesium levels in polyphosphates increased from 124 to 130 mg k lreactor and 129 133 mg mg lreactor respectively afterwards the p uptake reaction occurred during the anoxic phase from 12 h to 36 h and the phosphate concentration became undetectable in the bulk liquid after 24 h of reaction meanwhile the potassium and magnesium concentrations decreased to 121 mg k lreactor and 126 mg mg l respectively the k p and mg p ratios were 0 32 and 0 31 in the p release phase and 0 31 and 0 34 in the p uptake phase respectively which are closed to the values reported in the literature oehemn et al 2007 however the acetate was consumed rapidly within the first 4 h and no pha could be detected measured as phb and polyhydroxyvalerate phv combined the sulfate was reduced in the first 4 h of the anaerobic phase and nearly all of the reduced sulfate was converted into storage sulfur compounds poly s the result implies that instead of the formation of intracellular phas the external carbon acetate was utilized by sulfate reduction and the electrons were stored as poly s which was consequently utilized to provide atp for p uptake and polyphosphates replenishment moreover the internal glycogen remained stable and almost did not change throughout the entire reaction period revealing its irrelevance to the ebpr performance satoh et al 1992 moreover the polyphosphates and poly s were visualized at the end of the anoxic phase and the anaerobic phase respectively fig 3c and d the evidence further supports the proposed polyphosphates and poly s accumulation intracellularly 3 2 verification of the significance of sulfur transformation in the additional batch tests bt a and bt b the initial sulfate concentrations were set to low 10 mg s l and high 90 mg s l levels to investigate negligible and significant sulfur cycle transformations respectively the key results in terms of ebpr performance and sulfur cycle are shown in fig 4 and table 2 in bt a the initial sulfate concentration was only 10 mg s l and nearly no sulfate reduction occurred and no poly s was produced during the anaerobic phase the acetate was consumed at a rate of 6 8 mg c l h but some remained even after 8 h no pha was formed during the whole batch test the reason for anaerobic acetate consumption is unclear at this moment but it might have been caused by anaerobic methane production and the storage of acetate in unknown carbon based polymers which should be studied in the future although no pha was synthesized p uptake still occurred during the anoxic phase this p uptake is correlated with the intracellular poly s consumption Î´poly s 30 mg s l implying poly s as an intracellular energy source for p uptake and polyphosphates formation the consumed poly s was actually accumulated in the previous cycles in bt b when the initial sulfate concentration rose to 90 mg s l the sulfate reduction increased to 62 mg s l within 6 h of the anaerobic phase meanwhile the acetate was completely consumed at a rate of 12 5 mg c l h subsequently in the anoxic phase poly s was oxidized for polyphosphates accumulation thus both batch tests further verified the influence of poly s on polyphosphates accumulation 3 3 microbial analysis to characterize this new biological system we carried out microbial analysis to identify the putative spaos and reveal their genomic information 3 3 1 metagenomic analysis the metagenomic sequencing of the sebpr sludge sample resulted in 52 million reads after quality filtering these reads were assembled using idba ud software s de novo assembly algorithm resulting in 115 449 contigs with a minimum length of 300 bp and an average length of 2093 85 bp table s1 the minimum contig length of 300 bp was sufficient for the prediction of open reading frames orfs and resulted in a manageable dataset the microbial community domain comprised 102 different phyla with the highest enrichment of bacteria 84 9 followed by archaea 4 9 fig 5 a proteobacteria 36 5 bacteroidetes 23 3 thermotogae 7 1 chloroflexi 4 5 and firmicutes 2 3 ranked as the top five most abundant phyla in bacteria fig 5a this finding shows that proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi and firmicutes are predominant phyla in sebpr sludge suggesting that these organisms play key roles in biodegradation processes in the sebpr system other abundant phyla of bacteria included acidobacteria 1 55 candidate division zixibacteria 0 79 planctomycetes 0 77 and cyanobacteria 0 74 in addidtion chlorobi verrucomicrobia ignavibacteriae spirochaetes and nitrospirae in total accounted for only 0 25 0 34 of the microbial community as many as 2024 genera were identified in the sebpr sludge which reveal a much higher microbial diversity in this system the first 20 genera are shown in fig 5b among them mesotoga 6 7 lentimicrobium 4 6 bacteroides 3 8 sedimenticola 3 6 thiobacillus 2 3 and sulfuritalea 1 7 were the most prevalent the genus of mesotoga affiliated to the phylum thermotpgae is common in mesophilic anaerobic conditions this genus could accomplish thiosulfate reduction using a sulfide dehydrogenase nesbÃ¸ et al 2019 the fermentative bacterium of lentimicrobium was still enriched in this system although it is always found in methanogenic granular sludge with starch as the carbon source sun et al 2016 which may be attributed to the seeding sludge in this study in sebpr sob including sedimenticola thiobacillus and sulfuritalea were highly enriched and could also utilize nitrate as an electron acceptor flood et al 2015 beller et al 2006 other abundant genera of bacteria included psychrobacter 1 4 prolixibacter 1 0 draconibacterium 0 9 alistipes 0 8 candidate division zixibacteria 0 8 and thioalkalivibrio 0 8 furthermore a deeper investigation of the microbial community at the species level was conducted fig 5c the abundances of species showed similar trends to those at the genus level specifically the conventional paos of candidatus accumulibacter at the species level were found to have a total abundance of 0 32 these paos included candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis candidatus accumulibacter sp ba 91 candidatus accumulibacter sp ba 92 candidatus accumulibacter sp ba 93 candidatus accumulibacter sp ba 94 candidatus accumulibacter sp 01 candidatus accumulibacter sp 02 candidatus accumulibacter sp 11 and candidatus accumulibacter sp 12 the conventional paos could never be detected in the sebpr system wu et al 2014 guo et al 2016 similar to previous studies the abundance of accumulibacter detected was only 0 32 and phosphorus removal could not be accomplished with such a low abundance of paos the microbial community in sebpr was dominated by srb 9 4 including desulfobacterales desulfovibrionales desulfarculales and mesotoga and denitrifying sob 8 0 including sedimenticola thiobacillus sulfuritalea and thiotrichaceae at the same time small amounts of methanogens 3 2 and gaos 0 3 e g candidatus competibacter appeared the family rhodobacteraceae 1 8 which is deeply involved in carbon and sulfur metabolism bioprocesses pujalte et al 2014 could be the putative spaos the impact of high temperature and high salinity conditions on the diversity and abundnace of microbial communities were assessed by comparing the communities profile of the seeding sludge published elsewhere wang et al 2019 and sebpr sludge from this study overall microbial analysis showed shift of community structure when reactor experienced high temperature salinity environment at the phylum level proteobacteria 32 chloroflexi 16 and firmicutes 15 were the top three abundant phyla in seeding sludge however proteobacteria 37 bacteroidetes 23 and thermotogae 7 were the three most abundant in sebpr sludge more indepth analysis at genus level reavelaed a large varioatiobn between the two types of sludge samples the major communities in the seeding sludge were genera of levilinea 6 3 bellilinea 5 0 and exiguobacterium 4 7 whereas the sebpr sludge predominated with the genera of mesotoga 6 7 lentimicrobium 4 6 bacteroides 3 8 the abundance of common srb with name starting at desulfo was low e g desulfobulbus at only 0 29 in the added sludge but their population was enhanced in sebpr uperated under high temperature and saline conditions the functional genes were annotated in diamond using seed subsystems fig 6 a the phylogenetic richness observed reflected a wide metabolic diversity present in the sebpr sludge metagenome among the level 1 subsystems the clustering based subsystems were the most abundant 17 244 reads the second largest subsystem was carbohydrates 15 071 reads followed by protein metabolism 14 655 reads and amino acids and derivatives 12 462 reads in addition other abundant subsystems were dna metabolism 9140 reads cofactors vitamins prosthetic groups pigments 9004 reads and respiration 8816 reads genes assigned to the metabolism of carbohydrates amino acids and proteins resulting from the growth and production of living organisms occurred in high abundance in the sebpr system sequences assigned to functions like nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur metabolisms are essential for the performance of sebpr since they indicate that the microorganisms from the sludge are degrading assimilating such compounds silva et al 2012 the genes responsible for nitrogen sulfur and phosphorus metabolism in sebpr are 3 085 2 674 2600 reads respectively the subsystems of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur metabolism were subjected to further classification analyses in level 2 seed subsystems fig 6b as for the nitrogen metabolism the majority of represented genes encoding enzymes linked to processes such as nitrification denitrification ammonification and nitrogen fixation are considered as important for the removal of complex nitrogen compounds in sewage treatment ammonia assimilation and nitrite nitrate ammonification related genes had the highest sequence numbers 902 and 915 respectively followed by denitrification 718 sequences dissimilatory nitrite reductase 205 sequences and nitrogen fixation 145 sequences moreover the phosphorus metabolism at level 2 of seed subsystems was quite remarkable with high affinity phosphate transporter 2645 reads and pho regulon 1080 reads having these functional genes which responsible for phosphorus removal could maintain the ebpr performance even under high temperature and high saline concentration as for the sulfur metabolism including sulfate reduction and sulfur oxidation bioprocesses the related functional genes were also identified with sulfate reduction associated genes and sulfur oxidation genes 448 and 399 reads respectively to our knowledge limited information is available on changes of microbial metabolisms metabolic processes e g p related metabolism in paos when communities experienced stress environments like high salinity temperature according to literature bassin et al 2011 welles et al 2014 salt concentration and duration of exposure significantly impact the competition between paos and gaos with paos being more sensitive to the increasing salinity level and longer exposure time bassin et al 2011 found that no p release or uptake at 33 g l nacl and the observation was fully matched with the pcr dgge fish based microbial analysis because no detection of paos candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis bacteria welles et al 2014 demonstrated that the maintenance energy requirement of paos increased to nearly 0 025 mol atp c mol h when the salinity concentration rose up to 2 on a w v basis as nacl moreover phosphate uptake rate decreased by 46 when salinity level increased from 0 to 0 18 w v in the present study the selected salinity level is 6 g l and the temperature is 30 c negatively affect conventional ebpr as reported by ong et al 2014 but the lab scale system can still perform ebpr over 100 days implying the potential of the development such sulfur centric ebpr process 3 3 2 cell sorting and verification of the putative spaos through the facs experiments the cells containing polyphosphates could be sorted out the results are shown in the fluorescence images fig 7 a before sorting the bright yellow cells were paos while the blue cells were other bacteria after sorting most of cells were paos as expected in addition the cell counts of the paos before and after the sorting process were 9 3 4 3 and 49 6 3 3 respectively furthermore the sorted sample was analyzed through high throughput sequencing and the key results were used to construct the phylogenetic tree fig 7b interestingly about half of the clones belong to an uncultured genus of alphaproteobacteria which is close to the rhodobacteraceae at the family level and thus it could be the paos in the new sebpr system finally this result coincides with that of the above metagenomics analysis the isolation and cultivation of the putative spaos and examination of their physiology deserve further study 4 conclusions this paper reports the impact of poly s on polyphosphates accumulation in a novel sebpr process specifically developed for the treatment of high temperature saline wastewater a set of chemical microscopic and microbial analyses were performed the sebpr system reached a p release of around 18 6 4 and a p uptake of around 26 5 6 7 mg p l resulting in an average p removal efficiency of 84 25 in batch tests no pha was synthesized but p uptake was observed and it was highly correlated with the intracellular poly s consumption this observation suggests that poly s could act as an intracellular energy source for p uptake and polyphosphates formation moreover microscopic clsm and tem images indicated the presence of intercellular polyphosphates and poly s metagenomic analysis revealed that proteobacteria 36 5 bacteroidetes 23 3 thermotogae 7 1 chloroflexi 4 5 and firmicutes 2 3 were the major phyla in bacteria enriched in the sebpr system the communities consisted of a reasonable population of srb 9 4 and denitrifying sob 8 0 the conventional paos of candidatus accumulibacter were found at only 0 32 abundance and the putative paos rhodobacteraceae are believed to be the key microorganisms which play significant role in p removal in the sebpr process the cell counts of the paos before and after the sorting process were 9 3 4 3 and 49 6 3 3 respectively together the findings of this research suggest that poly s

18448,this study investigated the polyphosphates accumulation rate in a novel sulfur transformation centric enhanced biological phosphorus removal sebpr process the sebpr system was continuously operated over 120 days in a sequencing batch reactor sbr that alternated between the anaerobic mode and the anoxic mode of operation temperature 30 c and salinity 6000 mg l cl in addition to the sbr batch experiments were carried out to test the effect of two different sulfate concentrations on the system performance and sulfur phosphorus transformations the key intercellular polymers of polyphosphates and polysulfur poly s were identified by employing advanced microscopes metagenomic analysis was performed to characterize the diversity of microbes and their functions enriched in the sebpr system finally several molecular techniques including flow cytometry cell sorting and 16s dna high throughput sequencing were applied to identify the phosphorus accumulating organisms paos the amounts of p release and p uptake in the sebpr increased gradually to nearly 18 6 4 mg p l and 26 5 6 7 mg p l respectively yielding a net p removal efficiency of 84 25 batch tests indicated no polyhydroxyalkanate pha synthesis but p uptake was observed and it was correlated with the intracellular poly s consumption suggesting that the poly s could act as an intracellular energy source for p uptake and polyphosphates formation moreover clsm and tem micrographs clearly showed the presence of intercellular polyphosphates and poly s respectively metagenomic analysis revealed that proteobacteria 36 5 bacteroidetes 23 3 thermotogae 7 1 chloroflexi 4 5 and firmicutes 2 3 were the dominant phyla in bacteria the conventional pao of candidatus accumulibacter was found at a low abundance of 0 32 only and an uncultured genus close to rhodobacteraceae at the family level is speculated to be the putative sulfur pao spao finally this research suggests that poly s considerably impacts on polyphosphates accumulation in the sebpr system when no phas are formed keywords saline wastewater sulfur transformation centric ebpr sebpr polyphosphates poly s phosphorus accumulating organisms paos sulfur bacteria 1 introduction phosphorus p is the controlling factor of eutrophication and algal blooms in sensitive water bodies if not properly treated the rampant growth of harmful algal species will threaten the health and safety of people and the environment eutrophication occurs more frequently in coastal regions with a warm climate sparrow and heimann 2007 heisler et al 2008 to remove the phosphorus pollutant the enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr process was invented and has been applied since the 1980s mino et al 1985 wentzel et al 1989 smolder et al 1994 this bioprocess is governed by phosphorus accumulating organisms paos and generally performed in two steps first intracellular polyphosphates are degraded into orthophosphates p release and volatile fatty acids vfas are taken up into intracellular polyhydroxyalkanoates phas under anaerobic conditions subsequently phas are used as electron donor and oxygen or nitrate as electron acceptor to take up orthophosphate luxury p uptake for polyphosphates replenishment thereby achieving net p removal Î´premoval p uptake p release under anoxic aerobic conditions oehmen et al 2007 henze 2008 it should also be noted that when the paos leave the bioreactor as excess sludge phosphorus can be recovered via chemical extraction and precipitation acevedo et al 2015 salehi et al 2018 however the abovementioned conventional ebpr cebpr is difficult to apply in coastal cities with a warm climate like hong kong whose wastewater is characterized by a relatively high temperature 30 c and salinity 1 wu et al 2014 the cebpr process which was invented for wastewater with a low temperature 5 25 c cannot treat high temperature wastewater 30 c well mainly due to the competition from glycogen accumulating organisms gaos which can quickly transfer vfas to phas anaerobically faster than paos with a higher temperature and accumulate glycogen instead of polyphosphates aerobically panswad et al 2003 whang and park 2006 lopez vazquez et al 2008 2009 oehmen et al 2010 for such a reason the gao population normally dominates the activated sludge process in warm climate regions cao et al 2011 ong et al 2014 moreover cebpr can be negatively affected by high salt and sulfate levels such high salt average chloride 5000 mg l and high sulfate sulfate 50 500 mg so4 2 l conditions could be due to direct use or infiltration of seawater brackish water bear et al 1999 guo et al 2019 hao et al 2014 the performance of paos can be badly affected in a high salinity environment welles et al 2014 and by a high concentration of sulfide produced from anaerobic sulfate reduction yamamoto ikemoto et al 1991 saad et al 2017 finding an alternative pao that can outcompete gaos under moderate temperatures and withstand the effects of high salinity and high sulfide represents one possible way of overcoming the aforementioned challenges ong et al 2014 welles et al 2014 inspired by the research finding that sulfide induces p release in marine sediments schulz and schulz 2005 our group has recently developed a novel sulfur cycle associated bioprocess named denitrifying sulfur conversion associated ebpr ds ebpr in this process the functional bacteria sulfate reducing bacteria srb and sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob can work together to take up vfas and reduced sulfur compounds and form phas and polysulfide elemental sulfur poly s which can be used as electron donors energy source for the simultaneous removal of c n and p with a low sludge yield for saline wastewater treatment in hong kong wu et al 2014 yu et al 2016 guo et al 2016 moreover the synergetic communities of srb and sob in sulfur transformation centric ebpr sebpr can have an advantage in the competition against gao especially when the ph is neutral 7 0 7 5 and the temperature is high 25 30 c guo et al 2017 2018 so in our previous studies we speculated that the sulfur cycle associated ebpr uniquely shifted the carbon cycle driven polyphosphates accumulation to a sulfur cycle driven mechanism guo et al 2017 2018 about half of the vfa carbon still went through the carbon cycle of vfa pha co2 glycogen during which adenosine triphosphate atp would be generated for polyphosphates accumulation hence we do not know how much atp for polyphosphates accumulation came from sulfur conversions fig 1 a in order to realize the sulfur driven mechanisms we developed a new sulfur cycle associated ebpr system which almost only depends on the sulfur redox cycle and eliminates the involvement of the aforementioned carbon cycle we call it sebpr fig 1b the new sebpr was continuously applied over a 120 day period in a sequencing batch reactor sbr alternating between the anaerobic and anoxic modes of operation for the treatment of high temperature 30 c and high salinity 6000 mg l cl wastewater the system performance and sulfur phosphorus transformations were investigated by observing the sbr and performing additional batch experiments microscopic analyses were conducted to identify the key functional intracellular polymers e g poly s and polyphosphates the functional populations in the new sebpr system were identified by a combination of flow cytometry cell sorting gene footprint separation and 16s dna high throughput sequencing the metagenomic characteristics of this new microbiome was also analyzed 2 methods and materials 2 1 reactor design and operating conditions the lab scale sbr used in this study was made of non transparent pvc and had a reaction volume of 20 land a headspace of 10 l as shown in supplementary fig s1 the reactor was tightly covered continuously operated for 120 days and thoroughly mixed using a mechanical mixer operated at 120 rpm the reactor operation can be divided into two periods the start up period period i days 0 40 and the stable operation period period ii days 41 120 the seeding sludge was collected from an anaerobic sludge digester in a local saline sewage treatment plant sha tin sewage treatment works following the method of wu et al 2014 the sbr was operated under alternating anaerobic anoxic conditions for the purpose of developing sebpr the synthetic saline wastewater was fed as influent and as in our previous study wu et al 2014 it contained 400 mg cod linfluent 60 mg nh4 n linfluent and 20 mg po4 3 p linfluent the only organic carbon source was sodium acetate equaled to 150 mg c linfluent an amount 4 l of real toilet flushing seawater equal to 20 of total water demand 20 l was added to provide a sulfur source and simulate the saline sewage in hong kong sulfate concentration 135 8 26 3 mg s l additionaal information about seawater composition can be found elsewhere dai et al 2014 the reactor cyclic operation proceeded in six steps also depicted in fig s2 step i feeding wastewater 10 l of synthetic wastewater was fed into the sbr feeding time 10 min step ii mixing anaerobic phase initiation and reaction the mixing was provided using a mechanical stirrer 120 rpm then the anaerobic phase begins in which sulfate reduction and p release were expected to be the major reactions step iii addition of nitrate sodium nitrate no3 n 1 g l solution was pumped into the reactor step iv anoxic phase initiation and reaction after addition of nitrate the anoxic phase begins in which denitrification sulfate regeneration and p uptake were expected to be the major reactions step v settling when phosphate and nitrate were all consumed in the bulk liquid the anoxic phase was terminated and the mechanical stirrer was stopped to allow settling of sludge for nearly 1 h step vi decantation 10 l of effluent were decanted the above six steps were repeated in each cycle the concentration of acetate sulfate phosphate and nitrate at various steps within a cycle are given in table 1 in the start up period period i the duration of the anaerobic phase was determined to ensure the complete consumption of the carbon source electron donor and no more phosphorus was released wu et al 2013 when the system reached stable operating conditions period ii the durations of the anaerobic phase and the anoxic phase were controlled at 12 h and 24 h respectively during the whole process ph was controlled between 6 9 and 7 9 with a ph controller and the reaction temperature was controlled at 30 c no sludge was intentionally wasted from the system although some escaped via the effluent and regular samples were taken for analysis the excess phosphorus accumulated in sebpr sludge should be extracted and transferred into a phosphorus precipitation tank for resource recovery wu et al 2013 it should also mention that the dissolved oxygen do concentration of both anaerobic and anoxic stages was below 0 05 mg l sewage samples were taken at appropriate sampling intervals for the determination of various parameters such as phosphate acetate nitrate sulfate sulfide polysulfide thiosulfate magnesium and potassium in the liquid phase and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss mixed liquor suspended solids mlss poly s polyphosphates phas and glycogen in the solid phase the system reached a pseudo steady state during period ii when the concentration of the above parameters no longer changed significantly an in situ cycle test taking a sample every 2 h per operating cycle was then conducted in the sbr to investigate the system s cyclic behaviors on day 90 2 2 additional batch experiments in order to reveal the effect of sulfur cycle on p release and uptake and polyphosphates accumulation we conducted two sets of batch tests under 30 c and two initial sulfate concentrations of 10 and 90 mg so4 s l the reported two concentrations were selected mainly to mimic the conditions of real coastal cities saline wastewater in which the sulfate level is between 50 and 500 mg so4 2 l i e 16 7 166 7 mg so4 s l average concentration 91 7 mg so4 s l thus 10 mg so4 s l was treated as the lowest level and 90 mg so4 s l was treated as highest value close to the average concentration the two 4 l batch reactors with the same design and equipped with a ph controller 6 9 7 9 a temperature controller and a mechanical mixer were used for the batch tests named bt a and bt b see fig s3 the synthetic wastewater fed to the sbr was also used in the batch tests in order to make the concentration of sulfate the only variable to be controlled the real seawater was replaced by deionized water with the addition of sodium sulfate and sodium chloride solutions 6000 cl mg l eight liters of sludge were drawn from the sbr at the end of the anoxic phase day 90 and thoroughly washed three times with ultrapure water before being used in the batch test the washed sludge was equally divided between the two batch reactors each test was conducted three times to ensure reproducibility the tests were carried out on consecutive days so the changes in the microbial community could be neglected after the batch experiments the sludge was returned to the sbr 2 3 chemical analysis the temperature ph and oxidation reduction potentisl orp changes were closely monitored and recorded with a wtw multi meter multi 3420 wtw phosphate sulfate acetate and nitrate were determined by ion chromatography lc 20a shimadzu sulfide mlss and mlvss were analyzed in accordance with standard methods apha 2005 magnesium and potassium were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes agilent 710 intracellular compounds including i polyphophates ii poly Î² hydroxyalkanoates mainly poly Î² hydroxybutyrate phb and poly Î² hydroxyvalerate phv iii glycogen and iv polysulfide and elemental sulfur poly s2 s0 were determined according to the analytical methods described in wu et al 2013 2014 and guo et al 2016 2 4 microscopic analysis transmission electron microscopy tem was used to identify whether poly s was stored intracellularly the sludge sample was fixed with 3 glutaraldehyde in a 0 1 m sodium cacodylate buffer scb ph 7 2 for 1 h at 20 c thereafter the sludge sample was immobilized with 4 agar roth germany in scb and thoroughly washed four times with scb polysulfide was stained with agno3 as decribed by scheminzky et al 1972 then the sludge sample was dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and embedded in epoxy resin ultrathin sections approximately 50 nm were prepared and transferred to formvar coated copper grids and examined without further staining using jeol 2010f tem at an acceleration voltage of 100 kev furthermore elemental analysis was conducted with the eds system equipped with a transmission electron microscope barr et al 2010 total bacteria and paos with cellular polyphosphates were analyzed through 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole dapi staining first triplicate 2 ml sludge samples were obtained from the sebpr reactor they were then centrifuged at 3000 g for 3 min and the supernatant was decanted ten milligrams of the pellet were weighed from each sample and the pellet was resuspended in 1000 Î¼l of 1x phosphate buffered saline pbs to separate the individual bacterial cells from sludge these suspensions were sonicated with a branson 450 sonifier and 10 duty cycle for 30 s and then vigorously vortexed for 60 s the sonication condition was carefully optimized to provide the highest efficiency of separation while causing limited damage to the cells the sonicated cells were then diluted tenfold and incubated together with 2 mm dapi final concentration of 0 2 mm at room temperature for 20 min one hundred microliters of this mixture were filtered through a 0 22 Î¼m pore membrane and then observed under a microscope with uv light for excitation images were taken using a spot insight qe color camera fitted to the microscope ten images were taken showing different views of each filter membrane at the applied dapi concentration polyphosphates granules appear bright yellow while cells remain pale blue aschar sobbi et al 2008 nguyen et al 2012 dapi emission spectra were evaluated by excitation at 364 nm and emission at 397 515 nm for dna blue and 537 591 nm for polyphosphates yellow 2 5 microbial analysis 2 5 1 metagenomic analysis sampling microbial sludge samples were taken on days 110 and 116 and subjected to metagenomic sequencing to investigate the structure of the microbial community in the sebpr reactor during each sampling triplicate 5 ml sludge samples were taken with sterile tubes then centrifuged at 20 000 g for 10 min the resulting sludge samples were stored at 20 c in a refrigerator until further analysis dna extraction library construction and illumina sequencing dna was extracted from sludge with an e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek the extracted dna of all samples was mixed into one tube for metagenomic analysis the sheared dna fragment of 300 bp was then excised and extracted for paired end library construction with an ultrasonicator m220 covaris inc after bridge amplification the dna clusters were loaded onto an illumina cbot clark et al 2011 followed by paired end sequencing with an illumina genome analyzer hiseq pe150 sequence quality control and assembly the raw sequences were trimmed with trimmomatic version 0 36 by removing the low quality sequences quality threshold 20 and n sequences length threshold 35 bp the de bruijn method and idba ud version 1 1 2 were then used to assemble the dna clusters afterwards scaffolds were obtained and the sequences were aligned using the ncbi non redundant nr database http ncbi nlm nih gov microbial taxonomy and functional assignment in order to statistically analyze the abundance of each taxon the merged sequences were compared with the ncbi nr database using diamond version 0 8 20 based on the blastp searches at an e value cutoff 10 5 and score 60 for functional assignment the metagenomic data were annotated against seed subsystems in diamond and sorted into 28 subsystems level 1 to provide an overall functional profile level 2 seed subsystems were further annotated in order to study in depth the nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur metabolism in sebpr 2 5 2 flow cytometry cell sorting and identification of putative spaos putative new paos i e sulfur transformation centric paos or spaos were isolated from sebpr sludge through fluorescence activated cell sorting facs with polyphosphates stained with dapi and with unstained cells serving as controls gÃ¼nther et al 2009 the facs was carried out using a moflo cell sorter dakocytomation equipped with two water cooled argon ion lasers innova 90c and innova 70c from coherent for the mixed sludge samples of day 110 and day 116 after sorting the harvested cells were used for 16s dna gene sequencing analysis the dna extraction and illumina miseq high throughput sequencing proceeded according to guo et al 2016 3 results discussion 3 1 verification of the sulfur transformation centric mechanism 3 1 1 observation of p and s during long term reactor operation the sbr was continuously operated for 120 days and the key operational performance is illustrated in fig 2 and table 1 no sludge was intentionally wasted throughout the entire 120 day operation because the sebpr system has a low sludge yield 0 19 mg vss mg cod according to previous studies wu et al 2013 2014 guo et al 2016a b yu et al 2016 the sludge in the reactor slowly decreased from 10 g ss l and 6 g vss l to 7 5 g ss l and 4 5 g vss l in the first 40 days start up period period i and then it self regulated to 7 2 0 3 g ss l and 4 2 0 2 g vss l in the remaining 80 days stable operation period period ii fig 1a the net p removal is the difference between anaerobic p release and anoxic p uptake the amounts of p release and p uptake increased gradually to around 18 6 4 mg p l and 26 5 6 7 mg p l respectively in period ii fig 2b yielding a satisfactory p removal performance with an average removal efficiency of 84 25 in the reactor fig 2c in this study p removal via p harvesting from the sludge is indicated by the increase in the measured p volatile suspended solids vss ratio fig 2b although the maximal p vss ratio is only 24 mg p g vss which is very low compared with those of cebpr 380 mg p g pao vss wentzel et al 1989 and our previous ds ebpr 120 160 mg p g vss wu et al 2013 2014 the very low p vss ratio could be explained by the lack of polyphosphates accumulating organisms enriched in the sebpr system compared with that in wentzel et al s 1989 fully enriched conventional ebpr system with 90 of the biomass being pao vss according to wu et al 2013 microbial analysis of sludge samples with 16s rrna based clone library did not detect any16s rrna gene sequences related to two well known paos e g accumulibacter and tetrasphaera which were further confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization fish analysis however sulfate reducing bacteria srb and sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob were the dominated communities which may carry out the function in sebpr similar observations i e no detection of paos were reached by wu et al 2014 where sludge samples were analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing method however sludge communities were dominated by fermentative bacteria e g lactococcus and sphingomonas genera and sulfate reducing bacteria e g desulfobulus and desulfomicrobium genera some species affiliated to genera sphingomonas were reported a potential glycogen accumulating organisms gaos which compete with paos for carbon source in the current study the abudance of paos e g candidatus accumulibacter at 0 32 and rhodobacteraceae at 1 8 and gaos e g candidatus competibacter at 0 3 was very simillar see section 3 3 1 metagenomic analysis that may cause the observed low p vss ratio compared to previous studies together the findings of these works suggest that more investigations are needed for detection and identification of low abundant paos enriched sulfur mediated ebpr process in the present study for the biological sulfur cycle the analysis was manly focused on the three types of inorganic sulfur compounds sulfate sulfide and poly s since as no organic sulfur contained in the synthetic wastewater used in this work fig 2d shows sulfate concentration mg s l in the reactor both in start up and stable long term operation period it shows sulfate reduction in reaction phase r anaerobic and sulfate production in reaction phase u anoxic towards the end of the operation sulfate reduction and production values were in the range of 50 65 mg s l the plot demonstrates the sulfate level appears to increase which could be due to the decrease in cinf sinf ratio during reaction phase r nearly all the reduced sulfate was stored in the sludge therefore no sulfide evading to the bulk fluid and this observation was similar to a previous work wu et al 2013 moreover in reaction phase u the bulk liquid sulfate concentration increased without a visible change in bulk liquid sulfide concentration thus it is anticipated that the sulfate reduced during reaction phase r was internally stored as poly s2 s0 while the reduced sulfur compounds stored in the sludge as poly s2 s0 could be utilized as electron and or energy sources during reaction phase u and these observations were also noted in previous studies wu et al 2013 3 1 2 analysis of in situ cyclic performance the cyclic performance of the new sebpr process was measured inside the sbr on day 90 the cyclic profiles of phosphate potassium magnesium and polyphosphates composed of mg0 33k0 33p acetate nitrate phas and glycogen were measured and are shown in fig 3 the results reveal that p release p uptake and polyphosphates degradation formation have similar changing trends to those in cebpr whereas the conversion of the carbon cycle was completely different between sebpr and cebpr smolders et al 1994 mino et al 1985 in detail in the anaerobic phase the p release caused the bulk liquid phosphate concentration to increase gradually from 10 to 25 mg p lreactor within the first 12 h and the potassium and magnesium levels in polyphosphates increased from 124 to 130 mg k lreactor and 129 133 mg mg lreactor respectively afterwards the p uptake reaction occurred during the anoxic phase from 12 h to 36 h and the phosphate concentration became undetectable in the bulk liquid after 24 h of reaction meanwhile the potassium and magnesium concentrations decreased to 121 mg k lreactor and 126 mg mg l respectively the k p and mg p ratios were 0 32 and 0 31 in the p release phase and 0 31 and 0 34 in the p uptake phase respectively which are closed to the values reported in the literature oehemn et al 2007 however the acetate was consumed rapidly within the first 4 h and no pha could be detected measured as phb and polyhydroxyvalerate phv combined the sulfate was reduced in the first 4 h of the anaerobic phase and nearly all of the reduced sulfate was converted into storage sulfur compounds poly s the result implies that instead of the formation of intracellular phas the external carbon acetate was utilized by sulfate reduction and the electrons were stored as poly s which was consequently utilized to provide atp for p uptake and polyphosphates replenishment moreover the internal glycogen remained stable and almost did not change throughout the entire reaction period revealing its irrelevance to the ebpr performance satoh et al 1992 moreover the polyphosphates and poly s were visualized at the end of the anoxic phase and the anaerobic phase respectively fig 3c and d the evidence further supports the proposed polyphosphates and poly s accumulation intracellularly 3 2 verification of the significance of sulfur transformation in the additional batch tests bt a and bt b the initial sulfate concentrations were set to low 10 mg s l and high 90 mg s l levels to investigate negligible and significant sulfur cycle transformations respectively the key results in terms of ebpr performance and sulfur cycle are shown in fig 4 and table 2 in bt a the initial sulfate concentration was only 10 mg s l and nearly no sulfate reduction occurred and no poly s was produced during the anaerobic phase the acetate was consumed at a rate of 6 8 mg c l h but some remained even after 8 h no pha was formed during the whole batch test the reason for anaerobic acetate consumption is unclear at this moment but it might have been caused by anaerobic methane production and the storage of acetate in unknown carbon based polymers which should be studied in the future although no pha was synthesized p uptake still occurred during the anoxic phase this p uptake is correlated with the intracellular poly s consumption Î´poly s 30 mg s l implying poly s as an intracellular energy source for p uptake and polyphosphates formation the consumed poly s was actually accumulated in the previous cycles in bt b when the initial sulfate concentration rose to 90 mg s l the sulfate reduction increased to 62 mg s l within 6 h of the anaerobic phase meanwhile the acetate was completely consumed at a rate of 12 5 mg c l h subsequently in the anoxic phase poly s was oxidized for polyphosphates accumulation thus both batch tests further verified the influence of poly s on polyphosphates accumulation 3 3 microbial analysis to characterize this new biological system we carried out microbial analysis to identify the putative spaos and reveal their genomic information 3 3 1 metagenomic analysis the metagenomic sequencing of the sebpr sludge sample resulted in 52 million reads after quality filtering these reads were assembled using idba ud software s de novo assembly algorithm resulting in 115 449 contigs with a minimum length of 300 bp and an average length of 2093 85 bp table s1 the minimum contig length of 300 bp was sufficient for the prediction of open reading frames orfs and resulted in a manageable dataset the microbial community domain comprised 102 different phyla with the highest enrichment of bacteria 84 9 followed by archaea 4 9 fig 5 a proteobacteria 36 5 bacteroidetes 23 3 thermotogae 7 1 chloroflexi 4 5 and firmicutes 2 3 ranked as the top five most abundant phyla in bacteria fig 5a this finding shows that proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi and firmicutes are predominant phyla in sebpr sludge suggesting that these organisms play key roles in biodegradation processes in the sebpr system other abundant phyla of bacteria included acidobacteria 1 55 candidate division zixibacteria 0 79 planctomycetes 0 77 and cyanobacteria 0 74 in addidtion chlorobi verrucomicrobia ignavibacteriae spirochaetes and nitrospirae in total accounted for only 0 25 0 34 of the microbial community as many as 2024 genera were identified in the sebpr sludge which reveal a much higher microbial diversity in this system the first 20 genera are shown in fig 5b among them mesotoga 6 7 lentimicrobium 4 6 bacteroides 3 8 sedimenticola 3 6 thiobacillus 2 3 and sulfuritalea 1 7 were the most prevalent the genus of mesotoga affiliated to the phylum thermotpgae is common in mesophilic anaerobic conditions this genus could accomplish thiosulfate reduction using a sulfide dehydrogenase nesbÃ¸ et al 2019 the fermentative bacterium of lentimicrobium was still enriched in this system although it is always found in methanogenic granular sludge with starch as the carbon source sun et al 2016 which may be attributed to the seeding sludge in this study in sebpr sob including sedimenticola thiobacillus and sulfuritalea were highly enriched and could also utilize nitrate as an electron acceptor flood et al 2015 beller et al 2006 other abundant genera of bacteria included psychrobacter 1 4 prolixibacter 1 0 draconibacterium 0 9 alistipes 0 8 candidate division zixibacteria 0 8 and thioalkalivibrio 0 8 furthermore a deeper investigation of the microbial community at the species level was conducted fig 5c the abundances of species showed similar trends to those at the genus level specifically the conventional paos of candidatus accumulibacter at the species level were found to have a total abundance of 0 32 these paos included candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis candidatus accumulibacter sp ba 91 candidatus accumulibacter sp ba 92 candidatus accumulibacter sp ba 93 candidatus accumulibacter sp ba 94 candidatus accumulibacter sp 01 candidatus accumulibacter sp 02 candidatus accumulibacter sp 11 and candidatus accumulibacter sp 12 the conventional paos could never be detected in the sebpr system wu et al 2014 guo et al 2016 similar to previous studies the abundance of accumulibacter detected was only 0 32 and phosphorus removal could not be accomplished with such a low abundance of paos the microbial community in sebpr was dominated by srb 9 4 including desulfobacterales desulfovibrionales desulfarculales and mesotoga and denitrifying sob 8 0 including sedimenticola thiobacillus sulfuritalea and thiotrichaceae at the same time small amounts of methanogens 3 2 and gaos 0 3 e g candidatus competibacter appeared the family rhodobacteraceae 1 8 which is deeply involved in carbon and sulfur metabolism bioprocesses pujalte et al 2014 could be the putative spaos the impact of high temperature and high salinity conditions on the diversity and abundnace of microbial communities were assessed by comparing the communities profile of the seeding sludge published elsewhere wang et al 2019 and sebpr sludge from this study overall microbial analysis showed shift of community structure when reactor experienced high temperature salinity environment at the phylum level proteobacteria 32 chloroflexi 16 and firmicutes 15 were the top three abundant phyla in seeding sludge however proteobacteria 37 bacteroidetes 23 and thermotogae 7 were the three most abundant in sebpr sludge more indepth analysis at genus level reavelaed a large varioatiobn between the two types of sludge samples the major communities in the seeding sludge were genera of levilinea 6 3 bellilinea 5 0 and exiguobacterium 4 7 whereas the sebpr sludge predominated with the genera of mesotoga 6 7 lentimicrobium 4 6 bacteroides 3 8 the abundance of common srb with name starting at desulfo was low e g desulfobulbus at only 0 29 in the added sludge but their population was enhanced in sebpr uperated under high temperature and saline conditions the functional genes were annotated in diamond using seed subsystems fig 6 a the phylogenetic richness observed reflected a wide metabolic diversity present in the sebpr sludge metagenome among the level 1 subsystems the clustering based subsystems were the most abundant 17 244 reads the second largest subsystem was carbohydrates 15 071 reads followed by protein metabolism 14 655 reads and amino acids and derivatives 12 462 reads in addition other abundant subsystems were dna metabolism 9140 reads cofactors vitamins prosthetic groups pigments 9004 reads and respiration 8816 reads genes assigned to the metabolism of carbohydrates amino acids and proteins resulting from the growth and production of living organisms occurred in high abundance in the sebpr system sequences assigned to functions like nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur metabolisms are essential for the performance of sebpr since they indicate that the microorganisms from the sludge are degrading assimilating such compounds silva et al 2012 the genes responsible for nitrogen sulfur and phosphorus metabolism in sebpr are 3 085 2 674 2600 reads respectively the subsystems of nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur metabolism were subjected to further classification analyses in level 2 seed subsystems fig 6b as for the nitrogen metabolism the majority of represented genes encoding enzymes linked to processes such as nitrification denitrification ammonification and nitrogen fixation are considered as important for the removal of complex nitrogen compounds in sewage treatment ammonia assimilation and nitrite nitrate ammonification related genes had the highest sequence numbers 902 and 915 respectively followed by denitrification 718 sequences dissimilatory nitrite reductase 205 sequences and nitrogen fixation 145 sequences moreover the phosphorus metabolism at level 2 of seed subsystems was quite remarkable with high affinity phosphate transporter 2645 reads and pho regulon 1080 reads having these functional genes which responsible for phosphorus removal could maintain the ebpr performance even under high temperature and high saline concentration as for the sulfur metabolism including sulfate reduction and sulfur oxidation bioprocesses the related functional genes were also identified with sulfate reduction associated genes and sulfur oxidation genes 448 and 399 reads respectively to our knowledge limited information is available on changes of microbial metabolisms metabolic processes e g p related metabolism in paos when communities experienced stress environments like high salinity temperature according to literature bassin et al 2011 welles et al 2014 salt concentration and duration of exposure significantly impact the competition between paos and gaos with paos being more sensitive to the increasing salinity level and longer exposure time bassin et al 2011 found that no p release or uptake at 33 g l nacl and the observation was fully matched with the pcr dgge fish based microbial analysis because no detection of paos candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis bacteria welles et al 2014 demonstrated that the maintenance energy requirement of paos increased to nearly 0 025 mol atp c mol h when the salinity concentration rose up to 2 on a w v basis as nacl moreover phosphate uptake rate decreased by 46 when salinity level increased from 0 to 0 18 w v in the present study the selected salinity level is 6 g l and the temperature is 30 c negatively affect conventional ebpr as reported by ong et al 2014 but the lab scale system can still perform ebpr over 100 days implying the potential of the development such sulfur centric ebpr process 3 3 2 cell sorting and verification of the putative spaos through the facs experiments the cells containing polyphosphates could be sorted out the results are shown in the fluorescence images fig 7 a before sorting the bright yellow cells were paos while the blue cells were other bacteria after sorting most of cells were paos as expected in addition the cell counts of the paos before and after the sorting process were 9 3 4 3 and 49 6 3 3 respectively furthermore the sorted sample was analyzed through high throughput sequencing and the key results were used to construct the phylogenetic tree fig 7b interestingly about half of the clones belong to an uncultured genus of alphaproteobacteria which is close to the rhodobacteraceae at the family level and thus it could be the paos in the new sebpr system finally this result coincides with that of the above metagenomics analysis the isolation and cultivation of the putative spaos and examination of their physiology deserve further study 4 conclusions this paper reports the impact of poly s on polyphosphates accumulation in a novel sebpr process specifically developed for the treatment of high temperature saline wastewater a set of chemical microscopic and microbial analyses were performed the sebpr system reached a p release of around 18 6 4 and a p uptake of around 26 5 6 7 mg p l resulting in an average p removal efficiency of 84 25 in batch tests no pha was synthesized but p uptake was observed and it was highly correlated with the intracellular poly s consumption this observation suggests that poly s could act as an intracellular energy source for p uptake and polyphosphates formation moreover microscopic clsm and tem images indicated the presence of intercellular polyphosphates and poly s metagenomic analysis revealed that proteobacteria 36 5 bacteroidetes 23 3 thermotogae 7 1 chloroflexi 4 5 and firmicutes 2 3 were the major phyla in bacteria enriched in the sebpr system the communities consisted of a reasonable population of srb 9 4 and denitrifying sob 8 0 the conventional paos of candidatus accumulibacter were found at only 0 32 abundance and the putative paos rhodobacteraceae are believed to be the key microorganisms which play significant role in p removal in the sebpr process the cell counts of the paos before and after the sorting process were 9 3 4 3 and 49 6 3 3 respectively together the findings of this research suggest that poly s

which will offer a crucial reference point for the correct evaluation of estrogen pollution in water bodies while guaranteeing wildlife and human health 2 catalytic performance of fungal laccase mediated humification reactions in aquatic ecosystems laccase p diphenol dioxygen oxidoreductases ec 1 10 3 2 is an extracellular multi copper oxidase widely distributed in microorganisms higher plants and insects bilal et al 2019 mate and alcalde 2017 this bioenzyme has the advantages of mild reaction conditions high catalytic performance simplicity cost effectiveness and environmental friendliness and has become an eco friendly substitute for conventional chemical reactions cha et al 2017 riva 2006 senthivelan et al 2016 l mhrs mainly include the oxidation of substrates by laccase electron transfer within the laccase the reduction of molecular oxygen by the laccase and the generation of coupling products beck et al 2018 su et al 2018 in this whole process of l mhrs laccase only uses molecular oxygen as an electron acceptor for the oxidation of substrates which presents significant cost saving additionally laccase is less harmful compared to peroxidases such as heme peroxidase lignin peroxidase and manganese dependent peroxidase which require enzyme destabilizing h2o2 to oxidize substrates bilal et al 2019 riva 2006 the existing literature indicates that laccases are mainly present in basidiomycetes ascomycetes and deuteromycetes and are particularly abundant in many white rot basidiomycete fungi kudanga et al 2011 tortella et al 2015 fungal laccase is a glycoprotein having an acidic isoelectric point with a molecular weight mw ranging from 40 to 110 kd and a degree of glycosylation accounting for 10 25 of the mw baldrian 2006 the redox potentials of fungal laccases typically range from 450 to 790 mv leading to their being extensively investigated for commercial and biotechnological applications catherine et al 2016 munk et al 2015 as shown in fig 2 a and b the reactive catalytic core of the fungal laccase contains a trinuclear copper cluster site in its structure i e one type 1 t1 copper one type 2 t2 copper and two type 3 t3 coppers the oxidation of substrates occurs at the t1 copper site and the extracted electrons are transferred by a his cys his tripeptide sequence to the t2 t3 copper site mate and alcalde 2017 currently the catalytic performance of these laccases is mainly detected via a colorimetric assay the affinity and catalytic efficiency of laccases for different substrates are reflected in their michaelis constant k m and maximal reaction velocity v max values de freitas et al 2017 lassouane et al 2019 it is well recognized that fungal l mhrs are advantageous to the removal of phenolic contaminants r oh in water bodies by stepwise polymerizing r oh to produce dimers trimers tetramers oligomers and polymers llevot et al 2016 sun et al 2016 su et al 2018 such a process can catalyze the single electron oxidation of four hydrogen donating r oh molecules at the t1 copper site to form four reactive radical intermediates 4r o resulting in the four electron reduction of molecular oxygen at the t2 t3 copper site into two water molecules fig 2c subsequently these radical intermediates can further undergo various spontaneous non enzymatic reactions to yield various complex polymeric structures via radical based coupling processes de freitas et al 2017 kudanga et al 2011 3 estrogen regulation and ha transformation during the coupling process of l mhrs the transformation efficiency and steady state kinetics of e2 ee2 and bpa in fungal l mhrs have been comprehensively researched arca ramos et al 2015 sun et al 2016 in the l mhrs process the electron donating functional groups of estrogens i e phenolic hydroxyl groups induce the electrophilic attack of the laccase resulting in the efficient oxidation of estrogen molecules which evidently reduces their estrogenic activity and ecotoxicity beck et al 2018 catherine et al 2016 de freitas et al 2017 the steady state kinetic parameters k m and v max are assessed using the following lineweaver burk formalism equation 1 1 1 v k m s v max s where v corresponds to the initial reaction velocity and s is the substrate concentration the catalytic constant k cat is calculated by dividing v max by the total enzyme concentration e t equation 2 2 k cat v max e t from our previous work and the cited relevant literature beck et al 2018 daÃ¢ssi et al 2016 qin et al 2014 sun et al 2016 the transformation pathways of e2 ee2 and bpa by fungal l mhrs have been proposed fig 3 fungal l mhrs can catalyze the single electron oxidation of estrogens without requiring any mediator to yield the corresponding reactive radical intermediates subsequently the two radical intermediates self couple to form various dimer isomers through a reactive radical mediated c c and c o c covalent binding mechanism at either the ortho or para position both linkages require the loss of two hydrogens leading to the loss of dimer mass by two units compared to a pair of estrogen monomers due to this self coupling pathway dimers develop that retain phenolic hydroxyl groups which nonetheless remain as laccase substrates that can continue coupling to generate self oligomers and self polymers the generation of self coupling products removes phenolic hydroxyl groups but increases ether groups in the polymeric structures dou et al 2018 sun et al 2019 hence the mw of estrogen self coupling products mwself can be calculated via equation 3 3 mw self a mw em 2 0158 a 1 whereby mwem is the mw of estrogen monomer 2 0158 is the atomic weight of two hydrogens and a corresponds to the number of estrogen units a 1 and a is an integer these polymerization products are usually insoluble and thus have a much lower bioavailablity and mobility than the parent compound and can be removed by centrifugation and filtration qin et al 2014 sun et al 2019 wang et al 2018 it follows that fungal l mhrs play an essential role in governing the transformation and fate of estrogens has can participate in single electron oxidation coupling reactions of estrogens in fungal l mhrs hence in these reactions the relationship between the transformation of estrogens and the dynamic variation of ha must be determined du et al 2016 singh et al 2015 sun et al 2016 ha can form several reactive intermediates in fungal l mhrs which spontaneously combine with the phenoxy radical intermediates of estrogens to generate estrogen ha cross coupling products li et al 2017 singh et al 2015 wang et al 2018 notably ha competes with estrogens at the reactive site of laccase which inhibits the self coupling reactions of estrogens in l mhrs nevertheless enhancing the cross coupling processes between estrogens and ha sun et al 2016 dou et al 2018 the factors influencing the yield and distribution proportion of cross coupling products are ph temperature metal ions and energy conditions du et al 2016 jeon et al 2012 su et al 2018 song et al 2019 however the existence of estrogen ha cross coupling products still lacks direct evidence partly because it is difficult to determine the structure of ha at the molecular level therefore it is imperative to identify the molecular masses elemental compositions and molecular formulas of unknown cross coupling products between estrogens and ha in fungal l mhrs this may benefit ecological restoration measures that use humification reactions to reduce the biotoxicity of estrogens in natural aquatic environments 4 identification of estrogen ha cross coupling products by high resolution mass spectrometry combined with 13c isotope labeling the elucidation of the covalent binding site and formation process of estrogen ha cross coupling products and their stability in the environment by fungal l mhrs is a requirement for the ecological risk assessment of estrogens this provides a theoretical basis for humification reaction based ecological restoration measures in aquatic ecosystems given the complexity and uncertainty of ha molecular structure researchers generally use aromatic small molecule humic precursors to imitate the reactivity of ha which is aimed at revealing the binding site formation process and environmental stability of estrogen ha cross coupling products du et al 2016 gao et al 2018 hilgers et al 2018 jeon et al 2012 the functional groups of humic precursors the types of estrogens as well as ph temperature and metal ions are influencing factors in the stability of cross coupling products in the environments estrogens and ha are cross coupled by forming c c c o c or c n c bonds at either the ortho or para position to create stable humic substances which lower the biotoxicity of estrogens and accelerate the preservation of organic carbon and nitrogen in aquatic environments du et al 2016 sun et al 2016 tong et al 2016 varga et al 2019 however identification of the unknown cross coupling products between estrogens and ha in fungal l mhrs is still a hot topic that needs to be solved early reports have shown that spectral analysis and chromatography can be used to characterize the molecular size distribution and chemical structure of estrogen ha cross coupling products dou et al 2018 lisov et al 2019 for instance the conformational change and size distribution of ha have been detected using uv vis spectroscopy in combination with high performance size exclusion chromatography sun et al 2016 tong et al 2016 these results have shown that not only can ha be recombined to generate macromolecule humic substances but also can be combined with the phenolic hydroxyl of estrogen to yield cross coupling products song et al 2019 dou et al 2018 have revealed that using ftir and 13c nmr the ha can be self coupled through reactive radical mediated c o c and c n c covalent bonding in fungal l mhrs the mw of estrogen ha cross coupling products may be higher than the mw of ha self coupling products li et al 2013 unfortunately these techniques cannot analyze and identify unknown cross coupling products between estrogens and ha at the molecular level mainly due to the structural complexity of humic species recent advances in the development of high resolution mass spectrometry hrms combined with 13c isotope labeling have been exploited in the identification of the molecular masses and elemental compositions of previously unidentified estrogen ha cross coupling products in fungal l mhrs kolkman et al 2015 sun et al 2016 tian et al 2018 simultaneously in combination with 13c nmr the possible chemical structures of cross coupling products have been presented when compared with conventional mass spectrometry hrms is more advanced due to its accurate mass measurement m z high resolving power and full scan sensitivity over a broad m z range thereby carrying out the identification of suspected or unknown elemental compositions and chemical structures unambiguously giavalisco et al 2008 hicks et al 2015 rezaei et al 2018 additionally measurements made using 13c stable isotope labeling help to effectively reduce matrix effects which improves the accuracy and reproducibility of hrms meissen et al 2016 this identification of undiscovered cross coupling products is performed using the following five rules 1 13 c isotope labeling in combination with mass measurement by hrms hrms can measure the molecular masses of unidentified estrogen ha cross coupling products to the fourth decimal point mass error 5 ppm moreover 13c isotope labeling combined with hrms improves the reliability in the molecular masses of these products giavalisco et al 2008 sun et al 2016 thus the elemental compositions and molecular formulas of unknown cross coupling products may be directly assigned by hrms and element analysis this method possesses the unique capability to distinguish the molecular formulas of unknown products 2 the accurate difference in molecular mass Î´mm between the monoisotopic m z peak and its corresponding isotope peaks in laccase mediated humification coupling reactions a mixture of the monoisotopic estrogen and the 13cn labeled estrogen n 0 and n is an integer is created in a 1 1 m ratio thus the monoisotopic m z peak has corresponding isotope peaks that are 1 0033n mm 1 0033n heavier because of the existence of n13c labeled carbon atoms between the monoisotopic estrogen and the 13cn labeled estrogen and the mm between 13c and 12c is 1 0033 neumann et al 2014 zhao et al 2016 3 the relative intensity ratios rirs between the monoisotopic m z peak and its corresponding isotope peaks it is expected that the rirs of unknown cross coupling products between the monoisotopic peak and its isotope labeled counterparts are 1 1 for monomers contains zero or one 13cn labeled estrogen 1 2 1 for dimers contains zero one or two 13cn labeled estrogens and 1 3 3 1 for trimers contains zero one two or three 13cn labeled estrogens respectively sun et al 2016 for instance three estrogen molecules can be randomly coupled with ha to form estrogen 3 ha cross coupling product by fungal l mhrs starting with a 1 1 m ratio of the monoisotopic estrogen and the 13cn labeled estrogen this coupling product may contain no 13cn labeled estrogens one 13cn labeled estrogen and two 13cn unlabeled estrogens two 13cn labeled estrogens and one 13cn unlabeled estrogen or three 13cn labeled estrogens thus the rirs of unknown cross coupling products formed by the monoisotopic and 13cn labeled estrogens coupled randomly with ha contains m 13cn labeled estrogens can be calculated from the following binomial coefficients c m r m r m r equation 4 4 rirs c m 0 c m 1 c m 2 c m 3 c m m 3 c m m 2 c m m 1 c m r where r numerically represents the r 1 terms of the binomial expansion r 0 1 2 3 m m corresponds to the number of estrogen monomers in cross coupling products and m is m factorial m 1 2 3 m however the rirs may deviate from theoretical values mainly due to the natural abundance of 13c 1 11 the 13cn labeled estrogen is 98 99 isotopically enriched and matrix effects ion suppression and instrument drifts cause errors that can lead to variations in the rirs chekmeneva et al 2017 huan and li 2015 kawasaki et al 2009 therefore these error ranges need to be explained further on account of the actual determination values i e the rirs of estrogen self coupling products between the monoisotopic peak and its isotope labeled counterparts 4 the molecular mass of cross coupling products between estrogens and ha the molecular mass of the cross coupling products formed by estrogen couples with ha or estrogen couples with low molecular mass phenolic compounds released from ha in l mhrs is greater than the molecular mass of estrogen 5 the cross coupling product m z peak does not appear in the blank control samples the possible estrogen ha cross coupling products are identified using the isotope ratio as a tracer moreover an in house matlab program is used to assist in screening the m z peaks that meet the above five rules hrms spectra and rirs of estrogen ha cross coupling products and their isotope labeled counterparts are shown in fig 4 such a method combining hrms and isotope labeling provides a novel means for identifying the molecular masses elemental compositions and molecular formulas of unknown estrogen ha cross coupling products in reaction systems involving ha simultaneously the chemical structure characteristics of cross coupling products are further analyzed by 13c nmr hrms combined with 13c isotope labeling and 13c nmr allow one to thoroughly probe the binding site formation process and environmental stability of covalent bonds in unknown estrogen ha cross coupling products formed by fungal l mhrs 5 coupling process and mechanism for single electron oxidation of estrogens and ha in fungal l mhrs based on the relevant citations dou et al 2018 decostanzi et al 2019 jeon and chang 2013 sun et al 2016 su et al 2019 the self cross coupling process and mechanism for single electron oxidation of estrogens and ha in aquatic ecosystems by fungal l mhrs is well understood as shown in fig 5 estrogens and or ha are initially oxidized to yield reactive radical intermediates i e estrogen and ha see equations 5 and 6 a note that the charge density in estrogens and ha at phenolic hydroxyl is more accessible to electron extraction than at other positions whereby losing an electron to laccase produces a large quantity of phenoxy radical intermediates beck et al 2018 qin et al 2014 wang et al 2018 subsequently three alternative coupling pathways between estrogen and ha occur outside the laccase reactive site where the coupling is statistically random the first two coupling pathways are that estrogen and or ha are stepwise self polymerized to produce distinct oligomeric isomers equations 7 and 8 beck et al 2018 daÃ¢ssi et al 2016 sun et al 2016 these oligomers are also further self coupled to form polymers if mass transfer and saturation do not impede access of such species to the laccase catalytic reactive site jeon and chang 2013 kudanga et al 2011 su et al 2019 the self oligomers and self polymers of estrogen and or ha are much less water soluble and bioavailable than the parent compound and are easily separated from the liquid phase by precipitation and filtration beck et al 2018 qin et al 2014 sun et al 2019 notably the third coupling pathway is that estrogen is coupled with ha to form the products of estrogen ha cross coupling via reactive radical mediated c c c o c or c n c covalent bond formation kudanga et al 2017 singh et al 2015 sun et al 2016 zille et al 2005 compared with estrogen the phenoxy radical intermediates of ha theoretically possess more intricate resonance effects tong et al 2016 high aromaticity of ha is beneficial to the stabilization of radicals and thus has a higher possibility for reacting with estrogen to produce estrogen ha cross coupling products these cross coupling products may contain one estrogen molecule and one humic molecule equation 9 one estrogen molecule and two humic molecules equation 10 two estrogen molecules and one humic molecule equation 11 two estrogen molecules and two humic molecules equation 12 etc castro et al 2019 decostanzi et al 2019 gao et al 2018 jeon and chang 2013 riva 2006 therefore the formation of various cross coupling products can be explained by the local concentrations of each of the radical intermediates and their rates of production additionally different reaction conditions can also alter the geometry of the laccase reactive site thus affecting cross coupling products generation su et al 2019 tobimatsu and schuetz 2019 5 estrogen laccase estrogen 6 ha laccase ha 7 estrogen estrogen 2 estrogen 3 estrogen 4 estrogen n precipitate 8 ha ha 2 ha 3 ha 4 ha n precipitate 9 estrogen ha estrogen ha 10 estrogen ha 2 estrogen ha 2 11 estrogen 2 ha estrogen 2 ha 12 estrogen 2 ha 2 estrogen 2 ha 2 the generation of estrogen ha cross coupling products alters the product distribution transformation pathway and ecotoxicity of estrogens dou et al 2018 gao et al 2018 li et al 2013 luo et al 2018 varga et al 2019 for example sun et al 2016 have revealed that the formation of estrogen ha cross coupling products gives rise to the formation of fewer estrogen self coupling products particularly high degree self polymers other studies have demonstrated that estrogen self coupling is faster than ha self coupling at the initial reaction stage which results in most of the estrogens forming self coupling products while these self coupling products can be incorporated into ha to form estrogen ha cross coupling products in the latter stage of the reaction li et al 2013 the difference in bond strength may be confirmed by comparing c c c o c and c n c bond dissociation energies bdes in different estrogen ha self cross coupling products for example the c c bde is dramatically higher than the c o c bde in coupling products revealing the formation of c c bond is more favorable owing to the c o c bond cleavage is easier than the c c beck et al 2018 qin et al 2014 wang et al 2018 regarding the removal of estrogenic activity of e2 ee2 and bpa many studies have reported that the generated self cross coupling products between estrogens and ha present much less bioavailablity and mobility than the parent compound catherine et al 2016 li et al 2013 mao et al 2010 spina et al 2015 wang et al 2018 for instance kodama et al 2018 have documented that halophenols can be incorporated into ha as the integral components of ha during fungal l mhrs via the cross coupling of radical species and that the ecotoxicity of such products is markedly lower compared to the parent compound despite this the stabilities and potential risk of estrogens and ha self cross coupling products should be carefully determined in future studies decostanzi et al 2019 li et al 2013 sun et al 2016 tong et al 2016 these findings will have significant ramifications in the accurate assessment of the cross coupling mechanism for single electron oxidation of estrogens and ha in fungal l mhrs this may benefit ecological restoration measures that are based on using humification reactions to alleviate the biotoxicity of estrogens in natural aquatic environments 6 conclusion fungal laccase is an extracellular oxidase that contains a trinuclear copper cluster active site t1 t2 and t3 in its catalytic core it is well documented that fungal l mhrs are an environmentally friendly biotechnological alternative in the catalysis of covalent coupling reactions of estrogens and ha this review summarizes the use of fungal l mhrs in the single electron oxidation of estrogens and ha to generate macromolecular self cross coupling products via reactive radical mediated c c c o c or c n c covalent binding mechanisms at either the ortho or para carbon position compared to chemical oxidation and biodegradation fungal l mhrs not only reduce the ecotoxicity of estrogens but also promote the preservation of organic carbon and nitrogen in the environments the findings from hrms combined with 13c isotope labeling and 13c nmr may provide a unique and accurate assessment of the molecular formulas and chemical structures of unknown cross coupling products between estrogens and ha in fungal l mhrs although it is expected that the biotoxicity of estrogens will be reduced by these approaches outstanding questions arise in the adoption of fungal l mhrs in ecological restoration strategies hence future research should focus on 1 investigating estrogens and ha transformation kinetics to determine the effect of ha on the k m v max and k cat of estrogens transformation 2 identifying undiscovered estrogen ha cross coupling products to reveal the distribution characteristics and regularity of such products 3 exploiting hrms combined with 13c isotope labeling technologies to determine the binding site formation process and environmental stability of covalent bonds in estrogen

mediated humification reactions in aquatic ecosystems laccase p diphenol dioxygen oxidoreductases ec 1 10 3 2 is an extracellular multi copper oxidase widely distributed in microorganisms higher plants and insects bilal et al 2019 mate and alcalde 2017 this bioenzyme has the advantages of mild reaction conditions high catalytic performance simplicity cost effectiveness and environmental friendliness and has become an eco friendly substitute for conventional chemical reactions cha et al 2017 riva 2006 senthivelan et al 2016 l mhrs mainly include the oxidation of substrates by laccase electron transfer within the laccase the reduction of molecular oxygen by the laccase and the generation of coupling products beck et al 2018 su et al 2018 in this whole process of l mhrs laccase only uses molecular oxygen as an electron acceptor for the oxidation of substrates which presents significant cost saving additionally laccase is less harmful compared to peroxidases such as heme peroxidase lignin peroxidase and manganese dependent peroxidase which require enzyme destabilizing h2o2 to oxidize substrates bilal et al 2019 riva 2006 the existing literature indicates that laccases are mainly present in basidiomycetes ascomycetes and deuteromycetes and are particularly abundant in many white rot basidiomycete fungi kudanga et al 2011 tortella et al 2015 fungal laccase is a glycoprotein having an acidic isoelectric point with a molecular weight mw ranging from 40 to 110 kd and a degree of glycosylation accounting for 10 25 of the mw baldrian 2006 the redox potentials of fungal laccases typically range from 450 to 790 mv leading to their being extensively investigated for commercial and biotechnological applications catherine et al 2016 munk et al 2015 as shown in fig 2 a and b the reactive catalytic core of the fungal laccase contains a trinuclear copper cluster site in its structure i e one type 1 t1 copper one type 2 t2 copper and two type 3 t3 coppers the oxidation of substrates occurs at the t1 copper site and the extracted electrons are transferred by a his cys his tripeptide sequence to the t2 t3 copper site mate and alcalde 2017 currently the catalytic performance of these laccases is mainly detected via a colorimetric assay the affinity and catalytic efficiency of laccases for different substrates are reflected in their michaelis constant k m and maximal reaction velocity v max values de freitas et al 2017 lassouane et al 2019 it is well recognized that fungal l mhrs are advantageous to the removal of phenolic contaminants r oh in water bodies by stepwise polymerizing r oh to produce dimers trimers tetramers oligomers and polymers llevot et al 2016 sun et al 2016 su et al 2018 such a process can catalyze the single electron oxidation of four hydrogen donating r oh molecules at the t1 copper site to form four reactive radical intermediates 4r o resulting in the four electron reduction of molecular oxygen at the t2 t3 copper site into two water molecules fig 2c subsequently these radical intermediates can further undergo various spontaneous non enzymatic reactions to yield various complex polymeric structures via radical based coupling processes de freitas et al 2017 kudanga et al 2011 3 estrogen regulation and ha transformation during the coupling process of l mhrs the transformation efficiency and steady state kinetics of e2 ee2 and bpa in fungal l mhrs have been comprehensively researched arca ramos et al 2015 sun et al 2016 in the l mhrs process the electron donating functional groups of estrogens i e phenolic hydroxyl groups induce the electrophilic attack of the laccase resulting in the efficient oxidation of estrogen molecules which evidently reduces their estrogenic activity and ecotoxicity beck et al 2018 catherine et al 2016 de freitas et al 2017 the steady state kinetic parameters k m and v max are assessed using the following lineweaver burk formalism equation 1 1 1 v k m s v max s where v corresponds to the initial reaction velocity and s is the substrate concentration the catalytic constant k cat is calculated by dividing v max by the total enzyme concentration e t equation 2 2 k cat v max e t from our previous work and the cited relevant literature beck et al 2018 daÃ¢ssi et al 2016 qin et al 2014 sun et al 2016 the transformation pathways of e2 ee2 and bpa by fungal l mhrs have been proposed fig 3 fungal l mhrs can catalyze the single electron oxidation of estrogens without requiring any mediator to yield the corresponding reactive radical intermediates subsequently the two radical intermediates self couple to form various dimer isomers through a reactive radical mediated c c and c o c covalent binding mechanism at either the ortho or para position both linkages require the loss of two hydrogens leading to the loss of dimer mass by two units compared to a pair of estrogen monomers due to this self coupling pathway dimers develop that retain phenolic hydroxyl groups which nonetheless remain as laccase substrates that can continue coupling to generate self oligomers and self polymers the generation of self coupling products removes phenolic hydroxyl groups but increases ether groups in the polymeric structures dou et al 2018 sun et al 2019 hence the mw of estrogen self coupling products mwself can be calculated via equation 3 3 mw self a mw em 2 0158 a 1 whereby mwem is the mw of estrogen monomer 2 0158 is the atomic weight of two hydrogens and a corresponds to the number of estrogen units a 1 and a is an integer these polymerization products are usually insoluble and thus have a much lower bioavailablity and mobility than the parent compound and can be removed by centrifugation and filtration qin et al 2014 sun et al 2019 wang et al 2018 it follows that fungal l mhrs play an essential role in governing the transformation and fate of estrogens has can participate in single electron oxidation coupling reactions of estrogens in fungal l mhrs hence in these reactions the relationship between the transformation of estrogens and the dynamic variation of ha must be determined du et al 2016 singh et al 2015 sun et al 2016 ha can form several reactive intermediates in fungal l mhrs which spontaneously combine with the phenoxy radical intermediates of estrogens to generate estrogen ha cross coupling products li et al 2017 singh et al 2015 wang et al 2018 notably ha competes with estrogens at the reactive site of laccase which inhibits the self coupling reactions of estrogens in l mhrs nevertheless enhancing the cross coupling processes between estrogens and ha sun et al 2016 dou et al 2018 the factors influencing the yield and distribution proportion of cross coupling products are ph temperature metal ions and energy conditions du et al 2016 jeon et al 2012 su et al 2018 song et al 2019 however the existence of estrogen ha cross coupling products still lacks direct evidence partly because it is difficult to determine the structure of ha at the molecular level therefore it is imperative to identify the molecular masses elemental compositions and molecular formulas of unknown cross coupling products between estrogens and ha in fungal l mhrs this may benefit ecological restoration measures that use humification reactions to reduce the biotoxicity of estrogens in natural aquatic environments 4 identification of estrogen ha cross coupling products by high resolution mass spectrometry combined with 13c isotope labeling the elucidation of the covalent binding site and formation process of estrogen ha cross coupling products and their stability in the environment by fungal l mhrs is a requirement for the ecological risk assessment of estrogens this provides a theoretical basis for humification reaction based ecological restoration measures in aquatic ecosystems given the complexity and uncertainty of ha molecular structure researchers generally use aromatic small molecule humic precursors to imitate the reactivity of ha which is aimed at revealing the binding site formation process and environmental stability of estrogen ha cross coupling products du et al 2016 gao et al 2018 hilgers et al 2018 jeon et al 2012 the functional groups of humic precursors the types of estrogens as well as ph temperature and metal ions are influencing factors in the stability of cross coupling products in the environments estrogens and ha are cross coupled by forming c c c o c or c n c bonds at either the ortho or para position to create stable humic substances which lower the biotoxicity of estrogens and accelerate the preservation of organic carbon and nitrogen in aquatic environments du et al 2016 sun et al 2016 tong et al 2016 varga et al 2019 however identification of the unknown cross coupling products between estrogens and ha in fungal l mhrs is still a hot topic that needs to be solved early reports have shown that spectral analysis and chromatography can be used to characterize the molecular size distribution and chemical structure of estrogen ha cross coupling products dou et al 2018 lisov et al 2019 for instance the conformational change and size distribution of ha have been detected using uv vis spectroscopy in combination with high performance size exclusion chromatography sun et al 2016 tong et al 2016 these results have shown that not only can ha be recombined to generate macromolecule humic substances but also can be combined with the phenolic hydroxyl of estrogen to yield cross coupling products song et al 2019 dou et al 2018 have revealed that using ftir and 13c nmr the ha can be self coupled through reactive radical mediated c o c and c n c covalent bonding in fungal l mhrs the mw of estrogen ha cross coupling products may be higher than the mw of ha self coupling products li et al 2013 unfortunately these techniques cannot analyze and identify unknown cross coupling products between estrogens and ha at the molecular level mainly due to the structural complexity of humic species recent advances in the development of high resolution mass spectrometry hrms combined with 13c isotope labeling have been exploited in the identification of the molecular masses and elemental compositions of previously unidentified estrogen ha cross coupling products in fungal l mhrs kolkman et al 2015 sun et al 2016 tian et al 2018 simultaneously in combination with 13c nmr the possible chemical structures of cross coupling products have been presented when compared with conventional mass spectrometry hrms is more advanced due to its accurate mass measurement m z high resolving power and full scan sensitivity over a broad m z range thereby carrying out the identification of suspected or unknown elemental compositions and chemical structures unambiguously giavalisco et al 2008 hicks et al 2015 rezaei et al 2018 additionally measurements made using 13c stable isotope labeling help to effectively reduce matrix effects which improves the accuracy and reproducibility of hrms meissen et al 2016 this identification of undiscovered cross coupling products is performed using the following five rules 1 13 c isotope labeling in combination with mass measurement by hrms hrms can measure the molecular masses of unidentified estrogen ha cross coupling products to the fourth decimal point mass error 5 ppm moreover 13c isotope labeling combined with hrms improves the reliability in the molecular masses of these products giavalisco et al 2008 sun et al 2016 thus the elemental compositions and molecular formulas of unknown cross coupling products may be directly assigned by hrms and element analysis this method possesses the unique capability to distinguish the molecular formulas of unknown products 2 the accurate difference in molecular mass Î´mm between the monoisotopic m z peak and its corresponding isotope peaks in laccase mediated humification coupling reactions a mixture of the monoisotopic estrogen and the 13cn labeled estrogen n 0 and n is an integer is created in a 1 1 m ratio thus the monoisotopic m z peak has corresponding isotope peaks that are 1 0033n mm 1 0033n heavier because of the existence of n13c labeled carbon atoms between the monoisotopic estrogen and the 13cn labeled estrogen and the mm between 13c and 12c is 1 0033 neumann et al 2014 zhao et al 2016 3 the relative intensity ratios rirs between the monoisotopic m z peak and its corresponding isotope peaks it is expected that the rirs of unknown cross coupling products between the monoisotopic peak and its isotope labeled counterparts are 1 1 for monomers contains zero or one 13cn labeled estrogen 1 2 1 for dimers contains zero one or two 13cn labeled estrogens and 1 3 3 1 for trimers contains zero one two or three 13cn labeled estrogens respectively sun et al 2016 for instance three estrogen molecules can be randomly coupled with ha to form estrogen 3 ha cross coupling product by fungal l mhrs starting with a 1 1 m ratio of the monoisotopic estrogen and the 13cn labeled estrogen this coupling product may contain no 13cn labeled estrogens one 13cn labeled estrogen and two 13cn unlabeled estrogens two 13cn labeled estrogens and one 13cn unlabeled estrogen or three 13cn labeled estrogens thus the rirs of unknown cross coupling products formed by the monoisotopic and 13cn labeled estrogens coupled randomly with ha contains m 13cn labeled estrogens can be calculated from the following binomial coefficients c m r m r m r equation 4 4 rirs c m 0 c m 1 c m 2 c m 3 c m m 3 c m m 2 c m m 1 c m r where r numerically represents the r 1 terms of the binomial expansion r 0 1 2 3 m m corresponds to the number of estrogen monomers in cross coupling products and m is m factorial m 1 2 3 m however the rirs may deviate from theoretical values mainly due to the natural abundance of 13c 1 11 the 13cn labeled estrogen is 98 99 isotopically enriched and matrix effects ion suppression and instrument drifts cause errors that can lead to variations in the rirs chekmeneva et al 2017 huan and li 2015 kawasaki et al 2009 therefore these error ranges need to be explained further on account of the actual determination values i e the rirs of estrogen self coupling products between the monoisotopic peak and its isotope labeled counterparts 4 the molecular mass of cross coupling products between estrogens and ha the molecular mass of the cross coupling products formed by estrogen couples with ha or estrogen couples with low molecular mass phenolic compounds released from ha in l mhrs is greater than the molecular mass of estrogen 5 the cross coupling product m z peak does not appear in the blank control samples the possible estrogen ha cross coupling products are identified using the isotope ratio as a tracer moreover an in house matlab program is used to assist in screening the m z peaks that meet the above five rules hrms spectra and rirs of estrogen ha cross coupling products and their isotope labeled counterparts are shown in fig 4 such a method combining hrms and isotope labeling provides a novel means for identifying the molecular masses elemental compositions and molecular formulas of unknown estrogen ha cross coupling products in reaction systems involving ha simultaneously the chemical structure characteristics of cross coupling products are further analyzed by 13c nmr hrms combined with 13c isotope labeling and 13c nmr allow one to thoroughly probe the binding site formation process and environmental stability of covalent bonds in unknown estrogen ha cross coupling products formed by fungal l mhrs 5 coupling process and mechanism for single electron oxidation of estrogens and ha in fungal l mhrs based on the relevant citations dou et al 2018 decostanzi et al 2019 jeon and chang 2013 sun et al 2016 su et al 2019 the self cross coupling process and mechanism for single electron oxidation of estrogens and ha in aquatic ecosystems by fungal l mhrs is well understood as shown in fig 5 estrogens and or ha are initially oxidized to yield reactive radical intermediates i e estrogen and ha see equations 5 and 6 a note that the charge density in estrogens and ha at phenolic hydroxyl is more accessible to electron extraction than at other positions whereby losing an electron to laccase produces a large quantity of phenoxy radical intermediates beck et al 2018 qin et al 2014 wang et al 2018 subsequently three alternative coupling pathways between estrogen and ha occur outside the laccase reactive site where the coupling is statistically random the first two coupling pathways are that estrogen and or ha are stepwise self polymerized to produce distinct oligomeric isomers equations 7 and 8 beck et al 2018 daÃ¢ssi et al 2016 sun et al 2016 these oligomers are also further self coupled to form polymers if mass transfer and saturation do not impede access of such species to the laccase catalytic reactive site jeon and chang 2013 kudanga et al 2011 su et al 2019 the self oligomers and self polymers of estrogen and or ha are much less water soluble and bioavailable than the parent compound and are easily separated from the liquid phase by precipitation and filtration beck et al 2018 qin et al 2014 sun et al 2019 notably the third coupling pathway is that estrogen is coupled with ha to form the products of estrogen ha cross coupling via reactive radical mediated c c c o c or c n c covalent bond formation kudanga et al 2017 singh et al 2015 sun et al 2016 zille et al 2005 compared with estrogen the phenoxy radical intermediates of ha theoretically possess more intricate resonance effects tong et al 2016 high aromaticity of ha is beneficial to the stabilization of radicals and thus has a higher possibility for reacting with estrogen to produce estrogen ha cross coupling products these cross coupling products may contain one estrogen molecule and one humic molecule equation 9 one estrogen molecule and two humic molecules equation 10 two estrogen molecules and one humic molecule equation 11 two estrogen molecules and two humic molecules equation 12 etc castro et al 2019 decostanzi et al 2019 gao et al 2018 jeon and chang 2013 riva 2006 therefore the formation of various cross coupling products can be explained by the local concentrations of each of the radical intermediates and their rates of production additionally different reaction conditions can also alter the geometry of the laccase reactive site thus affecting cross coupling products generation su et al 2019 tobimatsu and schuetz 2019 5 estrogen laccase estrogen 6 ha laccase ha 7 estrogen estrogen 2 estrogen 3 estrogen 4 estrogen n precipitate 8 ha ha 2 ha 3 ha 4 ha n precipitate 9 estrogen ha estrogen ha 10 estrogen ha 2 estrogen ha 2 11 estrogen 2 ha estrogen 2 ha 12 estrogen 2 ha 2 estrogen 2 ha 2 the generation of estrogen ha cross coupling products alters the product distribution transformation pathway and ecotoxicity of estrogens dou et al 2018 gao et al 2018 li et al 2013 luo et al 2018 varga et al 2019 for example sun et al 2016 have revealed that the formation of estrogen ha cross coupling products gives rise to the formation of fewer estrogen self coupling products particularly high degree self polymers other studies have demonstrated that estrogen self coupling is faster than ha self coupling at the initial reaction stage which results in most of the estrogens forming self coupling products while these self coupling products can be incorporated into ha to form estrogen ha cross coupling products in the latter stage of the reaction li et al 2013 the difference in bond strength may be confirmed by comparing c c c o c and c n c bond dissociation energies bdes in different estrogen ha self cross coupling products for example the c c bde is dramatically higher than the c o c bde in coupling products revealing the formation of c c bond is more favorable owing to the c o c bond cleavage is easier than the c c beck et al 2018 qin et al 2014 wang et al 2018 regarding the removal of estrogenic activity of e2 ee2 and bpa many studies have reported that the generated self cross coupling products between estrogens and ha present much less bioavailablity and mobility than the parent compound catherine et al 2016 li et al 2013 mao et al 2010 spina et al 2015 wang et al 2018 for instance kodama et al 2018 have documented that halophenols can be incorporated into ha as the integral components of ha during fungal l mhrs via the cross coupling of radical species and that the ecotoxicity of such products is markedly lower compared to the parent compound despite this the stabilities and potential risk of estrogens and ha self cross coupling products should be carefully determined in future studies decostanzi et al 2019 li et al 2013 sun et al 2016 tong et al 2016 these findings will have significant ramifications in the accurate assessment of the cross coupling mechanism for single electron oxidation of estrogens and ha in fungal l mhrs this may benefit ecological restoration measures that are based on using humification reactions to alleviate the biotoxicity of estrogens in natural aquatic environments 6 conclusion fungal laccase is an extracellular oxidase that contains a trinuclear copper cluster active site t1 t2 and t3 in its catalytic core it is well documented that fungal l mhrs are an environmentally friendly biotechnological alternative in the catalysis of covalent coupling reactions of estrogens and ha this review summarizes the use of fungal l mhrs in the single electron oxidation of estrogens and ha to generate macromolecular self cross coupling products via reactive radical mediated c c c o c or c n c covalent binding mechanisms at either the ortho or para carbon position compared to chemical oxidation and biodegradation fungal l mhrs not only reduce the ecotoxicity of estrogens but also promote the preservation of organic carbon and nitrogen in the environments the findings from hrms combined with 13c isotope labeling and 13c nmr may provide a unique and accurate assessment of the molecular formulas and chemical structures of unknown cross coupling products between estrogens and ha in fungal l mhrs although it is expected that the biotoxicity of estrogens will be reduced by these approaches outstanding questions arise in the adoption of fungal l mhrs in ecological restoration strategies hence future research should focus on 1 investigating estrogens and ha transformation kinetics to determine the effect of ha on the k m v max and k cat of estrogens transformation 2 identifying undiscovered estrogen ha cross coupling products to reveal the distribution characteristics and regularity of such products 3 exploiting hrms combined with 13c isotope labeling technologies to determine the binding site formation process and environmental stability of covalent bonds in estrogen ha cross coupling products 4 altering the reaction conditions and modifying the laccase in fungal l mhrs to control the formation of estrogen and ha self cross coupling products 5 the real time implementation of fungal l mhrs in water ecosystems under real world reaction conditions temperature ph metal ions ha among others declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have
