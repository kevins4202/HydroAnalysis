available in literature and the amounts discharged into freshwater have been poorly investigated to obtain a better understanding the occurrence abundance and composition of the macrolitter in screened materials from stormwater were investigated at a small residential suburban catchment sucy en brie france in greater paris the macrolitter particularly the plastic debris was sorted weighed and classified based on the ospar methodology on average plastics accounted for at least 62 in number and for 53 of the mass of all the anthropogenic waste found in the screened materials the most

quantitative model of plastic fluxes in urban areas the high variability of the results and the lack of clear explanatory factors impede the ability to derive definitive conclusions on macrolitter particularly plastic debris fluxes blettler et al 2018 this study focused on the plastic debris fluxes in the urban runoff at the outlet of a small urban catchment in a paris suburb this study aims to i provide data on the composition of the macrolitter in the runoff water of a small urban catchment ii assess the mass percentages of macrolitter particularly plastic debris and iii estimate the plastic debris mass fluxes per hectare of impervious area and per capita and extrapolate those figures to the scale of greater paris 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling site samples were collected at the outflow of the sucy en brie watershed which were located in a suburban environment in the southeast portion of the paris agglomeration figure 1 it has a surface area of 228 ha with an impervious area of 62 ha which represents 27 of the catchment gasperi et al 2017 the population of the territory is approximately 5 700 which is mostly residential with an individual household density of approximately 25 cap ha 1 that corresponds to a moderately dense urban area in france gasperi et al 2017 commercial and professional activities are limited the sewer system in this catchment is a separated one i e wastewater and stormwater are collected separately a stormwater treatment structure is located at the catchment outflow which consists of a stormwater retention pond and a lamellar settling tank to block larger debris from entering the treatment structure a 6 cm screen s6cm and a 1 cm screen s1cm are installed in upstream retention ponds this type of stormwater treatment structure of separate sewer system is rare in greater paris and crucial for our experiments as it traps macrolitter from sucy en brie catchment debris collected by these screens is automatically deposited into trash containers one container per screen which enables the screened materials to be differentiated by the type of screen the accumulated debris on the two screens was used in this study to investigate macrolitter abundance and composition additionally the stormwater treatment structure is well instrumented for urban water study stormwater flow rates and volumes through the screens were measured by utilizing flowmeters druck ptx1830 and druck ptx5032 and provided by the val de marne environmental and sanitation services directorate dsea these measurements were utilized to estimate the macrolitter concentrations 2 2 sampling method eleven sampling campaigns were performed between april 2018 and april 2019 to collect the screened materials from s6cm and s1cm under different hydrological conditions figure 2 during each campaign samples of the screened materials accumulated in trash containers of each of the screens were collected and weighed and the initial waste volume for each trash container was estimated before and after sampling the densities of the samples were then estimated using volume and weight the samples were homogenised and a subsample was randomly collected and weighed 10 of the initial sample mass which corresponds to 3 6 kg the subsamples were then dried and sorted to study the variations in the macrolitter and plastic compositions see section 3 the last two campaigns were performed in triplicate to study intra sample variability and to assess the robustness of the analytical procedure 2 3 analytical procedure the collected debris had a high water content 70 of the initial mass therefore the subsamples were dried in an oven at 40 c for at least 10 d after which the dry debris was weighed and visually sorted the first four campaigns focused only on plastic waste and cigarette butts however all during the following campaigns other anthropogenic items aluminium cans healthcare waste etc larger than 5 mm were classified using the ospar classification ospar comission 2010 additionally items were weighed according to their waste category plastics metals sanitary and medical waste and other anthropogenic waste composite waste glass cardboard etc in this study sanitary and medical waste included items in ospar classifications 97 98 99 100 102 and 105 for the plastics category only synthetic materials were considered artificial and composite materials were considered separately to enable a better distinction between materials therefore cigarette butts were not included in the plastic category an additional category non plastic anthropogenic waste has been defined as all anthropogenic waste excepted plastic items which combines metals sanitary and medical waste and other anthropogenic waste using the stormwater volumes the mass percentages of the different subsamples were extrapolated to the initial debris volume to estimate plastic debris concentrations in the stormwater 2 4 calculation of plastic debris flux in stormwater two methods were used to estimate the annual plastic debris mass in the screened materials namely i using the estimated plastic debris concentration in stormwater and the annual stormwater volume methodconcentration and ii using the mean tonnage of the screened materials accumulated from 2015 to 2019 and the mean plastic mass percentage estimated by this study methodannual mass for methodconcentration the results of the analytical procedure presented in section 3 were used to calculate the plastic debris concentrations in the stormwater n 11 the mean and median values were then multiplied by the annual stormwater volume filtered through the screens from april 2018 to april 2019 consequently the plastic debris mass in the screened materials was obtained for methodannual mass waste mass percentages in the subsamples were directly applied to the annual tonnage of the screened materials collected by a company responsible for its incineration for this study it was assumed that the plastic mass percentage was constant over the last five years and the dsea provided screened materials tonnage estimations from 2015 to 2019 the plastic debris masses determined by both methods were then normalised to the impervious surface area of the catchment and population which yielded two different ratios ratioarea and ratiocap expressed in kg yr 1 ha 1 and g yr 1 cap 1 respectively 3 results 3 1 macrolitter composition in screened materials figure 3 illustrates the different waste types and categories that were collected during the campaigns the anthropogenic macrolitter composition of the screened materials is presented in figure 4 all items found at each screen are presented in the supplementary data table s1 and table s2 in this paragraph percentages will only refer to percentages in numbers and not in mass only anthropogenic waste was included in figure 3 and figure 4 natural organic debris plant debris and putrescible waste was not categorised in detail and only weighed c f 2 for s6cm and s1cm the plastic category was the most numerous with mean values of 71 9 and 62 10 n 11 with triplicates mean value standard deviation respectively excluding the first four campaigns for s6cm medical and sanitary waste had the second largest percentage 16 9 and consisted mainly of bandages for s1cm cigarette butts had the second largest percentage 24 13 other material types paper cardboard metal etc accounted for the smallest percentage 7 for s6cm and s1cm both triplicates showed a relatively low variability for the plastic category variation between the minimum and maximum values was 8 and 34 for s6cm and s1cm respectively to characterise the plastic pollution in the stormwater the most common items found in s6cm and s1cm figure 5 were identified plastic bags and films cigarette butts and bandages were the most numerous items found in the screened materials samples figure 5 plastic bags and films were the predominant items found in s6cm and s1cm of all the other items the most common items found in s6cm and s1cm are similar however they do not account for the same proportions 3 2 macrolitter mass percentages in screened materials and concentrations in urban runoff percentages by dry weight dw of each waste category for each screen are presented in figure 6 the highest average percentages for s6cm and s1cm corresponded to natural organic debris 76 13 and 94 3 dw respectively plastics 12 6 and 3 2 dw respectively and sanitary and medical waste 8 5 and 2 1 dw respectively with n 11 with triplicates and the first four campaigns were not included in the mean values other anthropogenic waste 2 5 and 1 dw for s6cm and s1cm respectively and metals 2 2 and 1 dw respectively accounted for minor percentages except for one sample march 2019 3 for triplicates 1 and 2 at s6cm plastic mass percentage ranges were 7 20 and 14 20 dw respectively whereas for triplicates 1 and 2 at s1cm the ranges were 3 5 and 3 7 dw respectively when all the anthropogenic waste was compared for triplicates 1 and 2 at s6cm plastics metals sanitary and medical waste and other anthropogenic waste the mass percentage ranges were 34 43 and 23 35 dw respectively and for triplicates 1 and 2 at s1cm these ranges were 6 7 and 6 11 dw 3 3 plastic debris flux the macrolitter concentration of stormwater mg m3 figure 7 was calculated based on the collected data the concentrations of all the anthropogenic waste ranged from 28 to 182 mg m3 and the mean and median concentrations of each waste category are presented in table 1 mean values are always higher than median values owing to heavy items that impact the mean values the natural organic debris concentrations are not presented in figure 7 because their concentrations are significantly higher than the other waste categories the plastic debris concentrations ranged between 7 and 134 mg m3 minimum and maximum values respectively utilizing the methodconcentration the mean and median mass of the plastic debris accumulated on the screens in one year were 27 22 and 21 kg respectively for the methodannual mass major fractions found in the screened materials and the percentage by weight w of plastics accumulated on both screens estimated from mass percentages previously presented are summarised in table 2 based on this data 107 55 kg of plastic debris were accumulated in the screened materials of sucy en brie in one year the results of these two methods can be normalised to the impervious surface area 62 ha and population 5 700 inhabitants of sucy en brie to calculate ratioarea and ratiocap respectively which are provided in table 3 4 discussion 4 1 macrolitter composition in screened materials because they are in series differences in the waste composition of the s6cm and s1cm screened materials can be observed figure 3 and figure 5 which is attributed to the mesh size difference the most important difference in waste composition is the abundance of cigarette butts in the s1cm material generally cigarette butts pass through s6cm but not through s1cm the s1cm mesh size is not small enough to retain all the cigarette butts in the stormwater as evidenced by the presence of cigarette butts in the lamellar settling tank personal observation however the fraction that is not retained is difficult to estimate based on their distinctive shape some plastic films were determined to be discarded cigarette box packaging this study found 52 and 60 different item categories and 1 613 and 3 126 items for s6cm table s1 and s1cm table s2 respectively plastic debris represented 71 and 62 of the s6cm and s1cm items respectively which reflects the relatively low diversity of the composition of the screened materials and the predominance of plastic waste plastic bags and films were the most common items found in the screened materials bandages were also common which could be related to the proximity of health facilities to the catchment mismanagement of health and sanitary waste and illicit disposal this is because this type of waste requires costly disposal procedures because condoms and sanitary napkins were observed in the waste misconnections between the stormwater and wastewater systems most likely exist in this catchment these misconnections are easily identified in separate sewer systems ellis and butler 2015 the most recent estimate is that 10 of all connections are misconnections between stormwater and wastewater sewers data provided by the dsea which explains the presence of these types of unexpected waste considering the relatively low variability between waste categories and the eight most common items found the waste composition must be linked to several parameters such as i the habits of the citizens ii the layout of the sewer network e g illicit connections layout of gully pots and iii the cleaning service of sucy en brie e g garbage bin availability urban cleaning the distribution of the screened materials may reflect the type of items that are socially acceptable to discard in the street easily lost or difficult to clean except for waste caused by errors linked to misconnections e g tampon applicators illicit disposal to avoid disposal costs e g bandages and animal behaviour e g birds that could potentially spread macrolitter however additional studies on these topics are necessary to confirm these trends 4 2 macrolitter and plastic debris mass percentages in screened materials and concentrations in urban runoff when the s6cm and s1cm waste from the same campaigns are combined the mass of the screened materials is primarily composed of water 70 w and natural organic debris 22 w table 2 non plastic anthropogenic waste and plastic debris account for 4 2 and 2 1 w respectively the plastic debris percentage in the screened materials was low as compared to that of natural organic debris however the mass of the plastic debris corresponds to a mean percentage of 53 16 w of all the anthropogenic waste mass showing the abundance of plastic debris although some waste categories are abundant in number i e cigarette butts they represent minor mass fractions figure 4 and 6 the natural organic debris concentrations showed the highest variability with a standard deviation of 1 145 mg m3 and a high variation between the minimum 176 mg m3 in march and maximum values 4 975 mg m3 in october figure 7 and table 1 this is assumed to be caused by seasonal variability most likely leaves dropping in autumn that are subsequently transported by the increased precipitation amounts in autumn figure 2 higher anthropogenic waste concentrations particularly plastic debris concentrations were observed during the summer period from july to august figure 7 compared to natural organic debris non plastic anthropogenic waste and plastic debris presented a different seasonal pattern initially it appears that the plastic debris concentrations correspond to smaller stormwater volumes however when plotted against stormwater volume plastic debris concentration decreases when stormwater volume increases figure s3 however no obvious correlation was found r2 0 21 and p value 0 08 utilizing the spearman rs test figure s3 which indicates that other parameters influence plastic debris accumulation in the screened materials precipitation fluctuations may have a significant influence on plastic debris accumulation in july and august 2018 only 4 and 5 rain events were recorded respectively versus 12 20 per month in the winter the summer and winter periods were compared using the mean stormwater flow rates at the outlet of the catchment for each rain event table s4 the july august rain events presented significantly higher mean flow rates compared to those in the winter period p 0 01 with a mann whitney wilcoxon test n 9 for the july august period and n 44 for the winter period the summer period is characterised by infrequent intense storm events high intensity rain events may carry more waste than less intense rain events however the holidays that occur in july and august may cause greater waste discharge due to recreational activities both parameters storm events and holidays may explain the higher values observed in the july august period compared to the other periods 4 3 plastic debris flux as shown in table 3 the methodannual mass yields higher mass accumulation values than the method concentration based on the standard deviation of the method s annual mass table 2 the mass accumulation values are more widespread than those of the method concentration which may be because the methodannual mass uses annual mean values the application of both methods enables a better assessment of the plastic accumulation in the screened materials the sucy en brie ratios can be extrapolated for the greater paris area which is defined as a catchment encompassing paris and 284 neighbouring cities spanning 183 000 ha and with a population of approximately 8 9 million risch et al 2018 sucy en brie s ratioarea and ratiocap were multiplied by the impervious area of greater paris 50 900 ha estimated by risch et al 2018 and the greater paris population table 4 these values correspond to a maximum plastic litter discharge in the stormwater assuming the habits of the sucy en brie citizens the urban cleaning methods and the layout of the sewer network are representative of the greater paris area moreover these values consider all stormwater without distinction of sewer systems combined or separate only a part of this stormwater remains untreated to ensure a better comparison between sucy en brie and greater paris we estimated the untreated stormwater from separate sewer systems for this reason ratioarea was multiplied by the impervious surface area drained by separate sewer systems 19 000 ha table 4 using the methodconcentration and methodannual mass and extrapolating the sucy en brie ratios to the greater paris area a resultant annual flux of 22 167 metric tons yr 1 of plastic debris was calculated assuming stormwater of separate sewer systems remains mainly untreated the plastic debris flux from greater paris to the environment through untreated stormwater of separate sewer systems ranges between 8 33 tons yr 1 the initial study by tramoy et al 2019 estimated that the amount of plastic debris discharged from the seine river to the english channel ranges between 1 100 and 5 600 tons yr 1 which correspond to 66 and 353 g cap 1 yr 1 respectively more recently tramoy et al 2021 in revision refined their estimations to 6 12 g yr 1 cap 1 which approximately corresponds to the results of this study and calculated a plastic debris discharge of approximately 100 200 tons yr 1 into the sea other sources may contribute to the plastic debris discharged into the seine river catchment including combined sewer overflows additionally the plastic discharges attributed to urban traffic may be underestimated plastic accumulation along the seine river has been studied tramoy et al 2019a however the precise estimation of plastic debris accumulation is difficult gasperi et al 2014 estimated that 27 metric tons of plastic are captured annually by floating booms placed downstream of the combined sewer overflows however only a portion of the floating debris is captured during storm events other factors may influence the plastic debris input into the stormwater particularly meteorological and hydrological conditions as determined by van emmerik et al 2019 who observed an increase in plastic discharge up to a factor of ten for the seine river due to meteorological and hydrological conditions althoff et al 2020 estimated the plastic consumption of france to be 70 kg per inhabitant per year the discarded plastic found in stormwater corresponds to less than 0 3 4 8 18 8 g yr 1 cap 1 table 3 of the amount consumed per inhabitant thus plastic debris fluxes in stormwater are minimal compared to plastic consumption however plastic debris inputs in the sucy en brie catchment may be higher than what accumulated in the catchment outflow for several reasons first municipal street sweeping and sanitation services in sucy en brie may be effective in preventing most plastic debris from entering in the stormwater second stormwater grates may have prevented the largest size waste from entering the sewers third plastic waste may be retained in sewer systems due to installed structures and obstacles in the sewers additionally the representativity of the sucy en brie catchment may be discussed because of its size and limited industrial and commercial activities therefore other sites should be studied for comparison this study however provides an initial estimation of the plastic debris in the stormwater of the greater paris area in addition to plastic debris larger than 5 mm microplastics in stormwater should also be studied to compare the different inputs of macro and microplastics the results of this study suggest that in urban areas plastic pollution prevention techniques combining waste collection services and systems e g sanitation services and waste screens to prevent waste from entering the environment may be effective when performed soon enough additionally plastic waste retention times in the urban areas of developed countries particularly in sewer systems and on land might be greater than what is estimated by the models lebreton et al 2017 schmidt et al 2017 additional studies should be performed to compare different urban catchments and confirm these trends 5 conclusion this study provides the first evaluation of the abundance and composition of macrolitter and plastic debris in stormwater particularly in screened materials screened materials in sucy en brie are primarily composed of water 74 w natural organic debris 22 w and anthropogenic waste 4 w among the anthropogenic waste plastic was the largest in number 60 and mass 50 of anthropogenic waste dry mass on average the plastic debris concentration in stormwater ranges from 7 to 134 mg m3 when extrapolated to the greater paris area discharged plastic debris in stormwater ranged from 22 to 167 tons yr 1 of which an estimated 8 33 tons yr 1 is discharged into the environment through untreated stormwater from separate sewer systems these estimations correspond with the recent plastic debris estimations for the seine river additional studies should be performed on the plastic debris flux variability in stormwater in other urban catchments which could help in more effectively estimating the plastic discharged into the environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

ranges were 3 5 and 3 7 dw respectively when all the anthropogenic waste was compared for triplicates 1 and 2 at s6cm plastics metals sanitary and medical waste and other anthropogenic waste the mass percentage ranges were 34 43 and 23 35 dw respectively and for triplicates 1 and 2 at s1cm these ranges were 6 7 and 6 11 dw 3 3 plastic debris flux the macrolitter concentration of stormwater mg m3 figure 7 was calculated based on the collected data the concentrations of all the anthropogenic waste ranged from 28 to 182 mg m3 and the mean and median concentrations of each waste category are presented in table 1 mean values are always higher than median values owing to heavy items that impact the mean values the natural organic debris concentrations are not presented in figure 7 because their concentrations are significantly higher than the other waste categories the plastic debris concentrations ranged between 7 and 134 mg m3 minimum and maximum values respectively utilizing the methodconcentration the mean and median mass of the plastic debris accumulated on the screens in one year were 27 22 and 21 kg respectively for the methodannual mass major fractions found in the screened materials and the percentage by weight w of plastics accumulated on both screens estimated from mass percentages previously presented are summarised in table 2 based on this data 107 55 kg of plastic debris were accumulated in the screened materials of sucy en brie in one year the results of these two methods can be normalised to the impervious surface area 62 ha and population 5 700 inhabitants of sucy en brie to calculate ratioarea and ratiocap respectively which are provided in table 3 4 discussion 4 1 macrolitter composition in screened materials because they are in series differences in the waste composition of the s6cm and s1cm screened materials can be observed figure 3 and figure 5 which is attributed to the mesh size difference the most important difference in waste composition is the abundance of cigarette butts in the s1cm material generally cigarette butts pass through s6cm but not through s1cm the s1cm mesh size is not small enough to retain all the cigarette butts in the stormwater as evidenced by the presence of cigarette butts in the lamellar settling tank personal observation however the fraction that is not retained is difficult to estimate based on their distinctive shape some plastic films were determined to be discarded cigarette box packaging this study found 52 and 60 different item categories and 1 613 and 3 126 items for s6cm table s1 and s1cm table s2 respectively plastic debris represented 71 and 62 of the s6cm and s1cm items respectively which reflects the relatively low diversity of the composition of the screened materials and the predominance of plastic waste plastic bags and films were the most common items found in the screened materials bandages were also common which could be related to the proximity of health facilities to the catchment mismanagement of health and sanitary waste and illicit disposal this is because this type of waste requires costly disposal procedures because condoms and sanitary napkins were observed in the waste misconnections between the stormwater and wastewater systems most likely exist in this catchment these misconnections are easily identified in separate sewer systems ellis and butler 2015 the most recent estimate is that 10 of all connections are misconnections between stormwater and wastewater sewers data provided by the dsea which explains the presence of these types of unexpected waste considering the relatively low variability between waste categories and the eight most common items found the waste composition must be linked to several parameters such as i the habits of the citizens ii the layout of the sewer network e g illicit connections layout of gully pots and iii the cleaning service of sucy en brie e g garbage bin availability urban cleaning the distribution of the screened materials may reflect the type of items that are socially acceptable to discard in the street easily lost or difficult to clean except for waste caused by errors linked to misconnections e g tampon applicators illicit disposal to avoid disposal costs e g bandages and animal behaviour e g birds that could potentially spread macrolitter however additional studies on these topics are necessary to confirm these trends 4 2 macrolitter and plastic debris mass percentages in screened materials and concentrations in urban runoff when the s6cm and s1cm waste from the same campaigns are combined the mass of the screened materials is primarily composed of water 70 w and natural organic debris 22 w table 2 non plastic anthropogenic waste and plastic debris account for 4 2 and 2 1 w respectively the plastic debris percentage in the screened materials was low as compared to that of natural organic debris however the mass of the plastic debris corresponds to a mean percentage of 53 16 w of all the anthropogenic waste mass showing the abundance of plastic debris although some waste categories are abundant in number i e cigarette butts they represent minor mass fractions figure 4 and 6 the natural organic debris concentrations showed the highest variability with a standard deviation of 1 145 mg m3 and a high variation between the minimum 176 mg m3 in march and maximum values 4 975 mg m3 in october figure 7 and table 1 this is assumed to be caused by seasonal variability most likely leaves dropping in autumn that are subsequently transported by the increased precipitation amounts in autumn figure 2 higher anthropogenic waste concentrations particularly plastic debris concentrations were observed during the summer period from july to august figure 7 compared to natural organic debris non plastic anthropogenic waste and plastic debris presented a different seasonal pattern initially it appears that the plastic debris concentrations correspond to smaller stormwater volumes however when plotted against stormwater volume plastic debris concentration decreases when stormwater volume increases figure s3 however no obvious correlation was found r2 0 21 and p value 0 08 utilizing the spearman rs test figure s3 which indicates that other parameters influence plastic debris accumulation in the screened materials precipitation fluctuations may have a significant influence on plastic debris accumulation in july and august 2018 only 4 and 5 rain events were recorded respectively versus 12 20 per month in the winter the summer and winter periods were compared using the mean stormwater flow rates at the outlet of the catchment for each rain event table s4 the july august rain events presented significantly higher mean flow rates compared to those in the winter period p 0 01 with a mann whitney wilcoxon test n 9 for the july august period and n 44 for the winter period the summer period is characterised by infrequent intense storm events high intensity rain events may carry more waste than less intense rain events however the holidays that occur in july and august may cause greater waste discharge due to recreational activities both parameters storm events and holidays may explain the higher values observed in the july august period compared to the other periods 4 3 plastic debris flux as shown in table 3 the methodannual mass yields higher mass accumulation values than the method concentration based on the standard deviation of the method s annual mass table 2 the mass accumulation values are more widespread than those of the method concentration which may be because the methodannual mass uses annual mean values the application of both methods enables a better assessment of the plastic accumulation in the screened materials the sucy en brie ratios can be extrapolated for the greater paris area which is defined as a catchment encompassing paris and 284 neighbouring cities spanning 183 000 ha and with a population of approximately 8 9 million risch et al 2018 sucy en brie s ratioarea and ratiocap were multiplied by the impervious area of greater paris 50 900 ha estimated by risch et al 2018 and the greater paris population table 4 these values correspond to a maximum plastic litter discharge in the stormwater assuming the habits of the sucy en brie citizens the urban cleaning methods and the layout of the sewer network are representative of the greater paris area moreover these values consider all stormwater without distinction of sewer systems combined or separate only a part of this stormwater remains untreated to ensure a better comparison between sucy en brie and greater paris we estimated the untreated stormwater from separate sewer systems for this reason ratioarea was multiplied by the impervious surface area drained by separate sewer systems 19 000 ha table 4 using the methodconcentration and methodannual mass and extrapolating the sucy en brie ratios to the greater paris area a resultant annual flux of 22 167 metric tons yr 1 of plastic debris was calculated assuming stormwater of separate sewer systems remains mainly untreated the plastic debris flux from greater paris to the environment through untreated stormwater of separate sewer systems ranges between 8 33 tons yr 1 the initial study by tramoy et al 2019 estimated that the amount of plastic debris discharged from the seine river to the english channel ranges between 1 100 and 5 600 tons yr 1 which correspond to 66 and 353 g cap 1 yr 1 respectively more recently tramoy et al 2021 in revision refined their estimations to 6 12 g yr 1 cap 1 which approximately corresponds to the results of this study and calculated a plastic debris discharge of approximately 100 200 tons yr 1 into the sea other sources may contribute to the plastic debris discharged into the seine river catchment including combined sewer overflows additionally the plastic discharges attributed to urban traffic may be underestimated plastic accumulation along the seine river has been studied tramoy et al 2019a however the precise estimation of plastic debris accumulation is difficult gasperi et al 2014 estimated that 27 metric tons of plastic are captured annually by floating booms placed downstream of the combined sewer overflows however only a portion of the floating debris is captured during storm events other factors may influence the plastic debris input into the stormwater particularly meteorological and hydrological conditions as determined by van emmerik et al 2019 who observed an increase in plastic discharge up to a factor of ten for the seine river due to meteorological and hydrological conditions althoff et al 2020 estimated the plastic consumption of france to be 70 kg per inhabitant per year the discarded plastic found in stormwater corresponds to less than 0 3 4 8 18 8 g yr 1 cap 1 table 3 of the amount consumed per inhabitant thus plastic debris fluxes in stormwater are minimal compared to plastic consumption however plastic debris inputs in the sucy en brie catchment may be higher than what accumulated in the catchment outflow for several reasons first municipal street sweeping and sanitation services in sucy en brie may be effective in preventing most plastic debris from entering in the stormwater second stormwater grates may have prevented the largest size waste from entering the sewers third plastic waste may be retained in sewer systems due to installed structures and obstacles in the sewers additionally the representativity of the sucy en brie catchment may be discussed because of its size and limited industrial and commercial activities therefore other sites should be studied for comparison this study however provides an initial estimation of the plastic debris in the stormwater of the greater paris area in addition to plastic debris larger than 5 mm microplastics in stormwater should also be studied to compare the different inputs of macro and microplastics the results of this study suggest that in urban areas plastic pollution prevention techniques combining waste collection services and systems e g sanitation services and waste screens to prevent waste from entering the environment may be effective when performed soon enough additionally plastic waste retention times in the urban areas of developed countries particularly in sewer systems and on land might be greater than what is estimated by the models lebreton et al 2017 schmidt et al 2017 additional studies should be performed to compare different urban catchments and confirm these trends 5 conclusion this study provides the first evaluation of the abundance and composition of macrolitter and plastic debris in stormwater particularly in screened materials screened materials in sucy en brie are primarily composed of water 74 w natural organic debris 22 w and anthropogenic waste 4 w among the anthropogenic waste plastic was the largest in number 60 and mass 50 of anthropogenic waste dry mass on average the plastic debris concentration in stormwater ranges from 7 to 134 mg m3 when extrapolated to the greater paris area discharged plastic debris in stormwater ranged from 22 to 167 tons yr 1 of which an estimated 8 33 tons yr 1 is discharged into the environment through untreated stormwater from separate sewer systems these estimations correspond with the recent plastic debris estimations for the seine river additional studies should be performed on the plastic debris flux variability in stormwater in other urban catchments which could help in more effectively estimating the plastic discharged into the environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

often use manufactured plastics of known polymers weathered experimentally instead of observational study designs which reflect more closely the real world conditions of microplastic pollution field data are needed to assess potential health risks and include lotic ecosystems in the global budgets of plastic the aim of this study was to determine microplastic concentrations their polymer types and associated microbial communities including selected virulence and amr genes in the river rhine an important contributor to microplastic pollution in the north sea mani et al 2015 the microplastic and microbial community compositions of paired contemporaneous samples were thus tested for possible associations in order to determine whether microbial diversity and taxon abundances differed significantly as a function of the respective plastic polymer concentrations moreover seasonal and geographical differences in both microplastic and microbiota profiles were investigated materials and methods 2 1 sampling two sampling sites in the dutch portion of the rhine were selected lobith rhine s entry into the netherlands and vianen close to a drinking water abstraction point where the lekkanaal provides a separate portion of the rhine unmixed with other water bodies before reaching the north sea fig 1 at each site four samplings were performed two in july 2019 summer and two in january 2020 winter both sites were sampled contemporaneously at each sampling 450 750 litres of surface water was filtered through a cascade of two metal sieves gilson usa of respectively 500 and 100 μm with a 10 μm plankton net hydro bios germany at the end for each fraction residue paired samples were generated for respectively plastic particle and microbiological analyses the surface water before filtration and the filtrate were also analysed microbiologically each fraction residue was transferred into a glass bottle using milli q ultrapure water milliporesigma usa and stored at 4 c water temperature ph and turbidity when measured were similar within the same season table s1 2 2 microplastic analyses plastic particle analyses were based on already described methods mintenig et al 2020 löder et al 2015 mintenig et al 2018 leslie et al 2017 and focused on 10 and 100 μm residues particle numbers larger than 500 μm and those of 10 20 μm were estimated using fitted trend lines kooi and koelmans 2019 the combined residue suspensions were filtrated over a 10 µm metal mesh and the filter was transferred into a beaker with 10 sodium dodecylsulfonate after a day the suspension was filtrated again and the filter was transferred into a beaker with 75 ml 12 5 potassium hydroxide for 5 days at 35 c subsequently the suspension was re filtrated transferred into a beaker with 50 ml 30 hydrogen peroxide for one day at 35 c and filtrated again the residues were then transferred into a separation funnel using 100 ml zinc chloride 1 6 g cm3 the funnels were shaken and left still to enable settling of denser materials the settled material was discarded by continuously turning the valve of the funnel to prevent clogging re suspension and particle loss about 10 ml of liquid was allowed to remain in the funnel which was filtrated again over a metal filter using 4 ml ethanol the retained materials were removed from the filter and transferred into a glass vial a vortex was created in this suspension to distribute the particles evenly a subsample 20 100 µm was put on a microscope slide the sample was analysed using a laser direct infrared ldir chemical imaging system agilent germany to detect and characterise 20 500 µm particles as 20 μm is the technical limit concentrations were expressed as particles m3 water all analyses were performed in duplicate 2 3 microbiological analyses 2 3 1 filtration and dna extraction within a day after collection the samples surface water 500 100 and 10 μm residues and the filtrate were filtrated using a vacuum system sartorius germany with a 47 mm diameter cellulose nitrate filter membrane 0 45 μm pore diameter until saturation two different filtration methods termed flotation and homogenisation were applied to each sample as plastic tends to float the flotation method consisted of letting the water stand still for 15 min and then filter out only the upper part of the water volume with the vacuum system for the homogenisation method the bottles were shaken to homogenise the content which was then filtrated with the vacuum system dna extraction was done using the dneasy powerwater kit qiagen germany all analyses were performed in duplicate 2 3 2 16s rrna gene sequencing sequencing of the v4 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene was used to determine the microbial community composition in each sample the quantity of isolated dna bacterial load was determined using 16s real time pcr and the samples were diluted to the necessary concentration for sequencing the 16s rrna gene was amplified using f515 r806 primers and 30 amplification cycles the nextera xt indexes were used to give every sample a unique adaptor barcode sequence to combine the samples into a single 16s rrna gene pool for sequencing after the first and second pcr the amplicons were checked with the qiaxcel advanced system qiagen using the qiaxcel dna high resolution kit the concentration of the pool sample was quantified with the kapa library quantification kit for illumina platforms roche switzerland 10 phix dna spike in control was added to the pool to increase the library diversity 16s rrna gene amplicons were sequenced using the in house illumina miseq illumina usa platform to sequence 300 bp paired end reads 2 3 3 virulence and amr gene detection the amr genes sul1 and erm b and the virulence genes stx1 and stx2 were used as indicators of amr and virulence in the microbial communities of the collected samples these genes were selected based on their relevance for public health and the environment the genes were investigated using qpcr as described elsewhere franz et al 2015 the pcr mix for the sul1 and erm b genes included the iq sybr green supermix 1x bio rad the netherlands with 400 nm primer concentration and 2 μl dna sample the pcr mix was optimised in 20 μl total volume the taq polymerase activation was obtained at 95 c for three minutes amplification with 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 c and at 60 c for 30 s after the amplification the melting curve program started at 60 c with an increment of 0 5 c for five seconds until 95 c amplification and melting curves were then analysed gene concentrations were quantified using a gblock gene fragment that contained the genetic code of the sul1 and erm b genes integrated dna technologies usa eight dilutions of the standard were taken in every plate the presence of stx1 and stx2 was tested in 2 5 μl dna sample with a primer concentration of 400 and 500 nm of the fam probe respectively and 1x iq multiplex powermix bio rad the pcr mix was optimized in 25 μl total volume the taq polymerase activation was done at 95 c for 10 min amplification for 40 cycles at 95 c for 15 s and 60 c for 30 s genes were detected with cfx96 touch real time pcr detection system bio rad 2 4 data analyses 2 4 1 microplastic abundance differences in microplastic concentrations between particle sizes 20 100 or 100 500 μm seasons summer or winter and sampling locations lobith or vianen were tested for statistical significance using generalized linear models glms with a log link and negative binomial error distribution differences in relative abundances of polymer types were tested using glms with a logit link and binomial error distribution 2 4 2 bioinformatics the reads obtained from 16s rrna gene sequencing were transformed into sample wise relative abundances to remove noise only taxa present at a confident level of detection of 0 01 relative abundance over all samples were selected for analysis taxa their patterns and potential differences thereof were studied at the lowest taxonomic level resolution genus the raw sequence reads are deposited in the european nucleotide archive ena repository under accession number prjeb41771 taxonomic identification was performed with the naïve bayesian classifier in dada2 callahan et al 2016 the silva ribosomal rna database was used for taxonomic annotation quast et al 2013 quality of the reads was checked with fastqc and trimming of the adapters was done using trimmomatic bolger et al 2014 2 4 3 microbial diversity the shannon index was used to quantify α diversity of microbial communities differences in shannon index over sample types surface water 500 100 and 10 μm residues filtrate sampling sites seasons and filtration methods flotation or homogenisation were tested using glms with an identity link function and gaussian error distribution normality of residuals was checked with the shapiro wilk test 2 4 4 microbial community composition ordination of microbial community composition taxon relative abundances in relation to sample type season sampling location and filtration method as well as polymer type abundances in the respective samples were visualized with canonical correspondence analysis cca permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova based on bray curtis dissimilarity was used to test for differences in microbial communities across the aforementioned variables the simper method clarke 1993 based on bray curtis dissimilarity was used to identify taxa primarily responsible for the differences significance was tested using glms with a logit link and binomial error distribution also for the associations with polymer type abundances 2 4 5 general analytics all glms included cluster robust sandwich variance estimators to account for sample replicates in all analyses family wise bonferroni correction was applied bonferroni corrected p values 0 05 were considered statistically significant when the p value was very small i e 0 001 the p value 0 001 cut off was reported analyses were performed using stata 16 statacorp usa past 4 03 oslo university norway and r studio rstudio usa results microplastics microplastics were found in all sites and samplings both the highest and lowest microplastic concentrations were found in vianen table 1 respectively in summer 334 667 particles m3 and winter 102 708 particles m3 overall microplastic concentrations were significantly higher in summer vs winter p value 0 001 and the 20 100 μm fraction was significantly higher than the 100 500 μm one p value 0 001 the estimated 10 20 µm fraction particle number was in the order of magnitude of 800 000 particles m3 summer and 500 000 particles m3 winter in summer the particle number for the 500 µm fraction was estimated at 2500 particles m3 and at 1500 particles m3 in winter figure s1 no significant differences in microplastic concentrations were found between locations the average concentration across seasons and locations was 213 147 95 confidence interval 95 ci 76 721 349 572 particles m3 polyamide and polyvinylchloride were the most abundant polymers 30 and 26 of total respectively all but two polymer type concentrations polystyrene and polyurethane were significantly more represented amongst 20 100 than 100 500 μm particles the concentrations of polypropylene and polyvinylchloride were those significantly higher in summer vs winter no significant differences between locations were found table s2 when the polymer type concentrations were analysed as relative abundances i e as the proportions of each polymer type concentrations over the total microplastic concentration in a sample figure s2 the significant differences were as follows polypropylene was more abundant amongst 100 500 than 20 100 μm particles p value 0 009 polyvinylchloride was more abundant in summer than in winter p value 0 001 polystyrene was more abundant in lobith than in vianen p value 0 018 microbial communities the 80 samples i e 2 samples x 5 types of sample x 2 filtration methods x 2 sampling locations x 2 seasons produced 8390 415 high quality sequence reads in total and resulted in 480 taxa distributed over two kingdoms 99 9 bacteria 0 1 archaea 29 phyla mostly proteobacteria 47 bacteroidetes 17 and cyanobacteria 14 67 classes mostly betaproteobacteria 21 gammaproteobacteria 17 and chloroplast 11 102 orders mostly burkholderiales 17 pseudomonadales 10 and flavobacteriales 8 171 families mostly comamonadaceae 14 moraxellaceae 9 and sporichthyaceae 5 and 307 genera mostly acinetobacter 7 flavobacterium 5 and hgci clade 4 fig 2 shows the mean relative abundances of the top 15 taxa at genus level shannon index the shannon index was lowest amongst 500 μm samples and highest amongst 10 μm samples fig 3 α diversity amongst 500 μm samples was significantly lower than any other sample type p 0 001 α diversity did not differ significantly between the other sample types α diversity was significantly increased in winter p value 0 001 and when using the homogenisation method p value 0 001 no significant differences between sampling locations were found α diversity was not significantly associated with microplastic concentrations nor specific polymer types microbiota profiles the permanova and cca fig 4 showed that there were significant differences in microbial community over sample types overall average dissimilarity 77 56 p value 0 001 seasons dissimilarity 71 92 p value 0 001 and filtration methods dissimilarity 67 10 p value 0 004 but not between sampling sites the post hoc tests after permanova showed that the significant differences all p values 0 001 were those between surface water and 500 μm dissimilarity 84 20 and 100 μm dissimilarity 74 61 samples between the filtrates and the 500 μm dissimilarity 82 55 and 100 μm dissimilarity 74 61 samples and between the 10 μm and 500 μm dissimilarity 81 34 and 100 μm dissimilarity 69 76 samples therefore the microbial community composition of 500 and 100 μm samples resembled one another and differed significantly from that of the 10 μm samples the filtrates and the surface water which were similar to each other the microbial community also seemed to shift towards a more water like profile as the particles became smaller for subsequent analyses therefore sample types were grouped together into small particle water like samples i e surface water filtrates and 10 μm samples and into large particle samples i e 500 and 10 μm samples only 21 of the observed 480 taxa were responsible for 50 of the dissimilarities in overall microbial community composition between groups table 2 with most of these taxa being significantly enriched in specific groups of samples figs 5 and 6 the largest significant differences in relative abundance were found for acinetobacter between sample types and seasons and for flavobacterium between filtration methods fig 6 relative abundance data are given in table s3 microplastics and microbiota the associations between the differentially abundant taxa and the polymer type relative abundances were investigated in a subset of 32 paired samples of 10 and 100 μm analysed for microbial community composition that were coupled with the analysed plastic particle sizes of 20 100 and 100 500 μm respectively fig 7 polyethylene terephthalate was negatively associated with chloroplast p value 0 012 and positively associated with flavobacterium p value 0 021 and simplicispira p value 0 009 polypropylene was positively associated with acinetobacter p value 0 001 polystyrene with hydrogenophaga p value 0 001 polyethylene with pseudomonas p value 0 036 isoprene with pseudarcicella p value 0 0001 and polyurethane with synechococcus p value 0 001 polyvinylchloride particles were negatively associated with flavobacterium p value 0 011 and synechococcus p value 0 007 and particles of unknown polymers were positively associated with massilia p value 0 035 and negatively associated with hydrogenophaga p value 0 007 and acinetobacter p value 0 001 pathogens focusing on genera detected in the samples and known to harbour pathogenic species such as acinetobacter pseudomonas legionella mycobacterium and arcobacter we found large particles to be significantly enriched p value 0 001 with acinetobacter relative abundance 14 6 and pseudomonas 2 0 as compared to small particle water like samples 0 7 and 0 8 respectively whereas legionella and mycobacterium were not significantly associated with sample type for arcobacter significantly higher abundances were found in all sample types all p values 0 001 as compared to 500 μm samples virulence and amr genes the virulence genes stx1 and stx2 were not detected in any sample but the amr genes erm b and sul1 were detected in respectively 75 and 79 out of the 80 samples resulting in a prevalence of 93 8 95 ci 80 9 98 2 for erm b and 98 8 95 ci 91 2 99 8 for sul1 the 5 erm b and 1 sul1 negative samples were all 500 μm samples collected in vianen in both summer n 2 and winter n 3 discussion in this study the biofilms of large particles 100 500 μm were found to harbour significantly different microbial communities with decreased diversity as compared to surface water and smaller particles 10 100 μm or smaller this might be related to the relatively larger attachment surface of the significantly more abundant small vs large particles moreover there was a trend towards a more water like microbial community as the residue fraction size became smaller an indication that planktonic microbiota accumulated in the lowest layers of the sieve cascade we also observed more temporal than spatial heterogeneity with season influencing the microbial communities significantly taxon diversity on freshwater microplastics is often lower than the water itself or natural substrates miao et al 2019 jiang et al 2018 mccormick et al 2016 mccormick et al 2014 we also found polypropylene to be significantly more abundant amongst large particles where diversity was the lowest and it has indeed been reported that microbial diversity is particularly low on polypropylene zettler et al 2013 moreover diversity was lower in summer despite microplastic concentrations were higher in summer lower diversity during summertime has been observed in different freshwater environments and seems to be driven by changes in several physicochemical parameters besides temperature garcía armisen et al 2014 previous studies have shown distinct microbial communities between plastic and water samples zettler et al 2013 jiang et al 2018 ogonowski et al 2018 these differences are intriguing as microbial communities exist in close proximity in the river and were collected contemporaneously amongst the most interesting differences was the relatively high abundance of gammaproteobacteria especially acinetobacter pseudomonas thiothrix alkanindiges and betaproteobacteria especially roseateles massilia hydrogenophaga acidovorax on large particles and different bacteroidetes and actinobacteria taxa especially ns11 12 marine group hgci clade pseudarcicella candidatus planktophila on small particle water like samples fig 6 previous studies reported similar findings particularly gammaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria being more abundant on plastic and bacteroidetes and actinobacteria on natural substrates zettler et al 2013 miao et al 2019 mccormick et al 2016 ogonowski et al 2018 certain species belonging to gammaproteobacteria are early biofilm producers on artificial substrates and the genus pseudomonas especially is notorious to thrive on plastics mccormick et al 2016 mccormick et al 2014 exposure to pathogenic pseudomonas species may cause abrasion and ear infections schets et al 2014 and two opportunistic human pathogens pseudomonas monteilii and pseudomonas mendocina and one plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae have been reported to occur exclusively on plastic wu et al 2019 we found pseudomonas to be more abundant in samples with high polyethylene concentrations and pseudomonas is known to be able to biodegrade plastic polymers particularly polyethylene tribedi et al 2015 it is worth stressing that plastic polymer composition and microbial community composition were tested for possible associations in separate samples while such correlative study design allowed us to determine whether the microbial community composition varies depending on the abundance of the different plastic polymers it does not provide the same level of detail as analysing the microbial assemblages of individual plastic pieces of specific polymer types although this study was primarily meant to generate hypotheses rather than testing them most of the aforementioned results about microbial diversity and the different associations between plastic polymers and microbial taxa were previously observed meaning that our results were confirmatory in nature which in turn supports the validity of the analyses in general it follows therefore that our findings support the general notion that microplastics may serve as unique substrates for microbial colonisation and that taxon selection occurs during biofilm development on microplastics resulting in reduced capacity to support diversity miao et al 2019 microplastics are often seen as potential vectors of pathogenic microorganisms miao et al 2019 jiang et al 2018 mccormick et al 2016 in addition to the biofilm associated and possibly plastic degrading taxa taxa that are known to harbour potentially pathogenic species such as pseudomonas acinetobacter and arcobacter as well as the selected amr genes were found while the absence of the stx1 and stx2 genes might be explained by the lack of detectable escherichia and shigella bacteria although these genes are described in other enterobacteriaceae as well it can also be hypothesized that selection taking place in aquatic environments plays a role since these genes would give no immediate advantage for bacterial fitness in such environments conversely amr genes would confer an advantage as antimicrobial residues are present in surface water especially wastewater arias andres et al 2018 imran et al 2019 moreover co selection of multi resistance in microplastic contaminated environments is an emerging risk imran et al 2019 with microplastics acting as hotspots for emerge and spread selective enrichment of certain bacterial pathogens on microplastics has been reported mccormick et al 2016 the genera acinetobacter and pseudomonas which include several potential pathogenic species were significantly more abundant amongst large particles than surface water or small particle water like samples moreover the genus arcobacter which also includes potential pathogens were almost as abundant on the particles as in water but more abundant amongst 100 and 10 μm samples as our analyses did not allow for species identification but only for genera that may contain known pathogenic species further research is needed to confirm these findings 16s rrna gene sequencing is a powerful method to determine microbial community structures but metagenomic sequencing is likely to provide a more detailed picture including microbial species virulence and amr genes as it is particularly useful to determine the genomic potential of different environments this study has several limitations we were not able to fully differentiate plastic from seston particles in the samples unless one manually isolates relatively large plastic particles or uses a controlled weathering experiment in which specific plastic particles of known polymer and concentration are exposed to a given aquatic environment it is hard to isolate and characterize plastic particles from surface water in a way that does not alter or damage their biofilms our method although imperfect allowed us to analyse directly the samples both chemically and microbiologically in parallel furthermore although the samples were not made of 100 plastic the microbial community results were highly comparable with those from studies using exclusively plastic particles in controlled experiments miao et al 2019 this indicated that the sampling did capture plastic particles and that non plastic particles had a limited impact and even if the results were not specific for plastic they were likely to be driven by the plastic differences in microbial communities between filtration methods were also observed with the flotation method the fraction of plastic particles that was captured included the floating plastic particles so the results represented mainly the microbiota associated with enhanced microplastic buoyancy and low density particles conversely the homogenisation method comprised the sediment with plastic having density exceeding that of water but also non plastic residues both filtration methods were thus complementary to one another in providing data for the whole microbial community in a sample conclusions microplastics were widespread in the analysed samples with concentrations polymer types and microbial communities varying mainly by season and particle size and less by location results were compatible with the existence of taxon selecting mechanisms and reduced microbial diversity in the biofilms of plastic substrates a number of biofilm associated and plastic degrading taxa were enriched in certain types of samples and occurred more abundantly in association with specific plastic polymers including taxa that may harbour human entero pathogens as well as ubiquitous amr genes this information helps understanding microplastic pollution in

often use manufactured plastics of known polymers weathered experimentally instead of observational study designs which reflect more closely the real world conditions of microplastic pollution field data are needed to assess potential health risks and include lotic ecosystems in the global budgets of plastic the aim of this study was to determine microplastic concentrations their polymer types and associated microbial communities including selected virulence and amr genes in the river rhine an important contributor to microplastic pollution in the north sea mani et al 2015 the microplastic and microbial community compositions of paired contemporaneous samples were thus tested for possible associations in order to determine whether microbial diversity and taxon abundances differed significantly as a function of the respective plastic polymer concentrations moreover seasonal and geographical differences in both microplastic and microbiota profiles were investigated materials and methods 2 1 sampling two sampling sites in the dutch portion of the rhine were selected lobith rhine s entry into the netherlands and vianen close to a drinking water abstraction point where the lekkanaal provides a separate portion of the rhine unmixed with other water bodies before reaching the north sea fig 1 at each site four samplings were performed two in july 2019 summer and two in january 2020 winter both sites were sampled contemporaneously at each sampling 450 750 litres of surface water was filtered through a cascade of two metal sieves gilson usa of respectively 500 and 100 μm with a 10 μm plankton net hydro bios germany at the end for each fraction residue paired samples were generated for respectively plastic particle and microbiological analyses the surface water before filtration and the filtrate were also analysed microbiologically each fraction residue was transferred into a glass bottle using milli q ultrapure water milliporesigma usa and stored at 4 c water temperature ph and turbidity when measured were similar within the same season table s1 2 2 microplastic analyses plastic particle analyses were based on already described methods mintenig et al 2020 löder et al 2015 mintenig et al 2018 leslie et al 2017 and focused on 10 and 100 μm residues particle numbers larger than 500 μm and those of 10 20 μm were estimated using fitted trend lines kooi and koelmans 2019 the combined residue suspensions were filtrated over a 10 µm metal mesh and the filter was transferred into a beaker with 10 sodium dodecylsulfonate after a day the suspension was filtrated again and the filter was transferred into a beaker with 75 ml 12 5 potassium hydroxide for 5 days at 35 c subsequently the suspension was re filtrated transferred into a beaker with 50 ml 30 hydrogen peroxide for one day at 35 c and filtrated again the residues were then transferred into a separation funnel using 100 ml zinc chloride 1 6 g cm3 the funnels were shaken and left still to enable settling of denser materials the settled material was discarded by continuously turning the valve of the funnel to prevent clogging re suspension and particle loss about 10 ml of liquid was allowed to remain in the funnel which was filtrated again over a metal filter using 4 ml ethanol the retained materials were removed from the filter and transferred into a glass vial a vortex was created in this suspension to distribute the particles evenly a subsample 20 100 µm was put on a microscope slide the sample was analysed using a laser direct infrared ldir chemical imaging system agilent germany to detect and characterise 20 500 µm particles as 20 μm is the technical limit concentrations were expressed as particles m3 water all analyses were performed in duplicate 2 3 microbiological analyses 2 3 1 filtration and dna extraction within a day after collection the samples surface water 500 100 and 10 μm residues and the filtrate were filtrated using a vacuum system sartorius germany with a 47 mm diameter cellulose nitrate filter membrane 0 45 μm pore diameter until saturation two different filtration methods termed flotation and homogenisation were applied to each sample as plastic tends to float the flotation method consisted of letting the water stand still for 15 min and then filter out only the upper part of the water volume with the vacuum system for the homogenisation method the bottles were shaken to homogenise the content which was then filtrated with the vacuum system dna extraction was done using the dneasy powerwater kit qiagen germany all analyses were performed in duplicate 2 3 2 16s rrna gene sequencing sequencing of the v4 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene was used to determine the microbial community composition in each sample the quantity of isolated dna bacterial load was determined using 16s real time pcr and the samples were diluted to the necessary concentration for sequencing the 16s rrna gene was amplified using f515 r806 primers and 30 amplification cycles the nextera xt indexes were used to give every sample a unique adaptor barcode sequence to combine the samples into a single 16s rrna gene pool for sequencing after the first and second pcr the amplicons were checked with the qiaxcel advanced system qiagen using the qiaxcel dna high resolution kit the concentration of the pool sample was quantified with the kapa library quantification kit for illumina platforms roche switzerland 10 phix dna spike in control was added to the pool to increase the library diversity 16s rrna gene amplicons were sequenced using the in house illumina miseq illumina usa platform to sequence 300 bp paired end reads 2 3 3 virulence and amr gene detection the amr genes sul1 and erm b and the virulence genes stx1 and stx2 were used as indicators of amr and virulence in the microbial communities of the collected samples these genes were selected based on their relevance for public health and the environment the genes were investigated using qpcr as described elsewhere franz et al 2015 the pcr mix for the sul1 and erm b genes included the iq sybr green supermix 1x bio rad the netherlands with 400 nm primer concentration and 2 μl dna sample the pcr mix was optimised in 20 μl total volume the taq polymerase activation was obtained at 95 c for three minutes amplification with 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 c and at 60 c for 30 s after the amplification the melting curve program started at 60 c with an increment of 0 5 c for five seconds until 95 c amplification and melting curves were then analysed gene concentrations were quantified using a gblock gene fragment that contained the genetic code of the sul1 and erm b genes integrated dna technologies usa eight dilutions of the standard were taken in every plate the presence of stx1 and stx2 was tested in 2 5 μl dna sample with a primer concentration of 400 and 500 nm of the fam probe respectively and 1x iq multiplex powermix bio rad the pcr mix was optimized in 25 μl total volume the taq polymerase activation was done at 95 c for 10 min amplification for 40 cycles at 95 c for 15 s and 60 c for 30 s genes were

seasons summer or winter and sampling locations lobith or vianen were tested for statistical significance using generalized linear models glms with a log link and negative binomial error distribution differences in relative abundances of polymer types were tested using glms with a logit link and binomial error distribution 2 4 2 bioinformatics the reads obtained from 16s rrna gene sequencing were transformed into sample wise relative abundances to remove noise only taxa present at a confident level of detection of 0 01 relative abundance over all samples were selected for analysis taxa their patterns and potential differences thereof were studied at the lowest taxonomic level resolution genus the raw sequence reads are deposited in the european nucleotide archive ena repository under accession number prjeb41771 taxonomic identification was performed with the naïve bayesian classifier in dada2 callahan et al 2016 the silva ribosomal rna database was used for taxonomic annotation quast et al 2013 quality of the reads was checked with fastqc and trimming of the adapters was done using trimmomatic bolger et al 2014 2 4 3 microbial diversity the shannon index was used to quantify α diversity of microbial communities differences in shannon index over sample types surface water 500 100 and 10 μm residues filtrate sampling sites seasons and filtration methods flotation or homogenisation were tested using glms with an identity link function and gaussian error distribution normality of residuals was checked with the shapiro wilk test 2 4 4 microbial community composition ordination of microbial community composition taxon relative abundances in relation to sample type season sampling location and filtration method as well as polymer type abundances in the respective samples were visualized with canonical correspondence analysis cca permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova based on bray curtis dissimilarity was used to test for differences in microbial communities across the aforementioned variables the simper method clarke 1993 based on bray curtis dissimilarity was used to identify taxa primarily responsible for the differences significance was tested using glms with a logit link and binomial error distribution also for the associations with polymer type abundances 2 4 5 general analytics all glms included cluster robust sandwich variance estimators to account for sample replicates in all analyses family wise bonferroni correction was applied bonferroni corrected p values 0 05 were considered statistically significant when the p value was very small i e 0 001 the p value 0 001 cut off was reported analyses were performed using stata 16 statacorp usa past 4 03 oslo university norway and r studio rstudio usa results microplastics microplastics were found in all sites and samplings both the highest and lowest microplastic concentrations were found in vianen table 1 respectively in summer 334 667 particles m3 and winter 102 708 particles m3 overall microplastic concentrations were significantly higher in summer vs winter p value 0 001 and the 20 100 μm fraction was significantly higher than the 100 500 μm one p value 0 001 the estimated 10 20 µm fraction particle number was in the order of magnitude of 800 000 particles m3 summer and 500 000 particles m3 winter in summer the particle number for the 500 µm fraction was estimated at 2500 particles m3 and at 1500 particles m3 in winter figure s1 no significant differences in microplastic concentrations were found between locations the average concentration across seasons and locations was 213 147 95 confidence interval 95 ci 76 721 349 572 particles m3 polyamide and polyvinylchloride were the most abundant polymers 30 and 26 of total respectively all but two polymer type concentrations polystyrene and polyurethane were significantly more represented amongst 20 100 than 100 500 μm particles the concentrations of polypropylene and polyvinylchloride were those significantly higher in summer vs winter no significant differences between locations were found table s2 when the polymer type concentrations were analysed as relative abundances i e as the proportions of each polymer type concentrations over the total microplastic concentration in a sample figure s2 the significant differences were as follows polypropylene was more abundant amongst 100 500 than 20 100 μm particles p value 0 009 polyvinylchloride was more abundant in summer than in winter p value 0 001 polystyrene was more abundant in lobith than in vianen p value 0 018 microbial communities the 80 samples i e 2 samples x 5 types of sample x 2 filtration methods x 2 sampling locations x 2 seasons produced 8390 415 high quality sequence reads in total and resulted in 480 taxa distributed over two kingdoms 99 9 bacteria 0 1 archaea 29 phyla mostly proteobacteria 47 bacteroidetes 17 and cyanobacteria 14 67 classes mostly betaproteobacteria 21 gammaproteobacteria 17 and chloroplast 11 102 orders mostly burkholderiales 17 pseudomonadales 10 and flavobacteriales 8 171 families mostly comamonadaceae 14 moraxellaceae 9 and sporichthyaceae 5 and 307 genera mostly acinetobacter 7 flavobacterium 5 and hgci clade 4 fig 2 shows the mean relative abundances of the top 15 taxa at genus level shannon index the shannon index was lowest amongst 500 μm samples and highest amongst 10 μm samples fig 3 α diversity amongst 500 μm samples was significantly lower than any other sample type p 0 001 α diversity did not differ significantly between the other sample types α diversity was significantly increased in winter p value 0 001 and when using the homogenisation method p value 0 001 no significant differences between sampling locations were found α diversity was not significantly associated with microplastic concentrations nor specific polymer types microbiota profiles the permanova and cca fig 4 showed that there were significant differences in microbial community over sample types overall average dissimilarity 77 56 p value 0 001 seasons dissimilarity 71 92 p value 0 001 and filtration methods dissimilarity 67 10 p value 0 004 but not between sampling sites the post hoc tests after permanova showed that the significant differences all p values 0 001 were those between surface water and 500 μm dissimilarity 84 20 and 100 μm dissimilarity 74 61 samples between the filtrates and the 500 μm dissimilarity 82 55 and 100 μm dissimilarity 74 61 samples and between the 10 μm and 500 μm dissimilarity 81 34 and 100 μm dissimilarity 69 76 samples therefore the microbial community composition of 500 and 100 μm samples resembled one another and differed significantly from that of the 10 μm samples the filtrates and the surface water which were similar to each other the microbial community also seemed to shift towards a more water like profile as the particles became smaller for subsequent analyses therefore sample types were grouped together into small particle water like samples i e surface water filtrates and 10 μm samples and into large particle samples i e 500 and 10 μm samples only 21 of the observed 480 taxa were responsible for 50 of the dissimilarities in overall microbial community composition between groups table 2 with most of these taxa being significantly enriched in specific groups of samples figs 5 and 6 the largest significant differences in relative abundance were found for acinetobacter between sample types and seasons and for flavobacterium between filtration methods fig 6 relative abundance data are given in table s3 microplastics and microbiota the associations between the differentially abundant taxa and the polymer type relative abundances were investigated in a subset of 32 paired samples of 10 and 100 μm analysed for microbial community composition that were coupled with the analysed plastic particle sizes of 20 100 and 100 500 μm respectively fig 7 polyethylene terephthalate was negatively associated with chloroplast p value 0 012 and positively associated with flavobacterium p value 0 021 and simplicispira p value 0 009 polypropylene was positively associated with acinetobacter p value 0 001 polystyrene with hydrogenophaga p value 0 001 polyethylene with pseudomonas p value 0 036 isoprene with pseudarcicella p value 0 0001 and polyurethane with synechococcus p value 0 001 polyvinylchloride particles were negatively associated with flavobacterium p value 0 011 and synechococcus p value 0 007 and particles of unknown polymers were positively associated with massilia p value 0 035 and negatively associated with hydrogenophaga p value 0 007 and acinetobacter p value 0 001 pathogens focusing on genera detected in the samples and known to harbour pathogenic species such as acinetobacter pseudomonas legionella mycobacterium and arcobacter we found large particles to be significantly enriched p value 0 001 with acinetobacter relative abundance 14 6 and pseudomonas 2 0 as compared to small particle water like samples 0 7 and 0 8 respectively whereas legionella and mycobacterium were not significantly associated with sample type for arcobacter significantly higher abundances were found in all sample types all p values 0 001 as compared to 500 μm samples virulence and amr genes the virulence genes stx1 and stx2 were not detected in any sample but the amr genes erm b and sul1 were detected in respectively 75 and 79 out of the 80 samples resulting in a prevalence of 93 8 95 ci 80 9 98 2 for erm b and 98 8 95 ci 91 2 99 8 for sul1 the 5 erm b and 1 sul1 negative samples were all 500 μm samples collected in vianen in both summer n 2 and winter n 3 discussion in this study the biofilms of large particles 100 500 μm were found to harbour significantly different microbial communities with decreased diversity as compared to surface water and smaller particles 10 100 μm or smaller this might be related to the relatively larger attachment surface of the significantly more abundant small vs large particles moreover there was a trend towards a more water like microbial community as the residue fraction size became smaller an indication that planktonic microbiota accumulated in the lowest layers of the sieve cascade we also observed more temporal than spatial heterogeneity with season influencing the microbial communities significantly taxon diversity on freshwater microplastics is often lower than the water itself or natural substrates miao et al 2019 jiang et al 2018 mccormick et al 2016 mccormick et al 2014 we also found polypropylene to be significantly more abundant amongst large particles where diversity was the lowest and it has indeed been reported that microbial diversity is particularly low on polypropylene zettler et al 2013 moreover diversity was lower in summer despite microplastic concentrations were higher in summer lower diversity during summertime has been observed in different freshwater environments and seems to be driven by changes in several physicochemical parameters besides temperature garcía armisen et al 2014 previous studies have shown distinct microbial communities between plastic and water samples zettler et al 2013 jiang et al 2018 ogonowski et al 2018 these differences are intriguing as microbial communities exist in close proximity in the river and were collected contemporaneously amongst the most interesting differences was the relatively high abundance of gammaproteobacteria especially acinetobacter pseudomonas thiothrix alkanindiges and betaproteobacteria especially roseateles massilia hydrogenophaga acidovorax on large particles and different bacteroidetes and actinobacteria taxa especially ns11 12 marine group hgci clade pseudarcicella candidatus planktophila on small particle water like samples fig 6 previous studies reported similar findings particularly gammaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria being more abundant on plastic and bacteroidetes and actinobacteria on natural substrates zettler et al 2013 miao et al 2019 mccormick et al 2016 ogonowski et al 2018 certain species belonging to gammaproteobacteria are early biofilm producers on artificial substrates and the genus pseudomonas especially is notorious to thrive on plastics mccormick et al 2016 mccormick et al 2014 exposure to pathogenic pseudomonas species may cause abrasion and ear infections schets et al 2014 and two opportunistic human pathogens pseudomonas monteilii and pseudomonas mendocina and one plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae have been reported to occur exclusively on plastic wu et al 2019 we found pseudomonas to be more abundant in samples with high polyethylene concentrations and pseudomonas is known to be able to biodegrade plastic polymers particularly polyethylene tribedi et al 2015 it is worth stressing that plastic polymer composition and microbial community composition were tested for possible associations in separate samples while such correlative study design allowed us to determine whether the microbial community composition varies depending on the abundance of the different plastic polymers it does not provide the same level of detail as analysing the microbial assemblages of individual plastic pieces of specific polymer types although this study was primarily meant to generate hypotheses rather than testing them most of the aforementioned results about microbial diversity and the different associations between plastic polymers and microbial taxa were previously observed meaning that our results were confirmatory in nature which in turn supports the validity of the analyses in general it follows therefore that our findings support the general notion that microplastics may serve as unique substrates for microbial colonisation and that taxon selection occurs during biofilm development on microplastics resulting in reduced capacity to support diversity miao et al 2019 microplastics are often seen as potential vectors of pathogenic microorganisms miao et al 2019 jiang et al 2018 mccormick et al 2016 in addition to the biofilm associated and possibly plastic degrading taxa taxa that are known to harbour potentially pathogenic species such as pseudomonas acinetobacter and arcobacter as well as the selected amr genes were found while the absence of the stx1 and stx2 genes might be explained by the lack of detectable escherichia and shigella bacteria although these genes are described in other enterobacteriaceae as well it can also be hypothesized that selection taking place in aquatic environments plays a role since these genes would give no immediate advantage for bacterial fitness in such environments conversely amr genes would confer an advantage as antimicrobial residues are present in surface water especially wastewater arias andres et al 2018 imran et al 2019 moreover co selection of multi resistance in microplastic contaminated environments is an emerging risk imran et al 2019 with microplastics acting as hotspots for emerge and spread selective enrichment of certain bacterial pathogens on microplastics has been reported mccormick et al 2016 the genera acinetobacter and pseudomonas which include several potential pathogenic species were significantly more abundant amongst large particles than surface water or small particle water like samples moreover the genus arcobacter which also includes potential pathogens were almost as abundant on the particles as in water but more abundant amongst 100 and 10 μm samples as our analyses did not allow for species identification but only for genera that may contain known pathogenic species further research is needed to confirm these findings 16s rrna gene sequencing is a powerful method to determine microbial community structures but metagenomic sequencing is likely to provide a more detailed picture including microbial species virulence and amr genes as it is particularly useful to determine the genomic potential of different environments this study has several limitations we were not able to fully differentiate plastic from seston particles in the samples unless one manually isolates relatively large plastic particles or uses a controlled weathering experiment in which specific plastic particles of known polymer and concentration are exposed to a given aquatic environment it is hard to isolate and characterize plastic particles from surface water in a way that does not alter or damage their biofilms our method although imperfect allowed us to analyse directly the samples both chemically and microbiologically in parallel furthermore although the samples were not made of 100 plastic the microbial community results were highly

particles had a limited impact and even if the results were not specific for plastic they were likely to be driven by the plastic differences in microbial communities between filtration methods were also observed with the flotation method the fraction of plastic particles that was captured included the floating plastic particles so the results represented mainly the microbiota associated with

both filtration methods were thus complementary to one another in providing data for the whole microbial community in a sample conclusions microplastics were widespread in the analysed samples with concentrations polymer types and microbial communities varying mainly by season and particle size and less by location results were compatible with the existence of taxon selecting mechanisms and reduced microbial diversity in the biofilms of plastic substrates a number of biofilm associated and plastic degrading taxa were enriched in certain types of samples and occurred more abundantly in

17197,microplastics pollution in aquatic ecosystems is of great concern however systemic investigations are still lacking in freshwater wetland systems used for wastewater treatment the present study discusses such freshwater wetland system in eastern india to understand its microplastics transport mechanism heavy metals association and microplastics removal efficiency microplastics 63 µm 5 mm were heavily found in surface water and sediments of treatment ponds 7 87 to 20 39 items l and 2124 84 to 6886 76 items kg and associated wastewater canals 30 46 to 137 72 items l and 1108 78 to 34612 87 items kg a high content of toxic metals as cd cr cu ni pb and zn were found on the microplastics with polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene as major plastics types which were also found in fishes and macroinvertebrates of treatment ponds machine learning algorithm revealed a close association between microplastics content in fishes and surface water indicating risk associated with floating microplastics to the aquatic biota the study also revealed that microplastics were acting as heavy metals vector and potentially causing fish contamination surface water microplastics removing efficiency of the treatment ponds was estimated to be 53 the study bespeaks about transport of microplastics through wastewater canals and their retention in treatment ponds emphasizing sustainability maintenance of natural wastewater treatment systems especially considering microplastics contamination to the aquatic biota of freshwater wetland systems graphical abstract image

due to its potential hazardous effect on both terrestrial and aquatic biota mps are defined as plastics particles having a size less than 5 mm sarkar et al 2019 mps have been extracted from both marine and terrestrial ecosystems and extensively divulged to be ubiquitously distributed around the world sarkar et al 2020 they have been identified as potential indicators of anthropocene and also listed as contaminants of emerging concern cec sarkar et al 2020 being the ultimate sink marine environments are given the major focus on the distribution fate and toxic effects of plastic litters cole et al 2011 however in recent decades considerable research is being focused on the inland rivers since they are being found as the major point source of plastic litter to the sea it was predicted that the yangtze river of china has the global highest plastic discharge 0 33 million tons per year to the sea followed by the ganga river of the indian subcontinent 0 12 million tons per year lebreton et al 2017 the report can be supported by the fact that asian countries are mostly suffering from the generation of mismanaged plastic waste and logically the plastic waste load in their natural stream is measured to be huge jambeck et al 2015 our recent publication reported for the first time on the distribution of mps of different morphotypes in the sediments of ganga river along the lower and estuarine stretch with a varied mass fraction 11 48 to 63 79 ng g sediments and numerical abundance 99 27 409 86 items kg sarkar et al 2019 however studies on the distribution and fate of plastic litters in freshwater systems is still in the nascent stage revealing few major river systems of the world and gaining gradual importance since inland freshwaters especially the fluvial biosystems are marked as the primal pathway for longitudinal dispersion cook et al 2020 and deposition of plastic like materials to the ocean wagner and lambert 2018 although these longitudinal runways in rivers are being meticulously studied worldwide sarkar et al 2019 tien et al 2020 the freshwater microecosystem associated with these rivers like lakes wetlands marshlands etc are given lesser importance selvam et al 2020 however past studies also have confirmed the ubiquitous nature of mps in these freshwater bodies like the great lakes of usa urban lakes of china backwater lake in southern india and canadian watershed lake eriksen et al 2013 su et al 2016 sruthy and ramasamy 2017 anderson et al 2017 wang et al 2018 in the investigation conducted in taihu lake china a larger abundance of mps 3 4 25 8 items l in surface water and 11 0 234 6 items kg in sediments was reported su et al 2016 the quantum of mps in associated urban lakes of the hanjiang river and yangtze river in central china was found to be attributed to population densities and anthropogenic factors like municipal discharge wang et al 2018 utilization of natural wastewater treatment systems was recorded as early as the 1840s in england where it was recognized as a means for removal of pollutants while simultaneously returning nutrients to nature jewell and seabrook 1979 in the 19thcentury it was the only acceptable method for the treatment of wastewater and is being still in practice in developing countries like east kolkata wetland in eastern india the natural wastewater treatment system has been viewed as sustainable ecotechnology for developing countries for its low cost low energy consumption and low mechanical technology requirements mahmood et al 2013 it might include technical means for wastewater conveyance and distribution however does not exclusively depend on external energy sources for major treatment processes here the wastewater is generally treated in a passive sustainable manner using native microbial populations resulting in a system that costs less than other mechanical and chemical treatment alternatives crites et al 2014 it was reported that the biodegradation rate in these natural wastewater treatment systems is very high and wastewater gets stabilized within a few days sarkar et al 2009 crites et al 2014 because wastewater is treated the load of toxic pollutants like heavy metals and other chemical indicators in these treatment wetlands is very high various heavy metals like cd cu mn and pb were found in high concentrations 0 02 0 19 mg l 0 02 0 03 mg l 0 12 3 23 mg l and 0 1 0 92 mg l respectively in these treatment wetland waters khatun et al 2016 though there are many reports on different toxic pollutants and their dynamics in the wastewater treatment wetland system until now there is no information on the transport distribution and fate of mps in such systems because domestic wastewater is treated it is thought that a huge load of mps would be deposited in the natural wetland system damaging the sustainability of the natural wetland system and aquatic biodiversity within zhao et al 2020 further mps have been extensively studied as a vector of toxic heavy metals guo and wang 2020 tang et al 2020 and their combination was reported to cause adverse health effects to the aquatic biota yan et al 2020 with this background the present study reports on the transport and distribution of mps of various color morphotype and size fractions as a vector of heavy metals in a natural wastewater treatment wetland system further the mps contamination in the aquatic biota fin fishes and freshwater snail macroinvertebrates was also investigated to understand the vulnerability of mps load for its sustainability and human health concern 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites in eastern india an agglomeration of low lying freshwater wetlands exists on the eastern side of city kolkata along the river ganga the agglomeration of wetlands is called east kolkata wetland ekw and used for natural wastewater treatment where a substantial amount of city wastewater is efficiently been treated through single pond system gupta et al 2016 the wetland is also used for commercial scale fish culture sarkar et al 2009 gupta et al 2016 and peri urban agrarian cultivation roy basu et al 2020 kolkata municipal corporation kmc is the local authority to cater to the basic services including drainage and solid waste management with a geographical area of 200 71 sq km the corporation holds a population of 4 5 million https censusindia gov in 2011 common censusdata2011 html according to a previous study ekw receives about 600 million liters of wastewater daily which carries more than 2500 tons of garbage dasgupta and panigrahi 2014 the single pond system in ekw was evolved by indigenous people over the preceding century by applying blackbox approach involving different phases viz construction of mud barriers across the wetland area to separate the individual ponds complete removal of water from individual pond followed by drying ploughing and lime treatment introduction of untreated wastewater from city sewage canals and growing of photoautotrophs for the generation of clear water sarkar et al 2009 gupta et al 2016 it was reported that the biodegradation rate of sewage content at ekw pond is very high and wastewatergets stabilized within 10 days of retention sarkar et al 2009 due to the sewage water the load of toxic pollutants like heavy metals cd cu mn and pb in the ekw ponds is very high 0 02 3 23 mg l khatun et al 2016 in the present study a total of eight sites were selected in ekw for sediment and water sampling fig 1 four sites site 1 site 2 site 3 and site 4 are situated on wastewater canals wwc that flow through the dense settlements of kolkata city carrying the plastic debris and release the municipal load to the wetlands the huge municipal load of these canal water acts as nutrient sources to individual treatment ponds of ekw thus flourishing huge photoautotroph algal materials facilitating natural water treatment and major finfish culture with minimum synthetic feed sources to estimate the microplastics load in these ekw treatment ponds tp four sites were selected namely site 5 site 6 site 7 and site 8 the coordinates local names and photographs of the sites are given in table s1 and fig s1 2 2 sample collection and mps extraction sediment and water samples were collected from test sites of ekw during the post monsoon season 20 25 november of 2019 from each wwc site site 1 site 2 site 3 and site 4 wet sediment 2 3 kg at a depth of 10 15 cm samples were collected from 3 locations 50 to 80 m apart using a grab other biological materials including plant debris were removed from the collected wet sediments surface water 50 l was sampled from each wwc site 0 40 cm depth using a steel bucket followed by immediate sieving using a mesh sieve 63 µm and stored in sealed containers from the tp sites site 5 site 6 site 7 and site 8 wet sediment 2 3 kg was collected at three locations 60 90 m apart which are atleast 80 m away from the wastewater entry point similar to canal sites surface water 60 l was sampled from tp sites 0 40 cm depth using a steel bucket followed by immediate sieving using a mesh sieve 63 µm and stored in sealed containers microplastic particles lower than 63 µm were not considered in the present study due to complexity in isolation observation and identification tien et al 2020 it was also reported that microplastics with lower particle size 200 µm showed low retention in freshwater bodies due to homo and heteroaggregation besseling et al 2017 to calculate the removal efficiency mps in raw water just before entry to tp and mps in final treated water were sampled site no 5 to 8 the collected wet sediments 2 3 kg were oven dried binder germany ed 115 at 65 c for 36 h until constant dry mass 1 36 to

bigger plastic particles 5 10 mm and 10 mm are separated by naked eye observation followed by counting and weighing mettler toledo switzerland newclassic ms model ms30002se a01 mps from the sieved sediment and water samples 850 µm 5 mm and 63 850 µm were separated following the density separation method using standard zncl2 solution 1 80 g cm 3 sarkar et al 2019 tien et al 2020 briefly saturated zncl2 thermo fisher scientific inc solution was added to the samples at the ratio 10 1 v w followed by stirring for 15 20 min and keeping suspensions undisturbed overnight the floating particles were separated using the siphoning technique and collected on filter paper glass microfibre filter pore size 0 7 μm over a buckner flask connected to a vacuum pump the accumulated floating debris was washed repeatedly with deionized water to remove traces of salt solution followed by digestion 1 3 w v with 30 hydrogen peroxide solution for 3 h until complete digestion of biological materials the remaining undigestable plastic debris was washed with deionized water repeatedly using vacuum filtration glass microfibre filter pore size 0 7 μm the density separation and digestion process were repeated for the second time until only plastic materials remain on the filter followed by drying in a vacuum desiccator for 36 h the filter was weighed before vacuum filtration to get precise plastic content in each fraction during all steps no plastic equipment was used and proper care was taken to prevent contamination with other mps 2 3 biological samples and mpsextraction biological samples were collected from test tp sites using experimental fishing using a cast net 10 15 mm mesh and stored with ice in a sealed container for further processing different species of major fin fishes viz labeo rohita l bata l catla oreochromis niloticus cirrhinus mrigala minor fin fishes viz chanda nama and puntius sophore and freshwater snails macroinvertebrates viz lymnaea acuminata and indoplanorbis exustus were collected the fishes were rinsed with distilled water and dissected to remove the entire gastrointestinal gi tract from esophagus to cloaca followed by complete digestion with 30 h2o2 at 70 c to degrade the remaining organic materials gbogbo et al 2020 in case of smaller fish species 10 g and snail the gi tract and entire body mass respectively were pooled together and digested as above the digested solution was then filtered for plastic examination however to understand the co contaminant correlation between heavy metals in mps and fish l rohita

learning algorithm r rtsne chen et al 2020a were performed to elucidate the relation between mps fraction collected from fishes with spatially variable mps fraction measured in the surface water and sediment of wwc and tp sites duncan multiple test range dmrt analysis was done in sas package to find the difference between heavy metal concentrations in sampled sediments water and mps regression analysis was performed to analyze the relationship between mean mps concentration with chemical indicators viz ph specific conductivity total n and total p tests were considered significant at p 0 05 chen et al 2020a 3 results 3 1 mps distribution in wwc and tp diverse types of mps 63 µm 5 mm were extracted from the sediments of wwc besides other macro 10 mm and mesoplastics 5 10 mm fractions fig 2 they are classified into various morphotypes film fibre fragments beads and foam and color types red yellow green blue grey white black and transparent fig 2 a depicts the optical microscope images of mps extracted from the sediments of site 1 fig 2 a 1 site 2 fig 2 a 2 site 3 fig 2 a 3 and site 4 fig 2 a 4 the number and weight percent of these morphocolor types are presented in fig 2 b 1 n and 1 w 2 n and 2 w 3 n and 3 w and 4 n and 4 w it can be observed that maximum variation in the number and weight distribution of morphocolor types are present in the 850 µm 5 mm size fractions and the 63 850 µm size fraction is majorly dominated by two morphocolor types viz transparent film 80 95 and multi color fibres 5 20 in the 850 µm 5 mm size fraction the biggest contribution came from fragments 74 followed by the transparent film 15 at site 1 transparent film 70 followed by red fragments 7 at site 2 white fibre 28 and blue fragments 27 8 followed by the transparent film 16 at site 3 and black fibre 76 followed by the transparent film 20 at site 4 a similar trend was observed in the weight distribution of different morphocolor types in the wwc sediment mps the mean concentration items g and mg kg of plastic litters including mps in the wwc sediments with different morphotypes is presented in table 1 indicating three times higher load of plastic litters with 5 mm size in the wwc sediments as compared to tp sediments ft ir analysis showed that pe polyethylene and pet polyethylene terephthalate are the dominant mps types 850 µm 5 mm in wwc sediment and the percentage of pe 37 50 was more than pet 31 45 fig s2 it is interesting to note that the surface water 0 40 cm of wwc mainly contained 63 850 µm mps with limited morphotypes film fibre and fragments and their number items l and weight mg l distribution is presented in the fig 2 c and d respectively in the wwc water the concentration of film fibre and fragments ranged between 0 0 to 11 23 2 94 items l 11 20 2 00 to 19 44 2 95 items l and 11 5 1 75 to 107 05 17 50 items l respectively percentage distribution of mps with varied morphocolor types in the surface water of wwcs is presented in fig s2 a fig 3 a depicts the optical microscope images of mps extracted from the tp sediments at site 5 fig 3 a 1 site 6 fig 3 a 2 site 7 fig 3 a 3 and site 8 fig 3 a 4 similar to wwc sediments the maximum variation in the number and weight distribution of morphocolor types is present in the 850 µm 5 mm size fractions however more variation was observed in the morphocolor types of 63 850 µm mps size fraction as compared to wwc sediments in the 850 µm 5 mm size fraction the maximum contribution came from translucent fragments 45 followed by the transparent film 36 at site 5 transparent film 73 followed by transparent fragments 11 at site 6 transparent fragments 53 followed by translucent fragments 43 at site 7 and transparent fragments 54 followed by translucent fragments 19 at site 8 in the 63 850 µm size fraction the biggest contribution came from transparent fragments 43 followed by translucent fragments 38 at site 5 translucent fragments 77 followed by transparent fragments 17 at site 6 translucent fragments 48 followed by transparent fragments 36 at site 7 and transparent fragments 36 and transparent film 36 followed by translucent fragments 28 at site 8 a similar trend was observed in the weight distribution of different morphocolor types in the tp sediment mps table 1 also shows that the bigger plastic litters 5 mm were nearly absent in the tp sediments however the mean concentration items kg and mg kg of mps in the tp sediments was comparable with wwc sediments it was observed that pe and pet were dominant mps 850 µm 5 mm in the tp sediments and the percentage of pet 34 81 was more than pe 12 61 fig s3 similar to wwc the surface water column 0 40 cm of tp mainly contained 63 850 µm mps with limited morphotypes film fibre and fragments and their number items l and weight mg l distribution is presented in the fig 3 c and d respectively in the pond water the concentration of film fibre and fragments ranged between 0 0 to1 9 0 45 items l 2 05 2 00 to 11 21 3 00 items l and 5 75 1 31 to 15 10 4 94 items l respectively this is to note that the mps content in the treated pond water was much lower than the wastewater canal the percentage distribution of mps with varied morphocolor types in the surface water of tps is presented in fig s2 b 3 2 mps in fishes and macroinvertebrates of tps fig 4 depicts microscopic images of the mps extracted from the gi tract and body mass of biological samples from tp sites it was observed that all the biological samples in the present study contained mps in the guts of fishes and the body mass of macroinvertebrates however the mps contamination by the 850 µm 5 mm size fraction is very low and maximum was done by the 63 850 µm size fractions the mps 850 µm 5 mm extracted from the fish samples were identified using atr ft ir and found that they belong to mainly pe and pet class of plastics the mps particle 850 µm 5 mm extracted from the l rohita gut belonged to pet with characteristics ir spectrum at 1714 cm 1 c o stretching vibration 1234 cm 1 c o stretching vibration 1016 cm 1 c o c stretching vibrations and 724 cm 1 aromatic c h out of plane bending fig 4 1 however mps particle 850 µm 5 mm extracted from the l bata showed major spectra of both pe 2940 cm 1 c h symmetric stretching vibration and 2855 cm 1 c h asymmetric stretching vibration and pet 1730 cm 1 c o stretching vibration 1221 cm 1 c o stretching vibration and 1101 cm 1 c o c stretching vibrations fig 4 2 the mps particles 850 µm 5 mm extracted from the identified macroinvertebrates l acuminata and i exustus belongs to pe with characteristics ir spectrum at 2916 2917 cm 1 c h asymmetric stretching vibration 2868 cm 1 c h symmetric stretching vibration and 1456 cm 1 c h bending vibration fig 4 3 and 4 since the mps content 63 850 µm is very low as compared to the sediment and water column the fish gut content was dyed with a fluorescent dye nr staining for better observation and counting of the mps fig 4 a to hdepicts the fluorescent microscope images of mps 63 850 µm extracted from fishes p sophore c nama c mrigala l bata o niloticus l rohita and macroinvertebrates l acuminata and i exustus the number distribution of mps at different size ranges 850 µm 5 mm and 63 850 µm and morphotypes extracted from fishes and macroinvertebrates are presented in table 2 it was observed that fragmented mps were dominated in the fish gut samples followed by fibre and film 3 3 statistical analysis of mps distribution fig 5 a shows the spatial segmentation of mps items kg of sediment number l of water and number per fish in the sampled sediment water and fish gut which followed the order wwc sediment tp sediment wwc water tpwater fish gut pca of the number distribution of mps in the sediment water and fish revealed that the three principal components encompassed a majority of variation 85 73 fig 5 b positive pc1 was correlated with the number distribution of mps in surface water of wwc and tp and fish guts whereas negative pc1 was correlated with the number distribution of mps in the tp sediments the number distribution of mps in wwc sediments were more correlated with the negative pc2 similarly pca of the weight distribution of mps mg kg of sediment mg l of water in the sediment and surface water of wwc and tp fig s4 revealed that the three principal components encompassed the majority of variation 63 29 the study also found that positive pc1 and negative pc1 were correlated with the weight distribution of mps in the surface water column and sediment of wwc and tp sites respectively machine learning algorithm t distributed stochastic neighbor embedding t sne cluster analysis perplexity 10 showed that number distribution of mps in the fish gut 5 fish 6 fish 7 fish and 8 fish was more associated with number distribution of mps in the surface water of tp 5 tp wat 6 tp wat 7 tp wat 8 tp wat fig 5 c number distribution of mps in tp sediment 5 tp sed 6 tp sed 7 tp sed 8 tp sed was found to be more associated with surface water of wwc sites 1 wwc wat 2 wwc wat 3 wwc wat 4 wwc wat fig 5 c it is interesting to note that two separate clusters exist between the number distribution of mps in wwc sediments and tp sites similarly t sne cluster analysis was done on the weight distribution of mps in sediment and surface water of wwc and tp sites fig s5 which revealed that mps content in surface water of wwc and tp was more associated t sne cluster analysis was also done on the number and weight distribution of different size fraction 10 mm 5 10 mm 850 µm 5 mm and 63 850 µm of plastics and mps with varied morphotypes film fibre fragments foam and beads to understand any relationship between the different morphotypes fig s6 it was observed that no definite cluster formed between size and morphotypes based on number distribution however based on weight distribution a strong association was observed between 5 10 mm film and 850 µm 5 mm film strongly indicating the origin of small sized films due to weathering of bigger plastic films in the wwc and tp network correlation statistics of number distribution of mps items kg of sediment and items l of water with chemical indicators viz ph specific conductivity µs cm total n mg l and total p mg l was conducted and depicted in fig 5 d it shows that no correlation exists between the ph and specific conductivity of water and sediment of wwc and tp sites p 0 05 however a significant correlation was observed between mps number distribution and total n content r2 0 87 p 0 0001 followed by total p r2 0 32 p 0 0253 similarly correlation statistics of weight distribution of mps mg kg of sediment and mg l of water with chemical indicators viz ph specific conductivity µs cm total n ppm and total p ppm was done however no correlation was found between these parameters with p 0 05 fig s7 3 4 heavy metal distribution and mps removal efficiency the heavy metal concentrations in the sediment surface water fish muscle and mps are presented in table 3 since wastewater is being treated through the system a high concentration of heavy metals was found in the test sediments 3 3 351 75 µg g mps also contained a high concentration of heavy metals on their surface 0 04 439 32 µg g as compared to water samples 0 13 345 59 µg l indicating their role as a potential vector in transporting the same due to the natural treatment process the apparent mean heavy metal concentrations were found reduced in the surface water of tp as compared to wwc however the values are not found with statistically significant differences except for zn and ni p value 0 0009 the concentration of heavy metals on the mps surface remained the same with statistically nonsignificant differences p value 0 2572 it was further revealed that cr cu ni pb and zn were heavily found on the mps surface among others the partition coefficient of heavy metals on mps surface from the water was estimated using the following equation selvam et al 2020 k m p w m e p m e w where mep indicates the metal concentration on the mps surface and mew indicates metal concentration in the water it was observed that the kmpwvalue in the tps was considerably high as compared to wwcs table 3 which might be due to the longer retention of mps particles in the tps further in the tps as and cr showed high kmpw values as compared to others the heavy metal content in the fish muscle l rohita collected from tps was estimated and it was found that a considerable amount 0 73 to 49 62 µg g of heavy metal exists in the muscle the concentration of heavy metal in fish muscle followed the order zn cu cr pb ni as cd table 3 the t sne cluster analysis of metal content in fish muscle mps water and sediment fig 6 a revealed that heavy metal content in fish muscle was more associated with the metal content of mps extracted from tps fig 6 b shows the mps level in the raw wastewater just before the entry to the tps and treated water at the outer channel the maximum mps level in the rawwater was found at site 8 followed by site 7 and site 6 site 5 however the maximum removal efficiency was found at site 6 with 73 efficiency followed by site 8 with 58 on average the mps removal efficiency by the tps was found to be 53 35 15 35 further it was observed that films were readily removed from the wastewater as compared to other morphotypes 4 disscussion 4 1 mps discharge to tps municipal discharge through sewage canals is reported to be highly polluted and caused significant contribution in aggravating mps pollution issues in the aquatic environment the influent of a sewage treatment plant stp in china was reported to contain mps at a concentration of 12 03 1 29 items l yang et al 2019 on average the influents of stp situated in various countries like germany finland sweden canada etc were reported to contain mps at 15 1 to 640 items l and the effluent contained no detectable to 65 items l kang et al 2018 a separate study further reported that the mps level in the sewage influents ranged from 1 item l to 7216 items l and the final effluent contains no detectable to 81 items l gatidou et al 2019 so it can be assessed that municipal wastewater carries a huge load of mps and in developed countries like usa germany etc the mps level in the final discharge effluent to natural stream is reduced through stp however this study for the first time delineates the issues of mps contamination of a natural wastewater treatment wetland system which is still a very common system for wastewater treatment in underdeveloped or developing countries like india this study implicates the wwc as an important source of mps to the tp it was revealed in the present study that a huge number of mps are distributed in the wwcs associated with ekw and our results demonstrated that wwcs are the key pathways for mps entry to tp of ekw previously wastewater treatment plant wwtp and stp effluent were reported as the main source of mps in the aquatic environment like in canada wastewater effluent to lake ontario contains 13 3 15 5 mps items l grbić et al 2020 in the present study on average the sediments and surface water of wwc contained mps 1108 78 to 34612 87 items kg and 30 46 to 137 72 items l respectively the mp concentration in the influents of stps was reported to be 15 1 items l in sweden magnusson and norén 2014 610 items l in finland talvitie et al 2015 0 4 to 3 2 items l in finland talvitie et al 2017 133 0 35 3 items l in the usa michielssen et al 2016 etc hence it can be assessed that the transport of mps through wwcs to ekw tps is comparable with the reported level of mps in the influents of stp or wwtp in other countries in the wwc sediments the maximum variation based on morphocolor types in mps distribution was present in the 850 µm 5 mm size fractions this could be due to a high percentage of less weathered multi colored plastic particles in the wwc liu et al 2020 the 63 850 µm size fraction was mainly dominated by transparent film and multi color fibres the dominance of fibres can be explained by the immediate release of textile fibres from domestic wastewater into these canals it was heavily reported that fibres are the dominant form of mps in domestic effluents which eventually contaminates the freshwater natural streams and marine environments dris et al 2016 hernandez et al 2017 the surface water of wwcs was predominantly contained mps in the size fraction of 63 850 µm similar results were reported from other countries where mps were tested for their presence in the influents of stp at the size range of 20 200 µm finland talvitie et al 2015 20 400 µm usa michielssen et al 2016 20 300 µm russia hidalgo ruz et al 2012 it was observed that the concentration of macro 10 mm and mesoplastics 5 10 mm in the wwc sediments is three times higher as compared to tp sediments however mps concentration 5mm in both wwc and tp sediments is comparable and in many cases the load of mps in tp sediments is higher than wwc sediments for example the number and mass concentration of film type of mps 850 µm 5 mm in the sediments of tp site 6 is higher 829 66 120 14 items kg and 149 94 63 46 mg kg than all the wwc sediments 34 67 7 03 to 236 85 54 41items kg and 15 01 9 06 to 72 92 44 43 mg kg this observation infers limited entry of bigger plastic particles litters in the tp through the wwc however the load of mps from the wwc gets deposited in the tp leading to a higher abundance of mps in the later this might be due to the presence of a physical screening barrier made of bamboo sticks between tp and wwc gupta et al 2016 which could reduce the entry of bigger plastics but may not be efficient enough to reduce the inflow of mps in the tp it is evident from fig 5 a that the number distribution of mps in the sediments of both wwc and tp were comparable but pca fig 5 b and fig s2 revealed a strong correlation between wwc and tp surface water mps which infers that floating or low density mps of wwc water is directly influencing the tp mps rather than the insitu mps load in the tp sediments pca analysis fig 5 b also revealed that the number distributions of mps in tp sediments were less associated with each other and also with the wwc sediments indicating differential mps loading process of individual tp by the wwc this differential mps loading of individual tp can be explained by different mps load of wwc or any other physical properties like flow rate physical distance etc pca was also done to describe the distribution of mps in different locations of the wei river of china where it was found that fibre mps are associated more with surface water ding et al 2019 previously pca was used in many studies to establish the correlation between mps abundance with various environmental parameters sarkar et al 2019 chen et al 2020a a study in the huangpu river and its tributary suzhou creek in shanghai megacity revealed that mps concentration was highly associated with total soluble solid tss and humic chen et al 2020a in the ganga river it was established by the pca that mps abundance is more correlated with specific conductivity and available phosphate content of the sediments sarkar et al 2019 regression analysis of mps fig 5 d distribution with chemical indicators ph specific conductivity total n and total p indicates that it was poorly correlated with ph and specific conductivity however a strong regression coefficient p value 0 0001 was found with total n which indicates that besides total p association exists between mps abundance and total n in the aquatic bodies an assessment of the river environment in japan also found a strong correlation between mps concentration with total n content of water kataoka et al 2019 however an inverse correlation was reported in wwtps where influents with high total n and low mps concentration decreased to effluent with high mps and less total n bayo et al 2020 it was also reported that mps associated biofilms could alter the nitrogen and phosphorous cycling process of the aquatic system chen et al 2020b cluster analysis through t sne fig 5 c and fig s4 also revealed a strong association between mps distribution in surface water of wwc and tp sites further t sne analysis fig s5 revealed that weight distribution of 63 850 µm mps varied from other size fractions indicating a possible differential occurrence of this fine mps fraction which might be directly originated from the domestic source rather than in situ weathering at the wwc or tp site from bigger mps fraction 850 µm 5 mm however the same study also revealed a strong association between 5 10 mm film and 850 µm 5 mm film indicating the origin of small sized films though in situ weathering of bigger plastic films at wwc and tp sites previously the t sne machine learning algorithm was used for cluster analysis of morphological characteristics and polymer compositions of mps which showed that reservoir samples were significantly different from the river and creek samples chen et al 2020a t sne was also used to visualize the non linear relationship between nir spectra and corresponding information on plastic pollution on soil samples qui et al 2020 4 2 mps contamination in fishes and macroinvertebrates natural wastewater treatment wetland system like ekw is also celebrated for converting waste to wealth through successfully commercial fish cultivation in the tps sarkar et al 2009 gupta et al 2016 since wastewater is influent to the tp mps contamination in the major aquatic biota of tp is also investigated in the present study it was previously reported that due to the tiny size of micro and nanoplastics they are bioavailable across the trophic food chain free et al 2014 the ingestion scenario is more clear among marine biota viz invertebrates goldstein and goodwin 2013 fish davison and asch 2011 seabirds ryan et al 2009 and mammals fossi et al 2014 imposing reduced feeding energy storage and other ecophysiological disorders due to physical injury physiological stress and false satiation in their body as per organismal studies of mps in freshwater resources of europe north america and asia it is evident that freshwater fauna is equally impacted by the ingestion of mps at different trophic guild eerkes medrano et al 2015 moreover freshwaters are highly acceptable for human consumption and drinking purposes which creates concerns surrounding human ingestion of mps therefore to fulfill the limited understanding of the mps impact on the freshwater ecosystem it is of paramount importance to strengthen the database on the distribution of tiny plastics debris at each trophic niche t sne cluster analysis revealed that the number distribution of mps in the fish gut was more associated with the number distribution of mps in the surface water of tp and wwc sites fig 5 b thus it can be inferred that the level of mp contamination in fin fishes is mainly due to low density or floating mps content of the tp water which is fed by the wwc it was reported that planktivores filter feeders and suspension feeders inhabiting in the upper column of the aquatic ecosystem prefer low density pe specific gravity 0 91 0 94 wright et al 2013 on the contrary high density plastics like pvc poly vinyl chloride density 1 38 are more likely to deposit as benthic suspension and make available for detritivores and benthic organisms in the present study pet was detected in the gut of omnivorous column feeder l rohita and pe pet in l bata from tp site 6 small fishes like eastern mosquito fish gambusia holbrooki were considered as a model species for ecotoxicological and environmental monitoring studies and this fish species was studied recently for biomonitoring of mps in the natural freshwater habitats of the greater melbourne area su et al 2019 thus the present study also deliberated to understand the contamination level of mps in the locally available indigenous small fishes viz c nama and p sophore a larger abundance of fragments and fibrous mps 63 850 µm was found in the gut content of c nama and p sophore at tp site 7 the color of ingested particles plays a pivotal role in getting engulfed by the larger predator organisms besseling et al 2014 similarly colored plastic particles have a greater tendency to be observed in the food chain at the next level da costa et al 2016 it was evident from the previous study that few colored plastics such as tan and yellow particles resembling zooplankton are preferred by many fishes and their larvae as food shaw and day 1994 recently a study encountered that white plastic particles are present in more than 5 of oceanic fishes in the north sea and baltic sea rummel et al 2016 similarly in the present study white light yellow or green colored plastic particles were found in the guts or body mass of fishes and test macroinvertebrates macroinvertebrates were reported to bioaccumulate high concentrations of mps for example edible freshwater shellfish asian clam corbicula fluminea from freshwater lake taihu china su et al 2016 filter feeding marine bivalves scapharca cornea from setiu wetland malaysia is also reported to engulf pe and polyamide type filaments ibrahim et al 2016 due to abandoned fishing gear and nets the study is corroborated with the present findings where microfibres 63 850 µm were found in the gut of freshwater macroinvertebrates l acuminata and i exustus table 2 fig 4 4 and g h in tp site 5 macroinvertebrates are also suggested as bioindicators for mps pollution in the freshwater sediments due to their high mps accumulation capacity su et al 2018 4 3 mps as heavy metal vector mps have been reported as a vector for transporting toxic pollutants viz pop heavy metals etc in the aquatic ecosystem guo and wang 2020 tang et al 2020 and reported to cause hazardous effects to aquatic biota brennecke et al 2016 mintenig et al 2020 however the report on the co occurrence of mps as a vector of heavy metal is scanty especially from the freshwater wetland ecosystem of india previously mps have been reported as a vector of heavy metals as cu cd cr pb mn and zn in the groundwater and surface water of coastal south india selvam et al 2020 the present study also shows that mps extracted from the wwcs and tps are heavily loaded with heavy metals viz as cd cr cu ni pb and zn however the partition coefficient of these heavy metals on mps surface varied based on the type of metals and water system viz canals wwc and ponds tp in the tps the partition coefficient was found to be higher as compared to wwc which might be due to retention of mps for a longer duration and aging of mps in the system vedolin et al 2018 it was previously reported that the adsorption of heavy metals on the mps surfaces increased due to an increase in the retention time brennecke et al 2016 further t sne cluster analysis discovered that heavy metal abundance in the fish muscle was associated with the heavy metal content of the mps extracted from tps this fact enumerates that mps are acting as possible heavy metals carriers thus contaminating fish in the previous section it was discussed that colored mps pe and pet are readily ingested by the fish species and these plastic chemical types are reported to have good heavy metal adsorption capacity selvam et al 2020 pb cr and zn were reported to have higher adsorption tendencies on the pe surfaces godoy et al 2019 it was reported that heavy metals can also easily adsorbed on the suspended particulate matter spm due to its high surface area and reactivity liu et al 2016 the spm partition coefficients of as cd cu pb and zn were ranged from 4 09 6 20 in the bejian river system li et al 2018 however heavy metals were reported to have a high tendency to adsorb on the mps with a higher partition coefficient for example heavy metals as cd cr cu pb mn and zn showed high mps partition coefficient values 0 23 25 36 in groundwater selvam et al 2020 the study corroborated with the present finding with high mps partition coefficient kpw values 2 28 23 50 4 4 mps removal efficiency wwtps are reported to be an important source of mps in the aquatic ecosystems and their efficiencies in the removing mps were evaluated in many countries magnusson and norén 2014 dris et al 2015 michielssen et al 2016 grbić et al 2020 however until now there is no such study in the natural wastewater treatment wetland system thus in the present study mps were estimated at the entry and outer channel of the tps to evaluate its mps removal efficiency the mps removal efficiency of the wastewater treatment wetland system was found to be around 50 which is very much lower than other treatment systems with advanced technologies wwtp in france was reported to remove 84 94 of fibrous mps through primary and biological treatment dris et al 2015 wwtp in china was reported to remove 97 67 98 46 microplastics through primary secondary and tertiary treatment processes yuan et al 2020 the average microplastics removal efficiency of wwtps with tertiary treatment shows more than 97 removal efficiency sun et al 2019 however the removal efficiency of the present natural wetland system was found to be comparable with few studies like 43 in wwtp with primary and secondary treatment processes in china ding et al 2020 48 73 in wwtp with secondary and tertiary treatment process in turkey akarsu et al 2020 and 53 33 in wwtp with mechanical chemical and biological treatment processes in sweden ziajahromi et al 2016 in the present study it was also found that microplastics films 80 9 were better removed by the treatment process as compared to the fibres 67 91 and fragments 41 23 however a previous study reports that fibres are easily removed by advanced wwtp with preliminary and primary treatment process due to easily entrapped in the flocculating particles and separation by sedimentation talvitie et al 2015 ziajahromi et al 2016 fragments are reported to remain after primary treatment and due to neutral buoyancy they can be removed only through the secondary treatment process sun et al 2019 it was envisaged that the mps removal efficiency of the present wetland system can be improved further by the installation of an efficient filter system in the inlet point between wwc and tp sites for screening mps so that mps could not enter into the tps previously it was reported that membrane bioreactors can remove 99 9 mps followed by sand filter 97 mps dissolved air flotation 95 mps and disc filter 40 98 5 mps during the wastewater treatment process talvitie et al 2017 previous study also have examined aluminum al and iron fe based salts for pe microplastics removal in water treatment process through coagulation followed by ultrafiltration ma et al 2019 5 conclusion the present study is the first to provide insights on the role of wastewater canals in mediating mps transportation to east kolkata wetland a natural wastewater treatment wetland system ultimately providing cognizance on mps contamination of ecologically important wetland systems the present finding also contributes in filling the knowledge gap on the occurrence fate and removal of mps in the natural wastewater treatment wetland system the key findings are 1 because of wastewater sources wwc the natural wetland system are being heavily contaminated with mps 2 the macro and mesoplastics load was higher 3 times in the wwcs sediments as compared to individual tps where the load of mps 850 µm to 5 mm was higher 2 5 times 3 natural biota freshwater macroinvertebrates and finfishes of the tps were found contaminated with mps 4 mps contamination in tps fishes were found positively correlated with surface water mps than the sediment mps 5 wastewater and mps were carrying a large amount of toxic heavy metals 1 03 345 6 µg l and 2 03 191 01 µg g respectively 6 tps fishes were also found co contaminated with toxic heavy metals through bioconcentration and biomagnifications besides possible ingestion of metal loaded mps 7 the natural wastewater treatment process was found to remove mps with a removal efficiency of around 50 the study indicates that the ecologically diverse natural wetland system is facing the risk of mps pollution and like other ecologically important contaminants it has reached all the trophic state hampering and stressing the biological integrity of the wetland system finally the study emphasizes the attention needed to be given to reduce various ecological stresses caused by mps pollution in the natural wetland system through the implementation of environmental management measures to maintain its sustainability and ecosystem

17197,microplastics pollution in aquatic ecosystems is of great concern however systemic investigations are still lacking in freshwater wetland systems used for wastewater treatment the present study discusses such freshwater wetland system in eastern india to understand its microplastics transport mechanism heavy metals association and microplastics removal efficiency microplastics 63 µm 5 mm were heavily found in surface water and sediments of treatment ponds 7 87 to 20 39 items l and 2124 84 to 6886 76 items kg and associated wastewater canals 30 46 to 137 72 items l and 1108 78 to 34612 87 items kg a high content of toxic metals as cd cr cu ni pb and zn were found on the microplastics with polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene as major plastics types which were also found in fishes and macroinvertebrates of treatment ponds machine learning algorithm revealed a close association between microplastics content in fishes and surface water indicating risk associated with floating microplastics to the aquatic biota the study also revealed that microplastics were acting as heavy metals vector and potentially causing fish contamination surface water microplastics removing efficiency of the treatment ponds was estimated to be 53 the study bespeaks about transport of microplastics through wastewater canals and their retention in treatment ponds emphasizing sustainability maintenance of natural wastewater treatment systems especially considering microplastics contamination to the aquatic biota of freshwater wetland systems graphical abstract image

transformed infrared spectroscopy pe polyethylene pet polyethylene terephthalate pp polypropylene ps polystyrene 1 introduction microplastics mps pollution is one of the leading environmental problems due to its potential hazardous effect on both terrestrial and aquatic biota mps are defined as plastics particles having a size less than 5 mm sarkar et al 2019 mps have been extracted from both marine and terrestrial ecosystems and extensively divulged to be ubiquitously distributed around the world sarkar et al 2020 they have been identified as potential indicators of anthropocene and also listed as contaminants of emerging concern cec sarkar et al 2020 being the ultimate sink marine environments are given the major focus on the distribution fate and toxic effects of plastic litters cole et al 2011 however in recent decades considerable research is being focused on the inland rivers since they are being found as the major point source of plastic litter to the sea it was predicted that the yangtze river of china has the global highest plastic discharge 0 33 million tons per year to the sea followed by the ganga river of the indian subcontinent 0 12 million tons per year lebreton et al 2017 the report can be supported by the fact that asian countries are mostly suffering from the generation of mismanaged plastic waste and logically the plastic waste load in their natural stream is measured to be huge jambeck et al 2015 our recent publication reported for the first time on the distribution of mps of different morphotypes in the sediments of ganga river along the lower and estuarine stretch with a varied mass fraction 11 48 to 63 79 ng g sediments and numerical abundance 99 27 409 86 items kg sarkar et al 2019 however studies on the distribution and fate of plastic litters in freshwater systems is still in the nascent stage revealing few major river systems of the world and gaining gradual importance since inland freshwaters especially the fluvial biosystems are marked as the primal pathway for longitudinal dispersion cook et al 2020 and deposition of plastic like materials to the ocean wagner and lambert 2018 although these longitudinal runways in rivers are being meticulously studied worldwide sarkar et al 2019 tien et al 2020 the freshwater microecosystem associated with these rivers like lakes wetlands marshlands etc are given lesser importance selvam et al 2020 however past studies also have confirmed the ubiquitous nature of mps in these freshwater bodies like the great lakes of usa urban lakes of china backwater lake in southern india and canadian watershed lake eriksen et al 2013 su et al 2016 sruthy and ramasamy 2017 anderson et al 2017 wang et al 2018 in the investigation conducted in taihu lake china a larger abundance of mps 3 4 25 8 items l in surface water and 11 0 234 6 items kg in sediments was reported su et al 2016 the quantum of mps in associated urban lakes of the hanjiang river and yangtze river in central china was found to be attributed to population densities and anthropogenic factors like municipal discharge wang et al 2018 utilization of natural wastewater treatment systems was recorded as early as the 1840s in england where it was recognized as a means for removal of pollutants while simultaneously returning nutrients to nature jewell and seabrook 1979 in the 19thcentury it was the only acceptable method for the treatment of wastewater and is being still in practice in developing countries like east kolkata wetland in eastern india the natural wastewater treatment system has been viewed as sustainable ecotechnology for developing countries for its low cost low energy consumption and low mechanical technology requirements mahmood et al 2013 it might include technical means for wastewater conveyance and distribution however does not exclusively depend on external energy sources for major treatment processes here the wastewater is generally treated in a passive sustainable manner using native microbial populations resulting in a system that costs less than other mechanical and chemical treatment alternatives crites et al 2014 it was reported that the biodegradation rate in these natural wastewater treatment systems is very high and wastewater gets stabilized within a few days sarkar et al 2009 crites et al 2014 because wastewater is treated the load of toxic pollutants like heavy metals and other chemical indicators in these treatment wetlands is very high various heavy metals like cd cu mn and pb were found in high concentrations 0 02 0 19 mg l 0 02 0 03 mg l 0 12 3 23 mg l and 0 1 0 92 mg l respectively in these treatment wetland waters khatun et al 2016 though there are many reports on different toxic pollutants and their dynamics in the wastewater treatment wetland system until now there is no information on the transport distribution and fate of mps in such systems because domestic wastewater is treated it is thought that a huge load of mps would be deposited in the natural wetland system damaging the sustainability of the natural wetland system and aquatic biodiversity within zhao et al 2020 further mps have been extensively studied as a vector of toxic heavy metals guo and wang 2020 tang et al 2020 and their combination was reported to cause adverse health effects to the aquatic biota yan et al 2020 with this background the present study reports on the transport and distribution of mps of various color morphotype and size fractions as a vector of heavy metals in a natural wastewater treatment wetland system further the mps contamination in the aquatic biota fin fishes and freshwater snail macroinvertebrates was also investigated to understand the vulnerability of mps load for its sustainability and human health concern 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites in eastern india an agglomeration of low lying freshwater wetlands exists on the eastern side of city kolkata along the river ganga the agglomeration of wetlands is called east kolkata wetland ekw and used for natural wastewater treatment where a substantial amount of city wastewater is efficiently been treated through single pond system gupta et al 2016 the wetland is also used for commercial scale fish culture sarkar et al 2009 gupta et al 2016 and peri urban agrarian cultivation roy basu et al 2020 kolkata municipal corporation kmc is the local authority to cater to the basic services including drainage and solid waste management with a geographical area of 200 71 sq km the corporation holds a population of 4 5 million https censusindia gov in 2011 common censusdata2011 html according to a previous study ekw receives about 600 million liters of wastewater daily which carries more than 2500 tons of garbage dasgupta and panigrahi 2014 the single pond system in ekw was evolved by indigenous people over the preceding century by applying blackbox approach involving different phases viz construction of mud barriers across the wetland area to separate the individual ponds complete removal of water from individual pond followed by drying ploughing and lime treatment introduction of untreated wastewater from city sewage canals and growing of photoautotrophs for the generation of clear water sarkar et al 2009 gupta et al 2016 it was reported that the biodegradation rate of sewage content at ekw pond is very high and wastewatergets stabilized within 10 days of retention sarkar et al 2009 due to the sewage water the load of toxic pollutants like heavy metals cd cu mn and pb in the ekw ponds is very high 0 02 3 23 mg l khatun et al 2016 in the present study a total of eight sites were selected in ekw for sediment and water sampling fig 1 four sites site 1 site 2 site 3 and site 4 are situated on wastewater canals wwc that flow through the dense settlements of kolkata city carrying the plastic debris and release the municipal load to the wetlands the huge municipal load of these canal water acts as nutrient sources to individual treatment ponds of ekw thus flourishing huge photoautotroph algal materials facilitating natural water treatment and major finfish culture with minimum synthetic feed sources to estimate the microplastics load in these ekw treatment ponds tp four sites were selected namely site 5 site 6 site 7 and site 8 the coordinates local names and photographs of the sites are given in table s1 and fig s1 2 2 sample collection and mps extraction sediment and water samples were collected from test sites of ekw during the post monsoon season 20 25 november of 2019 from each wwc site site 1 site 2 site 3 and site 4 wet sediment 2 3 kg at a depth of 10 15 cm samples were collected from 3 locations 50 to 80 m apart using a grab other biological materials including plant debris were removed from the collected wet sediments surface water 50 l was sampled from each wwc site 0 40 cm depth using a steel bucket followed by immediate sieving using a mesh sieve 63 µm and stored in sealed containers from the tp sites site 5 site 6 site 7 and site 8 wet sediment 2 3 kg was collected at three locations 60 90 m apart which are atleast 80 m away from the wastewater entry point similar to canal sites surface water 60 l was sampled from tp sites 0 40 cm depth using a steel bucket followed by immediate sieving using a mesh sieve 63 µm and stored in sealed containers microplastic particles lower than 63 µm were not considered in the present study due to complexity in isolation observation and identification tien et al 2020 it was also reported that microplastics with lower particle size 200 µm showed low retention in freshwater bodies due to homo and heteroaggregation besseling et al 2017 to calculate the removal efficiency mps in raw water just before entry to tp and mps in final treated water were sampled site no 5 to 8 the collected wet sediments 2 3 kg were oven dried binder germany ed 115 at 65 c for 36 h until constant dry mass 1 36 to 1 88 kg followed by wet sieving with mesh sieves 10 mm 5 mm 850 μm and 63 μm sarkar et al 2019 similarly the surface water contents were fractioned into two sections 63 850 µm and 850 µm 5 mm the bigger plastic particles 5 10 mm and 10 mm are separated by naked eye observation followed by counting and weighing mettler toledo switzerland newclassic ms model ms30002se a01 mps from the sieved sediment and water samples 850 µm 5 mm and 63 850 µm were separated following the density separation method using standard zncl2 solution 1 80 g cm 3 sarkar et al 2019 tien et al 2020 briefly saturated zncl2 thermo fisher scientific inc solution was added to the samples at the ratio 10 1 v w followed by stirring for 15 20 min and keeping suspensions undisturbed overnight the floating particles were separated using the siphoning technique and collected on filter paper glass microfibre filter pore size 0 7 μm over a buckner flask connected to a vacuum pump the accumulated floating debris was washed repeatedly with deionized water to remove traces of salt solution followed by digestion 1 3 w v with 30 hydrogen peroxide solution for 3 h until complete digestion of biological materials the remaining undigestable plastic debris was washed with deionized water repeatedly using vacuum filtration glass microfibre filter pore size 0 7 μm the density separation and digestion process were repeated for the second time until only plastic materials remain on the filter followed by drying in a vacuum desiccator for 36 h the filter was weighed before vacuum filtration to get precise plastic content in each fraction during all steps no plastic equipment was used and proper care was taken to prevent contamination with other mps 2 3 biological samples and mpsextraction biological samples were collected from test tp sites using experimental fishing using a cast net 10 15 mm mesh and stored with ice in a sealed container for further processing different species of major fin fishes viz labeo rohita l bata l catla oreochromis niloticus cirrhinus mrigala minor fin fishes viz chanda nama and puntius sophore and freshwater snails macroinvertebrates viz lymnaea acuminata and indoplanorbis exustus were collected the fishes were rinsed with distilled water and dissected to remove the entire gastrointestinal gi tract from esophagus to cloaca followed by complete digestion with 30 h2o2 at 70 c to degrade the remaining organic materials gbogbo et al 2020 in case of smaller fish species 10 g and snail the gi tract and entire body mass respectively were pooled together and digested as above the digested solution was then filtered for plastic examination however to understand the co contaminant correlation between heavy metals in mps and fish l rohita

learning algorithm r rtsne chen et al 2020a were performed to elucidate the relation between mps fraction collected from fishes with spatially variable mps fraction measured in the surface water and sediment of wwc and tp sites duncan multiple test range dmrt analysis was done in sas package to find the difference between heavy metal concentrations in sampled sediments water and mps regression analysis was performed to analyze the relationship between mean mps concentration with chemical indicators viz ph specific conductivity total n and total p tests were considered significant at p 0 05 chen et al 2020a 3 results 3 1 mps distribution in wwc and tp diverse types of mps 63 µm 5 mm were extracted from the sediments of wwc besides other macro 10 mm and mesoplastics 5 10 mm fractions fig 2 they are classified into various morphotypes film fibre fragments beads and foam and color types red yellow green blue grey white black and transparent fig 2 a depicts the optical microscope images of mps extracted from the sediments of site 1 fig 2 a 1 site 2 fig 2 a 2 site 3 fig 2 a 3 and site 4 fig 2 a 4 the number and weight percent of these morphocolor types are presented in fig 2 b 1 n and 1 w 2 n and 2 w 3 n and 3 w and 4 n and 4 w it can be observed that maximum variation in the number and weight distribution of morphocolor types are present in the 850 µm 5 mm size fractions and the 63 850 µm size fraction is majorly dominated by two morphocolor types viz transparent film 80 95 and multi color fibres 5 20 in the 850 µm 5 mm size fraction the biggest contribution came from fragments 74 followed by the transparent film 15 at site 1 transparent film 70 followed by red fragments 7 at site 2 white fibre 28 and blue fragments 27 8 followed by the transparent film 16 at site 3 and black fibre 76 followed by the transparent film 20 at site 4 a similar trend was observed in the weight distribution of different morphocolor types in the wwc sediment mps the mean concentration items g and mg kg of plastic litters including mps in the wwc sediments with different morphotypes is presented in table 1 indicating three times higher load of plastic litters with 5 mm size in the wwc sediments as compared to tp sediments ft ir analysis showed that pe polyethylene and pet polyethylene terephthalate are the dominant mps types 850 µm 5 mm in wwc sediment and the percentage of pe 37 50 was more than pet 31 45 fig s2 it is interesting to note that the surface water 0 40 cm of wwc mainly contained 63 850 µm mps with limited morphotypes film fibre and fragments and their number items l and weight mg l distribution is presented in the fig 2 c and d respectively in the wwc water the concentration of film fibre and fragments ranged between 0 0 to 11 23 2 94 items l 11 20 2 00 to 19 44 2 95 items l and 11 5 1 75 to 107 05 17 50 items l respectively percentage distribution of mps with varied morphocolor types in the surface water of wwcs is presented in fig s2 a fig 3 a depicts the optical microscope images of mps extracted from the tp sediments at site 5 fig 3 a 1 site 6 fig 3 a 2 site 7 fig 3 a 3 and site 8 fig 3 a 4 similar to wwc sediments the maximum variation in the number and weight distribution of morphocolor types is present in the 850 µm 5 mm size fractions however more variation was observed in the morphocolor types of 63 850 µm mps size fraction as compared to wwc sediments in the 850 µm 5 mm size fraction the maximum contribution came from translucent fragments 45 followed by the transparent film 36 at site 5 transparent film 73 followed by transparent fragments 11 at site 6 transparent fragments 53 followed by translucent fragments 43 at site 7 and transparent fragments 54 followed by translucent fragments 19 at site 8 in the 63 850 µm size fraction the biggest contribution came from transparent fragments 43 followed by translucent fragments 38 at site 5 translucent fragments 77 followed by transparent fragments 17 at site 6 translucent fragments 48 followed by transparent fragments 36 at site 7 and transparent fragments 36 and transparent film 36 followed by translucent fragments 28 at site 8 a similar trend was observed in the weight distribution of different morphocolor types in the tp sediment mps table 1 also shows that the bigger plastic litters 5 mm were nearly absent in the tp sediments however the mean concentration items kg and mg kg of mps in the tp sediments was comparable with wwc sediments it was observed that pe and pet were dominant mps 850 µm 5 mm in the tp sediments and the percentage of pet 34 81 was more than pe 12 61 fig s3 similar to wwc the surface water column 0 40 cm of tp mainly contained 63 850 µm mps with limited morphotypes film fibre and fragments and their number items l and weight mg l distribution is presented in the fig 3 c and d respectively in the pond water the concentration of film fibre and fragments ranged between 0 0 to1 9 0 45 items l 2 05 2 00 to 11 21 3 00 items l and 5 75 1 31 to 15 10 4 94 items l respectively this is to note that the mps content in the treated pond water was much lower than the wastewater canal the percentage distribution of mps with varied morphocolor types in the surface water of tps is presented in fig s2 b 3 2 mps in fishes and macroinvertebrates of tps fig 4 depicts microscopic images of the mps extracted from the gi tract and body mass of biological samples from tp sites it was observed that all the biological samples in the present study contained mps in the guts of fishes and the body mass of macroinvertebrates however the mps contamination by the 850 µm 5 mm size fraction is very low and maximum was done by the 63 850 µm size fractions the mps 850 µm 5 mm extracted from the fish samples were identified using atr ft ir and found that they belong to mainly pe and pet class of plastics the mps particle 850 µm 5 mm extracted from the l rohita gut belonged to pet with characteristics ir spectrum at 1714 cm 1 c o stretching vibration 1234 cm 1 c o stretching vibration 1016 cm 1 c o c stretching vibrations and 724 cm 1 aromatic c h out of plane bending fig 4 1 however mps particle 850 µm 5 mm extracted from the l bata showed major spectra of both pe 2940 cm 1 c h symmetric stretching vibration and 2855 cm 1 c h asymmetric stretching vibration and pet 1730 cm 1 c o stretching vibration 1221 cm 1 c o stretching vibration and 1101 cm 1 c o c stretching vibrations fig 4 2 the mps particles 850 µm 5 mm extracted from the identified macroinvertebrates l acuminata and i exustus belongs to pe with characteristics ir spectrum at 2916 2917 cm 1 c h asymmetric stretching vibration 2868 cm 1 c h symmetric stretching vibration and 1456 cm 1 c h bending vibration fig 4 3 and 4 since the mps content 63 850 µm is very low as compared to the sediment and water column the fish gut content was dyed with a fluorescent dye nr staining for better observation and counting of the mps fig 4 a to hdepicts the fluorescent microscope images of mps 63 850 µm extracted from fishes p sophore c nama c mrigala l bata o niloticus l rohita and macroinvertebrates l acuminata and i exustus the number distribution of mps at different size ranges 850 µm 5 mm and 63 850 µm and morphotypes extracted from fishes and macroinvertebrates are presented in table 2 it was observed that fragmented mps were dominated in the fish gut samples followed by fibre and film 3 3 statistical analysis of mps distribution fig 5 a shows the spatial segmentation of mps items kg of sediment number l of water and number per fish in the sampled sediment water and fish gut which followed the order wwc sediment tp sediment wwc water tpwater fish gut pca of the number distribution of mps in the sediment water and fish revealed that the three principal components encompassed a majority of variation 85 73 fig 5 b positive pc1 was correlated with the number distribution of mps in surface water of wwc and tp and fish guts whereas negative pc1 was correlated with the number distribution of mps in the tp sediments the number distribution of mps in wwc sediments were more correlated with the negative pc2 similarly pca of the weight distribution of mps mg kg of sediment mg l of water in the sediment and surface water of wwc and tp fig s4 revealed that the three principal components encompassed the majority of variation 63 29 the study also found that positive pc1 and negative pc1 were correlated with the weight distribution of mps in the surface water column and sediment of wwc and tp sites respectively machine learning algorithm t distributed stochastic neighbor embedding t sne cluster analysis perplexity 10 showed that number distribution of mps in the fish gut 5 fish 6 fish 7 fish and 8 fish was more associated with number distribution of mps in the surface water of tp 5 tp wat 6 tp wat 7 tp wat 8 tp wat fig 5 c number distribution of mps in tp sediment 5 tp sed 6 tp sed 7 tp sed 8 tp sed was found to be more associated with surface water of wwc sites 1 wwc wat 2 wwc wat 3 wwc wat 4 wwc wat fig 5 c it is interesting to note that two separate clusters exist between the number distribution of mps in wwc sediments and tp sites similarly t sne cluster analysis was done on the weight distribution of mps in sediment and surface water of wwc and tp sites fig s5 which revealed that mps content in surface water of wwc and tp was more associated t sne cluster analysis was also done on the number and weight distribution of different size fraction 10 mm 5 10 mm 850 µm 5 mm and 63 850 µm of plastics and mps with varied morphotypes film fibre fragments foam and beads to understand any relationship between the different morphotypes fig s6 it was observed that no definite cluster formed between size and morphotypes based on number distribution however based on weight distribution a strong association was observed between 5 10 mm film and 850 µm 5 mm film strongly indicating the origin of small sized films due to weathering of bigger plastic films in the wwc and tp network correlation statistics of number distribution of mps items kg of sediment and items l of water with chemical indicators viz ph specific conductivity µs cm total n mg l and total p mg l was conducted and depicted in fig 5 d it shows that no correlation exists between the ph and specific conductivity of water and sediment of wwc and tp sites p 0 05 however a significant correlation was observed between mps number distribution and total n content r2 0 87 p 0 0001 followed by total p r2 0 32 p 0 0253 similarly correlation statistics of weight distribution of mps mg kg of sediment and mg l of water with chemical indicators viz ph specific conductivity µs cm total n ppm and total p ppm was done however no correlation was found between these parameters with p 0 05 fig s7 3 4 heavy metal distribution and mps removal efficiency the heavy metal concentrations in the sediment surface water fish muscle and mps are presented in table 3 since wastewater is being treated through the system a high concentration of heavy metals was found in the test sediments 3 3 351 75 µg g mps also contained a high concentration of heavy metals on their surface 0 04 439 32 µg g as compared to water samples 0 13 345 59 µg l indicating their role as a potential vector in transporting the same due to the natural treatment process the apparent mean heavy metal concentrations were found reduced in the surface water of tp as compared to wwc however the values are not found with statistically significant differences except for zn and ni p value 0 0009 the concentration of heavy metals on the mps surface remained the same with statistically nonsignificant differences p value 0 2572 it was further revealed that cr cu ni pb and zn were heavily found on the mps surface among others the partition coefficient of heavy metals on mps surface from the water was estimated using the following equation selvam et al 2020 k m p w m e p m e w where mep indicates the metal concentration on the mps surface and mew indicates metal concentration in the water it was observed that the kmpwvalue in the tps was considerably high as compared to wwcs table 3 which might be due to the longer retention of mps particles in the tps further in the tps as and cr showed high kmpw values as compared to others the heavy metal content in the fish muscle l rohita collected from tps was estimated and it was found that a considerable amount 0 73 to 49 62 µg g of heavy metal exists in the muscle the concentration of heavy metal in fish muscle followed the order zn cu cr pb ni as cd table 3 the t sne cluster analysis of metal content in fish muscle mps water and sediment fig 6 a revealed that heavy metal content in fish muscle was more associated with the metal content of mps extracted from tps fig 6 b shows the mps level in the raw wastewater just before the entry to the tps and treated water at the outer channel the maximum mps level in the rawwater was found at site 8 followed by site 7 and site 6 site 5 however the maximum removal efficiency was found at site 6 with 73 efficiency followed by site 8 with 58 on average the mps removal efficiency by the tps was found to be 53 35 15 35 further it was observed that films were readily removed from the wastewater as compared to other morphotypes 4 disscussion 4 1 mps discharge to tps municipal discharge through sewage canals is reported to be highly polluted and caused significant contribution in aggravating mps pollution issues in the aquatic environment the influent of a sewage treatment plant stp in china was reported to contain mps at a concentration of 12 03 1 29 items l yang et al 2019 on average the influents of stp situated in various countries like germany finland sweden canada etc were reported to contain mps at 15 1 to 640 items l and the effluent contained no detectable to 65 items l kang et al 2018 a separate study further reported that the mps level in the sewage influents ranged from 1 item l to 7216 items l and the final effluent contains no detectable to 81 items l gatidou et al 2019 so it can be assessed that municipal wastewater carries a huge load of mps and in developed countries like usa germany etc the mps level in the final discharge effluent to natural stream is reduced through stp however this study for the first time delineates the issues of mps contamination of a natural wastewater treatment wetland system which is still a very common system for wastewater treatment in underdeveloped or developing countries like india this study implicates the wwc as an important source of mps to the tp it was revealed in the present study that a huge number of mps are distributed in the wwcs associated with ekw and our results demonstrated that wwcs are the key pathways for mps entry to tp of ekw previously wastewater treatment plant wwtp and stp effluent were reported as the main source of mps in the aquatic environment like in canada wastewater effluent to lake ontario contains 13 3 15 5 mps items l grbić et al 2020 in the present study on average the sediments and surface water of wwc contained mps 1108 78 to 34612 87 items kg and 30 46 to 137 72 items l respectively the mp concentration in the influents of stps was reported to be 15 1 items l in sweden magnusson and norén 2014 610 items l in finland talvitie et al 2015 0 4 to 3 2 items l in finland talvitie et al 2017 133 0 35 3 items l in the usa michielssen et al 2016 etc hence it can be assessed that the transport of mps through wwcs to ekw tps is comparable with the reported level of mps in the influents of stp or wwtp in other countries in the wwc sediments the maximum variation based on morphocolor types in mps distribution was present in the 850 µm 5 mm size fractions this could be due to a high percentage of less weathered multi colored plastic particles in the wwc liu et al 2020 the 63 850 µm size fraction was mainly dominated by transparent film and multi color fibres the dominance of fibres can be explained by the immediate release of textile fibres from domestic wastewater into these canals it was heavily reported that fibres are the dominant form of mps in domestic effluents which eventually contaminates the freshwater natural streams and marine environments dris et al 2016 hernandez et al 2017 the surface water of wwcs was predominantly contained mps in the size fraction of 63 850 µm similar results were reported from other countries where mps were tested for their presence in the influents of stp at the size range of 20 200 µm finland talvitie et al 2015 20 400 µm usa michielssen et al 2016 20 300 µm russia hidalgo ruz et al 2012 it was observed that the concentration of macro 10 mm and mesoplastics 5 10 mm in the wwc sediments is three times higher as compared to tp sediments however mps concentration 5mm in both wwc and tp sediments is comparable and in many cases the load of mps in tp sediments is higher than wwc sediments for example the number and mass concentration of film type of mps 850 µm 5 mm in the sediments of tp site 6 is higher 829 66 120 14 items kg and 149 94 63 46 mg kg than all the wwc sediments 34 67 7 03 to 236 85 54 41items kg and 15 01 9 06 to 72 92 44 43 mg kg this observation infers limited entry of bigger plastic particles litters in the tp through the wwc however the load of mps from the wwc gets deposited in the tp leading to a higher abundance of mps in the later this might be due to the presence of a physical screening barrier made of bamboo sticks between tp and wwc gupta et al 2016 which could reduce the entry of bigger plastics but may not be efficient enough to reduce the inflow of mps in the tp it is evident from fig 5 a that the number distribution of mps in the sediments of both wwc and tp were comparable but pca fig 5 b and fig s2 revealed a strong correlation between wwc and tp surface water mps which infers that floating or low density mps of wwc water is directly influencing the tp mps rather than the insitu mps load in the tp sediments pca analysis fig 5 b also revealed that the number distributions of mps in tp sediments were less associated with each other and also with the wwc sediments indicating differential mps loading process of individual tp by the wwc this differential mps loading of individual tp can be explained by different mps load of wwc or any other physical properties like flow rate physical distance etc pca was also done to describe the distribution of mps in different locations of the wei river of china where it was found that fibre mps are associated more with surface water ding et al 2019 previously pca was used in many studies to establish the correlation between mps abundance with various environmental parameters sarkar et al 2019 chen et al 2020a a study in the huangpu river and its tributary suzhou creek in shanghai megacity revealed that mps concentration was highly associated with total soluble solid tss and humic chen et al 2020a in the ganga river it was established by the pca that mps abundance is more correlated with specific conductivity and available phosphate content of the sediments sarkar et al 2019 regression analysis of mps fig 5 d distribution with chemical indicators ph specific conductivity total n and total p indicates that it was poorly correlated with ph and specific conductivity however a strong regression coefficient p value 0 0001 was found with total n which indicates that besides total p association exists between mps abundance and total n in the aquatic bodies an assessment of the river environment in japan also found a strong correlation between mps concentration with total n content of water kataoka et al 2019 however an inverse correlation was reported in wwtps where influents with high total n and low mps concentration decreased to effluent with high mps and less total n bayo et al 2020 it was also reported that mps associated biofilms could alter the nitrogen and phosphorous cycling process of the aquatic system chen et al 2020b cluster analysis through t sne fig 5 c and fig s4 also revealed a strong association between mps distribution in surface water of wwc and tp sites further t sne analysis fig s5 revealed that weight distribution of 63 850 µm mps varied from other size fractions indicating a possible differential occurrence of this fine mps fraction which might be directly originated from the domestic source rather than in situ weathering at the wwc or tp site from bigger mps fraction 850 µm 5 mm however the same study also revealed a strong association between 5 10 mm film and 850 µm 5 mm film indicating the origin of small sized films though in situ weathering of bigger plastic films at wwc and tp sites previously the t sne machine learning algorithm was used for cluster analysis of morphological characteristics and polymer compositions of mps which showed that reservoir samples were significantly different from the river and creek samples chen et al 2020a t sne was also used to visualize the non linear relationship between nir spectra and corresponding information on plastic pollution on soil samples qui et al 2020 4 2 mps contamination in fishes and macroinvertebrates natural wastewater treatment wetland system like ekw is also celebrated for converting waste to wealth through successfully commercial fish cultivation in the tps sarkar et al 2009 gupta et al 2016 since wastewater is influent to the tp mps contamination in the major aquatic biota of tp is also investigated in the present study it was previously reported that due to the tiny size of micro and nanoplastics they are bioavailable across the trophic food chain free et al 2014 the ingestion scenario is more clear among marine biota viz invertebrates goldstein and goodwin 2013 fish davison and asch 2011 seabirds ryan et al 2009 and mammals fossi et al 2014 imposing reduced feeding energy storage and other ecophysiological disorders due to physical injury physiological stress and false satiation in their body as per organismal studies of mps in freshwater resources of europe north america and asia it is evident that freshwater fauna is equally impacted by the ingestion of mps at different trophic guild eerkes medrano et al 2015 moreover freshwaters are highly acceptable for human consumption and drinking purposes which creates concerns surrounding human ingestion of mps therefore to fulfill the limited understanding of the mps impact on the freshwater ecosystem it is of paramount importance to strengthen the database on the distribution of tiny plastics debris at each trophic niche t sne cluster analysis revealed that the number distribution of mps in the fish gut was more associated with the number distribution of mps in the surface water of tp and wwc sites fig 5 b thus it can be inferred that the level of mp contamination in fin fishes is mainly due to low density or floating mps content of the tp water which is fed by the wwc it was reported that planktivores filter feeders and suspension feeders inhabiting in the upper column of the aquatic ecosystem prefer low density pe specific gravity 0 91 0 94 wright et al 2013 on the contrary high density plastics like pvc poly vinyl chloride density 1 38 are more likely to deposit as benthic suspension and make available for detritivores and benthic organisms in the present study pet was detected in the gut of omnivorous column feeder l rohita and pe pet in l bata from tp site 6 small fishes like eastern mosquito fish gambusia holbrooki were considered as a model species for ecotoxicological and environmental monitoring studies and this fish species was studied recently for biomonitoring of mps in the natural freshwater habitats of the greater melbourne area su et al 2019 thus the present study also deliberated to understand the contamination level of mps in the locally available indigenous small fishes viz c nama and p sophore a larger abundance of fragments and fibrous mps 63 850 µm was found in the gut content of c nama and p sophore at tp site 7 the color of ingested particles plays a pivotal role in getting engulfed by the larger predator organisms besseling et al 2014 similarly colored plastic particles have a greater tendency to be observed in the food chain at the next level da costa et al 2016 it was evident from the previous study that few colored plastics such as tan and yellow particles resembling zooplankton are preferred by many fishes and their larvae as food shaw and day 1994 recently a study encountered that white plastic particles are present in more than 5 of oceanic fishes in the north sea and baltic sea rummel et al 2016 similarly in the present study white light yellow or green colored plastic particles were found in the guts or body mass of fishes and test macroinvertebrates macroinvertebrates were reported to bioaccumulate high concentrations of mps for example edible freshwater shellfish asian clam corbicula fluminea from freshwater lake taihu china su et al 2016 filter feeding marine bivalves scapharca cornea from setiu wetland malaysia is also reported to engulf pe and polyamide type filaments ibrahim et al 2016 due to abandoned fishing gear and nets the study is corroborated with the present findings where microfibres 63 850 µm were found in the gut of freshwater macroinvertebrates l acuminata and i exustus table 2 fig 4 4 and g h in tp site 5 macroinvertebrates are also suggested as bioindicators for mps pollution in the freshwater sediments due to their high mps accumulation capacity su et al 2018 4 3 mps as heavy metal vector mps have been reported as a vector for transporting toxic pollutants viz pop heavy metals etc in the aquatic ecosystem guo and wang 2020 tang et al 2020 and reported to cause hazardous effects to aquatic biota brennecke et al 2016 mintenig et al 2020 however the report on the co occurrence of mps as a vector of heavy metal is scanty especially from the freshwater wetland ecosystem of india previously mps have been reported as a vector of heavy metals as cu cd cr pb mn and zn in the groundwater and surface water of coastal south india selvam et al 2020 the present study also shows that mps extracted from the wwcs and tps are heavily loaded with heavy metals viz as cd cr cu ni pb and zn however the partition coefficient of these heavy metals on mps surface varied based on the type of metals and water system viz canals wwc and ponds tp in the tps the partition coefficient was found to be higher as compared to wwc which might be due to retention of mps for a longer duration and aging of mps in the system vedolin et al 2018 it was previously reported that the adsorption of heavy metals on the mps surfaces increased due to an increase in the retention time brennecke et al 2016 further t sne cluster analysis discovered that heavy metal abundance in the fish muscle was associated with the heavy metal content of the mps extracted from tps this fact enumerates that mps are acting as possible heavy metals carriers thus contaminating fish in the previous section it was discussed that colored mps pe and pet are readily ingested by the fish species and these plastic chemical types are reported to have good heavy metal adsorption capacity selvam et al 2020 pb cr and zn were reported to have higher adsorption tendencies on the pe surfaces godoy et al 2019 it was reported that heavy metals can also easily adsorbed on the suspended particulate matter spm due to its high surface area and reactivity liu et al 2016 the spm partition coefficients of as cd cu pb and zn were ranged from 4 09 6 20 in the bejian river system li et al 2018 however heavy metals were reported to have a high tendency to adsorb on the mps with a higher partition coefficient for example heavy metals as cd cr cu pb mn and zn showed high mps partition coefficient values 0 23 25 36 in groundwater selvam et al 2020 the study corroborated with the present finding with high mps partition coefficient kpw values 2 28 23 50 4 4 mps removal efficiency wwtps are reported to be an important source of mps in the aquatic ecosystems and their efficiencies in the removing mps were evaluated in many countries magnusson and norén 2014 dris et al 2015 michielssen et al 2016 grbić et al 2020 however until now there is no such study in the natural wastewater treatment wetland system thus in the present study mps were estimated at the entry and outer channel of the tps to evaluate its mps removal efficiency the mps removal efficiency of the wastewater treatment wetland system was found to be around 50 which is very much lower than other treatment systems with advanced technologies wwtp in france was reported to remove 84 94 of fibrous mps through primary and biological treatment dris et al 2015 wwtp in china was reported to remove 97 67 98 46 microplastics through primary secondary and tertiary treatment processes yuan et al 2020 the average microplastics removal efficiency of wwtps with tertiary treatment shows more than 97 removal efficiency sun et al 2019 however the removal efficiency of the present natural wetland system was found to be comparable with few studies like 43 in wwtp with primary and secondary treatment processes in china ding et al 2020 48 73 in wwtp with secondary and tertiary treatment process in turkey akarsu et al 2020 and 53 33 in wwtp with mechanical chemical and biological treatment processes in sweden ziajahromi et al 2016 in the present study it was also found that microplastics films 80 9 were better removed by the treatment process as compared to the fibres 67 91 and fragments 41 23 however a previous study reports that fibres are easily removed by advanced wwtp with preliminary and primary treatment process due to easily entrapped in the flocculating particles and separation by sedimentation talvitie et al 2015 ziajahromi et al 2016 fragments are reported to remain after primary treatment and due to neutral buoyancy they can be removed only through the secondary treatment process sun et al 2019 it was envisaged that the mps removal efficiency of the present wetland system can be improved further by the installation of an efficient filter system in the inlet point between wwc and tp sites for screening mps so that mps could not enter into the tps previously it was reported that membrane bioreactors can remove 99 9 mps followed by sand filter 97 mps dissolved air flotation 95 mps and disc filter 40 98 5 mps during the wastewater treatment process talvitie et al 2017 previous study also have examined aluminum al and iron fe based salts for pe microplastics removal in water treatment process through coagulation followed by ultrafiltration ma et al 2019 5 conclusion the present study is the first to provide insights on the role of wastewater canals in mediating mps transportation to east kolkata wetland a natural wastewater treatment wetland system ultimately providing cognizance on mps contamination of ecologically important wetland systems the present finding also contributes in filling the knowledge gap on the occurrence fate and removal of mps in the natural wastewater treatment wetland system the key findings are 1 because of wastewater sources wwc the natural wetland system are being heavily contaminated with mps 2 the macro and mesoplastics load was higher 3 times in the wwcs sediments as compared to individual tps where the load of mps 850 µm to 5 mm was higher 2 5 times 3 natural biota freshwater macroinvertebrates and finfishes of the tps were found contaminated with mps 4 mps contamination in tps fishes were found positively correlated with surface water mps than the sediment mps 5 wastewater and mps were carrying a large amount of toxic heavy metals 1 03 345 6 µg l and 2 03 191 01 µg g respectively 6 tps fishes were also found co contaminated with toxic heavy metals through bioconcentration and biomagnifications besides possible ingestion of metal loaded mps 7 the natural wastewater treatment process was found to remove mps with a removal efficiency of around 50 the study indicates that the ecologically diverse natural wetland system is facing the risk of mps pollution and like other ecologically important contaminants it has reached all the trophic state hampering and stressing the biological integrity of the wetland system finally the study emphasizes the attention needed to be given to reduce various ecological stresses caused by mps pollution in the natural wetland system through the implementation of environmental management measures to maintain its sustainability and ecosystem

17198,reverse osmosis ro is a widely applied technique for wastewater effluent reuse and landfill leachate treatment the latter generates a refractory ro leachate concentrate rolc for which cost effective treatment is required this study focuses on a two step electrochemical method consisting of aluminum based electrocoagulation ec and simultaneous electrooxidation electrocoagulation with a titanium based lead dioxide ti ß pbo2 anode and aluminum cathode eoec assembly the sequence and electrode arrangements of the combined electrochemical process were investigated to determine the organic transformation ti ß pbo2 anode viability and energy consumption series based ec eoec decreased the total chemical oxygen demand cod from 8750 mg l 1 to 380 mg l 1 a 96 removal efficiency in 3 5 hours at 141 a m 2 under a low energy consumption of 28 7 kwh kgcod 1 the rolc biodegradability bod5 cod significantly increased from 0 015 to 0 530 which was ascribed to aromatic removal e g c c and an increase in cooh functional groups furthermore the rapid removal of natural organic matter and increase in ph elevation from ec suppressed the dissolution of pb from the ti ß pbo2 anode during the subsequent eoec thereby leaving 0 061 mg l 1 in the rolc after treatment the treatment cost was 3 86 usd kgcod 1 which was approximately 34 lower than that of previously reported electrochemical

tonnes by 2025 thereby making the leachate treatment a prominent challenge worldwide abunama et al 2018 costa et al 2019 membrane technologies such as reverse osmosis ro have been adopted in more than 20 of landfill leachate treatment plants worldwide to fulfill stringent discharge standards e g rejection rates 98 99 for ro renou et al 2008a šír et al 2012 cingolani et al 2018 however such technologies inevitably form ro leachate concentrate rolc an undesirable by product that contains recalcitrant organics such as humic and fulvic acids inorganics and heavy metals shah et al 2017 at concentrations up to 20 times the original feed zhou et al 2011 the less biodegradable i e biochemical oxygen demand bod5 chemical oxygen demand cod 0 1 and refractory characteristics of rolc create a costly and challenging problem chen et al 2019a the current treatment methods for rolc are typically categorized into four divisions namely i recirculation to landfill sites ii solidification stabilization e g fly ash and reactivated gypsum iii evaporation distillation and iv advanced oxidation processes aops such as ozonation and fenton oxidation wang et al 2016 however owing to the harsh constituents of rolc recirculation to landfill sites restrains microbial activity for degradation thereby threatening further biological treatment processes for landfill leachate the ro system also suffers from excessive humic fouling and weaker permeating flow rates when reprocessing the recirculated leachate renou et al 2008b however solidification stabilization on the other hand requires costly hydraulic binders such as cement and fly ash which are equivalent to 34 usd t 1 and 93 usd t 1 of treated rolc respectively hendrych et al 2019 the evaporation distillation process includes mechanical vapor recompression mvr and submerged combustion evaporation sce as potential options however humic substances cause mineral scaling in mvr ye et al 2017 whereas sce produces residue without guaranteeing ammonia removal zhang et al 2019 in contrast aops degrade rolc at the expense of the continuous addition of chemical reagents e g hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid for oxidation and ph control wang et al 2019 an alternative to rolc treatment is the in situ formation of coagulants and oxidants through electrochemical processes such as electrocoagulation ec and electrooxidation eo ec and eo have been shown to respectively remove 70 and 88 of cod in rolc within 6 h of treatment zhou et al 2016 fernandes et al 2019 särkkä et al 2015 elucidated the benefits of al based ec over alum dosing in which larger and more resistant flocs are produced the aluminum hydroxide al oh 3 generated during ec has a strong adsorption affinity for humic acids which are abundant in rolc jin et al 2018 however eo with materials such as titanium based lead dioxide ti ß pbo2 generates oxidative reagents notably active chlorine and free radicals e g oh owing to high oxygen overpotentials 1 9 v vs standard hydrogen electrode the ti ß pbo2 anode is also more stable than ti sno2 and is less costly than boron doped diamonds si bdd thereby making it a strong candidate for rolc degradation panizza and cerisola 2009 however the toxic leaching of pb ii ions dissuades the use of ti ß pbo2 anodes gurung et al 2018 moreover individual electrochemical processes are additionally incapable of rapidly eliminating pollutants without severe energy expenditures deng et al 2020 combined electrochemical processes ceps that strategically merge ec and eo may overcome the abovementioned key challenges by conducting ec with aluminum the initial organic load consisting of humic acids can be significantly reduced the efficiency and duration of the subsequent eo step can be improved by the prior removal of refractory compounds via ec additionally the amphoteric property of aluminum permits ec to be implemented during eo as eoec benhadji et al 2011 the design of eoec in which aluminum serves as the cathode can also limit the dissolution of pb ii ions from ti ß pbo2 anodes the reduction of the pbo2 coating by water is favorable below a ph of 7 2 lin and valentine 2010 whereas rolc has an alkaline nature with a ph of 7 9 and 8 2 therefore the consumption of alkalinity or the presence of other reductants such as natural organic matter nom may instigate the dissolution of pb ii lin and valentine 2009 fernandes et al 2017 to avert this phenomenon aluminum based ec could be strategically implemented before or during eo ti ß pbo2 anode and al cathode to raise the ph and remove nom while maintaining a high treatment efficacy in this study a two step electrochemical process integrating ec and eoec was developed for rolc treatment the cep sequence ec or eoec as the first step and electrode arrangements monopolar parallel or series were investigated in terms of the changes in cod total organic carbon toc specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 and color reduction furthermore the cep mechanism biodegradability ti ß pbo2 anode viability and cost were analyzed and discussed it is expected that by optimizing the cep significant rolc degradation and biodegradability enhancements can be attained while effectively preserving the ti ß pbo2 anode 2 materials and methods 2 1 leachate source the landfill leachate concentrate processed from disc tube ro was obtained from the xiaping solid waste landfill in shenzhen china the characteristics of the rolc are presented in table 1 2 2 electrochemical configuration all of the electrochemical tests were performed in undivided cells fig 1 as a two step process the electrode arrangements were all monopolar and designed as follows a parallel ec eoec p1 b series ec eoec s1 c parallel eoec ec p2 and d series eoec ec s2 the rolc was unfiltered when transferring the effluent to the subsequent treatment step as the cod toc and sludge volume index svi were found to decrease text si 1 and fig si 1 each run consisted of 300 ml of rolc without ph modification or chemical addition a constant stirring speed of 150 rpm was maintained throughout the experiments in ec eoec the ec phase consisted of four plates with 10 mm gaps which were intercalated as two aluminum anodes and two carbon graphite cathodes both of 99 9 purity 70 100 mm the total active surface area was determined to be 126 cm2 the current density was 141 a m 2 for 30 min under uniform current distribution which was deemed optimal from preliminary testing the eoec phase was designed with four intercalated plates of two ti ß pbo2 mesh anodes 70 100 mm 1 3 mm coating thickness and two aluminum cathodes eoec was executed for 180 min and the active surface area current density and interelectrode spacing were identical to those in the ec setup for eoec ec the treatment order was reversed when adjusting the arrangement from parallel to series the current density was maintained for the control without cathodic dissolution a titanium cathode was utilized of the same dimension was utilized the anodes and cathodes were exchanged after each run 2 3 analytical methods throughout the experiment samples were respectively taken

uv absorbance suva254 for each subsample was measured at 254 nm by obtaining the uv absorption coefficient cm 1 against the toc concentration of the corresponding sample the wavelengths at 203 nm and

verify the pb ii dissolution from the treatments the generated sludge was also acidified to verify the pb concentration all of the samples were measured after acidification with 5 nitric acid the untreated rolc and electrochemically treated samples were freeze dried for 48 h at 50 c and ground homogeneously into powder form high resolution x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analyses were conducted on a kratos analytical axis ultra dld photoelectron spectrometer the lyophilized samples were mixed with kbr at a 1 100 ratio and analyzed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir

analytical grade and were utilized as received without further purification 3 results and discussion 3 1 roles of sequence and arrangement all of the electrode arrangements i e s1 series ec eoec s2 series eoec ec p1 parallel ec eoec and p2 parallel eoec ec rapidly reduced the cod over 210 min following the pseudo first order kinetics and the order of effectiveness was s1 s2 p1 p2 table 2 the optimal arrangement was s1 which achieved 95 7 4 1 cod reduction at an averaged removal rate constant of 1 479 10 2 min 1 comparatively inverting the sequence by starting with eoec i e s2 reduced the cod removal rate by 1 41 times kobs 1 052 10 2 min 1 thereby resulting in a 91 7 6 4 cod removal fig 2 a furthermore the instantaneous current efficiencies ice in s1 and s2 yielded the highest peaks of 236 6 and 265 4 respectively compared with those to p1 136 6 and p2 138 9 see fig 2b and text si 2 thereby indicating that greater quantities of oxidants and coagulants are present for cod removal in series arrangements ahmed basha et al 2010 the ices of ec in p1 123 1 and s1 172 8 were much higher than those in p2 10 9 and s2 30 7 table si 1 indicating a superior current utilization efficiency when ec was arranged before eoec significant cod reductions were accompanied by near 100 decolorization and enhanced toc removal as displayed in fig 2c compared with the cod reduction rates the decolorization rates also followed the pseudo first order kinetics and the order of effectiveness was maintained as s1 s2 p1 p2 table 2 s1 achieved 99 2 0 6 color removal in 150 min with the highest averaged decolorization rate of 2 681 10 2 min 1 whereas the decolorization constants of s2 p1 and p2 were respectively 1 12 1 36 and 23 9 times lower respectively i e 2 403 10 2 1 977 10 2 and 1 12 10 3 min 1 despite the significant cod removal and decolorization in s1 a toc reduction of only 72 4 1 was achieved fig 2d the other electrode arrangements reduced the toc by 61 5 s2 63 5 p1 and 38 4 p2 in evaluating the characteristics of the removed toc fig 2e reveals that suva254 progression is an indicator of aromaticity in both series arrangements the suva254 reductions were superior s1 64 6 5 2 s2 67 4 5 8 to their parallel counterparts p1 55 9 6 7 p2 46 8 5 7 specifically p1 increased the suva254 during ec 0 min to 30 min thereby suggesting the removal of carbonaceous compounds without aromatic properties i e aliphatics however the ec in s1 removed aromatic compounds which was indicated by an increase and decrease in suva254 from 0 min to 30 min the suva254 discrepancy between p1 and s1 during ec might have been attributed to the quantity of aluminum dissolved as depicted in fig 2f during the ec of s1 the dissolution constant was 1 85 times higher than that of p1 at 1 538 10 2 g min 1 which provided 84 1 4 3 more dissolved aluminum see table si 2 and text si 3 the greater dissolution of aluminum induced by series arrangements may lead to the agglomeration of al oh 3 into a sweep floc thereby capturing uv quenching substances cañizares et al 2005 although s1 yielded the greatest cod toc and color removal the total aluminum dissolution from s2 was the highest among the ceps s2 s1 p1 p2 thereby indicating that increased aluminum dissolution does not correlate to better performance this can be explained by the ph evolution during treatment fig si 3 the increase in ph toward a threshold value of 10 in s1 and s2 attained an equilibrium of al oh 3 al oh 4 which might have lowered the ec efficiency jiménez et al 2012 although this hypothesis may explain the underperformance of ec near the end of the treatment for p2 and s2 further investigation is required to determine the cathodic ec efficiency in eoec the aluminum dissolution rates were analyzed to investigate the difference in ec efficiency between the parallel and series arrangements according to faraday s law text si 3 a constant of 9 95 10 3 g min 1 was determined as the theoretical dissolution rate with time as the sole variable song et al 2017 series arrangements invoked higher dissolution rates than the theoretical value owing to a larger potential difference solak et al 2009 as a side reaction from the water reduction hydroxide ions accumulated near the cathode and chemically attacked the solid aluminum to generate more al oh 3 linares hernández et al 2009 furthermore in increasing concentrations humic acid can chemisorb to aluminum pits thereby reducing the current density output mechelhoff et al 2013 because ec in series arrangements rapidly removes aromatic compounds e g humic substances as supported by the decrease in suva254 fig 2e this generates a positive feedback loop to sustain the current density throughout treatment in addition p1 and s1 yielded similar toc removals with substantial discrepancies in the suva254 reduction trends figs 2d and 2e whereas p1 adsorbed more aliphatic chains s1 subsequently reflected aromatic compounds removal this indicated an aluminum dissolution threshold in which charge neutralization alters to the formation of sweep flocs and aids facilitates the removal of aromatic compounds cañizares et al 2005 3 2 eoec insight with a chloride surrogate using chloride as a surrogate the dominant mechanism during eoec for each cep was investigated by comparing the chloride to cod ratio as shown in fig 3 a the eo of rolc was performed with an inert cathode i e titanium as the control thereby revealing a high correlation between the chloride consumed and the degraded cod r2 0 9604 during all of the experiments the chloride concentration during ec was found to be stable having oscillated by 3 8 suggesting that the cathodic ec acts as an interference i e only anodic eo degrades the cod with chloride consumption therefore when incorporating the aluminum cathode as shown in figs 3b and 3c the linear regression between cod and chloride decreased in the order of s1 0 8821 p1 0 7065 s2 0 6361 p2 0 5341 the decrease in the linear correlation implied a higher contribution from the cathodic ec because the al oh 3 removed cod without affecting the chloride concentrations the linear correlation of p1 and s1 was observed to be larger than that of p2 and s2 which was presumably due to the performance of ec prior to eoec thereby weakening the subsequent cathodic ec to confirm the contributions of anodic oxidation and cathodic adsorption to removal efficiency in eoec cod and carbon balances were performed table si 3 the analysis estimated that s2 yielded the highest mineralization rate of 35 8 whereas the other arrangements reflected lower efficiencies in s1 22 0 p1 9 7 and p2 3 6 furthermore less cathodic ec adsorption of cod occurred in p1 and s1 21 1 and 14 1 respectively than in p2 and s2 32 4 and 41 4 respectively thereby mirroring the linear regression analysis the cod balance additionally revealed that s1 achieved the highest cod removal efficiency owing to the initial ec step whereas s2 mineralized and adsorbed more pollutants than s1 during eoec series arrangements induce higher cell voltages mollah et al 2004 the increased hydrolysis during eoec prevents the accumulation of oxidized by products on the anode surface thereby increasing the anodic efficiency martínez huitle and brillas 2009 theoretically ti ß pbo2 anodes possess a wide anodic potential window of 1 5 v to 1 8 v vs ag agcl and are capable of both direct and indirect oxidation via physisorbed hydroxyl radicals oh and reactive chlorine species rcs panizza and martinez huitle 2013 aquino et al 2014 under alkaline conditions ph 7 45 chloride oxidation generates hypochlorite ions ocl as follows eqs 1 3 1 2 c l c l 2 2 e 2 c l 2 h 2 o hclo h c l 3 hclo h oc l 4 c l c l ads e 5 c l c l ads cl 2 e 6 c l oc l oc l c l 7 hco 3 o h co 3 h 2 o 8 co 3 oc l oc l co 3 2 although ti ß pbo2 anodes can also generate adsorbed chlorine radicals cl cl and ocl rapidly scavenge cl to respectively form cl2 k 8 5 109 m 1 s 1 and ocl k 8 3 109 m 1 s 1 eqs 5 6 guo et al 2017 in addition ocl can be formed indirectly via optimal concentrations of hco3 10 mm and cl 60 mm which are present in rolc eqs 7 8 zheng et al 2020 however as ocl is selective toward methoxy based aromatics guo et al 2017 the degradation effectiveness is insignificant in ec eoec p1 and s1 and short lived in eoec ec p2 and s2 alternatively cl can directly degrade oxygenated functional groups in aromatic structures through single electron transfers varanasi et al 2018 park et al 2009 contended that cl2 is the dominant oxidant in high salinity solutions and that the reaction toward aromatic compounds governs oxidation rate constants up to 5 orders of magnitudes greater than that of ocl i e 109 m 1 s 1 vs 104 m 1 s 1 therefore cl2 cl ocl physisorbed oh were presumed to be the chief generated oxidants in all of the ceps however the effect of cl2 may be lower in p1 and s1 than in p2 and s2 owing to the reduced aromaticity after ec as the chloride concentration decreased over time the favorability of cl may increase near the end of treatment 3 3 organic transformation and biodegradability chloride ions are consumed in proportion to the oxidation of the organic load via the formation of chlorine based oxidants fernandes et al 2016 this was validated by comparing the carbonaceous average oxidation state aos text si 4 to the present chloride concentration of each configuration fig 4 in p1 and s1 the aos respectively decreased from 5 79 to 8 29 and 7 34 respectively during the ec phase owing to the rapid uptake of toc subsequently the aos continuously increased to 1 63 and 2 48 respectively furthermore inversing the treatment sequence to p2 and s2 elevated the aos to 3 42 and 1 88 respectively parallel arrangements i e p1 and p2 could not drive the carbonaceous aos of rolc beyond zero the functional groups of the untreated and oxidized rolc were identified fig si 4 and compared to the aromatic substitution index uv253 uv203 and biodegradability bod5 cod six major functional groups were profiled as intermolecular o h stretching 3388 cm 1 c o 1641 cm 1 c c 1590 cm 1 cooh 1430 cm 1 c c shoulder 1135 cm 1 and c oh stretching vibrations 1035 cm 1 as a qualitative complement to the ft ir peaks xps measurements were conducted fig si 5 the total peak area of each deconvoluted c 1s spectrum was fractionated to specify each of the identified carbon peaks fig 5 accordingly the peaks found at 284 9 0 1 286 5 0 2 288 3 0 3 and 289 3 0 2 ev were associated with aliphatic aromatic carbon c c c c c oh amide i c o and carboxylates cooh respectively in addition the uv253 uv203 ratio reflected the presence of aromatic functional groups higher values indicated carbonyl and ester groups whereas smaller values were attributed to aliphatic chains iskander et al 2018 series based ceps s1 and s2 lowered the amount of c oh and c o as amide i and significantly increased the amount of cooh specifically the highest contents of cooh were present in s1 and s2 at 28 and 22 respectively compared with 11 in the untreated control fig 5a in addition the ceps in the series arrangements reduced the c o content from 10 control to 6 s1 and 8 s2 whereas the arrangements in parallel increased the content to 16 and 18 in p1 and p2 respectively furthermore the c oh content decreased to 14 in series arrangements whereas it increased to 25 in p2 under the xps analyses the peaks near 284 6 ev represented both aliphatic chains c c and sp2 hybridized non oxygenated aromatic rings c c c c leung et al 1992 rong et al 2015 therefore the degradation of c c into c c could not be detected via xps analysis as shown by the approximately 3 5 variation in all of the ceps after treatment fig 5a however the ft ir results demonstrated a significant reduction at 1590 cm 1 in s1 and s2 thereby confirming the degradation of the c c bonds fig si 4 moreover the biodegradability in the series arrangements was superior to that in the parallel arrangements s1 and s2 both transformed the rolc into a highly biodegradable effluent thereby significantly boosting the bod5 cod ratio from 0 015 to 0 529 and 0 640 respectively whereas the ratios of p1 and p2 remained at 0 095 and 0 035 respectively the aromatic substitution indexes uv253 uv203 of p1 s1 and s2 were reduced from 0 42 in the untreated rolc to 0 14 0 14 and 0 12 respectively whereas that of p2 decreased to 0 28 fig 5b therefore lower aromatic substitution indexes are not correlated with high biodegradability but may enable aromatic degradation for the treated rolc to be amenable to biological treatment recalcitrant compounds such as humic substances must be degraded or removed beforehand the refractory nature of humic substances possesses strong correlations with long chain hydrocarbons and aromaticity i e c c and c c zhang et al 2013 chen et al 2019b which are often reflected at wavenumbers of 1135 and 1590 cm 1 to 1640 cm 1 in ft ir spectroscopy qi et al 2018 deng et al 2019 although aliphatic hydrocarbons c c and oxidized intermediates are resistant to ocl and cl attack rajkumar et al 2005 rajkumar et al 2007 varanasi et al 2018 smaller aromatic constituents are swiftly degraded by cl2 and ocl park et al 2009 jing et al 2019 this explains the higher mineralization rate in s2 than in s1 as more aromatic compounds are present when performing eoec before ec the generated rcs attacks oxygen bound substitutions in aromatic rings thereby leading to a decrease in c o and an increase in c o functional groups jing et al 2019 however the decrease in c o in s1 and s2 was attributed to high adsorption from cathodic ec furthermore the decreases in c oh groups detected in s1 and s2 were generally tied to c o stretching and phenoxy structures chen et al 2015 the destruction of these substituents c oh enables the opening of phenolic constituents for enhanced degradation comninellis 1994 as such the degradation of rolc generated many oxidized intermediates which can be estimated by the cod toc ratios table si 4 for example s1 yielded the lowest ratio of approximately 0 38 thereby indicating the presence of more oxidized carbonaceous compounds with states of 3 such as carboxylic acids saroj et al 2005 this is supported by fig 5a which illustrates a significant increase in cooh and by the evolution of aos as shown in fig 4 generally low aos values of 4 signify unoxidized carbon such as methane whereas high aos values of 4 resemble heavily oxidized carbonaceous compounds such as carbon dioxide the analysis predicted an aos value of 5 79 for the untreated rolc thereby indicating an abundance of electron rich groups such as amines de vera et al 2017 as shown in fig si 6 p2 accounted for the least variance in oxidation state shifts whereas s1 and s2 yielded carbonaceous oxidation states of approximately 2 after 210 min 20 8 ah l 1 of charge passed although increases in the oxidation states also warrants concern regarding the formation of disinfection by products dbps further discussed in text si 4 cathodic ec may be capable of strongly adsorbing dbp precursors owing to their negative charges ghernaout et al 2009 future studies should be conducted to determine whether the order and configuration of the electrochemical setups can influence the formation of dbps 3 4 pb ii dissolution the use of ti ß pbo2 anodes is impeded by the dissolution of pb ii the dissolution pathway is conditional and suppressed by increasing ph lin and valentine 2010 dissolved inorganic carbon dic wang et al 2010 and free chlorine wang et al 2013 but accelerated by nom lin and valentine 2009 therefore for a comprehensive investigation the anodic pb dissolution pb concentrations in the raw and cep treated samples abovementioned factors and the generated sludge containing pb were analyzed table 3 ceps were the primary focus in series arrangements owing to their highest performances the data for parallel arrangements can be compared in table si 5 during s1 ec first removed the preexisting pb to undetectable levels adsorbing 0 078 mg of pb into the sludge thereafter eoec released approximately 0 042 mg of pb the cathodic ec adsorbed 0 103 mg of pb while 0 061 mg l 1 was not removed however s2 released around 2 2 times more pb approximately 0 092 mg and transferred 0 140 mg of pb into the sludge while 0 106 mg l 1 remained in the solution the subsequent ec was ineffective for pb removal by comparing s1 and s2 eoec in s1 generated 514 8 to 783 6 mg l 1 of dic but removed 876 8 703 8 mg l 1 in s2 the initial concentration of nom before running eoec was approximately 66 5 greater in s2 from 3576 mg l 1 than that in s1 from 2148 mg l 1 owing to the treatment sequence the reductive effect of nom may be greater than that of dic in shifting the favorability of pb ii dissolution furthermore the ceps in the parallel arrangements respectively released 0 245 mg and 0 325 mg of pb ii in p1 and p2 respectively which were 5 7 and 3 5 times greater than those of their respective series based counterparts although s2 provided excellent rolc treatment s1 was shown to be the only cep to sufficiently deter pb ii release pb ii leaching is generally controlled by modifying the ti ß pbo2 electrode via rare earth metal doping techniques or inclusion of inter layers zhao et al 2014 our study is the first attempt to electrochemically promote unfavorable conditions for pb ii dissolution previous studies have shown that pb dissolution is catalyzed under reductive constituents such as natural organic matter nom and is decelerated in neutral to alkaline ph conditions lin and valentine 2009 lin and valentine 2010 furthermore as little as 1 mg free cl2 l 1 can oxidize pb ii back into the pbo2 electrode coating wang et al 2013 and the oxidation can be accelerated if dic is present wang et al 2010 although both s1 and s2 surpassed the required free chlorine threshold the lower concentration in s1 might have been attributed to the consumption of free chlorine by pb ii therefore by reducing the nom concentrations and elevating the ph dic and consumed free chlorine consumption s1 most strongly suppressed pb ii dissolution when compared to other ceps despite the higher biodegradability in s2 s1 is the only applicable cep for suppressing pb dissolution the specificities of dic and nom which affect the ti ß pbo2 anodes require further study in addition as shown in fig si 2 s1 removed approximately 70 of nh4 n in the rolc and reduced the tn by 70 the abatement of nitrogenous species lessens the risk of chloramination which destabilizes the pbo2 layer lin et al 2008 therefore the applicability of s1 is thereby not limited to rolc and it can be used in other high salinity wastewaters after ammonia stripping while ensuring minimal pb ii toxicity toward biological treatment azizi et al 2016 3 5 energy consumption to visualize the energy distribution of ceps heatmaps of kwh kgcod 1 fig 6 and kwh m 3 fig si 7 were used to depict the energy consumption during rolc treatment text si 5 a conversion factor of 1 00 rmb to 0 14 usd was used the cost of aluminum is approximately 2 22 usd kg 1 and the industrial energy consumption in china is approximately 0 094 usd kwh 1 the analyses by kwh kgcod 1 generated a cost hierarchy of s2 s1 p2 p1 fig 6 by considering the aluminum costs all of the ceps incurred similar operational costs of 3 4 usd kgcod 1 the most expensive cep was s1 at 3 94 usd kgcod 1 whereas the most economical cep was p1 at 3 15 usd kgcod 1 table si 6 in a comparison with other combined electrochemical treatments of rolc such as ec electro fenton s1 was approximately 28 cheaper while achieving a 40 higher cod removal ding et al 2021 table si 6 in addition singular electrochemical processes for rolc treatment were found to require 6 8 h of treatment as opposed to 3 5 h zhou et al 2016 fernandes et al 2019 advanced catalytic processes reduced the time to 2 5 h but incurred more than 140 kwh kgcod 1 with a cod removal of less than 70 zhou et al 2015 despite the superior performance of s1 an in depth economic assessment is required to confirm the potential for upscaling this technology 4 conclusions four cep configurations were studied by comparing the sequence and electrode arrangements for rolc treatment the synergistic integration of ti ß pbo2 anodes and aluminum cathodes as s1 series ec eoec optimally achieved 96 cod removal in 3 5 h as an economical configuration at 3 86 usd kgcod 1 by enforcing the s1 arrangement the bod5 cod ratio of rolc transformed from 0 015 to 0 530 through the simultaneous generation of rcs and al oh 3 to respectively open phenolic structures and adsorb poorly oxidizable chains however the s2 arrangement series eoec ec achieved a higher biodegradability ratio of 0 640 which was presumably due to the higher affinities of cl2 ocl and cl for aromatic structures however only the s1 arrangement successfully reduced pb ii dissolution from the ti ß pbo2 anodes to 0 061 mg l 1 the optimized system is being patented as nio for future studies unequal anodic and cathodic current densities should be investigated to optimize the aluminum dissolution further and to decrease the operational costs declaration of competing interest there are no conflicts

17198,reverse osmosis ro is a widely applied technique for wastewater effluent reuse and landfill leachate treatment the latter generates a refractory ro leachate concentrate rolc for which cost effective treatment is required this study focuses on a two step electrochemical method consisting of aluminum based electrocoagulation ec and simultaneous electrooxidation electrocoagulation with a titanium based lead dioxide ti ß pbo2 anode and aluminum cathode eoec assembly the sequence and electrode arrangements of the combined electrochemical process were investigated to determine the organic transformation ti ß pbo2 anode viability and energy consumption series based ec eoec decreased the total chemical oxygen demand cod from 8750 mg l 1 to 380 mg l 1 a 96 removal efficiency in 3 5 hours at 141 a m 2 under a low energy consumption of 28 7 kwh kgcod 1 the rolc biodegradability bod5 cod significantly increased from 0 015 to 0 530 which was ascribed to aromatic removal e g c c and an increase in cooh functional groups furthermore the rapid removal of natural organic matter and increase in ph elevation from ec suppressed the dissolution of pb from the ti ß pbo2 anode during the subsequent eoec thereby leaving 0 061 mg l 1 in the rolc after treatment the treatment cost was 3 86 usd kgcod 1 which was approximately 34 lower than that of previously reported electrochemical

tonnes by 2025 thereby making the leachate treatment a prominent challenge worldwide abunama et al 2018 costa et al 2019 membrane technologies such as reverse osmosis ro have been adopted in more than 20 of landfill leachate treatment plants worldwide to fulfill stringent discharge standards e g rejection rates 98 99 for ro renou et al 2008a šír et al 2012 cingolani et al 2018 however such technologies inevitably form ro leachate concentrate rolc an undesirable by product that contains recalcitrant organics such as humic and fulvic acids inorganics and heavy metals shah et al 2017 at concentrations up to 20 times the original feed zhou et al 2011 the less biodegradable i e biochemical oxygen demand bod5 chemical oxygen demand cod 0 1 and refractory characteristics of rolc create a costly and challenging problem chen et al 2019a the current treatment methods for rolc are typically categorized into four divisions namely i recirculation to landfill sites ii solidification stabilization e g fly ash and reactivated gypsum iii evaporation distillation and iv advanced oxidation processes aops such as ozonation and fenton oxidation wang et al 2016 however owing to the harsh constituents of rolc recirculation to landfill sites restrains microbial activity for degradation thereby threatening further biological treatment processes for landfill leachate the ro system also suffers from excessive humic fouling and weaker permeating flow rates when reprocessing the recirculated leachate renou et al 2008b however solidification stabilization on the other hand requires costly hydraulic binders such as cement and fly ash which are equivalent to 34 usd t 1 and 93 usd t 1 of treated rolc respectively hendrych et al 2019 the evaporation distillation process includes mechanical vapor recompression mvr and submerged combustion evaporation sce as potential options however humic substances cause mineral scaling in mvr ye et al 2017 whereas sce produces residue without guaranteeing ammonia removal zhang et al 2019 in contrast aops degrade rolc at the expense of the continuous addition of chemical reagents e g hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid for oxidation and ph control wang et al 2019 an alternative to rolc treatment is the in situ formation of coagulants and oxidants through electrochemical processes such as electrocoagulation ec and electrooxidation eo ec and eo have been shown to respectively remove 70 and 88 of cod in rolc within 6 h of treatment zhou et al 2016 fernandes et al 2019 särkkä et al 2015 elucidated the benefits of al based ec over alum dosing in which larger and more resistant flocs are produced the aluminum hydroxide al oh 3 generated during ec has a strong adsorption affinity for humic acids which are abundant in rolc jin et al 2018 however eo with materials such as titanium based lead dioxide ti ß pbo2 generates oxidative reagents notably active chlorine and free radicals e g oh owing to high oxygen overpotentials 1 9 v vs standard hydrogen electrode the ti ß pbo2 anode is also more stable than ti sno2 and is less costly than boron doped diamonds si bdd thereby making it a strong candidate for rolc degradation panizza and cerisola 2009 however the toxic leaching of pb ii ions dissuades the use of ti ß pbo2 anodes gurung et al 2018 moreover individual electrochemical processes are additionally incapable of rapidly eliminating pollutants without severe energy expenditures deng et al 2020 combined electrochemical processes ceps that strategically merge ec and eo may overcome the abovementioned key challenges by conducting ec with aluminum the initial organic load consisting of humic acids can be significantly reduced the efficiency and duration of the subsequent eo step can be improved by the prior removal of refractory compounds via ec additionally the amphoteric property of aluminum permits ec to be implemented during eo as eoec benhadji et al 2011 the design of eoec in which aluminum serves as the cathode can also limit the dissolution of pb ii ions from ti ß pbo2 anodes the reduction of the pbo2 coating by water is favorable below a ph of 7 2 lin and valentine 2010 whereas rolc has an alkaline nature with a ph of 7 9 and 8 2 therefore the consumption of alkalinity or the presence of other reductants such as natural organic matter nom may instigate the dissolution of pb ii lin and valentine 2009 fernandes et al 2017 to avert this phenomenon aluminum based ec could be strategically implemented before or during eo ti ß pbo2 anode and al cathode to raise the ph and remove nom while maintaining a high treatment efficacy in this study a two step electrochemical process integrating ec and eoec was developed for rolc treatment the cep sequence ec or eoec as the first step and electrode arrangements monopolar parallel or series were investigated in terms of the changes in cod total organic carbon toc specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 and color reduction furthermore the cep mechanism biodegradability ti ß pbo2 anode viability and cost were analyzed and discussed it is expected that by optimizing the cep significant rolc degradation and biodegradability enhancements can be attained while effectively preserving the ti ß pbo2 anode 2 materials and methods 2 1 leachate source the landfill leachate concentrate processed from disc tube ro was obtained from the xiaping solid waste landfill in shenzhen china the characteristics of the rolc are presented in table 1 2 2 electrochemical configuration all of the electrochemical tests were performed in undivided cells fig 1 as a two step process the electrode arrangements were all monopolar and designed as follows a parallel ec eoec p1 b series ec eoec s1 c parallel eoec ec p2 and d series eoec ec s2 the rolc was unfiltered when transferring the effluent to the subsequent treatment step as the cod toc and sludge volume index svi were found to decrease text si 1 and fig si 1 each run consisted of 300 ml of rolc without ph modification or chemical addition a constant stirring speed of 150 rpm was maintained throughout the experiments in ec eoec the ec phase consisted of four plates with 10 mm gaps which were intercalated as two aluminum anodes and two carbon graphite cathodes both of 99 9 purity 70 100 mm the total active surface area was determined to be 126 cm2 the current density was 141 a m 2 for 30 min under uniform current distribution which was deemed optimal from preliminary testing the eoec phase was designed with four intercalated plates of two ti ß pbo2 mesh anodes 70 100 mm 1 3 mm coating thickness and two aluminum cathodes eoec was executed for 180 min and the active surface area current density and interelectrode spacing were identical to those in the ec setup for eoec ec the treatment order was reversed when adjusting the arrangement from parallel to series the current density was maintained for the control without cathodic dissolution a titanium cathode was utilized of the same dimension was utilized the anodes and cathodes were exchanged after each run 2 3 analytical methods throughout the experiment samples were respectively taken at 15 min and 30 min intervals during ec and eoec respectively all of the samples underwent filtration through a 0 45 µm filter sartorius minisart prior to further analyses the rolc was subjected to

uv absorbance suva254 for each subsample was measured at 254 nm by obtaining the uv absorption coefficient cm 1 against the toc concentration of the corresponding sample the wavelengths at 203 nm and 253 nm were also measured for organic structural interpretation the lead pb concentration was quantified using a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer gfaas hitachi za3000 japan to verify the pb ii dissolution from the treatments the generated sludge was also acidified to verify the pb concentration all of the samples were measured after acidification with 5 nitric acid the untreated rolc and electrochemically treated samples were freeze dried for 48 h at 50 c and ground homogeneously into powder form high resolution x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analyses were conducted on a kratos analytical axis ultra dld photoelectron spectrometer the lyophilized samples were mixed with kbr at a 1 100 ratio and analyzed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir vertex 70 hyperion 1000 bruker to determine the functional group alterations throughout the different ceps all of the samples were measured in triplicate the chemicals and reagents used were of analytical grade and were utilized as received without further purification 3 results and discussion 3 1 roles of sequence and arrangement all of the electrode arrangements i e s1 series ec eoec s2 series eoec ec p1 parallel ec eoec and p2 parallel eoec ec rapidly reduced the cod over 210 min following the pseudo first order kinetics and the order of effectiveness was s1 s2 p1 p2 table 2 the optimal arrangement was s1 which achieved 95 7 4 1 cod reduction at an averaged removal rate constant of 1 479 10 2 min 1 comparatively inverting the sequence by starting with eoec i e s2 reduced the cod removal rate by 1 41 times kobs 1 052 10 2 min 1 thereby resulting in a 91 7 6 4 cod removal fig 2 a furthermore the instantaneous current efficiencies ice in s1 and s2 yielded the highest peaks of 236 6 and 265 4 respectively compared with those to p1 136 6 and p2 138 9 see fig 2b and text si 2 thereby indicating that greater quantities of oxidants and coagulants are present for cod removal in series arrangements ahmed basha et al 2010 the ices of ec in p1 123 1 and s1 172 8 were much higher than those in p2 10 9 and s2 30 7 table si 1 indicating a superior current utilization efficiency when ec was arranged before eoec significant cod reductions were accompanied by near 100 decolorization and enhanced toc removal as displayed in fig 2c compared with the cod reduction rates the decolorization rates also followed the pseudo first order kinetics and the order of effectiveness was maintained as s1 s2 p1 p2 table 2 s1 achieved 99 2 0 6 color removal in 150 min with the highest averaged decolorization rate of 2 681 10 2 min 1 whereas the decolorization constants of s2 p1 and p2 were respectively 1 12 1 36 and 23 9 times lower respectively i e 2 403 10 2 1 977 10 2 and 1 12 10 3 min 1 despite the significant cod removal and decolorization in s1 a toc reduction of only 72 4 1 was achieved fig 2d the other electrode arrangements reduced the toc by 61 5 s2 63 5 p1 and 38 4 p2 in evaluating the characteristics of the removed toc fig 2e reveals that suva254 progression is an indicator of aromaticity in both series arrangements the suva254 reductions were superior s1 64 6 5 2 s2 67 4 5 8 to their parallel counterparts p1 55 9 6 7 p2 46 8 5 7 specifically p1 increased the suva254 during ec 0 min to 30 min thereby suggesting the removal of carbonaceous compounds without aromatic properties i e aliphatics however the ec in s1 removed aromatic compounds which was indicated by an increase and decrease in suva254 from 0 min to 30 min the suva254 discrepancy between p1 and s1 during ec might have been attributed to the quantity of aluminum dissolved as depicted in fig 2f during the ec of s1 the dissolution constant was 1 85 times higher than that of p1 at 1 538 10 2 g min 1 which provided 84 1 4 3 more dissolved aluminum see table si 2 and text si 3 the greater dissolution of aluminum induced by series arrangements may lead to the agglomeration of al oh 3 into a sweep floc thereby capturing uv quenching substances cañizares et al 2005 although s1 yielded the greatest cod toc and color removal the total aluminum dissolution from s2 was the highest among the ceps s2 s1 p1 p2 thereby indicating that increased aluminum dissolution does not correlate to better performance this can be explained by the ph evolution during treatment fig si 3 the increase in ph toward a threshold value of 10 in s1 and s2 attained an equilibrium of al oh 3 al oh 4 which might have lowered the ec efficiency jiménez et al 2012 although this hypothesis may explain the underperformance of ec near the end of the treatment for p2 and s2 further investigation is required to determine the cathodic ec efficiency in eoec the aluminum dissolution rates were analyzed to investigate the difference in ec efficiency between the parallel and series arrangements according to faraday s law text si 3 a constant of 9 95 10 3 g min 1 was determined as the theoretical dissolution rate with time as the sole variable song et al 2017 series arrangements invoked higher dissolution rates than the theoretical value owing to a larger potential difference solak et al 2009 as a side reaction from the water reduction hydroxide ions accumulated near the cathode and chemically attacked the solid aluminum to generate more al oh 3 linares hernández et al 2009 furthermore in increasing concentrations humic acid can chemisorb to aluminum pits thereby reducing the current density output mechelhoff et al 2013 because ec in series arrangements rapidly removes aromatic compounds e g humic substances as supported by the decrease in suva254 fig 2e this generates a positive feedback loop to sustain the current density throughout treatment in addition p1 and s1 yielded similar toc removals with substantial discrepancies in the suva254 reduction trends figs 2d and 2e whereas p1 adsorbed more aliphatic chains s1 subsequently reflected aromatic compounds removal this indicated an aluminum dissolution threshold in which charge neutralization alters to the formation of sweep flocs and aids facilitates the removal of aromatic compounds cañizares et al 2005 3 2 eoec insight with a chloride surrogate using chloride as a surrogate the dominant mechanism during eoec for each cep was investigated by comparing the chloride to cod ratio as shown in fig 3 a the eo of rolc was performed with an inert cathode i e titanium as the control thereby revealing a high correlation between the chloride consumed and the degraded cod r2 0 9604 during all of the experiments the chloride concentration during ec was found to be stable having oscillated by 3 8 suggesting that the cathodic ec acts as an interference i e only anodic eo degrades the cod with chloride consumption therefore when incorporating the aluminum cathode as shown in figs 3b and 3c the linear regression between cod and chloride decreased in the order of s1 0 8821 p1 0 7065 s2 0 6361 p2 0 5341 the decrease in the linear correlation implied a higher contribution from the cathodic ec because the al oh 3 removed cod without affecting the chloride concentrations the linear correlation of p1 and s1 was observed to be larger than that of p2 and s2 which was presumably due to the performance of ec prior to eoec thereby weakening the subsequent cathodic ec to confirm the contributions of anodic oxidation and cathodic adsorption to removal efficiency in eoec cod and carbon balances were performed table si 3 the analysis estimated that s2 yielded the highest mineralization rate of 35 8 whereas the other arrangements reflected lower efficiencies in s1 22 0 p1 9 7 and p2 3 6 furthermore less cathodic ec adsorption of cod occurred in p1 and s1 21 1 and 14 1 respectively than in p2 and s2 32 4 and 41 4 respectively thereby mirroring the linear regression analysis the cod balance additionally revealed that s1 achieved the highest cod removal efficiency owing to the initial ec step whereas s2 mineralized and adsorbed more pollutants than s1 during eoec series arrangements induce higher cell voltages mollah et al 2004 the increased hydrolysis during eoec prevents the accumulation of oxidized by products on the anode surface thereby increasing the anodic efficiency martínez huitle and brillas 2009 theoretically ti ß pbo2 anodes possess a wide anodic potential window of 1 5 v to 1 8 v vs ag agcl and are capable of both direct and indirect oxidation via physisorbed hydroxyl radicals oh and reactive chlorine species rcs panizza and martinez huitle 2013 aquino et al 2014 under alkaline conditions ph 7 45 chloride oxidation generates hypochlorite ions ocl as follows eqs 1 3 1 2 c l c l 2 2 e 2 c l 2 h 2 o hclo h c l 3 hclo h oc l 4 c l c l ads e 5 c l c l ads cl 2 e 6 c l oc l oc l c l 7 hco 3 o h co 3 h 2 o 8 co 3 oc l oc l co 3 2 although ti ß pbo2 anodes can also generate adsorbed chlorine radicals cl cl and ocl rapidly scavenge cl to respectively form cl2 k 8 5 109 m 1 s 1 and ocl k 8 3 109 m 1 s 1 eqs 5 6 guo et al 2017 in addition ocl can be formed indirectly via optimal concentrations of hco3 10 mm and cl 60 mm which are present in rolc eqs 7 8 zheng et al 2020 however as ocl is selective toward methoxy based aromatics guo et al 2017 the degradation effectiveness is insignificant in ec eoec p1 and s1 and short lived in eoec ec p2 and s2 alternatively cl can directly degrade oxygenated functional groups in aromatic structures through single electron transfers varanasi et al 2018 park et al 2009 contended that cl2 is the dominant oxidant in high salinity solutions and that the reaction toward aromatic compounds governs oxidation rate constants up to 5 orders of magnitudes greater than that of ocl i e 109 m 1 s 1 vs 104 m 1 s 1 therefore cl2 cl ocl physisorbed oh were presumed to be the chief generated oxidants in all of the ceps however the effect of cl2 may be lower in p1 and s1 than in p2 and s2 owing to the reduced aromaticity after ec as the chloride concentration decreased over time the favorability of cl may increase near the end of treatment 3 3 organic transformation and biodegradability chloride ions are consumed in proportion to the oxidation of the organic load via the formation of chlorine based oxidants fernandes et al 2016 this was validated by comparing the carbonaceous average oxidation state aos text si 4 to the present chloride concentration of each configuration fig 4 in p1 and s1 the aos respectively decreased from 5 79 to 8 29 and 7 34 respectively during the ec phase owing to the rapid uptake of toc subsequently the aos continuously increased to 1 63 and 2 48 respectively furthermore inversing the treatment sequence to p2 and s2 elevated the aos to 3 42 and 1 88 respectively parallel arrangements i e p1 and p2 could not drive the carbonaceous aos of rolc beyond zero the functional groups of the untreated and oxidized rolc were identified fig si 4 and compared to the aromatic substitution index uv253 uv203 and biodegradability bod5 cod six major functional groups were profiled as intermolecular o h stretching 3388 cm 1 c o 1641 cm 1 c c 1590 cm 1 cooh 1430 cm 1 c c shoulder 1135 cm 1 and c oh stretching vibrations 1035 cm 1 as a qualitative complement to the ft ir peaks xps measurements were conducted fig si 5 the total peak area of each deconvoluted c 1s spectrum was fractionated to specify each of the identified carbon peaks fig 5 accordingly the peaks found at 284 9 0 1 286 5 0 2 288 3 0 3 and 289 3 0 2 ev were associated with aliphatic aromatic carbon c c c c c oh amide i c o and carboxylates cooh respectively in addition the uv253 uv203 ratio reflected the presence of aromatic functional groups higher values indicated carbonyl and ester groups whereas smaller values were attributed to aliphatic chains iskander et al 2018 series based ceps s1 and s2 lowered the amount of c oh and c o as amide i and significantly increased the amount of cooh specifically the highest contents of cooh were present in s1 and s2 at 28 and 22 respectively compared with 11 in the untreated control fig 5a in addition the ceps in the series arrangements reduced the c o content from 10 control to 6 s1 and 8 s2 whereas the arrangements in parallel increased the content to 16 and 18 in p1 and p2 respectively furthermore the c oh content decreased to 14 in series arrangements whereas it increased to 25 in p2 under the xps analyses the peaks near 284 6 ev represented both aliphatic chains c c and sp2 hybridized non oxygenated aromatic rings c c c c leung et al 1992 rong et al 2015 therefore the degradation of c c into c c could not be detected via xps analysis as shown by the approximately 3 5 variation in all of the ceps after treatment fig 5a however the ft ir results demonstrated a significant reduction at 1590 cm 1 in s1 and s2 thereby confirming the degradation of the c c bonds fig si 4 moreover the biodegradability in the series arrangements was superior to that in the parallel arrangements s1 and s2 both transformed the rolc into a highly biodegradable effluent thereby significantly boosting the bod5 cod ratio from 0 015 to 0 529 and 0 640 respectively whereas the ratios of p1 and p2 remained at 0 095 and 0 035 respectively the aromatic substitution indexes uv253 uv203 of p1 s1 and s2 were reduced from 0 42 in the untreated rolc to 0 14 0 14 and 0 12 respectively whereas that of p2 decreased to 0 28 fig 5b therefore lower aromatic substitution indexes are not correlated with high biodegradability but may enable aromatic degradation for the treated rolc to be amenable to biological treatment recalcitrant compounds such as humic substances must be degraded or removed beforehand the refractory nature of humic substances possesses strong correlations with long chain hydrocarbons and aromaticity i e c c and c c zhang et al 2013 chen et al 2019b which are often reflected at wavenumbers of 1135 and 1590 cm 1 to 1640 cm 1 in ft ir spectroscopy qi et al 2018 deng et al 2019 although aliphatic hydrocarbons c c and oxidized intermediates are resistant to ocl and cl attack rajkumar et al 2005 rajkumar et al 2007 varanasi et al 2018 smaller aromatic constituents are swiftly degraded by cl2 and ocl park et al 2009 jing et al 2019 this explains the higher mineralization rate in s2 than in s1 as more aromatic compounds are present when performing eoec before ec the generated rcs attacks oxygen bound substitutions in aromatic rings thereby leading to a decrease in c o and an increase in c o functional groups jing et al 2019 however the decrease in c o in s1 and s2 was attributed to high adsorption from cathodic ec furthermore the decreases in c oh groups detected in s1 and s2 were generally tied to c o stretching and phenoxy structures chen et al 2015 the destruction of these substituents c oh enables the opening of phenolic constituents for enhanced degradation comninellis 1994 as such the degradation of rolc generated many oxidized intermediates which can be estimated by the cod toc ratios table si 4 for example s1 yielded the lowest ratio of approximately 0 38 thereby indicating the presence of more oxidized carbonaceous compounds with states of 3 such as carboxylic acids saroj et al 2005 this is supported by fig 5a which illustrates a significant increase in cooh and by the evolution of aos as shown in fig 4 generally low aos values of 4 signify unoxidized carbon such as methane whereas high aos values of 4 resemble heavily oxidized carbonaceous compounds such as carbon dioxide the analysis predicted an aos value of 5 79 for the untreated rolc thereby indicating an abundance of electron rich groups such as amines de vera et al 2017 as shown in fig si 6 p2 accounted for the least variance in oxidation state shifts whereas s1 and s2 yielded carbonaceous oxidation states of approximately 2 after 210 min 20 8 ah l 1 of charge passed although increases in the oxidation states also warrants concern regarding the formation of disinfection by products dbps further discussed in text si 4 cathodic ec may be capable of strongly adsorbing dbp precursors owing to their negative charges ghernaout et al 2009 future studies should be conducted to determine whether the order and configuration of the electrochemical setups can influence the formation of dbps 3 4 pb ii dissolution the use of ti ß pbo2 anodes is impeded by the dissolution of pb ii the dissolution pathway is conditional and suppressed by increasing ph lin and valentine 2010 dissolved inorganic carbon dic wang et al 2010 and free chlorine wang et al 2013 but accelerated by nom lin and valentine 2009 therefore for a comprehensive investigation the anodic pb dissolution pb concentrations in the raw and cep treated samples abovementioned factors and the generated sludge containing pb were analyzed table 3 ceps were the primary focus in series arrangements owing to their highest performances the data for parallel arrangements can be compared in table si 5 during s1 ec first removed the preexisting pb to undetectable levels adsorbing 0 078 mg of pb into the sludge thereafter eoec released approximately 0 042 mg of pb the cathodic ec adsorbed 0 103 mg of pb while 0 061 mg l 1 was not removed however s2 released around 2 2 times more pb approximately 0 092 mg and transferred 0 140 mg of pb into the sludge while 0 106 mg l 1 remained in the solution the subsequent ec was ineffective for pb removal by comparing s1 and s2 eoec in s1 generated 514 8 to 783 6 mg l 1 of dic but removed 876 8 703 8 mg l 1 in s2 the initial concentration of nom before running eoec was approximately 66 5 greater in s2 from 3576 mg l 1 than that in s1 from 2148 mg l 1 owing to the treatment sequence the reductive effect of nom may be greater than that of dic in shifting the favorability of pb ii dissolution furthermore the ceps in the parallel arrangements respectively released 0 245 mg and 0 325 mg of pb ii in p1 and p2 respectively which were 5 7 and 3 5 times greater than those of their respective series based counterparts although s2 provided excellent rolc treatment s1 was shown to be the only cep to sufficiently deter pb ii release pb ii leaching is generally controlled by modifying the ti ß pbo2 electrode via rare earth metal doping techniques or inclusion of inter layers zhao et al 2014 our study is the first attempt to electrochemically promote unfavorable conditions for pb ii dissolution previous studies have shown that pb dissolution is catalyzed under reductive constituents such as natural organic matter nom and is decelerated in neutral to alkaline ph conditions lin and valentine 2009 lin and valentine 2010 furthermore as little as 1 mg free cl2 l 1 can oxidize pb ii back into the pbo2 electrode coating wang et al 2013 and the oxidation can be accelerated if dic is present wang et al 2010 although both s1 and s2 surpassed the required free chlorine threshold the lower concentration in s1 might have been attributed to the consumption of free chlorine by pb ii therefore by reducing the nom concentrations and elevating the ph dic and consumed free chlorine consumption s1 most strongly suppressed pb ii dissolution when compared to other ceps despite the higher biodegradability in s2 s1 is the only applicable cep for suppressing pb dissolution the specificities of dic and nom which affect the ti ß pbo2 anodes require further study in addition as shown in fig si 2 s1 removed approximately 70 of nh4 n in the rolc and reduced the tn by 70 the abatement of nitrogenous species lessens the risk of chloramination which destabilizes the pbo2 layer lin et al 2008 therefore the applicability of s1 is thereby not limited to rolc and it can be used in other high salinity wastewaters after ammonia stripping while ensuring minimal pb ii toxicity toward biological treatment azizi et al 2016 3 5 energy consumption to visualize the energy distribution of ceps heatmaps of kwh kgcod 1 fig 6 and kwh m 3 fig si 7 were used to depict the energy consumption during rolc treatment text si 5 a conversion factor of 1 00 rmb to 0 14 usd was used the cost of aluminum is approximately 2 22 usd kg 1 and the industrial energy consumption in china is approximately 0 094 usd kwh 1 the analyses by kwh kgcod 1 generated a cost hierarchy of s2 s1 p2 p1 fig 6 by considering the aluminum costs all of the ceps incurred similar operational costs of 3 4 usd kgcod 1 the most expensive cep was s1 at 3 94 usd kgcod 1 whereas the most economical cep was p1 at 3 15 usd kgcod 1 table si 6 in a comparison with other combined electrochemical treatments of rolc such as ec electro fenton s1 was approximately 28 cheaper while achieving a 40 higher cod removal ding et al 2021 table si 6 in addition singular electrochemical processes for rolc treatment were found to require 6 8 h of treatment as opposed to 3 5 h zhou et al 2016 fernandes et al 2019 advanced catalytic processes reduced the time to 2 5 h but incurred more than 140 kwh kgcod 1 with a cod removal of less than 70 zhou et al 2015 despite the superior performance of s1 an in depth economic assessment is required to confirm the potential for upscaling this technology 4 conclusions four cep configurations were studied by comparing the sequence and electrode arrangements for rolc treatment the synergistic integration of ti ß pbo2 anodes and aluminum cathodes as s1 series ec eoec optimally achieved 96 cod removal in 3 5 h as an economical configuration at 3 86 usd kgcod 1 by enforcing the s1 arrangement the bod5 cod ratio of rolc transformed from 0 015 to 0 530 through the simultaneous generation of rcs and al oh 3 to respectively open phenolic structures and adsorb poorly oxidizable chains however the s2 arrangement series eoec ec achieved a higher biodegradability ratio of 0 640 which was presumably due to the higher affinities of cl2 ocl and cl for aromatic structures however only the s1 arrangement successfully reduced pb ii dissolution from the ti ß pbo2 anodes to 0 061 mg l 1 the optimized system is being patented as nio for future studies unequal anodic and cathodic current densities should be investigated to optimize the aluminum dissolution further and to decrease the operational costs declaration of competing interest there are no conflicts

17199,identification of mib 2 methylisoborneol producing cyanobacteria in source water has been a big challenge for reservoir authorities because it normally requires isolation of cyanobacteria strains here a protocol based on pearson s product moment correlation analysis combined with standardized data treatment and expert judgement was developed to sort out the mib producer s mainly based on routine monitoring data from an estuary drinking water reservoir in the yangtze river china and a risk model using quantile regressions was established to evaluate the risk of mib occurrences this reservoir has suffered from mib problems in summer since 2011 among 323 phytoplankton species planktothrix was judged to be the mib producer in this reservoir because it exhibited the highest correlation coefficient r 0 60 as well as the lowest false positive ratio fp 0 and false negative rate fn 14 the low false positive rate is particularly important since mib should not detected without detection of the producer a high light extinction coefficient k 5 57 2 48 m 1 attributed to high turbidity loading in the river water lowered the subsurface water light intensity which could protect the low irradiance planktothrix from excessive solar radiation and allow them to grow throughout the summer the risk model shows that the probability of suffering unacceptable mib concentrations 15 ng l 1 in water is as high as 90 if the cell density of planktothrix is 609 0 cell ml 1 while the risk will be significantly reduced to 50 and 10 at cell densities of 37 5 cell ml 1 and 9 6 cell ml 1 respectively the approach developed in this study including the protocol for identification of potential producers and the risk model could provide a reference case for the management of source water suffering from mib problems using routine monitoring data keywords 2 methylisoborneol mib planktothrix subsurface cyanobacteria reservoir odor 1 introduction taste odor represents one of the most important features of drinking water quality and often ranks at the top among customer complaint call records dietrich and burlingame 2015 2 methylisoborneol mib with an odor threshold concentration as low as 10 15 ng l 1 is responsible for most earthy musty odor episodes in the northern hemisphere and has now been moving southward berglind et al 1983 izaguirre and taylor 2007 sun et al 2014 suurnäkki et al 2015 tsuchiya and matsumoto 1988 the removal of mib requires special treatments including powdered activated carbon adsorption or ozone oxidation resulting in increased treatment cost watson et al 2007 controlling the growth of mib producers in source water reservoirs lakes which could relieve the stress on water treatment is thus becoming an attractive approach su et al 2017 filamentous cyanobacteria including oscillatoria sp naes et al 1988 phormidium sp pseudanabaena sp planktothrix sp leptolyngbya bijugata wang et al 2015 and jaaginema geminatum tsuchiya and matsumoto 1988 have often been reported to be responsible for the production of mib in water sources the identification of mib producers in problematic reservoirs could benefit the understanding of their ecological niches driving forces and risk evaluation which is essential for the development of on site control techniques so far however identification of the mib producing cyanobacteria remains cumbersome it includes a procedure to isolate the possible strains followed by culture experiments to verify the production of mib recently quantitative real time pcr qpcr has been developed to detect the mib synthesis genes in water chiu et al 2016 giglio et al 2011 suurnäkki et al 2015 while the qpcr method has an advantage in providing important information regarding the mib production potential it cannot provide taxonomy information in addition most source water authorities normally do not have the professional experience and knowledge required for the isolation of mib producing cyanobacteria molecular based approaches and other advanced research level work however they have the resources to perform routine monitoring schemes which could provide comprehensive information regarding the phytoplankton community mib dynamics and some physico chemical parameters owing to mandatory regulations and or relatively low cost these routine data usually have the merit of high frequency up to weekly or even daily levels and being available for periods covering a long time scale in comparison with research based monitoring data it is thus possible to develop an approach to identify the possible mib producers and evaluate the risk of mib occurrences based on the existing dataset here a protocol based on pearson s product moment correlation analysis pearson 1895 combined with standardized data treatment and expert judgement was developed to sort out the mib producer s and a risk model using quantile regressions was established to evaluate the risk of mib occurrence an estuary drinking water reservoir qcs reservoir in the yangtze river was selected as the study object using its routine data on the phytoplankton community and mib dynamics over the period 2011 2016 this reservoir is the largest drinking water source for shanghai and has been suffering from mib problems since it was put into use in 2011 identification of mib producers and associated risk evaluation of mib occurrence have thus become increasingly important for the reservoir authority the mib producers and risks in qcs reservoir were subsequently determined and the reason for the mib producer s growth throughout the summer was also discussed this study makes it possible to uncover the source of odorants in drinking water reservoirs by using routine data by modeling the correlation between phytoplankton abundance and mib concentrations it can evaluate the risk of mib occurrences for management purpose meanwhile this study is the first work related to mib problems in qcs reservoir and can be regarded as exemplary research for use as a reference for source water authorities and water supply companies 2 methods 2 1 study area and sampling qcs reservoir located in the yangtze estuary is a new reservoir that receives water from the yangtze river and has been in use since 2011 the reservoir was built along the northern coast of an island with a maximum storage capacity of 437 5 gl and a surface area of 66 15 km2 two gates located in the northwest upper reach the main inlet and northeast lower reach as shown in fig 1 were designed to exchange freshwater and to prevent saltwater from entering the reservoir during the dry season the reservoir supplies water to waterworks through a water intake located at the end of the reservoir with a daily volume of approximately 2 5 gl d 1 before 2011 and 4 0 5 0 gl d 1 after 2012 it now serves as the main drinking water source for shanghai the bathymetry map shows that the water depth in the reservoir varies from 2 7 m in the upstream area to 12 1 m in the downstream area and an island in the upper section splits the water flow into two branches figure s1 the mean hydraulic retention time between april to september 21 3 to 23 8 days is much shorter than other months 47 6 to 124 1 days samples were collected over a period from 2011 to 2016 a total of 17 sampling sites were selected covering different regions of the reservoir fig 1 samples from 3 sites qc01 qc02 and qc09 had higher frequency up to 1 2 times per week since the whole reservoir is well mixed only surface water samples of approximately 2 l were taken using a kemmerer water sampler from below the water surface 0 5 m a detailed spatial survey was performed in june 10 2014 which involved 46 sites covering the whole reservoir figure s2 2 2 phytoplankton identification and physicochemical analysis subsamples 1000 ml for cell enumeration were preserved with 5 lugol s iodine sherr and sherr 1993 and left to settle for 48 h then pre concentrated 20 and kept in the dark until cell counting the identification of cyanobacterial species was carried out following komárek and anagnostidis 1998 and revised according to komarek et al 2014 the phytoplankton were identified and enumerated using an upright microscope olympus bx53 japan following the protocol established by utermöhl 1958 subsamples for determination of mib were stored in light blocking bottles with an airtight stopper the total mib concentration was measured and used to calculate the mib production potential 10 mg l 1 hgcl2 was added to the samples to prevent biodegradation li et al 2010 and they were analyzed within 72 h using the solid phase micro extraction spme method coupled with gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms agilent 6890 5975 agilent tech usa according to a procedure established based on liang et al 2005 and described in a previous study su et al 2015 physicochemical variables such as water temperature ph dissolved oxygen do turbidity and conductivity were measured in situ with a multi parameter probe exo2 us water transparency expressed as secchi depth sd was measured with a secchi disk diameter 20 cm black and white nutrient concentrations including nitrate nitrite ammonia total nitrogen tn and total phosphate tp were analyzed according to the national standard methods of china 2 3 identification of potential mib producers the odor threshold concentration otc of mib was adopted as 15 ng l 1 according to a previous study su et al 2015 in order to sort out the potential mib producers candidates based on the routine data a ranking protocol was developed and performed as below data smoothing consolidate the raw data points with shorter time units sampling interval t into groups with longer units grouping unit t t is recommended to be set to 4 t regarding the case study in qcs reservoir the grouping unit t of 4 weeks was used mib detection rate within each group calculate the proportion of the samples with a mib concentration higher than its otc 15 ng l 1 correlation test for each candidate perform a correlation test between their group level mean abundances and mib detection rate using pearson s product moment correlation test pearson 1895 with a correlation coefficient r and significance of the test p value respectively false positive rate fp the proportion of groups with candidate absent but mib detection rate high than 0 false negative rate fn the proportion of groups with candidate present but mib detection rate being 0 remove candidates with weak correlations find the candidates significantly positively correlated to mib detection rate e g r 0 3 p value 0 1 further find the candidates with low false positive rate e g fp 10 and low false negative rate e g fn 30 expert judgement since mib is mainly produced by several cyanobacterial genera in source water awwa 2010 most candidates can be removed from the list via expert judgement ranking sort the remain candidates according to the following rule ascending order of the sum of the false positive rate and false negative rate sum fp fn descending order of r ascending order of p value 2 4 risk model of mib occurrence and severity quantile regression between the mib concentration and a producer s cell density was performed to build a risk model for mib the false positive and false negative samples were discarded to minimize the measurement error the mib concentration c m i b units ng l 1 and cell density n unit cells ml 1 were firstly log transformed log 1 x and subsequently modeled according to eq 1 1 log 1 c m i b q u a n t i l e log 1 n τ n denotes the cell density of mib producer quantile is a function qr derived from the quantreg package koenker 2017 in r r core team 2017 τ 0 τ 1 denotes the quantiles to be estimated 10 25 50 75 and 90 of τ were selected for the quantile regression the risk of suffering mib problems is determined by the quantile regression model more specifically the quantile regression between the mib concentration and cell density at the τ quantile was used to assess the risk at the 1 τ level when the mib concentration was higher than otc hence the risk can be determined at a given cell density of a mib producer 2 5 statistical analysis and illustration all data analysis and illustration were performed using r 3 4 2 r core team 2017r core team 2017 data pretreatment and summary were performed using the dplyr wickham et al 2018 and base packages in r regression analysis including linear regression and generalized linear regression were performed using the stats package r core team 2017 quantile regression analysis was performed using the quantreg package koenker 2017 all figures were prepared using the ggplot2 package wickham 2016 the boundary of the reservoir was determined according to satellite images and performed in google earth https earth google com 3 results 3 1 limnology temporal distributions of the nutrients and other parameters during the study period are shown in table 1 the reservoir is in general well vertical mixed during all seasons according to the temperature profile figure s3 oxygen deficiency only occurred in the bottom layer 8 0 10 5 m in a very short period in august no significant differences in the nutrient concentrations were observed between all layers of the water column total n showed a clear decreasing pattern from 2 05 0 60 mg l 1 in february to 1 47 0 41 mg l 1 in september nitrate was the major component of nitrogen 85 4 9 5 with a concentration between 1 19 0 45 1 77 0 57 mg l 1 the ammonia concentrations remained low 0 05 0 02 mg l 1 to 0 14 0 12 mg l 1 high conductivity and chloride concentrations were observed in winter which is mainly attributed to saline intrusion the turbidity was 26 6 32 ntu on average exhibited a declining pattern along with water flow from upstream to downstream in the reservoir figure s4 as a result water transparency was rather low compared to other reservoirs such as miyun reservoir lake mathews table 3 with the minimum value of 38 22 cm in the upstream area and the maximum value of 100 15 cm in the downstream area the turbidity and water transparency expressed as secchi depth were highly related figure s2 3 2 phytoplankton ecological community dynamics a total of 323 species belonging to 147 genera and 8 phyla were detected in all samples from qcs reservoir cyanobacteria with 24 genera being detected mainly dominated in summer fig 2 as the major cyanobacteria in summer microcystis was present in 61 7 of summer samples july to october and 46 1 of all samples but no serious cyanobacterial bloom was observed during the investigation period several filamentous cyanobacterial genera including pseudanabaena dolichospermum formerly named anabaena aphanizomenon planktothrix formerly named oscillatoria phormidium and lyngbya were detected with a relatively high cell density and with strong seasonality figure s5 besides these merismopedia also exhibited a high cell density but was perhaps less important due to its small cell volume diatoms with 33 genera being detected dominated in the reservoir most of the time from middle november to the following june cyclotella was the dominant genus with a detection rate of 98 7 followed by aulacoseira 77 6 and skeletonema 56 7 in total 70 genera of green algae were detected with 40 3 of samples containing more than 15 genera suggesting it was an important member in the phytoplankton community the green algae exhibited a relatively high cell density in season transition periods may and november figure s6 scenedesmus and ankistrodesmus were the top two genera with the highest cell densities among green algae with a detection rate of 86 4 and 71 3 respectively another 19 genera belonging to cryptophyta 4 dinophyta 4 euglenophyta 6 chrysophyta 5 respectively were detected in all samples cryptophyta with a non negligible cell density exhibited a similar seasonal pattern as diatoms while the other phyla were present with much lower cell densities chroomonas and cryptomonas were the top two cryptophyta members with detection rate of 94 3 and 81 3 respectively 3 3 occurrence of mib the mib concentration exhibited drastic seasonal variations as shown in fig 3 the reservoir has experienced mib episodes since the first year of operation in 2011 no t o problems were recorded during january to april with mib concentrations of 2 5 5 4 ng l 1 48 quantile to 87 quantile increased mib concentrations were observed in may 3 0 17 1 ng l 1 and june 0 5 15 8 ng l 1 and serious mib problems could occur with low probability 312 6 ng l 1 at 99 quantile high levels of mib occurred in july 9 9 72 0 ng l 1 august 10 8 70 0 ng l 1 and september 19 6 70 0 ng l 1 with 26 0 32 4 and 45 2 of samples respectively exhibiting a concentration higher than the otc the highest concentration of 2528 ng l 1 was recorded on august 17 2011 then the mib concentration markedly decreased to 6 7 19 0 ng l 1 in october with only 9 2 samples exhibiting concentrations higher than the otc the mib problems ended in the following november and december with concentrations of 5 5 7 4 ng l 1 3 4 identification of potential mib producers a total of 32 candidates were obtained by removing the ones weakly correlated with the mib detection rate from the whole list r 0 3 p value 0 1 according to the ranking protocol table 2 among them 21 candidates were removed because of high fp 10 and 5 candidates were removed because of high fn 30 another 5 candidates were removed according to expert judgement more specifically planktothrix and phormidium are potential mib producers according to awwa 2010 and other studies izaguirre and taylor 1995 martin et al 1988 su et al 2015 suurnäkki et al 2015 tabachek and yurkowski 1976 with a false positive rate of 0 and a false negative rate of 14 planktothrix exhibited the lowest false rate false positive rate false negative rate though phormdium exhibited a high correlation coefficient of 0 661 with mib it had a false positive rate as high as 24 in fact another filamentous cyanobacteria pseudanabaena as a potential mib producer was also detected frequently detection rate 30 5 in this reservoir this genus was sorted out because of its high false positive rate 18 7 and low correlation coefficient r 0 0246 p 0 865 in addition the pseudanabaena strain was isolated from the reservoir but it was not able to produce mib in our culture test data not shown taking these aspects into consideration planktothrix with the lowest false positive rate acceptable correlation coefficient and most importantly a history of being responsible for mib episodes is thus regarded as the most likely mib producer in qcs reservoir during the period 2011 to 2016 further a correlation test between the planktothrix cell densities and mib concentrations of all samples raw data without data smoothing shows a strong positive correlation between them r 2 0 8001 p value 0 0001 n 865 providing more evidence that mib was mainly produced by planktothrix in this reservoir 4 discussion 4 1 identification of mib producer s using routine data mib problems have been widely observed in drinking water sources across the globe according to a comprehensive investigation of 77 source water samples from 34 major cities in china mib was present in 75 of them sun et al 2014 although plenty of monitoring data have been recorded little information is available on the mib producer s identification of mib producer s normally includes strain isolation purification culturing and confirmation of mib production in succession which is time consuming in addition isolation of mib producer s requires the operators to have sophisticated experience by comparison the approach developed in this study only requires routine data and therefore is suitable for the purpose of source water management data smoothing can remove random variation and so helps to reveal more clearly the underlying trend simonoff 2012 high variation in the data can be observed frequently when phytoplankton is quantified based on the microscopic technique hence a proper data smoothing process is important involving consolidating the raw data points with shorter time units sampling interval t into longer units grouping unit t here we test the effectiveness of the developed protocol under 10 scenarios with different data smoothing strategies more specifically different grouping units t ranging from the sampling interval t no data smoothing to ten times the sampling interval 10 t were used for each scenario the variations in false positives fp false negatives fn and correlation coefficients r which are the main indicators for identifying mib producer s were obtained for each candidate under 10 scenarios as shown in fig 4 the false positive rate fp denotes that high mib concentrations were observed while the candidate species was not recorded thus the fp is a key parameter since mib should not be produced when mib producers are absent therefore we should strictly reject a hypothesis when the fp is too high e g 10 by contrast the false negative rate fn can be regarded as a less rigorous parameter since mib producer s may cease to produce mib under certain conditions and a higher threshold of fn is acceptable e g 30 fp and fn values are rather robust variables for determining the mib producer and planktothrix with low fp and low fn was ideally separated from other candidates in fact planktothrix is the only candidate that was selected in all scenarios in qcs reservoir while others were filtered out for at least one scenario table s1 the correlation coefficient r represents the degree of fitting between the mib concentration and abundance of a candidate species and should not be too small for the true candidate s planktothrix s r in qcs reservoir ranged from 0 421 to 0 721 so a threshold of r 0 3 should be acceptable for most cases by setting the threshold of fp 10 fn 30 and r 0 3 p 0 1 15 candidates were ranked in the top 10 for at least 1 scenario while planktothrix is the top candidate in all scenarios four genera including eudorina coelastrum schroederia and ulothrix were in second place and seven genera ranked in third place table s2 these top ranking candidates can potentially be the mib producers and expert judgement becomes essential to remove the most unlikely strains it has been reported that the major mib producers are filamentous cyanobacteria including 7 genera under oscillatoriales limnoraphis lyngbya oscillatoria phormidium kamptonema planktothricoides and planktothrix and 5 genera under synechococcales leptolyngbya nodosilinea pseudanabaena synechococcus and jaaginema and 3 other genera under nostocales and pleurocapsales awwa 2010 by combining these processes mib producer s can be effectively identified based on routine data furthermore we have verified this protocal in miyun reservoir planktothrix with lowest false positive rate fp and highest correlation coefficient r was identified as the mib producer table s3 which is identical to su et al 2015 although the protocol developed in this study is transferable to other studies the applications of protocol requires high quality routine data since the phytoplankton communities may change over a short period and the mib episodes may last for a period varying from only one week to several months a bi weekly sampling frequency is required to obtain persuasive results while a weekly or higher sampling frequency is highly recommended besides the thresholds of the three evaluation parameters including fp fn and r used within the protocol are also important their thresholds should be tested and adjusted according to the data quality 4 2 the reason for mib occurrence in summer the earthy odor caused by mib in reservoirs and lakes has been reported since the 1980s as summarized in table 3 mib was detected in lake mathews in september and october of 1980 with the highest concentration of 53 ng l 1 recorded in the end of september and oscillatoria curviceps identified as the main producer izaguirre et al 1982 a mib episode caused by pseudanabaena in castaic lake in september and october of 1993 was recorded by izaguirre and taylor 1998 lake kasumigaura has been reported to suffer frequent occurrences of mib episodes caused by phormidium tenue in the spring and autumn since 1989 sugiura et al 1998 sugiura and nakano 2000 more recently the occurrence of mib problems in feng shen reservoir producer s unidentified and miyun reservoir caused by planktothrix have also been reported su et al 2015 tung et al 2008 yu et al 2009 the mib episodes occurring in different regions in the world could be classified into two types according to the seasons in which they occur table 3 lake mathews lake kasumigaura castaic lake and miyun reservoir experienced mib problems mainly in spring or autumn seasons from april to may or from september to october but not in the summer period from july to august by contrast catfish ponds feng shen reservoir and qcs reservoir experienced continuous mib problems throughout the summer we speculate that the underwater light climate is the main driving force responsible for causing such a difference the reservoirs experiencing mib episodes in the summer period exhibited a relatively high extinction coefficient 4 77 while the others had a relatively low extinction coefficient 3 49 most of the mib producers in aquatic environments are filamentous cyanobacteria including oscillatoria sp naes et al 1988 phormidium sp pseudanabaena sp planktothrix sp leptolyngbya bijugata wang et al 2015 jaaginema geminatum tsuchiya and matsumoto 1988 because of their relatively large cellular projection area these filamentous strains are able to grow under relatively low irradiance conditions according to our previous model based on cellular morphology su et al 2014 in the water bodies with a low extinction coefficient some filamentous cyanobacteria would prefer to grow in spring or autumn to prevent inhibition from excessive solar radiation while in the environments with a high extinction coefficient some other filamentous cyanobacteria could grow even in the summer period because of the greatly weakened underwater light intensity thus the relatively high turbidity loading from the yangtze river figure s4 likely created the conditions for planktothrix to grow in summer in our previous study planktothrix grew in miyun reservoir with very low turbidity in september when the surface microcystis bloom faded away figure s4 su et al 2019 2015 no serious surface microcystis bloom was observed in qcs reservoir the lack of competitors for subsurface planktothrix in summer might also provide a benefit for the growth of planktothrix in summer it should be noted that the impact of environmental conditions on the growth of cyanobacteria is a complicated topic and more efforts are required to understand the behaviors of these filamentous cyanobacteria in different aquatic environment by comparing our two typical and well studied reservoirs miyun reservoir and qcs reservoir the latter with high turbidity loading from the yangtze river figure s4 reduced the subsurface water light intensity therefore the damage from summer radiation was significantly minimized or eliminated in addition no serious surface microcystis bloom was observed in qcs reservoir and the lack of competitors for subsurface planktothrix in summer could also benefit their growth 4 3 risk assessment of the occurrence of mib all 5 quantiles τ 10 25 50 75 and 90 of the quantile regression between planktothrix cell density and mib concentration exhibited positive correlations fig 5 according to this quantile regression model the cell density threshold of planktothrix at a given risk level of having an unacceptable mib concentration c mib otc otc 15 ng l 1 in the reservoir can be determined if the planktothrix cell density is higher than 9 6 cell ml 1 the risk of unacceptable mib will be higher than 10 1 τ and if the cell density increases to 37 5 cell ml 1 the risk will increase to 50 accordingly at a planktothrix cell density of 609 0 cell ml 1 the risk that the reservoir will suffer from mib problems will be very high 90 furthermore the risk of suffering mib problems can be assessed using a risk model based on the quantile regressions with the planktothrix cell density as the model input the model result in qcs reservoir is shown in the inset in fig 5 this risk assessment model is highly expected to be useful for handling mib problems especially for source water authorities the prediction by the model can be used for early warning as well as for the development of countermeasures although the model result is comparable with that for miyun reservoir su et al 2015 a site specific model is highly recommended since the complexity of site specific conditions is far beyond the model parameterization therefore the approach developed in this study including the protocol for the identification of potential mib producers and the model for risk assessment could possibly provide a reference case for managing source water with odor problems if the routine monitoring of phytoplankton and odorants is well organized in the reservoir 5 conclusion an approach was developed in this study for source water management regarding mib odor problems including a protocol for the identification of potential mib producers and model for risk assessment based on routine monitoring data of phytoplankton and odorants planktothrix was identified for the first time as the mib producer in qcs reservoir the occurrence of mib problems in the summer period might be associated with the relatively high turbidity carried by inlet river water according to risk assessment as high as 90 probability of unacceptable mib could occur if the cell

17199,identification of mib 2 methylisoborneol producing cyanobacteria in source water has been a big challenge for reservoir authorities because it normally requires isolation of cyanobacteria strains here a protocol based on pearson s product moment correlation analysis combined with standardized data treatment and expert judgement was developed to sort out the mib producer s mainly based on routine monitoring data from an estuary drinking water reservoir in the yangtze river china and a risk model using quantile regressions was established to evaluate the risk of mib occurrences this reservoir has suffered from mib problems in summer since 2011 among 323 phytoplankton species planktothrix was judged to be the mib producer in this reservoir because it exhibited the highest correlation coefficient r 0 60 as well as the lowest false positive ratio fp 0 and false negative rate fn 14 the low false positive rate is particularly important since mib should not detected without detection of the producer a high light extinction coefficient k 5 57 2 48 m 1 attributed to high turbidity loading in the river water lowered the subsurface water light intensity which could protect the low irradiance planktothrix from excessive solar radiation and allow them to grow throughout the summer the risk model shows that the probability of suffering unacceptable mib concentrations 15 ng l 1 in water is as high as 90 if the cell density of planktothrix is 609 0 cell ml 1 while the risk will be significantly reduced to 50 and 10 at cell densities of 37 5 cell ml 1 and 9 6 cell ml 1 respectively the approach developed in this study including the protocol for identification of potential producers and the risk model could provide a reference case for the management of source water

important features of drinking water quality and often ranks at the top among customer complaint call records dietrich and burlingame 2015 2 methylisoborneol mib with an odor threshold concentration as low as 10 15 ng l 1 is responsible for most earthy musty odor episodes in the northern hemisphere and has now been moving southward berglind et al 1983 izaguirre and taylor 2007 sun et al 2014 suurnäkki et al 2015 tsuchiya and matsumoto 1988 the removal of mib requires special treatments including powdered activated carbon adsorption or ozone oxidation resulting in increased treatment cost watson et al 2007 controlling the growth of mib producers in source water reservoirs lakes which could relieve the stress on water treatment is thus becoming an attractive approach su et al 2017 filamentous cyanobacteria including oscillatoria sp naes et al 1988 phormidium sp pseudanabaena sp planktothrix sp leptolyngbya bijugata wang et al 2015 and jaaginema geminatum tsuchiya and matsumoto 1988 have often been reported to be responsible for the production of mib in water sources the identification of mib producers in problematic reservoirs could benefit the understanding of their ecological niches driving forces and risk evaluation which is essential for the development of on site control techniques so far however identification of the mib producing cyanobacteria remains cumbersome it includes a procedure to isolate the possible strains followed by culture experiments to verify the production of mib recently quantitative real time pcr qpcr has been developed to detect the mib synthesis genes in water chiu et al 2016 giglio et al 2011 suurnäkki et al 2015 while the qpcr method has an advantage in providing important information regarding the mib production potential it cannot provide taxonomy information in addition most source water authorities normally do not have the professional experience and knowledge required for the isolation of mib producing cyanobacteria molecular based approaches and other advanced research level work however they have the resources to perform routine monitoring schemes which could provide comprehensive information regarding the phytoplankton community mib dynamics and some physico chemical parameters owing to mandatory regulations and or relatively low cost these routine data usually have the merit of high frequency up to weekly or even daily levels and being available for periods covering a long time scale in comparison with research based monitoring data it is thus possible to develop an approach to identify the possible mib producers and evaluate the risk of mib occurrences based on the existing dataset here a protocol based on pearson s product moment correlation analysis pearson 1895 combined with standardized data treatment and expert judgement was developed to sort out the mib producer s and a risk model using quantile regressions was established to evaluate the risk of mib occurrence an estuary drinking water reservoir qcs reservoir in the yangtze river was selected as the study object using its routine data on the phytoplankton community and mib dynamics over the period 2011 2016 this reservoir is the largest drinking water source for shanghai and has been suffering from mib problems since it was put into use in 2011 identification of mib producers and associated risk evaluation of mib occurrence have thus become increasingly important for the reservoir authority the mib producers and risks in qcs reservoir were subsequently determined and the reason for the mib producer s growth throughout the summer was also discussed this study makes it possible to uncover the source of odorants in drinking water reservoirs by using routine data by modeling the correlation between phytoplankton abundance and mib concentrations it can evaluate the risk of mib occurrences for management purpose meanwhile this study is the first work related to mib problems in qcs reservoir and can be regarded as exemplary research for use as a reference for source water authorities and water supply companies 2 methods 2 1 study area and sampling qcs reservoir located in the yangtze estuary is a new reservoir that receives water from the yangtze river and has been in use since 2011 the reservoir was built along the northern coast of an island with a maximum storage capacity of 437 5 gl and a surface area of 66 15 km2 two gates located in the northwest upper reach the main inlet and northeast lower reach as shown in fig 1 were designed to exchange freshwater and to prevent saltwater from entering the reservoir during the dry season the reservoir supplies water to waterworks through a water intake located at the end of the reservoir with a daily volume of approximately 2 5 gl d 1 before 2011 and 4 0 5 0 gl d 1 after 2012 it now serves as the main drinking water source for shanghai the bathymetry map shows that the water depth in the reservoir varies from 2 7 m in the upstream area to 12 1 m in the downstream area and an island in the upper section splits the water flow into two branches figure s1 the mean hydraulic retention time between april to september 21 3 to 23 8 days is much shorter than other months 47 6 to 124 1 days samples were collected over a period from 2011 to 2016 a total of 17 sampling sites were selected covering different regions of the reservoir fig 1 samples from 3 sites qc01 qc02 and qc09 had higher frequency up to 1 2 times per week since the whole reservoir is well mixed only surface water samples of approximately 2 l were taken using a kemmerer water sampler from below the water surface 0 5 m a detailed spatial survey was performed in june 10 2014 which involved 46 sites covering the whole reservoir figure s2 2 2 phytoplankton identification and physicochemical analysis subsamples 1000 ml for cell enumeration were preserved with 5 lugol s iodine sherr and sherr 1993 and left to settle for 48 h then pre concentrated 20 and kept in the dark until cell counting the identification of cyanobacterial species was carried out following komárek and anagnostidis 1998 and revised according to komarek et al 2014 the phytoplankton were identified and enumerated using an upright microscope olympus bx53 japan following the protocol established by utermöhl 1958 subsamples for determination of mib were stored in light blocking bottles with an airtight stopper the total mib concentration was measured and used to calculate the mib production potential 10 mg l 1 hgcl2 was added to the samples to prevent biodegradation li et al 2010 and they were analyzed within 72 h using the solid phase micro extraction spme method coupled with gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms agilent 6890 5975 agilent tech usa according to a procedure established based on liang et al 2005 and described in a previous study su et al 2015 physicochemical variables such as water temperature ph dissolved oxygen do turbidity and conductivity were measured in situ with a multi parameter probe exo2 us water transparency expressed as secchi depth sd was measured with a secchi disk diameter 20 cm black and white nutrient concentrations including nitrate nitrite ammonia total nitrogen tn and total phosphate tp were analyzed according to the national standard methods of china 2 3 identification of potential mib producers the odor threshold concentration otc of mib was adopted as 15 ng l 1 according to a previous study su et al 2015 in order to sort out the potential mib producers candidates based on the routine data a ranking protocol was developed and performed as below data smoothing consolidate the raw data points with shorter time units sampling interval t into groups with longer units grouping unit t t is recommended to be set to 4 t regarding the case study in qcs reservoir the grouping unit t of 4 weeks was used mib detection rate within each group calculate the proportion of the samples with a mib concentration higher than its otc 15 ng l 1 correlation test for each candidate perform a correlation test between their group level mean abundances and mib detection rate using pearson s product moment correlation test pearson 1895 with a correlation coefficient r and significance of the test p value respectively false positive rate fp the proportion of groups with candidate absent but mib detection rate high than 0 false negative rate fn the proportion of groups with candidate present but mib detection rate being 0 remove candidates with weak correlations find the candidates significantly positively correlated to mib detection rate e g r 0 3 p value 0 1 further find the candidates with low false positive rate e g fp 10 and low false negative rate e g fn 30 expert judgement since mib is mainly produced by several cyanobacterial genera in source water awwa 2010 most candidates can be removed from the list via expert judgement ranking sort the remain candidates according to the following rule ascending order of the sum of the false positive rate and false negative rate sum fp fn descending order of r ascending order of p value 2 4 risk model of mib occurrence and severity quantile regression between the mib concentration and a producer s cell density was performed to build a risk model for mib the false positive and false negative samples were discarded to minimize the measurement error the mib concentration c m i b units ng l 1 and cell density n unit cells ml 1 were firstly log transformed log 1 x and subsequently modeled according to eq 1 1 log 1 c m i b q u a n t i l e log 1 n τ n denotes the cell density of mib producer quantile is a function qr derived from the quantreg package koenker 2017 in r r core team 2017 τ 0 τ 1 denotes the quantiles to be estimated 10 25 50 75 and 90 of τ were selected for the quantile regression the risk of suffering mib problems is determined by the quantile regression model more specifically the quantile regression between the mib concentration and cell density at the τ quantile was used to assess the risk at the 1 τ level when the mib concentration was higher than otc hence the risk can be determined at a given cell density of a mib producer 2 5 statistical analysis and illustration all data analysis and illustration were performed using r 3 4 2 r core team 2017r core team 2017 data pretreatment and summary were performed using the dplyr wickham et al 2018 and base packages in r regression analysis including linear regression and generalized linear regression were performed using the stats package r core team 2017 quantile regression analysis was performed using the quantreg package koenker 2017 all figures were prepared using the ggplot2 package wickham 2016 the boundary of the reservoir was determined according to satellite images and performed in google earth https earth google com 3 results 3 1 limnology temporal distributions of the nutrients and other parameters during the study period are shown in table 1 the reservoir is in general well vertical mixed during all seasons according to the temperature profile figure s3 oxygen deficiency only occurred in the bottom layer 8 0 10 5 m in a very short period in august no significant differences in the nutrient concentrations were observed between all layers of the water column total n showed a clear decreasing pattern from 2 05 0 60 mg l 1 in february to 1 47 0 41 mg l 1 in september nitrate was the major component of nitrogen 85 4 9 5 with a concentration between 1 19 0 45 1 77 0 57 mg l 1 the ammonia concentrations remained low 0 05 0 02 mg l 1 to 0 14 0 12 mg l 1 high conductivity and chloride concentrations were observed in winter which is mainly attributed to saline intrusion the turbidity was 26 6 32 ntu on average exhibited a declining pattern along with water flow from upstream to downstream in the reservoir figure s4 as a result water transparency was rather low compared to other reservoirs such as miyun reservoir lake mathews table 3 with the minimum value of 38 22 cm in the upstream area and the maximum value of 100 15 cm in the downstream area the turbidity and water transparency expressed as secchi depth were highly related figure s2 3 2 phytoplankton ecological community dynamics a total of 323 species belonging to 147 genera and 8 phyla were detected in all samples from qcs reservoir cyanobacteria with 24 genera being detected mainly dominated in summer fig 2 as the major cyanobacteria in summer microcystis was present in 61 7 of summer samples july to october and 46 1 of all samples but no serious cyanobacterial bloom was observed during the investigation period several filamentous cyanobacterial genera including pseudanabaena dolichospermum formerly named anabaena aphanizomenon planktothrix formerly named oscillatoria phormidium and lyngbya were detected with a relatively high cell density and with strong seasonality figure s5 besides these merismopedia also exhibited a high cell density but was perhaps less important due to its small cell volume diatoms with 33 genera being detected dominated in the reservoir most of the time from middle november to the following june cyclotella was the dominant genus with a detection rate of 98 7 followed by aulacoseira 77 6 and skeletonema 56 7 in total 70 genera of green algae were detected with 40 3 of samples containing more than 15 genera suggesting it was an important member in the phytoplankton community the green algae exhibited a relatively high cell density in season transition periods may and november figure s6 scenedesmus and ankistrodesmus were the top two genera with the highest cell densities among green algae with a detection rate of 86 4 and 71 3 respectively another 19 genera belonging to cryptophyta 4 dinophyta 4 euglenophyta 6 chrysophyta 5 respectively were detected in all samples cryptophyta with a non negligible cell density exhibited a similar seasonal pattern as diatoms while the other phyla were present with much lower cell densities chroomonas and cryptomonas were the top two cryptophyta members with detection rate of 94 3 and 81 3 respectively 3 3 occurrence of mib the mib concentration exhibited drastic seasonal variations as shown in fig 3 the reservoir has experienced mib episodes since the first year of operation in 2011 no t o problems were recorded during january to april with mib concentrations of 2 5 5 4 ng l 1 48 quantile to 87 quantile increased mib concentrations were observed in may 3 0 17 1 ng l 1 and june 0 5 15 8 ng l 1 and serious mib problems could occur with low probability 312 6 ng l 1 at 99 quantile high levels of mib occurred in july 9 9 72 0 ng l 1 august 10 8 70 0 ng l 1 and september 19 6 70 0 ng l 1 with 26 0 32 4 and 45 2 of samples respectively exhibiting a concentration higher than the otc the highest concentration of 2528 ng l 1 was recorded on august 17 2011 then the mib concentration markedly decreased to 6 7 19 0 ng l 1 in october with only 9 2 samples exhibiting concentrations higher than the otc the mib problems ended in the following november and december with concentrations of 5 5 7 4 ng l 1 3 4 identification of potential mib producers a total of 32 candidates were obtained by removing the ones weakly correlated with the mib detection rate from the whole list r 0 3 p value 0 1 according to the ranking protocol table 2 among them 21 candidates were removed because of high fp 10 and 5 candidates were removed because of high fn 30 another 5 candidates were removed according to expert judgement more specifically planktothrix and phormidium are potential mib producers according to awwa 2010 and other studies izaguirre and taylor 1995 martin et al 1988 su et al 2015 suurnäkki et al 2015 tabachek and yurkowski 1976 with a false positive rate of 0 and a false negative rate of 14 planktothrix exhibited the lowest false rate false positive rate false negative rate though phormdium exhibited a high correlation coefficient of 0 661 with mib it had a false positive rate as high as 24 in fact another filamentous cyanobacteria pseudanabaena as a potential mib producer was also detected frequently detection rate 30 5 in this reservoir this genus was sorted out because of its high false positive rate 18 7 and low correlation coefficient r 0 0246 p 0 865 in addition the pseudanabaena strain was isolated from the reservoir but it was not able to produce mib in our culture test data not shown taking these aspects into consideration planktothrix with the lowest false positive rate acceptable correlation coefficient and most importantly a history of being responsible for mib episodes is thus regarded as the most likely mib producer in qcs reservoir during the period 2011 to 2016 further a correlation test between the planktothrix cell densities and mib concentrations of all samples raw data without data smoothing shows a strong positive correlation between them r 2 0 8001 p value 0 0001 n 865 providing more evidence that mib was mainly produced by planktothrix in this reservoir 4 discussion 4 1 identification of mib producer s using routine data mib problems have been widely observed in drinking water sources across the globe according to a comprehensive investigation of 77 source water samples from 34 major cities in china mib was present in 75 of them sun et al 2014 although plenty of monitoring data have been recorded little information is available on the mib producer s identification of mib producer s normally includes strain isolation purification culturing and confirmation of mib production in succession which is time consuming in addition isolation of mib producer s requires the operators to have sophisticated experience by comparison the approach developed in this study only requires routine data and therefore is suitable for the purpose of source water management data smoothing can remove random variation and so helps to reveal more clearly the underlying trend simonoff 2012 high variation in the data can be observed frequently when phytoplankton is quantified based on the microscopic technique hence a proper data smoothing process is important involving consolidating the raw data points with shorter time units sampling interval t into longer units grouping unit t here we test the effectiveness of the developed protocol under 10 scenarios with different data smoothing strategies more specifically different grouping units t ranging from the sampling interval t no data smoothing to ten times the sampling interval 10 t were used for each scenario the variations in false positives fp false negatives fn and correlation coefficients r which are the main indicators for identifying mib producer s were obtained for each candidate under 10 scenarios as shown in fig 4 the false positive rate fp denotes that high mib concentrations were observed while the candidate species was not recorded thus the fp is a key parameter since mib should not be produced when mib producers are absent therefore we should strictly reject a hypothesis when the fp is too high e g 10 by contrast the false negative rate fn can be regarded as a less rigorous parameter since mib producer s may cease to produce mib under certain conditions and a higher threshold of fn is acceptable e g 30 fp and fn values are rather robust variables for determining the mib producer and planktothrix with low fp and low fn was ideally separated from other candidates in fact planktothrix is the only candidate that was selected in all scenarios in qcs reservoir while others were filtered out for at least one scenario table s1 the correlation coefficient r represents the degree of fitting between the mib concentration and abundance of a candidate species and should not be too small for the true candidate s planktothrix s r in qcs reservoir ranged from 0 421 to 0 721 so a threshold of r 0 3 should be acceptable for most cases by setting the threshold of fp 10 fn 30 and r 0 3 p 0 1 15 candidates were ranked in the top 10 for at least 1 scenario while planktothrix is the top candidate in all scenarios four genera including eudorina coelastrum schroederia and ulothrix were in second place and seven genera ranked in third place table s2 these top ranking candidates can potentially be the mib producers and expert judgement becomes essential to remove the most unlikely strains it has been reported that the major mib producers are filamentous cyanobacteria including 7 genera under oscillatoriales limnoraphis lyngbya oscillatoria phormidium kamptonema planktothricoides and planktothrix and 5 genera under synechococcales leptolyngbya nodosilinea pseudanabaena synechococcus and jaaginema and 3 other genera under nostocales and pleurocapsales awwa 2010 by combining these processes mib producer s can be effectively identified based on routine data furthermore we have verified this protocal in miyun reservoir planktothrix with lowest false positive rate fp and highest correlation coefficient r was identified as the mib producer table s3 which is identical to su et al 2015 although the protocol developed in this study is transferable to other studies the applications of protocol requires high quality routine data since the phytoplankton communities may change over a short period and the mib episodes may last for a period varying from only one week to several months a bi weekly sampling frequency is required to obtain persuasive results while a weekly or higher sampling frequency is highly recommended besides the thresholds of the three evaluation parameters including fp fn and r used within the protocol are also important their thresholds should be tested and adjusted according to the data quality 4 2 the reason for mib occurrence in summer the earthy odor caused by mib in reservoirs and lakes has been reported since the 1980s as summarized in table 3 mib was detected in lake mathews in september and october of 1980 with the highest concentration of 53 ng l 1 recorded in the end of september and oscillatoria curviceps identified as the main producer izaguirre et al 1982 a mib episode caused by pseudanabaena in castaic lake in september and october of 1993 was recorded by izaguirre and taylor 1998 lake kasumigaura has been reported to suffer frequent occurrences of mib episodes caused by phormidium tenue in the spring and autumn since 1989 sugiura et al 1998 sugiura and nakano 2000 more recently the occurrence of mib problems in feng shen reservoir producer s unidentified and miyun reservoir caused by planktothrix have also been reported su et al 2015 tung et al 2008 yu et al 2009 the mib episodes occurring in different regions in the world could be classified into two types according to the seasons in which they occur table 3 lake mathews lake kasumigaura castaic lake and miyun reservoir experienced mib problems mainly in spring or autumn seasons from april to may or from september to october but not in the summer period from july to august by contrast catfish ponds feng shen reservoir and qcs reservoir experienced continuous mib problems throughout the summer we speculate that the underwater light climate is the main driving force responsible for causing such a difference the reservoirs experiencing mib episodes in the summer period exhibited a relatively high extinction coefficient 4 77 while the others had a relatively low extinction coefficient 3 49 most of the mib producers in aquatic environments are filamentous cyanobacteria including oscillatoria sp naes et al 1988 phormidium sp pseudanabaena sp planktothrix sp leptolyngbya bijugata wang et al 2015 jaaginema geminatum tsuchiya and matsumoto 1988 because of their relatively large cellular projection area these filamentous strains are able to grow under relatively low irradiance conditions according to our previous model based on cellular morphology su et al 2014 in the water bodies with a low extinction coefficient some filamentous cyanobacteria would prefer to grow in spring or autumn to prevent inhibition from excessive solar radiation while in the environments with a high extinction coefficient some other filamentous cyanobacteria could grow even in the summer period because of the greatly weakened underwater light intensity thus the relatively high turbidity loading from the yangtze river figure s4 likely created the conditions for planktothrix to grow in summer in our previous study planktothrix grew in miyun reservoir with very low turbidity in september when the surface microcystis bloom faded away figure s4 su et al 2019 2015 no serious surface microcystis bloom was observed in qcs reservoir the lack of competitors for subsurface planktothrix in summer might also provide a benefit for the growth of planktothrix in summer it should be noted that the impact of environmental conditions on the growth of cyanobacteria is a complicated topic and more efforts are required to understand the behaviors of these filamentous cyanobacteria in different aquatic environment by comparing our two typical and well studied reservoirs miyun reservoir and qcs reservoir the latter with high turbidity loading from the yangtze river figure s4 reduced the subsurface water light intensity therefore the damage from summer radiation was significantly minimized or eliminated in addition no serious surface microcystis bloom was observed in qcs reservoir and the lack of competitors for subsurface planktothrix in summer could also benefit their growth 4 3 risk assessment of the occurrence of mib all 5 quantiles τ 10 25 50 75 and 90 of the quantile regression between planktothrix cell density and mib concentration exhibited positive correlations fig 5 according to this quantile regression model the cell density threshold of planktothrix at a given risk level of having an unacceptable mib concentration c mib otc otc 15 ng l 1 in the reservoir can be determined if the planktothrix cell density is higher than 9 6 cell ml 1 the risk of unacceptable mib will be higher than 10 1 τ and if the cell density increases to 37 5 cell ml 1 the risk will increase to 50 accordingly at a planktothrix cell density of 609 0 cell ml 1 the risk that the reservoir will suffer from mib problems will be very high 90 furthermore the risk of suffering mib problems can be assessed using a risk model based on the quantile regressions with the planktothrix cell density as the model input the model result in qcs reservoir is shown in the inset in fig 5 this risk assessment model is highly expected to be useful for handling mib problems especially for source water authorities the prediction by the model can be used for early warning as well as for the development of countermeasures although the model result is comparable with that for miyun reservoir su et al 2015 a site specific model is highly recommended since the complexity of site specific conditions is far beyond the model parameterization therefore the approach developed in this study including the protocol for the identification of potential mib producers and the model for risk assessment could possibly provide a reference case for managing source water with odor problems if the routine monitoring of phytoplankton and odorants is well organized in the reservoir 5 conclusion an approach was developed in this study for source water management regarding mib odor problems including a protocol for the identification of potential mib producers and model for risk assessment based on routine monitoring data of phytoplankton and odorants planktothrix was identified for the first time as the mib producer in qcs reservoir the occurrence of mib problems in the summer period might be associated with the relatively high turbidity carried by inlet river water according to risk assessment as high as 90 probability of unacceptable mib could occur if the cell
