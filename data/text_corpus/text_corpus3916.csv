19580,the fouling of ultrafiltration uf and nanofiltration nf membranes during the treatment of surface waters continues to be of concern and the particular role of natural organic matter nom requires further investigation in this study the effect of ph and surface charge on membrane fouling during the treatment of samples of a representative surface water hyde park recreational lake were evaluated together with the impact of pre ozonation while biopolymers in the surface water could be removed by the uf membrane smaller molecular weight mw fractions of nom were poorly removed confirming the importance of membrane pore size for nf membranes the removal of smaller mw fractions 800 da 10 kda was less than expected from their pore size however nearly all of the hydrophobic humic type substances could be removed by the hydrophilic nf membranes for all mw distributions greater than 90 the results indicated the importance of the charge and hydrophilic nature of the nom thus the hydrophilic nf membrane could remove the hydrophobic organic matter but not the hydrophilic substances increasing charge effects more negative zeta potentials with increasing solution ph were found to enhance organics removal and reduce fouling flux decline most likely through greater membrane surface repulsion pre ozonation of the surface water increased the hydrophilic fraction and anionic charge of nom and altered their size distributions this resulted in a decreased fouling less flux decline for the uf and smaller pore nf but a slight increase in fouling for the larger pore nf the differences in the nf behavior are believed to relate to the relative sizes of ozonated organic fractions and the nf pores a similar size of ozonated organic fractions and the nf pores causes

the pressure cell the ozone was generated from air and the combined ozone air flow bubbled through the solution for a specific time the aqueous ozone dose was determined by mass balance of the gaseous

hydrophobic organic components by fractionating the nom into three groups strongly hydrophobic organic matter adsorbed by dax 8 weakly hydrophobic or transphilic organic matter adsorbed by xad 4 and

order to achieve drinking water quality objectives such as minimizing the formation of disinfection by products therefore the separation of organic matter by different membranes was investigated in terms of changes in the mw distribution by sec and toc using the ha solution and surface water fig 1 for the ha solution there was little organic matter removal by the uf membrane filtration evident from the sec analysis while in contrast the nf 3 and nf 4 membranes removed almost all of the uv absorbing ha over the complete mw range with a slightly greater removal by the nf 4 as a consequence of its lower mw cutoff these results were confirmed by the toc results which showed a minor removal 10 by the uf membrane and near 90 removal by the nf membranes for the surface water the sec analysis indicated the presence of bio polymers mw 30 k da humic substances and other small mw organic matter while the uf membrane retained most of the bio polymers there was little removal of lower mw organic matter 10 k da as expected for the nf membranes there was extensive removal of organic matter across a wide mw range in marked contrast to the uf and the nf 4 achieved a substantially greater removal of organic matter in the mw range between 1 kda and 4 kda compared to the nf 3 membrane comparing the performance of the membranes for the two test waters little organic matter was removed by the uf membrane for both waters while the nf membranes were able to remove most of the organic material from the ha water but less of the organic matter 10 kda from the surface water also the results indicated a greater removal difference between the nf 3 and nf 4 membranes for the surface water than for the ha water the toc results also confirmed that less organic matter was removed by the nf membranes for the surface water than for the ha water comparing the two test waters it was evident that while the ha solution was mainly composed of hydrophobic components the surface water comprised substantial quantities of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances fig 1d overall the results showed that physical size mw is not the sole parameter that determines the removal of organic matter by membranes and that other characteristics are influential such as the molecular charge zeta potential and hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of the organic matter as little organic matter was removed by the uf membrane except biopolymers subsequent tests of water filtration were undertaken principally with the nf membranes 3 2 effect of ph and ozonation on the properties of organic matter the variation of the zeta potential of the ha solution and surface water at different ph values and with ozone oxidation surface water were determined in order to investigate the mechanism of charge interaction between the organic matter and membrane and hence the potential for fouling the results showed that the zeta potential of both waters decreased with increasing ph fig 2 a comparing the results of the ha solution and surface water it was clear that the zeta potential of the ha solution was substantially more negative than that of surface water and decreased more markedly with ph reflecting the presence of dissociating carboxylic and phenolic groups associated with the ha macromolecules also the addition of ozone fig 2b decreased the zeta potential more negative of the hyde park organic matter by degrading or modifying organic matter through changes to their folding ability and tertiary structures and increasing carboxylic acid groups hammes et al 2006 in principle decreasing the zeta potential of nom should enhance electrostatic repulsion between the organic matter and the membrane surface du et al 2009 thereby reducing fouling as well as the zeta potential surface charge of the organic matter other physico chemical properties are also important such as the presence and quantity of hydrophilic and hydrophobic components the results showed that the proportion of hydrophobic components within the organic matter decreased with increasing ozone dose fig 2b in contrast the hydrophilic and weakly hydrophobic organic components increased with ozone dose ozonation of nom is known to attack carbon carbon double bonds e g in aromatic structures and form low mw compounds such as aldehydes ketones and carboxylic acids van geluwe et al 2011a which is consistent with the observed conversion of hydrophobic to hydrophilic substances 3 3 effect of ph on membrane performance and fouling the variation of nf membrane flux at different ph conditions was explored for both the ha solution and surface water fig 3 the initial flux of the nf 3 membrane 1 kda and nf 4 membrane 800 da with ha solution decreased as ph increased at all ph conditions the membrane flux decreased with filtration time but for the ha solution the decrease was less than 12 j j0 after 1600 s as ha is generally hydrophobic in nature fig 1d it was expected that ha solution would cause little membrane fouling for the hydrophilic pes nf membrane the greatest decrease of flux for both nf 3 and nf 4 membranes occurred at ph 5 and the flux decline diminished systematically with increasing ph 7 and 9 for the filtration of surface water the initial flux of surface water also decreased as the ph value increased from 5 to 9 for both nf 3 and nf 4 membrane as found with the ha solution the greatest membrane fouling for the surface water was at ph 5 compared to ph 7 and ph 9 which may be a consequence of the lower repulsive force between organic matter and membrane at ph 5 the greater decrease of j j0 in the case of surface water compared to ha solution was probably related to the different characteristics and greater variety of organic matter yamamura et al 2007 size exclusion chromatography was used to further characterize the dissolved organic matter in terms of mw distribution before and after membrane filtration and in membrane backwash effluents for different ph conditions fig 4 the mw distributions displayed significant differences in the feed filtrate and backwash samples depending on ph lowering the feed water ph to 5 reduced the concentration of organic matter with mw between 2 kda 6 kda but there was little change in the presence of biopolymers fig 4a as expected there was a large reduction in organic matter between the influent feed water and permeate of the nf 3 membrane for both biopolymers 100 removal and humic substances 70 at all ph values the extent of the reduction and influence of ph was indicated by the presence of organic matter in the backwash effluent fig 4c it was evident that the mass of organic matter washed from the fouled nf 3 membrane increased with ph both for biopolymers and lower mw organic fractions which was probably related to charge effects increasing zeta potentials between the organic matter and membrane with higher ph leading to greater repulsive forces for the nf 4 membrane a greater extent of organic matter was removed from the surface influent water especially fractions corresponding to an apparent mw 2 kda compared to the nf 3 membrane fig 4b and d as observed with the nf 3 membrane more organic matter was removed from the nf 4 membrane at higher ph conditions during the backwash process including biopolymers and humic acid fractions fig 4e 3 4 effect of ozonation on membrane performance for surface water in order to investigate the impact of the ozonation on mitigating uf nf membrane fouling by surface water the variation of flux for the surface water pretreated with 0 mg l or 1 mg l ozone was determined fig 5 and figure s1 for the uf membrane without pre ozonation a substantial extent of pore blockage was expected owing to similar size of biopolymers and membrane pores and a corresponding severe flux decrease 82 was observed while the application of ozone to the surface water reduced the membrane fouling fig 5a however the decrease of flux was still substantial 70 for 300 ml permeate compared to 80 without ozone pre treatment this behavior was probably related to the decrease in biopolymer concentration as a consequence of degradation by ozone oxidation after backwash the flux immediately returned to its initial clean membrane value and similar flux declines were observed during the second filtration operation as found with the first filtration operation for the nf 3 membrane the results were markedly different to the uf and the addition of ozone had a slightly deleterious impact on relative flux j j0 decline fig 5b there was a much greater decrease of membrane flux 55 for 50 ml permeate with or without ozone compared to the uf membrane as expected with the much smaller pore size of the nf membrane in addition for the nf 3 membrane the ozone oxidation of the surface water most likely had two effects that resulted in a slight increase in the flux decline firstly an increase in the organic fractions having a mw near to the nf 3 membrane pore size and secondly an increase in the hydrophilic fraction of the organic matter which is easier to be removed however this did not appear to cause irreversible fouling thus after backwash the initial flux was fully recovered and the flux decline in the second filtration cycle was identical to the first cycle for the nf 4 membrane the extent of fouling was less than that of the nf 3 membrane in the absence of pre ozonation 35 for 50 ml permeate possibly because of a lower flux and ozone had a slightly beneficial effect with a dose of 1 mg l giving a corresponding flux decrease of 28 following backwashing the flux appeared to fully recover and the subsequent decline was identical to the first cycle since only two cycles were conducted in these tests it is unclear what effect the addition of ozone might have on the potential occurrence of irreversible membrane fouling in the long term and this will be considered in future studies in general with increasing ozone dose the presence of large bio polymers and smaller mw organic matter including humic substances decreased and the resulting impact on membrane flux is believed to be related to the changes in the nature of these organic matter such as zeta potential and hydrophobicity hydrophilicity fig 2 and mw distribution the impact of ozone on the mw distributions before and after membrane treatment is summarized in fig 6 whilst acknowledging that ozone may affect the uv absorbance of certain organic fractions it is clear from the results for the uf permeate fig 6b there was little change in the organic matter with apparent mw 10 kda but all the biopolymers were removed by the uf membrane as the membrane pore size of nf 3 was much smaller than the uf there appeared to be a corresponding increase in the removal of moderate to high mw organic matter 1 kda by the nf 3 membrane which was directly related to the ozone dose fig 6c these effects were also seen but to a greater extent with the nf 4 membrane as shown in fig 6d to further characterize the foulants the mw distributions of the organic substances in the samples from the membrane backwash were compared to the raw and filtrate water fig 7 including the cases with 0 mg l and 1 mg l ozone pre oxidation of the raw surface water from hyde park the results showed that without the addition of ozone most biopolymers were successfully removed from the uf membrane by the backwash but there was little removal of the smaller organic matter 10 kda indicating that biopolymers determined the uf membrane fouling at least the reversible form of fouling fig 7a similarly after pretreatment with 1 mg l o3 some biopolymers at a lower concentration were evident in the backwash water from the uf membrane fig 7b which were associated with the lower membrane fouling fig 5a pre ozonation also had little impact on the retention or adsorption of humic substances mw 10 kda on the membrane fig 7b for the nf 3 membrane the organic matter recovered from the backwash water contained both biopolymers and lower mw fractions 1 10 kda with the latter generally absent in the backwash water from the uf membrane since the size of the lower mw fractions present in the backwash was closer to the membrane pore size their collection on the membrane surface contributed to the greater membrane fouling than was found for the uf membrane with the addition of 1 mg l o3 although the amount of biopolymer was less than that without ozone the content of lower mw organic matter after backwash was similar which probably related to the same degree of nf 3 membrane fouling for the nf 4 membrane although there was a greater removal of organic matter in the 1 10 kda mw range compared to the nf 3 membrane the content of lower mw organic matter in the backwash waters was slightly greater however with the addition of ozone not only was there less biopolymer in the backwash water as also observed with nf 3 but the smaller mw organic fractions were also much less than without ozone which could explain the lower membrane fouling observed fig 5c the differences in the presence of organic matter in the backwash waters was most likely related to the membrane properties as the nf 3 membrane 15 2 2 8 contact angle was more hydrophilic than the nf 4 membrane 24 2 0 9 contact angle and more hydrophobic organic matter was adsorbed on the nf 4 membrane as the mw distributions of the organic matter in the uf and nf permeates for the first and second cycles were the same it was evident that the membrane pores were unchanging after the backwashing operation since these tests were limited to only two cycles further studies are recommended involving an extended period of continuous operation of the membranes in order to investigate the possible development of irreversible membrane fouling 4 conclusions in this study the effect of ph and surface charge on membrane fouling during the treatment of samples of a representative surface water were evaluated together with the impact of pre ozonation the results of the laboratory tests are summarized as follows 1 while biopolymers in the surface water were extensively removed by uf there was little removal of smaller mw fractions such as humic acids for the nf membranes the removal of smaller mw fractions 800 da 10 kda was less than expected as suggested by the membrane pore size for the surface water but there was a very high removal of organic matter from the ha solution 90 these results indicated the importance of other properties influencing the membrane separation such as the charge and hydrophilic nature of the nom 2 during the nf treatment of surface water a greater membrane fouling was found compared to the ha solution membrane fouling could be mitigated by increasing the ph value of the surface water or ha solution owing to increasing repulsive forces between organic matter and membrane surface and highlighting the role of charge effects in membrane separation 3 pre ozonation of the surface water systematically increased the hydrophilic fraction and anionic charge of nom and altered their size distributions for the uf membrane there was a corresponding increase in the flux systematically with ozone dose which was probably related to the decrease of biopolymers concentration as a consequence of ozone oxidation for the nf membranes the impact of ozone on membrane flux was different with a decreased fouling flux decline for the smaller pore nf but a slight increase in fouling for the larger pore nf this difference in the nf behavior is believed to relate to the relative sizes of the ozonated organic fractions and the nf pores 4 the results of the nf tests indicated that the size characteristics of the membrane pores were fully recovered after backwashing and there was no evidence of irreversible membrane fouling however further tests involving continuous long term operation of the nf membranes is recommended to investigate the occurrence and extent of irreversible membrane fouling acknowledgements this work was supported by the engineering and physical sciences research council in

process and the impact of changing water and nom properties on the mechanisms of fouling the fouling characteristics of the uf and nf membranes were studied by filtration of the surface hyde park water and ha solutions 10 mg l in each test the performance of the membrane was evaluated by recording the variation of normalized flux j j0 as a function of time where j0 is the initial membrane flux

detection sec uv254 can be used to identify biopolymers that are sensitive to uv absorbance as indicated by the apparent molecular weight mw distribution of uv active substances in the sample waters after 0 45 μm membrane filtration details of the equipment and method can be found in our previous paper yu et al 2015 in summary sec was performed using a biosep sec s3000 column phenomenex uk 7 8 mm 300 mm as well as a security guard column fixed with a gfc 3000 disc 4 mm id a solution of 10 mm sodium acetate aldrich usa was used as the mobile phase analysis using high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec was achieved by the hplc system perkin elmer usa using the following instrumentation series 200 pump uv vis detector operated at a wavelength λ 254 nm and autosampler the flow rate was set at 1 ml min and the injection volume of water samples was 100 μl prior to operation the mobile phase was purged at a volumetric flow rate of 2 ml min in order to clear any residual and wash out the column of any contaminants polystyrene sulfonate pss standards american polymer standard corp u s of molecular weights 33500 14900 6530 and 1100 da were employed to calibrate the relationship between the mw and the retention time 2 4 xad 4 and dax 8 resins of superlite dax 8 supelco usa and amberlite xad 4 rohm and hass germany were used to analyze the hydrophilic and hydrophobic organic components by fractionating the nom into three groups strongly hydrophobic organic matter adsorbed by dax 8 weakly hydrophobic or transphilic organic matter adsorbed by xad 4 and hydrophilic organic matter non adsorbed by both resins according to previously established methods aiken et al 1992 wang et al 2009 2 5 other analytical methods sem images of membrane samples were obtained by a method where the samples were platinum coated by a sputter and observed under a high resolution field emission gun scanning electron microscope fegsem leo gemini 1525 germany the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration after 0 45 μm membrane filtration and zeta potential of water samples were determined using a total organic carbon toc analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan and zeta sizer instrument nano zs90 malvern instruments ltd uk respectively the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of the membranes was indicated by measuring their water contact angles using an automated goniometer model 590 with dropimage advanced software ramé hart instrument co usa 3 results 3 1 organic matter removal the removal of organic matter during water treatment processes is important in order to achieve drinking water quality objectives such as minimizing the formation of disinfection by products therefore the separation of organic matter by different membranes was investigated in terms of changes in the mw distribution by sec and toc using the ha solution and surface water fig 1 for the ha solution there was little organic matter removal by the uf membrane filtration evident from the sec analysis while in contrast the nf 3 and nf 4 membranes removed almost all of the uv absorbing ha over the complete mw range with a slightly greater removal by the nf 4 as a consequence of its lower mw cutoff these results were confirmed by the toc results which showed a minor removal 10 by the uf membrane and near 90 removal by the nf membranes for the surface water the sec analysis indicated the presence of bio polymers mw 30 k da humic substances and other small mw organic matter while the uf membrane retained most of the bio polymers there was little removal of lower mw organic matter 10 k da as expected for the nf membranes there was extensive removal of organic matter across a wide mw range in marked contrast to the uf and the nf 4 achieved a substantially greater removal of organic matter in the mw range between 1 kda and 4 kda compared to the nf 3 membrane comparing the performance of the membranes for the two test waters little organic matter was removed by the uf membrane for both waters while the nf membranes were able to remove most of the organic material from the ha water but less of the organic matter 10 kda from the surface water also the results indicated a greater removal difference between the nf 3 and nf 4 membranes for the surface water than for the ha water the toc results also confirmed that less organic matter was removed by the nf membranes for the surface water than for the ha water comparing the two test waters it was evident that while the ha solution was mainly composed of hydrophobic components the surface water comprised substantial quantities of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances fig 1d overall the results showed that physical size mw is not the sole parameter that determines the removal of organic matter by membranes and that other characteristics are influential such as the molecular charge zeta potential and hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of the organic matter as little organic matter was removed by the uf membrane except biopolymers subsequent tests of water filtration were undertaken principally with the nf membranes 3 2 effect of ph and ozonation on the properties of organic matter the variation of the zeta potential of the ha solution and surface water at different ph values and with ozone oxidation surface water were determined in order to investigate the mechanism of charge interaction between the organic matter and membrane and hence the potential for fouling the results showed that the zeta potential of both waters decreased with increasing ph fig 2 a comparing the results of the ha solution and surface water it was clear that the zeta potential of the ha solution was substantially more negative than that of surface water and decreased more markedly with ph reflecting the presence of dissociating carboxylic and phenolic groups associated with the ha macromolecules also the addition of ozone fig 2b decreased the zeta potential more negative of the hyde park organic matter by degrading or modifying organic matter through changes to their folding ability and tertiary structures and increasing carboxylic acid groups hammes et al 2006 in principle decreasing the zeta potential of nom should enhance electrostatic repulsion between the organic matter and the membrane surface du et al 2009 thereby reducing fouling as well as the zeta potential surface charge of the organic matter other physico chemical properties are also important such as the presence and quantity of hydrophilic and hydrophobic components the results showed that the proportion of hydrophobic components within the organic matter decreased with increasing ozone dose fig 2b in contrast the hydrophilic and weakly hydrophobic organic components increased with ozone dose ozonation of nom is known to attack carbon carbon double bonds e g in aromatic structures and form low mw compounds such as aldehydes ketones and carboxylic acids van geluwe et al 2011a which is consistent with the observed conversion of hydrophobic to hydrophilic substances 3 3 effect of ph on membrane performance and fouling the variation of nf membrane flux at different ph conditions was explored for both the ha solution and surface water fig 3 the initial flux of the nf 3 membrane 1 kda and nf 4 membrane 800 da with ha solution decreased as ph increased at all ph conditions the membrane flux decreased with filtration time but for the ha solution the decrease was less than 12 j j0 after 1600 s as ha is generally hydrophobic in nature fig 1d it was expected that ha solution would cause little membrane fouling for the hydrophilic pes nf membrane the greatest decrease of flux for both nf 3 and nf 4 membranes occurred at ph 5 and the flux decline diminished systematically with increasing ph 7 and 9 for the filtration of surface water the initial flux of surface water also decreased as the ph value increased from 5 to 9 for both nf 3 and nf 4 membrane as found with the ha solution the greatest membrane fouling for the surface water was at ph 5 compared to ph 7 and ph 9 which may be a consequence of the lower repulsive force between organic matter and membrane at ph 5 the greater decrease of j j0 in the case of surface water compared to ha solution was probably related to the different characteristics and greater variety of organic matter yamamura et al 2007 size exclusion chromatography was used to further characterize the dissolved organic matter in terms of mw distribution before and after membrane filtration and in membrane backwash effluents for different ph conditions fig 4 the mw distributions displayed significant differences in the feed filtrate and backwash samples depending on ph lowering the feed water ph to 5 reduced the concentration of organic matter with mw between 2 kda 6 kda but there was little change in the presence of biopolymers fig 4a as expected there was a large reduction in organic matter between the influent feed water and permeate of the nf 3 membrane for both biopolymers 100 removal and humic substances 70 at all ph values the extent of the reduction and influence of ph was indicated by the presence of organic matter in the backwash effluent fig 4c it was evident that the mass of organic matter washed from the fouled nf 3 membrane increased with ph both for biopolymers and lower mw organic fractions which was probably related to charge effects increasing zeta potentials between the organic matter and membrane with higher ph leading to greater repulsive forces for the nf 4 membrane a greater extent of organic matter was removed from the surface influent water especially fractions corresponding to an apparent mw 2 kda compared to the nf 3 membrane fig 4b and d as observed with the nf 3 membrane more organic matter was removed from the nf 4 membrane at higher ph conditions during the backwash process including biopolymers and humic acid fractions fig 4e 3 4 effect of ozonation on membrane performance for surface water in order to investigate the impact of the ozonation on mitigating uf nf membrane fouling by surface water the variation of flux for the surface water pretreated with 0 mg l or 1 mg l ozone was determined fig 5 and figure s1 for the uf membrane without pre ozonation a substantial extent of pore blockage was expected owing to similar size of biopolymers and membrane pores and a corresponding severe flux decrease 82 was observed while the application of ozone to the surface water reduced the membrane fouling fig 5a however the decrease of flux was still substantial 70 for 300 ml permeate compared to 80 without ozone pre treatment this behavior was probably related to the decrease in biopolymer concentration as a consequence of degradation by ozone oxidation after backwash the flux immediately returned to its initial clean membrane value and similar flux declines were observed during the second filtration operation as found with the first filtration operation for the nf 3 membrane the results were markedly different to the uf and the addition of ozone had a slightly deleterious impact on relative flux j j0 decline fig 5b there was a much greater decrease of membrane flux 55 for 50 ml permeate with or without ozone compared to the uf membrane as expected with the much smaller pore size of the nf membrane in addition for the nf 3 membrane the ozone oxidation of the surface water most likely had two effects that resulted in a slight increase in the flux decline firstly an increase in the organic fractions having a mw near to the nf 3 membrane pore size and secondly an increase in the hydrophilic fraction of the organic matter which is easier to be removed however this did not appear to cause irreversible fouling thus after backwash the initial flux was fully recovered and the flux decline in the second filtration cycle was identical to the first cycle for the nf 4 membrane the extent of fouling was less than that of the nf 3 membrane in the absence of pre ozonation 35 for 50 ml permeate possibly because of a lower flux and ozone had a slightly beneficial effect with a dose of 1 mg l giving a corresponding flux decrease of 28 following backwashing the flux appeared to fully recover and the subsequent decline was identical to the first cycle since only two cycles were conducted in these tests it is unclear what effect the addition of ozone might have on the potential occurrence of irreversible membrane fouling in the long term and this will be considered in future studies in general with increasing ozone dose the presence of large bio polymers and smaller mw organic matter including humic substances decreased and the resulting impact on membrane flux is believed to be related to the changes in the nature of these organic matter such as zeta potential and hydrophobicity hydrophilicity fig 2 and mw distribution the impact of ozone on the mw distributions before and after membrane treatment is summarized in fig 6 whilst acknowledging that ozone may affect the uv absorbance of certain organic fractions it is clear from the results for the uf permeate fig 6b there was little change in the organic matter with apparent mw 10 kda but all the biopolymers were removed by the uf membrane as the membrane pore size of nf 3 was much smaller than the uf there appeared to be a corresponding increase in the removal of moderate to high mw organic matter 1 kda by the nf 3 membrane which was directly related to the ozone dose fig 6c these effects were also seen but to a greater extent with the nf 4 membrane as shown in fig 6d to further characterize the foulants the mw distributions of the organic substances in the samples from the membrane backwash were compared to the raw and filtrate water fig 7 including the cases with 0 mg l and 1 mg l ozone pre oxidation of the raw surface water from hyde park the results showed that without the addition of ozone most biopolymers were successfully removed from the uf membrane by the backwash but there was little removal of the smaller organic matter 10 kda indicating that biopolymers determined the uf membrane fouling at least the reversible form of fouling fig 7a similarly after pretreatment with 1 mg l o3 some biopolymers at a lower concentration were evident in the backwash water from the uf membrane fig 7b which were associated with the lower membrane fouling fig 5a pre ozonation also had little impact on the retention or adsorption of humic substances mw 10 kda on the membrane fig 7b for the nf 3 membrane the organic matter recovered from the backwash water contained both biopolymers and lower mw fractions 1 10 kda with the latter generally absent in the backwash water from the uf membrane since the size of the lower mw fractions present in the backwash was closer to the membrane pore size their collection on the membrane surface contributed to the greater membrane fouling than was found for the uf membrane with the addition of 1 mg l o3 although the amount of biopolymer was less than that without ozone the content of lower mw organic matter after backwash was similar which probably related to the same degree of nf 3 membrane fouling for the nf 4 membrane although there was a greater removal of organic matter in the 1 10 kda mw range compared to the nf 3 membrane the content of lower mw organic matter in the backwash waters was slightly greater however with the addition of ozone not only was there less biopolymer in the backwash water as also observed with nf 3 but the smaller mw organic fractions were also much less than without ozone which could explain the lower membrane fouling observed fig 5c the differences in the presence of organic matter in the backwash waters was most likely related to the membrane properties as the nf 3 membrane 15 2 2 8 contact angle was more hydrophilic than the nf 4 membrane 24 2 0 9 contact angle and more hydrophobic organic matter was adsorbed on the nf 4 membrane as the mw distributions of the organic matter in the uf and nf permeates for the first and second cycles were the same it was evident that the membrane pores were unchanging after the backwashing operation since these tests were limited to only two cycles further studies are recommended involving an extended period of continuous operation of the membranes in order to investigate the possible development of irreversible membrane fouling 4 conclusions in this study the effect of ph and surface charge on membrane fouling during the treatment of samples of a representative surface water were evaluated together with the impact of pre ozonation the results of the laboratory tests are summarized as follows 1 while biopolymers in the surface water were extensively removed by uf there was little removal of smaller mw fractions such as humic acids for the nf membranes the removal of smaller mw fractions 800 da 10 kda was less than expected as suggested by the membrane pore size for the surface water but there was a very high removal of organic matter from the ha solution 90 these results indicated the importance of other properties influencing the membrane separation such as the charge and hydrophilic nature of the nom 2 during the nf treatment of surface water a greater membrane fouling was found compared to the ha solution membrane fouling could be mitigated by increasing the ph value of the surface water or ha solution owing to increasing repulsive forces between organic matter and membrane surface and highlighting the role of charge effects in membrane separation 3 pre ozonation of the surface water systematically increased the hydrophilic fraction and anionic charge of nom and altered their size distributions for the uf membrane there was a corresponding increase in the flux systematically with ozone dose which was probably related to the decrease of biopolymers concentration as a consequence of ozone oxidation for the nf membranes the impact of ozone on membrane flux was different with a decreased fouling flux decline for the smaller pore nf but a slight increase in fouling for the larger pore nf this difference in the nf behavior is believed to relate to the relative sizes of the ozonated organic fractions and the nf pores 4 the results of the nf tests indicated that the size characteristics of the membrane pores were fully recovered after backwashing and there was no evidence of irreversible membrane fouling however further tests involving continuous long term operation of the nf membranes is recommended to investigate the occurrence and extent of irreversible membrane fouling acknowledgements this work was supported by the engineering and physical sciences research council in

19581,the feasibility of ammonia pre separation during the thermal alkaline pretreatment tap of waste activated sludge was evaluated to mitigate ammonia inhibition during high solid anaerobic digestion hsad the results showed that the tap increased the organics hydrolysis rate as much as 77 compared to the thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp the production and separation of the ammonia during the tap exhibited a linear relationship with the hydrolysis of organics and the emerson model the pre separation ratio of the free ammonia nitrogen exceeded 98 00 at a lime dosage exceeding 0 021 g cao g ts however the separation ratio of the total ammonia nitrogen tan was hindered by its production ratio compared to the thp the tap increased the methane production rate under similar production yield a mass flow analysis indicated that the tap hsad process reduced the volume of the digester compared to the thp hsad process and the recirculated hsad tap process recovered 45 of the nitrogen in the waste activated sludge graphical abstract image 1 keywords waste activated sludge thermal alkaline pretreatment high solid anaerobic digestion hydrolysis kinetics ammonia pre separation 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is a by product of wastewater treatment in wastewater treatment plants wwtp and has to be treated sufficiently to prevent environmental pollution the production of was reached 55 million tons 80 water content in 2014 and is still increasing liu et al 2017 however approximately 80 of was is not anaerobically digested in china dai et al 2013 anaerobic digestion ad which is the biochemical process to remove organic components in sludge and produces methane has been widely applied in wwtp to stabilize the was jiang et al 2014 high solid ad hsad in which the solids content of the raw sludge exceeds 10 to decrease the volume of digester and energy consumption significantly is a promising process for improving the conventional ad dai et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 as the solids content of the was increases the anaerobic biodegradation process is hindered by the hydrolysis of organics and ammonia inhibition appels et al 2008 rajagopal et al 2013 a thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp is the most widespread technology for ad pretreatment because it degrades the cell walls effectively and renders the sludge more amenable to ad barber 2016 li and noike 1992 ometto et al 2014 zhen et al 2017 however the concentration of free ammonia nitrogen fan which is the main inhibitor wang et al 2016 during hsad can easily exceed a threshold 0 6 gfan l duan et al 2012 li et al 2017b fan is influenced by temperature total ammonia nitrogen tan concentration and ph and those factors tend to be fixed values under stable ad operating conditions therefore it is difficult to control the fan concentration during hsad in light of the concerns regarding ammonia inhibition during thp hsad various attempts have been proposed to mitigate the ammonia inhibition by controlling the tan concentration horttanainen et al 2017 evaluated the potential for ammonia recovery from dewatered sludge during thermal drying yao et al 2017 investigated simultaneous ammonia stripping and ad for treating dairy manure at high solids concentration these studies indicated that the conversion of the tan to ammonia gas might be a promising approach to reduce the tan concentration the emerson model emerson et al 1975 states that the tan tends to consist of fan at high temperatures and high ph therefore due to the requirements of high ph and temperature the thermal alkaline pretreatment tap of the was provides the opportunity to control the fan concentration with ammonia pre separation via the release of the exhaust gas the conventional tap of sludge is a closed system in which the produced fan is dissolved in the sludge after cooling down by releasing the exhaust gas and opening the vessel after heating is completed the cooling process of the tap has been modified to an evaporation system or ammonia stripping process thus the fan produced by the tap cannot dissolve in the sludge which means the pre separation of the fan during the hsad can be achieved as a result the tap provides the conditions required to convert the tan to ammonia gas the characteristics of the tap of was have been widely investigated in recent years li et al 2016 reported that a tap reduced the energy consumption and increased the methane yields carrère et al 2010 determined that the temperature was lower for the tap 120 130 c than for the thp 170 c at similar methane production performance xiang et al 2017 explained the relationships among the hydrolysis rate constant the temperature and the ph during the tap of was li et al 2017a reported that the tap ad process achieved self sufficiency of energy with proper lime dosage in summary the hydrolysis of organics in sludge using a tap has been widely investigated however the process of the production and phase conversion of the tan during the tap has not been described to date and the feasibility of the tan separation by the tap is unknown the feasibility of the tan pre separation during the tap was determined with the goal of mitigating the ammonia inhibition in a thp hsad process the hydrolysis of organics as well as the tan production and separation during the tap which are chemical domination processes are described by kinetic analyses and by investigating different duration times and lime dosages in addition the ability to pre separate the tan by the tap was evaluated furthermore the combination of the tap ammonia pre separation and the hsad is investigated using mass flow calculations 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge sampling and characterization the high solid was was obtained from the 4th wwtp in xi an which uses an anaerobic anoxic oxic a2 o process the solids content of the was was adjusted to 12 5 by dewatering and it was stored at 4 c in the laboratory prior to analysis the characteristics of the high solid was are listed in table 1 2 2 tap device the tap device was a vertical heating pressure steam sterilizer shanghai shenan medical

container was checked and the steam sterilizer was sealed the steam sterilizer was heated to the desired temperature 120 c and the duration time 30 min 60 min 90 min 120 min and 150 min to reach the temperature was recorded when the duration time was reached the set value the exhausted gas was released and the heating was stopped finally the steam sterilizer was allowed to cool naturally with the vessel being open and the sludge was stored at 4 c 2 3 batch test of ad biochemical methane potential bmp tests were conducted to evaluate the influence of the pretreatment on the ad of the sludge the bmp reactors consisted of a shaking incubator maintained at 35 1 c 120 rpm and 100 ml detest oxygen bottles the inoculum sludge was obtained from a lab scale mesophilic ad reactor 10 0 solid content

of variance anova at the 0 05 significance level was used microsoft excel and ibm spss statistics 24 were used to determine the p value and pearson correlation coefficient respectively 2 5 kinetic analysis the separation of tan during tap could be described as following steps influence of lime on ph hydrolysis of organics production of tan conversion of tan to fan and separation of fan the kinetic analysis of organic hydrolysis and tan pre separation was carried out basing on following principles a custom equation was used to describe the effect of lime on oh concentration first order relationship could be used to describe the hydrolysis of organics during thermal pretreatment luo et al 2012 xiang et al 2017 an arrhenius type equation was used to describe the effect of ph on the hydrolysis of organics with regard to the influence of the temperature on the thermal hydrolysis farno et al 2014 2015 liner relationship between the production of tan and hydrolysis of vss emerson model was used to describe the conversion of tan to fan emerson et al 1975 liner relationship between the production of fan and separation of fan kinetic analysis of results was performed using matlab 2016b 9 1 0 441655 the coefficients in the equations were determined by curve or surface fitting of data 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall performance of tap the optimization of the tap conditions was essential to determine the effects of the tap on the organic hydrolysis and tan pre separation after the tap a portion of the particulate organics in the sludge was converted into the liquor resulting in the acceleration of the ad process the characteristics of the sludge are listed in table 1 the tap had a significant effect on the organic hydrolysis the vss reduction ratio 1 vss vssraw and the pcod reduction ratio 1 pcod pcodraw were as high as 43 45 14 88 43 35 and 46 53 7 19 46 53 respectively the lime decreased the temperature required to reach a higher than 40 vss reduction ratio which is known to be achieved after 160 c thp after the pretreatment the concentration of the tn and po4 3 decreased a portion of the tan that was produced during tap was removed from the hydrolysate and a portion of the phosphate was removed and precipitated as calcium phosphate the statistical analysis of the phosphate concentration indicated that the lime had an influence p value 4 5 10 6 on phosphate meanwhile pretreatment time had no influence on phosphate p value 3 4 10 1 table 1 therefore the effects of the tap on the hydrolysis of organic the ammonia pre separation and the phosphate removal were confirmed 3 2 kinetics of organic hydrolysis during tap because protein is the main organic content in the was and the source of the tan chen et al 2018 the hydrolysis of organics is described before evaluating the tan production the lime had an influence p value 1 5 10 17 on ph meanwhile pretreatment time had on influence on ph p value 7 3 10 2 the effect of lime on the ph is the result of an increase in the oh concentration and the relationship between ph and lime dosage is described by eq 1 1 d c o h d c c a a c c a b where the c o h is the concentration of oh mol l c o h 0 is the initial concentration of oh mol l c c a is the concentration of lime mol l and a and b are correction factors after surface fitting fig 1 the coefficients a and b in eq 1 are 0 1916 and 0 9428 respectively during the tap the relationship between the oh concentration and the lime are described by eq 2 r2 0 843 2 c o h c o h 0 0 1916 0 9428 1 c c a 0 9428 1 the hydrolysis process of organics during the thp was assumed to obey a first order relationship eq 3 3 d c v s s d t k c v s s where k is the kinetic coefficient of the vss hydrolysis t is the pretreatment time min and cvss is the vss concentration g l for the tap the coefficient k in eq 3 has to be corrected for different ph values basing on arrhenius type equation eq 3 was revised to eq 4 to describe the influence of pretreatment time and lime dosage on the vss hydrolysis the correction of k is shown in eq 5 4 d c v s s d t k c v s s 5 k k a t a e e d p h where a d and e are correction coefficients for tap and cvss 0 is the initial vss concentration after fitting coefficients in eq 4 to the data listed in table 1 fitting surface shown in fig 2 the coefficients k a d and e were 0 2631 0 6271 132 7 and 1179 respectively after tap the vss concentration was calculated by eq 6 r2 0 639 6 c v s s c v s s 0 e 0 2631 0 6271 t 1 0 6271 e 1179 132 7 p h a similar approach was used to analyze the hydrolysis pcod after fitting the coefficients equation to the data shown in table 1 fitting surface shown in fig 2 the coefficients k a d and e were 0 2545 0 6271 132 7 and 1179 respectively during the tap the influence of the pcod on the ph and pretreatment time were calculated by eq 7 r2 0 758 7 c p c o d c p c o d 0 e 0 2545 0 6271 t 1 0 6271 e 1179 132 7 p h similar kinetic coefficient k values were observed for the pcod and vss for the same values of a d and e in eq 6 and 7 the theoretical value of vss pcod was 1 42 g cod g vss in the was c5h7no2 therefore the calculations of k were based on eq 6 to analyze the hydrolysis of the vss and pcod the ratios of k tap to k 0 thp were calculated to analyze the influence of the lime on the hydrolysis of organics fig 3 from the results obtained in fig 3 could be summarized that the dosage of lime could accelerate the hydrolysis of vss and pcod the hydrolysis rates of vss and pcod were increased 59 07 73 18 under experimental condition a hydrolysis rate increase of 0 05 g cao g ts observed at value of 81 of its threshold which means further increase of lime dosage has minimal effect on acceleration of vss and pcod hydrolysis above 0 05 g cao g ts these results indicated that 0 05 g cao g ts was the optimal lime dosage for the tap of the was 3 3 kinetics of production and separation of tan during tap the introduction of lime during the thp resulted in a conversion of the tan into fan under different experimental conditions table 1 based on the mechanism of ammonia pre separation the tan was separated in the following sequence tan was produced tan was converted to fan and the fan was separated therefore a kinetic analysis was performed to describe the transformation of the tan assuming that all elements are well distributed in the cell the biochemical production of tan during the tap is related to the decrease in the vss based on eq 6 which describes the hydrolysis of vss the coefficient θ was introduced to describe the tan production the fitting equation of tan is based on eq 6 considering that the lime can remove fan coefficient of removal r were added to the equation the results indicate that the pre separation of the tan during the tap occurs as follows 1 minimal pre separation ratio at a low ph ph 7 and 2 a significant pre separation at a high ph ph 8 the principle of the tan separation is to convert the tan to ammonia gas during the tap therefore r n can be described using a corrected emerson model eq 9 8 d c n h 4 n d t θ n 1 r n d c v s s d t 9 r n a 10 p h e 6285 120 273 15 10 p h because the thp without lime is a closed system the tn concentration is the same as that of the raw and the thermal pretreated sludge based on the average tn concentration in raw sludge the fan production and separation ratio can be calculated after fitting the equation of the surface fig 4 the θ n in eq 8 was 0 06826 r2 0 713 and the a in eq 9 was 0 9866 r2 0 788 10 c nh 4 n 0 06826 1 0 9866 10 p h e 6285 120 273 15 10 p h c vss 0 e 0 2631 0 6271 t 1 0 6271 e 1179 132 7 ph 1 in summary the tan concentration was calculated by eq 10 using the values for the coefficient θ n in eq 8 0 06826 g tan was produced and 1 g vss was hydrolyzed during the thp the coefficient θ n in eq 8 which describes the production rate of tan indicated that the deamination of amino acids and the hydrolysis of organics occurred simultaneously based on the concentrations of the vss and tn the tn in the sludge was 0 1012 g n g vss as a result 67 45 of tn in the sludge existed as tan because the r n in eq 9 is close to 100 under alkali conditions the tan produced by the tap could be separated effectively from the hydrolysate however the pre separation of the tan was hindered by the hydrolysis in which the organic nitrogen was the main component as a result the production and separation of the tan by the tap can be described as a linear relationship with the vss hydrolysis and the emerson model respectively the influence of the lime on the tan production and separation ratio during the tap was evaluated based on the coefficients determined from eq 8 and 9 and the results are shown in fig 5 the pre separation ratio of the tan exceeded 98 00 and at a lime dosage higher than 0 021 g cao g ts the separation ratio of the tan during the tap was 0 0669 g tan g vss the pre separation concentration of the tan was determined the initial vss and tan concentrations of the was were 76 30 g l and 7 72 g l respectively the tan tn ratio under hsad 10 solids content 20 d 35 1 c was approximately 50 the predicted tan concentrations of the digester were reduced from 3 86 g l for no pretreatment to 3 35 g l at 10 vss reduction 2 84 g l at 20 vss reduction 2 33 g l at 30 vss reduction and 1 82 g l at 40 vss reduction after the tap the maximum pre separation concentration of the tan was 2 042 g l under a pretreatment condition of 120 c 0 05 g cao g ts and 60 min the predicted vss hydrolysis ratio was 34 the tan separated concentration was 1 73 g l which means that 5 09 g caco3 l of alkalinity was removed from the anaerobic digester the decrease in the tan concentration as well as the decrease in the ph which occurred due to the decrease in alkalinity is promising for controlling the fan during digestion by controlling the tan with the tap the solids content of the hsad was increased because we evaluated the feasibility of fan pre separation to mitigate ammonia inhibition during hsad the recovery of ammonia gas which has great utilization advantages compared to nitrogen from denitrification and of heat were not considered in this research in future work the recovery of ammonia gas and heat based on evaporation concentration and heat exchange systems should be analyzed for use in chemical engineering and thermodynamics an evaluation of the exhaust gas recirculation on the process performance is needed to improve the tan recovery ability 3 4 influence of tap on methane production after a 20 d batch test of the ad the production and composition of the biogas were determined and were converted into methane production under standard temperature and pressure to describe the methane production capability of different samples the daily methane production was analyzed using a modified gompertz model eq 11 zhang et al 2017 zwietering et al 1990 11 m t m m a x e e r m a x e m m a x λ t 1 where the m t is the cumulative methane production n ml gvs mmax is the potential maximum methane yield nml gvs rmax is the maximum methane production rate n ml gvs d λ is the lag phase d and t is the duration of the bmp test d the coefficients in eq 11 were determined by daily methane production yield by curve fitting the mmax and rmax were calculated by separating inoculum sludge mmax 192 10 n ml gvsin rmax 16 06 n ml gvsin d such as mmax mmax mixture mmax inoculum the results were listed in table 2 the statistical analysis of rmax indicates that lime had an influence p value 4 98 10 2 on the maximum methane production rate meanwhile the pretreatment time had no influence on the maximum methane production rate p value 4 1 10 1 the rmax increased from 29 19 n ml g vsin d for the raw sludge to 45 55 16 73 n ml g vsin d for the thermal alkaline pretreated sludge which means that the anaerobic biodegradation rate of the sludge was increased effectively the mmax of the thermal alkaline pretreated sludge was 298 67 97 16 n ml g vsin which was similar to the mmax of the raw sludge 294 40 n ml g vsin according to the data from tables 1 and 2 the pearson correlation coefficients were 0 125 vss hydrolysis ratio and mmax 0 255 k k 0 and mmax and 0 130 tan concentration and mmax respectively lags of methane production were observed at a value of 0 20 g cao g ts the lags of methane production during bmp test may due to inhibition by ph or fan in general the effect of the tap on the sludge is an increase in the methane production rate under similar methane production yield 3 5 integration of tap with ad to reduce the volume of the digester and pretreatment reactor the following principles of application should be followed during the tap the organics in the sludge should be hydrolyzed sufficiently to accelerate the hsad process no significant negative effect on the methane production yield should occur during the hsad to achieve the bioenergy recovery the tan concentration should be reduced as much as possible to reduce the risk of ammonia inhibition the results of this study indicate that there are two approaches to integrate the tap and hsad which are the tap hsad and the recirculated hsad tap to evaluate the influence of the tap on the stability and volume of the anaerobic digester during the tap ad process a scenario simulation was carried out under a pretreatment condition of 120 c 0 05 g cao g ts and 60 min 50 of tn was converted to tan han et al 2017 the predicted concentration of the separated tan was 1 60 g l and the tan concentration in the digester decreased from 3 86 g l to 2 13 g l without calculating the effect of the tan decrease on the ph and setting the ph to 8 0 the fan concentration in the hsad digester decreased from 0 50 g l to 0 27 g l under mesophilic conditions and from 1 37 g l to 0 76 g l under thermophilic conditions therefore the stability of the hsad was increased a decrease in the tan resulted in a decrease in the volume of the digester or an increase in the solids content on the other hand a decrease in the tan concentration and the alkalinity of the digester has the potential to achieve a stable thermophilic hsad operation however an increase in the solids content of the was resulted in a decrease in the organic hydrolysis rate of the pretreatment and the decrease in the volume was less than 40 because the tap has the ability to separate the fan there is an alternative approach for the recovery of nitrogen during wastewater treatment to achieve the maximum recovery of ammonia gas the tan should be sufficiently converted prior to the tap therefore the ideal process consists of the sequence tap hsad tap to reduce the cost of the sludge treatment a recirculated hsad tap process is suggested we performed calculations to describe the evaluation of the cod and nitrogen content during the recirculated hsad tap process to simplify the calculation the process was divided into the hsad tap process and the sludge liquor process the parameters for simulating the process were 1 the mass of the raw sludge was 1000 m3 d and the solids content of the raw sludge and sludge cake were 12 and 40 2 vss tn and concentrations were listed in table 1 3 the concentrations of the vss and tn are listed in table 1 3 the biodegradation of the vss cod and tn during the hsad were synchronized 4 the scod and dissolved organic nitrogen were completely converted to methane and tan during the hsad respectively 5 the vss reductions of the hsad and tap of the raw sludge were set at 20 and 45 6 the methane concentration was 0 35 l g cod and the methane proportion in the biogas was 60 7 the recycle ratio of the recovered bioenergy in the liquor was 75 8 the cod and tn in the raw sludge occur only in the form of particulates the calculation results are shown in table 3 the results of the calculations indicate that over 44 of tn in the sludge was separated by the tap as ammonia gas providing a potential approach to recover nitrogen from was the tan concentration in the digester was 1 14 g l because the insufficient biodegradation of the was in the hsad and a large amount of the low tan content of the sludge liquor was recycled to the digester however the volume of the digester and pretreatment unit increased to 75 of the recirculated sludge liquor as table 3 shows the recirculation of the sludge liquor provided 47 16 of methane production yield and 6 68 of the amount of tan separation although the recirculation ratio was as high as 75 the cod in the sludge could not be recovered sufficiently but the tan separation amount was not influenced significantly by the recirculation ratio we can conclude that the recirculation of the sludge liquor during the hsad tap process helps to recover bioenergy in the was to evaluate the differences among the thp hsad tap hsad and recirculated hsad tap processes the digester volume biogas production yield and the tan concentration values were calculated the hrt of the hsad was 20 d and the solids content of the was during the tap hsad process and recirculated hsad tap process was 125 g l of 1000 m3 d the solids content of the was during the thp hsad process was 100 g l to reduce the risk of ammonia inhibition the calculation results are shown in fig 6 compared to the thp hsad process the tap hsad process reduced the digester volume by 20 however the digester volume of recirculated hsad tap increased 21 compared to thp hsad the methane production yields were identical for the thp hsad and tap hsad processes and decreased to 86 for the recirculated hsad tap process compared to the thp hsad process all tap based processes exhibited the ability to control the tan concentration in the digester the recirculated hsad tap process recovered 45 of the nitrogen in the sludge which was higher than the value for the tap hsad process therefore the tap hsad process reduced the volume of the digester and the recirculated hsad tap process achieve a sufficient recovery of nitrogen in the was 4 conclusions the influence of lime and pretreatment time on the hydrolysis of organics and ammonia pre separation during the tap was investigated in this research it was demonstrated that the tap resulted in an acceleration of the anaerobic biodegradation of organics and ammonia pre separation however the pre separation of tan was hindered by tan production rate during the pretreatment the tap hsad process is considered an alternative sludge treatment system in wwtp the recirculated hsad tap process provides a promising approach to recover nitrogen in an available form for further industrial use but requires further research and improvements prior to application acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china 51408458 the key projects of national water

19581,the feasibility of ammonia pre separation during the thermal alkaline pretreatment tap of waste activated sludge was evaluated to mitigate ammonia inhibition during high solid anaerobic digestion hsad the results showed that the tap increased the organics hydrolysis rate as much as 77 compared to the thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp the production and separation of the ammonia during the tap exhibited a linear relationship with the hydrolysis of organics and the emerson model the pre separation ratio of the free ammonia nitrogen exceeded 98 00 at a lime dosage exceeding 0 021 g cao g ts however the separation ratio of the total ammonia nitrogen tan was hindered by its production ratio compared to the thp the tap increased the methane production rate under similar production yield a mass flow analysis indicated that the tap hsad process reduced the volume of the digester compared to the thp hsad process and the recirculated hsad tap process recovered 45 of the nitrogen in the waste activated sludge graphical abstract image 1 keywords waste activated sludge thermal alkaline pretreatment high solid anaerobic digestion hydrolysis kinetics ammonia pre separation 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is a by product of wastewater treatment in wastewater treatment plants wwtp and has to be treated sufficiently to prevent environmental pollution the production of was reached 55 million tons 80 water content in 2014 and is still increasing liu et al 2017 however approximately 80 of was is not anaerobically digested in china dai et al 2013 anaerobic digestion ad which is the biochemical process to remove organic components in sludge and produces methane has been widely applied in wwtp to stabilize the was jiang et al 2014 high solid ad hsad in which the solids content of the raw sludge exceeds 10 to decrease the volume of digester and energy consumption significantly is a promising process for improving the conventional ad dai et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 as the solids content of the was increases the anaerobic biodegradation process is hindered by the hydrolysis of organics and ammonia inhibition appels et al 2008 rajagopal et al 2013 a thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp is the most widespread technology for ad pretreatment because it degrades the cell walls effectively and renders the sludge more amenable to ad barber 2016 li and noike 1992 ometto et al 2014 zhen et al 2017 however the concentration of free ammonia nitrogen fan which is the main inhibitor wang et al 2016 during hsad can easily exceed a threshold 0 6 gfan l duan et al 2012 li et al 2017b fan is influenced by temperature total ammonia nitrogen tan concentration and ph and those factors tend to be fixed values under stable ad operating conditions therefore it is difficult to control the fan concentration during hsad in light of the concerns regarding ammonia inhibition during thp hsad various attempts have been proposed to mitigate the ammonia inhibition by controlling the tan concentration horttanainen et al 2017 evaluated the potential for ammonia recovery from dewatered sludge during thermal drying yao et al 2017 investigated simultaneous ammonia stripping and ad for treating dairy manure at high solids concentration these studies indicated that the conversion of the tan to ammonia gas might be a promising approach to reduce the tan concentration the emerson model emerson et al 1975 states that the tan tends to consist of fan at high temperatures and high ph therefore due to the requirements of high ph and temperature the thermal alkaline pretreatment tap of the was provides the opportunity to control the fan concentration with ammonia pre separation via the release of the exhaust gas the conventional tap of sludge is a closed system in which the produced fan is dissolved in the sludge after cooling down by releasing the exhaust gas and opening the vessel after heating is completed the cooling process of the tap has been modified to an evaporation system or ammonia stripping process thus the fan produced by the tap cannot dissolve in the sludge which means the pre separation of the fan during the hsad can be achieved as a result the tap provides the conditions required to convert the tan to ammonia gas the characteristics of the tap of was have been widely investigated in recent years li et al 2016 reported that a tap reduced the energy consumption and increased the methane yields carrère et al 2010 determined that the temperature was lower for the tap 120 130 c than for the thp 170 c at similar methane production performance xiang et al 2017 explained the relationships among the hydrolysis rate constant the temperature and the ph during the tap of was li et al 2017a reported that the tap ad process achieved self sufficiency of energy with proper lime dosage in summary the hydrolysis of organics in sludge using a tap has been widely investigated however the process of the production and phase conversion of the tan during the tap has not been described to date and the feasibility of the tan separation by the tap is unknown the feasibility of the tan pre separation during the tap was determined with the goal of mitigating the ammonia inhibition in a thp hsad process the hydrolysis of organics as well as the tan production and separation during the tap which are chemical domination processes are described by kinetic analyses and by investigating different duration times and lime dosages in addition the ability to pre separate the tan by the tap was evaluated furthermore the combination of the tap ammonia pre separation and the hsad is investigated using mass flow calculations 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge sampling and characterization the high solid was was obtained from the 4th wwtp in xi an which uses an anaerobic anoxic oxic a2 o process the solids content of the was was adjusted to 12 5 by dewatering and it was stored at 4 c in the laboratory prior to analysis the characteristics of the high solid was are listed in table 1 2 2 tap device the tap device was a vertical heating pressure steam sterilizer shanghai shenan medical instrument factory ldzx 30kbs the pretreatment of the high solid sludge was conducted as follows the sample was 12 5 solid content was mixed with lime 0 00 gcao gts 0 05 gcao gts 0 10 gcao gts 0 15 gcao gts and 0 20 gcao gts the sample container of the steam sterilizer was filled with the sludge about 25 ml per container and placed into the steam sterilizer the level of pure water beneath the container was checked and the steam sterilizer was sealed the steam sterilizer was heated to the desired temperature 120 c and the duration time 30 min 60 min 90 min 120 min and 150 min to reach the temperature was recorded when the duration time was reached the set value the exhausted gas was released and the heating was stopped finally the steam sterilizer was allowed to cool naturally with the vessel being open and the sludge was stored at 4 c 2 3 batch test of ad biochemical methane potential bmp tests were conducted to evaluate the influence of the pretreatment on the ad of the sludge the bmp reactors consisted of a shaking incubator maintained at 35 1 c 120 rpm and 100 ml detest oxygen bottles the inoculum sludge was obtained from a lab scale mesophilic ad reactor 10 0 solid content hydraulic retention time hrt of 20 d stable for over 200 days and the inoculum to substrate ratio of bmp test was 3 gvs gvs the methane concentration in the biogas was measured and converted to methane production yield the duration of bmp test was 20 d the ph wasn t neutralized prior to the bmp test 2 4 analytical methods the analyses to characterize the sludge and biogas included ph volatile suspended solids vss chemical oxygen demand cod soluble cod scod tan total nitrogen tn dissolved tn stn and phosphate po4 3 the particulate cod pcod was calculated as cod scod vss tn stn tan po4 3 cod and scod were analyzed according to standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2005 ph was determined using a model phs 3c ph meter shanghai jingke corp china methane content was measured by gas chromatograph 3420a beifen corp china with a thermal conductivity detector tcd and a packed column tdx 01 3 mm 2 m wu et al 2016 for statistical analysis two way analysis of variance anova at the 0 05 significance level was used microsoft excel and ibm spss statistics 24 were used to determine the p value and pearson correlation coefficient respectively 2 5 kinetic analysis the separation of tan during tap could be described as following steps influence of lime on ph hydrolysis of organics production of tan conversion of tan to fan and separation of fan the kinetic analysis of organic hydrolysis and tan pre separation was carried out basing on following principles a custom equation was used to describe the effect of lime on oh concentration first order relationship could be used to describe the hydrolysis of organics during thermal pretreatment luo et al 2012 xiang et al 2017 an arrhenius type equation was used to describe the effect of ph on the hydrolysis of organics with regard to the influence of the temperature on the thermal hydrolysis farno et al 2014 2015 liner relationship between the production of tan and hydrolysis of vss emerson model was used to describe the conversion of tan to fan emerson et al 1975 liner relationship between the production of fan and separation of fan kinetic analysis of results was performed using matlab 2016b 9 1 0 441655 the coefficients in the equations were determined by curve or surface fitting of data 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall performance of tap the optimization of the tap conditions was essential to determine the effects of the tap on the organic hydrolysis and tan pre separation after the tap a portion of the particulate organics in the sludge was converted into the liquor resulting in the acceleration of the ad process the characteristics of the sludge are listed in table 1 the tap had a significant effect on the organic hydrolysis the vss reduction ratio 1 vss vssraw and the pcod reduction ratio 1 pcod pcodraw were as high as 43 45 14 88 43 35 and 46 53 7 19 46 53 respectively the lime decreased the temperature required to reach a higher than 40 vss reduction ratio which is known to be achieved after 160 c thp after the pretreatment the concentration of the tn and po4 3 decreased a portion of the tan that was produced during tap was removed from the hydrolysate and a portion of the phosphate was removed and precipitated as calcium phosphate the statistical analysis of the phosphate concentration indicated that the lime had an influence p value 4 5 10 6 on phosphate meanwhile pretreatment time had no influence on phosphate p value 3 4 10 1 table 1 therefore the effects of the tap on the hydrolysis of organic the ammonia pre separation and the phosphate removal were confirmed 3 2 kinetics of organic hydrolysis during tap because protein is the main organic content in the was and the source of the tan chen et al 2018 the hydrolysis of organics is described before evaluating the tan production the lime had an influence p value 1 5 10 17 on ph meanwhile pretreatment time had on influence on ph p value 7 3 10 2 the effect of lime on the ph is the result of an increase in the oh concentration and the relationship between ph and lime dosage is described by eq 1 1 d c o h d c c a a c c a b where the c o h is the concentration of oh mol l c o h 0 is the initial concentration of oh mol l c c a is the concentration of lime mol l and a and b are correction factors after surface fitting fig 1 the coefficients a and b in eq 1 are 0 1916 and 0 9428 respectively during the tap the relationship between the oh concentration and the lime are described by eq 2 r2 0 843 2 c o h c o h 0 0 1916 0 9428 1 c c a 0 9428 1 the hydrolysis process of organics during the thp was assumed to obey a first order relationship eq 3 3 d c v s s d t k c v s s where k is the kinetic coefficient of the vss hydrolysis t is the pretreatment time min and cvss is the vss concentration g l for the tap the coefficient k in eq 3 has to be corrected for different ph values basing on arrhenius type equation eq 3 was revised to eq 4 to describe the influence of pretreatment time and lime dosage on the vss hydrolysis the correction of k is shown in eq 5 4 d c v s s d t k c v s s 5 k k a t a e e d p h where a d and e are correction coefficients for tap and cvss 0 is the initial vss concentration after fitting coefficients in eq 4 to the data listed in table 1 fitting surface shown in fig 2 the coefficients k a d and e were 0 2631 0 6271 132 7 and 1179 respectively after tap the vss concentration was calculated by eq 6 r2 0 639 6 c v s s c v s s 0 e 0 2631 0 6271 t 1 0 6271 e 1179 132 7 p h a similar approach was used to analyze the hydrolysis pcod after fitting the coefficients equation to the data shown in table 1 fitting surface shown in fig 2 the coefficients k a d and e were 0 2545 0 6271 132 7 and 1179 respectively during the tap the influence of the pcod on the ph and pretreatment time were calculated by eq 7 r2 0 758 7 c p c o d c p c o d 0 e 0 2545 0 6271 t 1 0 6271 e 1179 132 7 p h similar kinetic coefficient k values were observed for the pcod and vss for the same values of a d and e in eq 6 and 7 the theoretical value of vss pcod was 1 42 g cod g vss in the was c5h7no2 therefore the calculations of k were based on eq 6 to analyze the hydrolysis of the vss and pcod the ratios of k tap to k 0 thp were calculated to analyze the influence of the lime on the hydrolysis of organics fig 3 from the results obtained in fig 3 could be summarized that the dosage of lime could accelerate the hydrolysis of vss and pcod the hydrolysis rates of vss and pcod were increased 59 07 73 18 under experimental condition a hydrolysis rate increase of 0 05 g cao g ts observed at value of 81 of its threshold which means further increase of lime dosage has minimal effect on acceleration of vss and pcod hydrolysis above 0 05 g cao g ts these results indicated that 0 05 g cao g ts was the optimal lime dosage for the tap of the was 3 3 kinetics of production and separation of tan during tap the introduction of lime during the thp resulted in a conversion of the tan into fan under different experimental conditions table 1 based on the mechanism of ammonia pre separation the tan was separated in the following sequence tan was produced tan was converted to fan and the fan was separated therefore a kinetic analysis was performed to describe the transformation of the tan assuming that all elements are well distributed in the cell the biochemical production of tan during the tap is related to the decrease in the vss based on eq 6 which describes the hydrolysis of vss the coefficient θ was introduced to describe the tan production the fitting equation of tan is based on eq 6 considering that the lime can remove fan coefficient of removal r were added to the equation the results indicate that the pre separation of the tan during the tap occurs as follows 1 minimal pre separation ratio at a low ph ph 7 and 2 a significant pre separation at a high ph ph 8 the principle of the tan separation is to convert the tan to ammonia gas during the tap therefore r n can be described using a corrected emerson model eq 9 8 d c n h 4 n d t θ n 1 r n d c v s s d t 9 r n a 10 p h e 6285 120 273 15 10 p h because the thp without lime is a closed system the tn concentration is the same as that of the raw and the thermal pretreated sludge based on the average tn concentration in raw sludge the fan production and separation ratio can be calculated after fitting the equation of the surface fig 4 the θ n in eq 8 was 0 06826 r2 0 713 and the a in eq 9 was 0 9866 r2 0 788 10 c nh 4 n 0 06826 1 0 9866 10 p h e 6285 120 273 15 10 p h c vss 0 e 0 2631 0 6271 t 1 0 6271 e 1179 132 7 ph 1 in summary the tan concentration was calculated by eq 10 using the values for the coefficient θ n in eq 8 0 06826 g tan was produced and 1 g vss was hydrolyzed during the thp the coefficient θ n in eq 8 which describes the production rate of tan indicated that the deamination of amino acids and the hydrolysis of organics occurred simultaneously based on the concentrations of the vss and tn the tn in the sludge was 0 1012 g n g vss as a result 67 45 of tn in the sludge existed as tan because the r n in eq 9 is close to 100 under alkali conditions the tan produced by the tap could be separated effectively from the hydrolysate however the pre separation of the tan was hindered by the hydrolysis in which the organic nitrogen was the main component as a result the production and separation of the tan by the tap can be described as a linear relationship with the vss hydrolysis and the emerson model respectively the influence of the lime on the tan production and separation ratio during the tap was evaluated based on the coefficients determined from eq 8 and 9 and the results are shown in fig 5 the pre separation ratio of the tan exceeded 98 00 and at a lime dosage higher than 0 021 g cao g ts the separation ratio of the tan during the tap was 0 0669 g tan g vss the pre separation concentration of the tan was determined the initial vss and tan concentrations of the was were 76 30 g l and 7 72 g l respectively the tan tn ratio under hsad 10 solids content 20 d 35 1 c was approximately 50 the predicted tan concentrations of the digester were reduced from 3 86 g l for no pretreatment to 3 35 g l at 10 vss reduction 2 84 g l at 20 vss reduction 2 33 g l at 30 vss reduction and 1 82 g l at 40 vss reduction after the tap the maximum pre separation concentration of the tan was 2 042 g l under a pretreatment condition of 120 c 0 05 g cao g ts and 60 min the predicted vss hydrolysis ratio was 34 the tan separated concentration was 1 73 g l which means that 5 09 g caco3 l of alkalinity was removed from the anaerobic digester the decrease in the tan concentration as well as the decrease in the ph which occurred due to the decrease in alkalinity is promising for controlling the fan during digestion by controlling the tan with the tap the solids content of the hsad was increased because we evaluated the feasibility of fan pre separation to mitigate ammonia inhibition during hsad the recovery of ammonia gas which has great utilization advantages compared to nitrogen from denitrification and of heat were not considered in this research in future work the recovery of ammonia gas and heat based on evaporation concentration and heat exchange systems should be analyzed for use in chemical engineering and thermodynamics an evaluation of the exhaust gas recirculation on the process performance is needed to improve the tan recovery ability 3 4 influence of tap on methane production after a 20 d batch test of the ad the production and composition of the biogas were determined and were converted into methane production under standard temperature and pressure to describe the methane production capability of different samples the daily methane production was analyzed using a modified gompertz model eq 11 zhang et al 2017 zwietering et al 1990 11 m t m m a x e e r m a x e m m a x λ t 1 where the m t is the cumulative methane production n ml gvs mmax is the potential maximum methane yield nml gvs rmax is the maximum methane production rate n ml gvs d λ is the lag phase d and t is the duration of the bmp test d the coefficients in eq 11 were determined by daily methane production yield by curve fitting the mmax and rmax were calculated by separating inoculum sludge mmax 192 10 n ml gvsin rmax 16 06 n ml gvsin d such as mmax mmax mixture mmax inoculum the results were listed in table 2 the statistical analysis of rmax indicates that lime had an influence p value 4 98 10 2 on the maximum methane production rate meanwhile the pretreatment time had no influence on the maximum methane production rate p value 4 1 10 1 the rmax increased from 29 19 n ml g vsin d for the raw sludge to 45 55 16 73 n ml g vsin d for the thermal alkaline pretreated sludge which means that the anaerobic biodegradation rate of the sludge was increased effectively the mmax of the thermal alkaline pretreated sludge was 298 67 97 16 n ml g vsin which was similar to the mmax of the raw sludge 294 40 n ml g vsin according to the data from tables 1 and 2 the pearson correlation coefficients were 0 125 vss hydrolysis ratio and mmax 0 255 k k 0 and mmax and 0 130 tan concentration and mmax respectively lags of methane production were observed at a value of 0 20 g cao g ts the lags of methane production during bmp test may due to inhibition by ph or fan in general the effect of the tap on the sludge is an increase in the methane production rate under similar methane production yield 3 5 integration of tap with ad to reduce the volume of the digester and pretreatment reactor the following principles of application should be followed during the tap the organics in the sludge should be hydrolyzed sufficiently to accelerate the hsad process no significant negative effect on the methane production yield should occur during the hsad to achieve the bioenergy recovery the tan concentration should be reduced as much as possible to reduce the risk of ammonia inhibition the results of this study indicate that there are two approaches to integrate the tap and hsad which are the tap hsad and the recirculated hsad tap to evaluate the influence of the tap on the stability and volume of the anaerobic digester during the tap ad process a scenario simulation was carried out under a pretreatment condition of 120 c 0 05 g cao g ts and 60 min 50 of tn was converted to tan han et al 2017 the predicted concentration of the separated tan was 1 60 g l and the tan concentration in the digester decreased from 3 86 g l to 2 13 g l without calculating the effect of the tan decrease on the ph and setting the ph to 8 0 the fan concentration in the hsad digester decreased from 0 50 g l to 0 27 g l under mesophilic conditions and from 1 37 g l to 0 76 g l under thermophilic conditions therefore the stability of the hsad was increased a decrease in the tan resulted in a decrease in the volume of the digester or an increase in the solids content on the other hand a decrease in the tan concentration and the alkalinity of the digester has the potential to achieve a stable thermophilic hsad operation however an increase in the solids content of the was resulted in a decrease in the organic hydrolysis rate of the pretreatment and the decrease in the volume was less than 40 because the tap has the ability to separate the fan there is an alternative approach for the recovery of nitrogen during wastewater treatment to achieve the maximum recovery of ammonia gas the tan should be sufficiently converted prior to the tap therefore the ideal process consists of the sequence tap hsad tap to reduce the cost of the sludge treatment a recirculated hsad tap process is suggested we performed calculations to describe the evaluation of the cod and nitrogen content during the recirculated hsad tap process to simplify the calculation the process was divided into the hsad tap process and the sludge liquor process the parameters for simulating the process were 1 the mass of the raw sludge was 1000 m3 d and the solids content of the raw sludge and sludge cake were 12 and 40 2 vss tn and concentrations were listed in table 1 3 the concentrations of the vss and tn are listed in table 1 3 the biodegradation of the vss cod and tn during the hsad were synchronized 4 the scod and dissolved organic nitrogen were completely converted to methane and tan during the hsad respectively 5 the vss reductions of the hsad and tap of the raw sludge were set at 20 and 45 6 the methane concentration was 0 35 l g cod and the methane proportion in the biogas was 60 7 the recycle ratio of the recovered bioenergy in the liquor was 75 8 the cod and tn in the raw sludge occur only in the form of particulates the calculation results are shown in table 3 the results of the calculations indicate that over 44 of tn in the sludge was separated by the tap as ammonia gas providing a potential approach to recover nitrogen from was the tan concentration in the digester was 1 14 g l because the insufficient biodegradation of the was in the hsad and a large amount of the low tan content of the sludge liquor was recycled to the digester however the volume of the digester and pretreatment unit increased to 75 of the recirculated sludge liquor as table 3 shows the recirculation of the sludge liquor provided 47 16 of methane production yield and 6 68 of the amount of tan separation although the recirculation ratio was as high as 75 the cod in the sludge could not be recovered sufficiently but the tan separation amount was not influenced significantly by the recirculation ratio we can conclude that the recirculation of the sludge liquor during the hsad tap process helps to recover bioenergy in the was to evaluate the differences among the thp hsad tap hsad and recirculated hsad tap processes the digester volume biogas production yield and the tan concentration values were calculated the hrt of the hsad was 20 d and the solids content of the was during the tap hsad process and recirculated hsad tap process was 125 g l of 1000 m3 d the solids content of the was during the thp hsad process was 100 g l to reduce the risk of ammonia inhibition the calculation results are shown in fig 6 compared to the thp hsad process the tap hsad process reduced the digester volume by 20 however the digester volume of recirculated hsad tap increased 21 compared to thp hsad the methane production yields were identical for the thp hsad and tap hsad processes and decreased to 86 for the recirculated hsad tap process compared to the thp hsad process all tap based processes exhibited the ability to control the tan concentration in the digester the recirculated hsad tap process recovered 45 of the nitrogen in the sludge which was higher than the value for the tap hsad process therefore the tap hsad process reduced the volume of the digester and the recirculated hsad tap process achieve a sufficient recovery of nitrogen in the was 4 conclusions the influence of lime and pretreatment time on the hydrolysis of organics and ammonia pre separation during the tap was investigated in this research it was demonstrated that the tap resulted in an acceleration of the anaerobic biodegradation of organics and ammonia pre separation however the pre separation of tan was hindered by tan production rate during the pretreatment the tap hsad process is considered an alternative sludge treatment system in wwtp the recirculated hsad tap process provides a promising approach to recover nitrogen in an available form for further industrial use but requires further research and improvements prior to application acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china 51408458 the key projects of national water

19582,the present study proposed and demonstrated a novel process for the bioconversion of syngas mainly co and h2 to valuable volatile fatty acids vfa by integrating with mesophilic alkaline fermentation of waste activated sludge was the results showed that although ph 9 was suitable for vfa production from was 62 5 of the consumed co was converted to methane due to the presence of hydrogenogenic pathway for co conversion the increase of ph from 9 to 9 5 inhibited the methane production from co because of the possible presence of only acetogenic pathway for co conversion however methane was still produced from h2 contained in syngas through hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and around 32 34 of the consumed syngas was converted to methane at both ph 9 and 9 5 methane was produced by hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanobacteriales further increase of ph to 10 effectively inhibited methane production from syngas and efficient vfa mainly acetate with the concentration of around 135 mm production by simultaneous conversion of syngas and was was achieved high acetate concentrations 150 mm were shown to have serious negative effects on the conversion of syngas the addition of syngas to the mesophilic alkaline fermentation of was at ph 10 not only resulted in the enrichment of some known bacteria related with syngas conversion but also changed the microbial community compositions for the fermentation of was graphical abstract image 1 keywords volatile fatty acids production waste activated sludge syngas mesophilic alkaline fermentation microbial community analysis 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is produced in huge quantities from municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps and anaerobic digestion has been widely used in wwtps as an effective sludge treatment and disposal technology to produce biogas li et al 2014 luo et al 2016 although biogas can be upgraded to natural gas the price of natural gas has dropped in recent years due to exploration of novel shale gas reservoirs kleerebezem et al 2015 alternative processes have been suggested to convert was into new resources e g volatile fatty acids vfa hydrogen bio oil and et al tyagi and lo 2013 the production of vfa via anaerobic fermentation of was has attracted much attention which can be used as commodity chemicals precursors for higher value compounds including alcohols long chain fatty acids and polyhydroxyalkanoates pha and readily biodegradable carbon sources for biological nutrients removal agler et al 2011 cagnetta et al 2016 li et al 2014 wu et al 2016 it was estimated that the revenue of pha production was more than 5 times higher than biogas production kleerebezem et al 2015 therefore vfa has higher value compared to biogas which will increase the overall economy to was bioconversion process there are some challenges regarding was bioconversion was is difficult to be biodegraded and therefore its hydrolysis has been recognized as the rate limiting step for anaerobic conversion neumann et al 2016 moreover when other products than biogas are in target from was such as vfa measures for inhibiting methanogens are required zhang et al 2009 previous studies showed that alkaline fermentation ph 8 10 of was for vfa production was promising since it could enhance the hydrolysis of was and at the same time inhibit methanogenesis to efficiently produce vfa li et al 2014 yuan et al 2006 zhang et al 2009 it should be noted that a significant amount around 60 of organics in was still could not be solubilized and biodegraded li et al 2014 yuan et al 2006 zhang et al 2009 and therefore remains in the effluents after anaerobic fermentation for vfa production the low degradation efficiency of was was also observed for biogas production feng et al 2014 luo et al 2013 via anaerobic digestion in fact there are many organic wastes e g lignocellulosic wastes and municipal solid wastes which are difficult to be biodegraded guiot et al 2011 zheng et al 2014 thermal gasification is an effective method for the conversion of non readily biodegradable organic wastes latif et al 2014 it involves high temperatures usually 600 900 c in the presence of oxidizing agents e g oxygen or steam resulting in the partial oxidation of the organic matter gasifying it to syngas with significant amounts of co h2 and co2 richardson et al 2012 syngas can be used as fuel in gas motors however the volumetric energy density of syngas is low which is only about 50 of natural gas guiot et al 2011 alternatively syngas can be metabolized by certain microorganisms and converted to valuable chemicals including acetate ethanol butyrate and et al latif et al 2014 clostridium ljungdahlii was found to be able to utilize co and h2 for acetate and ethanol production as early as in 1987 chen and henson 2016 and then more pure cultures within the genus clostridium were isolated for syngas fermentation köpke et al 2011 both clostridium ljungdahlii and clostridium ragsdalei have been well studied for their ability to produce vfa and ethanol from syngas el gammal et al 2017 mohammadi et al 2016 however most previous studies focused on syngas fermentation by pure cultures which require sterilized conditions syngas fermentation by mixed culture might be more promising considering the potential advantages including non sterilized conditions and utilization of wastewater as nutrients homoacetogenesis is a well known process for acetate production from h2 and co2 and has been shown in anaerobic fermentation process for organic wastes treatment luo et al 2011 saady 2013 a previous study also showed that other fatty acids e g butyrate caproate can be produced from h2 and co2 by anaerobic mixed culture in a hollow fiber membrane biofilm reactor zhang et al 2013 furthermore previous studies showed that anaerobic mixed sludge from biogas reactors can be used for co conversion and acetate was the main product guiot et al 2011 jing et al 2017 sipma et al 2003 as previously mentioned alkaline fermentation has been developed for vfa production from was and it also involves various microorganisms wan et al 2016 therefore a novel process for vfa production from syngas by integrating with mesophilic alkaline fermentation of was was proposed in the present study in our previous study we found that homoacetogenesis was occurring during mesophilic alkaline fermentation of was wan et al 2016 and therefore the present study mainly focused on the mesophilic alkaline fermentation for simultaneously vfa production from was and syngas there are several challenges in the new process remaining to be elucidated first although it was proved homoacetogenesis occurred under mesophilic alkaline condition wan et al 2016 it was still unknown whether co can be metabolized under such condition second h2 was known to affect the degradation of fatty acids e g propionate and butyrate and co was reported to be toxic for many microorganisms due to its high affinity to metal containing enzymes luo et al 2012 2013 and therefore it was crucial to reveal the effects of syngas addition on the degradation of was and the changes of microbial community compositions finally the addition of syngas to the anaerobic fermentation of was would increase the vfa concentration which might affect the conversion efficiency of syngas due to the inhibition from the products based on the above considerations the present study aimed to investigate the feasibility of vfa production by integrating mesophilic alkaline fermentation of was with syngas conversion moreover the effects of syngas addition on the reactor performances and microbial community compositions of mesophilic alkaline fermentation of was were elucidated 2 material and methods 2 1 was was was collected from a secondary sedimentation tank in quyang municipal wastewater treatment plant which is located in shanghai china the main characteristics of was were as follows total suspended solids tss 10 1 0 7 g l volatile suspended solids vss 7 8 0 6 g l ph 6 9 0 1 chemical oxygen demand cod 12 3 0 5 g l vfa 0 2 0 01 mm mainly acetate total proteins 6 8 0 3 g l and total carbohydrates 0 6 0 02 g l 2 2 set up of the reactors two 1 l continuously stirred tank reactors with working volume 0 6 l were used one reactor c was fed with only was without syngas as control and the other one s was fed with both was and syngas both reactors were continuously stirred by magnetic stirrers at a stirring speed of 200 rpm and the temperature was controlled at 37 c by thermal water jackets syngas was injected into reactor s through a gas diffuser by a peristaltic pump the gas leaving the reactors was collected in gasbags both reactors were operated at hrt of 8 days based on previous studies 2 8 by removing and feeding 75 ml was every day no inoculum was used for starting up the reactors alternatively both reactors were filled with raw was and were operated in batch mode under anaerobic conditions until the concentrations of vfa achieved maximum values mainly acetate and propionate with the approximately maximum concentrations of 23 5 mm and 4 5 mm respectively for start up initially the ph of both reactors was controlled at 9 by adding 4 m naoh with an automatic titrator since a previous study showed ph 9 was optimal for vfa production from was at mesophilic condition8 the ph was increased later to inhibit methane production and gas recirculation was also applied to increase the gas liquid mass transfer of syngas synthetic syngas was initially made by co 40 n2 40 co2 20 and later n2 was replaced by h2 the detailed operational conditions of the two reactors are shown in table 1 the two reactors were operated at ph 9 9 5 and 10 from day 0 40 phase i 41 133 phase ii and 134 164 phase iii respectively in addition gas recirculation was applied to both reactors c and s from day 103 to make them comparable the gases in the headspaces of both reactors were recirculated the gas compositions in the gasbags and the concentrations of vfa in the effluents were measured periodically 2 3 co conversion pathways co can be biologically converted to acetate directly or indirectly by h2 as the intermediate jing et al 2017 batch experiments were conducted to determine the co conversion pathways in reactor s in each operational phase 10 ml sludge collected from reactor s during each steady state was used as inoculum for the tests in 118 ml bottles the inocula for the batch experiments had the same characteristics as the effluents obtained in each operational phase as shown in table 1 ba medium was then added to adjust the liquid volume to 60 ml angelidaki and sanders 2004 the ph of the liquid was adjusted to the corresponding ph of reactor s in each phase the headspaces of the bottles were purged with the mixture of co and n2 with the ratios 40 60 the bottles were then sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum crimps the bottles were incubated in a 37 c shaker with 400 rpm to overcome the gas liquid mass transfer limitation all the tests were performed in triplicates the concentrations of co and h2 in the headspaces and the concentrations of vfa in the liquid were measured periodically 2 4 effects of the acetate concentration on the conversion of co and h2 acetate was the dominant product and therefore batch experiments were conducted to reveal its effects on the conversion of co and h2 based on the results from continuous experiments the conditions in phase iii for reactor s was beneficial for both syngas and was fermentation and therefore the sludge from reactor s at the end of phase iii was collected the sludge was centrifuged and the supernatant was discharged to remove the residual acetate in the sludge the precipitate was then resuspended by adding ba medium to the same volume before centrifugation 10 ml sludge was then used as inoculum in the 118 ml bottles and ba medium was added to adjust the liquid volume to 60 ml different amounts of sodium acetate were added to obtain the different final acetate concentrations 0 50 mm 100 mm 150 mm 200 mm and 300 mm the effects of the acetate concentration on the conversion of co and h2 were tested separately and the specific activities for co and h2 at different acetate concentrations were calculated based on their depletion rates in the batch experiments the detailed procedures for the experiments were similar as described in part 2 3 all the experiments were conducted in triplicates 2 5 microbial community compositions as revealed by high throughput sequencing hts of 16 s rrna genes two samples as biological replicates were obtained from each reactor in each phase 9c1 9c2 9 5c1 9 5c2 10c1 and 10c2 were obtained from reactor c on days 35 40 99 133 160 164 respectively the numbers 9 9 5 and 10 represented the ph in the reactors since the performances of reactor c with and without gas recirculation in phase ii were similar the samples were only taken on days 129 and 133 9sc1 9sc2 9 5sc1 9 5sc2 9 5sch1 9 5sch2 9 5schr1 9 5schr2 10schr1 10schr2 were obtained from reactor s on days 35 40 66 71 98 102 129 133 160 164 respectively the subscripts c ch chr for the name of the above samples mean co co and h2 and co and h2 with gas recirculation respectively the information of the samples can be also found in table 1 one sample from was was also collected for microbial analysis detailed information about the dna extraction pcr and bioinformatics analysis is shown in supporting information all the sequences were uploaded to ncbi with accession number sub3105883 2 6 qpcr analysis the total bacteria methanogens methanobacteriales mbt methanomicrobiales mmb methanosarcina msc and methanosaeta mst and acetogens were quantified by qpcr and detailed information is described in supporting information 2 7 analytical methods tss vss and cod were measured according to standard methods apha 1995 the gas composition was analyzed by a gas chromatography equipped with a tcd detector for co and ch4 the carrier gas was he and the temperatures of the injector detector and oven were 120 c 110 c and 120 c respectively for h2 the carrier gas was changed to n2 while the other conditions were the same the concentrations of acetate propionate iso butyrate butyrate isovalerate and valerate were determined by hplc and they were separated with a 7 8 300 aminex hpx 87 h column bio rad at 55 c with a refractive index detector at 50 c the mobile phase was 5 mm h2so4 at a flow rate of 0 4 ml min the concentration of total carbohydrate was measured by phenol sulfuric method and the concentration of total protein was determined by lowry folin method wan et al 2016 the ph values were measured by ph meter fe20 mettler toledom switzerland the analysis of variance anova was used to test the significance of results and p 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 performances of the reactors the simultaneous anaerobic fermentation of was and syngas into vfa was tested in continuous mesophilic anaerobic reactors both reactors were operated in batch modes to accumulate the anaerobic microorganisms before continuous experiments and they had similar vfa production profiles during the batch experiments fig s1 the time courses of the collected gas and produced vfa for both reactors in the continuous experiments are shown in fig 1 and the performances in steady states of each operational period are also summarized in table 1 in phase i the ph of the fermentation was controlled at 9 0 and syngas was composed by co 40 n2 40 co2 20 acetate was the main product and higher concentration of acetate was observed in reactor s 35 9 mm in reactor s vs 20 5 mm in reactor c p 0 0009 0 05 which was mainly due to the conversion of co into acetate as shown in table 1 67 3 of the injected co was consumed it should be noted that ch4 was also detected in the collected gas and the produced ch4 in reactor s 60 9 ml d was significantly higher than that in reactor c 10 5 ml d p 0 00006 0 05 a previous study showed that mesophilic anaerobic fermentation of was at ph 9 resulted in very low methane yield 0 009 gcodch4 gvss zhang et al 2009 however the methane yield was calculated to be 0 051 gcodch4 gvss in the present study in reactor c which was around 5 times higher than the previous study it should be noted that the previous study was conducted in batch experiment and the value 0 009 gcodch4 gvss was obtained after 5 days fermentation while the present study was conducted in continuous experiments for 40 days in phase i which might lead to the enrichment of methanogens after long term cultivation considering the low growth rate of methanogens luo et al 2011 siegrist et al 2002 table 1 also showed that 62 5 of the consumed co was converted to methane while only 32 of the consumed co was converted to acetate therefore it was necessary to inhibit methanogens to improve the conversion efficiency of co to acetate in phase ii the fermentation ph was increased to 9 5 in order to test the possible inhibition on methanogenesis the methane production in reactor c 2 5 ml d was significantly lower compared to that 10 5 ml d in phase i p 0 005 0 05 from day 41 to day 71 syngas was still composed by co 40 n2 40 co2 20 and it was obvious the produced methane 8 2 ml d was also much lower than that 60 9 ml d in phase i p 0 00004 0 05 the above results indicated that the increase of fermentation ph could reduce the conversion of co to ch4 however much higher ch4 production 53 1 ml d in reactor s was observed when the syngas was changed to co 40 h2 40 co2 20 since day 72 p 0 00009 0 05 which showed that h2 was easier to be converted to methane compared to co at ph 9 5 in this case around 34 6 of the consumed co and h2 was converted to methane the reason could be that hydrogenotrophic methanoegens were not so sensitive to the changes of environmental conditions compared to acetoclastic methanogens demirel and scherer 2008 and hydrogenotrophic methanogens might be enriched at ph 9 5 when h2 was injected to the reactor in addition it has been shown that co was mainly converted to acetate instead of h2 under mesophilic condition sipma et al 2003 therefore methane production from co was very low at ph 9 5 the above explanations were also proved and discussed later in the context from day 103 gas recirculation was applied since less than 70 of both co and h2 were consumed in the experiments which was due to the gas liquid mass transfer limitation the performances of reactor c during days 41 102 and days 103 133 were similar which meant gas recirculation did not affect the anaerobic fermentation of was however more co and h2 90 in reactor s were converted after gas recirculation indicating gas recirculation was effective to increase the conversion efficiency of syngas p 0 0006 0 05 for co p 0 00006 0 05 for h2 at the same time more ch4 75 6 ml d was produced p 0 006 0 05 in phase iii ph was further increased to 10 the methane production in both reactors were extremely low and most of the consumed co and h2 were converted to acetate 88 8 indicating ph 10 was effective to inhibit methanogens it should be noted that there were no significant differences in the concentrations of vss p 0 34 0 05 soluble carbohydrates p 0 49 0 05 and soluble proteins p 0 57 0 05 for both reactors c and s in phase iii which indicated that the addition of co and h2 might not affect the original anaerobic fermentation of was both co and h2 were mainly converted to acetate since the concentrations of other vfa except acetate in reactor s were similar to reactor c the above results clearly demonstrated that it was feasible for simultaneous anaerobic fermentation of syngas and was to acetate at ph 10 and mesophilic condition it should also be noted that the vfa production were not increased in reactor c when the ph was increased from 9 to 9 5 and 10 although the methane production was inhibited it might indicate that the increase of ph from 9 to 9 5 and 10 had slight negative effects on vfa production nevertheless similar acetate production from was p 0 29 0 05 for acetate were still obtained at ph 9 9 5 and 10 in reactor c 3 2 co conversion pathways batch experiments were conducted to determine the co conversion pathways in reactor s in different operational periods and the results are shown in fig s2 in phase i acetate was the final product however h2 was also detected as an intermediate it was reported co was directly converted to acetate at mesophilic condition navarro et al 2014 sipma et al 2003 however it seems that both acetogenic and hydrogenogenic co oxidizing pathways were active at ph 9 in our study equations 1 and 2 which was also supported by the thermodynamic analysis as seen in fig s2 a the maximum accumulated h2 during the batch experiments was corresponded to the conversion of around 25 of co it should be noted that the actual value of produced h2 from co might be higher than the above value since h2 might be produced and consumed simultaneously however in both phases ii and iii h2 was not detected as an intermediate indicating hydrogenogenic co oxidizing pathway might be inhibited in this case the methane production in reactor s day 41 71 was much lower than that in phase i therefore the lower methane production could be attributed to both higher ph and the possible inhibition of hydrogenogenic co oxidizing pathway the increased ch4 production was observed after h2 was injected at ph 9 5 from day 72 to day 102 and the presence of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis at ph 9 and 9 5 were also confirmed by microbial community analysis as discussed later therefore the inhibition of hydrogenogenic co oxidizing pathway might be the main reason for lower methane production from co at ph 9 5 day 41 to day 71 compared with ph 9 since there might be no h2 available for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis from day 41 to day 71 further experiments also showed the inhibition of hydrogenogenic co oxidizing pathway at ph 9 5 with the addition of chloroform to inhibit the activities of homoacetogens during the batch experiments liu et al 2016 fig s3 the above results showed that ph affected the co conversion pathways and ph 9 5 and 10 were beneficial for the acetate production from solely co by anaerobic fermentation compared with ph 9 further study could also be conducted to test whether the increase of ph to higher than 10 can facilitate acetate production since the existing hydroxide ions might neutralize more produced protons 1 4co 2h2o ch3coo h 2co2 g o 44 kj mol co 2 co h2o h2 co2 g o 20 kj mol co 3 3 sensitivity to acetate as shown in table 1 the maximum concentration of acetate was around 135 mm in phase iii and generally the high concentrations of products could be inhibitory for the fermentation process agler et al 2012 joblin and naylor 1993 therefore the activity tests for co and h2 were conducted under different acetate concentrations 0 300 mm using the sludge obtained from reactor s in phase iii as shown in fig 2 the maximum specific activities for the consumption of co and h2 were obtained when no acetate was present slight decreases of specific activities for the consumption of co and h2 were observed when the initial acetate concentration was increased from 0 mm to 150 mm and later sharp decreases of specific activities for the consumption of co and h2 were observed with the increase of initial acetate concentration from 200 mm to 300 mm the above results showed that acetate had negative effects on the conversion of co and h2 and therefore the removal of acetate from the liquid was necessary to achieve high co and h2 conversion rates the conversion rates of co and h2 in phase iii in the reactor s were also calculated and they were 5 71 mm gvss d for co and 5 86 mm gvss d for h2 since the acetate concentration in phase iii was 135 mm the specific activities for the consumption of co and h2 should be higher than that at acetate concentration 150 mm 16 7 mm gvss d for co and 24 3 mm gvss d for h2 as shown in fig 2 the much lower values in the continuous reactors might be related with the gas liquid mass transfer since in the batch experiment intensive mixing was applied and therefore the limitation of the gas liquid mass transfer could be ignored it also indicated that reactor s still had high potential to efficiently convert syngas moreover co2 might also affect the acetate production from co since it was a final product as seen in equation 1 which deserves further investigation 3 4 microbial community compositions as revealed by hts of 16 s rrna genes in total 17 samples were collected from the reactors and also the raw was during the whole operational periods rectanglar cladogram based on bray curtis similarity matrices was used to reveal the differences of the microbial community compositions among the samples fig 3 which took into account the abundance of sequences in each otu luo et al 2013 the replicate samples obtained from the reactors were generally clustered together indicating the stable microbial community compositions during the steady states of the reactors in each phase in addition the samples obtained at the same ph from both reactors c and s were clustered together while was was separated from all the other samples similar results were also obtained as seen in fig s4 based on otu analysis with both bray curtis and hellinger similarity matrix in addition pca based on otu analysis at 0 03 distance also showed similar results fig s5 the above results clearly showed that ph seems to be the most important factor determining the dynamics of the microbial community compositions for reactors c and s during the whole operational periods the increase of ph resulted in the increase of the relative abundances of firmicutes e g 35 37 at ph 9 46 63 at ph 9 5 and 65 86 at ph 10 fig s6 which also showed that ph played important role in shaping microbial community compositions a previous study also showed fermentation at ph 9 and 10 resulted in obvious differences in the microbial community compositions during the anaerobic fermentation of the mixture of primary sludge and was maspolim et al 2015 it was possible that the microbial community compositions at different ph might already contained the bacteria that could convert co and h2 e g it was found h2 could be converted to acetate during the fermentation of was at ph 10 and mesophilic condition in our previous study wan et al 2016 therefore the addition of syngas might not change the microbial community compositions significantly as compared to ph methanogens belong to the phylum euryarchaeota karakashev et al 2005 and the dynamics of this phylum determined the efficiencies of acetate production by the anaerobic fermentation of syngas higher relative abundances 2 96 and 3 07 of euryarchaeota in 9sc1 and 9sc2 were observed compared with 9c1 and 9c2 1 13 and 1 51 which was consistent with the higher methane production in reactor s than reactor c in phase i as shown in fig s7 almost all methanogens belonged to the hydrogenotrophic order methanobacteriales for all the samples previous studies also showed there were species e g methanobacterium alcaliphilum methanobacterium subterraneurn belonging to methanobacteriales that can grow at alkaline conditions kotelnikova et al 1998 worakit et al 1986 the above results indicated the methane produced in the current study was via hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis it was also consistent with fig s2 that h2 was an intermediate during co conversion in phase i the increase of ph to 9 5 from day 41 to day 71 resulted in decreased relative abundances 0 45 and 0 42 of euryarchaeota and decreased methane production in reactor s which might be mainly due to the changes of metabolic pathway of co from both hydrogenogenic and acetogenic co oxidizing pathways to only acetogenic co oxidizing pathway as previously mentioned and therefore there was no h2 for methane production when co n2 co2 was changed to co h2 co2 from day 72 obvious increase of the relative abundances 2 96 and 3 07 of euryarchaeota and higher methane production was observed indicating hydrogenotrophic methanogens could be enriched even at ph 9 5 further increase of ph to 10 in phase iii resulted in the lowest relative abundances of euryarchaeota suggesting ph 10 could inhibit the growth of hydrogenotrophic methanogens and therefore co and h2 can be efficiently converted to acetate the present study showed that ph 10 was optimal for efficient acetate production from syngas and was therefore the microbial community compositions in both reactors c and s were compared to reveal the effects of syngas on the microbial community compositions in the anaerobic fermentation of was the higher relative abundances of firmicutes in reactor s around 85 was observed compared with reactor c around 65 fig s6 indicating the addition of syngas resulted in the enrichment of firmicutes in fact previous studies also showed that homoacetogens and acetogenic co oxidizing bacteria belonged to this phylum drake et al 2006 treu et al 2016 the results of genus level classification are shown in fig 4 the genus natronincola and desulfitispora were obviously enriched in reactor s with relative abundances higher than 15 while they were all below 0 5 in reactor c the genus natronincola contains alkaliphilic acetogens that could convert h2 co2 to acetate zhilina et al 1998 and therefore its enrichment was related with the conversion of h2 the genus desulfitispora could ferment carbohydrates under alkaliphilic condition sorokin and muyzer 2010 but it has not been reported for the ability to produce acetate from either h2 or co table s1 lists the known mesophilic co converting microorganisms to date most of the known mesophilic co converting microorganisms are neutrophilic except alkalibaculum bacchi which can grow in the range of 6 5 10 5 allen et al 2010 however they were not found or enriched in reactor s indicating there might be other unknown bacteria playing important roles for co conversion as shown in fig 4 it can be seen more than 40 sequences could not be classified which might be related with the unknown bacteria for co conversion venn diagram based on otu at 0 03 distance showed that 361 otus were shared by the samples obtained from reactors c and s accounting for 16 of the total otus fig s8 the shared otus which were enriched in reactor s and the unique otus in reactor s were analyzed as shown in table 2 and table s2 only otu1 unique had high similarity 97 to the known acetogen clostridium formicaceticum drake et al 2008 most of the other otus listed in table 2 had high similarity with known alkaliphilic bacteria alkaliphilus transvaalensis desulfitispora alkaliphila anaerobranca californiensis anaerobranca gottschalkii which grow heterotrophically gorlenko et al 2004 prowe and antranikian 2001 sorokin and muyzer 2010 takai et al 2001 the above bacteria might be responsible for the was acidification and their enrichment in reactor s might be due to the selection by syngas the above results clearly showed that the addition of syngas not only resulted in the enrichment of certain bacteria for syngas conversion but also induced the changes of microbial community compositions degrading was by comparison to that in reactor c 3 5 dynamics of key microbial populations as revealed by qpcr analysis fig 5 shows the concentrations of total bacteria methanogens and acetogens in all the samples at all operational periods the concentrations of total bacteria were higher in reactor s than that in reactor c which was due to the addition of syngas it is worth mentioning that the increased concentration of bacteria in reactor s did not result in the obvious increase of vss concentrations compared with reactor c table 1 which could be due to that vss in the present study mainly represent the organic contents in was and the concentrations of bacteria might only contribute to very small amount of vss for methanogens the concentrations of mbt were obviously much higher than mmb msc and mst when there was obvious methane production in the reactors e g samples 9c 9sc 9 5sch and 9 5schr the result was consistent with that from hts of 16 s rrna genes and indicated hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis played an important role for methane production during alkaline fermentation and ph at 10 could inhibit the growth of methanogens it was known acetogens mediated the acetate production from h2 co2 and it was also reported most acetogens could also utilize co drake et al 2006 luo et al 2011 therefore the concentrations of acetogens were also determined increased concentrations of acetogens were observed in 9sc compared with 9c since only co n2 co2 was injected in phase i the enrichment of acetogens might be related with the conversion of co in phase ii and iii the injected gas was changed to co h2 co2 further increase of acetogens were observed which indicated acetogens were responsible for the acetate production from both co and h2 the enrichment of acetogens in reactor s was also demonstrated by hts of 16 s rrna genes as previously mentioned 3 6 prospects a proof of concept for simultaneous conversion of was and syngas to vfa mainly acetate by mesophilic alkaline fermentation at ph 10 was demonstrated in the present study the integration of was and syngas for vfa production is a new concept which could achieve full conversion of organics in was into vfa by integrating biological and thermochemical technologies in addition it was demonstrated that co can be bio converted to acetate under ph 10 by anaerobic mixed culture for the first time which provides new knowledge for co fermentation the present study was conducted in lab scale reactors which was mainly used to demonstrate the feasibility of the new concept and therefore more efforts should be made to accelerate its industrial application first both co and h2 have low solubility and therefore gas liquid mass transfer is the limiting step for their efficient conversion luo et al 2013 gas recirculation was adopted in the present study and other methods hollow fiber membrane high pressure fermentation are deserved to be tested in the future to explore the most efficient method in real application munasinghe and khanal 2012 second the efficient conversion of both co and h2 can result in the high concentration of acetate in the fermentation broth which will have inhibition on their conversion therefore in situ extraction of acetate is necessary and the combination of anaerobic fermentation with in situ electrodialysis for acetate recovery might be a promising technology wang et al 2012 deserving further study in addition syngas not only contains co h2 co2 but also contains tar which is a complex mixture including benzene toluene xylene and so on phuphuakrat et al 2010 the effects of tar on the mesophilic alkaline fermentation remain to be elucidated the control of ph at 10 during the mesophilic alkaline fermentation process requires the addition of alkali although the present study used naoh for ph adjustment ca oh 2 should be used in practice considering its low cost 75 us ton ca oh 2 vs 284 us ton naoh wan et al 2016 a previous study made a rough estimation on the mesophilic alkaline fermentation for vfa production from was and it showed that the cost of consumed ca oh 2 and the value of produced vfa were 11 2 us ton was and 40 us ton was respectively li et al 2014 therefore the total cost saving was around 28 8 us ton was in the present study more vfa was produced considering the conversion of syngas and therefore more alkali would be required to neutralize the additional vfa mainly acetate production from syngas based on equation 3 it can be calculated that 1 ton additional acetate production would require 0 62 ton additional ca oh 2 addition the total cost saving should be 454 us ton acetate based on the prices of acetate 500 us ton for acetate to be used as the internal carbon sources for denitrification and ca oh 2 75 us ton from a previous literature li et al 2014 the above results showed the novel process for vfa production from syngas by integrating with mesophilic alkaline fermentation of was would be both technically and economically feasible it should be noted that previous studies also showed that it was possible to produce alcohols valuable biofuels by the reduction of acetate with h2 under high pressures 1 5 bar steinbusch et al 2008 2009 however alcohols were not detected in the present study and it might be due to the unfavorable conditions e g low hydrogen pressure and the presence of co which deserves further study to directly produce alcohols from was and syngas 3 2ch3cooh ca oh 2 ch3coo 2ca 2h2o 4 conclusions a new concept for the vfa production from syngas by integrating with mesophilic alkaline fermentation of was was demonstrated in the present study methane production from co was observed at ph 9 due to the presence of hydrogenogenic pathway for co conversion while it was inhibited when ph was increased from 9 to 9 5 due to the possible presence of only acetogenic pathway for co conversion however h2 contained in syngas was still converted to methane even at ph 9 5 by hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanobacteriales the control of ph at 10 was necessary to inhibit methane production from syngas to efficiently produce vfa mainly acetate it was also found that high acetate concentration 150 mm had negative effects on the conversion of syngas microbial community analysis further showed that the addition of syngas induced the changes of microbial community for the fermentation of was at ph 10 and some known bacteria relating with syngas conversion were also identified acknowledgement we acknowledge the

19582,the present study proposed and demonstrated a novel process for the bioconversion of syngas mainly co and h2 to valuable volatile fatty acids vfa by integrating with mesophilic alkaline fermentation of waste activated sludge was the results showed that although ph 9 was suitable for vfa production from was 62 5 of the consumed co was converted to methane due to the presence of hydrogenogenic pathway for co conversion the increase of ph from 9 to 9 5 inhibited the methane production from co because of the possible presence of only acetogenic pathway for co conversion however methane was still produced from h2 contained in syngas through hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and around 32 34 of the consumed syngas was converted to methane at both ph 9 and 9 5 methane was produced by hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanobacteriales further increase of ph to 10 effectively inhibited methane production from syngas and efficient vfa mainly acetate with the concentration of around 135 mm production by simultaneous conversion of syngas and was was achieved high acetate concentrations 150 mm were shown to have serious negative effects on the conversion of syngas the addition of syngas to the mesophilic alkaline fermentation of was at ph 10 not only resulted in the enrichment of some known bacteria related with syngas conversion but also changed the microbial community compositions for the fermentation of was graphical abstract image 1 keywords volatile fatty acids production waste activated sludge syngas mesophilic alkaline fermentation microbial community analysis 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is produced in huge quantities from municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps and anaerobic digestion has been widely used in wwtps as an effective sludge treatment and disposal technology to produce biogas li et al 2014 luo et al 2016 although biogas can be upgraded to natural gas the price of natural gas has dropped in recent years due to exploration of novel shale gas reservoirs kleerebezem et al 2015 alternative processes have been suggested to convert was into new resources e g volatile fatty acids vfa hydrogen bio oil and et al tyagi and lo 2013 the production of vfa via anaerobic fermentation of was has attracted much attention which can be used as commodity chemicals precursors for higher value compounds including alcohols long chain fatty acids and polyhydroxyalkanoates pha and readily biodegradable carbon sources for biological nutrients removal agler et al 2011 cagnetta et al 2016 li et al 2014 wu et al 2016 it was estimated that the revenue of pha production was more than 5 times higher than biogas production kleerebezem et al 2015 therefore vfa has higher value compared to biogas which will increase the overall economy to was bioconversion process there are some challenges regarding was bioconversion was is difficult to be biodegraded and therefore its hydrolysis has been recognized as the rate limiting step for anaerobic conversion neumann et al 2016 moreover when other products than biogas are in target from was such as vfa measures for inhibiting methanogens are required zhang et al 2009 previous studies showed that alkaline fermentation ph 8 10 of was for vfa production was promising since it could enhance the hydrolysis of was and at the same time inhibit methanogenesis to efficiently produce vfa li et al 2014 yuan et al 2006 zhang et al 2009 it should be noted that a significant amount around 60 of organics in was still could not be solubilized and biodegraded li et al 2014 yuan et al 2006 zhang et al 2009 and therefore remains in the effluents after anaerobic fermentation for vfa production the low degradation efficiency of was was also observed for biogas production feng et al 2014 luo et al 2013 via anaerobic digestion in fact there are many organic wastes e g lignocellulosic wastes and municipal solid wastes which are difficult to be biodegraded guiot et al 2011 zheng et al 2014 thermal gasification is an effective method for the conversion of non readily biodegradable organic wastes latif et al 2014 it involves high temperatures usually 600 900 c in the presence of oxidizing agents e g oxygen or steam resulting in the partial oxidation of the organic matter gasifying it to syngas with significant amounts of co h2 and co2 richardson et al 2012 syngas can be used as fuel in gas motors however the volumetric energy density of syngas is low which is only about 50 of natural gas guiot et al 2011 alternatively syngas can be metabolized by certain microorganisms and converted to valuable chemicals including acetate ethanol butyrate and et al latif et al 2014 clostridium ljungdahlii was found to be able to utilize co and h2 for acetate and ethanol production as early as in 1987 chen and henson 2016 and then more pure cultures within the genus clostridium were isolated for syngas fermentation köpke et al 2011 both clostridium ljungdahlii and clostridium ragsdalei have been well studied for their ability to produce vfa and ethanol from syngas el gammal et al 2017 mohammadi et al 2016 however most previous studies focused on syngas fermentation by pure cultures which require sterilized conditions syngas fermentation by mixed culture might be more promising considering the potential advantages including non sterilized conditions and utilization of wastewater as nutrients homoacetogenesis is a well known process for acetate production from h2 and co2 and has been shown in anaerobic fermentation process for organic wastes treatment luo et al 2011 saady 2013 a previous study also showed that other fatty acids e g butyrate caproate can be produced from h2 and co2 by anaerobic mixed culture in a hollow fiber membrane biofilm reactor zhang et al 2013 furthermore previous studies showed that anaerobic mixed sludge from biogas reactors can be used for co conversion and acetate was the main product guiot et al 2011 jing et al 2017 sipma et al 2003 as previously mentioned alkaline fermentation has been developed for vfa production from was and it also involves various microorganisms wan et al 2016 therefore a novel process for vfa production from syngas by integrating with mesophilic alkaline fermentation of was was proposed in the present study in our previous study we found that homoacetogenesis was occurring during mesophilic alkaline fermentation of was wan et al 2016 and therefore the present study mainly focused on the mesophilic alkaline fermentation for simultaneously vfa production from was and syngas there are several challenges in the new process remaining to be elucidated first although it was proved homoacetogenesis occurred under mesophilic alkaline condition wan et al 2016 it was still unknown whether co can be metabolized under such condition second h2 was known to affect the degradation of fatty acids e g propionate and butyrate and co was reported to be toxic for many microorganisms due to its high affinity to metal containing enzymes luo et al 2012 2013 and therefore it was crucial to reveal the effects of syngas addition on the degradation of was and the changes of microbial community compositions finally the addition of syngas to the anaerobic fermentation of was would increase the vfa concentration which might affect the conversion efficiency of syngas due to the inhibition from the products based on the above considerations the present study aimed to investigate the feasibility of vfa production by integrating mesophilic alkaline fermentation of was with syngas conversion moreover the effects of syngas addition on the reactor performances and microbial community compositions of mesophilic alkaline fermentation of was were elucidated 2 material and methods 2 1 was was was collected from a secondary sedimentation tank in quyang municipal wastewater treatment plant which is located in shanghai china the main characteristics of was were as follows total suspended solids tss 10 1 0 7 g l volatile suspended solids vss 7 8 0 6 g l ph 6 9 0 1 chemical oxygen demand cod 12 3 0 5 g l vfa 0 2 0 01 mm mainly acetate total proteins 6 8 0 3 g l and total carbohydrates 0 6 0 02 g l 2 2 set up of the reactors two 1 l continuously stirred tank reactors with working volume 0 6 l were used one reactor c was fed with only was without syngas as control and the other one s was fed with both was and syngas both reactors were continuously stirred by magnetic stirrers at a stirring speed of 200 rpm and the temperature was controlled at 37 c by thermal water jackets syngas was injected into reactor s through a gas diffuser by a peristaltic pump the gas leaving the reactors was collected in gasbags both reactors were operated at hrt of 8 days based on previous studies 2 8 by removing and feeding 75 ml was every day no inoculum was used for starting up the reactors alternatively both reactors were filled with raw was and were operated in batch mode under anaerobic conditions until the concentrations of vfa achieved maximum values mainly acetate and propionate with the approximately maximum concentrations of 23 5 mm and 4 5 mm respectively for start up initially the ph of both reactors was controlled at 9 by adding 4 m naoh with an automatic titrator since a previous study showed ph 9 was optimal for vfa production from was at mesophilic condition8 the ph was increased later to inhibit methane production and gas recirculation was also applied to increase the gas liquid mass transfer of syngas synthetic syngas was initially made by co 40 n2 40 co2 20 and later n2 was replaced by h2 the detailed operational conditions of the two reactors are shown in table 1 the two reactors were operated at ph 9 9 5 and 10 from day 0 40 phase i 41 133 phase ii and 134 164 phase iii respectively in addition gas recirculation was applied to both reactors c and s from day 103 to make them comparable the gases in the headspaces of both reactors were recirculated the gas compositions in the gasbags and the concentrations of vfa in the effluents were measured periodically 2 3 co conversion pathways co can be biologically converted to acetate directly or indirectly by h2 as the intermediate jing et al 2017 batch experiments were conducted to determine the co conversion pathways in reactor s in each operational phase 10 ml sludge collected from reactor s during each steady state was used as inoculum for the tests in 118 ml bottles the inocula for the batch experiments had the same characteristics as the effluents obtained in each operational phase as shown in table 1 ba medium was then added to adjust the liquid volume to 60 ml angelidaki and sanders 2004 the ph of the liquid was adjusted to the corresponding ph of reactor s in each phase the headspaces of the bottles were purged with the mixture of co and n2 with the ratios 40 60 the bottles were then sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum crimps the bottles were incubated in a 37 c shaker with 400 rpm to overcome the gas liquid mass transfer limitation all the tests were performed in triplicates the concentrations of co and h2 in the headspaces and the concentrations of vfa in the liquid were measured periodically 2 4 effects of the acetate concentration on the conversion of co and h2 acetate was the dominant product and therefore batch experiments were conducted to reveal its effects on the conversion of co and h2 based on the results from continuous experiments the conditions in phase iii for reactor s was beneficial for both syngas and was fermentation and therefore the sludge from reactor s at the end of phase iii was collected the sludge was centrifuged and the supernatant was discharged to remove the residual acetate in the sludge the precipitate was then resuspended by adding ba medium to the same volume before centrifugation 10 ml sludge was then used as inoculum in the 118 ml bottles and ba medium was added to adjust the liquid volume to 60 ml different amounts of sodium acetate were added to obtain the different final acetate concentrations 0 50 mm 100 mm 150 mm 200 mm and 300 mm the effects of the acetate concentration on the conversion of co and h2 were tested separately and the specific activities for co and h2 at different acetate concentrations were calculated based on their depletion rates in the batch experiments the detailed procedures for the experiments were similar as described in part 2 3 all the experiments were conducted in triplicates 2 5 microbial community compositions as revealed by high throughput sequencing hts of 16 s rrna genes two samples as biological replicates were obtained from each reactor in each phase 9c1 9c2 9 5c1 9 5c2 10c1 and 10c2 were obtained from reactor c on days 35 40 99 133 160 164 respectively the numbers 9 9 5 and 10 represented the ph in the reactors since the performances of reactor c with and without gas recirculation in phase ii were similar the samples were only taken on days 129 and 133 9sc1 9sc2 9 5sc1 9 5sc2 9 5sch1 9 5sch2 9 5schr1 9 5schr2 10schr1 10schr2 were obtained from reactor s on days 35 40 66 71 98 102 129 133 160 164 respectively the subscripts c ch chr for the name of the above samples mean co co and h2 and co and h2 with gas recirculation respectively the information of the samples can be also found in table 1 one sample from was was also collected for microbial analysis detailed information about the dna extraction pcr and bioinformatics analysis is shown in supporting information all the sequences were uploaded to ncbi with accession number sub3105883 2 6 qpcr analysis the total bacteria methanogens methanobacteriales mbt methanomicrobiales mmb methanosarcina msc and methanosaeta mst and acetogens were quantified by qpcr and detailed information is described in supporting information 2 7 analytical methods tss vss and cod were measured according to standard methods apha 1995 the gas composition was analyzed by a gas chromatography equipped with a tcd detector for co and ch4 the carrier gas was he and the temperatures of the injector detector and oven were 120 c 110 c and 120 c respectively for h2 the carrier gas was changed to n2 while the other conditions were the same the concentrations of acetate propionate iso butyrate butyrate isovalerate and valerate were determined by hplc and they were separated with a 7 8 300 aminex hpx 87 h column bio rad at 55 c with a refractive index detector at 50 c the mobile phase was 5 mm h2so4 at a flow rate of 0 4 ml min the concentration of total carbohydrate was measured by phenol sulfuric method and the concentration of total protein was determined by lowry folin method wan et al 2016 the ph values were measured by ph meter fe20 mettler toledom switzerland the analysis of variance anova was used to test the significance of results and p 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 performances of the reactors the simultaneous anaerobic fermentation of was and syngas into vfa was tested in continuous mesophilic anaerobic reactors both reactors were operated in batch modes to accumulate the anaerobic microorganisms before continuous experiments and they had similar vfa production profiles during the batch experiments fig s1 the time courses of the collected gas and produced vfa for both reactors in the continuous experiments are shown in fig 1 and the performances in steady states of each operational period are also summarized in table 1 in phase i the ph of the fermentation was controlled at 9 0 and syngas was composed by co 40 n2 40 co2 20 acetate was the main product and higher concentration of acetate was observed in reactor s 35 9 mm in reactor s vs 20 5 mm in reactor c p 0 0009 0 05 which was mainly due to the conversion of co into acetate as shown in table 1 67 3 of the injected co was consumed it should be noted that ch4 was also detected in the collected gas and the produced ch4 in reactor s 60 9 ml d was significantly higher than that in reactor c 10 5 ml d p 0 00006 0 05 a previous study showed that mesophilic anaerobic fermentation of was at ph 9 resulted in very low methane yield 0 009 gcodch4 gvss zhang et al 2009 however the methane yield was calculated to be 0 051 gcodch4 gvss in the present study in reactor c which was around 5 times higher than the previous study it should be noted that the previous study was conducted in batch experiment and the value 0 009 gcodch4 gvss was obtained after 5 days fermentation while the present study was conducted in continuous experiments for 40 days in phase i which might lead to the enrichment of methanogens after long term cultivation considering the low growth rate of methanogens luo et al 2011 siegrist et al 2002 table 1 also showed that 62 5 of the consumed co was converted to methane while only 32 of the consumed co was converted to acetate therefore it was necessary to inhibit methanogens to improve the conversion efficiency of co to acetate in phase ii the fermentation ph was increased to 9 5 in order to test the possible inhibition on methanogenesis the methane production in reactor c 2 5 ml d was significantly lower compared to that 10 5 ml d in phase i p 0 005 0 05 from day 41 to day 71 syngas was still composed by co 40 n2 40 co2 20 and it was obvious the produced methane 8 2 ml d was also much lower than that 60 9 ml d in phase i p 0 00004 0 05 the above results indicated that the increase of fermentation ph could reduce the conversion of co to ch4 however much higher ch4 production 53 1 ml d in reactor s was observed when the syngas was changed to co 40 h2 40 co2 20 since day 72 p 0 00009 0 05 which showed that h2 was easier to be converted to methane compared to co at ph 9 5 in this case around 34 6 of the consumed co and h2 was converted to methane the reason could be that hydrogenotrophic methanoegens were not so sensitive to the changes of environmental conditions compared to acetoclastic methanogens demirel and scherer 2008 and hydrogenotrophic methanogens might be enriched at ph 9 5 when h2 was injected to the reactor in addition it has been shown that co was mainly converted to acetate instead of h2 under mesophilic condition sipma et al 2003 therefore methane production from co was very low at ph 9 5 the above explanations were also proved and discussed later in the context from day 103 gas recirculation was applied since less than 70 of both co and h2 were consumed in the experiments which was due to the gas liquid mass transfer limitation the performances of reactor c during days 41 102 and days 103 133 were similar which meant gas recirculation did not affect the anaerobic fermentation of was however more co and h2 90 in reactor s were converted after gas recirculation indicating gas recirculation was effective to increase the conversion efficiency of syngas p 0 0006 0 05 for co p 0 00006 0 05 for h2 at the same time more ch4 75 6 ml d was produced p 0 006 0 05 in phase iii ph was further increased to 10 the methane production in both reactors were extremely low and most of the consumed co and h2 were converted to acetate 88 8 indicating ph 10 was effective to inhibit methanogens it should be noted that there were no significant differences in the concentrations of vss p 0 34 0 05 soluble carbohydrates p 0 49 0 05 and soluble proteins p 0 57 0 05 for both reactors c and s in phase iii which indicated that the addition of co and h2 might not affect the original anaerobic fermentation of was both co and h2 were mainly converted to acetate since the concentrations of other vfa except acetate in reactor s were similar to reactor c the above results clearly demonstrated that it was feasible for simultaneous anaerobic fermentation of syngas and was to acetate at ph 10 and mesophilic condition it should also be noted that the vfa production were not increased in reactor c when the ph was increased from 9 to 9 5 and 10 although the methane production was inhibited it might indicate that the increase of ph from 9 to 9 5 and 10 had slight negative effects on vfa production nevertheless similar acetate production from was p 0 29 0 05 for acetate were still obtained at ph 9 9 5 and 10 in reactor c 3 2 co conversion pathways batch experiments were conducted to determine the co conversion pathways in reactor s in different operational periods and the results are shown in fig s2 in phase i acetate was the final product however h2 was also detected as an intermediate it was reported co was directly converted to acetate at mesophilic condition navarro et al 2014 sipma et al 2003 however it seems that both acetogenic and hydrogenogenic co oxidizing pathways were active at ph 9 in our study equations 1 and 2 which was also supported by the thermodynamic analysis as seen in fig s2 a the maximum accumulated h2 during the batch experiments was corresponded to the conversion of around 25 of co it should be noted that the actual value of produced h2 from co might be higher than the above value since h2 might be produced and consumed simultaneously however in both phases ii and iii h2 was not detected as an intermediate indicating hydrogenogenic co oxidizing pathway might be inhibited in this case the methane production in reactor s day 41 71 was much lower than that in phase i therefore the lower methane production could be attributed to both higher ph and the possible inhibition of hydrogenogenic co oxidizing pathway the increased ch4 production was observed after h2 was injected at ph 9 5 from day 72 to day 102 and the presence of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis at ph 9 and 9 5 were also confirmed by microbial community analysis as discussed later therefore the inhibition of hydrogenogenic co oxidizing pathway might be the main reason for lower methane production from co at ph 9 5 day 41 to day 71 compared with ph 9 since there might be no h2 available for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis from day 41 to day 71 further experiments also showed the inhibition of hydrogenogenic co oxidizing pathway at ph 9 5 with the addition of chloroform to inhibit the activities of homoacetogens during the batch experiments liu et al 2016 fig s3 the above results showed that ph affected the co conversion pathways and ph 9 5 and 10 were beneficial for the acetate production from solely co by anaerobic fermentation compared with ph 9 further study could also be conducted to test whether the increase of ph to higher than 10 can facilitate acetate production since the existing hydroxide ions might neutralize more produced protons 1 4co 2h2o ch3coo h 2co2 g o 44 kj mol co 2 co h2o h2 co2 g o 20 kj mol co 3 3 sensitivity to acetate as shown in table 1 the maximum concentration of acetate was around 135 mm in phase iii and generally the high concentrations of products could be inhibitory for the fermentation process agler et al 2012 joblin and naylor 1993 therefore the activity tests for co and h2 were conducted under different acetate concentrations 0 300 mm using the sludge obtained from reactor s in phase iii as shown in fig 2 the maximum specific activities for the consumption of co and h2 were obtained when no acetate was present slight decreases of specific activities for the consumption of co and h2 were observed when the initial acetate concentration was increased from 0 mm to 150 mm and later sharp decreases of specific activities for the consumption of co and h2 were observed with the increase of initial acetate concentration from 200 mm to 300 mm the above results showed that acetate had negative effects on the conversion of co and h2 and therefore the removal of acetate from the liquid was necessary to achieve high co and h2 conversion rates the conversion rates of co and h2 in phase iii in the reactor s were also calculated and they were 5 71 mm gvss d for co and 5 86 mm gvss d for h2 since the acetate concentration in phase iii was 135 mm the specific activities for the consumption of co and h2 should be higher than that at acetate concentration 150 mm 16 7 mm gvss d for co and 24 3 mm gvss d for h2 as shown in fig 2 the much lower values in the continuous reactors might be related with the gas liquid mass transfer since in the batch experiment intensive mixing was applied and therefore the limitation of the gas liquid mass transfer could be ignored it also indicated that reactor s still had high potential to efficiently convert syngas moreover co2 might also affect the acetate production from co since it was a final product as seen in equation 1 which deserves further investigation 3 4 microbial community compositions as revealed by hts of 16 s rrna genes in total 17 samples were collected from the reactors and also the raw was during the whole operational periods rectanglar cladogram based on bray curtis similarity matrices was used to reveal the differences of the microbial community compositions among the samples fig 3 which took into account the abundance of sequences in each otu luo et al 2013 the replicate samples obtained from the reactors were generally clustered together indicating the stable microbial community compositions during the steady states of the reactors in each phase in addition the samples obtained at the same ph from both reactors c and s were clustered together while was was separated from all the other samples similar results were also obtained as seen in fig s4 based on otu analysis with both bray curtis and hellinger similarity matrix in addition pca based on otu analysis at 0 03 distance also showed similar results fig s5 the above results clearly showed that ph seems to be the most important factor determining the dynamics of the microbial community compositions for reactors c and s during the whole operational periods the increase of ph resulted in the increase of the relative abundances of firmicutes e g 35 37 at ph 9 46 63 at ph 9 5 and 65 86 at ph 10 fig s6 which also showed that ph played important role in shaping microbial community compositions a previous study also showed fermentation at ph 9 and 10 resulted in obvious differences in the microbial community compositions during the anaerobic fermentation of the mixture of primary sludge and was maspolim et al 2015 it was possible that the microbial community compositions at different ph might already contained the bacteria that could convert co and h2 e g it was found h2 could be converted to acetate during the fermentation of was at ph 10 and mesophilic condition in our previous study wan et al 2016 therefore the addition of syngas might not change the microbial community compositions significantly as compared to ph methanogens belong to the phylum euryarchaeota karakashev et al 2005 and the dynamics of this phylum determined the efficiencies of acetate production by the anaerobic fermentation of syngas higher relative abundances 2 96 and 3 07 of euryarchaeota in 9sc1 and 9sc2 were observed compared with 9c1 and 9c2 1 13 and 1 51 which was consistent with the higher methane production in reactor s than reactor c in phase i as shown in fig s7 almost all methanogens belonged to the hydrogenotrophic order methanobacteriales for all the samples previous studies also showed there were species e g methanobacterium alcaliphilum methanobacterium subterraneurn belonging to methanobacteriales that can grow at alkaline conditions kotelnikova et al 1998 worakit et al 1986 the above results indicated the methane produced in the current study was via hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis it was also consistent with fig s2 that h2 was an intermediate during co conversion in phase i the increase of ph to 9 5 from day 41 to day 71 resulted in decreased relative abundances 0 45 and 0 42 of euryarchaeota and decreased methane production in reactor s which might be mainly due to the changes of metabolic pathway of co from both hydrogenogenic and acetogenic co oxidizing pathways to only acetogenic co oxidizing pathway as previously mentioned and therefore there was no h2 for methane production when co n2 co2 was changed to co h2 co2 from day 72 obvious increase of the relative abundances 2 96 and 3 07 of euryarchaeota and higher methane production was observed indicating hydrogenotrophic methanogens could be enriched even at ph 9 5 further increase of ph to 10 in phase iii resulted in the lowest relative abundances of euryarchaeota suggesting ph 10 could inhibit the growth of hydrogenotrophic methanogens and therefore co and h2 can be efficiently converted to acetate the present study showed that ph 10 was optimal for efficient acetate production from syngas and was therefore the microbial community compositions in both reactors c and s were compared to reveal the effects of syngas on the microbial community compositions in the anaerobic fermentation of was the higher relative abundances of firmicutes in reactor s around 85 was observed compared with reactor c around 65 fig s6 indicating the addition of syngas resulted in the enrichment of firmicutes in fact previous studies also showed that homoacetogens and acetogenic co oxidizing bacteria belonged to this phylum drake et al 2006 treu et al 2016 the results of genus level classification are shown in fig 4 the genus natronincola and desulfitispora were obviously enriched in reactor s with relative abundances higher than 15 while they were all below 0 5 in reactor c the genus natronincola contains alkaliphilic acetogens that could convert h2 co2 to acetate zhilina et al 1998 and therefore its enrichment was related with the conversion of h2 the genus desulfitispora could ferment carbohydrates under alkaliphilic condition sorokin and muyzer 2010 but it has not been reported for the ability to produce acetate from either h2 or co table s1 lists the known mesophilic co converting microorganisms to date most of the known mesophilic co converting microorganisms are neutrophilic except alkalibaculum bacchi which can grow in the range of 6 5 10 5 allen et al 2010 however they were not found or enriched in reactor s indicating there might be other unknown bacteria playing important roles for co conversion as shown in fig 4 it can be seen more than 40 sequences could not be classified which might be related with the unknown bacteria for co conversion venn diagram based on otu at 0 03 distance showed that 361 otus were shared by the samples obtained from reactors c and s accounting for 16 of the total otus fig s8 the shared otus which were enriched in reactor s and the unique otus in reactor s were analyzed as shown in table 2 and table s2 only otu1 unique had high similarity 97 to the known acetogen clostridium formicaceticum drake et al 2008 most of the other otus listed in table 2 had high similarity with known alkaliphilic bacteria alkaliphilus transvaalensis desulfitispora alkaliphila anaerobranca californiensis anaerobranca gottschalkii which grow heterotrophically gorlenko et al 2004 prowe and antranikian 2001 sorokin and muyzer 2010 takai et al 2001 the above bacteria might be responsible for the was acidification and their enrichment in reactor s might be due to the selection by syngas the above results clearly showed that the addition of syngas not only resulted in the enrichment of certain bacteria for syngas conversion but also induced the changes of microbial community compositions degrading was by comparison to that in reactor c 3 5 dynamics of key microbial populations as revealed by qpcr analysis fig 5 shows the concentrations of total bacteria methanogens and acetogens in all the samples at all operational periods the concentrations of total bacteria were higher in reactor s than that in reactor c which was due to the addition of syngas it is worth mentioning that the increased concentration of bacteria in reactor s did not result in the obvious increase of vss concentrations compared with reactor c table 1 which could be due to that vss in the present study mainly represent the organic contents in was and the concentrations of bacteria might only contribute to very small amount of vss for methanogens the concentrations of mbt were obviously much higher than mmb msc and mst when there was obvious methane production in the reactors e g samples 9c 9sc 9 5sch and 9 5schr the result was consistent with that from hts of 16 s rrna genes and indicated hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis played an important role for methane production during alkaline fermentation and ph at 10 could inhibit the growth of methanogens it was known acetogens mediated the acetate production from h2 co2 and it was also reported most acetogens could also utilize co drake et al 2006 luo et al 2011 therefore the concentrations of acetogens were also determined increased concentrations of acetogens were observed in 9sc compared with 9c since only co n2 co2 was injected in phase i the enrichment of acetogens might be related with the conversion of co in phase ii and iii the injected gas was changed to co h2 co2 further increase of acetogens were observed which indicated acetogens were responsible for the acetate production from both co and h2 the enrichment of acetogens in reactor s was also demonstrated by hts of 16 s rrna genes as previously mentioned 3 6 prospects a proof of concept for simultaneous conversion of was and syngas to vfa mainly acetate by mesophilic alkaline fermentation at ph 10 was demonstrated in the present study the integration of was and syngas for vfa production is a new concept which could achieve full conversion of organics in was into vfa by integrating biological and thermochemical technologies in addition it was demonstrated that co can be bio converted to acetate under ph 10 by anaerobic mixed culture for the first time which provides new knowledge for co fermentation the present study was conducted in lab scale reactors which was mainly used to demonstrate the feasibility of the new concept and therefore more efforts should be made to accelerate its industrial application first both co and h2 have low solubility and therefore gas liquid mass transfer is the limiting step for their efficient conversion luo et al 2013 gas recirculation was adopted in the present study and other methods hollow fiber membrane high pressure fermentation are deserved to be tested in the future to explore the most efficient method in real application munasinghe and khanal 2012 second the efficient conversion of both co and h2 can result in the high concentration of acetate in the fermentation broth which will have inhibition on their conversion therefore in situ extraction of acetate is necessary and the combination of anaerobic fermentation with in situ electrodialysis for acetate recovery might be a promising technology wang et al 2012 deserving further study in addition syngas not only contains co h2 co2 but also contains tar which is a complex mixture including benzene toluene xylene and so on phuphuakrat et al 2010 the effects of tar on the mesophilic alkaline fermentation remain to be elucidated the control of ph at 10 during the mesophilic alkaline fermentation process requires the addition of alkali although the present study used naoh for ph adjustment ca oh 2 should be used in practice considering its low cost 75 us ton ca oh 2 vs 284 us ton naoh wan et al 2016 a previous study made a rough estimation on the mesophilic alkaline fermentation for vfa production from was and it showed that the cost of consumed ca oh 2 and the value of produced vfa were 11 2 us ton was and 40 us ton was respectively li et al 2014 therefore the total cost saving was around 28 8 us ton was in the present study more vfa was produced considering the conversion of syngas and therefore more alkali would be required to neutralize the additional vfa mainly acetate production from syngas based on equation 3 it can be calculated that 1 ton additional acetate production would require 0 62 ton additional ca oh 2 addition the total cost saving should be 454 us ton acetate based on the prices of acetate 500 us ton for acetate to be used as the internal carbon sources for denitrification and ca oh 2 75 us ton from a previous literature li et al 2014 the above results showed the novel process for vfa production from syngas by integrating with mesophilic alkaline fermentation of was would be both technically and economically feasible it should be noted that previous studies also showed that it was possible to produce alcohols valuable biofuels by the reduction of acetate with h2 under high pressures 1 5 bar steinbusch et al 2008 2009 however alcohols were not detected in the present study and it might be due to the unfavorable conditions e g low hydrogen pressure and the presence of co which deserves further study to directly produce alcohols from was and syngas 3 2ch3cooh ca oh 2 ch3coo 2ca 2h2o 4 conclusions a new concept for the vfa production from syngas by integrating with mesophilic alkaline fermentation of was was demonstrated in the present study methane production from co was observed at ph 9 due to the presence of hydrogenogenic pathway for co conversion while it was inhibited when ph was increased from 9 to 9 5 due to the possible presence of only acetogenic pathway for co conversion however h2 contained in syngas was still converted to methane even at ph 9 5 by hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanobacteriales the control of ph at 10 was necessary to inhibit methane production from syngas to efficiently produce vfa mainly acetate it was also found that high acetate concentration 150 mm had negative effects on the conversion of syngas microbial community analysis further showed that the addition of syngas induced the changes of microbial community for the fermentation of was at ph 10 and some known bacteria relating with syngas conversion were also identified acknowledgement we acknowledge the

19583,the aim of the study was to develop predictive models of the ecological status of rivers by using artificial neural networks the relationships between five macrophyte indices and the combined impact of water pollution as well as hydromorphological degradation were examined the dataset consisted of hydromorphologically modified rivers representing a wide water quality gradient three ecological status indices namely the macrophyte index for rivers mir the macrophyte biological index for rivers ibmr and the river macrophyte nutrient index rmni were tested moreover two diversity indices species richness n and the simpson index d were tested physico chemical parameters reflecting both water quality and hydromorphological status were utilized as explanatory variables for the artificial neural networks the best modelling quality in terms of high values of coefficients of determination and low values of the normalized root mean square error was obtained for the rmni and the mir networks the networks constructed for ibmr species richness and the simpson index showed a lower degree of fit in all cases modelling quality improved by adding two hydromorphological indices to the pool of explanatory variables the significant effect of these indices in the models was confirmed by sensitivity analysis the research showed that ecological assessment of rivers based on macrophyte metrics does not only reflect the water quality but also the hydromorphological status graphical abstract image keywords habitat quality hydromorphological status macrophytes multilayer

comparable to other endangered ecosystems i e polar areas tropical forests and coastal ecosystems in order to limit increasing water quantity and quality problems the european union has developed the water framework directive wfd directive 2000 60 ec which introduced a new ecological approach to water management according to the wfd monitoring of surface waters should primarily be assessed by

communities hilton et al 2006 kolada et al 2014 o hare et al 2010 this dependence was used in the development of water assessment systems which indicate the degree of eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems or more general the degree of degradation whereby eutrophication is the key stressor of the system birk et al 2012 many studies showed that besides eutrophication several other factors significantly influence development and dynamics of aquatic vegetation bornette and puijalon 2011 among which one of the most important are consequences of altered hydromorphology asaeda et al 2017

the aim of the study was to develop predictive models of ecological status of rivers using artificial neural networks the study focuses on aquatic plant variation under the combined impact of water pollution and hydromorphological degradation it was also intended to confirm the impact of multiple pressures on the ecological status of rivers the predictive modelling of the reaction of the community under two simultaneously changing variables was a challenging aspect of this study 2 material and methods 2 1 site selection analysis of data took place in 200 survey sites located in polish rivers fig 1 only hydromorphologically modified river sections were included in the study survey sites were situated mostly in urban or suburban areas as well as in industrial and intensively used agricultural land use the vast majority of the study sites postglacial or recent alluvial origin as reflected the soil types present at the banks and in the flood plain an inventory of aquatic vegetation a hydromorphological assessment and an analysis of physicochemical parameters of water was carried out at all sites the water quality samples were collected during the macrophyte growth period june to august avoiding more extreme weather periods heavy precipitation and droughts events 2 2 macrophyte survey vegetation studies were conducted according to the standard protocol used in environmental monitoring in poland macrophyte index for rivers mir szoszkiewicz et al 2010 all macrophytes growing in the water over a distance of 100 m were listed and coverage of each species was estimated based on the field data three indices of the ecological status of rivers were calculated besides the macrophyte index for rivers mir szoszkiewicz et al 2010 two additional european indices were used the macrophyte biological index for rivers ibmr haury et al 2006 and the river macrophyte nutrient index rmni willby et al 2009 these three indices have been developed primarily for the detection of river eutrophication mir rmni or combined trophic and organic pollution ibmr these indices are widely used and have been compared for their utility to assess rivers on the basis of macrophytes birk and willby 2010 wiegleb et al 2016 these indices are based on the coverage of macrophytes using five ibmr or nine grade mir rmni scale and indicator numbers which reflect their assumed relationship to an average level of the water trophy and the tolerance to this factor furthermore two diversity indices were used species richness n was counted and the simpson index d simpson 1949 was calculated the basic statistics of all calculated macrophyte indices were presented in table 1 2 3 hydromorphological assessment hydromorphological assessment of the rivers was conducted in accordance with the river habitat survey method rhs raven et al 1998 adapted to polish conditions szoszkiewicz et al 2012 river habitat survey is a system of assessment of river habitats taking into account the morphology of the river bed the level of its transformation and the occurrence of natural elements it also describes the use of the flood plain in the immediate vicinity of a river within a distance of 50 m research on the basis of the rhs system has been introduced to obtain habitat data in studies on various groups of aquatic organisms e g błachuta et al 2014 szoszkiewicz et al 2006 data collected during rhs field survey table 2 were used to calculate the synthetic hydromorphological indices raven et al 1998 they are composed of many parameters and allow presenting the hydromorphological condition of the river section in numerical form two indicators were calculated in this paper hqa habitat quality assessment and hms habitat modification score raven et al 1998 they were subsequently used in the artificial neural networks by using these indices which include information both on naturalness hqa and the degree of alteration hms it was possible to limit the number of hydromorphological variables in this paper we focused on heavily transformed sections of rivers belonging to the fourth and fifth class lowest value of the hydromorphological status according to rhs method 2 4 physicochemical analysis twelve physicochemical parameters were analysed in each water sample table 2 the selected rivers represent a wide trophic gradient occurring in poland mainly as to phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations 2 5 artificial neural network modelling prior to neural network learning input variables were analysed for collinearity to eliminate variables that were correlated with one another for this purpose the pearson correlation coefficient r was calculated for all pairs of variables removal of collinear variables from the model removes the redundant information with unchanged model error what simplifies the model s structure with unchanged prediction quality dormann et al 2013 for modelling of macrophyte indices multilayer perceptron mlp with backpropagation algorithm a supervised type of artificial neural network was used statsoft 2017 this type of network is widely used in modelling of non linear relationships gebler et al 2017 lek and park 2008 park and lek 2016 rocha et al 2017 wiegleb et al 2014 for each of the modelled indices output variables two neural networks were developed input variables neurons of the first network consisted of 10 parameters of water quality fig 2 a in the second network 12 input parameters were used hqa and hms indices were added fig 2b the number of hidden neurons ranged from 2n1 2 m to 2n m where n is the number of input neurons and m the number of output neurons in each of the respective variants fletcher and goss 1993 in the ann models the database was randomly divided into three independent subsets namely training validation and testing dataset for the training dataset 70 of the research cases 140 river sites were selected for the validation as well as the testing dataset 15 of the research cases were used 30 sites each the testing dataset was used only for anns evaluation and it was not available for learning process this procedure guaranteed independence of data in the learning and testing phase due to the different ranges input and output variables table 2 were standardized park and lek 2016 for this purpose the auto scaling method eq 5 was used for input variables and min max normalization for modelled variables in which the value was scaled to the range of 0 1 0 9 eq 6 5 z i x i μ σ where x i i th value of each physico chemical and hydromorphological variable z i i th standardized value of the variable μ the mean of the variable σ the standard deviation of the variable 6 y i y i y min y max y min y min y max y min where y i i th value of output variable macrophyte indices y i i th normalized value of output variable y min y max minimum and maximum value of output variable y min y max minimum and maximum normalized value of output variable the quality of each network was assessed using the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square error rmse and the standardized root mean square error nrmse calculated on the basis of values of indices derived from botanical survey and the models the following equations were used 7 r 2 1 i 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 8 r m s e i 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 n 9 n r m s e r m s e y max y min where y ˆ i i th normalized value of output variable derived from the models y i the mean of empirical value of each output variable n number of repetitions based on the study of moriasi et al 2007 we made the assumption that acceptable thresholds of the quality of networks in our study are values of the coefficient of determination higher than 0 7 and values of the normalized root mean square error less than 15 2 6 sensitivity analysis evaluation of the impact of individual input variables on modelled indices was performed using sensitivity analysis it evaluates how important the particular variable is for a statistical model nourani and fard 2012 park and lek 2016 the value obtained for each variable is the quotient of the neural network error without this variable to the network error with the set of explanatory variables input variables that are assigned values close to or less than 1 do not contribute relevant information to the network 3 results 3 1 collinearity of predictors the correlation analysis table 3 showed a strong correlation r 0 70 between the concentration of reactive and total phosphorus r 0 74 and between the concentration of organic and total nitrogen r 0 83 on this basis reactive phosphorus and total nitrogen were excluded from the group of input variables 3 2 model quality the model quality analysis focused on evaluating the prediction statistics values for the testing dataset for each modelled index and each scenario 10 and 12 input variables one network with the lowest mean square error and the highest determination coefficient was chosen comparison of the models quality for the three datasets used in the neural networks learning is presented in table 4 a comparison of the values of the five macrophyte indices is presented in figs 3 7 analyses showed that the networks modelled mir and rmni were characterized by the highest quality for the mir network which based on the input variables describing the water quality the value of the coefficient of determination for the test procedure was 0 632 what proved of the explanation of more than 60 variance of the modelled variable with the normalized mean squared error value of 13 1 the quality of the mir modelling for the second network supplemented by the hydromorphological indices was higher than that of the first network and it showed the relation of mir with hydromorphological status of rivers there was a greater percentage of variance explained by the model on each of the stages of network learning while lowering the value of errors the value of the coefficient of determination in the network testing process increased to 0 702 while the error of the model decreased by 1 3 for the test procedure and equalled 11 8 networks for the rmni based on physico chemical parameters of water were characterized by the similar quality in the comparison with the mir model the coefficient of determination in the network testing process was slightly lower and equalled 0 601 and the error was slightly higher 12 3 the impact of the added value of the hydromorphological indices in the second rmni network was shown again the determination coefficient for the test procedure increased to 0 715 while the error decreased to 10 4 in terms of these statistics this network was characterized by the highest quality of modelling of all networks analysed for the last index of the ecological status assessment the ibmr the quality of the models both in terms of the determination s coefficient and the normalized mean square error was lower than for the mir and rmni in spite of the relatively low quality of the network the influence of hqa and hms indices in the second model was also noticeable the value of the coefficient of determination has increased and the error has decreased this shows that imbr is also related to the hydromorphological status of rivers but the group of all selected input variables did not allow for accurate modelling relatively low quality was obtained for the networks modelling species richness and the simpson diversity index in both cases models based on physicochemical variables explained slightly about 25 of variances of the modelled variable with rmse that was about 25 the second network modelled species diversity was characterized by slightly higher quality as a result of adding two hydromorphological indices the second network modelling simpson index reached similar quality to the first one only in this case impacts of hqa and hms on the modelled values of this index were not observed 3 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis tables 5 and 6 appendix i tables a1 a2 showed that conductivity had the highest impact on the macrophyte index values in all networks for networks of the highest modelling quality rmni and mir the removal of this variable from the two networks would cause an increase of the error from over 1 5 to over 2 5 times for the two remaining indices ibmr and d the values of the conductivity in the sensitivity analysis are lower like values of most of the input variables this is the result of the low modelling quality in networks supplemented by the hydromorphological indices a significant effect on the values of the modelled indices was shown hms was the most important input variable in the rmni and mir models the impact of hqa was lower but this variable was one of the most important ones in the second network additionally besides conductivity hms and hqa the group of variables presenting the water quality in terms of trophy e g total phosphorus and organic nitrogen and alkalinity had also major influence on the modelled macrophyte indices in both groups of networks for the remaining predictors the values were around 1 indicating their low impact on the models hence it can be stated that mainly the concentration of the ammonium nitrogen dissolved oxygen and ph did not add much information to the neural networks for ibmr species richness and simpson diversity low values were generally obtained in sensitivity analysis for most input variables this indicates a negligible impact on the models which corresponds to the low quality of these neural networks 4 discussion artificial neural networks were successfully used for the modelling of macrophyte indices values under two simultaneously changing groups of variables the physicochemical parameters of water and the hydromorphological conditions modelling quality of the networks for rmni and mir can be considered as satisfactory see moriasi et al 2007 a comparable quality of ann models was found in ecological studies of various organism groups e g olaya marín et al 2013 wu et al 2014 zhu et al 2018 the quality of modelling was sometimes even higher but most of these cases were concerned with the study of lake ecosystems heddam 2016 xiao et al 2017 or less complex relations bui et al 2017 rocha et al 2017 singh et al 2009 the ecological relationships faced in rivers however are more complex as compared to lakes hering et al 2010 nevertheless our investigation showed higher modelling quality than other methods used for macrophyte index prediction segurado et al 2018 so far the results are limited to this kind of postglacial areas and this kind of altered streams generalizations beyond these frame conditions are not possible at the moment however it can be expected that a similar ann approach will also work in other physiographic regions and other river types our study proved that river degradation is better reflected by the concept of ecological status than by the biodiversity pattern anns for ecological status indices mir rmni and ibmr indicated higher quality then biodiversity index networks simpson index and species richness the calculation of the ecological status metrics considers the environmental tolerance of developing taxa by utilising their numerical indicator values which is a well established approach originated almost 50 years ago by ellenberg in germany ellenberg 1979 ellenberg et al 1991 by this the three ecological status indices were closely related to habitat variables hydromorphological and hydrochemical improving the modelling quality on the other hand low quality models based on simpson biodiversity index and species richness confirmed limited value of diversity indices in biological monitoring hering et al 2006 staniszewski et al 2006 thiebaut et al 2002 since the highest diversity is usually recorded with a moderate degree of degradation connell 1978 analysis based on ann revealed strong relationship between conductivity and vegetation the identified role of conductivity was most probably the result of the indirect relationship with macrophytes resulting from the correlation of conductivity with other water quality parameters both with nutrients and alkalinity which is a common pattern in running waters of europe demars and thiébaut 2008 jusik et al 2015 szoszkiewicz et al 2006 wiegleb et al 2015 conductivity as well as ph and alkalinity are regarded as factors related with the geological conditions but conductivity is also a factor representing impacted sites together with phosphorous and nitrogen schaumburg et al 2004 nutrients are recognised as the main hydrochemical factor responsible for the development of various macrophyte taxa hilton et al 2006 szoszkiewicz et al 2006 detected dependences between plants and physicochemical parameters reflect wider ecological pattern occurring in rivers it illustrates the biological response to degradation at the catchment scale water quality reflects a number of influences of catchment both inflow of sewage as well as spatial factors reflecting landforms and land use within the surrounding valley at multiple scales allan 2004 bornette and puijalon 2011 hering et al 2006 land use of the river valley and catchment can also strongly correspond to the river hydromorphological status webb sullivan and evans 2014 the importance of hydromorphological factor in macrophyte development was confirmed since the highest quality of models was reached when physical habitat variables were considered hydromorphological modifications can affect the vegetation development in different ways and it is still the subject of many studies baattrup pedersen et al 2016 jusik et al 2015 kupilas et al 2017 hydromorphological degradation can be detected by the biological indicators of ecological status haury et al 2006 steffen et al 2014 by applying ann in this study the variability of ecological status metrics under the joint effect of water quality and physical habitat was estimated thus the neural networks modelling method used in the study confirmed of being a very effective tool to investigate the relationships between various environmental variables and organisms this approach is consistent with current research on the influence of multiple factors on aquatic organisms baattrup pedersen et al 2016 hering et al 2015 liao et al 2018 high

19583,the aim of the study was to develop predictive models of the ecological status of rivers by using artificial neural networks the relationships between five macrophyte indices and the combined impact of water pollution as well as hydromorphological degradation were examined the dataset consisted of hydromorphologically modified rivers representing a wide water quality gradient three ecological status indices namely the macrophyte index for rivers mir the macrophyte biological index for rivers ibmr and the river macrophyte nutrient index rmni were tested moreover two diversity indices species richness n and the simpson index d were tested physico chemical parameters reflecting both water quality and hydromorphological status were utilized as explanatory variables for the artificial neural networks the best modelling quality in terms of high values of coefficients of determination and low values of the normalized root mean square error was obtained for the rmni and the mir networks the networks constructed for ibmr species richness and the simpson index showed a lower degree of fit in all cases modelling quality improved by adding two hydromorphological indices to the pool of explanatory variables the significant effect of these indices in the models was confirmed by sensitivity analysis the research showed that ecological assessment of rivers based on macrophyte metrics does not only reflect the water quality but also the hydromorphological status graphical abstract image keywords habitat quality hydromorphological status macrophytes multilayer perceptron multiple stressors water framework directive 1 introduction inland waters have undergone extensive degradation over several decades as a result of chemical pollution physical transformation of habitats climate change and biological invasions dudgeon et al 2006 moss 2008 moss 2008 even assumed that in the coming years the impact of degradation pressures on freshwaters will increase comparable to other endangered ecosystems i e polar areas tropical forests and coastal ecosystems in order to limit increasing water quantity and quality problems the european union has developed the water framework directive wfd directive 2000 60 ec which introduced a new ecological approach to water management according to the wfd monitoring of surface waters should primarily be assessed by indicative reaction of aquatic organisms in practice this reaction is observed through changes in the values of biological indices metrics in the ideal case there should be an integrated approach for water resources management indicating all water related impacts hering et al 2006 sánchez montoya et al 2012 to date almost three hundred indices have been developed across the european union utilising different groups of aquatic indicator organisms birk et al 2012 aquatic plants belong to those groups of organisms which have been used for water assessment for decades ellenberg 1979 haslam 1978 holmes 1983 previous studies have clearly shown that the trophic status of water is a main factor determining distribution and abundance of individual macrophyte species and the composition of communities hilton et al 2006 kolada et al 2014 o hare et al 2010 this dependence was used in the development of water assessment systems which indicate the degree of eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems or more general the degree of degradation whereby eutrophication is the key stressor of the system birk et al 2012 many studies showed that besides eutrophication several other factors significantly influence development and dynamics of aquatic vegetation bornette and puijalon 2011 among which one of the most important are consequences of altered hydromorphology asaeda et al 2017 baattrup pedersen et al 2016 hering et al 2010 it is assumed that understanding the ecological consequences of physical habitat degradation would help to achieve sustainable approaches to management of aquatic systems colas et al 2017 hering et al 2006 various natural and anthropogenic trophic and non trophic factors affecting aquatic biota may interact enhancing the negative environmental impact or having different non additive effects i e antagonistic synergistic or inert oehlmann and markert 1999 both knowledge about the importance of single factors and their interactions in a group of factors are crucial to their efficient use in ecological status assessment hering et al 2015 moss 2010 the accumulation of ecological knowledge as a background for biological monitoring is particularly important in flowing waters due to the high complexity of riverine ecosystems hering et al 2010 analysis of complex non linear relationships observed in aquatic ecosystems does not only require comprehensive environmental studies but also the usage of appropriate analytical tools facilitating data interpretation hobbs and hilborn 2006 advanced data analysis techniques such as genetic

the aim of the study was to develop predictive models of ecological status of rivers using artificial neural networks the study focuses on aquatic plant variation under the combined impact of water pollution and hydromorphological degradation it was also intended to confirm the impact of multiple pressures on the ecological status of rivers the predictive modelling of the reaction of the community under two simultaneously changing variables was a challenging aspect of this study 2 material and methods 2 1 site selection analysis of data took place in 200 survey sites located in polish rivers fig 1 only hydromorphologically modified river sections were included in the study survey sites were situated mostly in urban or suburban areas as well as in industrial and intensively used agricultural land use the vast majority of the study sites postglacial or recent alluvial origin as reflected the soil types present at the banks and in the flood plain an inventory of aquatic vegetation a hydromorphological assessment and an analysis of physicochemical parameters of water was carried out at all sites the water quality samples were collected during the macrophyte growth period june to august avoiding more extreme weather periods heavy precipitation and droughts events 2 2 macrophyte survey vegetation studies were conducted according to the standard protocol used in environmental monitoring in poland macrophyte index for rivers mir szoszkiewicz et al 2010 all macrophytes growing in the water over a distance of 100 m were listed and coverage of each species was estimated based on the field data three indices of the ecological status of rivers were calculated besides the macrophyte index for rivers mir szoszkiewicz et al 2010 two additional european indices were used the macrophyte biological index for rivers ibmr haury et al 2006 and the river macrophyte nutrient index rmni willby et al 2009 these three indices have been developed primarily for the detection of river eutrophication mir rmni or combined trophic and organic pollution ibmr these indices are widely used and have been compared for their utility to assess rivers on the basis of macrophytes birk and willby 2010 wiegleb et al 2016 these indices are based on the coverage of macrophytes using five ibmr or nine grade mir rmni scale and indicator numbers which reflect their assumed relationship to an average level of the water trophy and the tolerance to this factor furthermore two diversity indices were used species richness n was counted and the simpson index d simpson 1949 was calculated the basic statistics of all calculated macrophyte indices were presented in table 1 2 3 hydromorphological assessment hydromorphological assessment of the rivers was conducted in accordance with the river habitat survey method rhs raven et al 1998 adapted to polish conditions szoszkiewicz et al 2012 river habitat survey is a system of assessment of river habitats taking into account the morphology of the river bed the level of its transformation and the occurrence of natural elements it also describes the use of the flood plain in the immediate vicinity of a river within a distance of 50 m research on the basis of the rhs system has been introduced to obtain habitat data in studies on various groups of aquatic organisms e g błachuta et al 2014 szoszkiewicz et al 2006 data collected during rhs field survey table 2 were used to calculate the synthetic hydromorphological indices raven et al 1998 they are composed of many parameters and allow presenting the hydromorphological condition of the river section in numerical form two indicators were calculated in this paper hqa habitat quality assessment and hms habitat modification score raven et al 1998 they were subsequently used in the artificial neural networks by using these indices which include information both on naturalness hqa and the degree of alteration hms it was possible to limit the number of hydromorphological variables in this paper we focused on heavily transformed sections of rivers belonging to the fourth and fifth class lowest value of the hydromorphological status according to rhs method 2 4 physicochemical analysis twelve physicochemical parameters were analysed in each water sample table 2 the selected rivers represent a wide trophic gradient occurring in poland mainly as to phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations 2 5 artificial neural network modelling prior to neural network learning input variables were analysed for collinearity to eliminate variables that were correlated with one another for this purpose the pearson correlation coefficient r was calculated for all pairs of variables removal of collinear variables from the model removes the redundant information with unchanged model error what simplifies the model s structure with unchanged prediction quality dormann et al 2013 for modelling of macrophyte indices multilayer perceptron mlp with backpropagation algorithm a supervised type of artificial neural network was used statsoft 2017 this type of network is widely used in modelling of non linear relationships gebler et al 2017 lek and park 2008 park and lek 2016 rocha et al 2017 wiegleb et al 2014 for each of the modelled indices output variables two neural networks were developed input variables neurons of the first network consisted of 10 parameters of water quality fig 2 a in the second network 12 input parameters were used hqa and hms indices were added fig 2b the number of hidden neurons ranged from 2n1 2 m to 2n m where n is the number of input neurons and m the number of output neurons in each of the respective variants fletcher and goss 1993 in the ann models the database was randomly divided into three independent subsets namely training validation and testing dataset for the training dataset 70 of the research cases 140 river sites were selected for the validation as well as the testing dataset 15 of the research cases were used 30 sites each the testing dataset was used only for anns evaluation and it was not available for learning process this procedure guaranteed independence of data in the learning and testing phase due to the different ranges input and output variables table 2 were standardized park and lek 2016 for this purpose the auto scaling method eq 5 was used for input variables and min max normalization for modelled variables in which the value was scaled to the range of 0 1 0 9 eq 6 5 z i x i μ σ where x i i th value of each physico chemical and hydromorphological variable z i i th standardized value of the variable μ the mean of the variable σ the standard deviation of the variable 6 y i y i y min y max y min y min y max y min where y i i th value of output variable macrophyte indices y i i th normalized value of output variable y min y max minimum and maximum value of output variable y min y max minimum and maximum normalized value of output variable the quality of each network was assessed using the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square error rmse and the standardized root mean square error nrmse calculated on the basis of values of indices derived from botanical survey and the models the following equations were used 7 r 2 1 i 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 8 r m s e i 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 n 9 n r m s e r m s e y max y min where y ˆ i i th normalized value of output variable derived from the models y i the mean of empirical value of each output variable n number of repetitions based on the study of moriasi et al 2007 we made the assumption that acceptable thresholds of the quality of networks in our study are values of the coefficient of determination higher than 0 7 and values of the normalized root mean square error less than 15 2 6 sensitivity analysis evaluation of the impact of individual input variables on modelled indices was performed using sensitivity analysis it evaluates how important the particular variable is for a statistical model nourani and fard 2012 park and lek 2016 the value obtained for each variable is the quotient of the neural network error without this variable to the network error with the set of explanatory variables input variables that are assigned values close to or less than 1 do not contribute relevant information to the network 3 results 3 1 collinearity of predictors the correlation analysis table 3 showed a strong correlation r 0 70 between the concentration of reactive and total phosphorus r 0 74 and between the concentration of organic and total nitrogen r 0 83 on this basis reactive phosphorus and total nitrogen were excluded from the group of input variables 3 2 model quality the model quality analysis focused on evaluating the prediction statistics values for the testing dataset for each modelled index and each scenario 10 and 12 input variables one network with the lowest mean square error and the highest determination coefficient was chosen comparison of the models quality for the three datasets used in the neural networks learning is presented in table 4 a comparison of the values of the five macrophyte indices is presented in figs 3 7 analyses showed that the networks modelled mir and rmni were characterized by the highest quality for the mir network which based on the input variables describing the water quality the value of the coefficient of determination for the test procedure was 0 632 what proved of the explanation of more than 60 variance of the modelled variable with the normalized mean squared error value of 13 1 the quality of the mir modelling for the second network supplemented by the hydromorphological indices was higher than that of the first network and it showed the relation of mir with hydromorphological status of rivers there was a greater percentage of variance explained by the model on each of the stages of network learning while lowering the value of errors the value of the coefficient of determination in the network testing process increased to 0 702 while the error of the model decreased by 1 3 for the test procedure and equalled 11 8 networks for the rmni based on physico chemical parameters of water were characterized by the similar quality in the comparison with the mir model the coefficient of determination in the network testing process was slightly lower and equalled 0 601 and the error was slightly higher 12 3 the impact of the added value of the hydromorphological indices in the second rmni network was shown again the determination coefficient for the test procedure increased to 0 715 while the error decreased to 10 4 in terms of these statistics this network was characterized by the highest quality of modelling of all networks analysed for the last index of the ecological status assessment the ibmr the quality of the models both in terms of the determination s coefficient and the normalized mean square error was lower than for the mir and rmni in spite of the relatively low quality of the network the influence of hqa and hms indices in the second model was also noticeable the value of the coefficient of determination has increased and the error has decreased this shows that imbr is also related to the hydromorphological status of rivers but the group of all selected input variables did not allow for accurate modelling relatively low quality was obtained for the networks modelling species richness and the simpson diversity index in both cases models based on physicochemical variables explained slightly about 25 of variances of the modelled variable with rmse that was about 25 the second network modelled species diversity was characterized by slightly higher quality as a result of adding two hydromorphological indices the second network modelling simpson index reached similar quality to the first one only in this case impacts of hqa and hms on the modelled values of this index were not observed 3 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis tables 5 and 6 appendix i tables a1 a2 showed that conductivity had the highest impact on the macrophyte index values in all networks for networks of the highest modelling quality rmni and mir the removal of this variable from the two networks would cause an increase of the error from over 1 5 to over 2 5 times for the two remaining indices ibmr and d the values of the conductivity in the sensitivity analysis are lower like values of most of the input variables this is the result of the low modelling quality in networks supplemented by the hydromorphological indices a significant effect on the values of the modelled indices was shown hms was the most important input variable in the rmni and mir models the impact of hqa was lower but this variable was one of the most important ones in the second network additionally besides conductivity hms and hqa the group of variables presenting the water quality in terms of trophy e g total phosphorus and organic nitrogen and alkalinity had also major influence on the modelled macrophyte indices in both groups of networks for the remaining predictors the values were around 1 indicating their low impact on the models hence it can be stated that mainly the concentration of the ammonium nitrogen dissolved oxygen and ph did not add much information to the neural networks for ibmr species richness and simpson diversity low values were generally obtained in sensitivity analysis for most input variables this indicates a negligible impact on the models which corresponds to the low quality of these neural networks 4 discussion artificial neural networks were successfully used for the modelling of macrophyte indices values under two simultaneously changing groups of variables the physicochemical parameters of water and the hydromorphological conditions modelling quality of the networks for rmni and mir can be considered as satisfactory see moriasi et al 2007 a comparable quality of ann models was found in ecological studies of various organism groups e g olaya marín et al 2013 wu et al 2014 zhu et al 2018 the quality of modelling was sometimes even higher but most of these cases were concerned with the study of lake ecosystems heddam 2016 xiao et al 2017 or less complex relations bui et al 2017 rocha et al 2017 singh et al 2009 the ecological relationships faced in rivers however are more complex as compared to lakes hering et al 2010 nevertheless our investigation showed higher modelling quality than other methods used for macrophyte index prediction segurado et al 2018 so far the results are limited to this kind of postglacial areas and this kind of altered streams generalizations beyond these frame conditions are not possible at the moment however it can be expected that a similar ann approach will also work in other physiographic regions and other river types our study proved that river degradation is better reflected by the concept of ecological status than by the biodiversity pattern anns for ecological status indices mir rmni and ibmr indicated higher quality then biodiversity index networks simpson index and species richness the calculation of the ecological status metrics considers the environmental tolerance of developing taxa by utilising their numerical indicator values which is a well established approach originated almost 50 years ago by ellenberg in germany ellenberg 1979 ellenberg et al 1991 by this the three ecological status indices were closely related to habitat variables hydromorphological and hydrochemical improving the modelling quality on the other hand low quality models based on simpson biodiversity index and species richness confirmed limited value of diversity indices in biological monitoring hering et al 2006 staniszewski et al 2006 thiebaut et al 2002 since the highest diversity is usually recorded with a moderate degree of degradation connell 1978 analysis based on ann revealed strong relationship between conductivity and vegetation the identified role of conductivity was most probably the result of the indirect relationship with macrophytes resulting from the correlation of conductivity with other water quality parameters both with nutrients and alkalinity which is a common pattern in running waters of europe demars and thiébaut 2008 jusik et al 2015 szoszkiewicz et al 2006 wiegleb et al 2015 conductivity as well as ph and alkalinity are regarded as factors related with the geological conditions but conductivity is also a factor representing impacted sites together with phosphorous and nitrogen schaumburg et al 2004 nutrients are recognised as the main hydrochemical factor responsible for the development of various macrophyte taxa hilton et al 2006 szoszkiewicz et al 2006 detected dependences between plants and physicochemical parameters reflect wider ecological pattern occurring in rivers it illustrates the biological response to degradation at the catchment scale water quality reflects a number of influences of catchment both inflow of sewage as well as spatial factors reflecting landforms and land use within the surrounding valley at multiple scales allan 2004 bornette and puijalon 2011 hering et al 2006 land use of the river valley and catchment can also strongly correspond to the river hydromorphological status webb sullivan and evans 2014 the importance of hydromorphological factor in macrophyte development was confirmed since the highest quality of models was reached when physical habitat variables were considered hydromorphological modifications can affect the vegetation development in different ways and it is still the subject of many studies baattrup pedersen et al 2016 jusik et al 2015 kupilas et al 2017 hydromorphological degradation can be detected by the biological indicators of ecological status haury et al 2006 steffen et al 2014 by applying ann in this study the variability of ecological status metrics under the joint effect of water quality and physical habitat was estimated thus the neural networks modelling method used in the study confirmed of being a very effective tool to investigate the relationships between various environmental variables and organisms this approach is consistent with current research on the influence of multiple factors on aquatic organisms baattrup pedersen et al 2016 hering et al 2015 liao et al 2018 high quality ecological models that combine both water quality and hydromorphological conditions as input data well reflected relationships between river degradation and macrophyte pattern the degradation

19584,hexavalent chromium cr vi in drinking water is pending regulation in california and is being considered for regulation in other locations while strong base anion exchange sba ix can efficiently remove cr vi to low levels that may be required to comply with future mcls operational and maintenance o m costs can be considerable if the spent brine is disposed of as hazardous waste through bench and pilot scale experiments and full scale demonstrations this study examined the ability of emerging and established brine treatment and reuse techniques as well as recently developed resins to decrease o m costs when profiling anion elution during regeneration with nanofiltration treated and untreated spent brine it appeared that at least 1 and 3 reuse cycles were feasible respectively stannous and ferrous based reductants were more efficient than sulfur based reductants when treating spent brine bed volumes to 8 μg l chromium breakthrough with 7 resins varied by as much as a factor of 2 and correlated r2 0 84 with resin total exchange capacities spent brine reuse segmented regeneration an optimized brine reuse method ferrous reduction and nanofiltration of spent brine were estimated to decrease o m costs by 30 70 63 and 61 respectively selection of high performing resins was the most simple way to decrease o m costs up to 70 savings the sum of nitrate and sulfate raw water equivalent concentrations was found to be the principal water quality parameter that influenced the performance of 4 resins in 7 different groundwaters because nitrate and sulfate concentrations were orders of magnitude greater than chromium concentrations resins with higher chromium capacities eluted more co contaminants including arsenic selenium uranium and vanadium because they likely had higher co contaminant capacities co contaminant elution was found to be complex because associations can form between regenerant and co eluting anions sodium chloride was the most efficient regenerant though other regenerants provided benefits such as enhanced uranium elution most likely by complexing with uranium to inhibit its precipitation nitrate peaking was found to be limited even when reusing untreated and nanofiltration treated spent brine keywords brine treatment brine reuse nitrate chromatographic peaking ferrous reduction stannous reduction nanofiltration 1 introduction hexavalent chromium cr vi can enter groundwater from anthropogenic sources and occur naturally gonzalez et al 2005 mckinley et al 1992 recent cr vi toxicological investigations prompted us regulatory agencies to consider lowering the cr vi maximum contaminant level mcl in drinking water which would require many groundwater supplies to implement treatment at considerable costs for example if a cr vi mcl of 10 μg l is promulgated which was implemented in california in 2014 rescinded in 2017 and is currently pending reissuance annual costs could range from 0 3 0 5 billion usd year and 0 5 5 1 billion usd year in california and at the national level respectively seidel et al 2013 thus there is a need to treat cr vi more cost efficiently strong base anion exchange sba ix weak base anion exchange wba ix reduction coagulation filtration rcf and reverse osmosis ro are viable technologies that can decrease cr vi to low levels 5 μg l which may be required to comply with future mcls emerging technologies might also be available in the near future such as stannous reduction of cr vi to trivalent chromium cr iii brandhuber et al 2004 which could be inexpensive to implement because a chemical feed system may be the only required infrastructure although ro is a proven technology that can remove inorganic contaminants like cr vi it generally has a low water recovery 85 and disposing of its reject stream can be costly wba ix has been demonstrated to be effective when raw water ph and or alkalinity are low mcguire et al 2008 but many groundwaters require significant ph adjustment ph adjustment alone was estimated to cost 150 300 usd acre ft 0 122 0 244 usd m3 in several california groundwaters gorman et al 2016 rcf with ferrous chloride can reduce and precipitate cr vi and is an effective option in many cases unless space constraints and sewer access for backwash residuals are a concern recent findings showed that cr vi reduction can occur in as few as 2 min and with a smaller ferrous dose than originally thought which could drastically decrease system footprint as well as capital and o m costs gorman et al in prep when treating groundwater sba ix has largely been implemented to remove nitrate arsenic and perchlorate it can exhibit a greater capacity for cr vi than these contaminants najm et al 2014 which suggests it could more affordably treat cr vi sba ix resins are composed of quaternary amine exchange sites that remain positively charged at high ph ranges which obviates the need for ph adjustment because cr vi anions which are predominately chromate have a greater affinity for quaternary ammines than regenerant anions sba ix can efficiently remove cr vi the most common regenerants are chloride sulfate and bicarbonate each has unique benefits li et al 2016 ness and boyer 2017 but their ability to elute chromate competing anions and co contaminants e g arsenic selenium uranium and vanadium has not been compared altogether also because competing anions e g sulfate nitrate exhaust exchange capacities frequent regeneration can be needed to restore resins to their chloride sulfate or bicarbonate form which typically produces hazardous brine due to accumulated chromium while sba ix capital costs for cr vi treatment may be lower than was originally thought because of advancements in empty bed contact time ebct optimization gorman et al 2016 najm et al 2014 o m costs can be considerable if the spent brine is disposed of as hazardous waste thus brine reuse techniques that decrease hazardous brine generation and treatment technologies that render spent brine nonhazardous while generating small amounts of hazardous waste residuals are actively being researched to optimize o m costs direct brine reuse i e recycling spent brine to regenerate sba ix resin was found to be successful with respect to chromium breakthrough after eight rounds of loading and regeneration when sba ix treated cr vi seidel et al 2014 however others observed a decrease in resin capacity in as little as two rounds of direct brine reuse najm et al 2017 which could have been caused by sulfate accumulation as the raw water sulfate concentrations were high 170 mg l the extent to which competing anions such as sulfate elute during brine reuse needs to be further studied also the ability of co contaminants to be eluted that could potentially foul resins when regenerating with used brine as well as fresh brine has seldom been explored korak et al 2017 innovative reuse techniques have been recently deployed at full scale that reuse the majority of spent brine except for a small proportion of cr vi laden brine while reuse techniques can provide substantial cost savings potential unintended consequences could arise for instance nitrate chromatographic peaking nitrate peaking can occur when reloading sba ix resins after fresh brine regeneration clifford 1999 kim and benjamin 2004 but the effect of reusing spent brine on nitrate peaking needs to be determined cr vi reduction in spent brine with ferrous and sulfur based reductants has been demonstrated at bench and full scale homan et al 2018 siegel and clifford 1988 it is possible other chemical reductants such as stannous could be more efficient nascent technologies for spent brine treatment have been shown to effectively remove cr vi from different matrices for instance nanofiltration nf can remove chromate from low ionic strength waters brandhuber et al 2004 pugazhenthi et al 2005 however if nf can efficiently remove chromate from spent sba ix brine which possesses a high ionic strength that could suppress the ability of the negative surface charge on nf membranes to reject anions is uncertain while brine management methods could decrease sba ix o m costs their performance and costs need to be compared regular advancements in the cr vi removal efficacy of commercially available sba ix resins could also decrease spent brine generation and o m costs especially if these resins are regenerable the regenerability of many new efficient resins still needs to be examined in addition water quality can significantly impact performance however the influence of resin type and water quality and their interaction on costs remains unknown the primary objective of this study is to compare the ability of established and innovative spent brine treatment technologies and reuse techniques as well as high performing resins to decrease sba ix o m costs when treating cr vi to 10 μg l this objective is achieved by conducting conceptual cost analyses based on bench pilot and full scale data that evaluated i the influence of resin type on cr vi removal and regeneration efficiency ii the feasibility of direct brine reuse nf treated brine reuse and segmented regeneration and iii the performance of different chemical reductants and nf to render spent brine nonhazardous additional objectives are to assess the influence of water quality on cr vi removal and o m costs with different resins the scalability of sba ix regeneration the impact of sulfate and bicarbonate based regenerants on regeneration efficiency the elution behavior of co contaminants and the effect of fresh brine untreated spent brine and nf treated spent brine regeneration on nitrate peaking 2 materials and methods 2 1 full scale system monitoring full scale sba ix loading conventional regeneration defined here as co current regeneration using 3 bed volumes bv of conventional brine composed of softened groundwater with 2 m sodium chloride followed by a rinse with 2 bvs of softened groundwater and a segmented regeneration demonstration described below in section 3 4 4 were monitored in a sba ix vessel the full scale 4 ft diameter vessel was loaded with purolite a600e 9149 resin produced in 2016 purolite 2016 had an ebct of 2 4 min a hydraulic loading rate of 12 9 gpm ft2 522 lpm m2 and treated groundwater from a california well containing cr vi the well capacity was 650 gpm 171 lpm had a 38 utilization and produced 393 acre ft 485 000 m3 of treated water annually approximately 0 3 acre ft 370 m3 of spent brine 0 08 of produced treated water was generated annually which is a combination of used conventional brine and rinse water spent brine and historical raw water characteristics are provided in table 1 and s 1 respectively spent brine was hazardous because the 34 1 mg l total chromium tot cr concentration was greater than the 5 mg l stlc 2 2 pilot scale testing two inch diameter pilot columns 2in containing purolite 2016 lanxess sybron xrea 783 lanxess 783 and calgon calres 2117 calgon resins treated the groundwater at the full scale system site after pre filtration through a purenex 5 μm polypropylen cartridge filter brooklyn ny additional loading experiments were conducted using the 2in columns containing lanxess sybron gw66 lanxess 66 dowex pwa15 dowex resintech sbg1 resintech and purolite a600e 9149 resin produced in 2014 purolite 2014 with seven different groundwaters resin characteristics provided by manufacturers are shown in table s 2 hydraulic loading rates and ebcts were targeted at 15 gpm ft2 608 lpm ft2 and 135 s respectively these columns were equipped with flow control flow isolation pressure monitoring and flow totalizers regeneration of the purolite 2016 lanxess 783 and calgon resins in the 2in columns was performed using conventional brine after chromium concentrations had broken through at 10 μg l regeneration was also conducted with 1 1 m sodium bicarbonate and 0 99 m sodium sulfate with purolite 2016 with 2in columns that had been loaded until chromium concentrations had broken through to 10 μg l 2 3 brine treatment bench scale tests treated spent brine collected from the full scale sba ix system chemical precipitation experiments were performed with 50 stannous chloride stannous solution from guard products oakland ca 28 32 ferrous chloride ferrous solution from kemira fontana ca sodium bisulfite bisulfite from fisher scientific hampton nh and calcium polysulfide polysulfide from envirogen kingwood tx reductants were dosed into square jars containing 1 l of spent brine and mixed with a phipps bird jar test apparatus richmond va at 200 rpm for 2 min and at 100 rpm for 10 min which was followed by 1 h of settling without mixing prior to sample collection nf tests treated 14 l of brine using sterlitech tangential flow sepa membrane cells kent wa containing nf5 model nf membranes from applied membranes vista ca at a constant driving pressure of 250 psi 1723 kpa bench tests were terminated when flux rates decreased by 3 2 4 analytical methods tot cr was monitored as a surrogate for cr vi in most tests as historical raw water quality at the full scale system site indicated tot cr is predominately cr vi table s 1 tot cr and other metals were analyzed via icp ms as detailed in supplementary data sd in a subset of chemical reduction experiments cr vi was measured by eurofins eaton analytical monrovia ca nitrate and sulfate were analyzed by flow injection analysis nitrate samples were preserved and analyzed according to epa method 353 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 sba ix loading relationships between the sum of nitrate and sulfate raw water equivalent concentrations and throughput to 8 μg l breakthrough with different sba ix resins in 2in columns are provided in fig 1 a an 8 μg l threshold was selected because this is what sba ix systems would potentially target to satisfy a 10 μg l mcl fig 1a shows for a given resin tot cr breakthrough in different waters relies on the sum of sulfate and nitrate concentrations but different relationships arise for resins with different cr vi capacities previous studies also showed that the principal water quality parameter governing cr vi breakthrough is the summation of nitrate and sulfate equivalent concentrations but with only one or two resins with nearly the same cr vi capacities gorman et al 2016 najm et al 2014 this phenomenon likely occurs because nitrate and sulfate concentrations were several orders of mangitude greater than tot cr concentrations that varied between 13 and 22 μg l which enabled these competing anions to exhaust the majority of exchange sites it is possible that tot cr breakthrough may also rely on tot cr concentrations in groundwaters with significantly greater tot cr levels that would enable tot cr to outcompete sulfate and nitrate ions for more exchange sites because tot cr concentrations are 20 μg l in the groundwater at most systems in the us that would be impacted by a low level cr vi mcl seidel and corwin 2013 these results suggest that the sum of sulfate and nitrate concentrations could be the principal water quality parameter governing sba ix performance where sba ix may be implemented in the future fig 1 shows that resin type can significantly impact performance and the relative order in performance between the resins remains the same regardless of the water for example purolite 2014 resin exhibited 2 times greater bvs to breakthrough compared to the lanxess 66 resin in each water in general resin performance as indicated by throughput to 8 μg l breakthrough increases as total exchange capacity also increases figure s 1 although other resin properties can be important e g particle size porosity total exchange capacity appears to be a good indicator of resin performance the tot cr capacity of the purolite 2014 resin is 2 times the purolite 2016 resin even though they are the same resin model fig 1 these results show that purolite 2016 had a lower tot cr removal capacity than purolite 2014 under similar testing conditions in the same water tested at different times performance variability with the same resin type can substantially impact costs as discussed below in section 3 5 3 3 2 regeneration 3 2 1 full scale full scale conventional regeneration profiles i e conductivity chromium nitrate sulfate and chloride plots after three six and nine loading regeneration cycles are provided in fig 2 when sodium chloride was added loaded anions eluted in the same order and around the same number of bvs as korak et al 2017 found when also using a 2 m sodium chloride brine in pilot columns thus elution profiles could be similar when using conventional brine at other locations complete or near complete anion elution appears to be achieved as anion concentrations are low at the end of brine addition relative to their respective peak elution concentrations which suggests that regeneration with respect to these anions was successful because regeneration profiles are similar for the 9 regeneration cycles fig 2 the purolite 2016 resin appears to be regenerable which is consistent with the manufacturer s classification also the regeneration appears to be complete because chloride associated with all the sites it can exchange with as the chloride concentration increased slowly through the regeneration process until it ultimately approaches a value equal to that of the fresh brine fig 2a c co contaminant elution profiles including arsenic selenium vanadium and uranium are also shown in fig 2 korak et al 2017 which is the only other study to our knowledge that has examined the elution of these co contaminants but at the pilot scale proposed that when uranium enters solution upon exchanging with chloride during regeneration it precipitates back onto sba ix resins unless bicarbonate and or sulfate co elute to form soluble complexes with uranium clifford and zhang 1995 streat and naden 1987 uranium precipitation is undesirable because it would decrease the number of exchange sites and require more frequent regeneration in addition sba ix resins could be classified as technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive materials if a significant amount of uranium accumulation occurs which impacts resin disposal costs and permitting although incomplete uranium elution likely occurred here see section 3 2 3 a sufficient amount was eluted over the nine loading regeneration cycles to maintain cr vi removal capacity as its performance did not significantly decrease in the full scale system data not shown the uranium elution curves shown in fig 2d f exhibit tailing i e concentrations decreased asymptotically tailing was not anticipated because when it occurred most of the sulfate appeared to be eluted and most of the bicarbonate was likely eluted as korak et al 2017 showed sulfate and bicarbonate co elute moreover uranium tailing was not observed in korak et al 2017 the uranium elution curve after the first loading cycle in the pilot column exhibits minimal tailing fig 3 which is consistent with korak et al 2017 thus the uranium tailing may have been caused in the full scale system by uranium accumulation on the resin during the three and subsequent loading regeneration cycles however this does not explain why accumulated uranium does not precipitate back onto resin after most of the sulfate and bicarbonate have been eluted one possible reason uranium tailing occurred is bicarbonate as indicated by alkalinity concentrations are 7 times greater in the softened groundwater used here to make the conventional brine than that used in korak et al 2017 table s 1 thus background bicarbonate in the brine could have enhanced uranium elution in addition at the end of brine addition significant levels of sulfate were still observed 500 mg l even though it appeared that most of the sulfate had been eluted it is possible that such sulfate tailing enabled uranium tailing because uranium was able to elute off of the resin for over 2 bvs of regeneration while it was tailing here whereas korak et al 2017 did not observe tailing and uranium only eluted for 1 bv the presence of sulfate and bicarbonate in regenerate water or sulfate tailing could enable additional uranium elution 3 2 2 regeneration of different resins the regenerability of lanxess 783 and calgon resins was studied in 2in columns a modified conventional regeneration was performed using 3 5 to 4 5 bvs of conventional brine followed by a 2 bv soft water rinse additional conventional brine was used because more tot cr needed to be eluted from the calgon and lanxess 783 resins than the purolite 2016 resin as they exhibited greater tot cr uptake fig 1 regeneration profiles collected with the 2in and full scale systems containing purolite 2016 resin are plotted together in figure s 2 the 2in and full scale regeneration profiles are similar which suggests sba ix regeneration is scalable purolite 2016 calgon and lanxess 783 regeneration profiles are presented in fig 3 the calgon and lanxess 783 resins exhibited greater tot cr peaks and broader elution curves because they have larger tot cr loading capacities the tot cr loaded and subsequently eluted during regeneration with each resin is compared in table 2 only 76 of the tot cr loaded was eluted for the calgon resin whereas the purolite 2016 and lanxess 783 resins achieved complete tot cr elution using 3 5 and 4 5 bvs of conventional brine respectively since calgon resin exhibited a similar tot cr capacity as lanxess 783 resin using 3 5 bvs of conventional brine may have been insufficient as tot cr was still eluting at the end of the brine addition complete elution may be possible with additional brine also both nitrate and sulfate concentrations were near zero and chloride uptake appeared complete toward the end of the brine addition step when regenerating the calgon and lanxess 783 resin which suggests that these resins with greater tot cr capacity are regenerable but may require extended regenerations also resins that remove more tot cr generally elute more co contaminants fig 3 these results demonstrate that high performing resins for tot cr treatment may produce brine with high concentrations of co contaminants and exceed hazardous waste classification levels which could pose a challenge for brine treatment as discussed in section 3 3 3 2 3 alternative regenerants regenerations conducted with 10 bvs of 1 1 m sodium bicarbonate brine and 6 bvs of 0 99 m sodium sulfate brine in 2in columns containing purolite 2016 are profiled in figure s 3 it should be noted that the resin that underwent sodium bicarbonate regeneration was in chloride form during loading and the resin that underwent sodium sulfate regeneration was in sulfate form during loading chloride and sulfate form purolite 2016 resin showed comparable tot cr capacities figure s 4 compared to sodium chloride regeneration similar tot cr elution was achieved with bicarbonate and sulfate regenerants and a comparable amount of sulfate was eluted when using bicarbonate these results suggest that bicarbonate and sulfate regenerants can successfully regenerate sba ix resin which is consistent with li et al 2016 as they showed that sodium chloride and bicarbonate regenerants were equally effective after a regeneration loading cycle both sodium bicarbonate and sodium sulfate regenerants eluted more uranium than sodium chloride regenerant in the 2in columns figure s 3 and table s 3 as discussed in section 3 2 1 both bicarbonate and sulfate form soluble complexes with uranium that prevent its precipitation and enables it to elute since bicarbonate and sodium chloride were used to regenerate columns loaded in parallel a similar amount of uranium likely loaded each column therefore a significant portion of uranium possibly precipitated onto the column regenerated with sodium chloride as 3 times as much uranium eluted when using sodium bicarbonate thus an additional benefit of using these alternative regenerants is additional uranium elution regeneration profiles with sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate figure s 3 show that depressions in vanadium elution occur at the peak of sulfate elution korak et al 2017 also found that a double peak emerges during vanadium elution and attributed this to sulfate co eluting and hindering vanadium elution by forming a sulfate vanadium complex that exhibits greater affinity for the sba ix resin thus it was expected that a sulfate based regenerant may not elute vanadium the sodium sulfate regenerant does not appear to suppress vanadium elution relative to the other regenerants figure s 3 table s 3 even though vanadium sulfate complexes likely formed one reason vanadium sulfate complexes eluted in the presence of sodium sulfate regenerant could be because sulfate has a higher selectivity for sba ix resin compared to the other regenerants that enables sulfate to outcompete sodium vanadium complexes for exchange sites these alternative regenerants may be advantageous to use if there is concern over increased chloride concentrations in finished water or the need to dispose of high strength chloride brine is problematic however greater bvs of sodium sulfate and sodium bicarbonate are required to elute tot cr which produce greater volumes of hazardous spent brine that would incur appreciable o m costs thus in most instances sodium chloride regenerant would likely be preferred 3 3 brine treatment brine treatment with chemical reduction and nf was evaluated at bench scale by treating spent conventional brine collected from the full scale system which provided data to evaluate brine treatment costs in section 3 5 rendering spent brine nonhazardous according to the california stlc for hazardous waste table 1 is the treatment target because a low level cr vi mcl would most likely be reestablished in california the spent brine tot cr concentration is significantly greater than the tot cr stlc table 1 which would be the case for most sba ix systems used for cr vi treatment in addition selenium is present at a concentration that approaches its stlc table 1 indicating that co contaminants could exceed stlcs in spent brine generated at well sites with higher co contaminant concentrations 3 3 1 chemical reduction and precipitation chemical reductants can treat cr vi laden waters by reducing cr vi to cr iii and precipitating cr iii hydroxides polysulfide has treated sba ix spent brine in bench scale experiments and showed optimal performance between ph 8 to 10 3 pakzadeh and batista 2011 it is currently employed at full scale sba ix systems in california bisulfite has treated chromium plating facility wastewater and requires ph adjustments to facilitate tot cr precipitation cushnie 2009 ph was not adjusted in chemical reduction experiments conducted here because it would increase costs ferrous treatment has not required ph adjustment and it has been shown to be effective at bench and full scales homan et al 2018 siegel and clifford 1988 stannous chloride has been used to reduce cr vi in drinking water and did not require ph adjustment brandhuber et al 2004 lai and mcneill 2006 it should be noted that ph adjustment could be required with ferrous and stannous in low alkalinity water spent brine is high in alkalinity because bicarbonate accumulates on sba ix resin korak et al 2017 chemical reduction and precipitation was conducted in jar tests with cr vi laden brine ferrous polysulfide bisulfite and stannous stoichiometric equations modified from clifford et al 1986 wazne et al 2007 trunfio and crini 2010 and brandhuber et al 2004 respectively are provided below 1 c r o 4 2 3 f e c l 2 4 h 2 o 4 o h c r o h 3 s 3 f e o h 3 s 6 c l 2 2 c r o 4 2 3 c a s 5 10 h 2 c r o h 3 s 15 s s 3 c a 2 2 h 2 o 3 2 c r o 4 2 3 na h s o 3 h 2 o

doses should bracket stoichiometric reductant doses plotted against cr vi concentrations are provided in fig 4 complete cr vi reduction was achieved using doses between 2 and 2 5 times stannous ferrous and polysulfide stoichiometric doses at these doses stannous and ferrous achieved 95 tot cr removal resulting in tot cr concentrations below the tot cr stlc polysulfide achieved 50 tot cr removal using 4 5 times its stoichiometric dose bisulfite achieved 50 cr vi reduction and no tot cr removal at the highest dose tested these results are consistent with siegel and clifford 1988 who identified ferrous as the more effective cr vi reductant relative to acidic sulfite stoichiometric reductant doses greater than 1 were needed because there are several oxidants such as oxygen that compete with cr vi to oxidize these reductants homan et al 2018 lai and mcneill 2006 reactions with competing oxidants can be complex for example homan et al 2018 showed that the presence of bicarbonate decreased cr vi reduction by ferrous and proposed that bicarbonate does not oxidize ferrous but complexes with ferrous to facilitate the ferrous oxygen reaction 3 3 2 nf permeate concentrations after treatment with bench scale nf systems are shown in table 3 at nearly 70 recovery nf treatment resulted in tot cr below its stlc despite the high ionic strength of the brine that suppresses electrostatic repulsion nf was still able to remove tot cr efficiently as nearly 80 of the tot cr was rejected at a 70 recovery thus it appears that nf predominately relies on steric rejection these results are in agreement with pérez gonzález et al 2015 who studied the influence of ionic strength on sulfate rejection which has similar physical properties as chromate e g charge mass and hydrated radius they found that sulfate rejection only decreased from 95 to 75 when increasing the ionic strength from 0 4 to 1 2 m table 3 shows that several co contaminants were efficiently removed by nf while this could be beneficial by decreasing the permeate concentration of co contaminants to lower levels at the same time it also increases their concentration in the permeate by observing contaminant concentrations in the retentate table 3 it can be seen that both tot cr and selenium exceed their respective stlcs which shows that if the nf retentate were to be treated to render it nonhazardous a treatment technique would need to remove both contaminants 3 4 brine reuse reusing brine minimizes the generation of hazardous waste which decrease hazardous waste disposal and salt brine consumption costs brine reuse techniques were evaluated which provided data to evaluate cost savings associated with brine reuse in section 3 5 3 4 1 direct brine reuse two rounds of direct brine reuse were conducted by i regenerating an exhausted 4in column containing purolite 2016 resin with fresh brine ii collecting and reusing the spent brine to regenerate the 4in column after it had been reloaded and exhausted round 1 and iii reusing the spent brine from round 1 to regenerate the column after it had been reloaded and exhausted again round 2 prior to reusing spent brine its conductivity was adjusted with nacl to match that of fresh brine fresh and direct brine reuse regenerations were conducted using an extended conventional regeneration comprised of 4 bvs of fresh or spent brine and 2 bvs of soft water round 1 and 2 direct brine reuse and fresh brine regeneration profiles are provided in fig 5 round 1 resulted in a peak tot cr elution of 360 mg l which is more than twice that of fresh brine regeneration tot cr concentrations were nearly zero toward the end of brine addition which suggests tot cr was completely eluted round 2 yielded roughly the same peak tot cr elution as the fresh brine regeneration however a tot cr floor was observed as the tot cr concentration was 40 mg l at the end of brine addition suggesting that tot cr was not completely eluted nearly complete nitrate elution occurred during fresh bine regeneration and incomplete nitrate elution occurred during round 1 and 2 direct brine reuse selenium uranium and vanadium also appear to exhibit floors until the end of the third round brine addition indicating incomplete elution that could decrease the resin s capacity for cr vi uranium in the spent brine would not be expected to precipitate onto the sba ix as soluble uranium is likely already associated with bicarbonate and sulfate present in the brine these results show that for this groundwater regeneration may not be successful beyond one round of direct brine reuse 3 4 2 nf treated brine reuse because bench scale nf treatment of spent brine was effective see section 3 3 2 spent brine was treated in a pilot scale nf system and reused to regenerate 4in columns the effective pore size of nf membranes is between 1 and 10 nm which enables large anions e g chromate sulfate to be rejected while letting small monovalent ions e g chloride permeate crittenden et al 2012 therefore nf treated brine reuse could recover waste brine salts and be conducted over more cycles than direct brine reuse by minimizing tot cr and competing anion accumulation nf treated brine reuse was performed in an analogous way to direct brine reuse except brine was treated by nf before its reuse a 67 recovery was used during pilot nf treatment as bench tests determined this to be the maximum recovery that removed tot cr below its stlc the untreated and permeate concentrations of tot cr co contaminants and major competing anions after nf treatment are provided in table s 4 it should be noted that spent brine treated by nf is both a combination of the 2m nacl brine and rinse water round 1 2 and 3 nf treated brine reuse regeneration profiles are provided in fig 6 tot cr elution peaks varied between 150 and 220 mg l which are similar to that found during fresh brine regeneration in addition elevated chromium and sulfate floors did not arise due to consistent elution curves over multiple rounds of regeneration minimal sulfate and tot cr accumulation and what appears to be complete chloride exchange as its concentration stays nearly constant during the last 2 5 bvs of brine addition nf treated brine reuse appears to be successful for three rounds however a vanadium floor begins to emerge with successive rounds of reusing nf treated brine which likely occurs because nf did not completely remove vanadium thus with additional rounds of nf treated brine reuse vanadium could accumulate and impact sba ix performance uranium tailing was not observed even after three rounds of nf treated brine reuse this could be a result of nf removing most sulfate and bicarbonate from the brine as nf has been shown to remove bicarbonate from solution as efficiently as it removes sulfate which was almost completely removed here table s 4 wu et al 2009 3 4 3 nitrate peaking nitrate peaking during sba ix loading occurs when pre loaded nitrate is exchanged with a more preferred anion which causes nitrate to elute at levels exceeding raw water concentrations to determine the impact of brine reuse on nitrate peaking nitrate was monitored for 1000 bv because previous studies observed nitrate peaking near 1000 bvs mcguire et al 2006 nitrate peaking after fresh brine regeneration direct brine reuse and nf treated brine reuse is 2 5 3 5 times the raw water concentration fig 7 which is consistent with previous research mcguire et al 2006 the magnitude of the nitrate peaks after regeneration with untreated and nf treated spent brine was not significantly greater than the nitrate peaks after regeneration with fresh brine despite untreated and nf treated spent brine regeneration profiles showing nitrate concentrations 250 and 50 mg l as n at the end of brine addition respectively fig 5 and fig 6 these results suggest that direct and nf treated brine reuse may not significantly exacerbate nitrate peaking loading cycles following direct brine and nf treated brine reuse showed that peaking occurred earlier during loading this phenomenon could be a result of incomplete nitrate regeneration that causes nitrate to accumulate deeper in the sba ix bed and elute earlier during subsequent loading cycles the nitrate peaking curve after mixed bed regeneration i e mixing resin after exhaustion and prior to regeneration see sd and figure s 5 resulted in a prolonged smaller peak that was still above the mcl of 10 mg l as n such prolonged elution possibly occurred because the portion of the resin that was at the bottom of the column prior to mixing may have had more remaining nitrate exchange capacity relative to the rest of the resin when this portion of the resin was redistributed throughout the resin bed after mixing it may have attenuated nitrate peaking depending on the raw water nitrate concentration these results show mixed bed regeneration could enable nitrate concentrations to remain below the mcl that would not occur if unmixed regeneration was performed however a prolonged mcl violation could potentially arise if raw water nitrate concentrations were higher 3 4 4 ionexsg segmented regeneration the majority of tot cr can be eluted in a small portion of the total regenerant volume as shown in fig 8 and elsewhere seidel et al 2014 waite 2015 in addition a 2 stage regeneration process can elute a significant portion of the competing anion sulfate by exposing exhausted resin to a low concentration brine e g 0 2 m nacl which can be returned to the plant headworks followed by conventional brine korak et al 2017 ionexsg developed a proprietary segmented regeneration summarized in fig 8 that i uses a low strength brine to selectively elute sulfate that is returned to the plant headworks sulfate return discards the chromium laden high strength brine waste reuses recovered high strength brine containing little sulfate or chromate recovered brine and reuses the rinse fraction rinse to make low strength sulfate return brine and high strength brine fig 8 waite 2015 this approach has decreased spent brine volume requiring disposal by 80 in several full scale sba ix systems implemented in california the regeneration profile from a segmented regeneration demonstration conducted at full scale shows that 1 5 bvs of waste brine was produced including spent rinse water which corresponds to a 70 decrease in the amount of brine requiring disposal relative to that produced during conventional regeneration 3 5 brine treatment and reuse costs brine treatment and reuse cost assessments are compared with baseline i e no brine treatment or reuse costs they include o m and add on capital costs associated with brine treatment and disposal and do not represent the entire sba ix treatment process or costs for additional housing structure if needed electricity brine salts brine treatment chemicals media replacement and residuals disposal associated with brine treatment constitute o m costs capital costs were determined at a class 4 estimate level of accuracy as defined by the association for the advancement of cost engineering aace international such cost estimates are appropriate for feasibility study evaluations and are based on process block diagrams and preliminary equipment costs and use an installed capital cost multiplier of 3 1 costs were analyzed for the sba ix system located in california where pilot and full scale data was collected cost calculations assumed resin requires regeneration every 6500 bv and that 8200 gallons of conventional brine waste is generated per month and the tot cr concentration in brine waste is 34 1 mg l the sd further details the cost assumptions for each brine reuse technique and treatment method 3 5 1 o m costs the contribution of brine salt disposal electricity chemicals used for brine treatment and media costs to overall o m costs are provided in fig 9 a baseline o m costs are 380 usd acre ft 0 308 usd m3 of treated water performing segmented regeneration and one round of direct brine reuse achieved 70 and 30 reductions in o m costs respectively predominantly through minimizing hazardous brine disposal a noticeable costs savings are achieved by decreasing brine salt consumption further cost savings could be achieved with additional direct reuse cycles for instance a 54 reduction in costs would be achieved with 8 direct brine reuse cycles which would be feasible at certain well sites with more favorable water quality as demonstrated in seidel et al 2014 however as shown in fig 10 an asymptote arises in cost savings as reuse cycles increase because i more spent brine is produced than can be reused as it is a composite of previously used brine and rinse water and ii a portion of the spent brine needs to be disposed of prior to its reuse thus a 60 reduction in costs is the maximum that could be achieved with additional direct reuse cycles when 3 bvs of brine and 2 bvs of rinse water are used ferrous and stannous reduction decrease o m costs by 63 and 56 respectively although stannous reduction generates a slightly smaller amount of solid hazardous waste it is more expensive because stannous chloride is 20 times the cost of ferrous chloride decreasing the amount of solid hazardous waste by optimizing the reductant dose and or performing sludge dewatering could improve cost savings the nf disposal and reuse scenarios would achieve a 61 and 67 decrease in o m costs respectively nf disposal costs are relatively large compared to the other brine treatment methods because 33 of the brine is rejected and disposed as hazardous waste thus any improvements in nf recovery could significantly improve cost savings reusing nf treated brine provides a smaller improvement in cost savings compared to direct brine reuse because reusing nf treated brine decreases the volume of non hazardous liquid waste which is 10 times cheaper to dispose compared to hazardous liquid waste fig 10 reusing brine treated with the other technologies would provide similar cost savings though additional treatment may be required further cost savings could be achieved by combining brine treatment technologies and reuse techniques for instance treating brine after one round of direct reuse prior to its disposal with ferrous would decrease costs by 80 or treating nf retentate with ferrous would decrease costs by 85 relative to baseline costs assuming that these matrices would require the same amount of ferrous as spent brine used one time 3 5 2 total costs and non monetary considerations total costs which are the sum of o m and annualized 20 year capital costs that were calculated using an interest rate of 1 2 and amortization factor of 5 7 for all brine treatment methods and reuse techniques are compared in fig 9b for each brine management technique capital costs would make up a minor portion 15 of total annual costs nf treatment which provides a cost savings of 60 could be slightly less expensive relative to ferrous reduction because its capital costs are negligible segmented regeneration is the most inexpensive option and would decrease costs by 66 while direct brine reuse is the least competitive option it still would provide a 28 reduction in costs in addition to monetary considerations other factors could determine which brine management approach is best several of which are compared in table 4 although segmented regeneration has been implemented and permitted at full scale whereas most of the other options have only been examined at bench or pilot scales water utilities could be concerned about its operational complexity which might also be the case for direct brine reuse in addition concerns could arise over reintroducing hazardous spent brine back into sba ix treatment vessels in such instances brine treatment and disposal may be more desirable of the brine treatment technologies assessed nf may be the best option in situations impacted by the criteria in table 4 because it i was found to be slightly cheaper than ferrous reduction ii could be implemented where there are space constraints and operational simplicity is valued and iii was the most effective for treating co contaminants e g selenium which may be required to satisfy hazardous waste regulations in instances where high levels of co contaminant are present in raw water or when more efficient resins are used see section 3 2 2 3 5 3 the influence of resin type resin batch and water quality on costs strong linear relationships r2 0 89 are shown between the sum of nitrate and sulfate concentrations and the sum of disposal and salt costs using four different resins fig 1b these estimates assume that each resin is regenerable which has only been confirmed for purolite 2016 however the results in section 3 2 2 suggested that the two highest performing resins lanxess 783 and calgon could be regenerable fig 1b shows water quality can substantially impact costs for instance there is a 3 fold difference in costs when using lanxess 66 resin if the sum of nitrate and sulfate concentrations is 0 43 versus 1 23 meq l however better performing resins exhibit flatter slopes and costs are less vulnerable to more challenging water qualities and there is a greater benefit of using high performing resins in challenge waters the impact of resin batch variability on cost is also captured in fig 1b as costs would be 1 8 times greater when using purolite 2016 resin compared to purolite 2014 resin because baseline costs shown in fig 9b are only based on disposal and salt costs costs shown in fig 1b where the water quality was the same denoted by solid symbols can be directly compared when using lanxess 783 resin without brine treatment or reuse i e the baseline operation brine disposal and salt costs would be 136 usd acre ft 0 11 usd m3 of treated water which would be as inexpensive as the low cost scenario with the purolite 2016 resin segmented regeneration fig 9b thus the most straightforward method to optimize spent brine management costs when using sba ix is to use the most efficient sba ix resin available although differences in resin costs could potentially reduce cost savings 4 conclusions this study demonstrates that established and emerging brine treatment technologies and reuse techniques can substantially decrease spent brine management o m costs which comprise the majority of sba ix o m costs segmented regeneration which is an optimized brine reuse method that has been implemented at full scale would provide the greatest cost savings but significantly increases operational complexity if brine treatment with disposal is preferred over reuse nf brine treatment would be the most desirable option from an economic and operational standpoint selecting high performing resins was shown to be the most simple way to significantly decrease o m costs moreover better resins provide more cost savings relative to poorer performing resins in waters high in nitrate and or sulfate which could keep costs relatively low in challenge waters the total o m costs of disposing of spent brine as hazardous waste and using the purolite 2016 resin 380 usd acre ft 0 308 usd m3 were estimated to decrease by 66 60 and 65 when employing segmented regeneration nf and the best performing resin lanxess 783 respectively thus it is conceivable that a combination of these cost saving strategies could decrease cost estimates 288 106 usd acre ft 0 233 0 086 usd m3 by over an order of magnitude najm et al 2014 therefore sba ix could meet pending and future cr vi mcls more affordably than previously thought this study also found that pilot scale regeneration can be representative of full scale systems also resin performance largely correlated with total exchange capacities resins with higher tot cr capacities eluted more co contaminants co contaminant elution was found to be complex and may depend on the co elution of different anions and also appears to be impacted by regenerant type acknowledgements we acknowledge analytical and

19584,hexavalent chromium cr vi in drinking water is pending regulation in california and is being considered for regulation in other locations while strong base anion exchange sba ix can efficiently remove cr vi to low levels that may be required to comply with future mcls operational and maintenance o m costs can be considerable if the spent brine is disposed of as hazardous waste through bench and pilot scale experiments and full scale demonstrations this study examined the ability of emerging and established brine treatment and reuse techniques as well as recently developed resins to decrease o m costs when profiling anion elution during regeneration with nanofiltration treated and untreated spent brine it appeared that at least 1 and 3 reuse cycles were feasible respectively stannous and ferrous based reductants were more efficient than sulfur based reductants when treating spent brine bed volumes to 8 μg l chromium breakthrough with 7 resins varied by as much as a factor of 2 and correlated r2 0 84 with resin total exchange capacities spent brine reuse segmented regeneration an optimized brine reuse method ferrous reduction and nanofiltration of spent brine were estimated to decrease o m costs by 30 70 63 and 61 respectively selection of high performing resins was the most simple way to decrease o m costs up to 70 savings the sum of nitrate and sulfate raw water equivalent concentrations was found to be the principal water quality parameter that influenced the performance of 4 resins in 7 different groundwaters because nitrate and sulfate concentrations were orders of magnitude greater than chromium concentrations resins with higher chromium capacities eluted more co contaminants including arsenic selenium uranium and vanadium because they likely had higher co contaminant capacities co contaminant elution was found to be complex because associations can form between regenerant and co eluting anions sodium chloride was the most efficient regenerant though other regenerants provided benefits such as enhanced uranium elution most likely by complexing with uranium to inhibit its precipitation nitrate peaking was found to be limited even when reusing untreated and nanofiltration treated spent brine keywords brine treatment brine reuse nitrate chromatographic peaking ferrous reduction stannous reduction nanofiltration 1 introduction hexavalent chromium cr vi can enter groundwater from anthropogenic sources and occur naturally gonzalez et al 2005 mckinley et al 1992 recent cr vi toxicological investigations prompted us regulatory agencies to consider lowering the cr vi maximum contaminant level mcl in drinking water which would require many groundwater supplies to implement treatment at considerable costs for example if a cr vi mcl of 10 μg l is promulgated which was implemented in california in 2014 rescinded in 2017 and is currently pending reissuance annual costs could range from 0 3 0 5 billion usd year and 0 5 5 1 billion usd year in california and at the national level respectively seidel et al 2013 thus there is a need to treat cr vi more cost efficiently strong base anion exchange sba ix weak base anion exchange wba ix reduction coagulation filtration rcf and reverse osmosis ro are viable technologies that can decrease cr vi to low levels 5 μg l which may be required to comply with future mcls emerging technologies might also be available in the near future such as stannous reduction of cr vi to trivalent chromium cr iii brandhuber et al 2004 which could be inexpensive to implement because a chemical feed system may be the only required infrastructure although ro is a proven technology that can remove inorganic contaminants like cr vi it generally has a low water recovery 85 and disposing of its reject stream can be costly wba ix has been demonstrated to be effective when raw water ph and or alkalinity are low mcguire et al 2008 but many groundwaters require significant ph adjustment ph adjustment alone was estimated to cost 150 300 usd acre ft 0 122 0 244 usd m3 in several california groundwaters gorman et al 2016 rcf with ferrous chloride can reduce and precipitate cr vi and is an effective option in many cases unless space constraints and sewer access for backwash residuals are a concern recent findings showed that cr vi reduction can occur in as few as 2 min and with a smaller ferrous dose than originally thought which could drastically decrease system footprint as well as capital and o m costs gorman et al in prep when treating groundwater sba ix has largely been implemented to remove nitrate arsenic and perchlorate it can exhibit a greater capacity for cr vi than these contaminants najm et al 2014 which suggests it could more affordably treat cr vi sba ix resins are composed of quaternary amine exchange sites that remain positively charged at high ph ranges which obviates the need for ph adjustment because cr vi anions which are predominately chromate have a greater affinity for quaternary ammines than regenerant anions sba ix can efficiently remove cr vi the most common regenerants are chloride sulfate and bicarbonate each has unique benefits li et al 2016 ness and boyer 2017 but their ability to elute chromate competing anions and co contaminants e g arsenic selenium uranium and vanadium has not been compared altogether also because competing anions e g sulfate nitrate exhaust exchange capacities frequent regeneration can be needed to restore resins to their chloride sulfate or bicarbonate form which typically produces hazardous brine due to accumulated chromium while sba ix capital costs for cr vi treatment may be lower than was originally thought because of advancements in empty bed contact time ebct optimization gorman et al 2016 najm et al 2014 o m costs can be considerable if the spent brine is disposed of as hazardous waste thus brine reuse techniques that decrease hazardous brine generation and treatment technologies that render spent brine nonhazardous while generating small amounts of hazardous waste residuals are actively being researched to optimize o m costs direct brine reuse i e recycling spent brine to regenerate sba ix resin was found to be successful with respect to chromium breakthrough after eight rounds of loading and regeneration when sba ix treated cr vi seidel et al 2014 however others observed a decrease in resin capacity in as little as two rounds of direct brine reuse najm et al 2017 which could have been caused by sulfate accumulation as the raw water sulfate concentrations were high 170 mg l the extent to which competing anions such as sulfate elute during brine reuse needs to be further studied also the ability of co contaminants to be eluted that could potentially foul resins when regenerating with used brine as well as fresh brine has seldom been explored korak et al 2017 innovative reuse techniques have been recently deployed at full scale that reuse the majority of spent brine except for a small proportion of cr vi laden brine while reuse techniques can provide substantial cost savings potential unintended consequences could arise for instance nitrate chromatographic peaking nitrate peaking can occur when reloading sba ix resins after fresh brine regeneration clifford 1999 kim and benjamin 2004 but the effect of reusing spent brine on nitrate peaking needs to be determined cr vi reduction in spent brine with ferrous and sulfur based reductants has been demonstrated at bench and full scale homan et al 2018 siegel and clifford 1988 it is possible other chemical reductants such as stannous could be more efficient nascent technologies for spent brine treatment have been shown to effectively remove cr vi from different matrices for instance nanofiltration nf can remove chromate from low ionic strength waters brandhuber et al 2004 pugazhenthi et al 2005 however if nf can efficiently remove chromate from spent sba ix brine which possesses a high ionic strength that could suppress the ability of the negative surface charge on nf membranes to reject anions is uncertain while brine management methods could decrease sba ix o m costs their performance and costs need to be compared regular advancements in the cr vi removal efficacy of commercially available sba ix resins could also decrease spent brine generation and o m costs especially if these resins are regenerable the regenerability of many new efficient resins still needs to be examined in addition water quality can significantly impact performance however the influence of resin type and water quality and their interaction on costs remains unknown the primary objective of this study is to compare the ability of established and innovative spent brine treatment technologies and reuse techniques as well as high performing resins to decrease sba ix o m costs when treating cr vi to 10 μg l this objective is achieved by conducting conceptual cost analyses based on bench pilot and full scale data that evaluated i the influence of resin type on cr vi removal and regeneration efficiency ii the feasibility of direct brine reuse nf treated brine reuse and segmented regeneration and iii the performance of different chemical reductants and nf to render spent brine nonhazardous additional objectives are to assess the influence of water quality on cr vi removal and o m costs with different resins the scalability of sba ix regeneration the impact of sulfate and bicarbonate based regenerants on regeneration efficiency the elution behavior of co contaminants and the effect of fresh brine untreated spent brine and nf treated spent brine regeneration on nitrate peaking 2 materials and methods 2 1 full scale system monitoring full scale sba ix loading conventional regeneration defined here as co current regeneration using 3 bed volumes bv of conventional brine composed of softened groundwater with 2 m sodium chloride followed by a rinse with 2 bvs of softened groundwater and a segmented regeneration demonstration described below in section 3 4 4 were monitored in a sba ix vessel the full scale 4 ft diameter vessel was loaded with purolite a600e 9149 resin produced in 2016 purolite 2016 had an ebct of 2 4 min a hydraulic loading rate of 12 9 gpm ft2 522 lpm m2 and treated groundwater from a california well containing cr vi the well capacity was 650 gpm 171 lpm had a 38 utilization and produced 393 acre ft 485 000 m3 of treated water annually approximately 0 3 acre ft 370 m3 of spent brine 0 08 of produced treated water was generated annually which is a combination of used conventional brine and rinse water spent brine and historical raw water characteristics are provided in table 1 and s 1 respectively spent brine was hazardous because the 34 1 mg l total chromium tot cr concentration was greater than the 5 mg l stlc 2 2 pilot scale testing two inch diameter pilot columns 2in containing purolite 2016 lanxess sybron xrea 783 lanxess 783 and calgon calres 2117 calgon resins treated the groundwater at the full scale system site after pre filtration through a purenex 5 μm polypropylen cartridge filter brooklyn ny additional loading experiments were conducted using the 2in columns containing lanxess sybron gw66 lanxess 66 dowex pwa15 dowex resintech sbg1 resintech and purolite a600e 9149 resin produced in 2014 purolite 2014 with seven different groundwaters resin characteristics provided by manufacturers are shown in table s 2 hydraulic loading rates and ebcts were targeted at 15 gpm ft2 608 lpm ft2 and 135 s respectively these columns were equipped with flow control flow isolation pressure monitoring and flow totalizers regeneration of the purolite 2016 lanxess 783 and calgon resins in the 2in columns was performed using conventional brine after chromium concentrations had broken through at 10 μg l regeneration was also conducted with 1 1 m sodium bicarbonate and 0 99 m sodium sulfate with purolite 2016 with 2in columns that had been loaded until chromium concentrations had broken through to 10 μg l 2 3 brine treatment bench scale tests treated spent brine collected from the full scale sba ix system chemical precipitation experiments were performed with 50 stannous chloride stannous solution from guard products oakland ca 28 32 ferrous chloride ferrous solution from kemira fontana ca sodium bisulfite bisulfite from fisher scientific hampton nh and calcium polysulfide polysulfide from envirogen kingwood tx reductants were dosed into square jars containing 1 l of spent brine and mixed with a phipps bird jar test apparatus richmond va at 200 rpm for 2 min and at 100 rpm for 10 min which was followed by 1 h of settling without mixing prior to sample collection nf tests treated 14 l of brine using sterlitech tangential flow sepa membrane cells kent wa containing nf5 model nf membranes from applied membranes vista ca at a constant driving pressure of 250 psi 1723 kpa bench tests were terminated when flux rates decreased by 3 2 4 analytical methods tot cr was monitored as a surrogate for cr vi in most tests as historical raw water quality at the full scale system site indicated tot cr is predominately cr vi table s 1 tot cr and other metals were analyzed via icp ms as detailed in supplementary data sd in a subset of chemical reduction experiments cr vi was measured by eurofins eaton analytical monrovia ca nitrate and sulfate were analyzed by flow injection analysis nitrate samples were preserved and analyzed according to epa method 353 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 sba ix loading relationships between the sum of nitrate and sulfate raw water equivalent concentrations and throughput to 8 μg l breakthrough with different sba ix resins in 2in columns are provided in fig 1 a an 8 μg l threshold was selected because this is what sba ix systems would potentially target to satisfy a 10 μg l mcl fig 1a shows for a given resin tot cr breakthrough in different waters relies on the sum of sulfate and nitrate concentrations but different relationships arise for resins with different cr vi capacities previous studies also showed that the principal water quality parameter governing cr vi breakthrough is the summation of nitrate and sulfate equivalent concentrations but with only one or two resins with nearly the same cr vi capacities gorman et al 2016 najm et al 2014 this phenomenon likely occurs because nitrate and sulfate concentrations were several orders of mangitude greater than tot cr concentrations that varied between 13 and 22 μg l which enabled these competing anions to exhaust the majority of exchange sites it is possible that tot cr breakthrough may also rely on tot cr concentrations in groundwaters with significantly greater tot cr levels that would enable tot cr to outcompete sulfate and nitrate ions for more exchange sites because tot cr concentrations are 20 μg l in the groundwater at most systems in the us that would be impacted by a low level cr vi mcl seidel and corwin 2013 these results suggest that the sum of sulfate and nitrate concentrations could be the principal water quality parameter governing sba ix performance where sba ix may be implemented in the future fig 1 shows that resin type can significantly impact performance and the relative order in performance between the resins remains the same regardless of the water for example purolite 2014 resin exhibited 2 times greater bvs to breakthrough compared to the lanxess 66 resin in each water in general resin performance as indicated by throughput to 8 μg l breakthrough increases as total exchange capacity also increases figure s 1 although other resin properties can be important e g particle size porosity total exchange capacity appears to be a good indicator of resin performance the tot cr capacity of the purolite 2014 resin is 2 times the purolite 2016 resin even though they are the same resin model fig 1 these results show that purolite 2016 had a lower tot cr removal capacity than purolite 2014 under similar testing conditions in the same water tested at different times performance variability with the same resin type can substantially impact costs as discussed below in section 3 5 3 3 2 regeneration 3 2 1 full scale full scale conventional regeneration profiles i e conductivity chromium nitrate sulfate and chloride plots after three six and nine loading regeneration cycles are provided in fig 2 when sodium chloride was added loaded anions eluted in the same order and around the same number of bvs as korak et al 2017 found when also using a 2 m sodium chloride brine in pilot columns thus elution profiles could be similar when using conventional brine at other locations complete or near complete anion elution appears to be achieved as anion concentrations are low at the end of brine addition relative to their respective peak elution concentrations which suggests that regeneration with respect to these anions was successful because regeneration profiles are similar for the 9 regeneration cycles fig 2 the purolite 2016 resin appears to be regenerable which is consistent with the manufacturer s classification also the regeneration appears to be complete because chloride associated with all the sites it can exchange with as the chloride concentration increased slowly through the regeneration process until it ultimately approaches a value equal to that of the fresh brine fig 2a c co contaminant elution profiles including arsenic selenium vanadium and uranium are also shown in fig 2 korak et al 2017 which is the only other study to our knowledge that has examined the elution of these co contaminants but at the pilot scale proposed that when uranium enters solution upon exchanging with chloride during regeneration it precipitates back onto sba ix resins unless bicarbonate and or sulfate co elute to form soluble complexes with uranium clifford and zhang 1995 streat and naden 1987 uranium precipitation is undesirable because it would decrease the number of exchange sites and require more frequent regeneration in addition sba ix resins could be classified as technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive materials if a significant amount of uranium accumulation occurs which impacts resin disposal costs and permitting although incomplete uranium elution likely occurred here see section 3 2 3 a sufficient amount was eluted over the nine loading regeneration cycles to maintain cr vi removal capacity as its performance did not significantly decrease in the full scale system data not shown the uranium elution curves shown in fig 2d f exhibit tailing i e concentrations decreased asymptotically tailing was not anticipated because when it occurred most of the sulfate appeared to be eluted and most of the bicarbonate was likely eluted as korak et al 2017 showed sulfate and bicarbonate co elute moreover uranium tailing was not observed in korak et al 2017 the uranium elution curve after the first loading cycle in the pilot column exhibits minimal tailing fig 3 which is consistent with korak et al 2017 thus the uranium tailing may have been caused in the full scale system by uranium accumulation on the resin during the three and subsequent loading regeneration cycles however this does not explain why accumulated uranium does not precipitate back onto resin after most of the sulfate and bicarbonate have been eluted one possible reason uranium tailing occurred is bicarbonate as indicated by alkalinity concentrations are 7 times greater in the softened groundwater used here to make the conventional brine than that used in korak et al 2017 table s 1 thus background bicarbonate in the brine could have enhanced uranium elution in addition at the end of brine addition significant levels of sulfate were still observed 500 mg l even though it appeared that most of the sulfate had been eluted it is possible that such sulfate tailing enabled uranium tailing because uranium was able to elute off of the resin for over 2 bvs of regeneration while it was tailing here whereas korak et al 2017 did not observe tailing and uranium only eluted for 1 bv the presence of sulfate and bicarbonate in regenerate water or sulfate tailing could enable additional uranium elution 3 2 2 regeneration of different resins the regenerability of lanxess 783 and calgon resins was studied in 2in columns a modified conventional regeneration was performed using 3 5 to 4 5 bvs of conventional brine followed by a 2 bv soft water rinse additional conventional brine was used because more tot cr needed to be eluted from the calgon and lanxess 783 resins than the purolite 2016 resin as they exhibited greater tot cr uptake fig 1 regeneration profiles collected with the 2in and full scale systems containing purolite 2016 resin are plotted together in figure s 2 the 2in and full scale regeneration profiles are similar which suggests sba ix regeneration is scalable purolite 2016 calgon and lanxess 783 regeneration profiles are presented in fig 3 the calgon and lanxess 783 resins exhibited greater tot cr peaks and broader elution curves because they have larger tot cr loading capacities the tot cr loaded and subsequently eluted during regeneration with each resin is compared in table 2 only 76 of the tot cr loaded was eluted for the calgon resin whereas the purolite 2016 and lanxess 783 resins achieved complete tot cr elution using 3 5 and 4 5 bvs of conventional brine respectively since calgon resin exhibited a similar tot cr capacity as lanxess 783 resin using 3 5 bvs of conventional brine may have been insufficient as tot cr was still eluting at the end of the brine addition complete elution may be possible with additional brine also both nitrate and sulfate concentrations were near zero and chloride uptake appeared complete toward the end of the brine addition step when regenerating the calgon and lanxess 783 resin which suggests that these resins with greater tot cr capacity are regenerable but may require extended regenerations also resins that remove more tot cr generally elute more co contaminants fig 3 these results demonstrate that high performing resins for tot cr treatment may produce brine with high concentrations of co contaminants and exceed hazardous waste classification levels which could pose a challenge for brine treatment as discussed in section 3 3 3 2 3 alternative regenerants regenerations conducted with 10 bvs of 1 1 m sodium bicarbonate brine and 6 bvs of 0 99 m sodium sulfate brine in 2in columns containing purolite 2016 are profiled in figure s 3 it should be noted that the resin that underwent sodium bicarbonate regeneration was in chloride form during loading and the resin that underwent sodium sulfate regeneration was in sulfate form during loading chloride and sulfate form purolite 2016 resin showed comparable tot cr capacities figure s 4 compared to sodium chloride regeneration similar tot cr elution was achieved with bicarbonate and sulfate regenerants and a comparable amount of sulfate was eluted when using bicarbonate these results suggest that bicarbonate and sulfate regenerants can successfully regenerate sba ix resin which is consistent with li et al 2016 as they showed that sodium chloride and bicarbonate regenerants were equally effective after a regeneration loading cycle both sodium bicarbonate and sodium sulfate regenerants eluted more uranium than sodium chloride regenerant in the 2in columns figure s 3 and table s 3 as discussed in section 3 2 1 both bicarbonate and sulfate form soluble complexes with uranium that prevent its precipitation and enables it to elute since bicarbonate and sodium chloride were used to regenerate columns loaded in parallel a similar amount of uranium likely loaded each column therefore a significant portion of uranium possibly precipitated onto the column regenerated with sodium chloride as 3 times as much uranium eluted when using sodium bicarbonate thus an additional benefit of using these alternative regenerants is additional uranium elution regeneration profiles with sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate figure s 3 show that depressions in vanadium elution occur at the peak of sulfate elution korak et al 2017 also found that a double peak emerges during vanadium elution and attributed this to sulfate co eluting and hindering vanadium elution by forming a sulfate vanadium complex that exhibits greater affinity for the sba ix resin thus it was expected that a sulfate based regenerant may not elute vanadium the sodium sulfate regenerant does not appear to suppress vanadium elution relative to the other regenerants figure s 3 table s 3 even though vanadium sulfate complexes likely formed one reason vanadium sulfate complexes eluted in the presence of sodium sulfate regenerant could be because sulfate has a higher selectivity for sba ix resin compared to the other regenerants that enables sulfate to outcompete sodium vanadium complexes for exchange sites these alternative regenerants may be advantageous to use if there is concern over increased chloride concentrations in finished water or the need to dispose of high strength chloride brine is problematic however greater bvs of sodium sulfate and sodium bicarbonate are required to elute tot cr which produce greater volumes of hazardous spent brine that would incur appreciable o m costs thus in most instances sodium chloride regenerant would likely be preferred 3 3 brine treatment brine treatment with chemical reduction and nf was evaluated at bench scale by treating spent conventional brine collected from the full scale system which provided data to evaluate brine treatment costs in section 3 5 rendering spent brine nonhazardous according to the california stlc for hazardous waste table 1 is the treatment target because a low level cr vi mcl would most likely be reestablished in california the spent brine tot cr concentration is significantly greater than the tot cr stlc table 1 which would be the case for most sba ix systems used for cr vi treatment in addition selenium is present at a concentration that approaches its stlc table 1 indicating that co contaminants could exceed stlcs in spent brine generated at well sites with higher co contaminant concentrations 3 3 1 chemical reduction and precipitation chemical reductants can treat cr vi laden waters by reducing cr vi to cr iii and precipitating cr iii hydroxides polysulfide has treated sba ix spent brine in bench scale experiments and showed optimal performance between ph 8 to 10 3 pakzadeh and batista 2011 it is currently employed at full scale sba ix systems in california bisulfite has treated chromium plating facility wastewater and requires ph adjustments to facilitate tot cr precipitation cushnie 2009 ph was not adjusted in chemical reduction experiments conducted here because it would increase costs ferrous treatment has not required ph adjustment and it has been shown to be effective at bench and full scales homan et al 2018 siegel and clifford 1988 stannous chloride has been used to reduce cr vi in drinking water and did not require ph adjustment brandhuber et al 2004 lai and mcneill 2006 it should be noted that ph adjustment could be required with ferrous and stannous in low alkalinity water spent brine is high in alkalinity because bicarbonate accumulates on sba ix resin korak et al 2017 chemical reduction and precipitation was conducted in jar tests with cr vi laden brine ferrous polysulfide bisulfite and stannous stoichiometric equations modified from clifford et al 1986 wazne et al 2007 trunfio and crini 2010 and brandhuber et al 2004 respectively are provided below 1 c r o 4 2 3 f e c l 2 4 h 2 o 4 o h c r o h 3 s 3 f e o h 3 s 6 c l 2 2 c r o 4 2 3 c a s 5 10 h 2 c r o h 3 s 15 s s 3 c a 2 2 h 2 o 3 2 c r o 4 2 3 na h s o 3 h 2 o

doses should bracket stoichiometric reductant doses plotted against cr vi concentrations are provided in fig 4 complete cr vi reduction was achieved using doses between 2 and 2 5 times stannous ferrous and polysulfide stoichiometric doses at these doses stannous and ferrous achieved 95 tot cr removal resulting in tot cr concentrations below the tot cr stlc polysulfide achieved 50 tot cr removal using 4 5 times its stoichiometric dose bisulfite achieved 50 cr vi reduction and no tot cr removal at the highest dose tested these results are consistent with siegel and clifford 1988 who identified ferrous as the more effective cr vi reductant relative to acidic sulfite stoichiometric reductant doses greater than 1 were needed because there are several oxidants such as oxygen that compete with cr vi to oxidize these reductants homan et al 2018 lai and mcneill 2006 reactions with competing oxidants can be complex for example homan et al 2018 showed that the presence of bicarbonate decreased cr vi reduction by ferrous and proposed that bicarbonate does not oxidize ferrous but complexes with ferrous to facilitate the ferrous oxygen reaction 3 3 2 nf permeate concentrations after treatment with bench scale nf systems are shown in table 3 at nearly 70 recovery nf treatment resulted in tot cr below its stlc despite the high ionic strength of the brine that suppresses electrostatic repulsion nf was still able to remove tot cr efficiently as nearly 80 of the tot cr was rejected at a 70 recovery thus it appears that nf predominately relies on steric rejection these results are in agreement with pérez gonzález et al 2015 who studied the influence of ionic strength on sulfate rejection which has similar physical properties as chromate e g charge mass and hydrated radius they found that sulfate rejection only decreased from 95 to 75 when increasing the ionic strength from 0 4 to 1 2 m table 3 shows that several co contaminants were efficiently removed by nf while this could be beneficial by decreasing the permeate concentration of co contaminants to lower levels at the same time it also increases their concentration in the permeate by observing contaminant concentrations in the retentate table 3 it can be seen that both tot cr and selenium exceed their respective stlcs which shows that if the nf retentate were to be treated to render it nonhazardous a treatment technique would need to remove both contaminants 3 4 brine reuse reusing brine minimizes the generation of hazardous waste which decrease hazardous waste disposal and salt brine consumption costs brine reuse techniques were evaluated which provided data to evaluate cost savings associated with brine reuse in section 3 5 3 4 1 direct brine reuse two rounds of direct brine reuse were conducted by i regenerating an exhausted 4in column containing purolite 2016 resin with fresh brine ii collecting and reusing the spent brine to regenerate the 4in column after it had been reloaded and exhausted round 1 and iii reusing the spent brine from round 1 to regenerate the column after it had been reloaded and exhausted again round 2 prior to reusing spent brine its conductivity was adjusted with nacl to match that of fresh brine fresh and direct brine reuse regenerations were conducted using an extended conventional regeneration comprised of 4 bvs of fresh or spent brine and 2 bvs of soft water round 1 and 2 direct brine reuse and fresh brine regeneration profiles are provided in fig 5 round 1 resulted in a peak tot cr elution of 360 mg l which is more than twice that of fresh brine regeneration tot cr concentrations were nearly zero toward the end of brine addition which suggests tot cr was completely eluted round 2 yielded roughly the same peak tot cr elution as the fresh brine regeneration however a tot cr floor was observed as the tot cr concentration was 40 mg l at the end of brine addition suggesting that tot cr was not completely eluted nearly complete nitrate elution occurred during fresh bine regeneration and incomplete nitrate elution occurred during round 1 and 2 direct brine reuse selenium uranium and vanadium also appear to exhibit floors until the end of the third round brine addition indicating incomplete elution that could decrease the resin s capacity for cr vi uranium in the spent brine would not be expected to precipitate onto the sba ix as soluble uranium is likely already associated with bicarbonate and sulfate present in the brine these results show that for this groundwater regeneration may not be successful beyond one round of direct brine reuse 3 4 2 nf treated brine reuse because bench scale nf treatment of spent brine was effective see section 3 3 2 spent brine was treated in a pilot scale nf system and reused to regenerate 4in columns the effective pore size of nf membranes is between 1 and 10 nm which enables large anions e g chromate sulfate to be rejected while letting small monovalent ions e g chloride permeate crittenden et al 2012 therefore nf treated brine reuse could recover waste brine salts and be conducted over more cycles than direct brine reuse by minimizing tot cr and competing anion accumulation nf treated brine reuse was performed in an analogous way to direct brine reuse except brine was treated by nf before its reuse a 67 recovery was used during pilot nf treatment as bench tests determined this to be the maximum recovery that removed tot cr below its stlc the untreated and permeate concentrations of tot cr co contaminants and major competing anions after nf treatment are provided in table s 4 it should be noted that spent brine treated by nf is both a combination of the 2m nacl brine and rinse water round 1 2 and 3 nf treated brine reuse regeneration profiles are provided in fig 6 tot cr elution peaks varied between 150 and 220 mg l which are similar to that found during fresh brine regeneration in addition elevated chromium and sulfate floors did not arise due to consistent elution curves over multiple rounds of regeneration minimal sulfate and tot cr accumulation and what appears to be complete chloride exchange as its concentration stays nearly constant during the last 2 5 bvs of brine addition nf treated brine reuse appears to be successful for three rounds however a vanadium floor begins to emerge with successive rounds of reusing nf treated brine which likely occurs because nf did not completely remove vanadium thus with additional rounds of nf treated brine reuse vanadium could accumulate and impact sba ix performance uranium tailing was not observed even after three rounds of nf treated brine reuse this could be a result of nf removing most sulfate and bicarbonate from the brine as nf has been shown to remove bicarbonate from solution as efficiently as it removes sulfate which was almost completely removed here table s 4 wu et al 2009 3 4 3 nitrate peaking nitrate peaking during sba ix loading occurs when pre loaded nitrate is exchanged with a more preferred anion which causes nitrate to elute at levels exceeding raw water concentrations to determine the impact of brine reuse on nitrate peaking nitrate was monitored for 1000 bv because previous studies observed nitrate peaking near 1000 bvs mcguire et al 2006 nitrate peaking after fresh brine regeneration direct brine reuse and nf treated brine reuse is 2 5 3 5 times the raw water concentration fig 7 which is consistent with previous research mcguire et al 2006 the magnitude of the nitrate peaks after regeneration with untreated and nf treated spent brine was not significantly greater than the nitrate peaks after regeneration with fresh brine despite untreated and nf treated spent brine regeneration profiles showing nitrate concentrations 250 and 50 mg l as n at the end of brine addition respectively fig 5 and fig 6 these results suggest that direct and nf treated brine reuse may not significantly exacerbate nitrate peaking loading cycles following direct brine and nf treated brine reuse showed that peaking occurred earlier during loading this phenomenon could be a result of incomplete nitrate regeneration that causes nitrate to accumulate deeper in the sba ix bed and elute earlier during subsequent loading cycles the nitrate peaking curve after mixed bed regeneration i e mixing resin after exhaustion and prior to regeneration see sd and figure s 5 resulted in a prolonged smaller peak that was still above the mcl of 10 mg l as n such prolonged elution possibly occurred because the portion of the resin that was at the bottom of the column prior to mixing may have had more remaining nitrate exchange capacity relative to the rest of the resin when this portion of the resin was redistributed throughout the resin bed after mixing it may have attenuated nitrate peaking depending on the raw water nitrate concentration these results show mixed bed regeneration could enable nitrate concentrations to remain below the mcl that would not occur if unmixed regeneration was performed however a prolonged mcl violation could potentially arise if raw water nitrate concentrations were higher 3 4 4 ionexsg segmented regeneration the majority of tot cr can be eluted in a small portion of the total regenerant volume as shown in fig 8 and elsewhere seidel et al 2014 waite 2015 in addition a 2 stage regeneration process can elute a significant portion of the competing anion sulfate by exposing exhausted resin to a low concentration brine e g 0 2 m nacl which can be returned to the plant headworks followed by conventional brine korak et al 2017 ionexsg developed a proprietary segmented regeneration summarized in fig 8 that i uses a low strength brine to selectively elute sulfate that is returned to the plant headworks sulfate return discards the chromium laden high strength brine waste reuses recovered high strength brine containing little sulfate or chromate recovered brine and reuses the rinse fraction rinse to make low strength sulfate return brine and high strength brine fig 8 waite 2015 this approach has decreased spent brine volume requiring disposal by 80 in several full scale sba ix systems implemented in california the regeneration profile from a segmented regeneration demonstration conducted at full scale shows that 1 5 bvs of waste brine was produced including spent rinse water which corresponds to a 70 decrease in the amount of brine requiring disposal relative to that produced during conventional regeneration 3 5 brine treatment and reuse costs brine treatment and reuse cost assessments are compared with baseline i e no brine treatment or reuse costs they include o m and add on capital costs associated with brine treatment and disposal and do not represent the entire sba ix treatment process or costs for additional housing structure if needed electricity brine salts brine treatment chemicals media replacement and residuals disposal associated with brine treatment constitute o m costs capital costs were determined at a class 4 estimate level of accuracy as defined by the association for the advancement of cost engineering aace international such cost estimates are appropriate for feasibility study evaluations and are based on process block diagrams and preliminary equipment costs and use an installed capital cost multiplier of 3 1 costs were analyzed for the sba ix system located in california where pilot and full scale data was collected cost calculations assumed resin requires regeneration every 6500 bv and that 8200 gallons of conventional brine waste is generated per month and the tot cr concentration in brine waste is 34 1 mg l the sd further details the cost assumptions for each brine reuse technique and treatment method 3 5 1 o m costs the contribution of brine salt disposal electricity chemicals used for brine treatment and media costs to overall o m costs are provided in fig 9 a baseline o m costs are 380 usd acre ft 0 308 usd m3 of treated water performing segmented regeneration and one round of direct brine reuse achieved 70 and 30 reductions in o m costs respectively predominantly through minimizing hazardous brine disposal a noticeable costs savings are achieved by decreasing brine salt consumption further cost savings could be achieved with additional direct reuse cycles for instance a 54 reduction in costs would be achieved with 8 direct brine reuse cycles which would be feasible at certain well sites with more favorable water quality as demonstrated in seidel et al 2014 however as shown in fig 10 an asymptote arises in cost savings as reuse cycles increase because i more spent brine is produced than can be reused as it is a composite of previously used brine and rinse water and ii a portion of the spent brine needs to be disposed of prior to its reuse thus a 60 reduction in costs is the maximum that could be achieved with additional direct reuse cycles when 3 bvs of brine and 2 bvs of rinse water are used ferrous and stannous reduction decrease o m costs by 63 and 56 respectively although stannous reduction generates a slightly smaller amount of solid hazardous waste it is more expensive because stannous chloride is 20 times the cost of ferrous chloride decreasing the amount of solid hazardous waste by optimizing the reductant dose and or performing sludge dewatering could improve cost savings the nf disposal and reuse scenarios would achieve a 61 and 67 decrease in o m costs respectively nf disposal costs are relatively large compared to the other brine treatment methods because 33 of the brine is rejected and disposed as hazardous waste thus any improvements in nf recovery could significantly improve cost savings reusing nf treated brine provides a smaller improvement in cost savings compared to direct brine reuse because reusing nf treated brine decreases the volume of non hazardous liquid waste which is 10 times cheaper to dispose compared to hazardous liquid waste fig 10 reusing brine treated with the other technologies would provide similar cost savings though additional treatment may be required further cost savings could be achieved by combining brine treatment technologies and reuse techniques for instance treating brine after one round of direct reuse prior to its disposal with ferrous would decrease costs by 80 or treating nf retentate with ferrous would decrease costs by 85 relative to baseline costs assuming that these matrices would require the same amount of ferrous as spent brine used one time 3 5 2 total costs and non monetary considerations total costs which are the sum of o m and annualized 20 year capital costs that were calculated using an interest rate of 1 2 and amortization factor of 5 7 for all brine treatment methods and reuse techniques are compared in fig 9b for each brine management technique capital costs would make up a minor portion 15 of total annual costs nf treatment which provides a cost savings of 60 could be slightly less expensive relative to ferrous reduction because its capital costs are negligible segmented regeneration is the most inexpensive option and would decrease costs by 66 while direct brine reuse is the least competitive option it still would provide a 28 reduction in costs in addition to monetary considerations other factors could determine which brine management approach is best several of which are compared in table 4 although segmented regeneration has been implemented and permitted at full scale whereas most of the other options have only been examined at bench or pilot scales water utilities could be concerned about its operational complexity which might also be the case for direct brine reuse in addition concerns could arise over reintroducing hazardous spent brine back into sba ix treatment vessels in such instances brine treatment and disposal may be more desirable of the brine treatment technologies assessed nf may be the best option in situations impacted by the criteria in table 4 because it i was found to be slightly cheaper than ferrous reduction ii could be implemented where there are space constraints and operational simplicity is valued and iii was the most effective for treating co contaminants e g selenium which may be required to satisfy hazardous waste regulations in instances where high levels of co contaminant are present in raw water or when more efficient resins are used see section 3 2 2 3 5 3 the influence of resin type resin batch and water quality on costs strong linear relationships r2 0 89 are shown between the sum of nitrate and sulfate concentrations and the sum of disposal and salt costs using four different resins fig 1b these estimates assume that each resin is regenerable which has only been confirmed for purolite 2016 however the results in section 3 2 2 suggested that the two highest performing resins lanxess 783 and calgon could be regenerable fig 1b shows water quality can substantially impact costs for instance there is a 3 fold difference in costs when using lanxess 66 resin if the sum of nitrate and sulfate concentrations is 0 43 versus 1 23 meq l however better performing resins exhibit flatter slopes and costs are less vulnerable to more challenging water qualities and there is a greater benefit of using high performing resins in challenge waters the impact of resin batch variability on cost is also captured in fig 1b as costs would be 1 8 times greater when using purolite 2016 resin compared to purolite 2014 resin because baseline costs shown in fig 9b are only based on disposal and salt costs costs shown in fig 1b where the water quality was the same denoted by solid symbols can be directly compared when using lanxess 783 resin without brine treatment or reuse i e the baseline operation brine disposal and salt costs would be 136 usd acre ft 0 11 usd m3 of treated water which would be as inexpensive as the low cost scenario with the purolite 2016 resin segmented regeneration fig 9b thus the most straightforward method to optimize spent brine management costs when using sba ix is to use the most efficient sba ix resin available although differences in resin costs could potentially reduce cost savings 4 conclusions this study demonstrates that established and emerging brine treatment technologies and reuse techniques can substantially decrease spent brine management o m costs which comprise the majority of sba ix o m costs segmented regeneration which is an optimized brine reuse method that has been implemented at full scale would provide the greatest cost savings but significantly increases operational complexity if brine treatment with disposal is preferred over reuse nf brine treatment would be the most desirable option from an economic and operational standpoint selecting high performing resins was shown to be the most simple way to significantly decrease o m costs moreover better resins provide more cost savings relative to poorer performing resins in waters high in nitrate and or sulfate which could keep costs relatively low in challenge waters the total o m costs of disposing of spent brine as hazardous waste and using the purolite 2016 resin 380 usd acre ft 0 308 usd m3 were estimated to decrease by 66 60 and 65 when employing segmented regeneration nf and the best performing resin lanxess 783 respectively thus it is conceivable that a combination of these cost saving strategies could decrease cost estimates 288 106 usd acre ft 0 233 0 086 usd m3 by over an order of magnitude najm et al 2014 therefore sba ix could meet pending and future cr vi mcls more affordably than previously thought this study also found that pilot scale regeneration can be representative of full scale systems also resin performance largely correlated with total exchange capacities resins with higher tot cr capacities eluted more co contaminants co contaminant elution was found to be complex and may depend on the co elution of different anions and also appears to be impacted by regenerant type acknowledgements we acknowledge analytical and
