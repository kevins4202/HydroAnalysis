11570,it is known that using paired laterals in which two distribution pipes extend in opposite directions from a common manifold contribute to increasing water use efficiency wue recently an analytical procedure to optimally design paired drip laterals on uniform slopes was proposed more recently this design procedure was simplified by deriving simple explicit relationships as a function of 16 calibration constants with relative errors that were less than 2 in this paper further simple design relationships are derived that require only 3 calibration constants thus more readily obtainable results are produced and the influence of the flow rate and diameter exponents of resistance equation are made more evident simple monomial relationships were also extended for the cases in which the lateral is laid on flat fields on upward fields and also considering layouts in which the manifold is located at the boundary instead of inside of the irrigation unit for the five considered layouts evaluations of the effects of design choices in terms of energy saving and comparisons between optimal lateral lengths are carried out finally simple linear relationships linking lateral pressure head tolerance δ coefficient of variation of pressure heads cv and emission uniformity coefficient of keller and karmeli eu are presented results showed that for any design solutions associated with the considered layouts and for δ 0 1 the proposed procedure allows optimal design of the lateral optimizing wue assuring low values of pressure head variability cv 6 1 and high values

function 1 introduction microirrigation systems saves water by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots plants either onto the soil surface or directly near the root zone through a network of valves pipes tubing and emitters it is done through narrow tubes that deliver water directly to the base of the plant thus they are considered convenient and effective means to supply water directly along individual crop rows and maintain the current levels of crop production as a consequence microirrigation can reduce water requirements and operation costs in respect to other irrigation systems keller and bliesner 1990 a lot of factors influence the diffusion of microirrigation such as the water price the cost of the equipment and the crop price some factors are related to the characteristics of the environment as the precipitation regime agnese et al 2014 and the soil hydrological characteristics which may present high spatial variability even though the same land management is assumed genius et al 2012 baiamonte et al 2017 the initial investment equipment cost which may be higher than that of traditional methods can make farmers unwilling to choose the microirrigation system however in the long term costs can be reduced through a substantial reduction in labor cost water only needs to be regulated which usually can be done via automatically timed devices costs can also be reduced by optimizing water use efficiency wue and energy saving which can be attained when the submain and lateral units are well designed so as to maximize the emitter uniformity wu et al 2010 developed a simple gravity fed drip irrigation system design procedure for low cost single manifold subunits with multiple pressure sections by assuming that the laterals are laid along elevation contours so that the ground slope along the lateral is equal to zero moreover it required iterative calculation process for determining the number of emitters per lateral and the lateral length keshtgar et al 2013 took emitter uniformity to extremes for a drip irrigation system presenting a design procedure based on variable length microtubes as emitters along the laterals thus attaining total emission uniformity however the suggested criterion might be difficult to use in practice in designing drip irrigation laterals with traditional emitters a well accepted practice consists in limiting the variation of the pressure head to about δ of its nominal value along the lateral where the pressure head tolerance δ can be assumed to be around 10 depending on each design and in particular on the accepted flow rate variability of the emitters installed along the laterals this design criterion is also considered in the manufacturers catalogues which usually provide the maximum lateral lengths for fixed nominal emitter pressure heads flow rates emitter spacing and pipe diameters for a manifold that is located at the boundary of the irrigation sector and for flat fields so that the pressure head stays in a certain admitted range of variability however in natural fields differences in elevation are usual in laterals of significant length so that the values suggested in the catalogues that manufacturers provide cannot be used without compromising the water distribution uniformity sometimes in the catalogues a note warns that the suggested lengths are subject to change due to changes in the conditions in which the tests were performed and that the lengths are valid for drip laterals laid in flat fields some companies suggest using pressure compensating emitters pce in order to overcome the effect of the slope on the lateral length of sloping fields and for very long drip laterals where the pressure at the beginning and at the end of the drip line presents considerable differences that would considerably affect the scope of the individual emitters however compared to non pressure compensating emitters such emitters are more expansive more complicated structurally and the working mechanism which causes difficulty in their research and development is not clear chu et al 2015 moreover although in the last decades pce technology was improved in the past showed contraindications madramootoo et al 1987 madramootoo 1988 and are not suggested for low pressure heads perea et al 2013 generally it is agreed that they will not last as long as non pressure compensating emitters because of the life span of the elastomer the design criterion to control pressure heads of traditional non pressure compensating emitters has been widely applied in literature also for sloping laterals it has been considered in many papers describing the basic hydraulics of drip irrigation design karmeli and keller 1975 wu and gitlin 1975 wu et al 1983 baiamonte et al 2015 baiamonte 2016a moreover disposing paired laterals so that two distribution pipes extend in opposite directions from a common manifold contributes to provide more uniform pressure to all laterals in the system increasing water use and energy efficiency of microirrigation and maximizing the lateral length al samarmad 2002 keller and bliesner 1990 stated that the best position of the manifold bmp is achieved when the same minimum pressure head in the uphill and in the downhill lateral occurs and developed graphical and numerical solution methods while previously wu et al 1983 had developed design charts allowing to determine it for horizontal paired laterals the uphill lateral length equals the downhill lateral length bmp 0 5 whereas for any other field slope the manifold has to be shifted uphill so to balance the differences in elevation and pressure losses on both laterals side kang and nishiyama 1996 used the finite element method to analyze the pressure head and discharge distribution along lateral and submain pipe the golden section search gill et al 1989 pinthong et al 2013 was applied to find the operating pressure heads of lateral and the bmp corresponding to the required uniformity of water application more recently according to the aforementioned definition of bmp provided by keller and bliesner 1990 jiang and kang 2010 used the energy gradient line approach wu 1975 wu and gitlin 1975 wu et al 1986 to derive analytical solutions to determine bmp pinthong et al 2013 developed a model to analyze the steady state hydraulics of branching pipe networks as found in on farm pressurized irrigation systems with multiple outlets at sprinklers or emitters the model used a new methodology to identify all flow paths based on a shortest path algorithm it also uses elevation obtained by high resolution topographical data and hydraulic parameters to determine which outlets are flowing and which are not an iterative solution approach resulted in the calculated flow rates and pressures at all nodes in the network with a single source node which can have a fixed head the model is based on a methodology that starts at the downstream end of a branching pipe system and works in the upstream direction to determine flow rates and pressures at each node the forward step by step sbs procedure as well known represents the most affordable method to evaluate the pressure heads and the actual flow rates that correspond to all of the emitters in the lateral however when it is applied from the uphill end to the downhill end of the lateral time consuming iterations and trials are needed to find optimal solutions al amoud 1995 kang et al 1996 kang 2000 the design process of the drip lateral can be simplified with the assumption that local losses can be neglected i e in all of the cases for which variations of flow velocity due to the emitters is limited and the morphology of emitter connections does not produce significant reductions of the lateral cross section this could be the case of flat in line coextruded drippers that are installed parallel to the pipe within the manufacturing process with relatively small profile to minimize flow disorders in the drip lateral for in line emitters characterized by an α fraction of kinetic head flow 0 3 and emitter spacing equal to 1 m local losses less than 10 of the total losses were found by provenzano and pumo 2004 under the blasius resistance equation baiamonte et al 2015 presented an analytical approach to evaluate the optimal length of paired drip laterals placed on uniformly sloped grounds by assuming that i the variations of emitters flow rate along the lateral as well as ii the local losses due to emitters insertions could be neglected although the latter assumption can be accepted only in some cases and can be fully relaxed in the exact sbs procedure which already provide complete and exact solutions the usefulness of analytical solutions is also important to consider they don t need iterations to be coded in computer programs give easy cognition of how the factors affecting the studied feature influence the output variables and serve a useful pedagogical purpose anderson and woessner 1992 giraldez and woolhiser 1996 baiamonte and singh 2016a 2016b baiamonte 2016c the analytical solution of baiamonte et al 2015 provided the maximum number of emitters in the uphill and downhill sides of the lateral and therefore to the optimal lateral length by imposing constant emitter flow rates and a pressure head tolerance δ 10 of its nominal value along the entire lateral more recently baiamonte 2016a 2016b 2018 simplified the analytical design procedure introduced by baiamonte et al 2015 which required solving a system of four implicit equations by deriving simple explicit relationships as a function of 16 calibration constants this simplified procedure derived the design variables required for the optimal paired lateral with a relative error less than 2 moreover the author identified exactly the best position of the manifold bmp associated with the optimal paired lateral design in a sloping field which resulted for flat fields equal to 0 24 whereas for complex field topography this value differs from 0 24 depending on the concavity or the convexity shape of the paired lateral baiamonte 2017a it is interesting to observe that bmp 0 24 for uniform sloped laterals and bmp 0 5 for horizontal laterals match with those derived by the extended design procedure for complex field topography in particular both bmp values are attained for particular values of the curvature parameter of the field where the lateral lays β 1 and β respectively see fig 8 of baiamonte 2017a for very irregular slopes only the sbs procedure should be used by locating the manifold at a position that results in same minimum pressure at uphill and downhill laterals in this paper for uniformly sloped paired drip laterals even simpler design relationships will be derived that only require a few constants 3 and that show the influence of the flow rate and pipe diameter exponents of the resistance equation on the design variables as the procedures previously introduced baiamonte et al 2015 baiamonte 2016a this proposed procedure is a partial approach since it is valid only for one lateral units and cannot be used to irrigation units of branching pipe networks with many laterals and one manifold on the other hand because of its simplicity it is also usable by the general public and addresses the main interest of the farmer i e the uniformity of water distribution without requiring the classic sbs hydraulic design of the irrigation system and the use of a personal computer it reproduces the results of the analytical approach introduced by baiamonte et al 2015 well with relative errors that are a bit greater than 2 and extends design relationships to i any imposed pressure head tolerance and ii to the hazen williams resistance equation which is also widely accepted for smooth wall polyethylene pipe especially when the reynolds number exceeds 105 relationships will be provided for downward paired laterals bmp 0 24 for the most common case in which the paired laterals are laid on flat fields bmp 0 5 for both corresponding layouts downward and flat in which the manifold is located at the boundary of the irrigation unit bmp 0 and finally for upward laterals for which only bmp 0 can be thus there are five considered layouts all together that are summarized in table 1 evaluations highlighting the effects of design choices in terms of energy saving which could have a certain impact by an economic point of view are discussed for the considered five layouts by neglecting manufacturing coefficient of variation comparisons between optimal lateral lengths and analyses of lateral pressure head variability and emission uniformity coefficient are carried out then for the five layouts we present and discuss applications of the proposed relationships considering different design parameters 2 the optimal paired drip lateral in a downward sloping field layout 1 and the best manifold position bmp in fig 1 for each of the considered five layouts a lateral pressure head distribution line is qualitatively illustrated table 1 reports the slope s sign negative downward the number of emitters depending on the best manifold position bmp the corresponding design equations and the average coefficient of variation of pressure head cv as illustrated in the following the optimal design of paired drip laterals on uniform slopes baiamonte et al 2015 baiamonte 2016a is moved up by the motion equations expressing pressure head variations of the i th emitter hi along the uphill side of the lateral hi u as well as along the downhill side of the lateral hi d the motion equations are valid under the assumption that we can neglect i the variations of emitters flow rate along the lateral christiansen 1942 zayani et al 2001 as well as ii the local losses due to emitters insertions so that the morphology of emitter connections does not produce significant reductions of the lateral cross section accordingly these equations are rewritten here 1a h i u s h max u s k h n u r h n u i r i s 0 1b h i d s h max u s k h n d r h n d i r i s 0 in which r denotes the flow rate

m2 s 1 is water s kinematic viscosity which according to blasius s equation for a standard water temperature at 20 c gives k 0 000779 whereas according to hazen williams s equation c is a friction coefficient which is a function of the pipe material s characteristics baiamonte et al 2015 analytically solved the design problem of paired drip laterals in a uniformly sloping field by fixing r 1 75 and a pressure head tolerance δ 0 1 the hypothesis i to neglect the variation of emitters flow rates agrees with the latter assumption of fixing pressure head tolerance δ in fact along the lateral it is under limited pressure head variations that the ratio between the emitters flow rate variation q max qmin and its average qn is small it should be less than 10 providing a good approximation of this hypothesis wu 1997 vallesquino and luque escamilla 2002 the system of 4 equations leading to the optimal paired drip lateral design is rewritten here by generalizing for any δ and for any r i e for any exponent of the resistance equation eq 2 and by highlighting the scale role of the emitter spacing in lateral designing by mean of the normalized pressure head in respect to the emitter

it is noteworthy that for a fixed k only the discharge exponent of the resistance equation affects the system solution for r 1 75 and r 1 852 ζ 1 r is equal to 0 1336 and 0 1108 respectively for a fixed r δ k i e qn and d h n and s the system of the four eqs 4 7 can be solved obtaining the analytical solution nu nd imin s0 for which operating pressure heads along the entire lateral are in the desired range 1 δ h n h i 1 δ h n thus the knowledge of nu and nd and the related optimal number of the emitters installed in the entire lateral nopt nu nd yielding the optimal length lopt s nopt requires the solution of the four eqs 4 7 baiamonte 2016a 2016b 2018 simplified the solution to design paired drip laterals in sloping fields by using exponential laws and power functions that approximate the analytical solution very well this solution is based on 4 calibration parameters for each unknown variable nu nd imin s0 16 calibration parameters in total to test the capability of eq 4 7 to estimate nu nd imin s0 and the associated nopt necessary for the optimal design of drip paired laterals baiamonte 2016a calculated the relative errors re as a function of k for h n 5 10 20 and 40 re were calculated by assuming that the corresponding analytical values obtained by solving the system of eqs 4 7 were true the author showed that re was less than 2 demonstrating the applicability of the proposed procedure in order to show the effect of h n on the approximated procedure fig 2 a for five values of k k 10 7 10 6 10 5 10 4 and 10 3 and under the assumption of blasius resistance equation reports the relative errors re on the estimate of n o p t as a function of h n by the procedure suggested by baiamonte 2016a the results show that relative errors rapidly diminish as h n increases for h n 3 and in any case endure within a very narrow range in the same figure the only slightly higher relative errors re for the estimate of nopt solid lines for another simpler and much more manageable design relationship presented below are also reported the optimal paired drip lateral designed according to baiamonte 2016a associated with eqs 4 7 requires a particular position of the manifold denoted as the best manifold position bmp defined as the ratio between the number of the emitters in the uphill lateral nu and the optimal number of the emitters in the entire lateral nopt by introducing approximated and explicit design relationships to derive the optimal nu and nd baiamonte 2016a showed that the bmp is slightly affected by h n and k in their usual range of variability approaching a value very close to 0 24 for r 1 75 under the blasius resistance equation eq 3a the author emphasized that bmp 0 24 is valid if the number of the uphill and downhill emitters are the optimal values so that h min u h min d 1 δ h n and h max u h max d 1 δ h n in this paper bmp will denote any other manifold position satisfying the latter condition such as the well known bmp 0 5 fig 1c for a flat lateral as well as bmp 0 if the laterals are not paired fig 1b d and e much simpler design relationships providing errors only a bit larger than those derived by baiamonte 2016a and that also require an imposed bmp can be derived by solving by substitution the eqs system 4 7 and by forcing the relationships between the design variables to follow a linear or power function described below after a little algebra for a fixed distance between the minimum pressure at the downhill lateral and its top end nd imin and for a fixed r the system of eqs 4 7 can be reduced to only two dimensionless equations for the two unknowns nu and nd 8a h n d i min r h n u r h n d i min 1 r ζ 1 r r n d i min n u 8b h n d i min 1 r ζ 1 r h n d r r n d the analytical bmp nu nu nd cannot be expressed by eqs 8a and 8b in an explicit form however for any optimal nd imin satisfying eqs 8a and 8b it can usefully be represented as a function of the number of emitters in the uphill lateral nu with the discharge exponent r of the resistance equation as a parameter as illustrated in fig 3 the considered r values in fig 3 are those of eqs 8a and 8b r 1 75 and r 1 852 and just for r 2 that corresponds to the exponent of the well known darcy weisbach formula the figure shows that for an nu greater than around 10 bmp becomes constant assuming values 0 2396 0 2478 0 2560 for r 1 75 1 871 and 2 respectively and confirms the bmp value close to 0 24 that baiamonte 2016a for r 1 75 obtained by the approximated relationships an application of eqs 8a and 8b for fixed exponent r showed that an almost linear and simpler relationship occurs between nu nd and nd imin 9a n u b 0 1 n d i min 9b n d b 0 2 n d i min in which b0 1 in b0 1 are numerical coefficients which only depend on r by combining eqs 9a and 9b the relationship between nd and nu under the condition of the optimal maximum length lateral design we can derived 10 n u b 0 1 b 0 2 n d which shows that the ratio b0 b0 1 b0 2 can be expressed as a function of the bmp according to the following relationship 11 b 0 b m p 1 b m p interestingly b0 and bmp does not depend on the pressure tolerance δ and only depends on the discharge exponent r of the pipe resistance formula according to the results illustrated in fig 3 bmp in eq 11 can reasonably be fixed as a constant rounded to two decimal places which is advisable in practice thus by fixing bmp 24 25 and 26 of the entire paired drip lateral for r 1 75 1 871 and 2 the corresponding b0 constant can be evaluated yielding b0 0 316 0 333 and 0 351 respectively therefore b0 cannot be considered a calibration parameter of the actual design procedure but simply a consequence of the choice to fix bmp the optimal number of the emitters of the paired lateral nopt can be linked to the normalized emitter pressure head h n and to the lateral slope s0 by considering the system of eq 4 7 and 10 12 n o p t n u n d b 1 δ h n s 0 in which b1 is a numerical constant that only depends on r and that will be determined by calibration therefore under the hypothesis nu 10 which is widely accepted in practice the number of the emitters of the uphill and downhill lateral nu and nd can be obtained by simply considering the imposed bmp which only slightly depends on the selected flow rate exponent of the resistance equation fig 3 13a n u b 1 b m p δ h n s 0 13b n d b 1 1 b m p δ h n s 0 once the optimal number of emitters has been derived the hydraulic and geometric characteristics of the emitters of the drip lateral have to be determined in other words for the optimal design of the lateral the relationship between the k constant expressed by eq 2 and the optimal number of the emitters of eq 13 is necessary analogously to the derivation of eq 12 an application of eqs 4 7 fit a power function 14 n o p t n u n d b 2 s 0 k 1 r in which like b0 and b1 b2 only depends on the exponent r and together with b1 will be determined by calibration thus analogously to eq 13 the number of the emitters of the uphill and downhill lateral can be obtained as a function of k 15a n u b 2 b m p s 0 k 1 r 15b n d b 2 1 b m p s 0 k 1 r finally by combing eqs 12 and 14 the relationships between the main dimensionless parameters h n and k for the verification problem k is known eq 16b as well as for the design problem h n are known eq 16a we can derive 16a k b 2 b 1 r s 0 1 r δ h n r 16b h n b 2 b 1 s 0 1 1 r δ k 1 r it is noteworthy that because of eq 16b the pressure head distribution line of the optimal paired drip lateral expressed by eq 1 only depends on the k value on the lateral slope s0 and on b1 and b2 by considering eq 2 eq 16b can be rewritten depending on the design problem of the lateral by defining i the internal pipe diameter d if qn is fixed and ii the average emitter discharge qn if d is fixed 17a d k 1 s b 1 b 2 r s q n δ h n r s s 0 1 r s 17b q n b 2 b 1 k 1 r d s r s 0 1 r r δ h n eqs 17a and 17b appear much simpler in respect to those previously derived baiamonte 2016a and better show the influence of the exponents r and s on the optimal lateral design furthermore they are monomial and their use requires only 2 calibration constants in respect to the previous 16 b1 and b2 constants were determined for a set of common values of pipe diameters flow rates pressure heads and emitter s spacing to refer to usual values of these parameters some examples of drip irrigation system manufacturer catalogues were shown tables 2 4 report the value of the maximum lengths for drip laterals laid on flat fields suggested by three manufacturers denoted a b and c for different flow rates qn inside pipe diameters d emitter s spacing s and nominal pressure heads hn values according to the corresponding catalogues which are available on the manufacturer s website for these design parameters k values are in the range 7 00 10 7 2 09 10 5 to extend the calibration to other design parameters which can usually be selected for sprinkler irrigation systems where higher flow rates are used the k range was extended to higher k values 10 3 10 7 for a very high number of k values 10000 in such range the optimal slope and the b1 and b2 constants were determined by satisfying the optimization procedure according to the objective functions expressed by the system 18 h n b 2 b 1 s 0 1 1 r k 1 r δ b 1 δ h n s 0 b m p 2 δ h n s

the maximum admitted pressure head 1 δ h n at the inlet e g at the connection laterals manifold and at the top end downward lateral and ii of the minimum admitted 1 δ h n at the top end upward lateral and for a certain emitter i imin in the downhill lateral the optimization procedure was carried out for blasius hazen williams and darcy weisbach resistance equation bmp 0 24 0 25 and 0 26 corresponding to b0 0 316 0 333 and 0 351 in each case the calibration gave values of the b1 and b2 variables in a very narrow range verifying the functional links expressed by eqs 12 and 14 with the variation coefficients equal to about 0 07 and 0 16 respectively the calibration provided the values b1 and b2 reported in table 5 which can be used for practical applications for the blasius hazen williams and darcy weisbach resistance equation in the following the optimal number of the emitters for the optimal paired drip lateral design according to the blasius equation r 1 75 and k 0 000779 obtained by substituting of b0 0 316 b1 7 35 and b2 2 34 into eqs 12 and 14 are reported 19a n o p t 7 35 δ h n s 0 19b n o p t 2 34 s 0 k 0 571 whereas eq 16 which links the main dimensionless parameters h n and k for the verification problem as well as for the design problem becomes 20a k 0 135 s 0 2 75 δ h n 1 75 20b h 0 319 s 0 1 571 δ k 0 571 for the blasius resistance equation in the following the design relationships eq 17 for the internal pipe diameter d and for the average emitter flow rate qn are also reported 21a d 0 338 q n δ h n 0 368 s 0 0 579 21b q n 19 03 d 2 714 s 0 1 571 δ h n as the following will show later each of the calibrated eqs 19 20 and 21 can be applied to find the design variables required to design optimal paired drip laterals or to produce very simple design charts for r 1 75 relative errors re for nopt estimates associated with eqs 19 20 and 21 are graphed in fig 2b by assuming as true the corresponding analytical values obtained by solving the system of eqs 4 7 as a function of h n solid lines for different k values in between the range already considered for calibration k 10 7 10 6 10 5 10 4 and 10 3 re for nopt can be compared with the corresponding ones obtained in fig 2a by using the simplified equations previously introduced baiamonte 2016a the figure shows that in respect to the latter eqs 19 20 and 21 provide errors that are only slightly larger re becomes less than 2 5 for h n 10 and decreases more and more as the normalized pressure head increases for a fixed h n re increases with k probably because of the fixed b0 bmp values as a matter of fact the increasing of re with k shown in fig 2b agrees with the differences between bmp and the fixed bmp that also increase with k as previously observed for r 1 75 baiamonte 2016a however the simplicity of the newer procedure definitely rewards the associated slightly greater re for the nopt estimate with respect to those associated with the analytical baiamonte et al 2015 or the better approximated procedure baiamonte 2016a this described procedure can be applied to both drip lateral irrigation systems as well as to sprinkler irrigation systems without diminishing its usefulness furthermore the method can be used to extend the application of the drip lateral lengths suggested by the manufacturers which generally are only valid for drip laterals laid on flat fields to drip laterals laid on sloping fields 3 application examples the choice of eqs 19 20 and 21 to use for practical application depends on the verification or design problem that has to be solved if it is a new or an already implemented irrigation system and on the knowledge of the involved parameters in the following the verification and design problems are described by assuming as is usually the case that the length of the irrigation unit i e the number of the emitters to be installed along the paired lateral nopt and the emitter spacing s are already assigned moreover because a trickle irrigations design is strongly influenced by the internal pipe diameter and there are only a few values of available internal pipe diameters the latter will be considered as assigned since nopt s and d are known in this context the verification problem conventionally denotes the case in which the emitters pressure head has to be determined whereas for the design problem the emitter pressure head is known and the flow rate has to be established in the following we apply the procedure to solve a design problem in such terms in fig 4 a by assuming the blasius equation for a pressure tolerance δ 0 1 and for a fixed diameter d 11 6 mm the optimal lateral length nopt expressed by eq 19a is graphed as a function of s0 with h n as a parameter as expected the figure shows that as the lateral slope increases the optimal emitter number decreases furthermore for a fixed slope the higher the normalized pressure head is the longer the lateral lengths are in the same figure for the same normalized pressure head values as the parameter the secondary axis shows the flow rate vs the lateral slope expressed by eq 21b interestingly the latter shows that for a fixed h n and as expected an increase in slope determines on the one hand as already observed a decrease in nopt and on the other hand an increase in flow rate the same figure also illustrates how a numerical application showing how the combined use of eqs 19a and 21b leads to the solution as example for a fixed optimal number of emitters nopt 145 and a mean lateral slope s0 13 5 corresponds a normalized pressure head h n 26 7 which can be associated to different possible pairs hn s 40 1 5 33 1 24 20 0 75 or 10 0 375 the corresponding optimal length of the lateral lopt s nopt will be 217 5 181 3 108 8

eq 1 i e by considering the exponent of the flow rate pressure head relationships q k hx x 0 the pressure head distribution line and the hydraulic grade line were graphed white dots and black dots respectively by using the iterative forward step by step sbs procedure starting from the manifold connection to the end of both the downhill and the uphill sides of the lateral the pressure head distribution line was also graphed by setting the exponent of the flow rate pressure head relationships x 0 5 dashed line according to previous results see baiamonte et al 2015 fig 7 and baiamonte 2016a fig 11 the figure shows that differences in pressure head distributions under the two assumptions x 0 and x 0 5 are very moderate by neglecting the manufacturing coefficient of variation cv and following sbs procedure the pressure head coefficient of variation cv and the emission uniformity coefficient eu keller and karmeli 1975 associated with the two assumptions were also calculated they resulted cv 6 25 and the obvious eu 100 for x 0 and cv 6 04 and eu 95 8 for x 0 5 thus fig 4b allows the proposed design procedure to be verified once the drip lateral length extreme pressure heads are satisfied h min u h min d 1 δ h n and h max u h max d 1 δ h n with δ 0 1 providing the maximum energy and hydraulic efficiency in the paired drip lateral design for both assumptions x 0 and x 0 5 and thus including not pressure compensating emitter in order to extend the proposed procedure to any values of the involved parameters of the optimal paired drip lateral fig 5 a charts the design problem and fig 5b charts the verification problem graphing eqs 19a and 20a with h n as a parameter and eqs 19b and 20b with k as a parameter respectively in both figures the previous numerical example is also represented for the design problem the chart application gives k 1 10 4 close to the solution that was obtained analytically whereas the verification chart application provides h n 26 7 of course for these k and h n any congruent optimal pairs for qn and d and as mentioned for hn and s can be selected to provide an optimal paired lateral in a sloping field furthermore both graphs can be used by reversing the secondary vertical axis to the main axis for example this would be useful if the maximum length of the lateral is not fixed but is instead to be determined in the next section by introducing a third last calibration constant the optimal lateral lengths are derived for the case in which the manifold is located at the top end of the drip laterals bmp 0 in a flat field s0 0 for which manufacturer catalogues already provide values and for sloping on uphill and downhill fields which are particular cases of the previous paired lateral systems 4 manifold at the top beginning of the laterals bmp 0 layout 2 4 and 5 the procedure previously described allows the optimal design of a paired drip lateral in sloping fields to be elaborated by locating the manifold according to the blasius equation at 24 of the entire optimal length of the lateral bmp 0 24 fig 1a for a fixed inlet pressure head at the manifold e g 1 1 hn it is evident that the solution bmp 0 24 provides lateral lengths greater than 24 in respect to those obtained by locating the manifold at the top end of the lateral i e by considering only the downhill lateral nu 0 also for flat terrain s0 0 for which the lengths l suggested by the manufacturer catalogue can be considered the manifold connection can be conveniently located in the center of the laterals bmp 0 5 so that for a fixed inlet pressure heads at the manifold δ hn provides doubled lengths 2 l notwithstanding the fact that the following solutions bmp 0 for flat fields as well as for sloping uphill and downhill fields layout 2 4 and 5 of table 1 are not convenient from an irrigation efficiency point of view they are described in the following because sometimes these solutions are preferred by the farmers they facilitate the underground manifold pipe s repair by making it easier to excavate since it is not located in between crop rows fig 1b d and e furthermore depending on the chosen manifold material the bmp 0 24 or bmp 0 5 requires a double number of connections of the paired drip laterals which can have an important role on the amount of costs that the farmers have to sustain 4 1 lateral laid on downward sloping fields bmp 0 nu 0 s0 0 layout 2 drip lateral design equations for downward sloping fields when the manifold is located at the boundary of the irrigation sector bmp 0 fig 1b is a particular case of the previously illustrated equations for the case nu 0 s0 0 only eqs 13b and 15b need considering giving 22a n o p t 5 58 δ h n s 0 22b n o p t 1 778 s 0 k 0 571 as for layout 1 for eq 22a or eq 22b to be applied it needs to be coupled to eqs 20 or eq 21 fig 6 a for r 1 75 for δ 0 1 for qn 5 l h and d 32 mm k 5 52 10 7 and for hn 22 5 m and s 1 5 m h n 15 illustrates the pressure head distribution for an optimal lateral designed according to eqs 22a and 21b giving nd 590 and s0 1 42 by comparing eqs 19a and 22a and by considering eq 21a it is interesting to observe for sloping laterals how much less convenient the choice bmp 0 is in respect to bmp 0 24 in particular for a fixed lateral length the emitters flow rate and slope and for any pressure head tolerance the corresponding optimal design requires the emitters pressure head and pipe diameter to be greater than 32 and 11 respectively hn 2 hn 1 d 2 d 1 in table 6 4 2 lateral laid on flat fields bmp 0 s0 0 layout 4 to detect the effect of the field slope on the optimal maximum lateral lengths for the case bmp 0 24 or 0 5 fig 1a with those obtained for the case bmp 0 fig 1d the latter needs to be formulated as it is well known in the simplest case in which the lateral laid on a level field s0 0 the minimum pressure head is located at the downstream end of the lateral i min nd nopt for any k value thus in this case the admitted minimum of the pressure head 1 δ hn needs to be imposed at the downhill end of the laterals i nd into eq 6 which considering h n d i min r 0 and s0 0 yields 23 2 δ h n k h n d r to facilitate the designing of laterals laid on flat fields a power law can be used in place of eq 23 obtaining a relationship between the main dimensionless parameters for the verification problem h n vs nopt if k

calibration constant for designing the five considered layouts table 1 in addition to b1 and b2 valid for sloped laterals eq 18 for horizontal laterals f0 was evaluated for the blasius hazen williams and darcy weisbach resistance equation giving 1 85 1 83 and 1 81 respectively for a set of design variables s0 qn d s h n fig 6b illustrates the relative error re for the estimate of the optimal number of the emitters nopt by eq 24c associated to the optimal design of a drip lateral laid on a level field s0 0 and to the blasius resistance equation as a function of nopt dashed line by assuming the analytical values obtained by eq 23 as the true re markedly diminishes with increasing nopt and becomes negligible less than 1 for nopt 30 suggesting that eq 24 is suitable for optimally designing drip laterals on flat fields the standard error estimate see associated to eq 24c is very small equal to 2 89 as fig 6b shows the relative errors re associated to eq 24c are lower than those associated to eq 19 valid for sloped laterals and bmp 0 24 very similar errors were obtained by assuming the hazen william resistance equation fig 6a illustrates an example application for the same design variables considered for layout 2 the pressure head distribution obtained by designing the drip lateral with eq 24 that for nopt 590 results in between the admitted range 0 9 hn hi 1 1 hn of course for flat fields the results can be easily extended to the case in which the manifold is located in the middle of the lateral bmp 0 5 by simply doubling the obtained optimal lengths by considering eq 24c it is interesting to observe that in respect to bmp 0 5 the choice bmp 0 is much less convenient because for fixed lateral length the emitters flow rate and pipe diameter and for any pressure head tolerance the corresponding optimal design requires the emitters pressure head to be 6 7 times greater hn 3 hn 4 in table 6 4 3 lateral laid on upward sloping fields bmp 0 nd 0 s0 0 layout 5 here we consider the design of drip lateral relationships for upward sloping fields when the manifold is located at the boundary of the irrigation sector bmp 0 fig 1e even though we know that this condition is not to be preferred we will consider it in the following because this position may be necessary if the overall structure of the irrigation system necessitates this design thus for this case nd 0 s0 0 only eqs 13a and 15a yielding 25a n o p t 1 763 δ h n s 0 25b n o p t 0 562 s 0 k 0 571 analogously to the previous cases as an application example by using the same design variables of layout 2 and 4 again fig 6a illustrates the pressure head distribution obtained by designing the drip lateral with eq 25a which with the expected smallest value nopt 186 is the best choice since it is between the admitted range 0 9 hn hi 1 1 hn the typical almost linear behavior of the pressure heads along the upward lateral is also qualitatively indicated in layout 5 of fig 1e which strongly differs from that of the corresponding downward lateral layout 2 fig 1b a comparison in respect to layout 2 can be carried out for layout 5 the choice of an upward lateral for a fixed lateral length emitters flow rate and pipe diameter and for any pressure head tolerance as expected is much less convenient because the corresponding optimal design requires the emitters pressure head and pipe diameter to be 3 2 times and 1 5 greater respectively in respect to the downward lateral see table 6 5 58 1 763 and 5 58 1 763 r 4 75 with r 1 75 5 energetic evaluations for the considered five layouts considering the increasing demand and price for energy are affecting all economic sectors including irrigated agriculture fernández garcía et al 2015 an inspection on the energetic performance of each considering layouts was in the following carried out to show and compare the energetic advantages of each of the considered layouts eqs 19 20 and 21 for layout 1 and eqs 22 24 and 25 for those corresponding to the other layouts were reformulated to derive the hn ratios for the 20 combinations of the five considered layouts 3 main hn ratio relationships were derived one for comparing both sloped lateral layouts e g hn 2 hn 1 7 35 5 58 one for a mixed comparison of sloped and horizontal laterals e g hn 4 hn 1 19 03 r 7 35 25 1 r and the last one for comparing both horizontal laterals e g hn 4 hn 3 50 25 1 r the remaining 7 hn ratios can be determined by the three mentioned relationships by substituting the design relationship coefficients of the corresponding layout with the exception of the 19 03 coefficient eq 21 b which is constant for any sloped layout 1 2 or 5 table 6 reports the hn ratios for the 20 possible combinations in the table the hn ratios corresponding to the mentioned comparisons already carried out in the previous section for bmp 0 can be observed hn 2 hn 1 1 32 hn 4 hn 3 6 7 hn 5 hn 2 3 17 values in round brackets indicate the corresponding ratio referring to the inside diameter thus from an energetic point of view the hn ratios lets us predict the economic advantages or disadvantages of each layout for example the value 1 32 1 11 under the main diagonal of the matrix as already observed indicates that for the same design variables nopt qn δ s layout 2 requires a nominal pressure head and lateral diameter 32 and 11 greater than that corresponding to layout 1 the hn ratios over the main diagonal of the matrix are of course the reciprocals of those reported under it the hn 3 hn 1 and hn 3 hn 2 ratios are noteworthy 0 89 and 0 42 respectively because they back up what it is well known in irrigation design i e bmp 0 5 in flat fields is the best efficiency choice for the manifold it is interesting to observe that by excluding the cases hn 2 hn 1 hn 5 hn 1 and hn 5 hn 2 2 for which the pipe diameters for the comparing layouts are not the same values in brackets in table 6 the remaining pressure head ratios are valid for any lateral length emitter spacing flow rate pressure head tolerance pipe material and diameter too thus it is expected that the same h ratios can be extended to the corresponding energy ratios since the latter two are linearly related with similar implications by an economic point of view finally the value hn 4 hn 3 6 7 is close to 8 that baiamonte 2017b found for the horizontal layouts for bmp 0 and for bmp 0 5 by using close form solutions of the required pressure heads derived under the darcy weisbach resistance formula 6 comparing optimal lateral lengths for sloping fields and for flat fields under the assumption of the blasius resistance equation in order to compare optimal lateral lengths for flat fields and for sloping fields as well as the two different manifold positions i e inside the irrigation sector layout 3 bmp 0 5 for flat fields fig 1c and layout 1 bmp 0 24 for sloping fields fig 1a and at the boundary of the irrigation sector layout 2 4 and 5 bmp 0 for both sloping fields fig 1b e and flat fields fig 1d the associated optimal lateral length relationships are derived below for sloping fields and bmp 0 24 by combining eqs 19a and 21 the following relationship of the optimal length l o p t s 0 0 was obtained 26a l o p t s 0 0 207 4 s h n 1 1 r δ d s 1 r q n r 1 r for b m p 0 24 l a y o u t 1 eq 26a could misrepresent the influence of the slopes on the optimal lateral length which explicitly does not figure into it in fact it must be noted that eq 26a is only valid if the lateral slopes satisfy eqs 21 which in turn must also satisfy the optimal number of the emitters expressed by eq 19b and 26a optimal lengths for a paired drip lateral laid on a flat field can be expressed by combining eq 24c and eq 2 with the k constant for r 1 75 equal to 0 000779 and by considering bmp 0 5 yielding 26b l o p t s 0 0 50 s δ 1 1 r h n 1 1 r d s 1 r q n r 1 r for b m p 0 5 layout 3 by assuming as usual δ 0 1 a comparison between eq 26a and eq 26b states that for optimal lateral laid in flat fields for which bmp 0 5 and for optimal lateral for which bmp 0 24 the associated optimal lateral lengths are very close nevertheless differences in term of hn were higher analogously to eqs 26 for the manifold located at the boundary of the irrigation sector bmp 0 fig 1b similar equations can be derived for sloping uphill and downhill fields to determine the optimal lengths of drip laterals eqs 22a and 21 have to be combined yielding 27a l o p t s 0 0 157 6 s h n 1 1 r δ d s 1 r q n r 1 r for b m p 0 layout 2 for laterals laid on flat fields with bmp 0 the optimal drip lateral length can be simply obtained by halving the optimal length expressed by eq 26b 27b l o p t s 0 0 25 s δ 1 1 r h n 1 1 r d s 1 r q n r 1 r for b m p 0 layout 4 whereas for upward sloping laterals by combining eqs 25a and 21 the corresponding optimal length l o p t s 0 0 can be obtained 27c l o p t s 0 0 4 97 s h n 1 1 r δ d s 1 r q n r 1 r for b m p 0 layout 5 it is apparent that the coefficients appearing into eqs 26 and 27 only depend on the bmp value b0 on the calibration coefficients b1 b2 f0 and on k a comparison between eqs 27a and 27b states that for bmp 0 the optimal design on a downward sloping fields provides lateral lengths that are significantly higher than those for flat fields l o p t s 0 0 1 46 l o p t s 0 0 thus manufacturer catalogues can significantly underestimate the lateral length if the slope is ignored on the contrary for uphill fields a comparison between eqs 27a and 27c yields l o p t s 0 0 0 05 l o p t s 0 0 indicating the well known great incorrectness of locating the manifold at the boundary of the irrigation unit when the fields are upwards it is noteworthy that the compared coefficients in eqs 26 0 96 and eqs 27 1 46 and 0 05 are influenced by the pressure head tolerance δ as an example they increase to 1 24 and 1 88 and 0 06 as the pressure head tolerance δ increases from 0 1 to 0 15 7 validating optimal lateral lengths for flat fields design relationships obtained for flat fields eqs 24c or 27b even if already tested by the application illustrated in fig 6a solid line can be used as a verification via a comparison with the lateral lengths l suggested by the manufacturers table 2 4 since the same hypotheses are valid s0 0 and bmp 0 fig 7 reports the number of emitters suggested by the catalogues in abscissa computed as l s for three different manufacturers a b and c and the corresponding number of the optimal emitters in ordinate calculated by eq 27b by assuming δ 0 1 and n o p t l o p t s 0 0 s it can be observed that for the manufacturers a and b only a few pairs are far from the line of perfect agreement this is probably due to the fact that as the catalogue says the suggested lengths are subject to change due to changes in the conditions in which the tests were performed or because the considered resistance equation in the catalogue is different from the well accepted blasius equation considered here thus for manufacturers a and b the pairs are almost next to the line of perfect agreement whereas for the manufacturer c eq 27b underestimates the number of the emitters however this discrepancy must be due to the fact that as reported in the catalogue the lateral length suggested by the manufacturer does not agree with the optimal design criteria assumed in all of the proposed design relationships which should be preferred to fix at the last emitter the most disadvantaged in flat fields to assure a pressure head equal to δ hn as a matter of fact see table 4 footnote a pressure head equal to 0 7 bar is assumed independently of the nominal pressure head of the emitter in other words the last emitter for the suggested length operates as an example for a nominal pressure head pn 4 bar according to eq 27b it could operate with a pressure near to the nominal one pe 0 9 hn 0 9 4 3 6 bar whereas according to the catalogue it should operate with a pressure head much lower than the nominal one pe 0 7 bar thus drip lateral lengths suggested in the catalogue are greater than those corresponding to the suggested design relationships to the detriment of flow rate uniformity 8 analysis of lateral pressure head variability cv and emission uniformity coefficient eu for the considered five layouts interesting analysis and discussion about the coefficient of variation of water distribution and emission uniformity were carried out by royuela tomás et al 2005 and juana et al 2004 who provided analytical solutions in this section under the assumption of the mentioned hypothesis and for the selected five layouts relationships to determine the pressure head coefficient of variation cv and emission uniformity coefficient according to keller and karmeli 1975 are derived as observed because of eq 20b for sloping laterals and eq 24a for horizontal laterals the pressure head distribution of the optimal lateral only depends on the k parameter and on the slope value s0 by neglecting manufacturing coefficient of variation for the k values ranging between 10 3 10 7 pressure head uniformity has been investigated by considering the drip laterals of the five layouts reported in table 1 by considering eq 1 the coefficient of variation cv was calculated for each layout and for each k value according to the derived relationship 28a

is expressed according to eq 20b for sloped laterals or to eq 24a for horizontal laterals for layout 3 for which bmp 0 5 nu nd and s0 0 and for layouts 2 4 and 5 for which bmp 0 nu 0 or nd 0 eq 28a reduces to 28b c v n i 1 n 1 δ h n k h n r h n i r i s 0 2 i 1 n 1 δ h n k h n r h n i r i s 0 2 1 where n nu or nd depending on the layout and whether the sign of s0 is or depending on whether the field is downhill or uphill respectively for layout 1 downward sloping laterals for a fixed k value k 10 3 10 4 and 10 5 and for different pressure head tolerances δ 0 1 0 07 0 05 and 0 03 fig 8 illustrates cv as a function of s0 for the highest k value fig 8a cv seems to vary with s0 variability over a constant cv value tends to vanish with a decreasing k until it completely disappears for the lowest k value long laterals fig 8c this cv behavior can be justified for the low k values for which for any δ the number of the emitters especially in the uphill side can be low e g 10 15 as can be observed by eq 14 and eqs 15 in fact for a low number of emitters the calibrated parameters may not result in the working range see fig 3 pushing the lateral farther from the optimal operating pressure head range some dispersion over the constant cv value can also be justified by the necessary rounding to the integer in applying eq 28 table 1 reports the mean value cv for 3 values of the pressure head tolerance δ 0 1 0 07 and 0 03 which as expected increases with δ and varies in a very narrow range as illustrated in fig 9 a cv and δ are linearly correlated the angular coefficients mcv also reported in the figure can be used to set the desired cv value in designing optimal laterals once the corresponding pressure head tolerance δ is calculated by the equation indicated in the figure analogously to cv also the familiar design emission uniformity coefficient eu of keller and karmeli 1975 commonly used for the evaluation of the performance of drip irrigation systems associated with the proposed procedure was derived baiamonte 2016b 29a e u 100 1 1 27 c v n p n u n d 1 δ h n i 1 n u 1 δ h n k h n u r h n u i r i s 0 i 1 n d 1 δ h n k h n d r h n d i r i s 0 x where x is the exponent of the flow rate pressure head relationships np are the number of emitters per plant cv is the manufacturing coefficient of variation q min and qav are the minimum and the average emitter flow rates in the lateral for layouts 2 3 4 and 5 eq 29a reduces to 29b e u 100 1 1 27 c v n p n 1 δ h n i 1 n 1 δ h n k h n r h n i r i s 0 x where n refers to the total number of the emitters of the lateral and the sign of s0 is or depending on whether the field is downhill or uphill respectively by neglecting the manufacturing coefficient of variation cv eq 29a and eq 29b are illustrated in fig 9b which shows a linear relationship between eu and δ also indicated in the figure together with the corresponding angular coefficient meu as for cv fig 9b the latter can be used to determine the laterals pressure head tolerance of the δ corresponding to a desired eu value the figure shows that as expected with increasing of δ cv increases whereas eu decreases moreover layout 1 and 2 downward sloped fields and layout 3 and 4 horizontal fields have the same behavior in terms of cv and eu for any layout it is also interesting to observe that the design procedure allows a lateral to be designed with the maximum length optimizing water use efficiency wue assuring low values of pressure head variability cv 6 1 for δ 0 1 and high values of emission uniformity eu 95 for δ 0 1 interestingly cv and eu values corresponding to layout 1 inversely derived by the relationships indicated in fig 9ab for δ 0 1 match with those calculated for the example of the application illustrated in fig 4b where the exact sbs procedure was applied cv 6 2 and eu 96 0 the latter showed that the considered assumption x 0 also in computing the average for cv eq 28 and for eu eq 29 and the standard deviation for cv eq 28 of emitters pressure heads provide satisfactory results further investigations are carried out below which aim to detect variations of cv as a function of the slope for laterals designed according to the proposed procedure under the assumption that the lateral is laid on a flat field for bmp 0 5 and for bmp 0 in respect to fig 8 the role of the slope is different in fig 8 the slope corresponds to the optimal design whereas it varies in the actual context for r 1 75 δ 0 1 and for two values of k 7 10 7 and 8 10 6 and h n 10 and 120 fig 10 illustrates the coefficient of variation cv as a function of the field slope for bmp 0 5 fig 10a and for bmp 0 fig 10b in both cases the number of the emitters is the optimal 2 nd and nd calculated by eq 24c for s0 0 for both bmp values layout 3 and 4 as reported in table 1 fig 10 shows that for s0 0 cv 5 9 moreover depending on the bmp value it is interesting to observe a different effect of the lateral slope on cv for bmp 0 5 for any h n and k values because of the minimum admitted pressure head at the two extreme ends of the lateral 0 9 hn cv monotonically increases with the lateral slope in fact any s0 0 values shows a decrease at the top end pressure head of the lateral hi u 0 9 hn and an increasing pressure head at the bottom end of the lateral hi d 1 1 hn contrarily for bmp 0 in a certain low range of s0 cv decreases with increasing s0 showing a minimum cv value cvmin equal to 2 over which cv as for bmp 0 5 increases with s0 this cv behavior appears reasonable if one considers that as the slope increases from s0 0 cv reductions are determined by the increasing of the pressure head at the top end of the lateral starting from 0 9 hn also imposed for s0 0 because of the imposed maximum pressure head at the manifold towards the aim of formalizing the s0 values corresponding to cvmin s 0 c v min i e the maximum values of s0 in order to increase water distribution uniformity the derivative of

ii at the downhill end of the lateral i nd and iii for the emitter where the minimum of pressure head occurs i i min for both bmp 0 5 and 0 are graphed as function of the field slope as for the cv analysis in order to show the effects of the slope on operating pressure heads for paired drip laterals we can consider the optimal number of emitters obtained by eq 26b and eq 27b in order to refer the effect of the slope on a lateral designed for flat fields the value of the minimum dot lines and maximum dash dot lines admitted normalized pressure heads which let us detect the associated admitted slope values are also indicated the figure shows that for bmp 0 5 h n imin is in the admitted range of normalized pressure head in the downhill lateral and h n nd is in the admitted range until a maximum slope value s 0 max whereas as expected any lateral slopes greater than zero provide a normalized pressure head h n nu lower than the admitted 0 9 h n thus for paired drip laterals with bmp 0 5 on sloping fields the optimal length has to be established according to the procedure previously presented contrarily for bmp 0 for which no upstream lateral occurs fig 11b shows that laterals designed with the field assumed as flat can also be applied to sloping fields for slopes which do not overcome an s 0 max value over which pressure heads are not admitted s 0 max can be easily evaluated by putting h i d h max u and i nd into eq 1b obtaining 31a s 0 max k h n d r n d by imposing into eq 31a the optimal number of emitters corresponding to a flat field provided by eq

the importance of an adequate design of drip lateral hydraulics aimed to find the optimal length or diameter of laterals laid on sloping fields has been emphasized when designing paired laterals it is fundamental to evaluate the best manifold position bmp which usually is defined as the location of the manifold determining the same minimum pressure in uphill and downhill laterals recently by deriving simple explicit relationships as a function of 16 calibration constants baiamonte 2016a identified equal to 0 24 the best position of the manifold bmp associated with the optimal paired lateral design in sloping fields moreover the author simplified the analytical design procedure introduced by baiamonte et al 2015 to optimally design a paired drip lateral which required solving a system of four implicit equations following these main finding the most important advances in the optimal design of irrigation laterals laid on uniform slopes covered in this paper can be summarized as follows simple and monomial design relationships are derived to design laterals on uniform sloping fields that satisfies limited pressure head variations along the entire lateral δ of the emitters nominal value with δ pressure head tolerance for five considered layouts 1 manifold inside the irrigation unit for downward paired laterals 2 manifold at the edge of the irrigation unit for downward laterals 3 manifold inside the irrigation unit for flat laterals 4 manifold at the edge of the irrigation unit for flat laterals 5 manifold at the edge of the irrigation unit for upward laterals these relationships are valid for uniform laterals slope under the assumptions of neglecting i manufacturing coefficient of variation ii the variations of emitters flow rate along the lateral iii the local losses due to emitters insertions thus the procedure can be applied when the morphology of emitter connections does not produce significant reductions of the lateral cross section moreover the procedure here presented is a partial approach since it is valid only for one lateral units and cannot be used to irrigation units of branching pipe networks with many laterals and one manifold the proposed procedure reduces calibration constants of the simplified procedure of baiamonte 2016a from 16 to 3 provides much simpler relationships making evident the influence of flow rate and pipe diameter exponents in the design variables the proposed procedure extends previous design relationships to i any imposed pressure head tolerance and ii to the hazen williams resistance equation which is also widely accepted for smooth wall polyethylene pipe especially when the reynolds number exceeds 105 the proposed procedure is a good approximation of the classical step by step procedure sbs with relative errors that are only a bit greater than 2 and because of its simplicity it is also usable for the general public for an assigned slope the design procedure allows a lateral to be

11570,it is known that using paired laterals in which two distribution pipes extend in opposite directions from a common manifold contribute to increasing water use efficiency wue recently an analytical procedure to optimally design paired drip laterals on uniform slopes was proposed more recently this design procedure was simplified by deriving simple explicit relationships as a function of 16 calibration constants with relative errors that were less than 2 in this paper further simple design relationships are derived that require only 3 calibration constants thus more readily obtainable results are produced and the influence of the flow rate and diameter exponents of resistance equation are made more evident simple monomial relationships were also extended for the cases in which the lateral is laid on flat fields on upward fields and also considering layouts in which the manifold is located at the boundary instead of inside of the irrigation unit for the five considered layouts evaluations of the effects of design choices in terms of energy saving and comparisons between optimal lateral lengths are carried out finally simple linear relationships linking lateral pressure head tolerance δ coefficient of variation of pressure heads cv and emission uniformity coefficient of keller and karmeli eu are presented results showed that for any design solutions associated with the considered layouts and for δ 0 1 the proposed procedure allows optimal design of the lateral optimizing wue assuring low values of pressure head variability cv 6 1 and high values

function 1 introduction microirrigation systems saves water by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots plants either onto the soil surface or directly near the root zone through a network of valves pipes tubing and emitters it is done through narrow tubes that deliver water directly to the base of the plant thus they are considered convenient and effective means to supply water directly along individual crop rows and maintain the current levels of crop production as a consequence microirrigation can reduce water requirements and operation costs in respect to other irrigation systems keller and bliesner 1990 a lot of factors influence the diffusion of microirrigation such as the water price the cost of the equipment and the crop price some factors are related to the characteristics of the environment as the precipitation regime agnese et al 2014 and the soil hydrological characteristics which may present high spatial variability even though the same land management is assumed genius et al 2012 baiamonte et al 2017 the initial investment equipment cost which may be higher than that of traditional methods can make farmers unwilling to choose the microirrigation system however in the long term costs can be reduced through a substantial reduction in labor cost water only needs to be regulated which usually can be done via automatically timed devices costs can also be reduced by optimizing water use efficiency wue and energy saving which can be attained when the submain and lateral units are well designed so as to maximize the emitter uniformity wu et al 2010 developed a simple gravity fed drip irrigation system design procedure for low cost single manifold subunits with multiple pressure sections by assuming that the laterals are laid along elevation contours so that the ground slope along the lateral is equal to zero moreover it required iterative calculation process for determining the number of emitters per lateral and the lateral length keshtgar et al 2013 took emitter uniformity to extremes for a drip irrigation system presenting a design procedure based on variable length microtubes as emitters along the laterals thus attaining total emission uniformity however the suggested criterion might be difficult to use in practice in designing drip irrigation laterals with traditional emitters a well accepted practice consists in limiting the variation of the pressure head to about δ of its nominal value along the lateral where the pressure head tolerance δ can be assumed to be around 10 depending on each design and in particular on the accepted flow rate variability of the emitters installed along the laterals this design criterion is also considered in the manufacturers catalogues which usually provide the maximum lateral lengths for fixed nominal emitter pressure heads flow rates emitter spacing and pipe diameters for a manifold that is located at the boundary of the irrigation sector and for flat fields so that the pressure head stays in a certain admitted range of variability however in natural fields differences in elevation are usual in laterals of significant length so that the values suggested in the catalogues that manufacturers provide cannot be used without compromising the water distribution uniformity sometimes in the catalogues a note warns that the suggested lengths are subject to change due to changes in the conditions in which the tests were performed and that the lengths are valid for drip laterals laid in flat fields some companies suggest using pressure compensating emitters pce in order to overcome the effect of the slope on the lateral length of sloping fields and for very long drip laterals where the pressure at the beginning and at the end of the drip line presents considerable differences that would considerably affect the scope of the individual emitters however compared to non pressure compensating emitters such emitters are more expansive more complicated structurally and the working mechanism which causes difficulty in their research and development is not clear chu et al 2015 moreover although in the last decades pce technology was improved in the past showed contraindications madramootoo et al 1987 madramootoo 1988 and are not suggested for low pressure heads perea et al 2013 generally it is agreed that they will not last as long as non pressure compensating emitters because of the life span of the elastomer the design criterion to control pressure heads of traditional non pressure compensating emitters has been widely applied in literature also for sloping laterals it has been considered in many papers describing the basic hydraulics of drip irrigation design karmeli and keller 1975 wu and gitlin 1975 wu et al 1983 baiamonte et al 2015 baiamonte 2016a moreover disposing paired laterals so that two distribution pipes extend in opposite directions from a common manifold contributes to provide more uniform pressure to all laterals in the system increasing water use and energy efficiency of microirrigation and maximizing the lateral length al samarmad 2002 keller and bliesner 1990 stated that the best position of the manifold bmp is achieved when the same minimum pressure head in the uphill and in the downhill lateral occurs and developed graphical and numerical solution methods while previously wu et al 1983 had developed design charts allowing to determine it for horizontal paired laterals the uphill lateral length equals the downhill lateral length bmp 0 5 whereas for any other field slope the manifold has to be shifted uphill so to balance the differences in elevation and pressure losses on both laterals side kang and nishiyama 1996 used the finite element method to analyze the pressure head and discharge distribution along lateral and submain pipe the golden section search gill et al 1989 pinthong et al 2013 was applied to find the operating pressure heads of lateral and the bmp corresponding to the required uniformity of water application more recently according to the aforementioned definition of bmp provided by keller and bliesner 1990 jiang and kang 2010 used the energy gradient line approach wu 1975 wu and gitlin 1975 wu et al 1986 to derive analytical solutions to determine bmp pinthong et al 2013 developed a model to analyze the steady state hydraulics of branching pipe networks as found in on farm pressurized irrigation systems with multiple outlets at sprinklers or emitters the model used a new methodology to identify all flow paths based on a shortest path algorithm it also uses elevation obtained by high resolution topographical data and hydraulic parameters to determine which outlets are flowing and which are not an iterative solution approach resulted in the calculated flow rates and pressures at all nodes in the network with a single source node which can have a fixed head the model is based on a methodology that starts at the downstream end of a branching pipe system and works in the upstream direction to determine flow rates and pressures at each node the forward step by step sbs procedure as well known represents the most affordable method to evaluate the pressure heads and the actual flow rates that correspond to all of the emitters in the lateral however when it is applied from the uphill end to the downhill end of the lateral time consuming iterations and trials are needed to find optimal solutions al amoud 1995 kang et al 1996 kang 2000 the design process of the drip lateral can be simplified with the assumption that local losses can be neglected i e in all of the cases for which variations of flow velocity due to the emitters is limited and the morphology of emitter connections does not produce significant reductions of the lateral cross section this could be the case of flat in line coextruded drippers that are installed parallel to the pipe within the manufacturing process with relatively small profile to minimize flow disorders in the drip lateral for in line emitters characterized by an α fraction of kinetic head flow 0 3 and emitter spacing equal to 1 m local losses less than 10 of the total losses were found by provenzano and pumo 2004 under the blasius resistance equation baiamonte et al 2015 presented an analytical approach to evaluate the optimal length of paired drip laterals placed on uniformly sloped grounds by assuming that i the variations of emitters flow rate along the lateral as well as ii the local losses due to emitters insertions could be neglected although the latter assumption can be accepted only in some cases and can be fully relaxed in the exact sbs procedure which already provide complete and exact solutions the usefulness of analytical solutions is also important to consider they don t need iterations to be coded in computer programs give easy cognition of how the factors affecting the studied feature influence the output variables and serve a useful pedagogical purpose anderson and woessner 1992 giraldez and woolhiser 1996 baiamonte and singh 2016a 2016b baiamonte 2016c the analytical solution of baiamonte et al 2015 provided the maximum number of emitters in the uphill and downhill sides of the lateral and therefore to the optimal lateral length by imposing constant emitter flow rates and a pressure head tolerance δ 10 of its nominal value along the entire lateral more recently baiamonte 2016a 2016b 2018 simplified the analytical design procedure introduced by baiamonte et al 2015 which required solving a system of four implicit equations by deriving simple explicit relationships as a function of 16 calibration constants this simplified procedure derived the design variables required for the optimal paired lateral with a relative error less than 2 moreover the author identified exactly the best position of the manifold bmp associated with the optimal paired lateral design in a sloping field which resulted for flat fields equal to 0 24 whereas for complex field topography this value differs from 0 24 depending on the concavity or the convexity shape of the paired lateral baiamonte 2017a it is interesting to observe that bmp 0 24 for uniform sloped laterals and bmp 0 5 for horizontal laterals match with those derived by the extended design procedure for complex field topography in particular both bmp values are attained for particular values of the curvature parameter of the field where the lateral lays β 1 and β respectively see fig 8 of baiamonte 2017a for very irregular slopes only the sbs procedure should be used by locating the manifold at a position that results in same minimum pressure at uphill and downhill laterals in this paper for uniformly sloped paired drip laterals even simpler design relationships will be derived that only require a few constants 3 and that show the influence of the flow rate and pipe diameter exponents of the resistance equation on the design variables as the procedures previously introduced baiamonte et al 2015 baiamonte 2016a this proposed procedure is a partial approach since it is valid only for one lateral units and cannot be used to irrigation units of branching pipe networks with many laterals and one manifold on the other hand because of its simplicity it is also usable by the general public and addresses the main interest of the farmer i e the uniformity of water distribution without requiring the classic sbs hydraulic design of the irrigation system and the use of a personal computer it reproduces the results of the analytical approach introduced by baiamonte et al 2015 well with relative errors that are a bit greater than 2 and extends design relationships to i any imposed pressure head tolerance and ii to the hazen williams resistance equation which is also widely accepted for smooth wall polyethylene pipe especially when the reynolds number exceeds 105 relationships will be provided for downward paired laterals bmp 0 24 for the most common case in which the paired laterals are laid on flat fields bmp 0 5 for both corresponding layouts downward and flat in which the manifold is located at the boundary of the irrigation unit bmp 0 and finally for upward laterals for which only bmp 0 can be thus there are five considered layouts all together that are summarized in table 1 evaluations highlighting the effects of design choices in terms of energy saving which could have a certain impact by an economic point of view are discussed for the considered five layouts by neglecting manufacturing coefficient of variation comparisons between optimal lateral lengths and analyses of lateral pressure head variability and emission uniformity coefficient are carried out then for the five layouts we present and discuss applications of the proposed relationships considering different design parameters 2 the optimal paired drip lateral in a downward sloping field layout 1 and the best manifold position bmp in fig 1 for each of the considered five layouts a lateral pressure head distribution line is qualitatively illustrated table 1 reports the slope s sign negative downward the number of emitters depending on the best manifold position bmp the corresponding design equations and the average coefficient of variation of pressure head cv as illustrated in the following the optimal design of paired drip laterals on uniform slopes baiamonte et al 2015 baiamonte 2016a is moved up by the motion equations expressing pressure head variations of the i th emitter hi along the uphill side of the lateral hi u as well as along the downhill side of the lateral hi d the motion equations are valid under the assumption that we can neglect i the variations of emitters flow rate along the lateral christiansen 1942 zayani et al 2001 as well as ii the local losses due to emitters insertions so that the morphology of emitter connections does not produce significant reductions of the lateral cross section accordingly these equations are rewritten here 1a h i u s h max u s k h n u r h n u i r i s 0 1b h i d s h max u s k h n d r h n d i r i s 0 in which r denotes the flow rate

coefficient which is a function of the pipe material s characteristics baiamonte et al 2015 analytically solved the design problem of paired drip laterals in a uniformly sloping field by fixing r 1 75 and a pressure head tolerance δ 0 1 the hypothesis i to neglect the variation of emitters flow rates agrees with the latter assumption of fixing pressure head tolerance δ in fact along the lateral it is under limited pressure head variations that the ratio between the emitters flow rate variation q max qmin and its average qn is small it should be less than 10 providing a good approximation of this hypothesis wu 1997 vallesquino and luque escamilla 2002 the system of 4 equations leading to the optimal paired drip lateral design is rewritten here by generalizing for any δ and for any r i e for any exponent of the resistance equation eq 2 and by highlighting the scale role of the emitter spacing in lateral designing by mean of the normalized pressure head in respect to the emitter

it is noteworthy that for a fixed k only the discharge exponent of the resistance equation affects the system solution for r 1 75 and r 1 852 ζ 1 r is equal to 0 1336 and 0 1108 respectively for a

desired range 1 δ h n h i 1 δ h n thus the knowledge of nu and nd and the related optimal number of the emitters installed in the entire lateral nopt nu nd yielding the optimal length lopt s nopt requires the solution of the four eqs 4 7 baiamonte 2016a 2016b 2018 simplified the solution to design paired drip laterals in sloping fields by using exponential laws and power functions that approximate the analytical solution very well this solution is based on 4 calibration parameters for each unknown variable nu nd imin s0 16 calibration parameters in total to test the capability of eq

40 re were calculated by assuming that the corresponding analytical values obtained by solving the system of eqs 4 7 were true the author showed that re was less than 2 demonstrating the applicability of the proposed procedure in order to show the effect of h n on the approximated procedure fig 2 a for five values of k k 10 7 10 6 10 5 10 4 and 10 3 and under the assumption of blasius resistance equation reports the relative errors re on the estimate of n o p t as a function of h n by the procedure suggested by baiamonte 2016a the results show that relative errors rapidly diminish as h n increases for h n 3 and in any case endure within a very narrow range in the same figure the only slightly higher relative errors re for the estimate of nopt solid lines for another simpler and much more manageable design relationship presented below are also reported the optimal paired drip lateral designed according to baiamonte 2016a associated with eqs 4 7 requires a particular position of the manifold denoted as the best manifold position bmp defined as the ratio between the number of the emitters in the uphill lateral nu and the optimal number of the emitters in the entire lateral nopt by introducing approximated and explicit design relationships to derive the optimal nu and nd baiamonte 2016a showed that the bmp is slightly affected by h n and k in their usual range of variability approaching a value very close to 0 24 for r 1 75 under the blasius resistance equation eq 3a the author emphasized that bmp 0 24 is valid if the number of the uphill and downhill emitters are the optimal values so that h min u h min d 1 δ h n and h max u h max d 1 δ h n in this paper bmp will denote any other manifold position satisfying the latter condition such as the well known bmp 0 5 fig 1c for a flat lateral as well as bmp 0 if the laterals are not paired fig 1b d and e much simpler design relationships providing errors only a bit larger than those derived by baiamonte 2016a and that also require an imposed bmp can be derived by solving by substitution the eqs system 4 7 and by forcing the relationships between the design variables to follow a linear or power function described below after a little algebra for a fixed distance between the minimum pressure at the downhill lateral and its top end nd imin and for a fixed r the system of eqs 4 7 can be reduced to only two dimensionless equations for the two unknowns nu and nd 8a h n d i min r h n u r h n d i min 1 r ζ 1 r r n d i min n u 8b h n d i min 1 r ζ 1 r h n d r r n d the analytical bmp nu nu nd cannot be expressed by eqs 8a and 8b in an explicit form however for any optimal nd imin satisfying eqs 8a and 8b it can usefully be represented as a function of the number of emitters in the uphill lateral nu with the discharge exponent r of the resistance equation as a parameter as illustrated in fig 3 the considered r values in fig 3 are those of eqs 8a and 8b r 1 75 and r 1 852 and just for r 2 that corresponds to the exponent of the well known darcy weisbach formula the figure shows that for an nu greater than around 10 bmp becomes constant assuming values 0 2396 0 2478 0 2560 for r 1 75 1 871 and 2 respectively and confirms the bmp value close to 0 24 that baiamonte 2016a for r 1 75 obtained by the approximated relationships an application of eqs 8a and 8b for fixed exponent r showed that an almost linear and simpler relationship occurs between nu nd and nd imin 9a n u b 0 1 n d i min 9b n d b 0 2 n d i min in which b0 1 in b0 1 are numerical coefficients which only depend on r by combining eqs 9a and 9b the relationship between nd and nu under the condition of the optimal maximum length lateral design we can derived 10 n u b 0 1 b 0 2 n d which shows that the ratio b0 b0 1 b0 2 can be expressed as a function of the bmp according to the following relationship 11 b 0 b m p 1 b m p interestingly b0 and bmp does not depend on the pressure tolerance δ and only depends on the discharge exponent r of the pipe resistance formula according to the results illustrated in fig 3 bmp in eq 11 can reasonably be fixed as a constant rounded to two decimal places which is advisable in practice thus by fixing bmp 24 25 and 26 of the entire paired drip lateral for r 1 75 1 871 and 2 the corresponding b0 constant can be evaluated yielding b0 0 316 0 333 and 0 351 respectively therefore b0 cannot be considered a calibration parameter of the actual design procedure but simply a consequence of the choice to fix bmp the optimal number of the emitters of the paired lateral nopt can be linked to the normalized emitter pressure head h n and to the lateral slope s0 by considering the system of eq 4 7 and 10 12 n o p t n u n d b 1 δ h n s 0 in which b1 is a numerical constant that only depends on r and that will be determined by calibration therefore under the hypothesis nu 10 which is widely accepted in practice the number of the emitters of the uphill and downhill lateral nu and nd can be obtained by simply considering the imposed bmp which only slightly depends on the selected flow rate exponent of the resistance equation fig 3 13a n u b 1 b m p δ h n s 0 13b n d b 1 1 b m p δ h n s 0 once the optimal number of emitters has been derived the hydraulic and geometric characteristics of the emitters of the drip lateral have to be determined in other words for the optimal design of the lateral the relationship between the k constant expressed by eq 2 and the optimal number of the emitters of eq 13 is necessary analogously to the derivation of eq 12 an application of eqs 4 7 fit a power function 14 n o p t n u n d b 2 s 0 k 1 r in which like b0 and b1 b2 only depends on the exponent r and together with b1 will be determined by calibration thus analogously to eq 13 the number of the emitters of the uphill and downhill lateral can be obtained as a function of k 15a n u b 2 b m p s 0 k 1 r 15b n d b 2 1 b m p s 0 k 1 r finally by combing eqs 12 and 14 the relationships between the main dimensionless parameters h n and k for the verification problem k is known eq 16b as well as for the design problem h n are known eq 16a we can derive 16a k b 2 b 1 r s 0 1 r δ h n r 16b h n b 2 b 1 s 0 1 1 r δ k 1 r it is noteworthy that because of eq 16b the pressure head distribution line of the optimal paired drip lateral expressed by eq 1 only depends on the k value on the lateral slope s0 and on b1 and b2 by considering eq 2 eq 16b can be rewritten depending on the design problem of the lateral by defining i the internal pipe diameter d if qn is fixed and ii the average emitter discharge qn if d is fixed 17a d k 1 s b 1 b 2 r s q n δ h n r s s 0 1 r s 17b q n b 2 b 1 k 1 r d s r s 0 1 r r δ h n eqs 17a and 17b appear much simpler in respect to those previously derived baiamonte 2016a and better show the influence of the exponents r and s on the optimal lateral design furthermore they are monomial and their use requires only 2 calibration constants in respect to the previous 16 b1 and b2 constants were determined for a set of common values of pipe diameters flow rates pressure heads and emitter s spacing to refer to usual values of these parameters some examples of drip irrigation system manufacturer catalogues were shown tables 2 4 report the value of the maximum lengths for drip laterals laid on flat fields suggested

are available on the manufacturer s website for these design parameters k values are in the range 7 00 10 7 2 09 10 5 to extend the calibration to other design parameters which can usually be selected for sprinkler irrigation systems where higher flow rates are used the k range was extended to higher k values 10 3 10 7 for a very high number of k values 10000 in such range the optimal slope and the b1 and b2 constants were determined by satisfying the optimization procedure according to the objective functions expressed by the system 18 h n b 2 b 1 s 0 1 1 r k 1 r δ b 1 δ h n s 0 b m p 2 δ h n s

and for a certain emitter i imin in the downhill lateral the optimization procedure was carried out for blasius hazen williams and darcy weisbach resistance equation bmp 0 24 0 25 and 0 26 corresponding to b0 0 316 0 333 and 0 351 in each case the calibration gave values of the b1 and b2 variables in a very narrow range verifying the functional links expressed by eqs 12 and 14 with the variation coefficients equal to about 0 07 and 0 16 respectively the calibration provided the values b1 and b2 reported in table 5 which can be used for practical applications for the blasius hazen williams and darcy weisbach resistance equation in the following the optimal number of the emitters for the optimal paired drip lateral design according to the blasius equation r 1 75 and k 0 000779

design charts for r 1 75 relative errors re for nopt estimates associated with eqs 19 20 and 21 are graphed in fig 2b by assuming as true the corresponding analytical values obtained by solving the

corresponding ones obtained in fig 2a by using the simplified equations previously introduced baiamonte 2016a the figure shows that in respect to the latter eqs 19 20 and 21 provide errors that are only slightly larger re becomes less than 2 5 for h n 10 and decreases more and more as the normalized pressure head increases for a fixed h n re increases with k probably because of the fixed b0 bmp values as a matter of fact the increasing of re with k shown in fig 2b agrees with the differences between bmp and the fixed bmp that also increase with k as previously observed for r 1 75 baiamonte 2016a however the simplicity of the newer procedure definitely rewards the associated slightly greater re for the nopt estimate with respect to those associated with the analytical baiamonte et al 2015 or the better approximated procedure baiamonte 2016a this described procedure can be applied to both drip lateral irrigation systems as well as to sprinkler irrigation systems without diminishing its usefulness furthermore the method can be used to extend the application of the drip lateral lengths suggested by the manufacturers which generally are only valid for drip laterals laid on flat fields to drip laterals laid on sloping fields 3 application examples the choice of eqs 19 20 and 21 to use for practical application depends on the verification or design problem that has to be solved if it is a new or an already implemented irrigation system and on the knowledge of the involved parameters in the following the verification and design problems are described by assuming as is usually the case that the length of the irrigation unit i e the number of the emitters to be installed along the paired lateral nopt and the emitter spacing s are already assigned moreover because a trickle irrigations design is strongly influenced by the internal pipe diameter and there are only a few values of available internal pipe diameters the latter will be considered as assigned since nopt s and d are known in this context the verification problem conventionally denotes the case in which the emitters pressure head has to be determined whereas for the design problem the emitter pressure head is known and the flow rate has to be established in the following we apply the procedure to solve a design problem in such terms in fig 4 a by assuming the blasius equation for a pressure tolerance δ 0 1 and for a fixed diameter d 11 6 mm the optimal lateral length nopt expressed by eq 19a is graphed as a function of s0 with h n as a parameter as expected the figure shows that as the lateral slope increases the optimal emitter number decreases furthermore for a fixed slope the higher the normalized pressure head is the longer the lateral lengths are in the same figure for the same normalized pressure head values as the parameter the secondary axis shows the flow rate vs the lateral slope expressed by eq 21b interestingly the latter shows that for a fixed h n and as expected an increase in slope determines on the one hand as already observed a decrease in nopt and on the other hand an increase in flow rate the same figure also illustrates how a numerical application showing how the combined use of eqs 19a and 21b leads to the solution as example for a fixed optimal number of emitters nopt 145 and a mean lateral slope s0 13 5 corresponds a normalized pressure head h n 26 7 which can be associated to different possible pairs hn s 40 1 5 33 1 24 20 0 75 or 10 0 375 the corresponding optimal length of the lateral lopt s nopt will be 217 5 181 3 108 8 or 54 4 m depending on the selected pressure head value choosing an emitter spacing s 1 5 m and hn 40 m the optimal design of the paired drip lateral results in the flow rate qn 6 2 l h corresponding to k 9 96 10 5 lopt 217 5 m the length of the uphill lateral lu bmp nopt s 35 1 5 52 5 m and the downhill lateral ld 1 bmp lopt 165 m in fig 4b for the above mentioned parameters layout 1 by applying eq 1 i e by considering the exponent of the flow rate pressure head relationships q k hx x 0 the pressure head distribution line and the hydraulic grade line were graphed white dots and black dots respectively by using the iterative forward step by step sbs procedure starting from the manifold connection to the end of both the downhill and the uphill sides of the lateral the pressure head distribution line was also graphed by setting the exponent of the flow rate pressure head relationships x 0 5 dashed line according to previous results see baiamonte et al 2015 fig 7 and baiamonte 2016a fig 11 the figure shows that differences in pressure head distributions under the two assumptions x 0 and x 0 5 are very moderate by neglecting the manufacturing coefficient of variation cv and following sbs procedure the pressure head coefficient of variation cv and the emission uniformity coefficient eu keller and karmeli 1975 associated with the two assumptions were also calculated they resulted cv 6 25 and the obvious eu 100 for x 0 and cv 6 04 and eu 95 8 for x 0 5 thus fig 4b allows the proposed design procedure to be verified once the drip lateral length extreme pressure heads are satisfied h min u h min d 1 δ h n and h max u h max d 1 δ h n with δ 0 1 providing the maximum energy and hydraulic efficiency in the paired drip lateral design for both assumptions x 0 and x 0 5 and thus including not pressure compensating emitter in order to extend the proposed procedure to any values of the involved parameters of the optimal paired drip lateral fig 5 a charts the design problem and fig 5b charts the verification problem graphing eqs 19a and 20a with h n as a parameter and eqs 19b and 20b with k as a parameter respectively in both figures the previous numerical example is also represented for the design problem the chart application gives k 1 10 4 close to the solution that was obtained analytically whereas the verification chart application provides h n 26 7 of course for these k and h n any congruent optimal pairs for qn and d and as mentioned for hn and s can be selected to provide an optimal paired lateral in a sloping field furthermore both graphs can be used by reversing the secondary vertical axis to the main axis for example this would be useful if the maximum length of the lateral is not fixed but is instead to be determined in the next section by introducing a third last calibration constant the optimal lateral lengths are derived for the case in which the manifold is located at the top end of the drip laterals bmp 0 in a flat field s0 0 for which manufacturer catalogues already provide values and for sloping on uphill and downhill fields which are particular cases of the previous paired lateral systems 4 manifold at the top beginning of the laterals bmp 0 layout 2 4 and 5 the procedure previously described allows the optimal design of a paired drip lateral in sloping fields to be elaborated by locating the manifold according to the blasius equation at 24 of the entire optimal length of the lateral bmp 0 24 fig 1a for a fixed inlet pressure head at the manifold e g 1 1 hn it is evident that the solution bmp 0 24 provides lateral lengths greater than 24 in respect to those obtained by locating the manifold at the top end of the lateral i e by considering only the downhill lateral nu 0 also for flat terrain s0 0 for which the lengths l suggested by the manufacturer catalogue can be considered the manifold connection can be conveniently located in the center of the laterals bmp 0 5 so that for a fixed inlet pressure heads at the manifold δ hn provides doubled lengths 2 l notwithstanding the fact that the following solutions bmp 0 for flat fields as well as for sloping uphill and downhill fields layout 2 4 and 5 of table 1 are not convenient from an irrigation efficiency point of view they are described in the following because sometimes these solutions are preferred by the farmers they facilitate the underground manifold pipe s repair by making it easier to excavate since it is not located in between crop rows fig 1b d and e furthermore depending on the chosen manifold material the bmp 0 24 or bmp 0 5 requires a double number of connections of the paired drip laterals which can have an important role on the amount of costs that the farmers have to sustain 4 1 lateral laid on downward sloping fields bmp 0 nu 0 s0 0 layout 2 drip lateral design equations for downward sloping fields when the manifold is located at the boundary of the irrigation sector bmp 0 fig 1b is a particular case of the previously illustrated equations for the case nu 0 s0 0 only eqs 13b and 15b need considering giving 22a n o p t 5 58 δ h n s 0 22b n o p t 1 778 s 0 k 0 571 as for layout 1 for eq 22a or eq 22b to be applied it needs to be coupled to eqs 20 or eq 21 fig 6 a for r 1 75 for δ 0 1 for qn 5 l h and d 32 mm k 5 52 10 7 and for hn 22 5 m and s 1 5 m h n 15 illustrates the pressure head distribution for an optimal lateral designed according to eqs 22a and 21b giving nd 590 and s0 1 42 by comparing eqs 19a and 22a and by considering eq 21a it is interesting to observe for sloping laterals how much less convenient the choice bmp 0 is in respect to bmp 0 24 in particular for a fixed lateral length the emitters flow rate and slope and for any pressure head tolerance the corresponding optimal design requires the emitters pressure head and pipe diameter to be greater than 32 and 11 respectively hn 2 hn 1 d 2 d 1 in table 6 4 2 lateral laid on flat fields bmp 0 s0 0 layout 4 to detect the effect of the field slope on the optimal maximum lateral lengths for the case bmp 0 24 or 0 5 fig 1a with those obtained for the case bmp 0 fig 1d the latter needs to be formulated as it is well known in the simplest case in which the lateral laid on a level field s0 0 the minimum pressure head is located at the downstream end of the lateral i min nd nopt for any k value thus in this case the admitted minimum of the pressure head 1 δ hn needs to be imposed at the downhill end of the laterals i nd into eq 6 which considering h n d i min r 0 and s0 0 yields 23 2 δ h n k h n d r to facilitate the designing of laterals laid on flat fields a power law can be used in place of eq 23 obtaining a relationship between the main dimensionless parameters for the verification problem h n vs nopt if k

calibration constant for designing the five considered layouts table 1 in addition to b1 and b2 valid for sloped laterals eq 18 for horizontal laterals f0 was evaluated for the blasius hazen williams and darcy weisbach resistance equation giving 1 85 1 83 and 1 81 respectively for a set of design variables s0 qn d s h n fig 6b illustrates the relative error re for the estimate of the optimal number of the emitters nopt by eq 24c associated to the optimal design of a drip lateral laid on a level field s0 0 and to the blasius resistance equation as a function of nopt dashed line by assuming the analytical values obtained by eq 23 as the true re markedly diminishes with increasing nopt and becomes negligible less than 1 for nopt 30 suggesting that eq 24 is suitable for optimally designing drip laterals on flat fields the standard error estimate see associated to eq 24c is very small equal to 2 89 as fig 6b shows the relative errors re associated to eq 24c are lower than those associated to eq 19 valid for sloped laterals and bmp 0 24 very similar errors were obtained by assuming the hazen william resistance equation fig 6a illustrates an example application for the same design variables considered for layout 2 the pressure head distribution obtained by designing the drip lateral with eq 24 that for nopt 590 results in between the admitted range 0 9 hn hi 1 1 hn of course for flat fields the results can be easily extended to the case in which the manifold is located in the middle of the lateral bmp 0 5 by simply doubling the obtained optimal lengths by considering eq 24c it is interesting to observe that in respect to bmp 0 5 the choice bmp 0 is much less convenient because for fixed lateral length the emitters flow rate and pipe diameter and for any pressure head tolerance the corresponding optimal design requires the emitters pressure head to be 6 7 times greater hn 3 hn 4 in table 6 4 3 lateral laid on upward sloping fields bmp 0 nd 0 s0 0 layout 5 here we consider the design of drip lateral relationships for upward sloping fields when the manifold is located at the boundary of the irrigation sector bmp 0 fig 1e even though we know that this condition is not to be preferred we will consider it in the following because this position may be necessary if the overall structure of the irrigation system necessitates this design thus for this case nd 0 s0 0 only eqs 13a and 15a yielding 25a n o p t 1 763 δ h n s 0 25b n o p t 0 562 s 0 k 0 571 analogously to the previous cases as an application example by using the same design variables of layout 2 and 4 again fig 6a illustrates the pressure head distribution obtained by designing the drip lateral with eq 25a which with the expected smallest value nopt 186 is the best choice since it is between the admitted range 0 9 hn hi 1 1 hn the typical almost linear behavior of the pressure heads along the upward lateral is also qualitatively indicated in layout 5 of fig 1e which strongly differs from that of the corresponding downward lateral layout 2 fig 1b a comparison in respect to layout 2 can be carried out for layout 5 the choice of an upward lateral for a fixed lateral length emitters flow rate and pipe diameter and for any pressure head tolerance as expected is much less convenient because the corresponding optimal design requires the emitters pressure head and pipe diameter to be 3 2 times and 1 5 greater respectively in respect to the downward lateral see table 6 5 58 1 763 and 5 58 1 763 r 4 75 with r 1 75 5 energetic evaluations for the considered five layouts considering the increasing demand and price for energy are affecting all economic sectors including irrigated agriculture fernández garcía et al 2015 an inspection on the energetic performance of each considering layouts was in the following carried out to show and compare the energetic advantages of each of the considered layouts eqs 19 20 and 21 for layout 1 and eqs 22 24 and 25 for those corresponding to the other layouts were reformulated to derive the hn ratios for the 20 combinations of the five considered layouts 3 main hn ratio relationships were derived one for comparing both sloped lateral layouts e g hn 2 hn 1 7 35 5 58 one for a mixed comparison of sloped and horizontal laterals e g hn 4 hn 1 19 03 r 7 35 25 1 r and the last one for comparing both horizontal laterals e g hn 4 hn 3 50 25 1 r the remaining 7 hn ratios can be determined by the three mentioned relationships by substituting the design relationship coefficients of the corresponding layout with the exception of the 19 03 coefficient eq 21 b which is constant for any sloped layout 1 2 or 5 table 6 reports the hn ratios for the 20 possible combinations in the table the hn ratios corresponding to the mentioned comparisons already carried out in the previous section for bmp 0 can be observed hn 2 hn 1 1 32 hn 4 hn 3 6 7 hn 5 hn 2 3 17 values in round brackets indicate the corresponding ratio referring to the inside diameter thus from an energetic point of view the hn ratios lets us predict the economic advantages or disadvantages of each layout for example the value 1 32 1 11 under the main diagonal of the matrix as already observed indicates that for the same design variables nopt qn δ s layout 2 requires a nominal pressure head and lateral diameter 32 and 11 greater than that corresponding to layout 1 the hn ratios over the main diagonal of the matrix are of course the reciprocals of those reported under it the hn 3 hn 1 and hn 3 hn 2 ratios are noteworthy 0 89 and 0 42 respectively because they back up what it is well known in irrigation design i e bmp 0 5 in flat fields is the best efficiency choice for the manifold it is interesting to observe that by excluding the cases hn 2 hn 1 hn 5 hn 1 and hn 5 hn 2 2 for which the pipe diameters for the comparing layouts are not the same values in brackets in table 6 the remaining pressure head ratios are valid for any lateral length emitter spacing flow rate pressure head tolerance pipe material and diameter too thus it is expected that the same h ratios can be extended to the corresponding energy ratios since the latter two are linearly related with similar implications by an economic point of view finally the value hn 4 hn 3 6 7 is close to 8 that baiamonte 2017b found for the horizontal layouts for bmp 0 and for bmp 0 5 by using close form solutions of the required pressure heads derived under the darcy weisbach resistance formula 6 comparing optimal lateral lengths for sloping fields and for flat fields under the assumption of the blasius resistance equation in order to compare optimal lateral lengths for flat fields and for sloping fields as well as the two different manifold positions i e inside the irrigation sector layout 3 bmp 0 5 for flat fields fig 1c and layout 1 bmp 0 24 for sloping fields fig 1a and at the boundary of the irrigation sector layout 2 4 and 5 bmp 0 for both sloping fields fig 1b e and flat fields fig 1d the associated optimal lateral length relationships are derived below for sloping fields and bmp 0 24 by combining eqs 19a and 21 the following relationship of the optimal length l o p t s 0 0 was obtained 26a l o p t s 0 0 207 4 s h n 1 1 r δ d s 1 r q n r 1 r for b m p 0 24 l a y o u t 1 eq 26a could misrepresent the influence of the slopes on the optimal lateral length which explicitly does not figure into it in fact it must be noted that eq 26a is only valid if the lateral slopes satisfy eqs 21 which in turn must also satisfy the optimal number of the emitters expressed by eq 19b and 26a optimal lengths for a paired drip lateral laid on a flat field can be expressed by combining eq 24c and eq 2 with the k constant for r 1 75 equal to 0 000779 and by considering bmp 0 5 yielding 26b l o p t s 0 0 50 s δ 1 1 r h n 1 1 r d s 1 r q n r 1 r for b m p 0 5 layout 3 by assuming as usual δ 0 1 a comparison between eq 26a and eq 26b states that for optimal lateral laid in flat fields for which bmp 0 5 and for optimal lateral for which bmp 0 24 the associated optimal lateral lengths are very close nevertheless differences in term of hn were higher analogously to eqs 26 for the manifold located at the boundary of the irrigation sector bmp 0 fig 1b similar equations can be derived for sloping uphill and downhill fields to determine the optimal lengths of drip laterals eqs 22a and 21 have to be combined yielding 27a l o p t s 0 0 157 6 s h n 1 1 r δ d s 1 r q n r 1 r for b m p 0 layout 2 for laterals laid on flat fields with bmp 0 the optimal drip lateral length can be simply obtained by halving the optimal length expressed by eq 26b 27b l o p t s 0 0 25 s δ 1 1 r h n 1 1 r d s 1 r q n r 1 r for b m p 0 layout 4 whereas for upward sloping laterals by combining eqs 25a and 21 the corresponding optimal length l o p t s 0 0 can be obtained 27c l o p t s 0 0 4 97 s h n 1 1 r δ d s 1 r q n r 1 r for b m p 0 layout 5 it is apparent that the coefficients appearing into eqs 26 and 27 only depend on the bmp value b0 on the calibration coefficients b1 b2 f0 and on k a comparison between eqs 27a and 27b states that for bmp 0 the optimal design on a downward sloping fields provides lateral lengths that are significantly higher than those for flat fields l o p t s 0 0 1 46 l o p t s 0 0 thus manufacturer catalogues can significantly underestimate the lateral length if the slope is ignored on the contrary for uphill fields a comparison between eqs 27a and 27c yields l o p t s 0 0 0 05 l o p t s 0 0 indicating the well known great incorrectness of locating the manifold at the boundary of the irrigation unit when the fields are upwards it is noteworthy that the compared coefficients in eqs 26 0 96 and eqs 27 1 46 and 0 05 are influenced by the pressure head tolerance δ as an example they increase to 1 24 and 1 88 and 0 06 as the pressure head tolerance δ increases from 0 1 to 0 15 7 validating optimal lateral lengths for flat fields design relationships obtained for flat fields eqs 24c or 27b even if already tested by the application illustrated in fig 6a solid line can be used as a verification via a comparison with the lateral lengths l suggested by the manufacturers table 2 4 since the same hypotheses are valid s0 0 and bmp 0 fig 7 reports the number of emitters suggested by the catalogues in abscissa computed as l s for three different manufacturers a b and c and the corresponding number of the optimal emitters in ordinate calculated by eq 27b by assuming δ 0 1 and n o p t l o p t s 0 0 s it can be observed that for the manufacturers a and b only a few pairs are far from the line of perfect agreement this is probably due to the fact that as the catalogue says the suggested lengths are subject to change due to changes in the conditions in which the tests were performed or because the considered resistance equation in the catalogue is different from the well accepted blasius equation considered here thus for manufacturers a and b the pairs are almost next to the line of perfect agreement whereas for the manufacturer c eq 27b underestimates the number of the emitters however this discrepancy must be due to the fact that as reported in the catalogue the lateral length suggested by the manufacturer does not agree with the optimal design criteria assumed in all of the proposed design relationships which should be preferred to fix at the last emitter the most disadvantaged in flat fields to assure a pressure head equal to δ hn as a matter of fact see table 4 footnote a pressure head equal to 0 7 bar is assumed independently of the nominal pressure head of the emitter in other words the last emitter for the suggested length operates as an example for a nominal pressure head pn 4 bar according to eq 27b it could operate with a pressure near to the nominal one pe 0 9 hn 0 9 4 3 6 bar whereas according to the catalogue it should operate with a pressure head much lower than the nominal one pe 0 7 bar thus drip lateral lengths suggested in the catalogue are greater than those corresponding to the suggested design relationships to the detriment of flow rate uniformity 8 analysis of lateral pressure head variability cv and emission uniformity coefficient eu for the considered five layouts interesting analysis and discussion about the coefficient of variation of water distribution and emission uniformity were carried out by royuela tomás et al 2005 and juana et al 2004 who provided analytical solutions in this section under the assumption of the mentioned hypothesis and for the selected five layouts relationships to determine the pressure head coefficient of variation cv and emission uniformity coefficient according to keller and karmeli 1975 are derived as observed because of eq 20b for sloping laterals and eq 24a for horizontal laterals the pressure head distribution of the optimal lateral only depends on the k parameter and on the slope value s0 by neglecting manufacturing coefficient of variation for the k values ranging between 10 3 10 7 pressure head uniformity has been investigated by considering the drip laterals of the five layouts reported in table 1 by considering eq 1 the coefficient of variation cv was calculated for each layout and for each k value according to the derived relationship 28a c v n u n d i 1 n u 1 δ h n k h n u r h n u i r i s 0 2 i 1 n d 1 δ h n k h n d r h n d i r i s 0 2 i 1 n u 1 δ h n k h n u r h n u i r i s 0 i 1 n d 1 δ h n k h n d r h n d i r i s 0 2 1 in which h n is expressed according to eq 20b for sloped laterals or to eq 24a for horizontal laterals for layout 3 for which bmp 0 5 nu nd and s0 0 and for layouts 2 4 and 5 for which bmp 0 nu 0 or nd 0 eq 28a reduces to 28b c v n i 1 n 1 δ h n k h n r h n i r i s 0 2 i 1 n 1 δ h n k h n r h n i r i s 0 2 1 where n nu or nd depending on the layout and whether the sign of s0 is or depending on whether the field is downhill or uphill respectively for layout 1 downward sloping laterals for a fixed k value k 10 3 10 4 and 10 5 and for different pressure head tolerances δ 0 1 0 07 0 05 and 0 03 fig 8 illustrates cv as a function of s0 for the highest k value fig 8a cv seems to vary with s0 variability over a constant cv value tends to vanish with a decreasing k until it completely disappears for the lowest k value long laterals fig 8c this cv behavior can be justified for the low k values for which for any δ the number of the emitters especially in the uphill side can be low e g 10 15 as can be observed by eq 14 and eqs 15 in fact for a low number of emitters the calibrated parameters may not result in the working range see fig 3 pushing the lateral farther from the optimal operating pressure head range some dispersion over the constant cv value can also be justified by the necessary rounding to the integer in applying eq 28 table 1 reports the mean value cv for 3 values of the pressure head tolerance δ 0 1 0 07 and 0 03 which as expected increases with δ and varies in a very narrow range as illustrated in fig 9 a cv and δ are linearly correlated the angular coefficients mcv also reported in the figure can be used to set the desired cv value in designing optimal laterals once the corresponding pressure head tolerance δ is calculated by the equation indicated in the figure analogously to cv also the familiar design emission uniformity coefficient eu of keller and karmeli 1975 commonly used for the evaluation of the performance of drip irrigation systems associated with the proposed procedure was derived baiamonte 2016b 29a e u 100 1 1 27 c v n p n u n d 1 δ h n i 1 n u 1 δ h n k h n u r h n u i r i s 0 i 1 n d 1 δ h n k h n d r h n d i r i s 0 x where x is the exponent of the flow rate pressure head relationships np are the number of emitters per plant cv is the manufacturing coefficient of variation q min and qav are the minimum and the average emitter flow rates in the lateral for layouts 2 3 4 and 5 eq 29a reduces to 29b e u 100 1 1 27 c v n p n 1 δ h n i 1 n 1 δ h n k h n r h n i r i s 0 x where n refers to the total number of the emitters of the lateral and the sign of s0 is or depending on whether the field is downhill or uphill respectively by neglecting the manufacturing coefficient of variation cv eq 29a and eq 29b are illustrated in fig 9b which shows a linear relationship between eu and δ also indicated in the figure together with the corresponding angular coefficient meu as for cv fig 9b the latter can be used to determine the laterals pressure head tolerance of the δ corresponding to a desired eu value the figure shows that as expected with increasing of δ cv increases whereas eu decreases moreover layout 1 and 2 downward sloped fields and layout 3 and 4 horizontal fields have the same behavior in terms of cv and eu for any layout it is also interesting to observe that the design procedure allows a lateral to be designed with the maximum length optimizing water use efficiency wue assuring low values of pressure head variability cv 6 1 for δ 0 1 and high values of emission uniformity eu 95 for δ 0 1 interestingly cv and eu values corresponding to layout 1 inversely derived by the relationships indicated in fig 9ab for δ 0 1 match with those calculated for the example of the application illustrated in fig 4b where the exact sbs procedure was applied cv 6 2 and eu 96 0 the latter showed that the considered assumption x 0 also in computing the average for cv eq 28 and for eu eq 29 and the standard deviation for cv eq 28 of emitters pressure heads provide satisfactory results further investigations are carried out below which aim to detect variations of cv as a function of the slope for laterals designed according to the proposed procedure under the assumption that the lateral is laid on a flat field for bmp 0 5 and for bmp 0 in respect to fig 8 the role of the slope is different in fig 8 the slope corresponds to the optimal design whereas it varies in the actual context for r 1 75 δ 0 1 and for two values of k 7 10 7 and 8 10 6 and h n 10 and 120 fig 10 illustrates the coefficient of variation cv as a function of the field slope for bmp 0 5 fig 10a and for bmp 0 fig 10b in both cases the number of the emitters is the optimal 2 nd and nd calculated by eq 24c for s0 0 for both bmp values layout 3 and 4 as reported in table 1 fig 10 shows that for s0 0 cv 5 9 moreover depending on the bmp value it is interesting to observe a different effect of the lateral slope on cv for bmp 0 5 for any h n and k values because of the minimum admitted pressure head at the two extreme ends of the lateral 0 9 hn cv monotonically increases with the lateral slope in fact any s0 0 values shows a decrease at the top end pressure head of the lateral hi u 0 9 hn and an increasing pressure head at the bottom end of the lateral hi d 1 1 hn contrarily for bmp 0 in a certain low range of s0 cv decreases with increasing s0 showing a minimum cv value cvmin equal to 2 over which cv as for bmp 0 5 increases with s0 this cv behavior appears reasonable if one considers that as the slope increases from s0 0 cv reductions are determined by the increasing of the pressure head at the top end of the lateral starting from 0 9 hn also imposed for s0 0 because of the imposed maximum pressure

ii at the downhill end of the lateral i nd and iii for the emitter where the minimum of pressure head occurs i i min for both bmp 0 5 and 0 are graphed as function of the field slope as for the cv analysis in order to show the effects of the slope on operating pressure heads for paired drip laterals we can consider the optimal number of emitters obtained by eq 26b and eq 27b in order to refer the effect of the slope on a lateral designed for flat fields the value of the minimum dot lines and maximum dash dot lines admitted normalized pressure heads which let us detect the associated admitted slope values are also indicated the figure shows that for bmp 0 5 h n imin is in the admitted range of normalized pressure head in the downhill lateral and h n nd is in the admitted range until a maximum slope value s 0 max whereas as expected any lateral slopes greater than zero provide a normalized pressure head h n nu lower than the admitted 0 9 h n thus for paired drip laterals with bmp 0 5 on sloping fields the optimal length has to be established according to the procedure previously presented contrarily for bmp 0 for which no upstream lateral occurs fig 11b shows that laterals designed with the field assumed as flat can also be applied to sloping fields for slopes which do not overcome an s 0 max value over which pressure heads are not admitted s 0 max can be

the importance of an adequate design of drip lateral hydraulics aimed to find the optimal length or diameter of laterals laid on sloping fields has been emphasized when designing paired laterals it is fundamental to evaluate the best manifold position bmp which usually is defined as the location of the manifold determining the same minimum pressure in uphill and downhill laterals recently by deriving simple explicit relationships as a function of 16 calibration constants baiamonte 2016a identified equal to 0 24 the best position of the manifold bmp associated with the optimal paired lateral design in sloping fields moreover the author simplified the analytical design procedure introduced by baiamonte et al 2015 to optimally design a paired drip lateral which required solving a system of four implicit equations following these main finding the most important advances in the optimal design of irrigation laterals laid on uniform slopes covered in this paper can be summarized as follows simple and monomial design relationships are derived to design laterals on uniform sloping fields that satisfies limited pressure head variations along the entire lateral δ of the emitters nominal value with δ pressure head tolerance for five considered layouts 1 manifold inside the irrigation unit for downward paired laterals 2 manifold at the edge of the irrigation unit for downward laterals 3 manifold inside the irrigation unit for flat laterals 4 manifold at the edge of the irrigation unit for flat laterals 5 manifold at the edge of the irrigation unit for upward laterals these relationships are valid for uniform laterals slope under the assumptions of neglecting i manufacturing coefficient of variation ii the variations of emitters flow rate along the lateral iii the local losses due to emitters insertions thus the procedure can be applied when the morphology of emitter connections does not produce significant reductions of the lateral cross section moreover the procedure here presented is a partial approach since it is valid only for one lateral units and cannot be used to irrigation units of branching pipe networks with many laterals and one manifold the proposed procedure reduces calibration constants of the simplified procedure of baiamonte 2016a from 16 to 3 provides much simpler relationships making evident the influence of flow rate and pipe diameter exponents in the design variables the proposed procedure extends previous design relationships to i any imposed pressure head tolerance and ii to the hazen williams resistance equation which is also widely accepted for smooth wall polyethylene pipe especially when the reynolds number exceeds 105 the proposed procedure is a good approximation of the classical step by step procedure sbs with relative errors that are only a bit greater than 2 and because of its simplicity it is also usable for the general public for an assigned slope the design procedure allows a lateral to be designed with the maximum length optimizing water use efficiency wue assuring low values of pressure head variability cv 6 1 for δ 0 1 and high values of emission uniformity eu 95 for δ 0 1 for layout 4 manifold at the edge of the irrigation unit for flat laterals a positive comparison with lateral lengths suggested in 3 manufacture s catalogues is carried out for each considered layout relationships between the pressure head tolerance the variation coefficient of pressure head along the lateral and the emission uniformity coefficient of keller and karmeli are presented evaluations highlighting the effects of design choices in terms of energy saving comparisons between optimal lateral lengths for the five layouts and analysis of lateral pressure heads variability are carried out as an example for the most common case of flat fields results showed that compared to the case in which the manifold is at the boundary of the irrigation unit bmp 0 the manifold located in the middle bmp 0 5 requires an emitters pressure head that is 6 7 times lower acknowledgments research was supported by prin 2015 project granted by miur italian ministry for university and research no

rotations of european open field vegetable crops outputs of eu rotate n include crop growth fruit yield crop n uptake crop evapotranspiration etc drainage and nitrate no3 leaching rahn et al 2010 additionally eu rotate n calculates soil mineral n and water dynamics n mineralization from organic material various soil n transformations and root development rahn et al 2010 the model has been used as i a tool to assess effects of different fertilizer and rotation practices on n losses to the environment and gross margin returns and ii as a decision support system for improving n management to reduce n losses while maintaining yield the eu rotate n model has been used across a wide range of crop growing conditions such as open field crops in northern europe and the mediterranean region de waele et al 2017 doltra and muñoz 2010 nendel et al 2012 rahn et al 2010 and in greenhouses in china guo et al 2010 sun et al 2012 eu rotate n is a versatile simulation model of both agronomic e g

different irrigation systems with conventional split fertilizer applications or fertigation and can be used with crop sequences rahn et al 2010 the eu rotate n model is unique for the number of vegetable species for which default calibrations are provided thompson et al 2017 most simulation models for vegetable crops are specific to a single species thompson et al 2017 a number of studies have evaluated the performance of eu rotate n for simulation of i agronomic parameters such as dry matter production marketable yield or crop n uptake and ii trends of soil water and mineral n content by comparing simulated with experimentally measured values doltra et al 2010 guo et al 2010 nendel et al 2012 rahn et al 2010 in most of these evaluations the default calibration values provided by eu rotate n for each species were used doltra and muñoz 2010 guo et al 2010 nendel et al 2012 rahn et al 2010 rather than determining calibration values for the crops and systems being examined in most of the studies where no3 leaching and drainage were simulated the simulated values of no3 leaching and drainage were not compared to experimentally measured values de waele et al 2017 doltra and muñoz 2010 guo et al 2010 with the exception of the study with tomato by soto et al 2014 there are no published studies with eu rotate n that have compared simulated to measured values of etc drainage and no3 leaching this is surprising given that simulation with eu rotate n is commonly used to determine the impact of crop management on no3 leaching e g de waele et al 2017 doltra and muñoz 2010 guo et

greenhouses in the world castilla and hernández 2005 nitrate leaching and drainage are important issues with this vegetable production system there is substantial no3 contamination of underlying aquifers and a rising water table caused by drainage returns to a shallow aquifer that risks flooding low lying areas pulido bosch et al 1997 pulido bosch 2005 due to no3 contamination of underlying aquifers most of the areas where the greenhouses are located have been declared nitrate vulnerable zones in accordance with the european union nitrate directive anon 1991 which requires the adoption of improved management practices in se spain many greenhouse vegetable growers cultivate two crops per cropping season a common cropping sequence is a spring melon crop grown from february march until june july followed by an autumn winter sweet pepper crop from july to late december february during the period between crops in the summer additional irrigations involving large volumes of water are applied i to leach salts ii for soil disinfection and iii to moisten the soil profile immediately prior to transplanting the following crop thompson et al 2007 results of a survey conducted by thompson et al 2007 showed that salt leaching irrigations with volumes 20 mm and 40 mm were applied in respectively 69 and 42 of greenhouses and that volumes of water of 20 were applied in 78 of greenhouses for soil disinfection drainage associated with the large irrigations used for salt leaching soil disinfection and for moistening the soil profile is likely to be an important contributing factor to aquifer no3 contamination thompson et al 2007 analysis of the environmental impact of this system in relation to no3 leaching loss should consider cropping sequences including the management of bare soil between crops the eu rotate n model is uniquely suited to simulate and examine such sequences the mains objectives of this work were to evaluate the capacity of the eu rotate n model to simulate a agronomic variables dry matter production marketable fruit yield crop n uptake etc dynamics of soil water content swc and b variables associated to no3 pollution drainage and no3 leaching accumulation of soil mineral n in sequences of melon bare soil pepper for soil grown crops in plastic mediterranean greenhouses an additional objective was to evaluate the effect of calibration of various parameters on the accuracy of the model compared to the use of default calibration values 2 materials and methods 2 1 location and cropping details the crops were grown in two plastic greenhouses at the research station of the cajamar foundation located in el ejido in the province of almeria southeastern se spain 2 43 w 36 48 n and 151 m elevation the growing conditions were similar to those of commercial vegetable production on the se coast of spain this vegetable production system is described by castilla and hernández 2005 castilla 2013 thompson et al 2007 and valera et al 2016 the two greenhouses were identical and were adjacent to one another along their east west axis each greenhouse was 24 m long by 18 m wide they were unheated passively ventilated and had an east west orientation the greenhouse cladding was low density polyethylene tri laminated film crops were grown in an artificial layered soil typical of the region castilla 2013 thompson et al 2007 which was formed by placing a 30 cm layer of clay soil imported from a quarry over the original loam soil a 10 cm layer of coarse river gravel with a particle size distribution of 9 62 and 29 for 0 05

mixed into the top layer of the imported soil following local practices of periodic manure application thompson et al 2007 the gravel layer was temporarily removed when the manure was added relevant details of the soil are given in table 1 surface drip irrigation was used with 1 m spacing between drip emitter lines and 0 5 m between emitters within emitter lines the drip emitters had a discharge rate of 2 8 l h 1 the irrigation water had an electrical conductivity of 0 4 ds m 1 complete nutrient solutions were applied by fertigation through the drip irrigation system in all irrigations during the crops two cropping sequences of galia type muskmelon cucumis melo l cv deneb and california sweet pepper crops capsicum annum l cv vergasa were grown in succession between 2005 and 2007 the dates of transplanting and end of each crop are given in table 2 irrigations associated with chemical soil disinfection and salt leaching in the period between the two crops of a given sequence were considered as part of that sequence table 2 in all crops six week old seedlings were transplanted with a planting density of 2 plants m 2 with one plant adjacent to a drip emitter melon was planted in equidistant single parallel lines with all plants on the same side of its associated emitter pepper was planted in paired parallel lines by placing seedlings on the inside of each of a pair of emitter lines plants were vertically supported by nylon cords all aspects of crop management apart from irrigation and n application i e training of crops prunings pest management etc in all crop and treatments followed established local practice climatic conditions during crop growth were similar to those reported by fernández et al 2010 when determining long term climate inside plastic greenhouses in this region averaged for each month daily maximum and minimum temperatures were respectively 21 37 c and 7 21 c daily integral values of solar radiation were 6 17 mj m 2 d 1 and the daily average vapor pressure deficit vpd was 0 7 2 0 kpa during warmer periods of the pepper crops whitewash suspension of calcium carbonate was applied to the greenhouse roof to reduce the temperature inside the greenhouse 2 2 irrigation and n treatments for each sequence and crop two treatments of combined irrigation and n management were applied in each greenhouse in one greenhouse conventional management cm of n and irrigation was used in the other greenhouse improved management im of both n and irrigation was used the cm and im treatments are referred here to as cm 2005 im 2005 for the crops in 2005 and cm 2006 and im 2006 for the crops during 2006 a detailed description of the management of n and irrigation in the 2006 sequence is presented in granados et al 2013 irrigation treatments were applied in three stages i a pre transplant irrigation ii during the three week period of plantlet establishment and iii from crop establishment to the end of the crop in the cm treatments of all crops the volumes of pre transplant irrigations and both the volumes and frequency of irrigation during the plantlet establishment period followed the recommendations of local technical advisors in each cm crop a single pre transplant irrigation was applied the day before transplanting from the end of the plantlet establishment period until the end of the crop irrigation volumes were determined by multiplying historical values of etc bonachela et al 2006 by values of relative irrigation supply ris previously determined for different periods of the cropping cycle for each species in a survey of commercial irrigation practice in the region fernández et al 2007 the n concentrations in the applied nutrient solutions in the cm melon and pepper crops followed established local management practices in both years which were determined in consultation with local technical advisers the average n concentration of the nutrient solution was approximately 12 mmol l 1 table 2 the improved management im practices consisted of prescriptive corrective management granados et al 2013 using simulation models to estimate crop water and n requirements and soil monitoring approaches to make adjustments to ensure optimal management in the im managed greenhouse pre transplant irrigations consisted of a series of small irrigations of 1 2 mm at 1 2 day intervals to ensure that matric potential was 10 to 15 kpa during the period of plantlet establishment irrigation was applied to maintain matric potential between 5 and 10 kpa after crop establishment irrigation volumes for im treatments were based on estimated historical etc bonachela et al 2006 and were adjusted to ensure that the soil matric potential remained within the range of 10 to 30 kpa in the im 2005 melon crop the n concentration applied was the same as for the cm in im 2005 pepper there was a targeted reduction of 40 in the n concentration of the applied solution after crop establishment in the 2006 im crops n management was based on simulating crop n requirements with subsequent adjustment being made to maintain soil solution no3 concentration at 8 12 mmol l 1 granados et al 2013 approximately 95 of added n was no3 the remainder was ammonium nh4 which is consistent with local practice the total amounts of irrigation n applied and the average applied n concentrations are presented in table 2 chemical soil disinfection was conducted between crops by applying metham potassium in irrigations of 24 mm on 26 june 2005 and of 20 mm on 1 july 2005 in 2006 irrigations associated to soil disinfection with metham postassium were 21 and 18 mm applied on 8 and 15 june 2006 respectively all irrigations associated with chemical soil disinfection were applied through the drip system no nutrients were applied in these irrigations the volumes applied in the disinfection irrigations were the same for the two treatments two irrigations of 49 mm and 44 mm were applied on 14 and 15 july 2005 in both greenhouses to leach accumulated salts the pre transplanting irrigations referred to previously were considered as part of soil management in the period between crops additional irrigations were applied during the between crop period to clean the drip system using acid and to assess application uniformity 2 3 measurements all measurements of crop and soil parameters from each greenhouse were made with four replicates different zones of each greenhouse were sampled to ensure that the replicates represented the entire greenhouse air dry t and wet bulb temperatures were measured in both greenhouses at a height of 2 m using aspirated psychrometers priva nutricontrol veghel the netherlands data were measured and recorded every 5 min relative humidity rh and vapor pressure deficit vpd were calculated from these data solar radiation inside the greenhouses was measured using a pyranometer model sks1110 skye instruments llandrindod wells wales united

were very similar in both greenhouses data were averaged from both greenhouses irrigation volumes of nutrient solution for each greenhouse were measured daily with water meters model arad m 15 zenner saarbrucken germany each week two replicate samples of irrigation were collected for determination of concentrations of no3 and nh4 drainage was collected daily using two replicate free draining re packed lysimeters 4 m long 2 m wide 0 7 m deep located in the southern side of each greenhouse the bottom and walls of the lysimeters were lined with butyl rubber the soil profile in the lysimeter reproduced that of the outside area described above to a depth of 0 6 m with a layer of gravel placed between the butyl rubber sheet and the layered soil the lysimeters are described in detail by bonachela et al 2006 representative sub samples of the lysimeter drainage solutions were collected daily and analyzed for concentrations of no3 and nh4 the daily amount of no3 leached was calculated from drainage volume drainage no3 concentration and the 8 m2 surface area of the lysimeters amounts of nh4 leached were negligible the no3 and nh4 concentrations in applied nutrient solutions and in drainage were analyzed with an automatic continuous segmented flow analyzer model san skalar analytical b v breda the netherlands crop evapotranspiration was measured weekly using the water balance approach based on measurements of the change in measured volumetric soil water content swc between weekly periods and the total volume of applied irrigation and drainage collected for the weekly period under consideration the swc data were measured with capacitance sensors cs model rt6 sentek sensor technologies south australia australia and recorded at 30 min intervals for the 0 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 30 cm soil depths relative to the surface of the imported soil in the lysimeters with two sensors in each of the two lysimeters in each greenhouse the value of swc at 6 am for 0 30 cm soil was used for the water balance a calibration of the cs sensors was made for each layer of the experimental soil before installation each cs was normalized with air and with a representative nutrient solution as applied to the cm managed crops soil was sampled and analyzed for mineral n no3 and nh4 and gravimetric soil water content immediately before mid way through and at the end of each crop soil was sampled in two 30 cm depth increments to 60 cm depth for each soil sampling soil was sampled in four replicate locations in each greenhouse treatment and in each location there were three sampling positions 1 5 cm from and perpendicular to the drip emitter 2 mid way between emitters within the same emitter line and 5 cm from the drip line and 3 mid way between adjacent crop and drip lines parallel with drippers each depth increment from each sampling position within each replicate location was treated as a separate sample the mineral n content of the soil was determined following extraction by potassium chloride kcl 40 g moist soil 200 ml 2 m kcl concentrations of no3 and nh4 in the soil extracts were determined using the automatic segmented flow analyzer described previously for the analysis of nutrient solutions and drainage with respect to the sampling positions soil mineral n and soil water content was calculated as 0 25 x position 1 0 25 x position 2 0 50 x position 3 measurements of dry matter production dmp were made during each cropping season by sampling two entire plants from the four different replicate zones of each greenhouse the amount of dry matter of leaves stems and fruit was determined by weighing all fresh material of each component and the percentage of dry matter content was determined by oven drying representative samples at 65 c until constant weight additionally four replicate areas of 4 m2 in each greenhouse each with eight plants were marked to determine the mass of dry matter of all pruned material removed during the season and of total fruit production at each pruning the amounts of dry matter removed were determined during the fruit production phase mature fruit was collected from the marked plants and fresh and dry weights were determined for each biomass sampling date the total dmp was calculated as the sum of dry matter of plant biomass for that sampling date and of both total pruned material and harvested fruit up to that date at the end of the crop the eight marked plants previously used for following pruning and fruit production were harvested and the final dmp was calculated as the sum of the dry matter at the final plant sampling the dry matter of all pruned material and the dry matter of total fruit production from each sampling of biomass pruning or fruit harvest representative individual samples of leaves stems and fruits were ground separately first with a knife mill model sm100 comfort retsch haan germany and then with a ball mill model mm200 retsch haan germany and the total n content was determined using a dumas type elemental analyzer system model ea 3000 eurovector s p a milan italy crop n uptake was determined for each sampling date from measurements of dry matter and n content for each replicate for that date crop n uptake was above ground n uptake it was assumed that root n uptake was relatively very small in a fertigated drip irrigated system with very frequent small n applications 2 4 the eu rotate n simulation model model settings inputs and calibration eu rotate n is a simulation model developed to be a decision support system for n management in vegetable crop rotations throughout europe a detailed description of the model was published by rahn et al 2010 eu rotate n simulates crop growth and the n and water dynamics in the soil plant system on a daily basis in the current work version 1 8 2009 was used simulations were conducted for sequences of melon bare soil pepper table 2 daily values of daily maximum and minimum temperature and relative humidity wind speed daily sum of solar radiation and reference evapotranspiration eto were the input data for the meteorological data file required to run the model rainfall was always set to zero since wind speed is almost negligible inside greenhouses in this region a constant average daily value of 0 1 m s 1 was used fernández et al 2010 reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated using the penman monteith equation adapted for mediterranean type plastic greenhouses with a fixed aerodynamic resistance of 295 s cm 1 fernández et al 2010 2011 and was introduced as an input in the meteorological data file greenhouse data of crop management and soil properties were entered as inputs into the model the soil profile was modelled as being six consecutive 10 cm deep layers the surface layer of gravel was not considered to be part of the soil profile because of its negligible capacity for retaining water and nutrients relevant properties of each soil depth are presented in table 1 for each simulation initial model input values of soil water content and soil mineral n table 2 were those measured at the beginning of each treatment the drainage coefficient for each soil layer table 1 was calculated as described by doltra and muñoz 2010 n fertilizer applications were entered into the model as occurring in all individual irrigations as irrigations with specified n concentrations g l 1 for the fraction of soil area wetted by irrigation a value of 0 5 was used for all treatments the target dry matter value in the input file table 2 was the measured final total dry matter produced during the crop it was assumed that there was only one fruit harvest at the end of each crop which was the sum of the periodic fruit harvests previous work with pepper in this greenhouse system demonstrated significant errors in the simulation of dmp with eu rotate n when multiple fruit harvests were considered in the input file gallardo et al 2011 simulations using the default calibration parameters for melon and pepper provided in the data base of the model were conducted for the cm 2006 melon bare soil pepper sequence table 3 the outputs from these simulations using the default calibration parameters were compared with experimental data the eu rotate n model was calibrated for greenhouse grown melon and pepper crops using data from the cm 2006 melon and pepper crops that were representative of local practices this calibration is hereafter referred to as the greenhouse calibration the parameters determined for the greenhouse calibration were those related to crop growth crop n uptake etc and marketable yield table 3 base temperatures of 12 and 10 c were used for melon and pepper respectively fernández et al 2001 the lag period before root growth begins ddglag was assumed to be 0 c day 1 considering that the crop was transplanted with 4 5 leaves and growing conditions were favorable for immediate establishment the coefficients a and b of the exponential equation to calculate the critical n the minimum n content in the crop required for maximum dry matter production of the critical n curve rahn et al 2010 were obtained for melon from previous work gallardo et al 2011 in pepper the default values of the model were used for the critical n curve the empirical coefficients for the direct conversion algorithms for the calculation of fruit yield from plant dry matter production rahn et al 2010 were obtained from the calibration crops the maximum crop height was increased to 3 0 m for melon and to 1 5 m for pepper to adapt to the taller height of the greenhouse grown crops which were supported with nylon cords table 3 crop evapotranspiration etc was calculated by eu rotate n using the fao approach with dual crop coefficient values allen et al 1998 the three basal crop coefficients kcb and the length of the four crop growth stages were adjusted until the differences between simulated and measured values of etc in the calibration crops were minimized since the 2006 melon was planted one month earlier than the 2005 melon the lengths of the growth stages and the kcb values were additionally determined for the 2005 melon crop using the cm 2005 treatment table 3 for the rest of crop parameters the default values for melon and pepper in the crop data base of eu rotate n version 1 8 were used to consider the effect of reduced evaporation from the soil surface due to the mulching effect of the superficial gravel layer the parameters determining soil evaporation were adjusted these parameters were i readily evaporable water rew and ii the thickness of the evaporation layer ze different scenarios were compared in the cm 2006 pepper crop to obtain the values that minimized soil evaporation and reduced the differences between simulated and measured etc during the season the selected values were rew of 0 2 and ze of 0 01 in the four cropping sequences examined the eu rotate n model was used to simulate the entire complete sequence of melon bare soil pepper in these simulations the greenhouse calibration parameters and the adjusted soil evaporation coefficients were always used 2 5 model performance evaluation eu rotate n was validated by comparing simulated seasonal values that used the greenhouse calibration parameters to measured seasonal values of i above ground dry matter production ii crop n uptake iii etc iv drainage and no3 leaching from 0 to 60 cm of soil and iv soil water content in the 0 30 and 30 60 cm and v soil mineral n in the 0 30 and 0 60 cm soil layers experimental data from the cm 2005 and im 2005 sequences and from the im 2006 sequence were used for validation table 2 the following statistical indices were used following willmott 1982 to evaluate the agreement of simulated with measured values 1 the root mean square error rmse calculated as r m s e i 1 n p i o i n where n is the number of cases pi and oi are the ith predicted simulated and observed measured values the rmse reflects the differences between simulated and measured values and the units are the same as the units of the observed values the lower limit of rmse is 0 indicating perfect agreement between simulated and measured values 2 the relative error re r e r m s e o where o is the mean of the measured data the re is similar to a coefficient of variation since it relates the error rmse between simulated and measured value to the measured average the lower limit of re is 0 indicating perfect agreement between simulated and measured values 3 the willmott 1982 index of agreement d where and the letters p and o were previously defined the index of agreement d is a descriptive measure of the relative size of the differences between simulated and measured values and is useful to compare the performance of different models willmott 1982 values of the index of agreement range from 0 to 1 where a value of 1 indicates perfect agreement 4 linear regression analysis forced through zero between simulated y variable and measured x variable values that were compared to the 1 1 line for statistically significant differences p 0 05 in slope and intercept values the slope m and the coefficient of determination r2 of the regression equation were considered in addition to agreement with the 1 1 line 3 results 3 1 influence of the calibration of the main crop parameters on eu rotate n simulation simulated values using both the default and the greenhouse calibration parameters and measured values of several output variables for the cm 2006 melon bare soil pepper sequence are presented in fig 1 for these output variables apart from seasonal dmp in both crops fig 1a and seasonal crop n uptake in pepper 2006 fig 1b the greenhouse calibration considerably improved the accuracy of the simulation compared to the default calibration using the default calibration the model was poor at simulating seasonal crop n uptake in melon 2006 fig 1b and overestimated seasonal etc particularly so in melon 2006 fig 1c in both crops the use of the greenhouse calibration of etc and the adjustment of the soil evaporation coefficients enabled a better adjustment between simulated and measured values of etc particularly in the early part of the growing season of the crops fig 1c the statistical indices for each output variable when using the default and greenhouse calibrations for simulations of the cm 2006 sequence are presented in table 4 the greenhouse calibration considerably improved the performance of the model appreciably reducing the errors associated with the default calibration which were more apparent in melon than in pepper table 4 in melon using the greenhouse compared to the default calibration reduced re by 65 76 and 89 for seasonal dmp crop n uptake and etc respectively in pepper the reduction in re achieved by the greenhouse calibration compared to default calibration was 30 for both seasonal dmp and seasonal crop n uptake and 82 for etc

drainage seasonal no3 leaching and of soil water and soil mineral n dynamics which were not directly calibrated in this study but were indirectly affected by calibration were considerably improved by the greenhouse calibration fig 1 the calibration of etc resulted in a large improvement in the simulation of drainage during both the melon and pepper crops prior to the greenhouse calibration drainage was considerably underestimated by the model and was associated with large errors fig 1d table 4 similar to drainage simulation of no3 leaching was underestimated when calibrated using default values during the melon crop and in the initial part of the pepper and was overestimated during the bare soil period between crops fig 1e after greenhouse calibration the agreement between simulated and measured values of no3 leaching improved in melon and during the period of bare soil but did not improve in the pepper crop simulated soil water content was much lower than that of measured values using the default calibration and was very close to measured values when the greenhouse calibration was used fig 1f soil mineral n was appreciably overestimated by the model using the default calibration but like the soil water content was close to measured values when the greenhouse calibration was used fig 1g all errors associated with the statistical evaluation of the model were considerably reduced with the greenhouse calibration table 4 3 2 simulation of dry matter n uptake evapotranspiration and yield simulated values of seasonal dmp crop n uptake and etc are plotted against measured values for pooled data through the cropping season for the three validation crops cm 2005 im 2005 im 2006 fig 2 a f all simulations were very accurate the slopes of the linear regression of 0 95 1 08 were very close to one and the coefficient of determination r2 values of 0 92 0 99 were also very close to one the other statistical indices also indicated accurate simulations of these parameters with values for dmp of re of 0 14 0 22 and d of 0 99 for crop n uptake of re of 0 14 0 26 and d of 0 99 and for etc of re of 0 07 0 32 and d of 0 95 0 99 table 5 in the simulation of etc in the two pepper treatments of 2005 the model overestimated etc in the last two thirds of the crop where re values were double those of the 2006 pepper treatments fig 2f table 5 in all of the melon treatments eu rotate n was able to predict reasonably well marketable fresh fruit yield however there was a tendency to slightly overestimate which was on average 10 table 6 in the 2006 pepper treatments the simulation of marketable fresh fruit yield was very accurate with an error of 5 compared to measured values in the 2005 pepper treatments the model overestimated marketable fruit production by 40 compared to measured values table 6 3 3 simulation of drainage and no3 leaching under different water and n managements simulated and measured values of drainage for the four cropping sequences that were evaluated are presented in fig 3 a c e g drainage during each sequence included drainage during both the melon and pepper crops and the drainage that occurred during the bare soil period between the melon and pepper crops in general the model with greenhouse calibration had an acceptable performance for the simulation of drainage and was more accurate for the 2006 than the 2005 crops in the cm 2006 and the im 2006 treatments the simulation of drainage was very close to measured values during the crop growing periods re of 0 03 0 17 and d of 0 96 1 00 and during the period of bare soil re of 0 15 and 0 09 in cm 2006 and im 2006 respectively tables 4 5 in 2005 simulation of drainage from the two melon treatments was acceptable with re of 0 22 and 0 6 for the cm 2005 and im 2005 melon respectively the model slightly underestimated drainage in the last two thirds of the season of the two pepper treatments of 2005 fig 3a c which was the opposite to what occurred with the simulation of etc the performance of the model to simulate drainage during the period of bare soil between crops was accurate in 2006 and acceptable in 2005 fig 3a c e g the statistical indices showed larger errors in the simulation of drainage associated with the pepper crop and the bare soil period in 2005 compared to 2006 tables 4 5 in general the performance of the model to simulate no3 leaching was poorer than with drainage fig 3b d f h tables 4 5 the model had a general tendency to underestimate no3 leaching particularly in the 2005 pepper treatments where the errors of the simulation were higher maximum re of 0 5 and d of 0 78 table 5 in the two pepper treatments of 2006 the simulation of no3 leaching was acceptable re of 0 22 0 14 and d of 0 94 0 96 for cm 2006 and im 2006 respectively in the two melon treatments in both years the model overestimated no3 leaching in the im treatment re larger than 1 d of 0 56 and had a good performance with cm management re of 0 16 d 0 98 in 2006 and 0 28 d 0 92 in 2005 tables 4 5 during the period of bare soil between crops no3 leaching was overestimated by the model and appreciable errors were obtained in the statistical evaluation fig 3b d f h tables 4 5 despite these errors in the four sequences presented in fig 3 the model i accurately reproduced the seasonal trends of drainage and no3 leaching during the cropped periods and during the periods of bare soil between crops and ii accurately simulated the effect of different n and irrigation management practices on drainage and no3 leaching under im treatments the model simulated an appreciable decrease in drainage and no3 leaching in relation to cm during the cropped periods and during the periods of bare soil between crops considering the complete sequence the 2005 im treatments resulted in a decrease in simulated drainage of 89 mm in relation to the cm management this was only 7 less than the measured decrease simulated leaching for the im 2005 sequence was 39 less than the measured values similarly in 2006 the decrease in simulated drainage comparing cm and im was 98 mm which was only 6 less than the measured decrease the decrease in simulated no3 leaching was 34 less than the measured decrease 3 4 simulation of water and n dynamics in the soil under different water and n managements simulated and measured seasonal values of swc for the 0 30 and 30 60 cm soil layers are presented for the cm 2005 fig 4 a im 2005 fig 4c cm 2006 fig 4e and im 2006 fig 4g sequences each sequence includes the two crops and the intervening period of bare soil in all treatments the model simulated very well the seasonal evolution of swc in both layers the statistical indices confirmed the good performance of the model for simulating swc throughout the sequences table 7 in three of four treatment sequences re was 0 06 and d 0 95 table 7 soil water content was relatively constant during the period shown in fig 4 with values being consistently near field capacity table 1 pre transplanting irrigations before each crop and salt leaching irrigations in the 2005 sequences can be observed in fig 4a and c simulated soil mineral n for the 0 30 and 0 60 cm depths was slightly underestimated in 2006 fig 4f h and appreciably underestimated in 2005 fig 4b d the statistical indices reflected the larger errors of the 2005 simulations compared to those for 2006 table 7 the model was able to simulate very well the seasonal trends in soil mineral n in the four sequences of pepper bare soil melon in both years for both cm and im including those associated to the management of bare soil during the period between crops in summer the evaluations of soil mineral n considered mineral fertilizer n applications in 2005 the decrease in soil mineral n during summer bare soil period was due to the large irrigation volumes for soil disinfection and salt leaching applied on days 119 and 120 after planting of the pepper crop that leached large amounts of no3 from the soil fig 3b d and reduced considerably the amounts of soil mineral n in both treatments in 2006 the amount of water applied in summer to bare soil was less as was the relative reduction in soil mineral n 4 discussion 4 1 calibration of the eu rotate n model for greenhouse grown melon and pepper crops the first part of this study compared the simulation of various crop and soil output variables using a the default calibration and b the greenhouse calibration parameters that were derived in this study the greenhouse calibration parameters were those related to crop growth the critical n curve and parameters determining etc the use of greenhouse calibration compared to default calibration values had different effects depending on the crop species and the parameters evaluated in both melon and pepper adjusting the values of base temperature and of cumulative thermal time to initiate root growth had very little effect on the simulation of dmp which was of acceptable accuracy without modifying these calibration parameters the accurate simulation of dmp by eu rotate n using default calibration values is not surprising given that crop growth is simulated using a simple target value approach with this approach a value for maximum achievable dry matter production is entered by the user based on experience and a growth curve for accumulated dry matter production throughout the crop is then fitted nendel et al 2012 growth is linearly reduced by water or n deficiency nendel et al 2012 in the current work the measured total dmp was used as the target value and there were no water or n limitations most published work with eu rotate n confirms the accurate simulation of seasonal dmp using the default calibration values of the model e g nendel et al 2012 the critical n curve used by eu rotate n to calculate the critical n the minimum n content in the plant required for maximum growth has two coefficients for a given species rahn et al 2010 greenhouse calibration of the critical n curve coefficients had a large positive effect in the simulation of seasonal n uptake of melon with re decreasing from 0 78 to 0 19 compared to using the default calibration however in pepper greenhouse calibration did not improve the accuracy of simulation and consequently the default coefficients for the critical n curve were used these results are similar to those of doltra and muñoz 2010 in open field production where the default values for critical n curve coefficients provided accurate simulation of crop n uptake with pepper but gave an appreciable underestimation with cauliflower taken together these results suggest that under mediterranean conditions that the default coefficients of eu rotate n for critical n curves are suitable for pepper but for a number of other species such as melon and cauliflower that a more specific calibration may be required in china sun et al 2012 obtained a good fit between simulated and measured values of dmp and crop n uptake for greenhouse cucumber after calibrating the crop base temperature and the critical n coefficients nendel et al 2012 evaluated eu rotate in several different vegetable rotations using default calibration values and reported accurate simulation of dmp however there was over estimation of crop n content and crop n uptake during the crop growing season in general the available results indicate that for most vegetable species calibration for greenhouse conditions enhances the simulation of crop n content and crop n uptake but in some cases such as pepper under mediterranean conditions the default calibration values are adequate eu rotate n uses the dual crop coefficient approach of fao allen et al 1998 to simulate etc for greenhouse calibration for simulation of etc three components were calibrated or adjusted these were i the basal crop coefficient kcb values and the lengths of the four corresponding growth stages ii the equation to calculate eto and iii the soil evaporation component to account for the gravel mulch used for soil grown crops in greenhouses in se spain following the standard fao methodology the default settings of eu rotate n assume fixed periods for each of the four growth stages in this work the length of the growth stages obtained for the 2006 calibration melon crop were not suitable for the 2005 melon crop that was planted one month later table 2 and had shorter growth stages for three of the four crop coefficient kc growth stages the use of fixed length growth stages as assumed by the fao methodology is not suitable for vegetable crops grown in greenhouses in se spain where the planting dates and lengths of crops vary for market or practical farming reasons such variation is probably also the case in many other vegetable cropping systems simple models based on thermal time have been developed to calculate daily kc values for greenhouse grown vegetables crops in se spain to deal with variation in cropping dates gallardo et al 2011 2016 orgaz et al 2005 the fao56 penman monteith equation which is recommended by fao as the standard method for eto estimation allen et al 1998 is used as the default method to calculate eto by eu rotate n fernández et al 2010 2011 demonstrated in plastic mediterranean greenhouses that the fao56 penman monteith equation underestimated measured eto and that the use of a fixed aerodynamic resistance value of 295 s m 1 enabled accurate estimation of eto consequently the penman monteith equation adapted to plastic mediterranean greenhouses that uses this aerodynamic resistance value was used in this study while eu rotate n can simulate evaporation from soil it cannot do so for a mulched soil it was assumed that evaporation from the gravel mulch was negligible no experimentally determined values were available adjustments were made to the values of readily evaporative water rew and the thickness of the crop evaporation layer ze in order to minimize calculated values of soil evaporation with these adjustments to minimize surface evaporation there was excellent agreement between simulated and measured etc values in both melon and pepper suggesting that the assumption of very low soil evaporation was correct after calibrating or adjusting the three components of etc referred to two paragraphs previously there was excellent agreement between simulated and measured values of etc in the cm 2006 calibration crops fig 1c because eu rotate n uses a water balance approach the improved simulation of etc achieved by greenhouse calibration considerably improved simulation of drainage volume and to a lesser degree improved the simulation of the seasonal dynamics of soil water content swc compared to the default calibration the greenhouse calibration reduced the re for drainage from 0 51 to 0 11 for the complete cm 2006 sequence data not presented and reduced the re for swc from 0 16 to 0 04 for the complete cm 2006 sequence data not presented greenhouse calibration of crop n uptake considerably improved simulation of the seasonal values of soil mineral n in the calibration crops cm 2006 melon and pepper crops fig 1g no3 leaching was well simulated in melon and less effectively simulated in pepper this occurred despite the excellent simulation of drainage the errors associated with simulation of mineral soil n presumably contributed to the error in the simulation of no3 leaching 4 2 performance of the eu rotate n model in sequences of melon bare soil pepper under different water and n management eu rotate n accurately simulated dry matter production dmp crop n uptake and marketable fruit production in all treatments with errors that were lower or similar to those obtained in previous studies that evaluated eu rotate n in different cropping systems guo et al 2010 nendel et al 2012 rahn et al 2010 etc was very accurately simulated in the 2006 melon and pepper crops and the 2005 melon crops and was slightly overestimated in the 2005 pepper crops the overestimation in the 2005 pepper crops was presumably related to a high incidence of pepper vein mottling virus pvmv eu rotate n like all crop models assumes that crops are free of pests and diseases the leaf chlorosis caused by the virus probably affected photosynthetic capacity and crop transpiration the simulated dmp of the crop was not affected by the virus infection since the maximum dmp was used as the target dmp value however marketable fruit yield of the 2005 pepper was overestimated for both conventional and improved management by the model for the four sequences examined there was generally accurate simulation of drainage and etc throughout both the cm and im cropping sequences in 2006 there was accurate simulation of both drainage and etc throughout the cm and im melon crops and the bare soil period of the 2005 sequence drainage was accurately simulated the overestimation of drainage in the cm and im pepper crops of the 2005 sequence is attributable to the virus infection that was previously discussed with greenhouse grown tomato in soil soto et al 2014 reported adequate simulation of drainage with eu rotate n in nine of ten treatments to our knowledge there are no other published studies in which simulations of drainage by eu rotate n were compared with measured drainage eu rotate n very accurately simulated soil water content in the 0 30 and 30 60 cm soil layers other authors in different conditions have reported good performance of the model to simulate soil water content dynamics doltra and muñoz 2010 rahn et al 2010 soto et al 2014 sun et al 2012 soil mineral n was generally underestimated by eu rotate n in the current study the error being larger in the 2005 sequences and lower in the 2006 sequences however the model accurately simulated the seasonal trends of soil mineral n showing a sharp decrease in soil mineral n in the bare soil period between crops particularly in 2005 when the irrigations were much larger than in the equivalent period in 2006 the larger errors in the simulations of mineral n in the 2005 crops were probably due to the manure addition in 2003 which would have had more impact in 2005 than in 2006 manure addition is a common practice in this vegetable production system thompson et al 2007 other authors have reported underestimation of soil mineral n by eu rotate n that was attributed to underestimation of n mineralized from previously applications of organic material doltra and muñoz 2010 nendel et al 2012 moreover the eu rotate n coefficients of n mineralization for organic amendments were obtained in northern western european countries and may require adjustments for warmer climates doltra et al 2010 working in spain lidón et al 2011 and olasolo et al 2011 suggested that the n mineralization parameters of eu rotate n should be calibrated and validated for warmer conditions to enhance simulation of soil mineral n dynamics additionally the underestimation of soil mineral n in the 2005 crop sequences may be related to the reported reduced capacity of the model to accurately simulate soil mineral n under conditions of high soil mineral n several studies have observed that under high soil mineral n eu rotate n less accurately simulated soil mineral n doltra et al 2010 guo et al 2010 soto et al 2014 sun et al 2012 compared to drainage there was a general tendency to underestimate no3 leaching which was more pronounced in the 2005 pepper crops which suffered a notable virus infection soto et al 2014 reported that eu rotate n underestimated no3 leaching by 31 in tomato crops in the greenhouse system of se spain given that in the current study and in soto et al 2014 eu rotate n accurately simulated drainage and underestimated no3 leaching it is suggested that the appreciable underestimation of no3 leaching may be related to the apparent under estimation of n mineralization of manure n discussed previously there are no other published studies that compare simulated values of no3 leaching using eu rotate n to measured data in contrast numerous studies have used eu rotate n to estimate no3 leaching under different fertilizer treatments without previous validation de waele et al 2017 doltra and muñoz 2010 guo et al 2010 rahn et al 2010 sun et al 2012 in the bare soil period between crops in all four sequences eu rotate n accurately simulated the large and rapid increases in drainage and no3 leaching fig 3 that followed the large irrigations associated with salt leaching irrigation and chemical disinfection of soil the differences in the amounts of drainage and no3 leached between the two years is due to large irrigations applied in 2005 to both decrease and homogenize the soil no3 content for experimental purposes the volumes of the irrigations applied during the 2006 bare soil period are more representative of local farming practices these results are consistent with the observations of thompson et al 2007 that in this growing system large soil management irrigations in the between crop summer period can leach large amounts of mineral n that had accumulated during previous cropped periods direct comparison of simulations of the two treatments of the same crop with differences in irrigation and n management demonstrated the usefulness of eu rotate n to examine the effects of crop management on drainage no3 leaching and soil mineral n dynamics under mediterranean greenhouse conditions 5 conclusions compared to default values in situ calibration hereafter referred to as greenhouse calibration of some parameters related to crop growth the critical n curve and etc considerably improved the performance of eu rotate n for simulating crop n uptake and seasonal etc in melon and pepper compared to the default calibration the greenhouse calibration did not improve the simulation of dmp in both crops or the simulation of crop n uptake in pepper simulation of other parameters such as drainage no3 leaching and of both soil water and soil mineral n dynamics were considerably improved by the greenhouse calibration in general with the greenhouse calibration simulated values of dmp crop n uptake and etc were close to measured values with the slopes of linear regression between simulated and measured values being very close to 1 range of 0 95 1 08 and coefficients of determination r2 being 0 92 0 99 eu rotate n was able to simulate with reasonable accuracy marketable fresh fruit yield with an overestimate of 10 in the 2005 and 2006 melon crops and in the 2006 pepper crops in general eu rotate n provided acceptable simulation of drainage while no3 leaching was consistently underestimated eu rotate n overestimated etc and underestimated drainage in both the 2005 pepper cm and im treatments which was attributed to a virus infection the virus infection was also presumably a contributing factor to the relatively larger errors associated with the simulation of no3 leaching and of marketable fruit yield in these treatments during the period of bare soil between crops the performance of eu rotate n to simulate drainage was generally acceptable and no3 leaching was overestimated in all treatments eu rotate n accurately simulated the seasonal evolution of swc in the 0 30 and 30 60 cm soil layers simulation of soil mineral n in the 0 30 and 0 60 cm layers was slightly underestimated by the model in 2006 and appreciably underestimated in 2005 eu rotate n accurately simulated seasonal trends in soil mineral n in the four sequences examined

11571,the capacity of the eu rotate n model to simulate agronomic parameters dry matter production yield crop n uptake evapotranspiration etc soil water content dynamics and parameters associated to nitrate no3 pollution drainage no3 leaching accumulation of mineral n in soil was evaluated in sequences of melon and pepper crops grown in plastic greenhouses simulated values of all output variables were compared to measured values two sequences with either conventional or improved management for water and n were examined during the 2005 and 2006 cropping seasons additionally simulation of drainage and no3 leaching was evaluated during the period between crops following irrigations associated with soil disinfection and leaching of accumulated salts calibration of parameters related to crop growth the critical n curve and etc considerably improved simulation of drainage no3 leaching and of soil water and soil mineral n dynamics following calibration the eu rotate n model accurately simulated dry matter production crop n uptake and marketable fruit yield the simulation errors being lower or similar to those reported elsewhere etc and drainage were accurately simulated in the 2006 melon and pepper crops and in the 2005 melon crop they were respectively over and under estimated in the 2005 pepper crop probably on account of a virus infection eu rotate n accurately simulated soil water content for the 0 30 and 30 60 cm soil layers soil mineral n and no3 leaching were generally underestimated by eu rotate n the error being larger in the 2005 sequences however the model effectively simulated seasonal trends keywords modeling nitrate leaching drainage n management fertigation 1 introduction the eu rotate n model was developed to simulate nitrogen n use and losses in rotations of european open field vegetable crops outputs of eu rotate n include crop growth fruit yield crop n uptake crop evapotranspiration etc drainage and nitrate no3 leaching rahn et al 2010 additionally eu rotate n calculates soil mineral n and water dynamics n mineralization from organic material various soil n transformations and root development rahn et al 2010 the model has been used as i a tool to assess effects of different fertilizer and rotation practices on n losses to the environment and gross margin returns and ii as a decision support system for improving n management to reduce n losses while maintaining yield the eu rotate n model has been used across a wide range of crop growing conditions such as open field crops in northern europe and the mediterranean region de waele et al 2017 doltra and muñoz 2010 nendel et al 2012 rahn et al 2010 and in greenhouses in china guo et al 2010 sun et al 2012 eu rotate n is a versatile simulation model of both agronomic e g yield growth and environmental parameters e g no3 leaching drainage that has been calibrated for more than 70 vegetable and cereal species rahn et al 2010 it can be used with rain fed crops and with different irrigation systems with conventional split fertilizer applications or fertigation and can be used with crop sequences rahn et al 2010 the eu rotate n model is unique for the number of vegetable species for which default calibrations are provided thompson et al 2017 most simulation models for vegetable crops are specific to a single species thompson et al 2017 a number of studies have evaluated the performance of eu rotate n for simulation of i agronomic parameters such as dry matter production marketable yield or crop n uptake and ii trends of soil water and mineral n content by comparing simulated with experimentally measured values doltra et al 2010 guo et al 2010 nendel et al 2012 rahn et al 2010 in most of these evaluations the default calibration values provided by eu rotate n for each species were used doltra and muñoz 2010 guo et al 2010 nendel et al 2012 rahn et al 2010 rather than determining calibration values for the crops and systems being examined in most of the studies where no3 leaching and drainage were simulated the simulated values of no3 leaching and drainage were not compared to experimentally measured values de waele et al 2017 doltra and muñoz 2010 guo et al 2010 with the exception of the study with tomato by soto et al 2014 there are no published studies with eu rotate n that have compared simulated to measured values of etc drainage and no3 leaching this is surprising given that simulation with eu rotate n is commonly used to determine the impact of crop management on no3 leaching e g de waele et al 2017 doltra and muñoz 2010 guo et al 2010 rahn et al 2010 sun et al 2012 the greenhouse vegetable production system on the south eastern se mediterranean coast of spain with 37 000 ha is one of the largest concentrations of greenhouses in the world castilla and hernández 2005 nitrate leaching and drainage are important issues with this vegetable production system there is substantial no3 contamination of underlying aquifers and a rising water table caused by drainage returns to a shallow aquifer that risks flooding low lying areas pulido bosch et al 1997 pulido bosch 2005 due to no3 contamination of underlying aquifers most of the areas where the greenhouses are located have been declared nitrate vulnerable zones in accordance with the european union nitrate directive anon 1991 which requires the adoption of improved management practices in se spain many greenhouse vegetable growers cultivate two crops per cropping season a common cropping sequence is a spring melon crop grown from february march until june july followed by an autumn winter sweet pepper crop from july to late december february during the period between crops in the summer additional irrigations involving large volumes of water are applied i to leach salts ii for soil disinfection and iii to moisten the soil profile immediately prior to transplanting the following crop thompson et al 2007 results of a survey conducted by thompson et al 2007 showed that salt leaching irrigations with volumes 20 mm and 40 mm were applied in respectively 69 and 42 of greenhouses and that volumes of water of 20 were applied in 78 of greenhouses for soil disinfection drainage associated with the large irrigations used for salt leaching soil disinfection and for moistening the soil profile is likely to be an important contributing factor to aquifer no3 contamination thompson et al 2007 analysis of the environmental impact of this system in relation to no3 leaching loss should consider cropping sequences including the management of bare soil between crops the eu rotate n model is uniquely suited to simulate and examine such sequences the mains objectives of this work were to evaluate the capacity of the eu rotate n model to simulate a agronomic variables dry matter production marketable fruit yield crop n uptake etc dynamics of soil water content swc and b variables associated to no3 pollution drainage and no3 leaching accumulation of soil mineral n in sequences of melon bare soil pepper for soil grown crops in plastic mediterranean greenhouses an additional objective was to evaluate the effect of calibration of various parameters on the accuracy of the model compared to the use of default calibration values 2 materials and methods 2 1 location and cropping details the crops were grown in two plastic

daily average vapor pressure deficit vpd was 0 7 2 0 kpa during warmer periods of the pepper crops whitewash suspension of calcium carbonate was applied to the greenhouse roof to reduce the temperature inside the greenhouse 2 2 irrigation and n treatments for each sequence and crop two treatments of combined irrigation and n management were applied in each greenhouse in one greenhouse conventional management cm of n and irrigation was used in the other greenhouse improved management im of both n and irrigation was used the cm and im treatments are referred here to as cm 2005 im 2005 for the crops in 2005 and cm 2006 and im 2006 for the crops during 2006 a detailed description of the management of n and irrigation in the 2006 sequence is presented in granados et al 2013 irrigation treatments were applied in three stages i a pre transplant irrigation ii during the three week period of plantlet establishment and iii from crop establishment to the end of the crop in the cm treatments of all crops the volumes of pre transplant irrigations and both the volumes and frequency of irrigation during the plantlet establishment period followed the recommendations of local technical advisors in each cm crop a single pre transplant irrigation was applied the day before transplanting from the end of the plantlet establishment period until the end of the crop irrigation volumes were determined by multiplying historical values of etc bonachela et al 2006 by values of relative irrigation supply ris previously determined for different periods of the cropping cycle for each species in a survey of commercial irrigation practice in the region fernández et al 2007 the n concentrations in the applied nutrient solutions in the cm melon and pepper crops followed established local management practices in both years which were determined in consultation with local technical advisers the average n concentration of the nutrient solution was approximately 12 mmol l 1 table 2 the improved management im practices consisted of prescriptive corrective management granados et al 2013 using simulation models to estimate crop water and n requirements and soil monitoring approaches to make adjustments to ensure optimal management in the im managed greenhouse pre transplant irrigations consisted of a series of small irrigations of 1 2 mm at 1 2 day intervals to ensure that matric potential was 10 to 15 kpa during the period of plantlet establishment irrigation was applied to maintain matric potential between 5 and 10 kpa after crop establishment irrigation volumes for im treatments were based on estimated historical etc bonachela et al 2006 and were adjusted to ensure that the soil matric potential remained within the range of 10 to 30 kpa in the im 2005 melon crop the n concentration applied was the same as for the cm in im 2005 pepper there was a targeted reduction of 40 in the n concentration of the applied solution after crop establishment in the 2006 im crops n management was based on simulating crop n requirements with subsequent adjustment being made to maintain soil solution no3 concentration at 8 12 mmol l 1 granados et al 2013 approximately 95 of added n was no3 the remainder was ammonium nh4 which is consistent with local practice the total amounts of irrigation n applied and the average applied n concentrations are presented in table 2 chemical soil disinfection was conducted between crops by applying metham potassium in irrigations of 24 mm on 26 june 2005 and of 20 mm on 1 july 2005 in 2006 irrigations associated to soil disinfection with metham postassium were 21 and 18 mm applied on 8 and 15 june 2006 respectively all irrigations associated with chemical soil disinfection were applied through the drip system no nutrients were applied in these irrigations the volumes applied in the disinfection irrigations were the same for the two treatments two irrigations of 49 mm and 44 mm were applied on 14 and 15 july 2005 in both greenhouses to leach accumulated salts the pre transplanting irrigations referred to previously were considered as part of soil management in the period between crops additional irrigations were applied during the between crop period to clean the drip system using acid and to assess application uniformity 2 3 measurements all measurements of crop and soil parameters from each greenhouse were made with four replicates different zones of each greenhouse were sampled to ensure that the replicates represented the entire greenhouse air dry t and wet bulb temperatures were measured in both greenhouses at a height of 2 m using aspirated psychrometers priva nutricontrol veghel the netherlands data were measured and recorded every 5 min relative humidity rh and vapor pressure deficit vpd were calculated from these data solar radiation inside the greenhouses was measured using a pyranometer model sks1110 skye instruments llandrindod wells wales united kingdom solar radiation was measured every 30 s and 30 min average values were recorded with a data logger model cr10x campbell scientific inc logan utah usa throughout the study period climatic data were very similar in both greenhouses data were averaged from both greenhouses irrigation volumes of nutrient solution for each greenhouse were measured daily with water meters model arad m 15 zenner saarbrucken germany each week two replicate samples of irrigation were collected for determination of concentrations of no3 and nh4 drainage was collected daily using two replicate free draining re packed lysimeters 4 m long 2 m wide 0 7 m deep located in the southern side of each greenhouse the bottom and walls of the lysimeters were lined with butyl rubber the soil profile in the lysimeter reproduced that of the outside area described above to a depth of 0 6 m with a layer of gravel placed between the butyl rubber sheet and the layered soil the lysimeters are described in detail by bonachela et al 2006 representative sub samples of the lysimeter drainage solutions were collected daily and analyzed for concentrations of no3 and nh4 the daily amount of no3 leached was calculated from drainage volume drainage no3 concentration and the 8 m2 surface area of the lysimeters amounts of nh4 leached were negligible the no3 and nh4 concentrations in applied nutrient solutions and in drainage were analyzed with an automatic continuous segmented flow analyzer model san skalar analytical b v breda the netherlands crop evapotranspiration was measured weekly using the water balance approach based on measurements of the change in measured volumetric soil water content swc between weekly periods and the total volume of applied irrigation and drainage collected for the weekly period under consideration the swc data were measured with capacitance sensors cs model rt6 sentek sensor technologies south australia australia and recorded at 30 min intervals for the 0 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 30 cm soil depths relative to the surface of the imported soil in the lysimeters with two sensors in each of the two lysimeters in each greenhouse the value of swc at 6 am for 0 30 cm soil was used for the water balance a calibration of the cs sensors was made for each layer of the experimental soil before installation each cs was normalized with air and with a representative nutrient solution as applied to the cm managed crops soil was sampled and analyzed for mineral n no3 and nh4 and gravimetric soil water content immediately before mid way through and at the end of each crop soil was sampled in two 30 cm depth increments to 60 cm depth for each soil sampling soil was sampled in four replicate locations in each greenhouse treatment and in each location there were three sampling positions 1 5 cm from and perpendicular to the drip emitter 2 mid way between emitters within the same emitter line and 5 cm from the drip line and 3 mid way between adjacent crop and drip lines parallel with drippers each depth increment from each sampling position within each replicate location was treated as a separate sample the mineral n content of the soil was determined following extraction by potassium chloride kcl 40 g moist soil 200 ml 2 m kcl concentrations of no3 and nh4 in the soil extracts were determined using the automatic segmented flow analyzer described previously for the analysis of nutrient solutions and drainage with respect to the sampling positions soil mineral n and soil water content was calculated as 0 25 x position 1 0 25 x position 2 0 50 x position 3 measurements of dry matter production dmp were made during each cropping season by sampling two entire plants from the four different replicate zones of each greenhouse the amount of dry matter of leaves stems and fruit was determined by weighing all fresh material of each component and the percentage of dry matter content was determined by oven drying representative samples at 65 c until constant weight additionally four replicate areas of 4 m2 in each greenhouse each with eight plants were marked to determine the mass of dry matter of all pruned material removed during the season and of total fruit production at each pruning the amounts of dry matter removed were determined during the fruit production phase mature fruit was collected from the marked plants and fresh and dry weights were determined for each biomass sampling date the total dmp was calculated as the sum of dry matter of plant biomass for that sampling date and of both total pruned material and harvested fruit up to that date at the end of the crop the eight marked plants previously used for following pruning and fruit production were harvested and the final dmp was calculated as the sum of the dry matter at the final plant sampling the dry matter of all pruned material and the dry matter of total fruit production from each sampling of biomass pruning or fruit harvest representative individual samples of leaves stems and fruits were ground separately first with a knife mill model sm100 comfort retsch haan germany and then with a ball mill model mm200 retsch haan germany and the total n content was determined using a dumas type elemental analyzer system model ea 3000 eurovector s p a milan italy crop n uptake was determined for each sampling date from measurements of dry matter and n content for each replicate for that date crop n uptake was above ground n uptake it was assumed that root n uptake was relatively very small in a fertigated drip irrigated system with very frequent small n applications 2 4 the eu rotate n simulation model model settings inputs and calibration eu rotate n is a simulation model developed to be a decision support system for n management in vegetable crop rotations throughout europe a detailed description of the model was published by rahn et al 2010 eu rotate n simulates crop growth and the n and water dynamics in the soil plant system on a daily basis in the current work version 1 8 2009 was used simulations were conducted for sequences of melon bare soil pepper table 2 daily values of daily maximum and minimum temperature and relative humidity wind speed daily sum of solar radiation and reference evapotranspiration eto were the input data for the meteorological data file required to run the model rainfall was always set to zero since wind speed is almost negligible inside greenhouses in this region a constant average daily value of 0 1 m s 1 was used fernández et al 2010 reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated using the penman monteith equation adapted for mediterranean type plastic greenhouses with a fixed aerodynamic resistance of 295 s cm 1 fernández et al 2010 2011 and was introduced as an input in the meteorological data file greenhouse data of crop management and soil properties were entered as inputs into the model the soil profile was modelled as being six consecutive 10 cm deep layers the surface layer of gravel was not considered to be part of the soil profile because of its negligible capacity for retaining water and nutrients relevant properties of each soil depth are presented in table 1 for each simulation initial model input values of soil water content and soil mineral n table 2 were those measured at the beginning of each treatment the drainage coefficient for each soil layer table 1 was calculated as described by doltra and muñoz 2010 n fertilizer applications were entered into the model as occurring in all individual irrigations as irrigations with specified n concentrations g l 1 for the fraction of soil area wetted by irrigation a value of 0 5 was used for all treatments the target dry matter value in the input file table 2 was the measured final total dry matter produced during the crop it was assumed that there was only one fruit harvest at the end of each crop which was the sum of the periodic fruit harvests previous work with pepper in this greenhouse system demonstrated significant errors in the simulation of dmp with eu rotate n when multiple fruit harvests were considered in the input file gallardo et al 2011 simulations using the default calibration parameters for melon and pepper provided in the data base of the model were conducted for the cm 2006 melon bare soil pepper sequence table 3 the outputs from these simulations using the default calibration parameters were compared with experimental data the eu rotate n model was calibrated for greenhouse grown melon and pepper crops using data from the cm 2006 melon and pepper crops that were representative of local practices this calibration is hereafter referred to as the greenhouse calibration the parameters determined for the greenhouse calibration were those related to crop growth crop n uptake etc and marketable yield table 3 base temperatures of 12 and 10 c were used for melon and pepper respectively fernández et al 2001 the lag period before root growth begins ddglag was assumed to be 0 c day 1 considering that the crop was transplanted with 4 5 leaves and growing conditions were favorable for immediate establishment the coefficients a and b of the exponential equation to calculate the critical n the minimum n content in the crop required for maximum dry matter production of the critical n curve rahn et al 2010 were obtained for melon from previous work gallardo et al 2011 in pepper the default values of the model were used for the critical n curve the empirical coefficients for the direct conversion algorithms for the calculation of fruit yield from plant dry matter production rahn et al 2010 were obtained from the calibration crops the maximum crop height was increased to 3 0 m for melon and to 1 5 m for pepper to adapt to the taller height of the greenhouse grown crops which were supported with nylon cords table 3 crop evapotranspiration etc was calculated by eu rotate n using the fao approach with dual crop coefficient values allen et al 1998 the three basal crop coefficients kcb and the length of the four crop growth stages were adjusted until the differences between simulated and measured values of etc in the calibration crops were minimized since the 2006 melon was planted one month earlier than the 2005 melon the lengths of the growth stages and the kcb values were additionally determined for the 2005 melon crop using the cm 2005 treatment table 3 for the rest of crop parameters the default values for melon and pepper in the crop data base of eu rotate n version 1 8 were used to consider the effect of reduced evaporation from the soil surface due to the mulching effect of the superficial gravel layer the parameters determining soil evaporation were adjusted these parameters were i readily evaporable water rew and ii the thickness of the evaporation layer ze different scenarios were compared in the cm 2006 pepper crop to obtain the values that minimized soil evaporation and reduced the differences between simulated and measured etc during the season the selected values were rew of 0 2 and ze of 0 01 in the four cropping sequences examined the eu rotate n model was used to simulate the entire complete sequence of melon bare soil pepper in these simulations the greenhouse calibration parameters and the adjusted soil evaporation coefficients were always used 2 5 model performance evaluation eu rotate n was validated by comparing simulated seasonal values that used the greenhouse calibration parameters to measured seasonal values of i above ground dry matter production ii crop n uptake iii etc iv drainage and no3 leaching from 0 to 60 cm of soil and iv soil water content in the 0 30 and 30 60 cm and v soil mineral n in the 0 30 and 0 60 cm soil layers experimental data from the cm 2005 and im 2005 sequences and from the im 2006 sequence were used for validation table 2 the following statistical indices were used following willmott 1982 to evaluate the agreement of simulated with measured values 1 the root mean square error rmse calculated as r m s e i 1 n p i o i n where n is the number of cases pi and oi are the ith predicted simulated and observed measured values the rmse reflects the differences between simulated and measured values and the units are the same as the units of the observed values the lower limit of rmse is 0 indicating perfect agreement between simulated and measured values 2 the relative error re r e r m s e o where o is the mean of the measured data the re is similar to a coefficient of variation since it relates the error rmse between simulated and measured value to the measured average the lower limit of re is 0 indicating perfect agreement between simulated and measured values 3 the willmott 1982 index of agreement d where and the letters p and o were previously defined the index of agreement d is a descriptive measure of the relative size of the differences between simulated and measured values and is useful to compare the performance of different models willmott 1982 values of the index of agreement range from 0 to 1 where a value of 1 indicates perfect agreement 4 linear regression analysis forced through zero between simulated y variable and measured x variable values that were compared to the 1 1 line for statistically significant differences p 0 05 in slope and intercept values the slope m and the coefficient of determination r2 of the regression equation were considered in addition to agreement with the 1 1 line 3 results 3 1 influence of the calibration of the main crop parameters on eu rotate n simulation simulated values using both the default and the greenhouse calibration parameters and measured values of several output variables for the cm 2006 melon bare soil pepper sequence are presented in fig 1 for these output variables apart from seasonal dmp in both crops fig 1a and seasonal crop n uptake in pepper 2006 fig 1b the greenhouse calibration considerably improved the accuracy of the simulation compared to the default calibration using the default calibration the model was poor at simulating seasonal crop n uptake in melon 2006 fig 1b and overestimated seasonal etc particularly so in melon 2006 fig 1c in both crops the use of the greenhouse calibration of etc and the adjustment of the soil evaporation coefficients enabled a better adjustment between simulated and measured values of etc particularly in the early part of the growing season of the crops fig 1c the statistical indices for each output variable when using the default and greenhouse calibrations for simulations of the cm 2006 sequence are presented in table 4 the greenhouse calibration considerably improved the performance of the model appreciably reducing the errors associated with the default calibration which were more apparent in melon than in pepper table 4 in melon using the greenhouse compared to the default calibration reduced re by 65 76 and 89 for seasonal dmp crop n uptake and etc respectively in pepper the reduction in re achieved by the greenhouse calibration compared to default calibration was 30 for both seasonal dmp and seasonal crop n uptake and 82 for etc following greenhouse calibration there was very good agreement between simulated and measured values of seasonal dmp fig 1a re 0 09 d 1 in melon and re 0 17 d 0 97 in pepper seasonal values of crop n uptake re 0 19 d 0 99 in melon re 0 15 and d 0 99 in pepper and of seasonal etc re 0 08 d 1 in melon re 0 03 and d 1 in pepper table 4 the simulation of other output variables such as seasonal drainage seasonal no3 leaching and of soil water and soil mineral n dynamics which were not directly calibrated in this study but were indirectly affected by calibration were considerably improved by the greenhouse calibration fig 1 the calibration of etc resulted in a large improvement in the simulation of drainage during both the melon and pepper crops prior to the greenhouse calibration drainage was considerably underestimated by the model and was associated with large errors fig 1d table 4 similar to drainage simulation of no3 leaching was underestimated when calibrated using default values during the melon crop and in the initial part of the pepper and was overestimated during the bare soil period between crops fig 1e after greenhouse calibration the agreement between simulated and measured values of no3 leaching improved in melon and during the period of bare soil but did not improve in the pepper crop simulated soil water content was much lower than that of measured values using the default calibration and was very close to measured values when the greenhouse calibration was used fig 1f soil mineral n was appreciably overestimated by the model using the default calibration but like the soil water content was close to measured values when the greenhouse calibration was used fig 1g all errors associated with the statistical evaluation of the model were considerably reduced with the greenhouse calibration table 4 3 2 simulation of dry matter n uptake evapotranspiration and yield simulated values of seasonal dmp crop n uptake and etc are plotted against measured values for pooled data through the cropping season for the three validation crops cm 2005 im 2005 im 2006 fig 2 a f all simulations were very accurate the slopes of the linear regression of 0 95 1 08 were very close to one and the coefficient of determination r2 values of 0 92 0 99 were also very close to one the other statistical indices also indicated accurate simulations of these parameters with values for dmp of re of 0 14 0 22 and d of 0 99 for crop n uptake of re of 0 14 0 26 and d of 0 99 and for etc of re of 0 07 0 32 and d of 0 95 0 99 table 5 in the simulation of etc in the two pepper treatments of 2005 the model overestimated etc in the last two thirds of the crop where re values were double those of the 2006 pepper treatments fig 2f table 5 in all of the melon treatments eu rotate n was able to predict reasonably well marketable fresh fruit yield however there was a tendency to slightly overestimate which was on average 10 table 6 in the 2006 pepper treatments the simulation of marketable fresh fruit yield was very accurate with an error of 5 compared to measured values in the 2005 pepper treatments the model overestimated marketable fruit production by 40 compared to measured values table 6 3 3 simulation of drainage and no3 leaching under different water and n managements simulated and measured values of drainage for the four cropping sequences that were evaluated are presented in fig 3 a c e g drainage during each sequence included drainage during both the melon and pepper crops and the drainage that occurred during the bare soil period between the melon and pepper crops in general the model with greenhouse calibration had an acceptable performance for the simulation of drainage and was more accurate for the 2006 than the 2005 crops in the cm 2006 and the im 2006 treatments the simulation of drainage was very close to measured values during the crop growing periods re of 0 03 0 17 and d of 0 96 1 00 and during the period of bare soil re of 0 15 and 0 09 in cm 2006 and im 2006 respectively tables 4 5 in 2005 simulation of drainage from the two melon treatments was acceptable with re of 0 22 and 0 6 for the cm 2005 and im 2005 melon respectively the model slightly underestimated drainage in the last two thirds of the season of the two pepper treatments of 2005 fig 3a c which was the opposite to what occurred with the simulation of etc the performance of the model to simulate drainage during the period of bare soil between crops was accurate in 2006 and acceptable in 2005 fig 3a c e g the statistical indices showed larger errors in the simulation of drainage associated with the pepper crop and the bare soil period in 2005 compared to 2006 tables 4 5 in general the performance of the model to simulate no3 leaching was poorer than with drainage fig 3b d f h tables 4 5 the model had a general tendency to underestimate no3 leaching particularly in the 2005 pepper treatments where the errors of the simulation were higher maximum re of 0 5 and d of 0 78 table 5 in the two pepper treatments of 2006 the simulation of no3 leaching was acceptable re of 0 22 0 14 and d of 0 94 0 96 for cm 2006 and im 2006 respectively in the two melon treatments in both years the model overestimated no3 leaching in the im treatment re larger than 1 d of 0 56 and had a good performance with cm management re of 0 16 d 0 98 in 2006 and 0 28 d 0 92 in 2005 tables 4 5 during the period of bare soil between crops no3 leaching was overestimated by the model and appreciable errors were obtained in the statistical evaluation fig 3b d f h tables 4 5 despite these errors in the four sequences presented in fig 3 the model i accurately reproduced the seasonal trends of drainage and no3 leaching during the cropped periods and during the periods of bare soil between crops and ii accurately simulated the effect of different n and irrigation management practices on drainage and no3 leaching under im treatments the model simulated an appreciable decrease in drainage and no3 leaching in relation to cm during the cropped periods and during the periods of bare soil between crops considering the complete sequence the 2005 im treatments resulted in a decrease in simulated drainage of 89 mm in relation to the cm management this was only 7 less than the measured decrease simulated leaching for the im 2005 sequence was 39 less than the measured values similarly in 2006 the decrease in simulated drainage comparing cm and im was 98 mm which was only 6 less than the measured decrease the decrease in simulated no3 leaching was 34 less than the measured decrease 3 4 simulation of water and n dynamics in the soil under different water and n managements simulated and measured seasonal values of swc for the 0 30 and 30 60 cm soil layers are presented for the cm 2005 fig 4 a im 2005 fig 4c cm 2006 fig 4e and im 2006 fig 4g sequences each sequence includes the two crops and the intervening period of bare soil in all treatments the model simulated very well the seasonal evolution of swc in both layers the statistical indices confirmed the good performance of the model for simulating swc throughout the sequences table 7 in three of four treatment sequences re was 0 06 and d 0 95 table 7 soil water content was relatively constant during the period shown in fig 4 with values being consistently near field capacity table 1 pre transplanting irrigations before each crop and salt leaching irrigations in the 2005 sequences can be observed in fig 4a and c simulated soil mineral n for the 0 30 and 0 60 cm depths was slightly underestimated in 2006 fig 4f h and appreciably underestimated in 2005 fig 4b d the statistical indices reflected the larger errors of the 2005 simulations compared to those for 2006 table 7 the model was able to simulate very well the seasonal trends in soil mineral n in the four sequences of pepper bare soil melon in both years for both cm and im including those associated to the management of bare soil during the period between crops in summer the evaluations of soil mineral n considered mineral fertilizer n applications in 2005 the decrease in soil mineral n during summer bare soil period was due to the large irrigation volumes for soil disinfection and salt leaching applied on days 119 and 120 after planting of the pepper crop that leached large amounts of no3 from the soil fig 3b d and reduced considerably the amounts of soil mineral n in both treatments in 2006 the amount of water applied in summer to bare soil was less as was the relative reduction in soil mineral n 4 discussion 4 1 calibration of the eu rotate n model for greenhouse grown melon and pepper crops the first part of this study compared the simulation of various crop and soil output variables using a the default calibration and b the greenhouse calibration parameters that were derived in this study the greenhouse calibration parameters were those related to crop growth the critical n curve and parameters determining etc the use of greenhouse calibration compared to default calibration values had different effects depending on the crop species and the parameters evaluated in both melon and pepper adjusting the values of base temperature and of cumulative thermal time to initiate root growth had very little effect on the simulation of dmp which was of acceptable accuracy without modifying these calibration parameters the accurate simulation of dmp by eu rotate n using default calibration values is not surprising given that crop growth is simulated using a simple target value approach with this approach a value for maximum achievable dry matter production is entered by the user based on experience and a growth curve for accumulated dry matter production throughout the crop is then fitted nendel et al 2012 growth is linearly reduced by water or n deficiency nendel et al 2012 in the current work the measured total dmp was used as the target value and there were no water or n limitations most published work with eu rotate n confirms the accurate simulation of seasonal dmp using the default calibration values of the model e g nendel et al 2012 the critical n curve used by eu rotate n to calculate the critical n the minimum n content in the plant required for maximum growth has two coefficients for a given species rahn et al 2010 greenhouse calibration of the critical n curve coefficients had a large positive effect in the simulation of seasonal n uptake of melon with re decreasing from 0 78 to 0 19 compared to using the default calibration however in pepper greenhouse calibration did not improve the accuracy of simulation and consequently the default coefficients for the critical n curve were used these results are similar to those of doltra and muñoz 2010 in open field production where the default values for critical n curve coefficients provided accurate simulation of crop n uptake with pepper but gave an appreciable underestimation with cauliflower taken together these results suggest that under mediterranean conditions that the default coefficients of eu rotate n for critical n curves are suitable for pepper but for a number of other species such as melon and cauliflower that a more specific calibration may be required in china sun et al 2012 obtained a good fit between simulated and measured values of dmp and crop n uptake for greenhouse cucumber after calibrating the crop base temperature and the critical n coefficients nendel et al 2012 evaluated eu rotate in several different vegetable rotations using default calibration values and reported accurate simulation of dmp however there was over estimation of crop n content and crop n uptake during the crop growing season in general the available results indicate that for most vegetable species calibration for greenhouse conditions enhances the simulation of crop n content and crop n uptake but in some cases such as pepper under mediterranean conditions the default calibration values are adequate eu rotate n uses the dual crop coefficient approach of fao allen et al 1998 to simulate etc for greenhouse calibration for simulation of etc three components were calibrated or adjusted these were i the basal crop coefficient kcb values and the lengths of the four corresponding growth stages ii the equation to calculate eto and iii the soil evaporation component to account for the gravel mulch used for soil grown crops in greenhouses in se spain following the standard fao methodology the default settings of eu rotate n assume fixed periods for each of the four growth stages in this work the length of the growth stages obtained for the 2006 calibration melon crop were not suitable for the 2005 melon crop that was planted one month later table 2 and had shorter growth stages for three of the four crop coefficient kc growth stages the use of fixed length growth stages as assumed by the fao methodology is not suitable for vegetable crops grown in greenhouses in se spain where the planting dates and lengths of crops vary for market or practical farming reasons such variation is probably also the case in many other vegetable cropping systems simple models based on thermal time have been developed to calculate daily kc values for greenhouse grown vegetables crops in se spain to deal with variation in cropping dates gallardo et al 2011 2016 orgaz et al 2005 the fao56 penman monteith equation which is recommended by fao as the standard method for eto estimation allen et al 1998 is used as the default method to calculate eto by eu rotate n fernández et al 2010 2011 demonstrated in plastic mediterranean greenhouses that the fao56 penman monteith equation underestimated measured eto and that the use of a fixed aerodynamic resistance value of 295 s m 1 enabled accurate estimation of eto consequently the penman monteith equation adapted to plastic mediterranean greenhouses that uses this aerodynamic resistance value was used in this study while eu rotate n can simulate evaporation from soil it cannot do so for a mulched soil it was assumed that evaporation from the gravel mulch was negligible no experimentally determined values were available adjustments were made to the values of readily evaporative water rew and the thickness of the crop evaporation layer ze in order to minimize calculated values of soil evaporation with these adjustments to minimize surface evaporation there was excellent agreement between simulated and measured etc values in both melon and pepper suggesting that the assumption of very low soil evaporation was correct after calibrating or adjusting the three components of etc referred to two paragraphs previously there was excellent agreement between simulated and measured values of etc in the cm 2006 calibration crops fig 1c because eu rotate n uses a water balance approach the improved simulation of etc achieved by greenhouse calibration considerably improved simulation of drainage volume and to a lesser degree improved the simulation of the seasonal dynamics of soil water content swc compared to the default calibration the greenhouse calibration reduced the re for drainage from 0 51 to 0 11 for the complete cm 2006 sequence data not presented and reduced the re for swc from 0 16 to 0 04 for the complete cm 2006 sequence data not presented greenhouse calibration of crop n uptake considerably improved simulation of the seasonal values of soil mineral n in the calibration crops cm 2006 melon and pepper crops fig 1g no3 leaching was well simulated in melon and less effectively simulated in pepper this occurred despite the excellent simulation of drainage the errors associated with simulation of mineral soil n presumably contributed to the error in the simulation of no3 leaching 4 2 performance of the eu rotate n model in sequences of melon bare soil pepper under different water and n management eu rotate n accurately simulated dry matter production dmp crop n uptake and marketable fruit production in all treatments with errors that were lower or similar to those obtained in previous studies that evaluated eu rotate n in different cropping systems guo et al 2010 nendel et al 2012 rahn et al 2010 etc was very accurately simulated in the 2006 melon and pepper crops and the 2005 melon crops and was slightly overestimated in the 2005 pepper crops the overestimation in the 2005 pepper crops was presumably related to a high incidence of pepper vein mottling virus pvmv eu rotate n like all crop models assumes that crops are free of pests and diseases the leaf chlorosis caused by the virus probably affected photosynthetic capacity and crop transpiration the simulated dmp of the crop was not affected by the virus infection since the maximum dmp was used as the target dmp value however marketable fruit yield of the 2005 pepper was overestimated for both conventional and improved management by the model for the four sequences examined there was generally accurate simulation of drainage and etc throughout both the cm and im cropping sequences in 2006 there was accurate simulation of both drainage and etc throughout the cm and im melon crops and the bare soil period of the 2005 sequence drainage was accurately simulated the overestimation of drainage in the cm and im pepper crops of the 2005 sequence is attributable to the virus infection that was previously discussed with greenhouse grown tomato in soil soto et al 2014 reported adequate simulation of drainage with eu rotate n in nine of ten treatments to our knowledge there are no other published studies in which simulations of drainage by eu rotate n were compared with measured drainage eu rotate n very accurately simulated soil water content in the 0 30 and 30 60 cm soil layers other authors in different conditions have reported good performance of the model to simulate soil water content dynamics doltra and muñoz 2010 rahn et al 2010 soto et al 2014 sun et al 2012 soil mineral n was generally underestimated by eu rotate n in the current study the error being larger in the 2005 sequences and lower in the 2006 sequences however the model accurately simulated the seasonal trends of soil mineral n showing a sharp decrease in soil mineral n in the bare soil period between crops particularly in 2005 when the irrigations were much larger than in the equivalent period in 2006 the larger errors in the simulations of mineral n in the 2005 crops were probably due to the manure addition in 2003 which would have had more impact in 2005 than in 2006 manure addition is a common practice in this vegetable production system thompson et al 2007 other authors have reported underestimation of soil mineral n by eu rotate n that was attributed to underestimation of n mineralized from previously applications of organic material doltra and muñoz 2010 nendel et al 2012 moreover the eu rotate n coefficients of n mineralization for organic amendments were obtained in northern western european countries and may require adjustments for warmer climates doltra et al 2010 working in spain lidón et al 2011 and olasolo et al 2011 suggested that the n mineralization parameters of eu rotate n should be calibrated and validated for warmer conditions to enhance simulation of soil mineral n dynamics additionally the underestimation of soil mineral n in the 2005 crop sequences may be related to the reported reduced capacity of the model to accurately simulate soil mineral n under conditions of high soil mineral n several studies have observed that under high soil mineral n eu rotate n less accurately simulated soil mineral n doltra et al 2010 guo et al 2010 soto et al 2014 sun et al 2012 compared to drainage there was a general tendency to underestimate no3 leaching which was more pronounced in the 2005 pepper crops which suffered a notable virus infection soto et al 2014 reported that eu rotate n underestimated no3 leaching by 31 in tomato crops in the greenhouse system of se spain given that in the current study and in soto et al 2014 eu rotate n accurately simulated drainage and underestimated no3 leaching it is suggested that the appreciable underestimation of no3 leaching may be related to the apparent under estimation of n mineralization of manure n discussed previously there are no other published studies that compare simulated values of no3 leaching using eu rotate n to measured data in contrast numerous studies have used eu rotate n to estimate no3 leaching under different fertilizer treatments without previous validation de waele et al 2017 doltra and muñoz 2010 guo et al 2010 rahn et al 2010 sun et al 2012 in the bare soil period between crops in all four sequences eu rotate n accurately simulated the large and rapid increases in drainage and no3 leaching fig 3 that followed the large irrigations associated with salt leaching irrigation and chemical disinfection of soil the differences in the amounts of drainage and no3 leached between the two years is due to large irrigations applied in 2005 to both decrease and homogenize the soil no3 content for experimental purposes the volumes of the irrigations applied during the 2006 bare soil period are more representative of local farming practices these results are consistent with the observations of thompson et al 2007 that in this growing system large soil management irrigations in the between crop summer period can leach large amounts of mineral n that had accumulated during previous cropped periods direct comparison of simulations of the two treatments of the same crop with differences in irrigation and n management demonstrated the usefulness of eu rotate n to examine the effects of crop management on drainage no3 leaching and soil mineral n dynamics under mediterranean greenhouse conditions 5 conclusions compared to default values in situ calibration hereafter referred to as greenhouse calibration of some parameters related to crop growth the critical n curve and etc considerably improved the performance of eu rotate n for simulating crop n uptake and seasonal etc in melon and pepper compared to the default calibration the greenhouse calibration did not improve the simulation of dmp in both crops or the simulation of crop n uptake in pepper simulation of other parameters such as drainage no3 leaching and of both soil water and soil mineral n dynamics were considerably improved by the greenhouse calibration in general with the greenhouse calibration simulated values of dmp crop n uptake and etc were close to measured values with the slopes of linear regression between simulated and measured values being very close to 1 range of 0 95 1 08 and coefficients of determination r2 being 0 92 0 99 eu rotate n was able to simulate with reasonable accuracy marketable fresh fruit yield with an overestimate of 10 in the 2005 and 2006 melon crops and in the 2006 pepper crops in general eu rotate n provided acceptable simulation of drainage while no3 leaching was consistently underestimated eu rotate n overestimated etc and underestimated drainage in both the 2005 pepper cm and im treatments which was attributed to a virus infection the virus infection was also presumably a contributing factor to the relatively larger errors associated with the simulation of no3 leaching and of marketable fruit yield in these treatments during the period of bare soil between crops the performance of eu rotate n to simulate drainage was generally acceptable and no3 leaching was overestimated in all treatments eu rotate n accurately simulated the seasonal evolution of swc in the 0 30 and 30 60 cm soil layers simulation of soil mineral n in the 0 30 and 0 60 cm layers was slightly underestimated by the model in 2006 and appreciably underestimated in 2005 eu rotate n accurately simulated seasonal trends in soil mineral n in the four sequences examined in the four sequences eu rotate n was able to i simulate well the seasonal trends of drainage and no3 leaching during the cropping seasons and the periods of bare soil between crops and ii to simulate

11572,in this study a two year study in fields with and without a subsurface sand layer identified as fss and fns were conducted in the hetao irrigation district in northwest china to investigate the effects of irrigation lateral spacing and soil mulching on soil water and nitrate distribution uniformity and the combined effects of soil water and nitrate distribution on crop yield and water use efficiency wue of spring maize the experiment followed a completely randomized block design with four treatments s1m1 s1m2 s2m1 and s2m2 and three replicates for fss and fns respectively the four treatments resulted from the combination of two levels of lateral spacing s1 for 1 0 m and s2 for 0 5 m and two film covering modes full mulching m1 partial mulching m2 in each treatment the christiansen uniformity coefficient cu was used to evaluate the uniformities of soil water cuw and nitrate cun distribution in the vertical soil profile the results showed that the narrower lateral spacing and full mulching enhanced cun and relative chlorophyll content of leaf compared with the wider lateral spacing and partial mulching however lateral spacing and mulching methods imposed no significant effect on cuw the correlation between cuw and cun was not significant under mulched drip irrigation system in soils without a subsurface sand layer crop yield may be greater with a higher cun in root zone full film covering significantly enhanced cun and then increased crop yields and wue in fns however the combined effects of lateral spacing and mulching methods on grain yield were not significantly different thus taking into account crop yields wue and cost of drip laterals the combination of wider irrigation lateral spacing and partial mulching was recommended for the fss soil while the combination of wider irrigation lateral spacing and full mulching for the fns soil keywords soil water soil nitrate lateral spacing mulching christiansen uniformity coefficient 1 introduction the hetao irrigation district 40 19 41 18n 106 20 109 19e one of the three largest irrigation districts in china is located in the arid region of northwest of china climatic risks of cold spring season and extremely high evaporation precipitation ratio imposed great challenges on agricultural production thus plastic film mulching has been used in this area since the 1980s to sustain grain production soils in the hetao irrigation district were dominated by alluvial parent materials often coarse texture alluvial materials are overlain by 40 60 cm of medium textured soil some research found that this sand layer could retard soil water infiltration at the soil sand interface wang et al 2005 fan et al 2015 and others have observed finger flow occurring at such relatively fine over coarse interfaces under certain conditions causing soil water and solute losses below the root zone demirel and kavdir 2013 to mitigate these deep water and solute fluxes impermeable media such as polyethylene foil guber et al 2015 may be installed through a film bottomed tillage fbt method however fbt is costly and causes a high degree of soil disturbance which may degrade the soil miura et al 2008 based on the above reasons mulched drip irrigation has been gradually adopted as a water saving wang et al 2014 practice in this agriculture system in recent years mulched drip irrigation is widely applied in arid regions and sandy fields which can achieve precise applications of water and fertilizer to the root zone while decreasing evaporation chakraborty et al 2008 el hendawy and schmidhalter 2010 however precise applications cannot guarantee an efficient use by crops bozkurt et al 2006 drip irrigation combined with mulching resulted in a localized wetting zone that could lead to excessive growth of crop canopy potentially resulting in crop water stress during the reproductive stage even under high soil water contents li et al 1999 in addition large differences in soil water content between the wetted soil zone and the rest of the soil may effectively limit the volume of soil plant roots occupy because of localized concentrations of soil water and nitrate li et al 2009 2010 layout and spacing of drip irrigation laterals has been shown to influence the distribution of soil water content and nitrate yield formation and net profits in dripped irrigation systems closer lateral spacing usually gives a greater horizontal water content distribution uniformity crop yield and water use efficiency wue bozkurt et al 2006 chen et al 2010 chen et al 2015 however closer lateral spacing increases costs and means lower net profits bosch et al 1998 chen et al 2015 compared with partial plastic film mulch li et al 2010 found that full mulching increased soil water storage within the 0 200 cm soil depth from the sowing to jointing stage but decreased soil water storage 0 200 cm from the jointing to the filling stage full plastic film mulch more profoundly enhances crop establishment chalker scott 2007 and the amount of nitrogen accumulation in the maize kernel zhang 2011 resulting in a higher hundred grain weight kunzová and hejcman 2009 compared to crops produced under a partial plastic film mulch ramakrishna et al 2006 the variation in nitrate concentration around roots can instantaneously influence root hydraulic properties which lead to more root extraction of soil water from the nitrate rich patch gorska et al 2008 as a result soil water and nitrate often show a coupling effect on crop yield zotarelli et al 2009 fang et al 2013 therefore we hypothesize that the distribution uniformity of soil water and nitrate may be as influential as the contents of soil water and nitrogen on crop yield however previous studies have focused on the coupling effect of soil water content and nitrate concentration on crop yield rather than the distribution uniformities of soil water and nitrate the christiansen uniformity coefficient cu ranging between 0 very low uniformity and 1 very high uniformity is normally used to evaluate surface soil water content distribution allaire leung et al 2001 wang et al 2013 for drip or sprinkler irrigation system some studies have found a dependent relationship between crop yield and irrigation uniformity montovani et al 1995 zhao et al 2012 but this relationship was not observed in the studies of mateos et al 1997 and bordovsky and porter 2008 in this study cu was used in another way to characterize soil water and nitrate distributions in root zone kang et al 2000 analyzed the effect of cuw on crop yield and water use efficiency wue soil no3 n is commonly less uniform than soil water content cook and sanders 1990 our previous study investigated the cuw cun and root distribution of spring maize under different levels of lateral spacing and soil mulching methods in a subsurface sand layer soil zhou et al 2017 however the combined effects of cun and cuw on crop yield have not been fully investigated in this study we selected two typical fields with and without a subsurface sand layer beneath the root zone identified as fss and fns the objectives were 1 to investigate the combined effects of lateral spacing and film covering method on the cuw cun and the correlation between cuw and cun cuwn and 2 to explore the relationship between spring maize yield and cuw cun and cuwn in the two types of fields 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and climatic conditions the field experiments were conducted in 2015 and 2016 at the shuguang irrigation research station 40 43n 107 13e 1042 m asl located in the hetao irrigation district the inner mongolia autonomous region of china this region has an arid continental climate with an average annual rainfall of 135 mm and mean annual pan evaporation of 2350 mm the mean annual air temperature was 9 1 c and daily average air temperature from 23 76 c in july to 10 08 c in january there are 135 150 frost free days and 3100 3300 sunshine hours per year the distance and elevation difference of the two type of fields involved a field with a subsurface sand layer at 60 90 cm depth fss and a field with no subsurface sand layer fns were 300 m and 0 20 m within the standard 2 km for horizontal distance and 100 m for elevation difference to use the same set of meteorological data china meteorological administration 2003 the main soil physical and chemical properties in the root zone 0 120 cm depth of the two types of fields of fss and fns were listed in table 1 climatic data during the two growing seasons showed low air temperature and precipitation in 2015 fig 1 2 2 experimental design and field management this experiment followed a completely randomized block design with four treatments and three replicates each plot was 4 m 12 m and had eight plant rows two typical fields with and without a subsurface sand layer fss and fns were selected in this study there were a total of 24 plots and 12 plots for each type of field with four treatments and 3 replicates in this study the four treatments were resulted from the combination of two levels of lateral spacing 1 0 m s1 0 5 m s2 and two film covering modes full mulching m1 partial mulching m2 in the treatments related to s1 one drip lateral was laid on the surface centered between corn rows with full plastic film mulching s1m1 or partially mulched with an effective width of 60 cm s1m2 in the treatments related to s2 laterals were placed close to the crop row combined with full plastic film mulching s2m1 or partially mulched with an effective width of 30 cm s2m2 fig 2 a the clear plastic film in all treatments was 8 μm thick polyethylene the drip irrigation systems consisting of a control unit and distribution lines were set up prior to plastic mulch application the control unit of the irrigation system consisted of control valves a pressure gauge and a water flow meter the drip tape ø 16 mm with emitters spaced at 30 cm had a flow rate of 1 4 l h at an operating pressure of 0 04 mpa irrigation applications were 346 1 and 223 9 mm in 2015 and 2016 respectively which were based on an evaporative demand measured with an evaporation pan daily pan evaporation was determined at 8 00 am each day from a pan 20 cm in diameter located on a grassland surrounded by fallow soils before elongation stage irrigation was just applied at v6 stage in both years after elongation stage maize was irrigated every 3 days and each irrigation depth was determined by summed pan evaporation in the latest 3 days the total n application rate was 300 kg n ha in both years a mixture of urea 75 kg n ha and ammonium phosphate 75 kg n ha was broadcasted as base fertilizer in both years while the remained fertilizer was applied after the six leaf stage v6 every three days through fertigation using a liquamatic piston fertilizer pump mixrite 2504h tefen israel clear plastic film mulch was installed on 26 april then maize was sowed on 28 april in both years seeds of maize cultivar ximeng 6 were sown hole by hole using a manual hole sowing machine at 5 cm depth with a planting density of 66 600 plants ha herbicide was sprayed on soil surface in non mulched areas to eliminated weeds during the growing season 2 3 sampling and measurement soil water content was measured hourly at soil depths of 10 30 50 80 and 110 cm with the ech2o 5te soil moisture sensors decagon devices inc pullman wa usa and then averaged as daily value the sensors were installed at a point about one fourth of the total distance between two adjacent laterals and at the middle of the planting rows in the horizontal position fig 2b ech2o 5te sensors are capacitance sensors that take advantage of high permittivity of water and calculate the apparent moist soil dielectric constant or relative permittivity the calibrated empirical equations between volumetric soil water content and relative permittivity for each sensor and specific soil texture were established according to the instruction manual before inserted into soil profile one measurement site was dug at the center of each plot in order to minimize soil profile and structure disturbance soil was vertically excavated layer by layer at 10 cm intervals excavated soil from each layer was separately placed and then backfilled in turn after all sensors installed data were collected hourly with automatic data loggers em50 decagon devices inc pullman wa usa soil no3 n concentration was measured on soil samples taken at 0 1 m intervals to a depth of 1 m at the same horizontal distances from the laterals for soil water content measurement samples for soil no3 n analysis were taken seven days after irrigation before the elongation stage during frequent fertigation periods from elongation to dough stage samples were taken every three weeks soil samples were extracted with 1 m kcl 10 g of air dried soil 100 ml of kcl and analyzed with an aa3 continuous flow analytical system aa3 seal germany relative chlorophyll content was measured using spad 502 minolta camera co osaka japan at v10 and r1 stages measurements of chlorophyll content were made in the middle node of expanding leaves from ten plants in each plot grain yield was determined by harvesting the two adjacent center rows in each plot at maturity the grain was sun dried for 4 5 days and weighed the kernel number per ear was then counted and grain yield of maize was determined by assuming a water content of 15 in the sun dried grain 2 3 1 uniformity calculations and data analysis the christiansen uniformity coefficient of soil water content cuw or no3 n cun in the entire soil profile was used to evaluate the uniformity of soil water or no3 distribution kang et al 2000 the soil profile used for cu calculations extended from the emitters to the middle of planting rows horizontally and from soil surface to 60 cm depth vertically the cu for soil moisture was calculated as follows 1 c u w 1 i 1 n θ i θ n θ 2 θ i 1 n θ i n where cuw is the soil water uniformity coefficient in 0 60 cm soil depth ranging between 0 very low uniformity and 1 very high uniformity θ is the average soil water content in the entire soil profile in 0 60 cm soil depth cm3 cm3 θi is the observed water content for the i th grid cm3 cm3 and n is the total number of grids for cuw calculation which was 9 in each profile in this study consisting of three horizontal points and three vertical depths of 10 30 and 50 cm fig 2 cun was also calculated with eqs 1 and 2 using soil no3 n concentrations in place of soil water contents the total water consumption evapotranspiration or et mm can be calculated based on the water balance formula 3 e t δ w p i g r d where δw is the change in soil water storage mm p and i are precipitation mm and irrigation mm respectively g is contribution from the water table mm r is surface runoff mm and d is deep drainage mm the depth of the root zone was defined as 0 120 cm and 0 60 cm in fns and fss respectively zhou et al 2017 g was assumed to be negligible because the distance between water table and the bottom of the root zone was over 1 m allen et al 1998 the water table fluctuated between 2 3 2 8 m during crop growth stage and the distance between water table and the bottom of the root zone was 1 7 2 2 m and 1 1 1 6 m in fss and fns respectively in fss the large pores in the sand layer can block capillary rise and groundwater recharge shi et al 2006 in fns a local flux method in which two tensiometers were closely installed into soil at 110 cm and 130 cm depth was used to measure the magnitude and direction of the hydraulic gradient wang et al 2014 the water potential variations in the five monitoring points of which four were distributed in the corners and one in the center of the fns field showed no groundwater discharge occurred r was also assumed to be negligible as the field was flat and there was no observed runoff of irrigation water if available water in the root zone and the total amount of applied water by irrigation were above the field capacity d was estimated as the amount of water above field capacity after an irrigation event or a heavy rainfall allen et al 1998 the soil water content at the bottom of the root zone 40 60 cm in fss and 100 120 cm in fns did not exceed field capacity 30 1 and 30 8 cm3 cm3 in fss and fns respectively thus d can also be neglected in fns however the increase of soil water content in the sand layer 60 90 cm and the soil layer below 90 120 cm in fss may be attributed to preferential flow i e finger flow which may occur at the soil sand interface although the soil water content at bottom of the root zone did not exceed field capacity thus eq 3 can be simplified as follows 4 e t δ w p i d the water use efficiency wue kg m3 was calculated as the grain yield y kg m2 divided by et m 5 w u e y i e l d e t data were analyzed for anova and factor analysis with the spss software multiple comparisons of mean values were made with duncan s multiple range tests at a significance level of 0 05 a correlation matrix gained by factor analysis was used to investigate the correlation between crop yield soil water content soil no3 n concentration cuw and cun 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil water content and christiansen uniformity coefficient cuw frequent fertigation maintained the soil water content of 0 60 cm layer above 60 of the field capacity 0 2 cm3 cm3 before 110 days after sowing das except for the s1m1 treatment fig 3 a so all treatments met water requirement of maize except for the s1m1 treatment fig 3 after the late r5 stage 115 das soil water content decreased rapidly and crop water stress occurred in s1 treatments in 2015 fig 3a b because frequent fertigation ceased a previous study found that irrigation every three days can meet water requirement of maize in a sandy soil el hendawy and schmidhalter 2010 however rainfall was low in 2015 in this study area about 14 62 mm while transpiration demands of maize can commonly exceed 10 mm per day in elongation and silking stages zhang and cong 2016 furthermore in s1 treatments large laterals spacing caused extremely low soil water content 0 15 cm3 cm3 under the wide planting rows similar to the observations of chen et al 2015 compared to partially mulched spring maize full mulched spring maize showed a higher biomass and soil water consumption thus easily causing a soil water deficit li et al 1999 the cuw fluctuation basically coincided with soil water content following a slight time lag frequent irrigation not only increased soil water content but also enhanced cuw fig 3a d which was also observed by zai et al 2009 the frequent irrigations in this study maintained the cuw above 0 7 fig 3a d however cuw in s2m1 in fss decreased to 0 6 during frequent fertigation in the 2016 growing season between 72 das to 119 das fig 3c but this was not observed in fns relative soil water contents rsw ranging from 0 to 1 were calculated by defining the highest soil water content as 1 in each treatment and the spatial distribution of rsw in the root zone is presented in fig 4 very high or very low rsw could all lead to a lower cuw the s2m1 treatment in fss showed a large low rsw zone rsw was lower than 0 7 at 30 40 cm depth under emitters and 50 60 cm depth fig 4g which was not showed in other treatments fig 4a f h the three way anova results showed that lateral spacings mulching methods and soil types imposed no significant effects on soil water content table 2 while a narrow lateral spacing s2 caused a significant higher cuw 4 43 p 0 05 than that of with a wide lateral spacing s1 the effect of lateral spacing on soil water content was just significant when lateral spacing was wide enough i e more than 1 5 m bozkurt et al 2006 while it was not significant when lateral spacing is narrow chen et al 2015 table 2 it was mainly because wide lateral spacing means an emitter must wet a large area and requires large water application volumes from each emitter which may result in deep losses of irrigation water however this study confirmed that a narrow lateral spacing led to a higher cuw due to more overlapping areas of the neighbouring wetting zones bozkurt et al 2006 zai et al 2009 under drip irrigation with no runoff and limited deep percolation mulching regulated soil water content by a combined effect of soil evaporation and crop respiration full mulching reduced soil evaporation completely while easily enhanced biomass aboveground and crop respiration and easily caused more soil water storage from the sowing to elongation stage due to complete evaporation reduction but led to lower soil water storage after the elongation stage due to higher crop biomass and respiration in our study soil water content was not significantly different between full mulching and partial mulching condition because full mulching caused higher crop biomass and respiration before elongation stage which diminished the effect of more soil evaporation reduction compared with partial mulching condition after elongation stage the leaf area would reach to the maximum platform value laimax allen et al 1998 and led to no significant difference of soil evaporation and crop respiration under different mulching conditions the soil type subsurface sand layer played no significant effects on soil water distribution mainly because of the low total irrigation amounts 346 1 and 223 9 mm in 2015 and 2016 respectively and the limited deep percolation table 4 in this study compared with the irrigation amounts of study of bozkurt et al 2006 550 750 mm and chen et al 2015 300 750 mm 3 2 soil no3 n concentrations and christiansen uniformity coefficient cun soil no3 n deficit 15 mg kg rarely occurred in all treatments mainly due to the frequent n fertigation after the jointing stage fig 5 soil no3 n concentrations increased steadily but cun increased first and then decreased during frequent fertigation fig 5 it was observed that cun tended to decrease sharply with frequent fertigation when soil no3 n concentration exceeded 50 mg kg this may be attributed to the local extreme high soil no3 n concentration exceeds 100 mg kg among the observed points due to the frequent fertigation in addition the subsurface sand layer may have retard downward movement of soil water and no3 n at soil sand interface which maybe was another reason for a more drastic cun decrease in fss wang et al 2005 fan et al 2015 because of a large initial variation of soil no3 n concentrations in all treatments fig 5 relative variation of soil no3 n concentrations rv snc and cun rv cun during the entire crop grow stage were analyzed for three way anova table 3 the narrow lateral spacing s2 caused both significantly higher rv snc 3 38 mg kg 1 p 0 01 and rv cun 4 22 p 0 01 than that with a wide lateral spacing s1 this is because wider lateral spacing s1 caused a lower cuw in 0 20 cm soil layer p 0 05 table 2 thus easily causing more soil nitrate leaching pang et al 1997 wang et al 2013 the narrow lateral spacing helped the base fertilizer dissolve more evenly into soil wang et al 2013 after the first fertigation at v6 stage furthermore during the frequent fertigation a narrow lateral spacing helped fertilizer solute distribute uniformly in the whole root zone in soil with a medium or clay texture li et al 2009 thus avoiding the extreme high soil no3 n concentration the full mulching methods m1 caused significantly higher rv cun 5 34 p 0 01 than partial mulching treatments m2 table 3 compared with full mulched condition soil patch with quite high soil no3 concentration was showed in un mulched zone due to the lateral movement and a redistribution of soil nitrate from the higher water potential area mulched zone to the lower water potential zone un mulched zone within the soil matrix in root zone 3 3 correlation between cuw and cun cuwn the correlation between cuw and cun cuwn was analyzed to investigate the fluctuation consistency of cuw and cun in various treatments the cuwn was not significant in all treatments fig 6 gorska et al 2008 found that the no3 n concentration influences root hydraulic properties around roots which lead to more soil water absorption from the nitrate rich patch thus showing a coupling effect on crop yield zotarelli et al 2009 so soil water regime is commonly regarded closely tied with soil no3 n distribution montovani et al 1995 li 1998 however cuwn was not significant in all mulched drip irrigation treatment this is mainly because that soil no3 n distribution pattern was different from that of soil water the wetted zone extended gradually from the infiltration source afterward soil water redistributed according to the soil water potential however soil no3 n distribution pattern was significantly affected by soil texture the highest concentration of no3 n was commonly observed in the areas most distant from the drip tube in a coarse texture soil while soil no3 n concentrations were uniform throughout the bed in a fine texture soil cook and sanders 1990 li et al 2009 3 4 et yield and wue in 2016 the estimated et was lower than in 2015 table 4 this is likely a result of the lower temperature lower wind speed and higher air humidity in 2016 manifested as lower cumulative pan evaporation the deep drainage d eq 4 in 2016 was greater than that of in 2015 it may due to the high rain fall amounts sweeney et al 2012 it indicates that deep percolation easily occurred when summing 3 day water surface evaporation values of e20 pan for irrigation amount design plants in fns showed higher et 3 3 p 0 01 tables 4 and 6 because roots penetrated to 120 cm depth compared with a depth of 60 cm in fss which is beneficial for crop soil water absorption et of plants in s2 was 4 8 higher p 0 01 tables 4 and 6 than s1 treatments due to a better soil water supply table 2 which was also reported in the study of bozkurt et al 2006 mulching methods showed no significant effect on et table 6 p 0 05 the relationship between wue and grain yield were always linear unless the irrigation frequency was too high i e once in 1 day el hendawy and schmidhalter 2010 so yields in fns was 6 5 higher tables 5 and 6 p 0 01 than fss treatments due to a higher et yields in s2 and m1 treatments were 3 0 and 6 7 higher than that of in s1 and m2 tables 5 and 6 p 0 01 due to a higher grain numbers per plant 4 6 p 0 05 in s2 treatments and higher seedling emergence rate 8 6 p 0 05 in m1 treatments compared with that of in s1 treatments and m2 treatments respectively soil type fns and fss both enhanced et and yield and had no significant effect on water use efficiency wue wue in m1 treatments were 5 1 higher than m2 treatments tables 5 and 6 p 0 01 especially in fns table 5 due to a higher yield and no significant different grain yield table 5 wue in s2 treatments were 7 2 higher than s1 treatments tables 5 and 6 p 0 01 the effect of lateral spacing on yield and wue were influenced by irrigation amounts under high irrigation amounts i e 550 700 mm grain yield and wue first increased and then decreased as the lateral spacing increased which showed a higher yield and under lateral spacing of 1 5 m than that of under 0 7 m and 2 1 m under low irrigation amounts i e 300 mm grain yield and wue were decreased as the lateral spacing increased 3 5 correlation between yield with soil water content soil no3 n concentration and et crop yields showed close correlation with soil water content soil no3 n concentrations snc and cun in fns table 7 however in fss crop yields showed close correlation with soil water content and soil no3 n concentration it was because cun may enhance root distribution root activity luo et al 2013 dodd 2005 and grain filling duration rajcan and tollenaar 1999 which is more important to yield formation than soil water content and no3 n concentrations under no water and nitrate stress condition during reproductive stage from 109 das to 120 das in both years however in fss root penetration was restricted and root shoot ratio was affected by the subsurface sand layer so the effect of cun on shoot and root growth and yield formation may weaken correspondingly in addition the previous studies showed that leaf n content and crop photosynthesis can be reflected by relative chlorophyll content which is commonly evaluated by spad readings hawkins et al 2007 interestingly instead of soil nitrate our study showed that plants under full mulching m1 combined with narrower lateral spacing s2 showed a highest spad readings fig 7 which was in accord with the results of cun averaged value of the entire grow period this may be due to the root distribution and soil water and nitrate absorption regulation by wetted zone under drip fertigation system compared with border irrigation system clothier and sauer 1988 tsutsumi et al 2003 yield showed a negative relationship with δw and et in both fields table 7 which was commonly reported in treatments with excess irrigation amounts that beyond crop requirement kang et al 2002 el hendawy and schmidhalter 2010 it was due to that values of e20 pan can not reflect crop transpiration which is an important component of et this also indicates that although e20 pan provides an easier way to guide irrigation it can be not considered when guiding irrigation by field capacity since its availability is affect by meteorological condition i e precipitation difference between 2015 and 2016 the three way anova table table 6 showed a narrower lateral spacing s2 or full mulching m1 can enhanced crop yield however the results of multiple comparisons showed that grain yields between s1 and s2 treatments were not significantly different table 5 p 0 05 a drip irrigation system with higher cuw and cun i e s2m1 treatment usually represents a higher initial installation cost lamm et al 1997 so based on yield and wue wider irrigation lateral spacing and partial mulching was recommended in fss and wider irrigation lateral spacing and full mulching in fns 4 conclusions in this study the performances and water use efficiency of spring maize were evaluated under different mulching and lateral spacing methods of drip irrigation in the hetao irrigation district in china mainly considering the distribution uniformity of water cuw and no3 n cun the results showed that correlations between cuw and cun cuwn were not significant under mulched drip irrigation system the christiansen uniformity coefficients of soil no3 n concentration cun were positive correlated with grain yields in fns narrower lateral spacing s2 and full mulching m1 could enhanced cun relative chlorophyll content of leaf and crop yield compared with wider lateral spacing s1 and partial mulching m2 respectively however the combined effects of lateral spacings and mulching methods on grain yield were not significantly different full mulching significant enhanced cun thus increasing crop yields and wue in fns so based on crop yields wue and cost of drip lateral the treatment of s1m2 was recommended in fss while s1m1 in fns to reduce the possibility of too high level of n in the micro zone beneath drip emitter which occurred in this study and increase soil cun and crop yield rational application rates and intervals of n fertilizer under mulched drip irrigation deserve further studies acknowledgements this

11572,in this study a two year study in fields with and without a subsurface sand layer identified as fss and fns were conducted in the hetao irrigation district in northwest china to investigate the effects of irrigation lateral spacing and soil mulching on soil water and nitrate distribution uniformity and the combined effects of soil water and nitrate distribution on crop yield and water use efficiency wue of spring maize the experiment followed a completely randomized block design with four treatments s1m1 s1m2 s2m1 and s2m2 and three replicates for fss and fns respectively the four treatments resulted from the combination of two levels of lateral spacing s1 for 1 0 m and s2 for 0 5 m and two film covering modes full mulching m1 partial mulching m2 in each treatment the christiansen uniformity coefficient cu was used to evaluate the uniformities of soil water cuw and nitrate cun distribution in the vertical soil profile the results showed that the narrower lateral spacing and full mulching enhanced cun and relative chlorophyll content of leaf compared with the wider lateral spacing and partial mulching however lateral spacing and mulching methods imposed no significant effect on cuw the correlation between cuw and cun was not significant under mulched drip irrigation system in soils without a subsurface sand layer crop yield may be greater with a higher cun in root zone full film covering significantly enhanced cun and then increased crop yields and wue in fns however the combined effects of lateral spacing and mulching methods on grain yield were not significantly different thus taking into account crop yields wue and cost of drip laterals the combination of wider irrigation lateral spacing and partial mulching was recommended for the fss soil

introduction the hetao irrigation district 40 19 41 18n 106 20 109 19e one of the three largest irrigation districts in china is located in the arid region of northwest of china climatic risks of cold spring season and extremely high evaporation precipitation ratio imposed great challenges on agricultural production thus plastic film mulching has been used in this area since the 1980s to sustain grain production soils in the hetao irrigation district were dominated by alluvial parent materials often coarse texture alluvial materials are overlain by 40 60 cm of medium textured soil some research found that this sand layer could retard soil water infiltration at the soil sand interface wang et al 2005 fan et al 2015 and others have observed finger flow occurring at such relatively fine over coarse interfaces under certain conditions causing soil water and solute losses below the root zone demirel and kavdir 2013 to mitigate these deep water and solute fluxes impermeable media such as polyethylene foil guber et al 2015 may be installed through a film bottomed tillage fbt method however fbt is costly and causes a high degree of soil disturbance which may degrade the soil miura et al 2008 based on the above reasons mulched drip irrigation has been gradually adopted as a water saving wang et al 2014 practice in this agriculture system in recent years mulched drip irrigation is widely applied in arid regions and sandy fields which can achieve precise applications of water and fertilizer to the root zone while decreasing evaporation chakraborty et al 2008 el hendawy and schmidhalter 2010 however precise applications cannot guarantee an efficient use by crops bozkurt et al 2006 drip irrigation combined with mulching resulted in a localized wetting zone that could lead to excessive growth of crop canopy potentially resulting in crop water stress during the reproductive stage even under high soil water contents li et al 1999 in addition large differences in soil water content between the wetted soil zone and the rest of the soil may effectively limit the volume of soil plant roots occupy because of localized concentrations of soil water and nitrate li et al 2009 2010 layout and spacing of drip irrigation laterals has been shown to influence the distribution of soil water content and nitrate yield formation and net profits in dripped irrigation systems closer lateral spacing usually gives a greater horizontal water content distribution uniformity crop yield and water use efficiency wue bozkurt et al 2006 chen et al 2010 chen et al 2015 however closer lateral spacing increases costs and means lower net profits bosch et al 1998 chen et al 2015 compared with partial plastic film mulch li et al 2010 found that full mulching increased soil water storage within the 0 200 cm soil depth from the sowing to jointing stage but decreased soil water storage 0 200 cm from the jointing to the filling stage full plastic film mulch more profoundly enhances crop establishment chalker scott 2007 and the amount of nitrogen accumulation in the maize kernel zhang 2011 resulting in a higher hundred grain weight kunzová and hejcman 2009 compared to crops produced under a partial plastic film mulch ramakrishna et al 2006 the variation in nitrate concentration around roots can instantaneously influence root hydraulic properties which lead to more root extraction of soil water from the nitrate rich patch gorska et al 2008 as a result soil water and nitrate often show a coupling effect on crop yield zotarelli et al 2009 fang et al 2013 therefore we hypothesize that the distribution uniformity of soil water and nitrate may be as influential as the contents of soil water and nitrogen on crop yield however previous studies have focused on the coupling effect of soil water content and nitrate concentration on crop yield rather than the distribution uniformities of soil water and nitrate the christiansen uniformity coefficient cu ranging between 0 very low uniformity and 1 very high uniformity is normally used to evaluate surface soil water content distribution allaire leung et al 2001 wang et al 2013 for drip or sprinkler irrigation system some studies have found a dependent relationship between crop yield and irrigation uniformity montovani et al 1995 zhao et al 2012 but this relationship was not observed in the studies of mateos et al 1997 and bordovsky and porter 2008 in this study cu was used in another way to characterize soil water and nitrate distributions in root zone kang et al 2000 analyzed the effect of cuw on crop yield and water use efficiency wue soil no3 n is commonly less uniform than soil water content cook and sanders 1990 our previous study investigated the cuw cun and root distribution of spring maize under different levels of lateral spacing and soil mulching methods in a subsurface sand layer soil zhou et al 2017 however the combined effects of cun and cuw on crop yield have not been fully investigated in this study we selected two typical fields with and without a subsurface sand layer beneath the root zone identified as fss and fns the objectives were 1 to investigate the combined effects of lateral spacing and film covering method on the cuw cun and the correlation between cuw and cun cuwn and 2 to explore the relationship between spring maize yield and cuw cun and cuwn in the two types of fields 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and climatic conditions the field experiments were conducted in 2015 and 2016 at the shuguang irrigation research station 40 43n 107 13e 1042 m asl located in the hetao irrigation district the inner mongolia autonomous region of china this region has an arid continental climate with an average annual rainfall of 135 mm and mean annual pan evaporation of 2350 mm the mean annual air temperature was 9 1 c and daily average air temperature from 23 76 c in july to 10 08 c in january there are 135 150 frost free days and 3100 3300 sunshine hours per year the distance and elevation difference of the two type of fields involved a field with a subsurface sand layer at 60 90 cm depth fss and a field with no subsurface sand layer fns were 300 m and 0 20 m within the standard 2 km for horizontal distance and 100 m for elevation difference to use the same set of meteorological data china meteorological administration 2003 the main soil physical and chemical properties in the root zone 0 120 cm depth of the two types of fields of fss and fns were listed in table 1 climatic data during the two growing seasons showed low air temperature and precipitation in 2015 fig 1 2 2 experimental design and field management this experiment followed a completely randomized block design with four treatments and three replicates each plot was 4 m 12 m and had eight plant rows two typical fields with and without a subsurface sand layer fss and fns were selected in this study there were a total of 24 plots and 12 plots for each type of field with four treatments and 3 replicates in this study the four treatments were resulted from the combination of two levels of lateral spacing 1 0 m s1 0 5 m s2 and two film covering modes full mulching m1 partial mulching m2 in the treatments related to s1 one drip lateral was laid on the surface centered between corn rows with full plastic film mulching s1m1 or partially mulched with an effective width of 60 cm s1m2 in the treatments related to s2 laterals were placed close to the crop row combined with full plastic film mulching s2m1 or partially mulched with an effective width of 30 cm s2m2 fig 2 a the clear plastic film in all treatments was 8 μm thick polyethylene the drip irrigation systems consisting of a control unit and distribution lines were set up prior to plastic mulch application the control unit of the irrigation system consisted of control valves a pressure gauge and a water flow meter the drip tape ø 16 mm with emitters spaced at 30 cm had a flow rate of 1 4 l h at an operating pressure of 0 04 mpa irrigation applications were 346 1 and 223 9 mm in 2015 and 2016 respectively which were based on an evaporative demand measured with an evaporation pan daily pan evaporation was determined at 8 00 am each day from a pan 20 cm in diameter located on a grassland surrounded by fallow soils before elongation stage irrigation was just applied at v6 stage in both years after elongation stage maize was irrigated every 3 days and each irrigation depth was determined by summed pan evaporation in the latest 3 days the total n application rate was 300 kg n ha in both years a mixture of urea 75 kg n ha and ammonium phosphate 75 kg n ha was broadcasted as base fertilizer in both years while the remained fertilizer was applied after the six leaf stage v6 every three days through fertigation using a liquamatic piston fertilizer pump mixrite 2504h tefen israel clear plastic film mulch was installed on 26 april then maize was sowed on 28 april in both years seeds of maize cultivar ximeng 6 were sown hole by hole using a manual hole sowing machine at 5 cm depth with a planting density of 66 600 plants ha herbicide was sprayed on soil surface in non mulched areas to eliminated weeds during the growing season 2 3 sampling and measurement soil water content was measured hourly at soil depths of 10 30 50 80 and 110 cm with the ech2o 5te soil moisture sensors decagon devices inc pullman wa usa and then averaged as daily value the sensors were installed at a point about one fourth of the total distance between two adjacent laterals and at the middle of the planting rows in the horizontal position fig 2b ech2o 5te sensors are capacitance sensors that take advantage of high permittivity of water and calculate the apparent moist soil dielectric constant or relative permittivity the calibrated empirical equations between volumetric soil water content and relative permittivity for each sensor and specific soil texture were established according to the instruction manual before inserted into soil profile one measurement site was dug at the center of each plot in order to minimize soil profile and structure disturbance soil was vertically excavated layer by layer at 10 cm intervals excavated soil from each layer was separately placed and then backfilled in turn after all sensors installed data were collected hourly with automatic data loggers em50 decagon devices inc pullman wa usa soil no3 n concentration was measured on soil samples taken at 0 1 m intervals to a depth of 1 m at the same horizontal distances from the laterals for soil water content measurement samples for soil no3 n analysis were taken seven days after irrigation before the elongation stage during frequent fertigation periods from elongation to dough stage samples were taken every three weeks soil samples were extracted with 1 m kcl 10 g of air dried soil 100 ml of kcl and analyzed with an aa3 continuous flow analytical system aa3 seal germany relative chlorophyll content was measured using spad 502 minolta camera co osaka japan at v10 and r1 stages measurements of chlorophyll content were made in the middle node of expanding leaves from ten plants in each plot grain yield was determined by harvesting the two adjacent center rows in each plot at maturity the grain was sun dried for 4 5 days and weighed the kernel number per ear was then counted and grain yield of maize was determined by assuming a water content of 15 in the sun dried grain 2 3 1 uniformity calculations and data analysis the christiansen uniformity coefficient of soil water content cuw or no3 n cun in the entire soil profile was used to evaluate the uniformity of soil water or no3 distribution kang et al 2000 the soil profile used for cu calculations extended from the emitters to the middle of planting rows horizontally and from soil surface to 60 cm depth vertically the cu for soil moisture was calculated as follows 1 c u w 1 i 1 n θ i θ n θ 2 θ i 1 n θ i n where cuw is the soil water uniformity coefficient in 0 60 cm soil depth ranging between 0 very low uniformity and 1 very high uniformity θ is the average soil water content in the entire soil profile in 0 60 cm soil depth cm3 cm3 θi is the observed water content for the i th grid cm3 cm3 and n is the total number of grids for cuw calculation which was 9 in each profile in this study consisting of three horizontal points and three vertical depths of 10 30 and 50 cm fig 2 cun was also calculated with eqs 1 and 2 using soil no3 n concentrations in place of soil water contents the total water consumption evapotranspiration or et mm can be calculated based on the water balance formula 3 e t δ w p i g r d where δw is the change in soil water storage mm p and i are precipitation mm and irrigation mm respectively g is contribution from the water table mm r is surface runoff mm and d is deep drainage mm the depth of the root zone was defined as 0 120 cm and 0 60 cm in fns and fss respectively zhou et al 2017 g was assumed to be negligible because the distance between water table and the bottom of the root zone was over 1 m allen et al 1998 the water table fluctuated between 2 3 2 8 m during crop growth stage and the distance between water table and the bottom of the root zone was 1 7 2 2 m and 1 1 1 6 m in fss and fns respectively in fss the large pores in the sand layer can block capillary rise and groundwater recharge shi et al 2006 in fns a local flux method in which two tensiometers were closely installed into soil at 110 cm and 130 cm depth was used to measure the magnitude and direction of the hydraulic gradient wang et al 2014 the water potential variations in the five monitoring points of which four were distributed in the corners and one in the center of the fns field showed no groundwater discharge occurred r was also assumed to be negligible as the field was flat and there was no observed runoff of irrigation water if available water in the root zone and the total amount of applied water by irrigation were above the field capacity d was estimated as the amount of water above field capacity after an irrigation event or a heavy rainfall allen et al 1998 the soil water content at the bottom of the root zone 40 60 cm in fss and 100 120 cm in fns did not exceed field capacity 30 1 and 30 8 cm3 cm3 in fss and fns respectively thus d can also be neglected in fns however the increase of soil water content in the sand layer 60 90 cm and the soil layer below 90 120 cm in fss may be attributed to preferential flow i e finger flow which may occur at the soil sand interface although the soil water content at bottom of the root zone did not exceed field capacity thus eq 3 can be simplified as follows 4 e t δ w p i d the water use efficiency wue kg m3 was calculated as the grain yield y kg m2 divided by et m 5 w u e y i e l d e t data were analyzed for anova and factor analysis with the spss software multiple comparisons of mean values were made with duncan s multiple range tests at a significance level of 0 05 a correlation matrix gained by factor analysis was used to investigate the correlation between crop yield soil water content soil no3 n concentration cuw and cun 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil water content and christiansen uniformity coefficient cuw frequent fertigation maintained the soil water content of 0 60 cm layer above 60 of the field capacity 0 2 cm3 cm3 before 110 days after sowing das except for the s1m1 treatment fig 3 a so all treatments met water requirement of maize except for the s1m1 treatment fig 3 after the late r5 stage 115 das soil water content decreased rapidly and crop water stress occurred in s1 treatments in 2015 fig 3a b because frequent fertigation ceased a previous study found that irrigation every three days can meet water requirement of maize in a sandy soil el hendawy and schmidhalter 2010 however rainfall was low in 2015 in this study area about 14 62 mm while transpiration demands of maize can commonly exceed 10 mm per day in elongation and silking stages zhang and cong 2016 furthermore in s1 treatments large laterals spacing caused extremely low soil water content 0 15 cm3 cm3 under the wide planting rows similar to the observations of chen et al 2015 compared to partially mulched spring maize full mulched spring maize showed a higher biomass and soil water consumption thus easily causing a soil water deficit li et al 1999 the cuw fluctuation basically coincided with soil water content following a slight time lag frequent irrigation not only increased soil water content but also enhanced cuw fig 3a d which was also observed by zai et al 2009 the frequent irrigations in this study maintained the cuw above 0 7 fig 3a d however cuw in s2m1 in fss decreased to 0 6 during frequent fertigation in the 2016 growing season between 72 das to 119 das fig 3c but this was not observed in fns relative soil water contents rsw ranging from 0 to 1 were calculated by defining the highest soil water content as 1 in each treatment and the spatial distribution of rsw in the root zone is presented in fig 4 very high or very low rsw could all lead to a lower cuw the s2m1 treatment in fss showed a large low rsw zone rsw was lower than 0 7 at 30 40 cm depth under emitters and 50 60 cm depth fig 4g which was not showed in other treatments fig 4a f h the three way anova results showed that lateral spacings mulching methods and soil types imposed no significant effects on soil water content table 2 while a narrow lateral spacing s2 caused a significant higher cuw 4 43 p 0 05 than that of with a wide lateral spacing s1 the effect of lateral spacing on soil water content was just significant when lateral spacing was wide enough i e more than 1 5 m bozkurt et al 2006 while it was not significant when lateral spacing is narrow chen et al 2015 table 2 it was mainly because wide lateral spacing means an emitter must wet a large area and requires large water application volumes from each emitter which may result in deep losses of irrigation water however this study confirmed that a narrow lateral spacing led to a higher cuw due to more overlapping areas of the neighbouring wetting zones bozkurt et al 2006 zai et al 2009 under drip irrigation with no runoff and limited deep percolation mulching regulated soil water content by a combined effect of soil evaporation and crop respiration full mulching reduced soil evaporation completely while easily enhanced biomass aboveground and crop respiration and easily caused more soil water storage from the sowing to elongation stage due to complete evaporation reduction but led to lower soil water storage after the elongation stage due to higher crop biomass and respiration in our study soil water content was not significantly different between full mulching and partial mulching condition because full mulching caused higher crop biomass and respiration before elongation stage which diminished the effect of more soil evaporation reduction compared with partial mulching condition after elongation stage the leaf area would reach to the maximum platform value laimax allen et al 1998 and led to no significant difference of soil evaporation and crop respiration under different mulching conditions the soil type subsurface sand layer played no significant effects on soil water distribution mainly because of the low total irrigation amounts 346 1 and 223 9 mm in 2015 and 2016 respectively and the limited deep percolation table 4 in this study compared with the irrigation amounts of study of bozkurt et al 2006 550 750 mm and chen et al 2015 300 750 mm 3 2 soil no3 n concentrations and christiansen uniformity coefficient cun soil no3 n deficit 15 mg kg rarely occurred in all treatments mainly due to the frequent n fertigation after the jointing stage fig 5 soil no3 n concentrations increased steadily but cun increased first and then decreased during frequent fertigation fig 5 it was observed that cun tended to decrease sharply with frequent fertigation when soil no3 n concentration exceeded 50 mg kg this may be attributed to the local extreme high soil no3 n concentration exceeds 100 mg kg among the observed points due to the frequent fertigation in addition the subsurface sand layer may have retard downward movement of soil water and no3 n at soil sand interface which maybe was another reason for a more drastic cun decrease in fss wang et al 2005 fan et al 2015 because of a large initial variation of soil no3 n concentrations in all treatments fig 5 relative variation of soil no3 n concentrations rv snc and cun rv cun during the entire crop grow stage were analyzed for three way anova table 3 the narrow lateral spacing s2 caused both significantly higher rv snc 3 38 mg kg 1 p 0 01 and rv cun 4 22 p 0 01 than that with a wide lateral spacing s1 this is because wider lateral spacing s1 caused a lower cuw in 0 20 cm soil layer p 0 05 table 2 thus easily causing more soil nitrate leaching pang et al 1997 wang et al 2013 the narrow lateral spacing helped the base fertilizer dissolve more evenly into soil wang et al 2013 after the first fertigation at v6 stage furthermore during the frequent fertigation a narrow lateral spacing helped fertilizer solute distribute uniformly in the whole root zone in soil with a medium or clay texture li et al 2009 thus avoiding the extreme high soil no3 n concentration the full mulching methods m1 caused significantly higher rv cun 5 34 p 0 01 than partial mulching treatments m2 table 3 compared with full mulched condition soil patch with quite high soil no3 concentration was showed in un mulched zone due to the lateral movement and a redistribution of soil nitrate from the higher water potential area mulched zone to the lower water potential zone un mulched zone within the soil matrix in root zone 3 3 correlation between cuw and cun cuwn the correlation between cuw and cun cuwn was analyzed to investigate the fluctuation consistency of cuw and cun in various treatments the cuwn was not significant in all treatments fig 6 gorska et al 2008 found that the no3 n concentration influences root hydraulic properties around roots which lead to more soil water absorption from the nitrate rich patch thus showing a coupling effect on crop yield zotarelli et al 2009 so soil water regime is commonly regarded closely tied with soil no3 n distribution montovani et al 1995 li 1998 however cuwn was not significant in all mulched drip irrigation treatment this is mainly because that soil no3 n distribution pattern was different from that of soil water the wetted zone extended gradually from the infiltration source afterward soil water redistributed according to the soil water potential however soil no3 n distribution pattern was significantly affected by soil texture the highest concentration of no3 n was commonly observed in the areas most distant from the drip tube in a coarse texture soil while soil no3 n concentrations were uniform throughout the bed in a fine texture soil cook and sanders 1990 li et al 2009 3 4 et yield and wue in 2016 the estimated et was lower than in 2015 table 4 this is likely a result of the lower temperature lower wind speed and higher air humidity in 2016 manifested as lower cumulative pan evaporation the deep drainage d eq 4 in 2016 was greater than that of in 2015 it may due to the high rain fall amounts sweeney et al 2012 it indicates that deep percolation easily occurred when summing 3 day water surface evaporation values of e20 pan for irrigation amount design plants in fns showed higher et 3 3 p 0 01 tables 4 and 6 because roots penetrated to 120 cm depth compared with a depth of 60 cm in fss which is beneficial for crop soil water absorption et of plants in s2 was 4 8 higher p 0 01 tables 4 and 6 than s1 treatments due to a better soil water supply table 2 which was also reported in the study of bozkurt et al 2006 mulching methods showed no significant effect on et table 6 p 0 05 the relationship between wue and grain yield were always linear unless the irrigation frequency was too high i e once in 1 day el hendawy and schmidhalter 2010 so yields in fns was 6 5 higher tables 5 and 6 p 0 01 than fss treatments due to a higher et yields in s2 and m1 treatments were 3 0 and 6 7 higher than that of in s1 and m2 tables 5 and 6 p 0 01 due to a higher grain numbers per plant 4 6 p 0 05 in s2 treatments and higher seedling emergence rate 8 6 p 0 05 in m1 treatments compared with that of in s1 treatments and m2 treatments respectively soil type fns and fss both enhanced et and yield and had no significant effect on water use efficiency wue wue in m1 treatments were 5 1 higher than m2 treatments tables 5 and 6 p 0 01 especially in fns table 5 due to a higher yield and no significant different grain yield table 5 wue in s2 treatments were 7 2 higher than s1 treatments tables 5 and 6 p 0 01 the effect of lateral spacing on yield and wue were influenced by irrigation amounts under high irrigation amounts i e 550 700 mm grain yield and wue first increased and then decreased as the lateral spacing increased which showed a higher yield and under lateral spacing of 1 5 m than that of under 0 7 m and 2 1 m under low irrigation amounts i e 300 mm grain yield and wue were decreased as the lateral spacing increased 3 5 correlation between yield with soil water content soil no3 n concentration and et crop yields showed close correlation with soil water content soil no3 n concentrations snc and cun in fns table 7 however in fss crop yields showed close correlation with soil water content and soil no3 n concentration it was because cun may enhance root distribution root activity luo et al 2013 dodd 2005 and grain filling duration rajcan and tollenaar 1999 which is more important to yield formation than soil water content and no3 n concentrations under no water and nitrate stress condition during reproductive stage from 109 das to 120 das in both years however in fss root penetration was restricted and root shoot ratio was affected by the subsurface sand layer so the effect of cun on shoot and root growth and yield formation may weaken correspondingly in addition the previous studies showed that leaf n content and crop photosynthesis can be reflected by relative chlorophyll content which is commonly evaluated by spad readings hawkins et al 2007 interestingly instead of soil nitrate our study showed that plants under full mulching m1 combined with narrower lateral spacing s2 showed a highest spad readings fig 7 which was in accord with the results of cun averaged value of the entire grow period this may be due to the root distribution and soil water and nitrate absorption regulation by wetted zone under drip fertigation system compared with border irrigation system clothier and sauer 1988 tsutsumi et al 2003 yield showed a negative relationship with δw and et in both fields table 7 which was commonly reported in treatments with excess irrigation amounts that beyond crop requirement kang et al 2002 el hendawy and schmidhalter 2010 it was due to that values of e20 pan can not reflect crop transpiration which is an important component of et this also indicates that although e20 pan provides an easier way to guide irrigation it can be not considered when guiding irrigation by field capacity since its availability is affect by meteorological condition i e precipitation difference between 2015 and 2016 the three way anova table table 6 showed a narrower lateral spacing s2 or full mulching m1 can enhanced crop yield however the results of multiple comparisons showed that grain yields between s1 and s2 treatments were not significantly different table 5 p 0 05 a drip irrigation system with higher cuw and cun i e s2m1 treatment usually represents a higher initial installation cost lamm et al 1997 so based on yield and wue wider irrigation lateral spacing and partial mulching was recommended in fss and wider irrigation lateral spacing and full mulching in fns 4 conclusions in this study the performances and water use efficiency of spring maize were evaluated under different mulching and lateral spacing methods of drip irrigation in the hetao irrigation district in china mainly considering the distribution uniformity of water cuw and no3 n cun the results showed that correlations between cuw and cun cuwn were not significant under mulched drip irrigation system the christiansen uniformity coefficients of soil no3 n concentration cun were positive correlated with grain yields in fns narrower lateral spacing s2 and full mulching m1 could enhanced cun relative chlorophyll content of leaf and crop yield compared with wider lateral spacing s1 and partial mulching m2 respectively however the combined effects of lateral spacings and mulching methods on grain yield were not significantly different full mulching significant enhanced cun thus increasing crop yields and wue in fns so based on crop yields wue and cost of drip lateral the treatment of s1m2 was recommended in fss while s1m1 in fns to reduce the possibility of too high level of n in the micro zone beneath drip emitter which occurred in this study and increase soil cun and crop yield rational application rates and intervals of n fertilizer under mulched drip irrigation deserve further studies acknowledgements this

2013 the indirect methods do not disturb the plant canopy however they require large homogeneous fields to obtain stable valid results in many agricultural studies the size of research plots is often too small to enable the use of micrometeorological methods stewart 1984 baldocchi et al 1988 a direct method may include equipment to obtain and isolate gas samples from plant canopies and analyze the changes of water vapor concentration to determine et a common strategy is to use a canopy chamber to sample the air there are many categories of chamber design such as leaf chambers for plant physiology studies and canopy chambers for field crop studies although a chamber was first used approximately 80 years ago by thomas and hill 1937 ongoing development of gas analyzers enables even more accurate and rapid measurements with canopy chambers of varying shapes and dimensions canopy chambers can be classified as open or closed systems for an open system the gas is continuously pumped into and out of the chamber through opennings or channels the differences of water vapor concentration between the chamber inlet and outlet are measured and used to determine the et flux the measurements can be obtained continuously over time periods from several days to whole growing seasons however complex systems are required to maintain the climate within chambers to be similar to the ambient conditions musgrave and moss 1961 burkart et al 2007 thus the portability of open chambers is usually limited a closed chamber is usually designed as a portable system i e it can be transported among several sampling locations in the field a closed chamber system measures the changes of water vapor concentration inside the chamber to evaluate the instantaneous et rapid measurements for brief periods 1min or so are used to avoid chamber induced canopy microclimate changes garrity et al 1984 wagner and reicosky 1992 reicosky and peters 1977 closed canopy chambers can be cross validated with local micrometeorological or field water balance measurements to provide a small scale complement to the large scale measurements angell and svejcar 1999 dugas et al 1997 due to the usefulness of the chamber techinques multiple designs have been reported steduto et al 2002 reported a chamber design with comprehensive tests of climate changes within the chamber during measurements however actual field measurements are still necessary to evaluate how well canopy chambers measure crop et under a range of time scales and weather conditions in this study the basic structure of the canopy chamber is similar to the chamber reported by steduto et al 2002 however a unique feature of this chamber is that a li 7500 open path co2 h2o infra red gas analyzer li cor biosciences inc lincoln ne is mounted in the center of the chamber instead of a closed path analyzer installed outside of the chamber where air samples from the chamber have to be pumped through the analyzer the closed path analyzer has potential limitations such as the time lag between the air sampling and the analysis and difficulties in obtaining a representative air sample the li 7500 is designed for ec measurements which involve long term deployment in extreme weather conditions it can provide water vapor and co2 concentration values at a frequency of 20hz and does not require frequent recalibration by placing the sensor in the middle of the air space and using multiple fans to thoroughly mix the air the time lag in water vapor measurement is eliminated and data can be collected rapidly potentially reducing the measurement time the objectives of this study are 1 to construct canopy chambers and perform et measurements on corn soybean and reconstructed prairie and 2 to validate the canopy chamber results with ec measurements and with field water balance measurements over a range of time scales steduto et al 2002 already provided detailed information on chamber induced microclimate conditions and on how they influence the measured et results and the growth patterns of the crops corn soybean and reconstructed prairie have already been reported such as in dietzel et al 2015a thus the focus of this paper is limited to the field et measurements 2 materials and methods 2 1 the portable canopy chamber design and data interpertation a portable canopy chamber fig 1 was constructed of aluminum framing with mylar film clear polyester film of 0 08mm thickness covering a flexible rubber layer was placed around the bottom edges the canopy chamber has a footprint area of 1 5m2 three canopy chambers with different heights 0 6m 1 0m and 1 6m were used to match the different crop growth stages the mylar film is durable resisting punctures and tears musgrave and moss 1961 while the rubber layer was used to seal the chamber against any leaks at the soil surface an li 7500 was mounted inside the chamber to measure water vapor concentrations inside the chamber with respect to time which were used to calculate the et flux a li 7550 interface unit was used to control the li 7500 irga additional auxiliary sensors were used to measure the chamber and ambient climate conditions e g air temperature solar radiation atmospheric pressure and canopy temperature which were used to verify the similarity of climate conditions inside and outside of the chamber because of the greenhouse effect the air temperature inside of the chamber increases during a measurement wagner and reicosky 1992 in order to monitor the temperature difference four copper constantan thermocouples were mounted inside and outside of the chamber to measure air temperature approximately 0 2 1 2m above the ground surface and two infra red thermometers irr 111 apogee instruments inc logan ut were also mounted inside and outside of the chamber to measure the canopy temperature temperature differences were kept within 2 c before and during each measurement atmospheric pressure could also alter the et flux lund et al 1999 therefore two barometers sb 100 apogee instruments inc logan ut were mounted to measure the air pressure inside and outside of the chamber and a vent at a bottom corner of the chamber connected to outside air via a 1m tube inside the chamber was used to balance the air pressure inside and outside the chamber the 1m tube was used to minimize gas loss by diffusion during a measurement two li 190sb quantum sensors li cor biosciences inc lincoln ne were mounted inside and outside of the chamber to monitor the differences in photosynthetic active radiation steduto et al 2002 dc axial fans 80 mm diameter with flow rates of 0 93m3 min 1 nmb technologies inc chatsworth ca were installed at lower and upper corners of the chambers to mix the gas inside of the chamber although the fans caused minor convection at the leaf air interface and soil air interface steduto et al 2002 reported that impact on et was not significant a cr 3000 micro logger campbell scientific inc logan ut was used for collection and storage of data from the canopy chamber sensors the sampling frequency was 20hz for all of the sensors the chamber li 7500 directly measures water vapor concentrations with time a quadratic regression qr of the water vapor concentration w mmoll 1 versus time is used to determine et fluxes wagner et al 1997 the qr model is 1 w a w t 2 b w t c w where t is the sampling time and a w b w c w are fitted parameters an example of the qr model fitted to the measured water vapor concentrations is shown in fig 2 a reason for the quadratic pattern is that the water vapor concentration inside of the chamber increased with time leading to a decreasing water vapor deficit which reduces the measured et the slope of the water vapor curves at the initial time t 0 is selected to determine the instantaneous et at the time that the crop canopy is first covered by the chamber in the following discussion et fluxes will be presented with units of mmh 1 by the end of each of the field measurements the temperature differences between inside and ouside of the chamber did not extend 2 c for the thermocouples and irts the air pressure within the chamber was 0 1kpa larger than the ambient air pressure during the field measurements the par inside the chamber was about 30 less than the outside par which was about 5 10 larger than the results reported by musgrave and moss 1961 and steduto et al 2002 2 2 laboratory tests a mass balance method was used in a laboratory pre test of the canopy chamber to determine the accuracy and stability of chamber measurements to obtain a range of e fluxes water filled evaporation pans were positioned under canopy chambers and the mass change of each evaporation pan measured with an electronic balance was used to determine the actual e flux a canopy chamber was placed over the evaporation pan and measured simultaneously with the mass balance method the e fluxes determined by the canopy chamber method were compared with the mass balance method laboratory experiments were performed more than 50 times with various e fluxes for the small medium and large chambers the laboratory test results of the canopy chambers are presented in fig 3 small chamber measured values and mass balance estimated values match the 1 1 line for e fluxes ranging from 0 to 0 40mmh 1 medium and large chamber measured values and mass balance estimated values match the 1 1 line for e fluxes ranging from 0 to 0 85mmh 1 these laboratory test ranges cover the ranges of chamber et fluxes in the field plots the small chamber was used in the field for the measurement of bare soil and small crops during the early growing season when the et flux did not exceed 0 30mmh 1 the medium chamber was used in the field during the middle growing season when et flux did not exceed 0 55mmh 1 the large chamber was used in the field for the late growing season when et flux did not exceed 0 80mmh 1 thus the laboratory test results indicated that the small medium and large chambers were able to determine et accurately 2 3 field measurements field measurements were performed at the iowa state university cobs comparison of bio fuel systems research site located in boone county ia 41 55 n 93 45 w the cobs field was established in 2008 and there are 24 plots 61m by 27m and 6 cropping systems on webster fine loamy mixed superactive mesic typic endoaquolls and nicollet fine loamy mixed superactive mesic aquic hapludolls soils the 6 zero till cropping systems include corn soybean soybean corn continuous corn and continuous corn with winter rye secale cereale cover crop reconstructed mixed prairie c3 grasses c4 grasses legumes and multi functional group mixtures and fertilized reconstructed mixed prairie daigh et al 2015 dietzel et al 2015b jarchow et al 2015 measurements were made in 4 replications of 3 cropping systems corn and soybean in corn soybean rotation system and reconstructed mixed prairie in 2013 for corn and soybean the planting date was doy 137 and the harvesting dates were doy 282 and doy 274 respectively in 2014 the planting date for corn and soybean was doy 140 and the harvesting date was doy 287 the perennial mixed prairie was seeded in 2008 and the biomass harvest date in 2013 was doy 301 and in 2014 it was doy 318 canopy chamber measurements were made on 18days during the 2013 growing season and on 15days during the 2014 growing season in 2014 a sap flow system and micro lysimeters were used as complementary measurements for the chamber in the corn plots when the height of the corn plant exceeded the height of the large chamber 1 6m sapflow and micro lysimeter measurements extended the et determination in corn to the end of the growing period baker and van bavel 1987 the sapflow systems were installed in one row near the canopy chamber footprints with five sgb19 sapflow gages dynamax 2005 sapflow measurements were taken every 30min from 4 00 a m to 10 00 p m every day the correction from wang et al 2017 was used to determine corn t from the sapflow data the micro lysimeters were installed in the same row as the sap flow measurement system in each corn plot five micro lysimeters were used in each plot and the mass changes represented the daily e flux boast and robertson 1982 the ec flux tower measurements were made at brooks field site no 10 located in boone county ia 41 58 n 93 41 w the site has a corn soybean rotation on webster fine loamy mixed superactive mesic typic endoaquolls nicollet fine loamy mixed superactive mesic aquic hapludolls and clarion fine loamy mixed superactive mesic typic hapludolls soils the ec technique relies on the fact that the fluctuations of vertical wind speed are correlated to the fluctuations of water vapor density 2 e t ρ ˆ w c v where ρ ˆ is the molar density of the air and w c v is the covariance of wind speed and mole fraction of water vapor the webb et al 1980 correction was applied to calculate the et the ec flux tower measurements were used to estimate et of corn in 2013 and soybean in 2014 in 2013 the corn planting and harvesting dates were doy 139 and doy 298 in 2014 the soybean planting and harvesting dates were doy 138 and doy 291 the flux tower instruments were positioned 250cm above the ground surface for soybean and 500cm above the ground surface for corn the ec flux tower results are used to evaluate the performance of the chamber method the field water balance method uses soil moisture precipitation and drainage data to estimate crop et the soil water content in each field plot was measured with 5te or 5tm sensors decagon devices inc pullman wa soil moisture sensors were installed in each plot at depths of 5 10 18 30 and 50cm and the soil water storage in the 0 60cm soil layer was computed weather data including wind speed solar radiation air temperature air humidity and precipitation were collected at the cobs site weather station campbell scientific inc logan ut subsurface drains installed about 1m deep along the center of each plot emptied into a sump daigh et al 2015 the volumes of drainage water were measured by t 10 flow meters neptune technology group inc tallassee al the field water balance method is based on the following equation 3 p d r δ θ l e t where p mm is the precipitation d mm is the drainage r mm is the surface runoff the plots have low slope so the surface runoff is assumed to be zero δθ l mm is the change of soil water storage where θ m3 m 3 is the volumetric soil water content and l mm is soil layer thickness allen et al 1998 the aim of the field water balance method is to quantify all water balance components on the left hand side of eq 3 to compute et accurately monitoring short time changes in soil moisture is one of the challenges of this method timlin et al 2007 reported that low time resolution and time lag are two potential drawbacks for the field water balance method due to the soil root interaction and soil and plant water capacity which can buffer instantaneous variations of et thus the field water balance will compare with chamber results over a long time period 2 4 cumulative et fluxes estimation daily cumulative et values are calculated by integrating the instantaneous et values with the trapezoid rule i e 4 e t d i 0 n e t i e t i 1 2 t i 1 t i where et d is the daily cumulative et et i is the instantaneous et at time t i similar for et i 1 at t i 1 parkin and kaspar 2004 because the canopy chambers did not provide continuous measurements the daily et values between two chamber measuring days and the cumulative et throughout the measurement period was calculated based on a recurrent neural network model rnn a rnn model is a special version of artificial neural network models including historical information kůrková 1992 katsuura and sprecher 1994 and it has been used in other cropping and environmental studies kim and kim 2008 chai et al 2012 the rnn models are formulated by using the et on previous days and the radiation on the current day to calculate the daily cumulative et in order to implement the rnn model we first use linear interpolation based on the chamber measured daily et from eq 4 to provide the first predictions to the daily et when the chamber measurements were not applied i e e t d i i 1 2 3 and then filter the first prediction with the following rnn model 5 e t d i p r s f e t d i e t d i 1 e t d i 2 where p r s is the polynomial of the solar radiation r s the f is a artificial neural network model and e t d i is the output the rnn was trained with the matlab mathworks inc natick ma neural network toolbox the degree of the polynomial p and the time step in f were selected with cross validation 3 results and discussion in this section we first compare the instantaneous daily and cumulative et over the measurement periods of the canopy chamber with the ec results to evaluate the field performance of the canopy chambers the instantaneous comparison can directly show the agreement between the chamber and ec results while the daily and cumulative comparisons indicate the consistency and the stability of the two methods over relatively long periods which can better reflect the performance of the chamber since they smooth out the instantaneous errors after that we make further comparisons between the canopy chamber results including sapflow and micro lysimeter results for corn and the field water balance results 3 1 comparison of chamber and ec flux tower methods fig 4 presents a comparison of instantaneous canopy chamber et with the flux tower et for corn in 2013 and soybean in 2014 in order to compare the values at the same times the flux tower results were interpolated with a least squares support vector machine model suykens et al 2002 to provide values at the canopy chamber measurement times linear regressions of canopy chamber et and flux tower et are presented as the blue lines in fig 4 the ec flux tower et values and the chamber et values are similar but they do not match exactly the 1 1 line the regression results slopes intercepts and the confidence intervals ci with α 0 05 are listed in table 1 the regression line slopes were not significantly different from 1 the intercept value of the soybean et regression was significantly larger than 0 while the corn intercept value was not significantly different from 0 one reason for the difference is that the measurement heights of the two methods differed the chamber measurements represented the canopy level while the flux tower measurements were made about 250cm above the ground and there could be an unaccounted time lag between the canopy chamber and flux tower measurements the physical separation of canopy and flux tower also means that the wind speed could be different in addition the chamber measurement is only for 1min it would be difficult to match the measurement with the same minute on the ec results due to the oscillation of ec measurements refer to fig 5 considering these factors the measurements were in quite good agreement the difference between the canopy chamber and ec results can be smoothed out by using daily and seasonal cumulative values for canopy chamber and flux tower measurements refer to figs 6 and 7 before we present the cumulative et comparisons it will be interesting to plot the daily patterns of the chamber measured et and the ec flux tower et fig 5a and b show examples of daytime chamber and flux tower et values for corn on doy 179 2013 and for soybean on doy 212 2014 the diurnal patterns of chamber results and flux tower results were similar for corn and soybean the canopy chamber et values matched the daytime flux tower values well except for some data points near the maxima of the et fluxes due to the relative large oscillations in the flux tower data however the chamber values were within the oscillation range of the flux tower results during the morning and late afternoon time periods the numerical oscillations of the flux tower results were small and the chamber results agreed well with the flux tower results fig 6 presents the daytime cumulative chamber and flux tower et values the regression lines for the data points are represented by the blue lines and the regression results slopes intercepts and cis with α 0 05 are listed in table 2 the regression lines are not significantly different from the 1 1 lines thus there is a good match between the chamber daily et values and the flux tower et the cumulative chamber and cumulative flux tower et for corn 2013 and soybean 2014 over the chamber measurement period are presented in fig 7 a and b the cumulative et values are listed in table 3 the patterns of canopy chamber cumulative et are similar to the flux tower results for both corn and soybean the rnn interpolations of chamber et are similar to the continuously measured flux tower et values the chamber mesurements for corn in 2013 stopped on doy 206 because the height of corn exceeded the height of the tallest canopy chamber the differences between cumulative chamber measurements and the flux tower measurements for corn and for soybean are less than 10 throughout the measurement period the differences of the final cumulative values are less than 5 of the cumulative et in summary the agreement between canopy chamber results and flux tower et results indicates that canopy chamber measurements in small plots are able to obtain results similar to the flux tower values obtained in much larger fields for a range of time scales the results demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the canopy chamber method 3 2 comparison of chamber et and field water balance et in this section the chamber et is compared with water balance et the time period for the comparisons between chamber and field water balance results in 2013 was from doy 164 255 because the corn outgrew the chamber the comparison period for corn was from doy 164 206 in 2014 the comparison period for prairie and soybean was doy 156 277 and the comparison period for corn ended on doy 212 however by including the sapflow and micro lysemeter measurements corn et measurements were extended to doy 261 the cumulative precipitation change in soil water content cumulative drainage and cumulative water balance estimated et for the 2013 measurement period are presented in fig 8 the 27year 1986 2012 average cumulative precipitation for the measurement period was 326mm with standard deviation of 32mm while the cumulative precipitation in 2013 was only 149mm thus the 2013 growing season was noticeably drier than the average growing season during the 2013 measurement period the only two large precipitation events occured on doy 203 16mm and doy 223 51mm although these precipitation events caused immediate increases in soil water content overall the soil water content decreased during the growing season due to the drought like conditions et values were relatively small in 2013 and the cumulative drainage values were less than 20mm the cumulative precipitation change in soil water content cumulative drainage and cumulative water balance estimated et during the 2014 measurement period doy 164 277 are presented in fig 9 a to d the 27year 1986 2012 average precipitation for the measurement period was 408mm with standard deviation of 39mm while the seasonal precipitation in 2014 was 601mm thus the 2014 growing season was noticeably wetter than the average growing season during the 2014 measurement period precipitation was evenly distributed throughout the growing season the water content decreased in the early measurement period and increased by the end of the measurement period however due to plentiful precipitation in 2014 the differences between the initial water contents and final water contents for the three crops were small the cumulative drainage values ranged from 200 to 250mm comparisons between the chamber measured et and field water balance estimated et are shown in fig 10 and table 4 the differences between the field water balance and chamber method were within 10 field water balance calculations were influenced by large rainfall events thus the results contained some oscillations the cumulative chamber et generally matched well with the field water balance et as it increased smoothly with respect to time in 2014 the sapflow and micro lysimeter measurements extended the chamber measurements for corn and indicated a consistent trend between the chamber et and sapflow and micro lysimeter et values the pattern of the cumulative et in corn was similar to the patterns in prairie and soybean for the whole measurement period 4 summary in this study canopy chambers that improved the design of steduto et al 2002 were tested under controlled laboratory conditions and under natural field conditions field et measurements were made in corn soybean and reconstructed mixed prairie field plots in 2013 and 2014 and canopy chamber et results for corn and soybean were compared with ec flux tower et results the instantaneous chamber results were similar to the ec flux tower values the chamber daily instantaneous et patterns the chamber cumulative daily et values and the chamber cumulative seasonal et values were consistent with the ec flux tower results with relative errors less than 10 thus the field performance of the canopy chamber was validated field water balance et was estimated in 2013 and 2014 cumulative canopy chamber et was similar to the field water balance et in 2013 and 2014 field water balance is suitable for estimating et over time periods of several weeks or longer while the canopy chamber can measure et from instantaneous to seasonal time scales relative to the ec flux tower method and the field water balance method an advantage of the canopy chamber method is that instantaneous measurements can be performed on small scale field plots moreover the chamber is easy to set up and the chamber can be transported rapidly among multiple field plots thus chambers can obtain measurements for several cropping systems during the same time period the study provided evidence that the portable canopy chamber is a reliable efficient and accurate way to measure et in field plots for a range of time scales instantaneous daily and seasonal in corn soybean and reconstructed prairie we performed and validated chamber measurements in 2013 a relatively dry season and 2014 a relatively wet season which shows that the chamber method is robust over a range of weather conditions future studies should include tests of chamber method over a range of climate conditions numerical simulation studies of et can also be used to further evaluate the chamber method co2 as well as et exchanges in field plots can also be investigated with canopy chambers to study crop photosynthesis and water use efficiency which will provide additional information on the usefulness of the canopy chamber acknowledgment this work was supported by grants from the iowa water center

analyzer the closed path analyzer has potential limitations such as the time lag between the air sampling and the analysis and difficulties in obtaining a representative air sample the li 7500 is designed for ec measurements which involve long term deployment in extreme weather conditions it can provide water vapor and co2 concentration values at a frequency of 20hz and does not require frequent recalibration by placing the sensor in the middle of the air space and using multiple fans to thoroughly mix the air the time lag in water vapor measurement is eliminated and data can be collected rapidly potentially reducing the measurement time the objectives of this study are 1 to construct canopy chambers and perform et measurements on corn soybean and reconstructed prairie and 2 to validate the canopy chamber results with ec measurements and with field water balance measurements over a range of time scales steduto et al 2002 already provided detailed information on chamber induced microclimate conditions and on how they influence the measured et results and the growth patterns of the crops corn soybean and reconstructed prairie have already been reported such as in dietzel et al 2015a thus the focus of this paper is limited to the field et measurements 2 materials and methods 2 1 the portable canopy chamber design and data interpertation a portable canopy chamber fig 1 was constructed of aluminum framing with mylar film clear polyester film of 0 08mm thickness covering a flexible rubber layer was placed around the bottom edges the canopy chamber has a footprint area of 1 5m2 three canopy chambers with different heights 0 6m 1 0m and 1 6m were used to match the different crop growth stages the mylar film is durable resisting punctures and tears musgrave and moss 1961 while the rubber layer was used to seal the chamber against any leaks at the soil surface an li 7500 was mounted inside the chamber to measure water vapor concentrations inside the chamber with respect to time which were used to calculate the et flux a li 7550 interface unit was used to control the li 7500 irga additional auxiliary sensors were used to measure the chamber and ambient climate conditions e g air temperature solar radiation atmospheric pressure and canopy temperature which were used to verify the similarity of climate conditions inside and outside of the chamber because of the greenhouse effect the air temperature inside of the chamber increases during a measurement wagner and reicosky 1992 in order to monitor the temperature difference four copper constantan thermocouples were mounted inside and outside of the chamber to measure air temperature approximately 0 2 1 2m above the ground surface and two infra red thermometers irr 111 apogee instruments inc logan ut were also mounted inside and outside of the chamber to measure the canopy temperature temperature differences were kept within 2 c before and during each measurement atmospheric pressure could also alter the et flux lund et al 1999 therefore two barometers sb 100 apogee instruments inc logan ut were mounted to measure the air pressure inside and outside of the chamber and a vent at a bottom corner of the chamber connected to outside air via a 1m tube inside the chamber was used to balance the air pressure inside and outside the chamber the 1m tube was used to minimize gas loss by diffusion during a measurement two li 190sb quantum sensors li cor biosciences inc lincoln ne were mounted inside and outside of the chamber to monitor the differences in photosynthetic active radiation steduto et al 2002 dc axial fans 80 mm diameter with flow rates of 0 93m3 min 1 nmb technologies inc chatsworth ca were installed at lower and upper corners of the chambers to mix the gas inside of the chamber although the fans caused minor convection at the leaf air interface and soil air interface steduto et al 2002 reported that impact on et was not significant a cr 3000 micro logger campbell scientific inc logan ut was used for collection and storage of data from the canopy chamber sensors the sampling frequency was 20hz for all of the sensors the chamber li 7500 directly measures water vapor concentrations with time a quadratic regression qr of the water vapor concentration w mmoll 1 versus time is used to determine et fluxes wagner et al 1997 the qr model is 1 w a w t 2 b w t c w where t is the sampling time and a w b w c w are fitted parameters an example of the qr model fitted to the measured water vapor concentrations is shown in fig 2 a reason for the quadratic pattern is that the water vapor concentration inside of the chamber increased with time leading to a decreasing water vapor deficit which reduces the measured et the slope of the water vapor curves at the initial time t 0 is selected to determine the instantaneous et at the time that the crop canopy is first covered by the chamber in the following discussion et fluxes will be presented with units of mmh 1 by the end of each of the field measurements the temperature differences between inside and ouside of the chamber did not extend 2 c for the thermocouples and irts the air pressure within the chamber was 0 1kpa larger than the ambient air pressure during the field measurements the par inside the chamber was about 30 less than the outside par which was about 5 10 larger than the results reported by musgrave and moss 1961 and steduto et al 2002 2 2 laboratory tests a mass balance method was used in a laboratory pre test of the canopy chamber to determine the accuracy and stability of chamber measurements to obtain a range of e fluxes water filled evaporation pans were positioned under canopy chambers and the mass change of each evaporation pan measured with an electronic balance was used to determine the actual e flux a canopy chamber was placed over the evaporation pan and measured simultaneously with the mass balance method the e fluxes determined by the canopy chamber method were compared with the mass balance method laboratory experiments were performed more than 50 times with various e fluxes for the small medium and large chambers the laboratory test results of the canopy chambers are presented in fig 3 small chamber measured values and mass balance estimated values match the 1 1 line for e fluxes ranging from 0 to 0 40mmh 1 medium and large chamber measured values and mass balance estimated values match the 1 1 line for e fluxes ranging from 0 to 0 85mmh 1 these laboratory test ranges cover the ranges of chamber et fluxes in the field plots the small chamber was used in the field for the measurement of bare soil and small crops during the early growing season when the et flux did not exceed 0 30mmh 1 the medium chamber was used in the field during the middle growing season when et flux did not exceed 0 55mmh 1 the large chamber was used in the field for the late growing season when et flux did not exceed 0 80mmh 1 thus the laboratory test results indicated that the small medium and large chambers were able to determine et accurately 2 3 field measurements field measurements were performed at the iowa state university cobs comparison of bio fuel systems research site located in boone county ia 41 55 n 93 45 w the cobs field was established in 2008 and there are 24 plots 61m by 27m and 6 cropping systems on webster fine loamy mixed superactive mesic typic endoaquolls and nicollet fine loamy mixed superactive mesic aquic hapludolls soils the 6 zero till cropping systems include corn soybean soybean corn continuous corn and continuous corn with winter rye secale cereale cover crop reconstructed mixed prairie c3 grasses c4 grasses legumes and multi functional group mixtures and fertilized reconstructed mixed prairie daigh et al 2015 dietzel et al 2015b jarchow et al 2015 measurements were made in 4 replications of 3 cropping systems corn and soybean in corn soybean rotation system and reconstructed mixed prairie in 2013 for corn and soybean the planting date was doy 137 and the harvesting dates were doy 282 and doy 274 respectively in 2014 the planting date for corn and soybean was doy 140 and the harvesting date was doy 287 the perennial mixed prairie was seeded in 2008 and the biomass harvest date in 2013 was doy 301 and in 2014 it was doy 318 canopy chamber measurements were made on 18days during the 2013 growing season and on 15days during the 2014 growing season in 2014 a sap flow system and micro lysimeters were used as complementary measurements for the chamber in the corn plots when the height of the corn plant exceeded the height of the large chamber 1 6m sapflow and micro lysimeter measurements extended the et determination in corn to the end of the growing period baker and van bavel 1987 the sapflow systems were installed in one row near the canopy chamber footprints with five sgb19 sapflow gages dynamax 2005 sapflow measurements were taken every 30min from 4 00 a m to 10 00 p m every day the correction from wang et al 2017 was used to determine corn t from the sapflow data the micro lysimeters were installed in the same row as the sap flow measurement system in each corn plot five micro lysimeters were used in each plot and the mass changes represented the daily e flux boast and robertson 1982 the ec flux tower measurements were made at brooks field site no 10 located in boone county ia 41 58 n 93 41 w the site has a corn soybean rotation on webster fine loamy mixed superactive mesic typic endoaquolls nicollet fine loamy mixed superactive mesic aquic hapludolls and clarion fine loamy mixed superactive mesic typic hapludolls soils the ec technique relies on the fact that the fluctuations of vertical wind speed are correlated to the fluctuations of water vapor density 2 e t ρ ˆ w c v where ρ ˆ is the molar density of the air and w c v is the covariance of wind speed and mole fraction of water vapor the webb et al 1980 correction was applied to calculate the et the ec flux tower measurements were used to estimate et of corn in 2013 and soybean in 2014 in 2013 the corn planting and harvesting dates were doy 139 and doy 298 in 2014 the soybean planting and harvesting dates were doy 138 and doy 291 the flux tower instruments were positioned 250cm above the ground surface for soybean and 500cm above the ground surface for corn the ec flux tower results are used to evaluate the performance of the chamber method the field water balance method uses soil moisture precipitation and drainage data to estimate crop et the soil water content in each field plot was measured with 5te or 5tm sensors decagon devices inc pullman wa soil moisture sensors were installed in each plot at depths of 5 10 18 30 and 50cm and the soil water storage in the 0 60cm soil layer was computed weather data including wind speed solar radiation air temperature air humidity and precipitation were collected at the cobs site weather station campbell scientific inc logan ut subsurface drains installed about 1m deep along the center of each plot emptied into a sump daigh et al 2015 the volumes of drainage water were measured by t 10 flow meters neptune technology group inc tallassee al the field water balance method is based on the following equation 3 p d r δ θ l e t where p mm is the precipitation d mm is the drainage r mm is the surface runoff the plots have low slope so the surface runoff is assumed to be zero δθ l mm is the change of soil water storage where θ m3 m 3 is the volumetric soil water content and l mm is soil layer thickness allen et al 1998 the aim of the field water balance method is to quantify all water balance components on the left hand side of eq 3 to compute et accurately monitoring short time changes in soil moisture is one of the challenges of this method timlin et al 2007 reported that low time resolution and time lag are two potential drawbacks for the field water balance method due to the soil root interaction and soil and plant water capacity which can buffer instantaneous variations of et thus the field water balance will compare with chamber results over a long time period 2 4 cumulative et fluxes estimation daily cumulative et values are calculated by integrating the instantaneous et values with the trapezoid rule i e 4 e t d i 0 n e t i e t i 1 2 t i 1 t i where et d is the daily cumulative et et i is the instantaneous et at time t i similar for et i 1 at t i 1 parkin and kaspar 2004 because the canopy chambers did not provide continuous measurements the daily et values between two chamber measuring days and the cumulative et throughout the measurement period was calculated based on a recurrent neural network model rnn a rnn model is a special version of artificial neural network models including historical information kůrková 1992 katsuura and sprecher 1994 and it has been used in other cropping and environmental studies kim and kim 2008 chai et al 2012 the rnn models are formulated by using the et on previous days and the radiation on the current day to calculate the daily cumulative et in order to implement the rnn model we first use linear interpolation based on the chamber measured daily et from eq 4 to provide the first predictions to the daily et when the chamber measurements were not applied i e e t d i i 1 2 3 and then filter the first prediction with the following rnn model 5 e t d i p r s f e t d i e t d i 1 e t d i 2 where p r s is the polynomial of the solar radiation r s the f is a artificial neural network model and e t d i is the output the rnn was trained with the matlab mathworks inc natick ma neural network toolbox the degree of the polynomial p and the time step in f were selected with cross validation 3 results and discussion in this section we first compare the instantaneous daily and cumulative et over the measurement periods of the canopy chamber with the ec results to evaluate the field performance of the canopy chambers the instantaneous comparison can directly show the agreement between the chamber and ec results while the daily and cumulative comparisons indicate the consistency and the stability of the two methods over relatively long periods which can better reflect the performance of the chamber since they smooth out the instantaneous errors after that we make further comparisons between the canopy chamber results including sapflow and micro lysimeter results for corn and the field water balance results 3 1 comparison of chamber and ec flux tower methods fig 4 presents a comparison of instantaneous canopy chamber et with the flux tower et for corn in 2013 and soybean in 2014 in order to compare the values at the same times the flux tower results were interpolated with a least squares support vector machine model suykens et al 2002 to provide values at the canopy chamber measurement times linear regressions of canopy chamber et and flux tower et are presented as the blue lines in fig 4 the ec flux tower et values and the chamber et values are similar but they do not match exactly the 1 1 line the regression results slopes intercepts and the confidence intervals ci with α 0 05 are listed in table 1 the regression line slopes were not significantly different from 1 the intercept value of the soybean et regression was significantly larger than 0 while the corn intercept value was not significantly different from 0 one reason for the difference is that the measurement heights of the two methods differed the chamber measurements represented the canopy level while the flux tower measurements were made about 250cm above the ground and there could be an unaccounted time lag between the canopy chamber and flux tower measurements the physical separation of canopy and flux tower also means that the wind speed could be different in addition the chamber measurement is only for 1min it would be difficult to match the measurement with the same minute on the ec results due to the oscillation of ec measurements refer to fig 5 considering these factors the measurements were in quite good agreement the difference between the canopy chamber and ec results can be smoothed out by using daily and seasonal cumulative values for canopy chamber and flux tower measurements refer to figs 6 and 7 before we present the cumulative et comparisons it will be interesting to plot the daily patterns of the chamber measured et and the ec flux tower et fig 5a and b show examples of daytime chamber and flux tower et values for corn on doy 179 2013 and for soybean on doy 212 2014 the diurnal patterns of chamber results and flux tower results were similar for corn and soybean the canopy chamber et values matched the daytime flux tower values well except for some data points near the maxima of the et fluxes due to the relative large oscillations in the flux tower data however the chamber values were within the oscillation range of the flux tower results during the morning and late afternoon time periods the numerical oscillations of the flux tower results were small and the chamber results agreed well with the flux tower results fig 6 presents the daytime cumulative chamber and flux tower et values the regression lines for the data points are represented by the blue lines and the regression results slopes intercepts and cis with α 0 05 are listed in table 2 the regression lines are not significantly different from the 1 1 lines thus there is a good match between the chamber daily et values and the flux tower et the cumulative chamber and cumulative flux tower et for corn 2013 and soybean 2014 over the chamber measurement period are presented in fig 7 a and b the cumulative et values are listed in table 3 the patterns of canopy chamber cumulative et are similar to the flux tower results for both corn and soybean the rnn interpolations of chamber et are similar to the continuously measured flux tower et values the chamber mesurements for corn in 2013 stopped on doy 206 because the height of corn exceeded the height of the tallest canopy chamber the differences between cumulative chamber measurements and the flux tower measurements for corn and for soybean are less than 10 throughout the measurement period the differences of the final cumulative values are less than 5 of the cumulative et in summary the agreement between canopy chamber results and flux tower et results indicates that canopy chamber measurements in small plots are able to obtain results similar to the flux tower values obtained in much larger fields for a range of time scales the results demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the canopy chamber method 3 2 comparison of chamber et and field water balance et in this section the chamber et is compared with water balance et the time period for the comparisons between chamber and field water balance results in 2013 was from doy 164 255 because the corn outgrew the chamber the comparison period for corn was from doy 164 206 in 2014 the comparison period for prairie and soybean was doy 156 277 and the comparison period for corn ended on doy 212 however by including the sapflow and micro lysemeter measurements corn et measurements were extended to doy 261 the cumulative precipitation change in soil water content cumulative drainage and cumulative water balance estimated et for the 2013 measurement period are presented in fig 8 the 27year 1986 2012 average cumulative precipitation for the measurement period was 326mm with standard deviation of 32mm while the cumulative precipitation in 2013 was only 149mm thus the 2013 growing season was noticeably drier than the average growing season during the 2013 measurement period the only two large precipitation events occured on doy 203 16mm and doy 223 51mm although these precipitation events caused immediate increases in soil water content overall the soil water content decreased during the growing season due to the drought like conditions et values were relatively small in 2013 and the cumulative drainage values were less than 20mm the cumulative precipitation change in soil water content cumulative drainage and cumulative water balance estimated et during the 2014 measurement period doy 164 277 are presented in fig 9 a to d the 27year 1986 2012 average precipitation for the measurement period was 408mm with standard deviation of 39mm while the seasonal precipitation in 2014 was 601mm thus the 2014 growing season was noticeably wetter than the average growing season during the 2014 measurement period precipitation was evenly distributed throughout the growing season the water content decreased in the early measurement period and increased by the end of the measurement period however due to plentiful precipitation in 2014 the differences between the initial water contents and final water contents for the three crops were small the cumulative drainage values ranged from 200 to 250mm comparisons between the chamber measured et and field water balance estimated et are shown in fig 10 and table 4 the differences between the field water balance and chamber method were within 10 field water balance calculations were influenced by large rainfall events thus the results contained some oscillations the cumulative chamber et generally matched well with the field water balance et as it increased smoothly with respect to time in 2014 the sapflow and micro lysimeter measurements extended the chamber measurements for corn and indicated a consistent trend between the chamber et and sapflow and micro lysimeter et values the pattern of the cumulative et in corn was similar to the patterns in prairie and soybean for the whole measurement period 4 summary in this study canopy chambers that improved the design of steduto et al 2002 were tested under controlled laboratory conditions and under natural field conditions field et measurements were made in corn soybean and reconstructed mixed prairie field plots in 2013 and 2014 and canopy chamber et results for corn and soybean were compared with ec flux tower et results the instantaneous chamber results were similar to the ec flux tower values the chamber daily instantaneous et patterns the chamber cumulative daily et values and the chamber cumulative seasonal et values were consistent with the ec flux tower results with relative errors less than 10 thus the field performance of the canopy chamber was validated field water balance et was estimated in 2013 and 2014 cumulative canopy chamber et was similar to the field water balance et in 2013 and 2014 field water balance is suitable for estimating et over time periods of several weeks or longer while the canopy chamber can measure et from instantaneous to seasonal time scales relative to the ec flux tower method and the field water balance method an advantage of the canopy chamber method is that instantaneous measurements can be performed on small scale field plots moreover the chamber is easy to set up and the chamber can be transported rapidly among multiple field plots thus chambers can obtain measurements for several cropping systems during the same time period the study provided evidence that the portable canopy chamber is a reliable efficient and accurate way to measure et in field plots for a range of time scales instantaneous daily and seasonal in corn soybean and reconstructed prairie we performed and validated chamber measurements in 2013 a relatively dry season and 2014 a relatively wet season which shows that the chamber method is robust over a range of weather conditions future studies should include tests of chamber method over a range of climate conditions numerical simulation studies of et can also be used to further evaluate the chamber method co2 as well as et exchanges in field plots can also be investigated with canopy chambers to study crop photosynthesis and water use efficiency which will provide additional information on the usefulness of the canopy chamber acknowledgment this work was supported by grants from the iowa water center

11574,water management techniques such as continuous irrigation with running water cirw have been used by japanese farmers to control the thermal environment for rice cropping in this study to optimize this method to control the thermal environment in paddy fields theoretical equations for predicting water and vegetation temperatures in a paddy field were obtained first the equations to calculate water and vegetation temperatures in a paddy field were obtained by solving the heat balance equations of the paddy water and vegetation taking into account the effect of horizontal heat convection driven by irrigation the equations were validated by comparisons with observed water temperatures in a conventional paddy field under cirw the calculated changes in water temperatures over time and distance showed good agreement with observed values with a root mean square error of 0 39 c this result indicated that the equations satisfactorily expressed the features of paddy water temperature under cirw next these equations were used to determine the effects of irrigation rate paddy water depth and wind speed on water and rice plant temperatures the following results were obtained 1 the area cooled by cirw was positively related to irrigation rate and negatively related to water depth 2 low water depths were preferable for application of cirw during the nighttime 3 slower wind speeds and latent heat flux from vegetation strengthened the effects of water management on vegetation temperature the proposed equations and analyses represent the common features of the effect of irrigation on water and vegetation temperatures in a paddy field and provide quantitative information about the effects of water management techniques on the thermal environment for rice cropping keywords paddy field irrigation thermal environment in paddy fields heat balance equation analytical solution heat damage of rice 1 introduction water and air temperatures in paddy fields substantially affect rice growth yield and quality in japan recent high air temperatures during the rice grain ripening period have decreased the quantity and quality of the rice crop consequently high temperatures have become a major concern for rice cultivation morita 2008 terashima et al 2001 high temperatures increase the percentages of immature and cracked rice grains nagata et al 2005 tashiro and wardlaw 1991 terashima et al 2001 these types of damage reduce the overall grade of rice in quality surveys morita 2008 and thus reduce the income of farmers it is feared that future global warming will expand the area where high temperature damage occurs morita 2008 accordingly countermeasures are required to prevent high temperature damage to rice plants several water management techniques in which water temperature is controlled to ensure appropriate growth conditions have been proposed as countermeasures to prevent heat damage to rice crops in japan these methods include continuous irrigation with running water cirw and controlling water depth e g saturated irrigation deep water irrigation tomosho and yamashita 2009 in particular cirw using cool water has attracted considerable attention because of its potential to reduce or eliminate high temperature damage to rice cirw irrigates water at temperatures lower than those of the surrounding air and paddy water and simultaneously drains the paddy water to allow the cool water to replace the paddy water and cool the rice plant body the ministry of agriculture forestry and fisheries of japan 2008 2011 reported that use of cirw as a countermeasure against high summer temperatures reduced rice damage in japan similarly several studies arai and ito 2001 arai et al 2006 nagahata et al 2005 nagata et al 2005 miyasaka et al 2011 wada et al 2013 have investigated the relationship between cirw and high temperature damage in field experiments and found that cirw effectively reduces heat damage to rice on the other hand it has been pointed out that applications of these non conventional water management methods such as cirw inevitably affect water demand tomosho and yamashita 2009 in particular cirw requires more irrigation water than do conventional water management methods tomosho and yamashita 2009 thus applying cirw without considering the water supply may cause water use problems for the practical application of cirw it is important to establish a theoretical basis for optimum water management conditions e g irrigation rate and amount timing water depth duration which minimize water consumption but maximize the effect on the thermal environment analyses based on the physical mechanism of the formation of the thermal environment in a paddy field will provide much information on this subject previously substantial studies on the heat environment of paddy fields have been conducted and models to describe the heat environment have been developed e g inoue 1985 kim et al 2001 kondo and watanabe 1992 saptomo et al 2004 these models have been widely used and have been shown to describe the heat transfer of paddy fields with high accuracy however these models do not always take into account the effects of irrigation and assume that there is horizontally uniform water and vegetation temperature distribution inside the paddy field thus they cannot represent the horizontally varying water temperatures that have been reported in previous studies e g miyasaka et al 2011 nishida et al 2013 tsuboi and honda 1953 because the cool irrigation water is heated via heat exchange with the atmosphere rice canopy and soil as it flows through the paddy field it is inevitable that a temperature gradient will form along the longitudinal line of the field moreover the temperature distribution differs according to the irrigation rate and water depth nishida et al 2013 2015 thus to evaluate the effect of cirw on the heat environment of a paddy field not only the heat exchange with the atmosphere but also the effect of the heat convection driven by the inflow of irrigation water must be taken into account however these parameters have been considered in only a few studies thus quantitative analyses of the effects of water management on the heat environment in paddy fields are insufficient the purposes of this study were as follows 1 to derive theoretical equations to represent the water and vegetation temperatures in a paddy field and 2 to analyze the effects of irrigation conditions irrigation rate and water depth on water and vegetation temperatures by using the obtained equations to evaluate the effects of the water management methods such as cirw on the temperature environment of the paddy field first explicit formulae that were able to express not only the effects of atmospheric conditions but also those of irrigation conditions on the temperatures of paddy water and vegetation irrigated rice were derived by analytically solving the heat balance equations of the water and the vegetation including the effects of heat convection driven by irrigation the obtained equations were validated by comparisons with observed water temperature distribution in a farmer managed paddy field under cirw conditions then various calculations were conducted using these equations to analyze the effects of irrigation conditions on the water and vegetation temperatures 2 governing equations of heat balance of paddy water and vegetation a double source model kondo and watanabe 1992 which considers the heat balance at ground and vegetation separately is among the widely accepted meteorological models to express heat exchange between atmosphere and soil this model has been applied to paddy fields in many previous studies and estimates heat transfer with high accuracy kondo and watanabe 1992 maruyama and kuwagata 2008 2010 however because the original double source model of kondo and watanabe 1992 does not take into account the horizontal heat convection in a paddy field it cannot estimate the effect of cirw on the thermal environment we started by introducing a heat convection term into the double source model 2 1 heat balance equations to simplify the analysis we assumed that water flow in a paddy field is horizontal and one dimensional from the irrigation inlet through to the outlet of the paddy field that water depth and irrigation rate are constant with time and that there is no infiltration in general cirw uses much more irrigation water than conventional water management tomosho and yamashita 2009 thus irrigation rate under cirw condition is much higher than infiltration rate moreover cirw irrigates water and simultaneously drains the paddy water to allow the irrigation water to replace the paddy water thus water depth under cirw condition gradually becomes constant thus the assumptions of no infiltration and constant water depth are reasonable under cirw condition under these assumptions the heat balance equations of paddy water eq 1 and the rice canopy eq 2 are as follows 1 f v r 1 f v σ t c 4 σ t w 4 h w l e w g c w h t w t c w q t w x 2 1 f v r σ t w 4 2 1 f v σ t c 4 h c l e c where

the horizontal distance from the inlet of the paddy field m the left side terms in both of the equations are the incoming radiation to the paddy water and the vegetation respectively the last two terms in eq 1 are those newly added to the original double source model to express the effect of cirw the theoretical equations of tw and tc under cirw can be obtained by solving eq 1 and eq 2 respectively 2 2 heat fluxes the sensible heat fluxes hw and hc the latent heat fluxes lew and lec and the downward heat flux g are expressed by following equations 3 h w k h w t w t a 4 h c k h c t c

khw and khc denote sensible heat exchange coefficients from the paddy water to the atmosphere and from the vegetation to the atmosphere respectively klew and klec are the latent heat exchange coefficients from paddy water to the atmosphere and from vegetation to the atmosphere respectively because the heat exchange coefficients are proportional to bulk transfer coefficients and wind speed they are given as follows kondo and watanabe 1992 8 k h w c a ρ a c h w u 9 k h c c a ρ a c h c u 10 k l e w l ρ a c e w u 11 k l e c l ρ a c e c u where ca is the specific heat of the air jkg 1 k 1 ρ

the vegetation and the atmosphere respectively and cew and cec are the bulk transfer coefficients for latent heat flux between the paddy water and the atmosphere and between the vegetation and the atmosphere respectively the values of the bulk transfer coefficients generally depend on both the roughness lengths and the thermal stability of the airflow however including thermal stability makes it difficult to solve equations analytically because of the non linearity of the term expressing the thermal stability effect thus we simplified that the stability of the atmosphere is neutral in this case the coefficients are independent of tw and tc the four bulk transfer coefficients of the atmosphere in neutral conditions in the double source model can be calculated by the following equations

of eqs 1 and 2 were non linear equations of tw and tc because of the existence of terms for latent heat and long wave radiation to obtain the analytical solution the nonlinear terms in eqs 1 and 2 were linearized as described below the linear forms of latent heat fluxes with respect to temperature are as follows 18 l e w k l e w q s t w q a k l e w q s t t a t w t a k l e w 1 r h a q s t a k l

σ t c 4 σ t a 4 4 σ t a 3 t c t a 4 σ t a 3 t c 3 σ t a 4 the soil conduction flux is expressed by the method of bhumralkar 1975 force restore method as follows 24 g c s d s t w t k s t w t w where 25 d s λ 2 c s ω 26 k s c s ω λ 2 where cs is the heat capacity of soil jm 3 k 1 w is the frequency of oscillation 2π 86400s 1 and t w is the daily mean water temperature k ds is the imaginary soil depth that has the same temperature as that of the paddy water and ks is the heat exchange coefficient between the paddy water and deep soil whose temperature is assumed to be t w thus the first and second terms of eq 24 can be considered as the heat storage of surface soil and the heat conduction from the paddy water to the deep soil respectively 3 2 relationship between vegetation temperature and paddy water temperature assigning the linearized flux equations of eqs 19 22 and 23 to eq 2 the linearized heat balance equation of eq 2 is as follows 27 1 f v r 4 σ t a 3 t w 3 σ t a 4 2 1 f v 4 σ t

δtw because khc and klec do not depend on tw the coefficient of atc is determined only by atmospheric conditions using eq 28 tc can be obtained from tw making it possible to evaluate the effects of various water management methods such as cirw and changing water depth on leaf temperature 3 3 estimation of water temperature under no irrigation conditions the equation to calculate the paddy water temperature when there is no inflow of irrigation water can be derived by assigning q 0 to eq 1 without water convection water temperature tw does not depend on space only on time thus the linearized heat balance equation can be written as an ordinary differential equation eq 31 by introducing the linearized flux eqs 18 and 22 24 and the leaf temperature equation of eq 28 into eq 1 as follows 31 c

t c a t w given that atw and tw are independent of tw assuming atmospheric conditions are constant with time eq 31 can be solved by separation of variables under initial conditions of tw tw t 0 34 t w t t w t w t 0 t w exp a t w c w h c s d s t t 0 eq 34 indicates that the water temperature gradually converges to tw which can be regarded as the equilibrium water temperature determined by atmospheric and soil conditions 3 4 solution of water temperature during irrigation the situation of irrigation heat convection was considered under the following conditions initial paddy water temperature tw0 is assumed to be the same inside the paddy field and the boundary condition of x 0 is irrigation water with a constant temperature ti the length between the inlet and the outlet of the paddy field is given as l m since the water depth h and water flow rate in the paddy field q are assumed to be constant under these conditions the relationship between irrigation rate qin m s and q is expressed as q qin l by assigning the linearized flux equations of eqs 18 22 24 and 28 to eq 1 the heat balance equation can be written as a partial differential equation as follows c w h c s d s t w x t t a t w t w x t t w c w q t w x t x 35 0 x l 0 t 36 t w 0 t t i 0 t 37 t w x 0 t w0 0 x l here we define the heat convection velocity vt ms 1 as follows 38 v t c w q c w h c s d s eq 38 indicates that the velocity of heat conduction vt is slower than that of water v q h because of the effect of the heat storage of soil using vt eq 35 can be changed to an ordinary differential equation by a coordinate transformation as follows 39 s x v t t t t by using this transformation eq 35 becomes the same form as eq 31 as follows 40 c w h c s d s d t w s t d t a t w t w s t t w equation 40 can be solved by the same method described in section 3 3 thus the water temperature tw s t under initial conditions of tw s t0 at t t0 is written as follows 41 t w s t t w t w s t 0 t w exp a t w c w h c s d s t t 0 transforming eq 41 to that with x and t tw coordinates can be written as follows 42 t w x t t w t w x v t t t 0 t w exp a t w c w h c s d s t t 0 the water temperature of tw x vtt t 0 in eq 42 varies with the values of the x and t coordinates two cases of tw x vtt t 0 can be considered fig 1 shows characteristic lines of the solutions of tw x t on an x t plane by backtracking along the characteristic lines on fig 1 tw x vtt t 0 can be found note since we assume no infiltration and constant water depth vt in fig 1 is constant in the paddy field but when the infiltration rate and changes in water depth can not be neglected vt decreases with increase in distance from the inlet of paddy field when x is longer than vtt as shown in a in fig 1 there is no effect of heat convection from irrigation water in this case tw x vt t0 is the initial water temperature of the paddy field tw0 43 t w x v t t t 0 t w0 in this case tw x t is 44 t w x t t w t w 0 t w exp a t w c w h c s d s t similar to eq 34 eq 44 indicates that the water temperature gradually converges to the equilibrium temperature in this case water temperature is affected by water depth but not irrigation rate on the other hand when x is less than vtt as shown in b in fig 1 tw x0 vt0 t0 describes the irrigation water temperature ti 45 t w x v t t t 0 t i in this case the relationship between x and t0 is expressed as follows 46 x v t t t 0 47 t 0 t x v t substituting eqs 45 and 47 into eq 42 yields the following equation 48 t w x t t w t i t w exp a t w c w q x equation 48 indicates that the water temperature gradually reaches equilibrium temperature with as the distance from the irrigation water inlet increases and is not affected by the initial water temperature tw0 vegetation temperature can be also evaluated by substituting eqs 44 and 48 into eq 28 we defined relaxation time τ s and relaxation length ξ m as follows 49 τ a t w c w h c s d s 1 50 ζ a t w c w q 1 τ and ξ are the useful indicators of temporal and spatial changes in water temperature τ is the time during which the changes in water temperature become 1 e and ξ is the distance at which the changes in water temperature become 1 e 4 validation of analytical model 4 1 monitoring of water temperature in a rice paddy field the water temperature was monitored during the rice ripening period in august 2013 at a farmer managed paddy field in ishikawa prefecture japan nishida et al 2016 the field was rectangular 26m 78 5m with an irrigation water inlet and outlet at both ends of the longer side of the field fig 2 cirw was used by the farmer during the nighttime and changes in water temperature profiles and water depth were monitored the horizontal distributions of water temperature and irrigation water temperature were obtained by thermometers kn laboratories inc osaka japan set at nine positions along the longitudinal line and at the irrigation canal fig 2 the changes in water depth were measured by a water pressure gauge measurements were taken at 10 min intervals the irrigation rate was calculated from the water balance of the paddy field eq 51 using measured water depth change an infiltration rate 0 45mmh 1 and surface runoff from the outlet of paddy field 51 q i n δ h i q o u t h where qin is the irrigation rate mm h δh is the increase in water depth mm h i is the infiltration rate mm h qout h is the surface runoff from the outlet of paddy field mm h i was determined from changes in water depth during nighttime with no irrigation and no surface runoff qout h was calculated from water depth using the relationship between water depth and surface runoff at the outlet nishida et al 2016 4 2 calculation method because the solutions obtained in this study hold true under constant atmospheric conditions the time series of the solution should be calculated for each time interval in which the atmospheric conditions can be regarded as constant thus in this study we numerically calculated tw by using a discretized equation of eq 42 52 t w j t w j 1 t w j 1 0 t w j 1 exp a t w c w h c s d s δ t where δt is the time step subscript j indicates node number j 0 is the inlet of irrigation and superscript 0 indicates the value of the previous time step the interval between the spatial nodes δx is given as the distance that the heat convection front advances in δt 53 δ x v t δ t by using this δx the water temperature of nodes i can be calculated from the previous time step value of node i 1 the distribution of water temperature in the field from august 12 13 2013 was simulated fig 3 shows the measured water depth and irrigation rate because a rapid change in water depth occurred a few hours after the start of irrigation the simulation was performed for 10h from 8 00 pmto 6 00 am during which time the water depth and the irrigation rate were assumed to be constant fig 3 the conditions for the simulation were as follows the time step δt was given as 10min the water depth was set to 0 028m which was the measured water depth at the end of irrigation and the irrigation rate was set to 7 7mmh 1 1 68 10 4 m2s 1 which was the average irrigation rate during the irrigation period fig 3 since the irrigation rate 7 7mm h was 17 times higher than the infiltration rate 0 45mm h infiltration rate was negligible thus we assumed that vt was constant inside paddy field consequently δx was 1 56m and the total node number was 52 irrigation water temperature was the measured value air temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation were measured values obtained at the experimental paddy field located at isikawa prefectural university which is about 10km from the paddy field downward long wave radiation from the sky was estimated from the air temperature and humidity the initial water temperature and daily average water temperature in eq 33 of each node were estimated from the fitting equation obtained by the measured water temperature distributions water temperatures at 20 00 august 12 were approximated by the quadratic function of x average water temperatures during the 24h before 20 00 august 12 were approximated by the linear function of x 4 3 results the calculated and measured water temperatures as a function of time and distance from the inlet are shown in fig 4 a and b respectively the simulation successfully represented the increase in water temperature along the flow path in the field consistent with results published in previous reports e g miyasaka et al 2011 nishida et al 2013 2015 tsuboi and honda 1953 the simulation also revealed a gradual decrease in water temperature over time the calculated change in the spatial distribution of the water temperature over time showed good agreement with the measured changes the root mean square error rmse for the estimation of water temperatures was 0 39 c from these results we concluded the proposed model is capable of expressing qualitative and quantitative features of the paddy water temperature environment under cirw conditions 5 evaluations of the effect of irrigation conditions on temperature environment of paddy field the equations obtained in our study are characterized by the parameters of vt τ ξ tw and atc these parameters are affected by irrigation and meteorological conditions thus analyzing the relationships between these conditions and the parameters is useful to understand and estimate the effect of cirw on the temperature environment in a paddy field in this section examples of the relationships between certain parameters and irrigation and meteorological conditions are provided these analyses allowed us to explore the effects of various conditions on water and vegetation temperatures in a cirw paddy field the parameters used for the calculations are summarized in table 1 5 1 heat convection velocity the heat convection velocity of vt eq 49 which is a function of irrigation rate and water depth determines the distance over which the paddy water is affected by the cool irrigation water thus the value of vt is useful for evaluating the extent of the cooling effect of cirw fig 5 illustrates the relationships between vt and a irrigation rate and b water depth at the same water depth fig 5 a vt linearly increases with increasing irrigation rate e g at 3 cm water depth with irrigation rates of 3 5 and 10mm h the values of vt are 4 5 7 5 and 15 0m h respectively under the same irrigation rate vt increases with shallower water depth e g at an irrigation rate of 5mm h with water depths of 3 5 10cm values of vt are 7 5 5 8 and 3 7m h respectively increasing irrigation rate and shallower water depth both increase vt so that the cooling effect of cirw increases thus cirw with a high irrigation rate and shallower water depth is preferable to increase the cooling effect of cirw however supplying large quantities of irrigation water is typically difficult because of limited water supply thus application of cirw in shallow water depths is likely to be more practical than supplying large quantities of irrigation water 5 2 relaxation time and relaxation length the relaxation time τ eq 49 and the relaxation length ζ eq 50 determine the rate of water temperature change over time and space respectively for example when τ and ξ are doubled the time and space required to change a unit of water temperature are halved from eq 49 τ linearly increases with increasing water depth fig 6 illustrates the relationships between τ and water depth during the nighttime under six wind speed conditions for instance when the wind speed is 0 5m s values of τ with water depths of 0 1 3 5 and 10cm are 2 5 3 2 5 3 6 9 and 10 8h respectively this result means that the time required to change a unit of water temperature with water depths of 1 3 5 and 10cm are 1 3 1 8 2 4 and 3 7 times that with a water depth of 0cm on the other hand from eq 50 ξ linearly increases with increasing irrigation rate fig 7 illustrates the relationships between ξ and irrigation rate during the nighttime under six wind speed conditions for instance when the wind speed is 0 5m s values of ξ with irrigation rates of 3 5 and 10mm h are 20 5 34 2 and 68 4m respectively from the definition of eq 50 ξ is determined only by the irrigation rate thus differences in the water depth and heat convection velocity do not affect ξ when the irrigation rate is the same a decrease in water depth increases the distance that heat convection advances within a unit of time because of the increase in vt on the other hand a decrease in water depth increases the rate of change in water temperature because of the decrease in the heat capacity of paddy water because these two mechanisms balance out spatial changes in water temperature are determined only by the irrigation rate this feature is quite different from the feature of vt both τ and ξ are affected by wind speed because the parameter of atw in eq 49 and 50 is an increase function of wind speed τ and ξ decrease with increasing wind speed for example when the water depth is 3cm values of τ with wind speeds of 0 0 5 1 and 5m s are 5 3 4 6 4 2 and 2 9h respectively fig 6 when the irrigation rate is 5mm h values of ξ with wind speeds of 0 0 5 1 and 5m s are 39 6 34 2 32 2 and 21 5m respectively fig 7 an increase in wind speed increases the latent and sensible heat exchange coefficients of eq 8 and 9 so that the heat exchange by latent and sensible heat from paddy water accelerates thus an increase in wind speed shortens the time and the distance when and where the water temperature will change this result indicated that low wind speeds are preferable to high wind speeds for the cooling effect of cirw 5 3 equilibrium water and leaf temperatures the equilibrium water temperature tw defined by eq 33 determines whether water temperature increases or decreases with time and with distance from the inlet comparing the value of tw and the temperatures of paddy and irrigation water provides information to determine the optimal water management to control the water temperature in a paddy field for example when there is no irrigation when tw is similar to the intended or optimal water temperature compared to the initial water temperature shallower water depths accelerate the change in water temperature however when tw differs from the intended or optimal water temperature deeper water depths inhibit the change in water temperature in the case of cirw if the irrigation water temperature is higher than tw then the cooling effects of cirw on paddy water become less pronounced the equilibrium water and leaf temperatures are determined by meteorological conditions and soil temperatures fig 8 illustrates the relationships between equilibrium water and leaf temperatures and wind speed during the daytime and nighttime and also the air temperature the equilibrium leaf temperatures are calculated by eq 28 by assigning tw to tw the equilibrium water and leaf temperatures under low wind speed are mainly affected by solar and downward long wave radiation but under high wind speed are mainly affected by air temperature and relative humidity accordingly the equilibrium temperatures under low wind speed are lower higher during nighttime daytime than that under high wind speed as shown in fig 8 tw varies substantially depending on meteorological conditions thus the optimal water management technique should change according to the meteorological conditions 5 4 coefficient of vegetation temperature vegetation temperature is one of the most important factors in the heat damage of rice the relationship between vegetation temperature and water temperature is characterized by the parameter atc eq 29 the parameter atc varies substantially with wind speed given that the transfer coefficients of sensible and latent heat fluxes from the leaf are linear with respect to wind speed atc of eq 29 can be rewritten as follows 54 a t c k l c 2 k l c k h c k l e c u where k l c 8 1 f v σ t a 3 equation 54 indicates that atc becomes 0 5 when the wind speed is zero and decreases as the wind speed increases examples of the relationships between atc and wind speed during the daytime and nighttime are shown in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 atc decreases with increasing wind speed and is higher at nighttime than during the daytime for example values of atc under wind speeds of 0 5 1 and 3ms 1 are 0 24 0 16 and 0 07 respectively at nighttime and 0 10 0 06 and 0 02 respectively during the daytime these results indicated that a decrease in leaf temperature of 1 k under wind speeds of 0 5 1 and 3ms 1 at nighttime require decreases in paddy water temperature of 1 0 24 1 0 16 and 1 0 07 k respectively leaf temperature is typically determined by heat exchange radiation sensible heat and latent heat with the atmosphere and surface water in particular the long wave radiation flux from paddy water must be affected by cirw with cool water because this flux is dependent only on paddy water temperature decreases in water temperature induced by cirw with cool water reduce this flux resulting in lower leaf temperature on the other hand increases in wind speed increase the diffusion of turbulence increasing the effects of sensible and latent heat fluxes on leaf temperature in such cases leaf temperature is determined primarily by the air temperature thus when the air temperature is high increases in wind speed decrease the cooling effect of cirw on the other hand the effect of water temperature on rice temperature decreases during the daytime because latent heat flux exists during the daytime thus atc and the cooling effect of cirw on leaf temperature are smaller during the daytime than at nighttime under the same water temperature conditions as shown in fig 9 these results indicated that the cooling effect of cirw is effective under weak wind conditions and during the nighttime 6 conclusion in this study equations to calculate the water and vegetation temperatures in a paddy field under horizontal water flow were obtained and then used to evaluate the effect of cirw on the temperature environment of the paddy field the equations calculated the effect of irrigation conditions on changes in water and leaf temperature distribution under various meteorological soil and irrigation conditions the equations were validated by comparisons with measured values obtained in a cirw paddy field the spatial and temporal changes in the calculated water temperatures showed good agreement with observed values therefore the equations where shown to accurately represent the temperature environment in paddy fields under different water management conditions the effects of irrigation rate paddy water depth and wind speed on water and leaf temperatures were theoretically analyzed using the equations the following results were obtained 1 the area cooled by cirw was positively related to irrigation rate and negatively related to water depth thus cirw is effective for high irrigation rates and shallow water depths shallow water depths in particular are preferable for application of cirw 2 water temperature distribution within the heat convection front under cirw was affected by the irrigation rate but not by water depth 3 higher wind speed and latent heat flux from leaves decreased the effect of water temperature on leaf temperature thus the cooling of leaves by cirw is effective under weak wind conditions and during the nighttime these results are the common features of the effects of irrigation on the temperature environment thus the proposed equations and results are useful to evaluate the efficacy of water management techniques in controlling the heat environment of paddy

11574,water management techniques such as continuous irrigation with running water cirw have been used by japanese farmers to control the thermal environment for rice cropping in this study to optimize this method to control the thermal environment in paddy fields theoretical equations for predicting water and vegetation temperatures in a paddy field were obtained first the equations to calculate water and vegetation temperatures in a paddy field were obtained by solving the heat balance equations of the paddy water and vegetation taking into account the effect of horizontal heat convection driven by irrigation the equations were validated by comparisons with observed water temperatures in a conventional paddy field under cirw the calculated changes in water temperatures over time and distance showed good agreement with observed values with a root mean square error of 0 39 c this result indicated that the equations satisfactorily expressed the features of paddy water temperature under cirw next these equations were used to determine the effects of irrigation rate paddy water depth and wind speed on water and rice plant temperatures the following results were obtained 1 the area cooled by cirw was positively related to irrigation rate and negatively related to water depth 2 low water depths were preferable for application of cirw during the nighttime 3 slower wind speeds and latent heat flux from vegetation strengthened the effects of water management on vegetation temperature the proposed equations and analyses represent the common features of the effect of irrigation on water and vegetation temperatures in a paddy field and provide quantitative information about the effects of water management techniques on the thermal environment for rice cropping keywords paddy field irrigation thermal environment in paddy fields heat balance equation analytical solution heat damage of rice 1 introduction water and air temperatures in paddy fields substantially affect rice growth yield and quality in japan recent high air temperatures during the rice grain ripening period have decreased the quantity and quality of the rice crop consequently high temperatures have become a major concern for rice cultivation morita 2008 terashima et al 2001 high temperatures increase the percentages of immature and cracked rice grains nagata et al 2005 tashiro and wardlaw 1991 terashima et al 2001 these types of damage reduce the overall grade of rice in quality surveys morita 2008 and thus reduce the income of farmers it is feared that future global warming will expand the area where high temperature damage occurs morita 2008 accordingly countermeasures are required to prevent high temperature damage to rice plants several water management techniques in which water temperature is controlled to ensure appropriate growth conditions have been proposed as countermeasures to prevent heat damage to rice crops in japan these methods include continuous irrigation with running water cirw and controlling water depth e g saturated irrigation deep water irrigation tomosho and yamashita 2009 in particular cirw using cool water has attracted considerable attention because of its potential to reduce or eliminate high temperature damage to rice cirw irrigates water at temperatures lower than those of the surrounding air and paddy water and simultaneously drains the paddy water to allow the cool water to replace the paddy water and cool the rice plant body the ministry of agriculture forestry and fisheries of japan 2008 2011 reported that use of cirw as a countermeasure against high summer temperatures reduced rice damage in japan similarly several studies arai and ito 2001 arai et al 2006 nagahata et al 2005 nagata et al 2005 miyasaka et al 2011 wada et al 2013 have investigated the relationship between cirw and high temperature damage in field experiments and found that cirw effectively reduces heat damage to rice on the other hand it has been pointed out that applications of these non conventional water management methods such as cirw inevitably affect water demand tomosho and yamashita 2009 in particular cirw requires more irrigation water than do conventional water management methods tomosho and yamashita 2009 thus applying cirw without considering the water supply may cause water use problems for the practical application of cirw it is important to establish a theoretical basis for optimum water management conditions e g irrigation rate and amount timing water depth duration which minimize water consumption but maximize the effect on the thermal environment analyses based on the physical mechanism of the formation of the thermal environment in a paddy field will provide much information on this subject previously substantial studies on the heat environment of paddy fields have been conducted and models to describe the heat environment have been developed e g inoue 1985 kim et al 2001 kondo and watanabe 1992 saptomo et al 2004 these models have been widely used and have been shown to describe the heat transfer of paddy fields with high accuracy however these models do not always take into account the effects of irrigation and assume that there is horizontally uniform water and vegetation temperature distribution inside the paddy field thus they cannot represent the horizontally varying water temperatures that have been reported in previous studies e g miyasaka et al 2011 nishida et al 2013 tsuboi and honda 1953 because the cool irrigation water is heated via heat exchange with the atmosphere rice canopy and soil as it flows through the paddy field it is inevitable that a temperature gradient will form along the longitudinal line of the field moreover the temperature distribution differs according to the irrigation rate and water depth nishida et al 2013 2015 thus to evaluate the effect of cirw on the heat environment of a paddy field not only the heat exchange with the atmosphere but also the effect of the heat convection driven by the inflow of irrigation water must be taken into account however these parameters have been considered in only a few studies thus quantitative analyses of the effects of water management on the heat environment in paddy fields are insufficient the purposes of this study were as follows 1 to derive theoretical equations to represent the water and vegetation temperatures in a paddy field and 2 to analyze the effects of irrigation conditions irrigation rate and water depth on water and vegetation temperatures by using the obtained equations to evaluate the effects of the water management methods such as cirw on the temperature environment of the paddy field first explicit formulae that were able to express not only the effects of atmospheric conditions but also those of irrigation conditions on the temperatures of paddy water and vegetation irrigated rice were derived by analytically solving the heat balance equations of the water and the vegetation including the effects of heat convection driven by irrigation the obtained equations were validated by comparisons with observed water temperature distribution in a farmer managed paddy field under cirw conditions then various calculations were conducted using these equations to analyze the effects of irrigation conditions on the water and vegetation temperatures 2 governing equations of heat balance of paddy water and vegetation a double source model kondo and watanabe 1992 which considers the heat balance at ground and vegetation separately is among the widely accepted meteorological models to express heat exchange between atmosphere and soil this model has been applied to paddy fields in many previous studies and estimates heat transfer with high accuracy kondo and watanabe 1992 maruyama and kuwagata 2008 2010 however because the original double source model of kondo and watanabe 1992 does not take into account the horizontal heat convection in a paddy field it cannot estimate the effect of cirw on the thermal environment we started by introducing a heat convection term into the double source model 2 1 heat balance equations to simplify the analysis we assumed that water flow in a paddy field is horizontal and one dimensional from the irrigation inlet through to the outlet of the paddy field that water depth and irrigation rate are constant with time and that there is no infiltration in general cirw uses much more irrigation water than conventional water management tomosho and yamashita 2009 thus irrigation rate under cirw condition is much higher than infiltration rate moreover cirw irrigates water and simultaneously drains the paddy water to allow the irrigation water to replace the paddy water thus water depth under cirw condition gradually becomes constant thus the assumptions of no infiltration and constant water depth are reasonable under cirw condition under these assumptions the heat balance equations of paddy water eq 1 and the rice canopy eq 2 are as follows 1 f v r 1 f v σ t c 4 σ t w 4 h w l e w g c w h t w t c w q t w x 2 1 f v r σ t w 4 2 1 f v σ t c 4 h c l e c where

atmosphere respectively the values of the bulk transfer coefficients generally depend on both the roughness lengths and the thermal stability of the airflow however including thermal stability makes it difficult to solve equations analytically because of the non linearity of the term expressing the thermal stability effect thus we simplified that the stability of the atmosphere is neutral in this case the coefficients are independent of tw and tc the four bulk transfer coefficients of the atmosphere in neutral conditions in the double source model can be calculated by the following equations

of eqs 1 and 2 were non linear equations of tw and tc because of the existence of terms for latent heat and long wave radiation to obtain the analytical solution the nonlinear terms in eqs 1 and 2 were linearized as described below the linear forms of latent heat fluxes with respect to temperature are as follows 18 l e w k l e w q s t w q a k l e w q s t t a t w t a k l e w 1 r h a q s t a k l

that has the same temperature as that of the paddy water and ks is the heat exchange coefficient between the paddy water and deep soil whose temperature is assumed to be t w thus the first and second terms of eq 24 can be considered as the heat storage of surface soil and the heat conduction from the paddy water to the deep soil respectively 3 2 relationship between vegetation temperature and paddy water temperature assigning the linearized flux equations of eqs 19 22 and 23 to eq 2 the linearized heat balance equation of eq 2 is as follows 27 1 f v r 4 σ t a 3 t w 3 σ t a 4 2 1 f v 4 σ t

δtw because khc and klec do not depend on tw the coefficient of atc is determined only by atmospheric conditions using eq 28 tc can be obtained from tw making it possible to evaluate the effects of various water management methods such as cirw and changing water depth on leaf temperature 3 3 estimation of water temperature under no irrigation conditions the equation to calculate the paddy water temperature when there is no inflow of irrigation water can be derived by assigning q 0 to eq 1 without water convection water temperature tw does not depend on space only on time thus the linearized heat balance equation can be written as an ordinary differential equation eq 31 by introducing the linearized flux eqs 18 and 22 24 and the leaf temperature equation of eq 28 into eq 1 as follows 31 c

t c a t w given that atw and tw are independent of tw assuming atmospheric conditions are constant with time eq 31 can be solved by separation of variables under initial conditions of tw tw t 0 34 t w t t w t w t 0 t w exp a t w c w h c s d s t t 0 eq 34 indicates that the water temperature gradually converges to tw which can be regarded as the equilibrium water temperature determined by atmospheric and soil conditions 3 4 solution of water temperature during irrigation the situation of irrigation heat convection was considered under the following conditions initial paddy water temperature tw0 is assumed to be the same inside the paddy field and the boundary condition of x 0 is irrigation water with a constant temperature ti the length between the inlet and the outlet of the paddy field is given as l m since the water depth h and water flow rate in the paddy field q are assumed to be constant under these conditions the relationship between irrigation rate qin m s and q is expressed as q qin l by assigning the linearized flux equations of eqs 18 22 24 and 28 to eq 1 the heat balance equation can be written as a partial differential equation as follows c w h c s d s t w x t t a t w t w x t t w c w q t w x t x 35 0 x l 0 t 36 t w 0 t t i 0 t 37 t w x 0 t w0 0 x l here we define the heat convection velocity vt ms 1 as follows 38 v t c w q c w h c s d s eq 38 indicates that the velocity of heat conduction vt is slower than that of water v q h because of the effect of the heat storage of soil using vt eq 35 can be changed to an ordinary differential equation by a coordinate transformation as follows 39 s x v t t t t by using this transformation eq 35 becomes the same form as eq 31 as follows 40 c w h c s d s d t w s t d t a t w t w s t t w equation 40 can be solved by the same method described in section 3 3 thus the water temperature tw s t under initial conditions of tw s t0 at t t0 is written as follows 41 t w s t t w t w s t 0 t w exp a t w c w h c s d s t t 0 transforming eq 41 to that with x and t tw coordinates can be written as follows 42 t w x t t w t w x v t t t 0 t w exp a t w c w h c s d s t t 0 the water temperature of tw x vtt t 0 in eq 42 varies with the values of the x and t coordinates two cases of tw x vtt t 0 can be considered fig 1 shows characteristic lines of the solutions of tw x t on an x t plane by backtracking along the characteristic lines on fig 1 tw x vtt t 0 can be found note since we assume no infiltration and constant water depth vt in fig 1 is constant in the paddy field but when the infiltration rate and changes in water depth can not be neglected vt decreases with increase in distance from the inlet of paddy field when x is longer than vtt as shown in a in fig 1 there is no effect of heat convection from irrigation water in this case tw x vt t0 is the initial water temperature of the paddy field tw0 43 t w x v t t t 0 t w0 in this case tw x t is 44 t w x t t w t w 0 t w exp a t w c w h c s d s t similar to eq 34 eq 44 indicates that the water temperature gradually converges to the equilibrium temperature in this case water temperature is affected by water depth but not irrigation rate on the other hand when x is less than vtt as shown in b in fig 1 tw x0 vt0 t0 describes the irrigation water temperature ti 45 t w x v t t t 0 t i in this case the relationship between x and t0 is expressed as follows 46 x v t t t 0 47 t 0 t x v t substituting eqs 45 and 47 into eq 42 yields the following equation 48 t w x t t w t i t w exp a t w c w q x equation 48 indicates that the water temperature gradually reaches equilibrium temperature with as the distance from the irrigation water inlet increases and is not affected by the initial water temperature tw0 vegetation temperature can be also evaluated by substituting eqs 44 and 48 into eq 28 we defined relaxation time τ s and relaxation length ξ m as follows 49 τ a t w c w h c s d s 1 50 ζ a t w c w q 1 τ and ξ are the useful indicators of temporal and spatial changes in water temperature τ is the time during which the changes in water temperature become 1 e and ξ is the distance at which the changes in water temperature become 1 e 4 validation of analytical model 4 1 monitoring of water temperature in a rice paddy field the water temperature was monitored during the rice ripening period in august 2013 at a farmer managed paddy field in ishikawa prefecture japan nishida et al 2016 the field was rectangular 26m 78 5m with an irrigation water inlet and outlet at both ends of the longer side of the field fig 2 cirw was used by the farmer during the nighttime and changes in water temperature profiles and water depth were monitored the horizontal distributions of water temperature and irrigation water temperature were obtained by thermometers kn laboratories inc osaka japan set at nine positions along the longitudinal line and at the irrigation canal fig 2 the changes in water depth were measured by a water pressure gauge measurements were taken at 10 min intervals the irrigation rate was calculated from the water balance of the paddy field eq 51 using measured water depth change an infiltration rate 0 45mmh 1 and surface runoff from the outlet of paddy field 51 q i n δ h i q o u t h where qin is the irrigation rate mm h δh is the increase in water depth mm h i is the infiltration rate mm h qout h is the surface runoff from the outlet of paddy field mm h i was determined from changes in water depth during nighttime with no irrigation and no surface runoff qout h was calculated from water depth using the relationship between water depth and surface runoff at the outlet nishida et al 2016 4 2 calculation method because the solutions obtained in this study hold true under constant atmospheric conditions the time series of the solution should be calculated for each time interval in which the atmospheric conditions can be regarded as constant thus in this study we numerically calculated tw by using a discretized equation of eq 42 52 t w j t w j 1 t w j 1 0 t w j 1 exp a t w c w h c s d s δ t where δt is the time step subscript j indicates node number j 0 is the inlet of irrigation and superscript 0 indicates the value of the previous time step the interval between the spatial nodes δx is given as the distance that the heat convection front advances in δt 53 δ x v t δ t by using this δx the water temperature of nodes i can be calculated from the previous time step value of node i 1 the distribution of water temperature in the field from august 12 13 2013 was simulated fig 3 shows the measured water depth and irrigation rate because a rapid change in water depth occurred a few hours after the start of irrigation the simulation was performed for 10h from 8 00 pmto 6 00 am during which time the water depth and the irrigation rate were assumed to be constant fig 3 the conditions for the simulation were as follows the time step δt was given as 10min the water depth was set to 0 028m which was the measured water depth at the end of irrigation and the irrigation rate was set to 7 7mmh 1 1 68 10 4 m2s 1 which was the average irrigation rate during the irrigation period fig 3 since the irrigation rate 7 7mm h was 17 times higher than the infiltration rate 0 45mm h infiltration rate was negligible thus we assumed that vt was constant inside paddy field consequently δx was 1 56m and the total node number was 52 irrigation water temperature was the measured value air temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation were measured values obtained at the experimental paddy field located at isikawa prefectural university which is about 10km from the paddy field downward long wave radiation from the sky was estimated from the air temperature and humidity the initial water temperature and daily average water temperature in eq 33 of each node were estimated from the fitting equation obtained by the measured water temperature distributions water temperatures at 20 00 august 12 were approximated by the quadratic function of x average water temperatures during the 24h before 20 00 august 12 were approximated by the linear function of x 4 3 results the calculated and measured water temperatures as a function of time and distance from the inlet are shown in fig 4 a and b respectively the simulation successfully represented the increase in water temperature along the flow path in the field consistent with results published in previous reports e g miyasaka et al 2011 nishida et al 2013 2015 tsuboi and honda 1953 the simulation also revealed a gradual decrease in water temperature over time the calculated change in the spatial distribution of the water temperature over time showed good agreement with the measured changes the root mean square error rmse for the estimation of water temperatures was 0 39 c from these results we concluded the proposed model is capable of expressing qualitative and quantitative features of the paddy water temperature environment under cirw conditions 5 evaluations of the effect of irrigation conditions on temperature environment of paddy field the equations obtained in our study are characterized by the parameters of vt τ ξ tw and atc these parameters are affected by irrigation and meteorological conditions thus analyzing the relationships between these conditions and the parameters is useful to understand and estimate the effect of cirw on the temperature environment in a paddy field in this section examples of the relationships between certain parameters and irrigation and meteorological conditions are provided these analyses allowed us to explore the effects of various conditions on water and vegetation temperatures in a cirw paddy field the parameters used for the calculations are summarized in table 1 5 1 heat convection velocity the heat convection velocity of vt eq 49 which is a function of irrigation rate and water depth determines the distance over which the paddy water is affected by the cool irrigation water thus the value of vt is useful for evaluating the extent of the cooling effect of cirw fig 5 illustrates the relationships between vt and a irrigation rate and b water depth at the same water depth fig 5 a vt linearly increases with increasing irrigation rate e g at 3 cm water depth with irrigation rates of 3 5 and 10mm h the values of vt are 4 5 7 5 and 15 0m h respectively under the same irrigation rate vt increases with shallower water depth e g at an irrigation rate of 5mm h with water depths of 3 5 10cm values of vt are 7 5 5 8 and 3 7m h respectively increasing irrigation rate and shallower water depth both increase vt so that the cooling effect of cirw increases thus cirw with a high irrigation rate and shallower water depth is preferable to increase the cooling effect of cirw however supplying large quantities of irrigation water is typically difficult because of limited water supply thus application of cirw in shallow water depths is likely to be more practical than supplying large quantities of irrigation water 5 2 relaxation time and relaxation length the relaxation time τ eq 49 and the relaxation length ζ eq 50 determine the rate of water temperature change over time and space respectively for example when τ and ξ are doubled the time and space required to change a unit of water temperature are halved from eq 49 τ linearly increases with increasing water depth fig 6 illustrates the relationships between τ and water depth during the nighttime under six wind speed conditions for instance when the wind speed is 0 5m s values of τ with water depths of 0 1 3 5 and 10cm are 2 5 3 2 5 3 6 9 and 10 8h respectively this result means that the time required to change a unit of water temperature with water depths of 1 3 5 and 10cm are 1 3 1 8 2 4 and 3 7 times that with a water depth of 0cm on the other hand from eq 50 ξ linearly increases with increasing irrigation rate fig 7 illustrates the relationships between ξ and irrigation rate during the nighttime under six wind speed conditions for instance when the wind speed is 0 5m s values of ξ with irrigation rates of 3 5 and 10mm h are 20 5 34 2 and 68 4m respectively from the definition of eq 50 ξ is determined only by the irrigation rate thus differences in the water depth and heat convection velocity do not affect ξ when the irrigation rate is the same a decrease in water depth increases the distance that heat convection advances within a unit of time because of the increase in vt on the other hand a decrease in water depth increases the rate of change in water temperature because of the decrease in the heat capacity of paddy water because these two mechanisms balance out spatial changes in water temperature are determined only by the irrigation rate this feature is quite different from the feature of vt both τ and ξ are affected by wind speed because the parameter of atw in eq 49 and 50 is an increase function of wind speed τ and ξ decrease with increasing wind speed for example when the water depth is 3cm values of τ with wind speeds of 0 0 5 1 and 5m s are 5 3 4 6 4 2 and 2 9h respectively fig 6 when the irrigation rate is 5mm h values of ξ with wind speeds of 0 0 5 1 and 5m s are 39 6 34 2 32 2 and 21 5m respectively fig 7 an increase in wind speed increases the latent and sensible heat exchange coefficients of eq 8 and 9 so that the heat exchange by latent and sensible heat from paddy water accelerates thus an increase in wind speed shortens the time and the distance when and where the water temperature will change this result indicated that low wind speeds are preferable to high wind speeds for the cooling effect of cirw 5 3 equilibrium water and leaf temperatures the equilibrium water temperature tw defined by eq 33 determines whether water temperature increases or decreases with time and with distance from the inlet comparing the value of tw and the temperatures of paddy and irrigation water provides information to determine the optimal water management to control the water temperature in a paddy field for example when there is no irrigation when tw is similar to the intended or optimal water temperature compared to the initial water temperature shallower water depths accelerate the change in water temperature however when tw differs from the intended or optimal water temperature deeper water depths inhibit the change in water temperature in the case of cirw if the irrigation water temperature is higher than tw then the cooling effects of cirw on paddy water become less pronounced the equilibrium water and leaf temperatures are determined by meteorological conditions and soil temperatures fig 8 illustrates the relationships between equilibrium water and leaf temperatures and wind speed during the daytime and nighttime and also the air temperature the equilibrium leaf temperatures are calculated by eq 28 by assigning tw to tw the equilibrium water and leaf temperatures under low wind speed are mainly affected by solar and downward long wave radiation but under high wind speed are mainly affected by air temperature and relative humidity accordingly the equilibrium temperatures under low wind speed are lower higher during nighttime daytime than that under high wind speed as shown in fig 8 tw varies substantially depending on meteorological conditions thus the optimal water management technique should change according to the meteorological conditions 5 4 coefficient of vegetation temperature vegetation temperature is one of the most important factors in the heat damage of rice the relationship between vegetation temperature and water temperature is characterized by the parameter atc eq 29 the parameter atc varies substantially with wind speed given that the transfer coefficients of sensible and latent heat fluxes from the leaf are linear with respect to wind speed atc of eq 29 can be rewritten as follows 54 a t c k l c 2 k l c k h c k l e c u where k l c 8 1 f v σ t a 3 equation 54 indicates that atc becomes 0 5 when the wind speed is zero and decreases as the wind speed increases examples of the relationships between atc and wind speed during the daytime and nighttime are shown in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 atc decreases with increasing wind speed and is higher at nighttime than during the daytime for example values of atc under wind speeds of 0 5 1 and 3ms 1 are 0 24 0 16 and 0 07 respectively at nighttime and 0 10 0 06 and 0 02 respectively during the daytime these results indicated that a decrease in leaf temperature of 1 k under wind speeds of 0 5 1 and 3ms 1 at nighttime require decreases in paddy water temperature of 1 0 24 1 0 16 and 1 0 07 k respectively leaf temperature is typically determined by heat exchange radiation sensible heat and latent heat with the atmosphere and surface water in particular the long wave radiation flux from paddy water must be affected by cirw with cool water because this flux is dependent only on paddy water temperature decreases in water temperature induced by cirw with cool water reduce this flux resulting in lower leaf temperature on the other hand increases in wind speed increase the diffusion of turbulence increasing the effects of sensible and latent heat fluxes on leaf temperature in such cases leaf temperature is determined primarily by the air temperature thus when the air temperature is high increases in wind speed decrease the cooling effect of cirw on the other hand the effect of water temperature on rice temperature decreases during the daytime because latent heat flux exists during the daytime thus atc and the cooling effect of cirw on leaf temperature are smaller during the daytime than at nighttime under the same water temperature conditions as shown in fig 9 these results indicated that the cooling effect of cirw is effective under weak wind conditions and during the nighttime 6 conclusion in this study equations to calculate the water and vegetation temperatures in a paddy field under horizontal water flow were obtained and then used to evaluate the effect of cirw on the temperature environment of the paddy field the equations calculated the effect of irrigation conditions on changes in water and leaf temperature distribution under various meteorological soil and irrigation conditions the equations were validated by comparisons with measured values obtained in a cirw paddy field the spatial and temporal changes in the calculated water temperatures showed good agreement with observed values therefore the equations where shown to accurately represent the temperature environment in paddy fields under different water management conditions the effects of irrigation rate paddy water depth and wind speed on water and leaf temperatures were theoretically analyzed using the equations the following results were obtained 1 the area cooled by cirw was positively related to irrigation rate and negatively related to water depth thus cirw is effective for high irrigation rates and shallow water depths shallow water depths in particular are preferable for application of cirw 2 water temperature distribution within the heat convection front under cirw was affected by the irrigation rate but not by water depth 3 higher wind speed and latent heat flux from leaves decreased the effect of water temperature on leaf temperature thus the cooling of leaves by cirw is effective under weak wind conditions and during the nighttime these results are the common features of the effects of irrigation on the temperature environment thus the proposed equations and results are useful to evaluate the efficacy of water management techniques in controlling the heat environment of paddy
