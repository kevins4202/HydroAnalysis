11150,wheat is the second most important food crop in india and world one of the major difficulties faced in the wheat growing regions is the depletion of water resources at an alarming rate this study was conducted to test the hypothesis that the use of the reduced amount of irrigation water would maintain the grain yield of popular indian wheat variety hd2967 water use crop yield and water use efficiency of wheat were evaluated for three consecutive years under thirteen different irrigation treatments highest yield 5372 4 kgha 1 was recorded when crop was irrigated with full irrigation 60 mm of water at all five critical crop growth stages which were statistically at par to yields recorded under 25 deficit irrigation 45 mm at all growth stages the treatment with 50 irrigation 30 mm at all five growth stages although saved 50 water yield penalty was also significant 4788 1 kgha 1 10 9 loss treatments with normal recommended practice 60 mm have achieved lower water use efficiency wue values 1 88 kg m 3 whereas 25 deficit irrigation i e 45 mm at all five stages recorded significantly higher wue 2 23 kgm 3 in sandy loam soils the treatment where a total of 750 m3 water was saved per hectare was the most remunerative option in addition to saving of cost on water electricity and labour adoption of 45 mm irrigation at all crop growth stages can enhance both irrigation water use efficiency without any yield penalty and can be adopted as a water saving mechanism in the regions of depleting water resources keywords wheat yield water use efficiency wue deficit irrigation water use wu 1 introduction indiscriminate utilization of groundwater for irrigation has led to widespread over exploitation of groundwater resources rodell et al 2009 which is unsustainable in the long run india is the world s largest user of groundwater mukherjee et al 2015 and consumes 25 of the global share which is more than china and usa combined margat and van der gun 2013 the rates at which the ground water levels are falling is probably the fastest globally aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 during the last three decades underground water levels in north western parts of india have fallen from 8 to 16 m below ground level mbgl and in rest of india it has declined from 1 to 8 mbgl sekhri 2013 another estimate reports that north western india lost 10 9 104 giga litres of groundwater between 2002 and 2008 rodell et al 2009 additionally irrigation efficiency is less than 40 in south asia ali 2012 and in india it is 35 rosegrant 1997 this low irrigation efficiency is mainly because up to 50 water is being lost due to leakage seepage and to the system inefficiencies hamdy et al 2003 sivanappan 1994 wallace 2000 wheat is a prime staple food crop of india and has a major share in the food basket 99 7 million ton in 2017 18 being a winter season crop october to april wheat needs irrigation as 80 percent of the annual precipitation is received during the monsoon season july to september due to scanty rainfall pattern wheat depends on groundwater and hence it is mostly produced under irrigated conditions the current water productivity of wheat was estimated to be of 1 06 kg m 3 zwart et al 2010 0 8 1 0 kg m 3 meena et al 2015 in india therefore the present situation calls for identifying efficient water use measures in wheat cultivation wheat requires adequate soil moisture for normal growth and development at all growth stages which is possible through precision irrigation scheduling to reduce over irrigation meena et al 2018 excessive water application can result in waterlogging and leaching of nutrients beyond the root zone to improve water use efficiency there must be proper irrigation scheduling with just enough water as flooding may lead to the reduction in wue qiu et al 2008 and sometimes in productivity also the use of adequate water at critical growth stages is regarded as a superior practice over traditional flooding where the crop fields are filled with enormous volumes of water earlier reports suggesting benefits of using deficit irrigation to save water in maize peake et al 2008 stockle and james 1989 wheat lobell and ortiz monasterio 2006 peake et al 2016 and under dry farming system oweis and hachum 2006 are available however most of these are either predictions based on simulation models or dealt with regions other than indo gangetic plains of india little is known about the effect of the reduced amount of irrigation water on performance of wheat in high input use regions of india however there are few earlier reports on irrigation scheduling taking wue as major objective in wheat jalota et al 2006 panda et al 2003 panda et al 2003 evaluated wheat at different irrigation treatments decided based on soil water status measured using neutron probe where he reported that wheat wue was highest when irrigation was given at 45 depletion of available soil moisture in cotton wheat cropping system jalota et al 2006 reported reducing the number of irrigations to achieve maximum crop water productivity they further indicated that grain development stage as the most critical stage to be irrigated if a farmer has access to limited irrigation source therefore the objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the use of the reduced amount of irrigation water would maintain the grain yield of wheat in semi arid environments of north western plain zone of india where annual evaporation 1560 mm is nearly double the annual precipitation 744 mm further our aim was to determine the effect of reduced amount of irrigation water at critical growth stages on grain yield yield components and wue of wheat 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site experiment was conducted for three consecutive years commencing from 2015 16 to 2017 18 wheat growing seasons at research farm of icar indian institute of wheat and barley research karnal 29 43 n 76 58 e 245 m above mean sea level haryana india semi arid and sub tropical climate prevails in the experimental area with hot dry to wet summers may to october and cool dry winters november to april the average annual maximum and minimum air

gravimetric method black 1965 was 17 5 2 2 experimental design the experiment was conducted with thirteen irrigation treatment combinations varying in the amount of irrigation water applied descriptions of treatments are presented in table 1 using the randomized block design with three replications in a 2 8 m2 plot size the experiment was planted in the month of november 23 11 2015 25 11 2016 and 28 11 2017 respectively using a tractor operated precision seed drill which in one run plants 10 rows and maintains a uniform inter row spacing of 20 cm it also distributes seeds uniformly within rows with the help of an electric distributor the standard recommended anonymous 2014a seed rate of 100 kgha 1 was followed to get a uniform plant population of 250 plants m 2 the crop attained anthesis stage between 90 102 days in all the three seasons the crop was harvested in the month of april 20 04 2016 12 04 2017 and 21 04 2018 respectively nutrients like 150 kg n 60 kg p2o5 and 30 kg k2o ha 1 were applied through n p2o5 k2o complex fertilizer 12 32 16 and urea phosphorus and potassium were applied as a basal dose while the remaining nitrogen was top dressed in two equal splits through urea along with first and second irrigations weeds disease and insect control were uniformly managed during the crop growing season all other crop management techniques followed the regional recommended practices anonymous 2014b 2 3 weather parameters the data on important weather parameters such as daily minimum and maximum temperature precipitation were recorded through the crop season during the experimental years 2015 16 2016 17 and 2017 18 the long term data of weather parameters for the period between 1981 to 2018 were obtained from the data repository maintained by icar central soil salinity research institute karnal the long term temperature minimum and maximum and precipitation data were used to calculate the long term average values 2 4 irrigation treatments the method of irrigation at each growth stage involved pumping of water from a tubewell and carried to the experimental field via gravity flow in irrigation channels running adjacent to the experimental plots the existing practice of irrigation in indo gangetic plains of india in which at least 60 mm of water is being applied by surface flooding method for 5 6 times during crop season depending on the weather and soil conditions was chosen as control treatment in this study this is as per the package of practice recommended to the farmers of the region and currently it is 60 mm per irrigation deo et al 2017 singh 2016 water application was based on the estimated crop water requirement calculated over the entire growing season irrigation treatments were precisely imposed on each plot by measuring the amount of irrigation water applied using a parshall flume discharge measurement flume a parshall flume measures the discharge of irrigation water passing through the canal of the flume first height of the water level in the flume was recorded and this height was converted to discharge with the conversion chart a three inch parshall flume was installed once at the entrance of the supply channel and the upstream inlet of experimental plots the amount of water applied using parshall flume was calculated using the following equation 1 q 0 00138h2 h where q is the discharge in litres per second and h is the height of water level in cm this discharge was allowed to flow into one plot at a time with the aid of a calculator and a stopwatch the flow into each plot and the time required to apply the desired depth of water was immediately calculated as soon as the water was guided into the plot immediately after the desired depth is applied to a given plot the discharge was cut off by closing the channel banks to stop water from entering the plots the irrigation was applied from early december to early april in the dry season each critical growth stage of crop was exposed to stress by applying deficit irrigation irrigation treatments were established based on the different growth stages of wheat viz crown root initiation cri maximum tillering jointing flowering and milk stage there were 13 irrigation treatments including full irrigation i e 60 mm at all stages as the control the treatments and irrigation levels have been listed in table 1 2 5 data recording to avoid border effects side rows and 0 5 m from each end of the plot was harvested the remaining net plot of 11 2 m2 1 6 m 7 m was harvested for recording above ground biomass agbm and yield the crop was hand harvested by cutting at ground level when grains matured and the straw had turned yellow data on biological yield were recorded after sun drying of the harvested crop the sun dried bundles were threshed and winnowed and the grains so obtained were weighed and yield for different treatments was adjusted at 14 moisture for appropriate comparison harvest index hi was calculated as the ratio of the grain weight to the total agbm grain samples were randomly collected for thousand grains weight tgw and counted by using contador seed counter and weighed to record tgw tillers per square meter tpm were counted at physiological maturity from each plot plant height was measured by picking the plants randomly and carefully from middle three rows by avoiding one meter length from either of the corners of the middle rows water productivity water use efficiency is the physical accounting of water with yield or economic output so as to assess how much value is being obtained from the use of per unit water for this analysis water use efficiency was calculated as 2 water use efficiency wue output q where wue is the productivity of water in kgm 3 output is the productivity of wheat in kgha 1 and q is the amount of water used by the crop in m3 ha 1 partial gross margin for comparing the returns from each treatments was carried out using the following equation from stark et al 2000 3 pgm y p w where pgm partial gross margin y yield of wheat per hectare p average price of wheat w cost of irrigation water in haryana 2 6 data analysis the general linear model glm procedure in sas 9 3 version 6 1 7061 for windows cary nc sas institute inc 2012 was used to perform statistical analysis means for main and interaction effects were separated using tukey s studentized range test at 0 05 0 01 and 0 001 levels of significance correlation analysis was performed on selected growth variables against water used to determine the degree of relationship and their contribution to variation in yields in deficit irrigation levels pearson s correlation coefficient r was used to indicate the interaction of grain yield yield parameters and wue with water use 3 results 3 1 climatic conditions the amount and temporal distribution of rainfall through the wheat growing season play a very important role in wheat cultivation the rainfall data of the experimental years during the wheat growing season was compared with the long term average rainfall values the long term rainfall data revealed that every year at karnal location receives on an average about 120 mm of precipitation during the wheat growing season fig 2 among all the three experimental years 2016 17 wheat season received the maximum rainfall of 97 mm and when compared to lta this was shortfall by 23 mm the next highest amount of precipitation received was during the third year of experiment i e 2017 18 85 mm which was only 71 of lta the least precipitation among the three years was received during 2015 16 55 7 mm which was short of 64 mm to lta rainfall recorded at karnal the distribution of rainfall through the wheat growing season was found to be scanty by the occurrence of spells of heavy rainfall in a short span of time followed by dry weather for a long period for example during the 2015 2016 growing season the total rainfall of 56 mm was received only in two spells and that too 46 mm of it was received during march march lta 5 mm while in 2016 17 season 86 mm of total 97 mm precipitation 88 was received in a single month of january which was 56 mm more than lta rainfall of january 28 mm the experimental years were comparable to lta in terms of the minimum and maximum temperatures and it can be observed that the minimum and maximum temperatures have increased by 1 2 c during february to april months when compared to lta fig 1 3 2 grain yield agbm harvest index tgw and tpm 3 2 1 grain yield the grain yield agbm and harvest index values of the treatments during the experimental years 2015 2018 have been summarized in table 2 data obtained from the 3 year study showed that grain yield was significantly p 0 01 affected by soil water deficits highest mean grain yield 5448 0 kgha 1 was obtained during 2015 16 a 10 5 decrease was observed in the grain yield of 2016 17 4878 9 kgha 1 and in 2017 18 mean grain yield across irrigation treatments 5191 7 kgha 1 was reduced by 4 6 the highest grain yield was obtained from the control treatment followed by 75 its 75 ims and 50 ics treatments although the differences among them were at par the differences in yield were at par in treatments involving 25 reduced irrigation or in 75 ias treatment the yield penalty was significant under treatment 50 ias when control treatment was imposed at all five crop growth stages the pooled mean yield over the three years was maximum 5372 4 kgha 1 compared to all other treatments in the treatment 75 ias the grain yield recorded was 5196 3 kgha 1 which was 96 7 of control and statistically at par with the yields obtained in the control treatment in comparison to the control in the 50 ias treatment mean grain yield over three years of experiment indicated a statistically significant decrease by 10 9 4788 1 kgha 1 when irrigation treatments 2 5 in table 2 were compared 75 its was least affected by attaining minimum yield penalty 60 kg ha 1 1 1 however the differences in mean yields among these treatments were insignificant table 2 4 6 240 kg ha 1 yield reduction was observed under 75 ics which was maximum reduction among the 75 irrigation treatments in contrast 50 ics resulted in opposite results compared to 75 ics here the treatment 50 ics yielded 5217 3 kg ha 1and had least yield penalty 2 9 compared to the control treatment 3 2 2 above ground biomass agbm the experimental mean agbm yield across the three years 2015 2018 was compared highest mean agbm yield 12 33 t ha 1 was obtained during 2017 2018 followed by 2015 2016 12 13 t ha 1 whereas during the 2016 2017 a considerable decrease by 9 2 over the other two years table 2 was recorded 11 01 t ha 1 the mean agbm yield over the three years was significantly affected when 50 irrigation was applied at all growth stages 50 ias 10 69 t ha 1 in comparison to control 12 48 t ha 1 mean agbm yield over three years of control treatment was maximum 12 44 t ha 1 as compared to all other twelve treatments although the differences were statistically insignificant except in case of 50 ias treatment the agbm yield of 75 ias pooled over the three years was 11 77 t ha 1 this was 94 3 of agbm obtained in control treatment and the differences between them were insignificant the agbm pooled over the three years under 50 ias treatment a significant decrease of 14 3 10 69 t ha 1 than control treatment 12 44 t ha 1 was observed stage specific treatments 2 5 in table 2 revealed that tillering stage 75 its was least affected in terms of minimum agbm reduction 0 29 t ha 1 2 3 however the differences in mean agbm among the treatments were insignificant table 2 the deficit irrigation at jointing stage 75 ijs accumulated least agbm 11 32 t ha 1 and the reduction was 9 3 when compared to control treatment among the 50 irrigation treatments 7 11 in table 2 none produced significantly differing agbm in this case the treatment at the milking stage 50 ims was the least affected stage producing 12 09 tha 1 agbm which was 3 1 less than control treatment while treatment at jointing 50 ijs was the most affected stage which accumulated 6 1 less agbm 11 72 tha 1 than control treatment 3 2 3 harvest index the mean harvest index hi value of the present study pooled over the three years was 0 44 while it ranged between 0 42 and 0 45 the hi values of the treatments exposed to 50 and 75 irrigation were higher than the hi values of control treatment the trend increased with decreasing quantity of irrigation water hi values of treatment with 75 irrigation at jointing stage 75 ijs were significantly higher 0 46 than control treatment 0 43 3 2 4 thousand grains weight tgw the mean tgw value in the present study pooled over the three years was 35 6 g while the range varied between 33 9 g and 37 0 g the highest tgw was produced under treatment 50 its 37 0 g followed by 75 ims 36 7 g and 75 ias 36 4 g even though the differences among the treatments were insignificant the 75 ias treatment produced 36 4 g tgw which was higher than the control treatment 35 8 g 3 2 5 tillers per square meter tpm the mean tpm values pooled over the three years was 491 while the range varied between 454 and 531 the pooled tpm data over the three years indicated that the highest tpm was produced under control treatment 531 followed by 75 ims 516 and 50 ics 506 tpm was reduced considerably in treatments where 50 irrigation was imposed at maximum tillering stage 50 its 454 and 50 ias 464 the tpm values did not reduce significantly when irrigation reduced by 15 mm at all growth stages separately or collectively other than maximum tillering the 50 irrigation 30 mm at the maximum tillering stage and at all growth stages reduced tillering significantly 3 2 6 kernel number per square meter knpsm the mean knpsm values over three years experiment was 14680 while the range varied between 14 005 and 15 314 treatment 75 its produced highest knpsm and control treatment followed the order by recording 15 197 kernels 50 its recorded minimum knpsm which was significantly lower compared to the control treatment and also the 75 its 3 3 water use efficiency water use efficiency values estimated for the irrigation treatments have been presented in table 3 the data revealed that the pooled mean wue values of the experimental treatments over the three years vary in the range of 1 84 2 66 kgm 3 and clearly the reduced irrigation treatments have shown the increase in wue values and in contrast the control treatment has achieved lower wue values the highest wue values were observed in 50 ias 2 66 kgm 3 followed by 75 ias treatment 2 23 kgm 3 and among the stage specific treatments 75 ims had recorded maximum wue 1 93 kgm 3 while 50 ics recorded maximum wue 2 04 kgm 3 followed by 50 ims treatment 2 01 kgm 3 the results also revealed that 75 ifs and 50 ifs treatments recorded the minimum wue values 3 4 correlation analysis pearson s correlation was computed for understanding the association between yield and other traits and amount of water used wu at different growth stages table 4 across years and treatments analysis showed that the decrease in wu was found to have a strong negative influence on tgw i e higher grain weight was associated with lower wu a meager negative correlation was detected between the hi and wu while the correlation of plant height ph was positive but with a minimum significance level computation of treatment wise correlation of traits studied with wu resulted in a reasonable negative correlation between yield and 50 irrigation wu at tillering and flowering which means a minimum yield penalty was observed under 50 its and 50 ifs treatments irrigation treatments had a substantial negative effect on tgw as it can be observed under 75 ias treatment where tgw was found to have increased significantly p 0 001 among the stage specific 75 irrigation treatments 75 ijs and other treatments had a moderate negative effect on tgw p 0 006 except 50 ifs which had a low negative correlation another trait which was most influenced by reduced irrigation treatments was tpm a strong negative correlation p 0 001 was found between tpm and wu in treatment 50 its followed by 75 ics p 0 009 the 50 irrigation treatments at tillering jointing and flowering had witnessed an increased wue with a strong negative correlation 3 5 partial gross margins by saving irrigation water the partial gross margins from each of the treatment was compared taking into account the cost irrigation water in haryana india as reported by cornish et al 2004 and wichelns 2010 the cost of irrigation water per 1000 m3 ranged from usd 3 in mexico to usd 38 in china and it was usd 71 in haryana the partial gross margins earned in different treatments have been presented in table 5 the estimation shows that the 75 ias treatment was the most viable strategy to save maximum water with minimum effect on yield further the 75 ias treatment was found to be the most profitable by producing a partial gross margin of usd 1118 ha 1 while the control treatment produced usd1108 ha 1 4 discussion availability of electricity for irrigation purpose is highly subsidized tariff free provision of government policies for agriculture in india and other south asian countries which has led to the excess use of water leading to over exploitation of underground water resources therefore the existing practice of irrigating 60 mm of water per irrigation deo et al 2017 singh 2016 was perceived to be excess and is used as control treatment in this study further the aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that whether reducing the amount of irrigation water judiciously by regulated deficit irrigation at critical growth stages of wheat will enhance the water use efficiency in addition to not much effect on yield the strategy would also add to reducing the cost of cultivation incurred on water electricity and labour used for irrigating wheat the labor and electricity costs involved in irrigating crop are a significant component of cost of cultivation there are few earlier studies in india jalota et al 2006 panda et al 2003 that dealt on measuring water productivity under reduced irrigation conditions in wheat the soil water depletion measured through neutron probe by panda et al 2003 where they reported that wheat wue was highest at 45 depletion of available soil moisture while jalota et al 2006 used a simulation model to predict crop water productivity by reducing the number of irrigations in cotton wheat cropping system they further indicated that grain development stage as the most critical stage in wheat in this study the main purpose of deficit irrigation was to apply water just to meet the appropriate crop water demand rather than applying excess water as a luxury the grain yield of the experiment ranged from 4788 to 5314 kg ha 1 and was comparable to the earlier predicted reports from the study region arora et al 2007 timsina et al 2008 the mean experimental grain yield data varied between the three years and the second year 2016 17 mean yield 4878 9 kg ha 1 was lowest compared to the other two years the reason for this reduction may be attributed to the fact that a spell of heavy rainfall of 58 8 mm was received during the fourth julian week january 2017 leading to the waterlogged condition as well as lodging to some extent 30 during grain filling period due to high wind speed at the time of irrigation which might have hampered attainment of full yield potential of the cultivar several other studies also observed that irregular rainfall patterns affected yield due to waterlogging marti et al 2015 peake et al 2014 torrion and stougaard 2017 tripathi et al 2005 over the years 2015 2018 analysis showed that yields obtained in different treatments were insignificant except the treatment 50 ias which witnessed 11 yield reduction compared to control treatment the general trend of yield reduction was as expected i e early crop growth stages had small soil moisture requirement for crop establishment and treatments with 75 irrigation of 45 mm water was enough for crop growth further 50 irrigation treatments 30 mm at early growth stages affected crop yield this finding is in corroboration with observation of hassan et al 1987 where they also reported that withholding irrigation at crown root initiation and jointing stages affected yield the 50 irrigation at later growth stages such as jointing flowering and milking showed minimum yield penalty and this may be due to better established roots at these stages which can utilize moisture from deeper layers of soil under water scarce situations plants developing deeper root system to absorb water from deeper soil layers was previously recorded fang et al 2011and sarkar et al 2013 the exceptions to this was 75 irrigation treatment 75 ics which yielded less 5127 2 kgha 1 than 50 ics 5217 3 kgha 1 and this may be due to top yielding of this treatment in 2016 17 5099 0 kgha 1 only next to control treatment 5135 2kgha 1 better performance of 50 ics in 2016 17 may be because the crop received well distributed rainfall during the january 2017 fig 2 another reason for better yield and wue in this treatment may be because the crop canopy as well as root system at this crop growth stage is small and accordingly has less crop water demand because of less et and hence did not affect later crop establishment and ultimate yield complete withholding of irrigation was reported to affect the crop most at crown root initiation stage but we have found that keeping the soil moist with reduced irrigation 30 mm was enough for the crop to yield better the deficit irrigation 66 of et demand did not have the significant effect on heading duration maturity and yield torrion and stougaard 2017 similarly the next least affected stage with respect to yield and wue was the milking stage 50 ims and it may be due to the advancement of crop towards physiological maturity and senescence thereby leading to less water requirement for transpiration insensitivity of milking stage to reduced irrigation treatments was reported ali et al 2007a b chai et al 2015 while contrasting results where limited or no irrigation at the milking stage affected yield was reported by guttieri et al 2005 and maqbool et al 2015 at this stage the crop almost meets its water and nutrient requirements from the stored plant reserves this hypothesis is also supported by madani et al 2010 and wang et al 2011 who reported that stored reserves supported grain filling and yield at later crop growth stages the results support the view that initial crop establishment has limited water requirement and application of less irrigation at early stages may be adopted as a general practice to avoid excessive irrigation during initial crop growth stages the agbm yield of the treatments indicated that 75 irrigation produced the at par agbm with that of control except the 50 ias these observations were in agreement with earlier findings torrion and stougaard 2017 greater role of prevailing weather conditions such as high day and night temperatures on agbm accumulation than soil moisture availability has been reported acevedo et al 2002 garcía et al 2015 this clearly indicates that wheat crop in this region requires 45 mm irrigation 75 of control rather than the existing practice of 60 mm irrigation at all the crop growth stages another observation was that 50 irrigation treatments at flowering and milking stages did not affect agbm and this may be since most of the agbm accumulation happens well before the onset of flowering and milking stage torrion and stougaard 2017 harvest index studied indicated that water limitation treatments recorded better hi values than the 75 irrigation treatments and control increase in non leaf organs and photosynthetic efficiency under deficit irrigation leading to higher hi was previously studied by zhang et al 2011 further yang and zhang 2010 also reported that controlled deficit irrigation could improve hi by enhanced mobilization of stored reserves from vegetative tissues to grains control treatment did not ensure or guarantee higher grain yield this may be due to the disproportionate partitioning of assimilates which might have led to the accumulation of excess agbm and low grain yield the mean tgw values of the treatments exposed to 75 irrigation treatment 45 mm at all growth stages 75 ias were higher than the control treatment while tgw observed in 50 irrigation treatments were statistically at par to existing irrigation level treatments these findings are supported by earlier research reports xue et al 2014 while bieniek et al 2017 reported that deficit irrigation treatments had no effect on tgw when kernel number per square meter was compared between the treatments it was found that 50 its recorded lowest kernels and treatments at or immediately prior to flowering did not affect knpsm significantly this indicates that the development of floral primordia was not the factor which reduced knpsm significantly but availability of adequate water at tillering was an important factor in determining knpsm aydinsakir et al 2013 elzubeir and mohamed 2015 and greaves and wang 2017 observed that reducing amount of irrigation water beyond certain threshold had a significant effect on knpsm which is validated in this study by having recorded lower knpsm in all water limiting treatments except 25 its where kernels produced were maximum due to higher number of tpm achieved in this treatment the treatments with 50 irrigation at all crop growth stages recorded highest wue 2 66 kgm 3 due to application of 50 less water and the same has not led to proportionate yield reductions 10 8 compared to control treatment further 45 mm irrigation treatments 75 of control recorded 2 23 kgm 3 wue values which was significantly higher than control 1 88 kgm 3 these results are valid as other yield contributing traits also did not get affected in proportionate terms when irrigation water was reduced earlier research reports also suggested that wue increases as scarcity of irrigation become more severe that is water limitation lead to higher wue values chen et al 2015 peuke et al 2006 wang et al 2017 xu et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 the findings from this study also validate the earlier reported advantages of deficit irrigation predicted based on simulation models in wheat and other crops lobell and ortiz monasterio 2006 peake et al 2016 2008 stockle and james 1989 in the present study pearson s correlation analysis between water used and traits studied in the experiment revealed that tgw had a strong negative correlation r 0 959 p 0 001 whereas the hi recorded a weak negative correlation with water use the correlation between wue and water used at tillering jointing and flowering showed strong negative relation p 0 001 these results indicate that maximum wue can be attained by adopting regulated irrigation strategy tgw was found to have strong negative correlation when 75 irrigation treatment was imposed at all growth stages zhang et al 2018 and varga et al 2015 also found that hi wue and tgw were negatively correlated with wu at all growth stages saving of water by application of 75 irrigation 45 mm at all growth stages was found to be the most profitable one wherein usd 1118 was earned per hectare compared to control treatment by saving 15 mm water per irrigation the partial gross margins will be further enhanced if the value of wheat straw harvested is also considered for estimation of returns we could not consider the value of straw in this study as the price of wheat straw varies from place to place and there is no reliable source of this information water saving is also linked to saving of electricity used for operating tube wells as reported by vatta et al 2018 the water and cost savings are at experimental level and when estimated at state and country level may lead to saving of millions of usd incurred on irrigation water electricity and labour saved saving of 13 water by just adoption of tensiometers in rice on 30 of the area would save an estimated usd 459 million vatta et al 2018 5 conclusion the large scale intensive cultivation of wheat in india on around 30 mha area is one of the major factor contributing to depletion of groundwater resources this needs urgent action through technological and policy interventions to improve the water productivity and sustaining the profitability of wheat farmers this experiment was conducted during three years from 2015 2016 to 2017 2018 to test the hypothesis whether the yield levels achieved by full irrigation 60 mm can be harvested by the supply of regulated deficit irrigation 45 mm per irrigation the results revealed that 75 irrigation application at all critical growth stages produced at par grain yield above ground biomass hi thousand grains weight tillers and kernels per m2 as compared to control treatment our findings clearly show that the use of 45 mm irrigation water is beneficial than the currently practiced 60 mm irrigation water per irrigation resulting in 25 saving of water that also means a saving of about 25 in electric power use in pumping out groundwater and an additional reduction in substantial labour use if this 25 irrigation water savings is practiced on just north western plains comprising 12 mha wheat area then the resultant benefits would be quite large it would conserve a total of 9660 million m3 of water per year with an aggregate savings estimated at us 682 million 
11150,wheat is the second most important food crop in india and world one of the major difficulties faced in the wheat growing regions is the depletion of water resources at an alarming rate this study was conducted to test the hypothesis that the use of the reduced amount of irrigation water would maintain the grain yield of popular indian wheat variety hd2967 water use crop yield and water use efficiency of wheat were evaluated for three consecutive years under thirteen different irrigation treatments highest yield 5372 4 kgha 1 was recorded when crop was irrigated with full irrigation 60 mm of water at all five critical crop growth stages which were statistically at par to yields recorded under 25 deficit irrigation 45 mm at all growth stages the treatment with 50 irrigation 30 mm at all five growth stages although saved 50 water yield penalty was also significant 4788 1 kgha 1 10 9 loss treatments with normal recommended practice 60 mm have achieved lower water use efficiency wue values 1 88 kg m 3 whereas 25 deficit irrigation i e 45 mm at all five stages recorded significantly higher wue 2 23 kgm 3 in sandy loam soils the treatment where a total of 750 m3 water was saved per hectare was the most remunerative option in addition to saving of cost on water electricity and labour adoption of 45 mm irrigation at all crop growth stages can enhance both irrigation water use efficiency without any yield penalty and can be adopted as a water saving mechanism in the regions of depleting water resources keywords wheat yield water use efficiency wue deficit irrigation water use wu 1 introduction indiscriminate utilization of groundwater for irrigation has led to widespread over exploitation of groundwater resources rodell et al 2009 which is unsustainable in the long run india is the world s largest user of groundwater mukherjee et al 2015 and consumes 25 of the global share which is more than china and usa combined margat and van der gun 2013 the rates at which the ground water levels are falling is probably the fastest globally aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 during the last three decades underground water levels in north western parts of india have fallen from 8 to 16 m below ground level mbgl and in rest of india it has declined from 1 to 8 mbgl sekhri 2013 another estimate reports that north western india lost 10 9 104 giga litres of groundwater between 2002 and 2008 rodell et al 2009 additionally irrigation efficiency is less than 40 in south asia ali 2012 and in india it is 35 rosegrant 1997 this low irrigation efficiency is mainly because up to 50 water is being lost due to leakage seepage and to the system inefficiencies hamdy et al 2003 sivanappan 1994 wallace 2000 wheat is a prime staple food crop of india and has a major share in the food basket 99 7 million ton in 2017 18 being a winter season crop october to april wheat needs irrigation as 80 percent of the annual precipitation is received during the monsoon season july to september due to scanty rainfall pattern wheat depends on groundwater and hence it is mostly produced under irrigated conditions the current water productivity of wheat was estimated to be of 1 06 kg m 3 zwart et al 2010 0 8 1 0 kg m 3 meena et al 2015 in india therefore the present situation calls for identifying efficient water use measures in wheat cultivation wheat requires adequate soil moisture for normal growth and development at all growth stages which is possible through precision irrigation scheduling to reduce over irrigation meena et al 2018 excessive water application can result in waterlogging and leaching of nutrients beyond the root zone to improve water use efficiency there must be proper irrigation scheduling with just enough water as flooding may lead to the reduction in wue qiu et al 2008 and sometimes in productivity also the use of adequate water at critical growth stages is regarded as a superior practice over traditional flooding where the crop fields are filled with enormous volumes of water earlier reports suggesting benefits of using deficit irrigation to save water in maize peake et al 2008 stockle and james 1989 wheat lobell and ortiz monasterio 2006 peake et al 2016 and under dry farming system oweis and hachum 2006 are available however most of these are either predictions based on simulation models or dealt with regions other than indo gangetic plains of india little is known about the effect of the reduced amount of irrigation water on performance of wheat in high input use regions of india however there are few earlier reports on irrigation scheduling taking wue as major objective in wheat jalota et al 2006 panda et al 2003 panda et al 2003 evaluated wheat at different irrigation treatments decided based on soil water status measured using neutron probe where he reported that wheat wue was highest when irrigation was given at 45 depletion of available soil moisture in cotton wheat cropping system jalota et al 2006 reported reducing the number of irrigations to achieve maximum crop water productivity they further indicated that grain development stage as the most critical stage to be irrigated if a farmer has access to limited irrigation source therefore the objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the use of the reduced amount of irrigation water would maintain the grain yield of wheat in semi arid environments of north western plain zone of india where annual evaporation 1560 mm is nearly double the annual precipitation 744 mm further our aim was to determine the effect of reduced amount of irrigation water at critical growth stages on grain yield yield components and wue of wheat 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site experiment was conducted for three consecutive years

descriptions of treatments are presented in table 1 using the randomized block design with three replications in a 2 8 m2 plot size the experiment was planted in the month of november 23 11 2015 25 11 2016 and 28 11 2017 respectively using a tractor operated precision seed drill which in one run plants 10 rows and maintains a uniform inter row spacing of 20 cm it also distributes seeds uniformly within rows with the help of an electric distributor the standard recommended anonymous 2014a seed rate of 100 kgha 1 was followed to get a uniform plant population of 250 plants m 2 the crop attained anthesis stage between 90 102 days in all the three seasons the crop was harvested in the month of april 20 04 2016 12 04 2017 and 21 04 2018 respectively nutrients like 150 kg n 60 kg p2o5 and 30 kg

through urea along with first and second irrigations weeds disease and insect control were uniformly managed during the crop growing season all other crop management techniques followed the regional recommended practices anonymous 2014b 2 3 weather parameters the data on important weather parameters such as daily minimum and maximum temperature precipitation were recorded through the crop season during the experimental years 2015 16 2016 17 and 2017 18 the long term data of weather parameters for the period between 1981 to 2018 were obtained from the data repository maintained by icar central soil salinity research institute karnal the long term temperature minimum and maximum and precipitation data were used to calculate the long term average values 2 4 irrigation treatments the method of irrigation at each growth stage involved pumping of water from a tubewell and carried to the experimental field via gravity flow in irrigation channels running adjacent to the experimental plots the existing practice of irrigation in indo gangetic plains of india in which at least 60 mm of water is being applied by surface flooding method for 5 6 times during crop season depending on the weather and soil conditions was chosen as control treatment in this study this is as per the package of practice recommended to the farmers of the region and currently it is 60 mm per irrigation deo et al 2017 singh 2016 water application was based on the estimated crop water requirement calculated over the entire growing season irrigation treatments were precisely imposed on each plot by measuring the amount of irrigation water applied using a parshall flume discharge measurement flume a parshall flume measures the discharge of irrigation water passing through the canal of the flume first height of the water level in the flume was recorded and this height was converted to discharge with the conversion chart a three inch parshall flume was installed once at the entrance of the supply channel and the upstream inlet of experimental plots the amount of water applied using parshall flume was calculated using the following equation 1 q 0 00138h2 h where q is the discharge in litres per second and h is the height of water level in cm this discharge was allowed to flow into one plot at a time with the aid of a calculator and a stopwatch the flow into each plot and the time required to apply the desired depth of water was immediately calculated as soon as the water was guided into the plot immediately after the desired depth is applied to a given plot the discharge was cut off by closing the channel banks to stop water from entering the plots the irrigation was applied from early december to early april in the dry season each critical growth stage of crop was exposed to stress by applying deficit irrigation irrigation treatments were established based on the different growth stages of wheat viz crown root initiation cri maximum tillering jointing flowering and milk stage there were 13 irrigation treatments including full irrigation i e 60 mm at all stages as the control the treatments and irrigation levels have been listed in table 1 2 5 data recording to avoid border effects side rows and 0 5 m from each end of the plot was harvested the remaining net plot of 11 2 m2 1 6 m 7 m was harvested for recording above ground biomass agbm and yield the crop was hand harvested by cutting at ground level when grains matured and the straw had turned yellow data on biological yield were recorded after sun drying of the harvested crop the sun dried bundles were threshed and winnowed and the grains so obtained were weighed and yield for different treatments was adjusted at 14 moisture for appropriate comparison harvest index hi was calculated as the ratio of the grain weight to the total agbm grain samples were randomly collected for thousand grains weight tgw and counted by using contador seed counter and weighed to record tgw tillers per square meter tpm were counted at physiological maturity from each plot plant height was measured by picking the plants randomly and carefully from middle three rows by avoiding one meter length from either of the corners of the middle rows water productivity water use efficiency is the physical accounting of water with yield or economic output so as to assess how much value is being obtained from the use of per unit water for this analysis water use efficiency was calculated as 2 water use efficiency wue output q where wue is the productivity of water in kgm 3 output is the productivity of wheat in kgha 1 and q is the amount of water used by the crop in m3 ha 1 partial gross margin for comparing the returns from each treatments was carried out using the following equation from stark et al 2000 3 pgm y p w where pgm partial gross margin y yield of wheat per hectare p average price of wheat w cost of irrigation water in haryana 2 6 data analysis the general linear model glm procedure in sas 9 3 version 6 1 7061 for windows cary nc sas institute inc 2012 was used to perform statistical analysis means for main and interaction effects were separated using tukey s studentized range test at 0 05 0 01 and 0 001 levels of significance correlation analysis was performed on selected growth variables against water used to determine the degree of relationship and their contribution to variation in yields in deficit irrigation levels pearson s correlation coefficient r was used to indicate the interaction of grain yield yield parameters and wue with water use 3 results 3 1 climatic conditions the amount and temporal distribution of rainfall through the wheat growing season play a very important role in wheat cultivation the rainfall data of the experimental years during the wheat growing season was compared with the long term average rainfall values the long term rainfall data revealed that every year at karnal location receives on an average about 120 mm of precipitation during the wheat growing season fig 2 among all the three experimental years 2016 17 wheat season received the maximum rainfall of 97 mm and when compared to lta this was shortfall by 23 mm the next highest amount of precipitation received was during the third year of experiment i e 2017 18 85 mm which was only 71 of lta the least precipitation among the three years was received during 2015 16 55 7 mm which was short of 64 mm to lta rainfall recorded at karnal the distribution of rainfall through the wheat growing season was found to be scanty by the occurrence of spells of heavy rainfall in a short span of time followed by dry weather for a long period for example during the 2015 2016 growing season the total rainfall of 56 mm was received only in two spells and that too 46 mm of it was received during march march lta 5 mm while in 2016 17 season 86 mm of total 97 mm precipitation 88 was received in a single month of january which was 56 mm more than lta rainfall of january 28 mm the experimental years were comparable to lta in terms of the minimum and maximum temperatures and it can be observed that the minimum and maximum temperatures have increased by 1 2 c during february to april months when compared to lta fig 1 3 2 grain yield agbm harvest index tgw and tpm 3 2 1 grain yield the grain yield agbm and harvest index values of the treatments during the experimental years 2015 2018 have been summarized in table 2 data obtained from the 3 year study showed that grain yield was significantly p 0 01 affected by soil water deficits highest mean grain yield 5448 0 kgha 1 was obtained during 2015 16 a 10 5 decrease was observed in the grain yield of 2016 17 4878 9 kgha 1 and in 2017 18 mean grain yield across irrigation treatments 5191 7 kgha 1 was reduced by 4 6 the highest grain yield was obtained from the control treatment followed by 75 its 75 ims and 50 ics treatments although the differences among them were at par the differences in yield were at par in treatments involving 25 reduced irrigation or in 75 ias treatment the yield penalty was significant under treatment 50 ias when control treatment was imposed at all five crop growth stages the pooled mean yield over the three years was maximum 5372 4 kgha 1 compared to all other treatments in the treatment 75 ias the grain yield recorded was 5196 3 kgha 1 which was 96 7 of control and statistically at par with the yields obtained in the control treatment in comparison to the control in the 50 ias treatment mean grain yield over three years of experiment indicated a statistically significant decrease by 10 9 4788 1 kgha 1 when irrigation treatments 2 5 in table 2 were compared 75 its was least affected by attaining minimum yield penalty 60 kg ha 1 1 1 however the differences in mean yields among these treatments were insignificant table 2 4 6 240 kg ha 1 yield reduction was observed under 75 ics which was maximum reduction among the 75 irrigation treatments in contrast 50 ics resulted in opposite results compared to 75 ics here the treatment 50 ics yielded 5217 3 kg ha 1and had least yield penalty 2 9 compared to the control treatment 3 2 2 above ground biomass agbm the experimental mean agbm yield across the three years 2015 2018 was compared highest mean agbm yield 12 33 t ha 1 was obtained during 2017 2018 followed by 2015 2016 12 13 t ha 1 whereas during the 2016 2017 a considerable decrease by 9 2 over the other two years table 2 was recorded 11 01 t ha 1 the mean agbm yield over the three years was significantly affected when 50 irrigation was applied at all growth stages 50 ias 10 69 t ha 1 in comparison to control 12 48 t ha 1 mean agbm yield over three years of control treatment was maximum 12 44 t ha 1 as compared to all other twelve treatments although the differences were statistically insignificant except in case of 50 ias treatment the agbm yield of 75 ias pooled over the three years was 11 77 t ha 1 this was 94 3 of agbm obtained in control treatment and the differences between them were insignificant the agbm pooled over the three years under 50 ias treatment a significant decrease of 14 3 10 69 t ha 1 than control treatment 12 44 t ha 1 was observed stage specific treatments 2 5 in table 2 revealed that tillering stage 75 its was least affected in terms of minimum agbm reduction 0 29 t ha 1 2 3 however the differences in mean agbm among the treatments were insignificant table 2 the deficit irrigation at jointing stage 75 ijs accumulated least agbm 11 32 t ha 1 and the reduction was 9 3 when compared to control treatment among the 50 irrigation treatments 7 11 in table 2 none produced significantly differing agbm in this case the treatment at the milking stage 50 ims was the least affected stage producing 12 09 tha 1 agbm which was 3 1 less than control treatment while treatment at jointing 50 ijs was the most affected stage which accumulated 6 1 less agbm 11 72 tha 1 than control treatment 3 2 3 harvest index the mean harvest index hi value of the present study pooled over the three years was 0 44 while it ranged between 0 42 and 0 45 the hi values of the treatments exposed to 50 and 75 irrigation were higher than the hi values of control treatment the trend increased with decreasing quantity of irrigation water hi values of treatment with 75 irrigation at jointing stage 75 ijs were significantly higher 0 46 than control treatment 0 43 3 2 4 thousand grains weight tgw the mean tgw value in the present study pooled over the three years was 35 6 g while the range varied between 33 9 g and 37 0 g the highest tgw was produced under treatment 50 its 37 0 g followed by 75 ims 36 7 g and 75 ias 36 4 g even though the differences among the treatments were insignificant the 75 ias treatment produced 36 4 g tgw which was higher than the control treatment 35 8 g 3 2 5 tillers per square meter tpm the mean tpm values pooled over the three years was 491 while the range varied between 454 and 531 the pooled tpm data over the three years indicated that the highest tpm was produced under control treatment 531 followed by 75 ims 516 and 50 ics 506 tpm was reduced considerably in treatments where 50 irrigation was imposed at maximum tillering stage 50 its 454 and 50 ias 464 the tpm values did not reduce significantly when irrigation reduced by 15 mm at all growth stages separately or collectively other than maximum tillering the 50 irrigation 30 mm at the maximum tillering stage and at all growth stages reduced tillering significantly 3 2 6 kernel number per square meter knpsm the mean knpsm values over three years experiment was 14680 while the range varied between 14 005 and 15 314 treatment 75 its produced highest knpsm and control treatment followed the order by recording 15 197 kernels 50 its recorded minimum knpsm which was significantly lower compared to the control treatment and also the 75 its 3 3 water use efficiency water use efficiency values estimated for the irrigation treatments have been presented in table 3 the data revealed that the pooled mean wue values of the experimental treatments over the three years vary in the range of 1 84 2 66 kgm 3 and clearly the reduced irrigation treatments have shown the increase in wue values and in contrast the control treatment has achieved lower wue values the highest wue values were observed in 50 ias 2 66 kgm 3 followed by 75 ias treatment 2 23 kgm 3 and among the stage specific treatments 75 ims had recorded maximum wue 1 93 kgm 3 while 50 ics recorded maximum wue 2 04 kgm 3 followed by 50 ims treatment 2 01 kgm 3 the results also revealed that 75 ifs and 50 ifs treatments recorded the minimum wue values 3 4 correlation analysis pearson s correlation was computed for understanding the association between yield and other traits and amount of water used wu at different growth stages table 4 across years and treatments analysis showed that the decrease in wu was found to have a strong negative influence on tgw i e higher grain weight was associated with lower wu a meager negative correlation was detected between the hi and wu while the correlation of plant height ph was positive but with a minimum significance level computation of treatment wise correlation of traits studied with wu resulted in a reasonable negative correlation between yield and 50 irrigation wu at tillering and flowering which means a minimum yield penalty was observed under 50 its and 50 ifs treatments irrigation treatments had a substantial negative effect on tgw as it can be observed under 75 ias treatment where tgw was found to have increased significantly p 0 001 among the stage specific 75 irrigation treatments 75 ijs and other treatments had a moderate negative effect on tgw p 0 006 except 50 ifs which had a low negative correlation another trait which was most influenced by reduced irrigation treatments was tpm a strong negative correlation p 0 001 was found between tpm and wu in treatment 50 its followed by 75 ics p 0 009 the 50 irrigation treatments at tillering jointing and flowering had witnessed an increased wue with a strong negative correlation 3 5 partial gross margins by saving irrigation water the partial gross margins from each of the treatment was compared taking into account the cost irrigation water in haryana india as reported by cornish et al 2004 and wichelns 2010 the cost of irrigation water per 1000 m3 ranged from usd 3 in mexico to usd 38 in china and it was usd 71 in haryana the partial gross margins earned in different treatments have been presented in table 5 the estimation shows that the 75 ias treatment was the most viable strategy to save maximum water with minimum effect on yield further the 75 ias treatment was found to be the most profitable by producing a partial gross margin of usd 1118 ha 1 while the control treatment produced usd1108 ha 1 4 discussion availability of electricity for irrigation purpose is highly subsidized tariff free provision of government policies for agriculture in india and other south asian countries which has led to the excess use of water leading to over exploitation of underground water resources therefore the existing practice of irrigating 60 mm of water per irrigation deo et al 2017 singh 2016 was perceived to be excess and is used as control treatment in this study further the aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that whether reducing the amount of irrigation water judiciously by regulated deficit irrigation at critical growth stages of wheat will enhance the water use efficiency in addition to not much effect on yield the strategy would also add to reducing the cost of cultivation incurred on water electricity and labour used for irrigating wheat the labor and electricity costs involved in irrigating crop are a significant component of cost of cultivation there are few earlier studies in india jalota et al 2006 panda et al 2003 that dealt on measuring water productivity under reduced irrigation conditions in wheat the soil water depletion measured through neutron probe by panda et al 2003 where they reported that wheat wue was highest at 45 depletion of available soil moisture while jalota et al 2006 used a simulation model to predict crop water productivity by reducing the number of irrigations in cotton wheat cropping system they further indicated that grain development stage as the most critical stage in wheat in this study the main purpose of deficit irrigation was to apply water just to meet the appropriate crop water demand rather than applying excess water as a luxury the grain yield of the experiment ranged from 4788 to 5314 kg ha 1 and was comparable to the earlier predicted reports from the study region arora et al 2007 timsina et al 2008 the mean experimental grain yield data varied between the three years and the second year 2016 17 mean yield 4878 9 kg ha 1 was lowest compared to the other two years the reason for this reduction may be attributed to the fact that a spell of heavy rainfall of 58 8 mm was received during the fourth julian week january 2017 leading to the waterlogged condition as well as lodging to some extent 30 during grain filling period due to high wind speed at the time of irrigation which might have hampered attainment of full yield potential of the cultivar several other studies also observed that irregular rainfall patterns affected yield due to waterlogging marti et al 2015 peake et al 2014 torrion and stougaard 2017 tripathi et al 2005 over the years 2015 2018 analysis showed that yields obtained in different treatments were insignificant except the treatment 50 ias which witnessed 11 yield reduction compared to control treatment the general trend of yield reduction was as expected i e early crop growth stages had small soil moisture requirement for crop establishment and treatments with 75 irrigation of 45 mm water was enough for crop growth further 50 irrigation treatments 30 mm at early growth stages affected crop yield this finding is in corroboration with observation of hassan et al 1987 where they also reported that withholding irrigation at crown root initiation and jointing stages affected yield the 50 irrigation at later growth stages such as jointing flowering and milking showed minimum yield penalty and this may be due to better established roots at these stages which can utilize moisture from deeper layers of soil under water scarce situations plants developing deeper root system to absorb water from deeper soil layers was previously recorded fang et al 2011and sarkar et al 2013 the exceptions to this was 75 irrigation treatment 75 ics which yielded less 5127 2 kgha 1 than 50 ics 5217 3 kgha 1 and this may be due to top yielding of this treatment in 2016 17 5099 0 kgha 1 only next to control treatment 5135 2kgha 1 better performance of 50 ics in 2016 17 may be because the crop received well distributed rainfall during the january 2017 fig 2 another reason for better yield and wue in this treatment may be because the crop canopy as well as root system at this crop growth stage is small and accordingly has less crop water demand because of less et and hence did not affect later crop establishment and ultimate yield complete withholding of irrigation was reported to affect the crop most at crown root initiation stage but we have found that keeping the soil moist with reduced irrigation 30 mm was enough for the crop to yield better the deficit irrigation 66 of et demand did not have the significant effect on heading duration maturity and yield torrion and stougaard 2017 similarly the next least affected stage with respect to yield and wue was the milking stage 50 ims and it may be due to the advancement of crop towards physiological maturity and senescence thereby leading to less water requirement for transpiration insensitivity of milking stage to reduced irrigation treatments was reported ali et al 2007a b chai et al 2015 while contrasting results where limited or no irrigation at the milking stage affected yield was reported by guttieri et al 2005 and maqbool et al 2015 at this stage the crop almost meets its water and nutrient requirements from the stored plant reserves this hypothesis is also supported by madani et al 2010 and wang et al 2011 who reported that stored reserves supported grain filling and yield at later crop growth stages the results support the view that initial crop establishment has limited water requirement and application of less irrigation at early stages may be adopted as a general practice to avoid excessive irrigation during initial crop growth stages the agbm yield of the treatments indicated that 75 irrigation produced the at par agbm with that of control except the 50 ias these observations were in agreement with earlier findings torrion and stougaard 2017 greater role of prevailing weather conditions such as high day and night temperatures on agbm accumulation than soil moisture availability has been reported acevedo et al 2002 garcía et al 2015 this clearly indicates that wheat crop in this region requires 45 mm irrigation 75 of control rather than the existing practice of 60 mm irrigation at all the crop growth stages another observation was that 50 irrigation treatments at flowering and milking stages did not affect agbm and this may be since most of the agbm accumulation happens well before the onset of flowering and milking stage torrion and stougaard 2017 harvest index studied indicated that water limitation treatments recorded better hi values than the 75 irrigation treatments and control increase in non leaf organs and photosynthetic efficiency under deficit irrigation leading to higher hi was previously studied by zhang et al 2011 further yang and zhang 2010 also reported that controlled deficit irrigation could improve hi by enhanced mobilization of stored reserves from vegetative tissues to grains control treatment did not ensure or guarantee higher grain yield this may be due to the disproportionate partitioning of assimilates which might have led to the accumulation of excess agbm and low grain yield the mean tgw values of the treatments exposed to 75 irrigation treatment 45 mm at all growth stages 75 ias were higher than the control treatment while tgw observed in 50 irrigation treatments were statistically at par to existing irrigation level treatments these findings are supported by earlier research reports xue et al 2014 while bieniek et al 2017 reported that deficit irrigation treatments had no effect on tgw when kernel number per square meter was compared between the treatments it was found that 50 its recorded lowest kernels and treatments at or immediately prior to flowering did not affect knpsm significantly this indicates that the development of floral primordia was not the factor which reduced knpsm significantly but availability of adequate water at tillering was an important factor in determining knpsm aydinsakir et al 2013 elzubeir and mohamed 2015 and greaves and wang 2017 observed that reducing amount of irrigation water beyond certain threshold had a significant effect on knpsm which is validated in this study by having recorded lower knpsm in all water limiting treatments except 25 its where kernels produced were maximum due to higher number of tpm achieved in this treatment the treatments with 50 irrigation at all crop growth stages recorded highest wue 2 66 kgm 3 due to application of 50 less water and the same has not led to proportionate yield reductions 10 8 compared to control treatment further 45 mm irrigation treatments 75 of control recorded 2 23 kgm 3 wue values which was significantly higher than control 1 88 kgm 3 these results are valid as other yield contributing traits also did not get affected in proportionate terms when irrigation water was reduced earlier research reports also suggested that wue increases as scarcity of irrigation become more severe that is water limitation lead to higher wue values chen et al 2015 peuke et al 2006 wang et al 2017 xu et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 the findings from this study also validate the earlier reported advantages of deficit irrigation predicted based on simulation models in wheat and other crops lobell and ortiz monasterio 2006 peake et al 2016 2008 stockle and james 1989 in the present study pearson s correlation analysis between water used and traits studied in the experiment revealed that tgw had a strong negative correlation r 0 959 p 0 001 whereas the hi recorded a weak negative correlation with water use the correlation between wue and water used at tillering jointing and flowering showed strong negative relation p 0 001 these results indicate that maximum wue can be attained by adopting regulated irrigation strategy tgw was found to have strong negative correlation when 75 irrigation treatment was imposed at all growth stages zhang et al 2018 and varga et al 2015 also found that hi wue and tgw were negatively correlated with wu at all growth stages saving of water by application of 75 irrigation 45 mm at all growth stages was found to be the most profitable one wherein usd 1118 was earned per hectare compared to control treatment by saving 15 mm water per irrigation the partial gross margins will be further enhanced if the value of wheat straw harvested is also considered for estimation of returns we could not consider the value of straw in this study as the price of wheat straw varies from place to place and there is no reliable source of this information water saving is also linked to saving of electricity used for operating tube wells as reported by vatta et al 2018 the water and cost savings are at experimental level and when estimated at state and country level may lead to saving of millions of usd incurred on irrigation water electricity and labour saved saving of 13 water by just adoption of tensiometers in rice on 30 of the area would save an estimated usd 459 million vatta et al 2018 5 conclusion the large scale intensive cultivation of wheat in india on around 30 mha area is one of the major factor contributing to depletion of groundwater resources this needs urgent action through technological and policy interventions to improve the water productivity and sustaining the profitability of wheat farmers this experiment was conducted during three years from 2015 2016 to 2017 2018 to test the hypothesis whether the yield levels achieved by full irrigation 60 mm can be harvested by the supply of regulated deficit irrigation 45 mm per irrigation the results revealed that 75 irrigation application at all critical growth stages produced at par grain yield above ground biomass hi thousand grains weight tillers and kernels per m2 as compared to control treatment our findings clearly show that the use of 45 mm irrigation water is beneficial than the currently practiced 60 mm irrigation water per irrigation resulting in 25 saving of water that also means a saving of about 25 in electric power use in pumping out groundwater and an additional reduction in substantial labour use if this 25 irrigation water savings is practiced on just north western plains comprising 12 mha wheat area then the resultant benefits would be quite large it would conserve a total of 9660 million m3 of water per year with an aggregate savings estimated at us 682 million

of first flush summertime flowers in the ever flowering meiwa kumquat fortunella crassifolia swingle in this study we examined how swd affects transpiration and the accumulation of soluble sugars in various parts of the plant as a result of osmoregulation despite the rapid decrease in the transpiration of the leaves that of the stem remained unchanged during swd treatment at one eighth of that from the leaves under non stressed conditions the swd treatment increased the total soluble sugar content in all plant parts except the leaves increase in the monosaccharides such as glucose and fructose being greater than for the disaccharide sucrose in the stems of shoots more than 3 years of age as well as in the xylem of scaffold branches is suggesting that these increased sugar levels were due to osmoregulation the sucrose content decreased markedly during the 4 months after swd treatment in the xylem of scaffold branches but was significantly higher in the fruit that were harvested from swd treated trees at 4 months after swd treatment these results suggest that the sugars that are accumulated in the xylem positively affect fruit growth after swd treatment keywords water stress osmoregulation sugar accumulation stem transpiration 1 introduction plants experiencing drought actively accumulate soluble sugars and free amino acids to prevent cell dehydration via a process known as osmoregulation meyer and boyer 1981 in many crops such as citrus deficit irrigation may increase fruit sugar content without decreasing yield garcía tejero et al 2010 gonzález altozano and castel 1999 panigrahi and srivastava 2016 pérez pérez et al 2008 in japan high sugar content fruits are produced on citrus trees such as satsuma mandarin citrus unshiu by controlling the soil water content with the application of this theory yakushiji et al 1996 yakushiji et al 1998 also reported that the translocation rate of 13c labeled photosynthates into the fruit increased under a moderate swd treatment however although it is generally thought that the sugars that are accumulated in the leaves under water stress are translocated into the fruits resulting in an increased sugar

that of non treated controls despite the translocation rate of photosynthates being depressed he also found that the polysaccharides of the flesh cell walls were hydrolyzed under the water stress

the closely related genus citrus abbott 1935 meiwa kumquat fortunella crassifolia swingle a representative species of the genus fortunella that grown in japan is an ever flowering species where it blooms in spring april summer june to august and autumn september spring flowers bloom on the shoots that elongated in the previous year but are generally few in number and not used to fruit production by contrast summertime flowers which are used to fruit production emerge on the current spring shoots that elongate in may at a rate of 1 3 flowers per axil hadano 2000 iwahori and tominaga 1986 therefore the flower bud differentiation period for summertime flowers is thought to be around 1 month from the termination of spring shoot elongation through to flowering abbott 1935 summertime flowers that fail to produce fruitlets are followed by new flowers on the same axil approximately 2 weeks later resulting in the production of first second and third flush flowers hadano 2000 iwasaki et al 2000 iwasaki et al 2017 first flush flowers in summertime flowers exhibit high annual variability in their quantity with only a few flowers generally being produced but give rise to fruit that exhibit the fastest growth and have the highest quality as mentioned above swd treatment applied during the flower bud differentiation period increases the number of first flush flowers in summertime flowers emerging on the current spring shoots however it remains unclear why swd treatment before summertime flowering affects not only the number of first flush flowers but also fruit weight fruit quality and yield per tree at harvest which is more than 6 months after the treatment iwasaki and hiratsuka 2019 reported that lesser water was available for foliar transpiration in trees with larger trunk and old branches under drought conditions because there was a significant negative correlation between the dry weight of the trunk including old branches and the leaf water potential in meiwa kumquat trees and they suggested that transpiration from the surface of trunk and old branches continued even under drought conditions as one of the reasons the trunk of woody species is thought to function as water reservoirs that supply water for foliar transpiration under drought conditions chapotin et al 2006 van den bilcke et al 2013a 2013b however the water stored in the trunk and old branches seems not to be used to maintain the leaf water transpiration under drought conditions in meiwa kumquat trees although the possible mechanisms related to the movement of water between the trunk and the leaves are not clear the trunk and old branches may play an important role in maintaining the water relations of the whole tree thus we believe it is important to elucidate the physiological responses to drought of not only the leaves but also the trunk including the scaffold branches to assess the severity of water stress of the whole tree in the present study we investigated the accumulation of soluble sugars in plant parts due to the osmoregulation in meiwa kumquat by applying an swd treatment intended to increase first flush summertime flowers in order to elucidate the water relation of the whole tree and the role of the trunk and the scaffold branch under drought conditions was discussed in relation to the sugar accumulation in each plant part 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant materials and treatments eighteen year old meiwa kumquat fortunella crassifolia swingle trees grafted onto trifoliate orange poncirus trifiliata l raf were used for experiment in 2017 they have been planted in 2001 and since then they have grown 29 l non woven fabric pots containing commercially available humus rich soil mixed soil of coconut shell fibers bark compost loamy soil and vermiculite and have received commonly recommended cultural practices for citrus including fertilizer application plant protection pruning and some transplanting the growth of the rootstock was superior to that of the scion resulting in the typical phenomenon of rootstock overgrowth the tree heights and canopy diameters were approx 1 2 m and 1 5 m respectively during the experimental year 2017 sprouting and elongation of the spring shoots began on around may 1 and were completed by around may 23 the swd treated and non treated control cont groups were established on june 9 in a greenhouse at meiji university kawasaki kanagawa japan 35 61 n 139 55 e with five trees per group in the swd treated trees the soil water content was reduced by withholding water and the treatment ended on june 20 a small amount of water approx 300 ml was supplied when the soil water content fell to 15 v v the trees of cont and after swd treated were supplied with adequate water so that the soil water content was maintained around 30 during the treatment the soil water content in all pots was monitored at approx 10 cm depth between the trunk and the pot rim using an ech2o ec 5 soil moisture sensor meter group inc pullman wa usa data were collected every 10 min and stored in em50 and em5b digital data loggers meter group inc pullman wa usa 2 2 leaf and stem transpiration rates leaf and stem transpiration rates were determined at 9 00 h local time on june 9 12 15 17 and 20 2017 in three trees from each treatment group that showed similar level of leaf wilting leaf fold and rolling transpiration rates were determined using water stress indicator sheet wsis life care giken inc toyama japan which gives an index of the transpiration rate the principle of this method is that cobalt ii chloride changes from blue via intermediate colors to pink depending on the amount of water absorbed hoshi et al 2007 morinaga et al 2016 the wsis has a 3 5 cm2 testing area with a small filter paper approx 0 6 cm2 impregnated with cobalt ii chloride which changes color completely after absorbing 0 55 mg water fig 1 a b the perimeter of the testing area is sticky and adheres to the surface of the leaves or stems whereas the other side is covered with an impermeable material and is not affected by ambient humidity the wsis was affixed to the abaxial leaf surface to determine the level of leaf transpiration fig 1c and to the surface of the trunk or one of the scaffold branches that formed the lenticels on the bark to determine stem transpiration fig 1d the time taken for complete color change tcc was calculated in minutes and was used as an index of the transpiration rate 2 3 leaf and xylem water potential the leaf water potential was measured using a psychrometer wp4 t meter group inc pullman wa usa in an incubator maintained at 25 c two leaves per tree from each of the three trees per treatment group were collected as one sample at 9 00 h on june 12 15 17 and 20 the last day of the swd treatment at the time of leaf sampling the adaxial surface was rubbed with wet sandpaper 1000 to remove the cuticular layer the leaves were then sealed in a small plastic bag and which was enclosed in an aluminum vapor deposition film bag and placed in an incubator maintained at 25 c until measurement the stem xylem water potential was measured in one tree per treatment group by removing some of the bark from the trunk or one of the scaffold branches with a knife and attaching a stem psychrometer psy1 ict international armidale nsw aus chamber to the flattened xylem surface dixon and tyree 1984 nizinski et al 2013 data were collected every 30 min and stored in built in logger 2 4 flowering behavior ten current spring shoots that were approx 10 cm long were selected from each of the five trees in each treatment group to observe the flowering behavior the number of flowers that bloomed per day was recorded from june 21 to july 31 2017 the number of first flush flowers defined as those that bloomed from june 21 to july 10 and the total number of flowers per 100 nodes were then estimated for each tree 2 5 soluble sugar contents and fruit quality one scaffold branch was harvested from each of the three trees per treatment groups on july 20 2017 at the end of the swd treatment and on november 2 2017 when the fruit had just started to change color the plant parts were categorized as follows leaves or stems of the current spring shoots leaves or stems over 1 year old and branches over 3 year old including scaffold branches the fresh weight of each plant part was measured and were then stored at 70 c samples were freeze dried and ground to powder for analysis of the soluble sugar contents soluble sugars were extracted from 1 g of each sample with 50 ml of 80 ethanol for 24 h at 15 c the ethanol was then removed using a rotary evaporator n 1000 tokyo rika kikai co tokyo japan at 35 c following which the remaining aqueous phase was lyophilized and the residue was dissolved in 2 ml of ultrapure water to prepare an analytical sample the samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter 13hp045 an advantec group tokyo japan before being injected into a high performance liquid chromatography hplc system lc 2000plus series jasco tokyo japan equipped with a shodex sc1011 column showa denko k k tokyo that was maintained at 80 c ultrapure water was used as the mobile phase and the flow rate was 1 0 ml min 1 sucrose glucose and fructose were identified and quantified by comparison with peaks of known standards using a refractive index detector ri 2031 jasco tokyo japan five fruits of average size and rind color were selected from each of the scaffold branches harvested on november 2 2017 the fresh weights longitudinal and transverse diameters of the fruits were determined following which the fruits were stored at 70 until sugar extraction a 5 g sample of each fruit was homogenized with 50 ml of 85 ethanol and the homogenate was placed in an incubator at 15 c for 24 h the homogenate was then filtered through qualitative filter paper no 2 advantec group tokyo japan following which the ethanol was removed as described above the remaining aqueous phase was adjusted to a volume of 50 ml and the sugar contents were analyzed by hplc as described above 2 6 statistical analyses all data were analyzed using software kaleidagraph v 4 5 synergy software reading pa usa difference in the means between treatments was assessed by t tests mean separations in sugar content among the plant parts or in water potential and transpiration rate among the dates were done by tukey s honestly significant difference test when anova was significant at p 0 05 or p 0 01 correlation between leaf and stem water potential was analyzed by linear regression 3 results 3 1 changes in leaf water potential and transpiration rate of the leaf and stem during swd treatment the mean soil water contents gradually decreased to approximately 10 by june 20 as a result of the swd treatment but were maintained at 30 33 in the untreated soils data not shown the average mid morning leaf water potentials of the swd treated trees decreased from 2 3 mpa on june 12 to 4 3 mpa on june 17 and then increased to 3 4 mpa on june 20 following the application of a small amount of water on june 17 fig 2 by contrast the average mid morning leaf water potentials fluctuated around 2 0 mpa in the cont trees during the treatment period with a significant difference being detected between cont and swd treated trees on june 17 and june 20 which was the last day of swd treatment at mid morning 9 00 h the average water potentials in xylem and leaf was 1 64 mpa and 1 93 mpa respectively in cont trees on the other hand in swd treated trees the average xylem water potential was 4 31 mpa which was somewhat lower than that of the leaves 3 38 mpa and there was a significant positive correlation between the two water potentials fig 3 on june 9 the day of commencement of the swd treatment the tcc was 6 5 min for the leaves of cont trees and this remained unchanged during the treatment period table 1 by contrast the tcc was 77 min for the leaves of swd treated trees on june 12 and 100 min after june 15 at which time there was a significant difference between the tcc of cont and swd treated trees p 0 001 however the tcc of the stem did not change during the swd treatment period and exhibited no significant difference between the swd treated and cont trees even on june 20 table 1 the tcc of the stem was approx 50 min indicating that the stem transpiration rate is approximately one eighth that of the leaves 3 2 flowering behavior and sugar contents of the plant parts following swd treatment by the end of july two peaks of flowering had been observed in cont trees on july 4 and 16 whereas only one peak had been observed in swd treated trees on july 5 fig 4 a the maximum numbers of flowers bloomed per 100 nodes in a day were 28 on july 16 in cont trees and 46 on july 5 in swd treated trees while the numbers of first flush flowers were 25 per 100 nodes for cont trees and 109 per 100 nodes for swd treated trees fig 4b which represented a significant increase in swd treated trees the total number of flowers also increased slightly in swd treated trees but was not significantly different from that of cont trees the sugar contents of the various plant parts that were harvested on june 20 are shown in fig 5 a sucrose glucose and fructose were detected in all of the plant parts although there were also 2 3 unknown peaks in hplc chromatogram the total sugar content was significantly increased by the swd treatment in all plant parts except the leaves table 2 furthermore the increased rate of the total sugar content i e the proportion of sugar contents in each swd treated tree to the mean of those in cont trees tended to be higher in the xylem than in the bark or in the leaves in the cont trees sucrose was the predominant sugar in all organs except the stems and leaves of the current spring shoots fig 5a in which there were no significant differences among the three types of sugars in the stems and glucose had the highest content in the leaves in the swd treated trees the glucose and fructose contents appeared to increase in the stems of the previous year s and current spring shoots but there was no marked increase in any of the three sugars in the leaves with the exception of glucose in the previous year s leaves all three sugars increased in the xylem of the scaffold branches of swd treated trees however particularly the monosaccharides such as glucose and fructose with the increased rate being significantly higher for glucose and fructose than for sucrose 12 4 6 0 and 1 5 respectively table 3 although a large amount of sucrose was detected in the bark of the scaffold branches only small amounts of glucose and fructose were observed the amount of sucrose in the bark was significantly higher in swd treated trees whereas there was little or no difference in the monosaccharides fig 5a the increased rate of the monosaccharides were also significantly different from that of sucrose in the stems of the previous year s and current spring shoots table 3 there were no significant differences in the sugar contents between treatments in any of the plant parts that were harvested on november 2 fig 5b there was no change in the contents of monosaccharides in the xylem of the scaffold branches in swd treated trees from june 20 to nov 2 whereas these significantly increased in cont trees fig 6 a nevertheless the sucrose decreased significantly in swd treated trees but did not change in cont trees in the stem of the current spring shoots the content of three sugars did not change from june 20 to nov 2 in cont whereas only monosaccharides contents that increased significantly by swd treatment significantly decreased during this period in swd treated trees fig 6b the sucrose contents in the leaves of the current spring shoots significantly increased in both cont trees and swd treated trees whereas monosaccharides contents significantly decreased between june 20 and nov 2 fig 6c the fruit weights and diameters of the fruit harvested on november 2 were significantly higher in swd treated trees than in cont trees fig 7 a the total sugar content was also higher in the fruit from swd treated trees than in that from cont trees fig 7b in terms of the individual sugars sucrose glucose and fructose were detected in all fruit with sucrose being predominant but only the sucrose content was significantly higher in the fruit of swd treated trees than cont trees 4 discussion in this study the swd treatment significantly reduced the mid morning leaf water potential to below 4 0 mpa and significantly increased the number of first flush summertime flowers indicating that the trees to which the swd treatment was applied were exposed to severe water stress conditions in our previous study the number of first flush summertime flowers increased by the swd treatment which decrease the mid morning leaf water potential to 3 0 mpa unpublished data as the sunny day continued during this swd treatment the mid morning leaf water potential decreased rapidly and was much lower than adequate value however there were no serious damages on the trees besides a few defoliation the terms first flush flower and second flush flower were first used by iwahori and tominaga 1986 in an article presenting the effects of paclobutrazol on the number of first flush flowers in meiwa kumquat these authors examined the difference in the shoots on which first and second flush flowers emerged and concluded that it was very difficult to judge which type of flower a given shoot would bear since then it has been shown that the first second and third flush of flowers of meiwa kumquat are all summertime flowers that are borne on spring shoots that elongate in may in japan iwasaki et al 2000 iwasaki and yamaguchi 2004 and so represent continuous flowering on the same axils of the same spring shoots in the present study the swd treatment increased the number of first flush summertime flowers but did not affect the total number of summertime flowers that emerged on the spring shoots supporting the findings of iwasaki et al 2017 therefore it is considered that swd treatment accelerates the development of differentiated flower buds rather than it increases the number of flower buds that differentiate iwasaki et al 2000 ono et al 2010 there was a rapid decrease in transpiration from the leaves in swd treated trees with little transpiration being detectable by day 6 of the treatment june 15 whereas there was no significant change in the leaf transpiration rate in cont trees over the same period however the transpiration of the stem expressed as tcc which varied from 40 to 66 min did not change during the treatment period for either group the transpiration rate of the stem under non stressed conditions was approximately one eighth that of the leaves the bark of the trunk and the old branches 3 year old was lignified and has formed lenticels that conduct gas exchange and release water into the atmosphere lendzian 2006 although there is seasonal variation in lenticular transpiration the lenticels cannot regulate the transpiration rate lendzian 2006 because they do not close the transpiration of the leaves decrease rapidly under swd but that of the stem remained stable therefore it is considered that the release of water from the tree under drought conditions depends on the stem rather than the leaves thus implying that regulation of transpiration from the stem would allow plants to use less water more efficiently for tree growth and fruit production these findings may help to establish new techniques for saving irrigation water by reducing tree water consumption which is an important issue in many citrus production areas around the world carr 2012 gasquea et al 2016 panigrahi and srivastava 2016 on the other hand the sugar content of the fruit tended to increase under drought conditions which is known to improve the quality of many citrus fruits kadoya 1973 panigrahi and srivastava 2016 yakushiji et al 1996 1998 therefore it may be possible to increase the sugar content of the fruits by release excess moisture from the tree through the lenticels which is never close even during the night as unlike the stomatal pores we found that swd treated kumquat trees accumulated sugars in their scaffold branch particularly in the xylem as well as in the other plant parts although the total soluble sugar content per gram dry weight was lower in the xylem than in the current spring leaves the xylem had a greater increase rate than the leaves 2 5 and 1 2 times respectively when swd treated trees were compared with cont trees furthermore the increase rates of sugars for the previous year s stem and current spring shoots were almost the same as the average value for the xylem and bark of the scaffold branches sucrose glucose and fructose were detected in the xylem tissues but glucose and fructose exhibited a greater rate of increase than sucrose under swd conditions therefore the increase in sugars was ascribed to osmoregulation meyer and boyer 1981 yakushiji et al 1996 which can decrease the water potential of the xylem causing more water to accumulate in the xylem of trunk and scaffold branches than in the leaves indeed the water potential of the xylem was approximately 1 mpa lower than that of the leaves in the swd treated trees although the trunk and scaffold branches can be regarded as water reservoirs in many tree species chapotin et al 2006 goldstein et al 1998 stratton et al 2000 we believe that no water migrated from the trunk to the leaves under drought condition in meiwa kumquat trees these findings also suggest that kumquat trees can be considered isohydric plants that maintain a constant midday leaf water potential under drought conditions by reducing their stomatal conductance to limit the transpiration rate sade et al 2012 van den bilcke et al 2013b although prolonged drought conditions may induce defoliation trees will be able to recover from this without any serious damage if the scaffold branches and trunk remain alive therefore this likely represents a survival strategy against drought in isohydric plants the sugar contents in each plant part did not significantly differ between treatments on november 2 approximately 4 months after the swd treatment during this period the trees bloomed set fruit and enlarged their fruits glucose and fructose contents in the xylem were significantly increased in cont trees by november 2 from june 20 on the other hand although it was unknown whether there was no fluctuation during this period there was no significant difference between june 20 and november 2 in swd treated trees the observed increase in monosaccharide levels in the xylem at around november may be ascribed to seasonal changes many temperate zone trees have been shown to accumulate soluble sugars in their organs from autumn to winter to acquire cold hardiness jones and steinacker 1951 sharples and burkhart 1954 yelenosky 1979 and this accumulation might have occurred in the xylem the swd treatment increased sucrose glucose and fructose content in the xylem and glucose and fructose contents in the shoot stems however all of these sugars with the exception of monosaccharides in the xylem had decreased in content by november 2 which is considered to have been due to their translocation to other plant parts these sugars may also have been used for fruit growth and the improvement of fruit quality because the fresh weight diameter and total sugar content of the fruit were significantly higher in swd treated trees than in cont trees on november 2 in swd treated trees there was a significant increase in the sucrose content of the fruit and a significant decrease in the sucrose content in the xylem by november 2 suggesting that sucrose that had accumulated in the xylem could be translocated to the fruit 5 conclusion in this study we found that the xylem of scaffold branches accumulated approximately 24 mg of total sugars per gram dry matter since the trunk and scaffold branches generally represent a high proportion of the whole tree e g approximately 30 in 10 year old kumquat trees iwasaki and hiratsuka 2019 the xylem may play a central role in the growth of trees and fruits under drought conditions further research on the effects of accumulated sugars in the xylem on the growth and quality of fruit should be undertaken in the future to elucidate the physiological roles of the trunk and scaffold branches in whole tree water relations and carbohydrate partitioning not only in fortunella but also in the closely related genus citrus

flowers that fail to produce fruitlets are followed by new flowers on the same axil approximately 2 weeks later resulting in the production of first second and third flush flowers hadano 2000 iwasaki et al 2000 iwasaki et al 2017 first flush flowers in summertime flowers exhibit high annual variability in their quantity with only a few flowers generally being produced but give rise to fruit that exhibit the fastest growth and have the highest quality as mentioned above swd treatment applied during the flower bud differentiation period increases the number of first flush flowers in summertime flowers emerging on the current spring shoots however it remains unclear why swd treatment before summertime flowering affects not only the number of first flush flowers but also fruit weight fruit quality and yield per tree at harvest which is more than 6 months after the treatment iwasaki and hiratsuka 2019 reported that lesser water was available for foliar transpiration in trees with larger trunk and old branches under drought conditions because there was a significant negative correlation between the dry weight of the trunk including old branches and the leaf water potential in meiwa kumquat trees and they suggested that transpiration from the surface of trunk and old branches continued even under drought conditions as one of the reasons the trunk of woody species is thought to function as water reservoirs that supply water for foliar transpiration under drought conditions chapotin et al 2006 van den bilcke et al 2013a 2013b however the water stored in the trunk and old branches seems not to be used to maintain the leaf water transpiration under drought conditions in meiwa kumquat trees although the possible mechanisms related to the movement of water between the trunk and the leaves are not clear the trunk and old branches may play an important role in maintaining the water relations of the whole tree thus we believe it is important to elucidate the physiological responses to drought of not only the leaves but also the trunk including the scaffold branches to assess the severity of water stress of the whole tree in the present study we investigated the accumulation of soluble sugars in plant parts due to the osmoregulation in meiwa kumquat by applying an swd treatment intended to increase first flush summertime flowers in order to elucidate the water relation of the whole tree and the role of the trunk and the scaffold branch under drought conditions was discussed in relation to the sugar accumulation in each plant part 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant materials and treatments eighteen year old meiwa kumquat fortunella crassifolia swingle trees grafted onto trifoliate orange poncirus trifiliata l raf were used for experiment in 2017 they have been planted in 2001 and since then they have grown 29 l non woven fabric pots containing commercially available humus rich soil mixed soil of coconut shell fibers bark compost loamy soil and vermiculite and have received commonly recommended cultural practices for citrus including fertilizer application plant protection pruning and some transplanting the growth of the rootstock was superior to that of the scion resulting in the typical phenomenon of rootstock overgrowth the tree heights and canopy diameters were approx 1 2 m and 1 5 m respectively during the experimental year 2017 sprouting and elongation of the spring shoots began on around may 1 and were completed by around may 23 the swd treated and non treated control cont groups were established on june 9 in a greenhouse at meiji university kawasaki kanagawa japan 35 61 n 139 55 e with five trees per group in the swd treated trees the soil water content was reduced by withholding water and the treatment ended on june 20 a small amount of water approx 300 ml was supplied when the soil water content fell to 15 v v the trees of cont and after swd treated were supplied with adequate water so that the soil water content was maintained around 30 during the treatment the soil water content in all pots was monitored at approx 10 cm depth between the trunk and the pot rim using an ech2o ec 5 soil moisture sensor meter group inc pullman wa usa data were collected every 10 min and stored in em50 and em5b digital data loggers meter group inc pullman wa usa 2 2 leaf and stem transpiration rates leaf and stem transpiration rates were determined at 9 00 h local time on june 9 12 15 17 and 20 2017 in three trees from each treatment group that showed similar level of leaf wilting leaf fold and rolling transpiration rates were determined using water stress indicator sheet wsis life care giken inc toyama japan which gives an index of the transpiration rate the principle of this method is that cobalt ii chloride changes from blue via intermediate colors to pink depending on the amount of water absorbed hoshi et al 2007 morinaga et al 2016 the wsis has a 3 5 cm2 testing area with a small filter paper approx 0 6 cm2 impregnated with cobalt ii chloride which changes color completely after absorbing 0 55 mg water fig 1 a b the perimeter of the testing area is sticky and adheres to the surface of the leaves or stems whereas the other side is covered with an impermeable material and is not affected by ambient humidity the wsis was affixed to the abaxial leaf surface to determine the level of leaf transpiration fig 1c and to the surface of the trunk or one of the scaffold branches that formed the lenticels on the bark to determine stem transpiration fig 1d the time taken for complete color change tcc was calculated in minutes and was used as an index of the transpiration rate 2 3 leaf and xylem water potential the leaf water potential was measured using a psychrometer wp4 t meter group inc pullman wa usa in an incubator maintained at 25 c two leaves per tree from each of the three trees per treatment group were collected as one sample at 9 00 h on june 12 15 17 and 20 the last day of the swd treatment at the time of leaf sampling the adaxial surface was rubbed with wet sandpaper 1000 to remove the cuticular layer the leaves were then sealed in a small plastic bag and which was enclosed in an aluminum vapor deposition film bag and placed in an incubator maintained at 25 c until measurement the stem xylem water potential was measured in one tree per treatment group by removing some of the bark from the trunk or one of the scaffold branches with a knife and attaching a stem psychrometer psy1 ict international armidale nsw aus chamber to the flattened xylem surface dixon and tyree 1984 nizinski et al 2013 data were collected every 30 min and stored in built in logger 2 4 flowering behavior ten current spring shoots that were approx 10 cm long were selected from each of the five trees in each treatment group to observe the flowering behavior the number of flowers that bloomed per day was recorded from june 21 to july 31 2017 the number of first flush flowers defined as those that bloomed from june 21 to july 10 and the total number of flowers per 100 nodes were then estimated for each tree 2 5 soluble sugar contents and fruit quality one scaffold branch was harvested from each of the three trees per treatment groups on july 20 2017 at the end of the swd treatment and on november 2 2017 when the fruit had just started to change color the plant parts were categorized as follows leaves or stems of the current spring shoots leaves or stems over 1 year old and branches over 3 year old including scaffold branches the fresh weight of each plant part was measured and were then stored at 70 c samples were freeze dried and ground to powder for analysis of the soluble sugar contents soluble sugars were extracted from 1 g of each sample with 50 ml of 80 ethanol for 24 h at 15 c the ethanol was then removed using a rotary evaporator n 1000 tokyo rika kikai co tokyo japan at 35 c following which the remaining aqueous phase was lyophilized and the residue was dissolved in 2 ml of ultrapure water to prepare an analytical sample the samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter 13hp045 an advantec group tokyo japan before being injected into a high performance liquid chromatography hplc system lc 2000plus series jasco tokyo japan equipped with a shodex sc1011 column showa denko k k tokyo that was maintained at 80 c ultrapure water was used as the mobile phase and the flow rate was 1 0 ml min 1 sucrose glucose and fructose were identified and quantified by comparison with peaks of known standards using a refractive index detector ri 2031 jasco tokyo japan five fruits of average size and rind color were selected from each of the scaffold branches harvested on november 2 2017 the fresh weights longitudinal and transverse diameters of the fruits were determined following which the fruits were stored at 70 until sugar extraction a 5 g sample of each fruit was homogenized with 50 ml of 85 ethanol and the homogenate was placed in an incubator at 15 c for 24 h the homogenate was then filtered through qualitative filter paper no 2 advantec group tokyo japan following which the ethanol was removed as described above the remaining aqueous phase was adjusted to a volume of 50 ml and the sugar contents were analyzed by hplc as described above 2 6 statistical analyses all data were analyzed using software kaleidagraph v 4 5 synergy software reading pa usa difference in the means between treatments was assessed by t tests mean separations in sugar content among the plant parts or in water potential and transpiration rate among the dates were done by tukey s honestly significant difference test when anova was significant at p 0 05 or p 0 01 correlation between leaf and stem water potential was analyzed by linear regression 3 results 3 1 changes in leaf water potential and transpiration rate of the leaf and stem during swd treatment the mean soil water contents gradually decreased to approximately 10 by june 20 as a result of the swd treatment but were maintained at 30 33 in the untreated soils data not shown the average mid morning leaf water potentials of the swd treated trees decreased from 2 3 mpa on june 12 to 4 3 mpa on june 17 and then increased to 3 4 mpa on june 20 following the application of a small amount of water on june 17 fig 2 by contrast the average mid morning leaf water potentials fluctuated around 2 0 mpa in the cont trees during the treatment period with a significant difference being detected between cont and swd treated trees on june 17 and june 20 which was the last day of swd treatment at mid morning 9 00 h the average water potentials in xylem and leaf was 1 64 mpa and 1 93 mpa respectively in cont trees on the other hand in swd treated trees the average xylem water potential was 4 31 mpa which was somewhat lower than that of the leaves 3 38 mpa and there was a significant positive correlation between the two water potentials fig 3 on june 9 the day of commencement of the swd treatment the tcc was 6 5 min for the leaves of cont trees and this remained unchanged during the treatment period table 1 by contrast the tcc was 77 min for the leaves of swd treated trees on june 12 and 100 min after june 15 at which time there was a significant difference between the tcc of cont and swd treated trees p 0 001 however the tcc of the stem did not change during the swd treatment period and exhibited no significant difference between the swd treated and cont trees even on june 20 table 1 the tcc of the stem was approx 50 min indicating that the stem transpiration rate is approximately one eighth that of the leaves 3 2 flowering behavior and sugar contents of the plant parts following swd treatment by the end of july two peaks of flowering had been observed in cont trees on july 4 and 16 whereas only one peak had been observed in swd treated trees on july 5 fig 4 a the maximum numbers of flowers bloomed per 100 nodes in a day were 28 on july 16 in cont trees and 46 on july 5 in swd treated trees while the numbers of first flush flowers were 25 per 100 nodes for cont trees and 109 per 100 nodes for swd treated trees fig 4b which represented a significant increase in swd treated trees the total number of flowers also increased slightly in swd treated trees but was not significantly different from that of cont trees the sugar contents of the various plant parts that were harvested on june 20 are shown in fig 5 a sucrose glucose and fructose were detected in all of the plant parts although there were also 2 3 unknown peaks in hplc chromatogram the total sugar content was significantly increased by the swd treatment in all plant parts except the leaves table 2 furthermore the increased rate of the total sugar content i e the proportion of sugar contents in each swd treated tree to the mean of those in cont trees tended to be higher in the xylem than in the bark or in the leaves in the cont trees sucrose was the predominant sugar in all organs except the stems and leaves of the current spring shoots fig 5a in which there were no significant differences among the three types of sugars in the stems and glucose had the highest content in the leaves in the swd treated trees the glucose and fructose contents appeared to increase in the stems of the previous year s and current spring shoots but there was no marked increase in any of the three sugars in the leaves with the exception of glucose in the previous year s leaves all three sugars increased in the xylem of the scaffold branches of swd treated trees however particularly the monosaccharides such as glucose and fructose with the increased rate being significantly higher for glucose and fructose than for sucrose 12 4 6 0 and 1 5 respectively table 3 although a large amount of sucrose was detected in the bark of the scaffold branches only small amounts of glucose and fructose were observed the amount of sucrose in the bark was significantly higher in swd treated trees whereas there was little or no difference in the monosaccharides fig 5a the increased rate of the monosaccharides were also significantly different from that of sucrose in the stems of the previous year s and current spring shoots table 3 there were no significant differences in the sugar contents between treatments in any of the plant parts that were harvested on november 2 fig 5b there was no change in the contents of monosaccharides in the xylem of the scaffold branches in swd treated trees from june 20 to nov 2 whereas these significantly increased in cont trees fig 6 a nevertheless the sucrose decreased significantly in swd treated trees but did not change in cont trees in the stem of the current spring shoots the content of three sugars did not change from june 20 to nov 2 in cont whereas only monosaccharides contents that increased significantly by swd treatment significantly decreased during this period in swd treated trees fig 6b the sucrose contents in the leaves of the current spring shoots significantly increased in both cont trees and swd treated trees whereas monosaccharides contents significantly decreased between june 20 and nov 2 fig 6c the fruit weights and diameters of the fruit harvested on november 2 were significantly higher in swd treated trees than in cont trees fig 7 a the total sugar content was also higher in the fruit from swd treated trees than in that from cont trees fig 7b in terms of the individual sugars sucrose glucose and fructose were detected in all fruit with sucrose being predominant but only the sucrose content was significantly higher in the fruit of swd treated trees than cont trees 4 discussion in this study the swd treatment significantly reduced the mid morning leaf water potential to below 4 0 mpa and significantly increased the number of first flush summertime flowers indicating that the trees to which the swd treatment was applied were exposed to severe water stress conditions in our previous study the number of first flush summertime flowers increased by the swd treatment which decrease the mid morning leaf water potential to 3 0 mpa unpublished data as the sunny day continued during this swd treatment the mid morning leaf water potential decreased rapidly and was much lower than adequate value however there were no serious damages on the trees besides a few defoliation the terms first flush flower and second flush flower were first used by iwahori and tominaga 1986 in an article presenting the effects of paclobutrazol on the number of first flush flowers in meiwa kumquat these authors examined the difference in the shoots on which first and second flush flowers emerged and concluded that it was very difficult to judge which type of flower a given shoot would bear since then it has been shown that the first second and third flush of flowers of meiwa kumquat are all summertime flowers that are borne on spring shoots that elongate in may in japan iwasaki et al 2000 iwasaki and yamaguchi 2004 and so represent continuous flowering on the same axils of the same spring shoots in the present study the swd treatment increased the number of first flush summertime flowers but did not affect the total number of summertime flowers that emerged on the spring shoots supporting the findings of iwasaki et al 2017 therefore it is considered that swd treatment accelerates the development of differentiated flower buds rather than it increases the number of flower buds that differentiate iwasaki et al 2000 ono et al 2010 there was a rapid decrease in transpiration from the leaves in swd treated trees with little transpiration being detectable by day 6 of the treatment june 15 whereas there was no significant change in the leaf transpiration rate in cont trees over the same period however the transpiration of the stem expressed as tcc which varied from 40 to 66 min did not change during the treatment period for either group the transpiration rate of the stem under non stressed conditions was approximately one eighth that of the leaves the bark of the trunk and the old branches 3 year old was lignified and has formed lenticels that conduct gas exchange and release water into the atmosphere lendzian 2006 although there is seasonal variation in lenticular transpiration the lenticels cannot regulate the transpiration rate lendzian 2006 because they do not close the transpiration of the leaves decrease rapidly under swd but that of the stem remained stable therefore it is considered that the release of water from the tree under drought conditions depends on the stem rather than the leaves thus implying that regulation of transpiration from the stem would allow plants to use less water more efficiently for tree growth and fruit production these findings may help to establish new techniques for saving irrigation water by reducing tree water consumption which is an important issue in many citrus production areas around the world carr 2012 gasquea et al 2016 panigrahi and srivastava 2016 on the other hand the sugar content of the fruit tended to increase under drought conditions which is known to improve the quality of many citrus fruits kadoya 1973 panigrahi and srivastava 2016 yakushiji et al 1996 1998 therefore it may be possible to increase the sugar content of the fruits by release excess moisture from the tree through the lenticels which is never close even during the night as unlike the stomatal pores we found that swd treated kumquat trees accumulated sugars in their scaffold branch particularly in the xylem as well as in the other plant parts although the total soluble sugar content per gram dry weight was lower in the xylem than in the current spring leaves the xylem had a greater increase rate than the leaves 2 5 and 1 2 times respectively when swd treated trees were compared with cont trees furthermore the increase rates of sugars for the previous year s stem and current spring shoots were almost the same as the average value for the xylem and bark of the scaffold branches sucrose glucose and fructose were detected in the xylem tissues but glucose and fructose exhibited a greater rate of increase than sucrose under swd conditions therefore the increase in sugars was ascribed to osmoregulation meyer and boyer 1981 yakushiji et al 1996 which can decrease the water potential of the xylem causing more water to accumulate in the xylem of trunk and scaffold branches than in the leaves indeed the water potential of the xylem was approximately 1 mpa lower than that of the leaves in the swd treated trees although the trunk and scaffold branches can be regarded as water reservoirs in many tree species chapotin et al 2006 goldstein et al 1998 stratton et al 2000 we believe that no water migrated from the trunk to the leaves under drought condition in meiwa kumquat trees these findings also suggest that kumquat trees can be considered isohydric plants that maintain a constant midday leaf water potential under drought conditions by reducing their stomatal conductance to limit the transpiration rate sade et al 2012 van den bilcke et al 2013b although prolonged drought conditions may induce defoliation trees will be able to recover from this without any serious damage if the scaffold branches and trunk remain alive therefore this likely represents a survival strategy against drought in isohydric plants the sugar contents in each plant part did not significantly differ between treatments on november 2 approximately 4 months after the swd treatment during this period the trees bloomed set fruit and enlarged their fruits glucose and fructose contents in the xylem were significantly increased in cont trees by november 2 from june 20 on the other hand although it was unknown whether there was no fluctuation during this period there was no significant difference between june 20 and november 2 in swd treated trees the observed increase in monosaccharide levels in the xylem at around november may be ascribed to seasonal changes many temperate zone trees have been shown to accumulate soluble sugars in their organs from autumn to winter to acquire cold hardiness jones and steinacker 1951 sharples and burkhart 1954 yelenosky 1979 and this accumulation might have occurred in the xylem the swd treatment increased sucrose glucose and fructose content in the xylem and glucose and fructose contents in the shoot stems however all of these sugars with the exception of monosaccharides in the xylem had decreased in content by november 2 which is considered to have been due to their translocation to other plant parts these sugars may also have been used for fruit growth and the improvement of fruit quality because the fresh weight diameter and total sugar content of the fruit were significantly higher in swd treated trees than in cont trees on november 2 in swd treated trees there was a significant increase in the sucrose content of the fruit and a significant decrease in the sucrose content in the xylem by november 2 suggesting that sucrose that had accumulated in the xylem could be translocated to the fruit 5 conclusion in this study we found that the xylem of scaffold branches accumulated approximately 24 mg of total sugars per gram dry matter since the trunk and scaffold branches generally represent a high proportion of the whole tree e g approximately 30 in 10 year old kumquat trees iwasaki and hiratsuka 2019 the xylem may play a central role in the growth of trees and fruits under drought conditions further research on the effects of accumulated sugars in the xylem on the growth and quality of fruit should be undertaken in the future to elucidate the physiological roles of the trunk and scaffold branches in whole tree water relations and carbohydrate partitioning not only in fortunella but also in the closely related genus citrus 
11152,crop water productivity and return after variable cost for three major crops winter wheat grain sorghum and maize in the southwest kansas were evaluated based on simulated yield using the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer cropping system model dssat csm winter wheat and grain sorghum were treated with four irrigation capacities ics zero 1 7 2 5 and 5 mm day and an automatic irrigation irrigation when required maize was treated with three ics 0 2 5 and 5 mm day and an automatic irrigation long term simulations showed that average winter wheat grain sorghum and maize yields can be stabilized under 1 7 2 5 2 5 and 5 mm day ics with corresponding irrigation of 100 150 100 250 and 450 500 mm respectively the crop water productivities of winter wheat grain sorghum and maize ranged from 9 8 to 11 8 12 8 15 0 and 4 2 19 1 kg ha mm respectively maize was found to be profitable when grown under both deficit and full irrigation conditions although optimal irrigation application for maize substantially increased the net return after variable cost ravc the median net return after variable cost for rainfed wheat 252 ha and grain sorghum 180 ha was greater than that for irrigated wheat 169 192 ha and grain sorghum 104 110 ha the ravc for wheat and grain sorghum did not rise with increase in irrigation and ic whereas the ravc for maize increased with irrigation and ic the lowest and highest ravc for maize corresponded to ic of 0 16 ha and 5 mm day 530 ha however this income from growing maize under higher ic may not last long due to rapidly depleting groundwater levels in the underlying ogallala aquifer therefore the short term benefits of growing maize under higher ics need to be compared with the long term environmental impact food security and employment opportunities including sustaining the growing municipal and industrial water needs keywords dssat modeling net income winter wheat grain sorghum maize 1 introduction in many parts of united states us aquifers are major sources of groundwater for irrigated agriculture wichelns 2010 for example the ogallala aquifer is one of the largest aquifers utilized for irrigated agriculture in the great plains including southwest kansas recent studies showed that the groundwater levels in the ogallala aquifer are declining due to excessive pumping for irrigated agriculture in the overlying region buchanan et al 2009 mcguire 2012 this is mainly due to growing high water consumptive crops such as maize zea mays l hornbeck and keskin 2012 many reports revealed that the groundwater consumption rates are much higher than the recharge rates of the aquifer buchanan et al 2009 mcguire 2012 at present many of the wells in the ogallala region are unable to generate irrigation capacities ic needed to meet crop water requirements especially for maize warren et al 2016 therefore reduced ic is an immediate threat to irrigated crop production in the region some of the options to match water supply with crop demand are to decrease irrigated area coverage grow crops that are less water consumptive increase water productivity such as using subsurface drip irrigation technology and or drill more wells to meet the required ic warren et al 2016 in western kansas crop choices under irrigation management consider ic profitability crop preferences yield potential water use klocke et al 2006 under limited ic producers decision could be affected mainly by yield expectations water use and net income while in the case of full irrigation it is governed mainly by net income klocke et al 2006 grain sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench was reported to be well suited to a limited water environment stone and schlegel 2006 klocke et al 2012 araya et al 2016 warren et al 2016 araya et al 2017a indicated that winter wheat triticum aestivum could also be considered as an alternative rescue crop in water scarce western kansas some studies in this region showed that income from maize per unit of land was higher than that for grain sorghum whereas income from grain sorghum per unit of applied water was higher than that for maize warren et al 2016 understanding the crop water relationship together with economic analysis from long term perspectives could enhance producers ability to make informed decisions the goal of this study is to assess the performance and profitability of relatively less water consumptive crops such as grain sorghum and winter wheat as rescue crops to minimize impacts of reduced ics in comparison with high water consumptive maize crop in southwestern kansas therefore the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of irrigation ic on irrigation water productivity crop water productivity and return after variable cost for three major crops winter wheat grain sorghum and maize in the southwestern kansas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was carried out at the southwest research

model was first calibrated for phenology followed by biomass yield and et araya et al 2017c all three crops were satisfactorily simulated by the model for the days to flowering and maturity with normalized root mean squares of error nrmse of 5 2 the biomass and yield of wheat maize and grain sorghum was also simulated with r2 values of greater than 0 75 and nrmse of less than 20 the et values were also simulated with r2 of at least 0 77 and the nmrse was less than 16 overall these statistical model goodness of fit test values indicated the model satisfactorily simulated the phenology yield

three other ic treatments 1 7 mm day 25 mm in 15 days 2 5 mm day 25 mm in 10 days and 5 mm day 25 mm in 5 days were scheduled during the crop growing period considering the local practice ic sensitive crop stages climate and soil conditions as presented in table 1 the automatic irrigation was included to know the yield under adequate irrigation water need which could enable to evaluate the performance of the crops in relation to the other selected irrigation treatments although growing maize under rainfed condition rainfed is too risky not a common practice we have also included it for comparisons with two other ic 2 5 and 5 mm day and an automatic irrigation treatment the irrigation efficiency and water applied per irrigation event was set in the model as 85 and 25 mm respectively the silt loam soil in the model was used with minor adjustments to match the soil data from the study site the following assumptions were also made based on the site information the initial soil water content and nitrogen n levels were taken as 65 and 15 kg n ha respectively three major crops winter wheat grain sorghum and maize were considered for scenario analysis using long term 1950 2013 climatic data obtained from garden city ks nitrogen fertilizer was applied at a rate of 34 and 126 kg ha for winter wheat 22 and 73 kg ha for grain sorghum and 22 and 204 kg ha for maize at time of planting and a month after planting respectively considered optimal for the study site 2 3 data and scenario analysis information on net return after variable cost from irrigated and non irrigated crops for southwest kansas was obtained from historic records of the kansas farm management association as posted on the kansas state university agmanager website https www agmanager info kfma enterprise reports accessed nov 2017 the net return after the variable cost ravc is calculated as gross income minus variable cost the gross income includes crop operator s share patronage refund

conservation and auto expense the available long term 1995 2016 ravc information for each crop both irrigated and non irrigated wheat grain sorghum and maize was arranged in descending order and ranked and exceedance probabilities of income for 50 1 out of 2 years were calculated as presented by raes et al 1996 2006 the ravc values for the selected exceedance probability was then multiplied by the simulated yield for each crop over the simulation period 64 years ravc per hectare ha over the long term simulations were then averaged similarly the median ravc values for each of the crops were calculated relationships between crop yield and irrigation crop yield and et yield and irrigation capacity and crop water productivity and irrigation were plotted for each crop based on long term average simulated data grassini et al 2011 reported that irrigation water productivities iwp are important to understand efficiencies of irrigation water application the iwp is calculated as the quantity of yield obtained under irrigation minus the yield under rainfed and divided by the applied net irrigation as presented in irmak et al 2011 similarly improving crop water productivity cwp was reported to be beneficial to i reduce water loss and improve water use ii reduce land under irrigation iii reduce the cost of production as well as to increase income and employment opportunities molden et al 2010 and iv balance between water consumption for producing food and better ecosystem services oweis and hachum 2003 accordingly cwp was calculated for each crop by dividing the average long term yield of each crop by their average long term actual crop water used et as presented in araya et al 2017a 2 4 assumptions and limitations during the long term simulation the crops were assumed to be grown on a continuous cropping system with same agronomic practices although these practices are commonly observed in the study region there are many factors affecting the farming decision making process regarding type of crop to grow cropping system to follow and associated management practices for example among others climate may force producers to decrease or increase fertilizer rate or irrigation applications etc another limitation of this study is that except one of the treatments the automatic irrigation irrigation scheduling did not vary with seasonal climatic condition however we believe this assumption is representative and reasonable as i water needs of sensitive crop growth stages during which most producers apply from average climate perspective was met ii while it minimizes complexities most common irrigation practices by producers in the study site were adopted for example two three irrigation scheduling options were considered per ic for each crop to represent producer s irrigation practices with seasonal climatic variations iii producer s minimum yield levels can be met with lower ic especially for grain sorghum araya et al 2018 and wheat under review and iv under normal condition the most common irrigation application amount per irrigation event with center pivot system in western kansas is often fixed 1 inch or approximately 25 mm other limitations such as the selection of crop varieties may not represent all the crop varieties grown across the region for the period under consideration choice of the right crop cultivars might produce yield differences eventually affecting income ravc can also change due to price fluctuations under present and future trade policy shift notwithstanding the disclosed limitations this work could provide guidance to better understand the effect of irrigation ic on iwp and ravc for winter wheat grain sorghum and maize in the southwest kansas 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation and yield relations winter wheat in southwestern kansas grows well with or without irrigation the relationship between wheat yield and irrigation is presented in fig 3 a the figure shows that winter wheat in western kansas did not respond to irrigation with further increase after 150 mm winter wheat performed better under lower ics 1 7 2 5 mm day with seasonal irrigation of 150 mm table 2 in this study the optimal irrigation simulated by the model using an automatic irrigation strategy was 235 mm however this irrigation amount did not result in substantially higher yield than the yield simulated based on irrigation of 150 mm table 2 however irrigation beyond 150 mm did not increase yield significantly thus it is possible to optimize winter wheat yield with only 150 mm irrigation however irrigation should target the most sensitive stages of the crop stem elongation to booting anthesis and grain filling zhang and oweis 1999 zhang et al 1999 araya et al 2017a used a simulation model to test the sensitivity of wheat growth stages to water stress verifying that booting to heading followed by early grain filling and stem elongation are the most sensitive stages of winter wheat in western kansas the relationship between yield and irrigation for grain sorghum is presented in fig 3b the figure shows the low response of grain sorghum after application of 100 150 mm irrigation tolk and howell 2003 reported that climate and soil factors could affect et and irrigation needs grain sorghum showed yield increase with irrigation up to 150 mm after which yield peaked table 3 fig 3b this irrigation amount was slightly lower than that simulated by the model using automatic irrigation to achieve similar yield level table 3 klocke et al 2012 reported that grain sorghum is well suited to rainfed environment consistently the outcomes obtained from the simulations found that grain sorghum was more responsive to deficit irrigation when irrigation is applied during the critical growing period depending on the climatic season deficit irrigation of 100 250 mm at lower ics 1 7 2 5 mm day was found to be optimal for grain sorghum prior studies showed that grain sorghum has a well developed root system and is capable of closing its stomata rolling its leaves during severe water stress munamava and riddoch 2001 wani et al 2012 a study by klocke et al 2012 verified that grain sorghum receiving 25 of full irrigation used about 56 mm more stored soil moisture however in this study rainfed grain sorghum yielded significantly lower relative to when the crop was grown under deficit irrigation the latter outcome suggests that grain sorghum should be irrigated during the sensitive stages especially during the below normal or dry years according to araya et al 2018 grain sorghum responds well to irrigation applied between panicle initiation and maturity the effects of water stress on sensitive stages of grain sorghum are documented in previous studies for example wani et al 2012 reported that grain sorghum is sensitive to water stress during panicle initiations limiting the number of grains and panicle size severe water stress at i flowering stage may reduce pollination ii early grain filling may reduce individual grain weight and iii severe stress at late grain filling could lead to early senescence wani et al 2012 the relationship between irrigation and simulated maize yield is presented in fig 3c the simulated maize yield increased with irrigation up to certain level depending on the growing season precipitation the highest and lowest maize yields in our study were 13 2 and 1 06 mg ha respectively which corresponded to net irrigation application of 600 mm under 5 mm day ic and rainfed no irrigation condition respectively table 4 fig 3c fig 4 however the relationship between irrigation and observed maize yield in the same site was found to be curvilinear klocke et al 2014 the disparity might be caused by fewer simulation scenarios in our study schneekloth et al 2012 reported that maize under higher ic targeting mainly the mid season stage could improve yield rudnick et al 2017 suggested various deficit irrigation strategies to meet the potential water demand of the crop at most sensitive stages the same authors concluded that maize is very sensitive to water stress from flowering to grain filling for example severe water stress during tasseling and ear formation could result in a reduction of yield by 66 93 cakir 2004 payero et al 2006 reported that water stress can have multiple impacts such as shortening of maturity reduced canopy growth reduced root development and reduced yield in addition stress before or at the time of silking can reduce the number of kernels and stress at the time of silking or afterwards can reduce kernel weight payero et al 2006 in this study it was found that maize yield could be improved with deficit irrigation targeting critical stages but could still be significantly lower than that with full irrigation 3 2 effects of irrigation capacity the relationships between yield and ic for winter wheat grain sorghum and maize is presented in figs 4 both winter wheat and grain sorghum perform well under lower 1 7 2 5 mm day ics at which yield was peaked almost flat likewise araya et al 2018 reported that grain sorghum yield could be stabilized at ic of about 2 5 mm day in contrast maize yield significantly increased with increased ic up to 5 mm day fig 4 maize yield substantially improved under ic of 5 mm day with irrigation water application 300 mm targeting only the sensitive stages whereas yield under deficit irrigation 300 mm with an ic of 2 5 mm day resulted in significantly lower yield the relationship between maize yield and ic was linear r2 0 90 fig 4 lamm 2004 reported that the relationship between ic and maize yield was polynomial this difference may be caused by the relatively limited ranges of ic 0 2 5 and 5 mm day used to evaluate the relationship between yield and ic in this study fig 4 producers with lower ic should consider maximizing yield from a relatively smaller area so that they could meet the potential water need of the crop with higher ic while reducing their production costs lamm et al 2007 found a minimum ic of 6 mm day to meet the potential water requirement of maize with application efficiency of 95 for northwestern kansas alternatively producers with lower ic could also maximize yield and increase total production from total area by growing grain sorghum with limited irrigation 100 mm water targeting sensitive stages only 3 3 yield and crop water use et there was weak linear relationship between winter wheat yield and et r2 0 3 fig 5 a the rate of et increase did not result in proportional yield increase fig 5a because evaporation and nutrient losses may increase with irrigation sensitivity analysis indicated winter wheat seems to respond more to n application if water is available in adequate quantity not shown other studies also showed that n application in the great plains was below the n demand for potential production when compared to the n rate used in other countries lollato et al 2017 zhang and oweis 1999 reported a linear relationship between yield and et for wheat difference in the yield et response models might be caused due to climatic effect climate affects the evaporative demand of the atmosphere or difference in n uptake availability for example non productive soil evaporation was reported to reach up to 60 of the seasonal et in some areas of the mediterranean where crop growth is slow early in the growing season oweis et al 2000 such conditions could affect the rate of change in yield in relation to et in this study wheat crop et ranged on an average from 331 mm for rainfed to 533 mm for fully irrigated with a yield of 3 9 and 5 8 mg ha respectively table 2 there was linear relationship between grain sorghum yield and et fig 5b the et for grain sorghum ranged from 336 mm for rainfed to 469 mm for fully irrigated table 3 fig 5b these et values are partially in agreement with the range reported by klocke et al 2012 for southwestern kansas and by tolk and howell 2003 for the texas high plains the least irrigated grain sorghum in our study consumed 77 of the et demand to produce 91 of the yield relative to the optimally irrigated scenario this agrees with klocke et al 2012 who reported that grain sorghum grown under the least irrigated driest treatment consumed about of 87 of the et demand to produce 91 of the yield relative to the fully irrigated condition in this study simulated maize et varied with ic the lowest and highest et were simulated under ic of 0 mm day 254 mm and 5 mm day 781 mm respectively however at optimum irrigation simulated et ranged from 660 to 700 mm table 4 which is partially in agreement with araya et al 2017b in contrast under moderate ic 2 5 mm day simulated maize et ranged from 545 to 580 mm there was a linear relationship between et and yield with a r2 of 0 78 figs 5c payero et al 2006 also reported a strong linear relationship between yield and et overall maize was found to be very responsive to irrigation water and its yield was improved with the increase in et 3 4 crop water productivity cwp the lowest cwp for winter wheat was found to be 9 8 kg ha mm in the case of the highest irrigated wheat 523 mm while the highest cwp 11 8 kg ha mm corresponded to zero irrigation or the least irrigated wheat table 5 in contrast wang et al 2016 obtained an average of 1 84 kg m3 which is higher than that of wheat grown in southwest kansas because the cultivars used in that study might be more responsive to management practices such as higher seeding rate compared to this study the cwp of grain sorghum was greater than that of winter wheat and could reach up to 15 0 kg ha mm table 5 even the lowest cwp for grain sorghum 12 7 kg ha mm was slightly greater than that of the highest cwp 11 8 kg ha mm for wheat molden et al 2010 reported that c3 crops such as winter wheat is less water efficient than those c4 crops like grain sorghum in a long term 2001 2010 cropping system study schlegel et al 2012 reported that average cwp winter wheat was lower than grain sorghum and the cwp of grain sorghum was lower than that of maize the highest cwp for maize was 19 1 kg ha mm for an automatic irrigation irrigation when required followed by deficit and full irrigation strategies under ic of 5 mm day 17 18 kg ha mm these levels of maize cwps are higher than that of grain sorghum and winter wheat unlike grain sorghum maize can hardly yield without irrigation under environments with severe water deficit lower precipitation for example the average yield for rainfed maize in southwestern kansas was 1 06 mg ha which is lower than average yield of grain sorghum 4 3 mg ha in this study the lowest cwp 4 2 kg ha mm for irrigated maize corresponded to the lowest ic 0 mm day increased ic from 2 5 to 5 mm day with only 300 mm targeting sensitive growth stages could increase maize cwp from 12 7 to about 18 2 kg ha mm table 5 this shows that under high ic it is possible to meet the water demand of the most critical stages of maize even using a deficit irrigation strategy which would eventually improve cwp however payero et al 2006 indicated that using a deficit irrigation practice with the aim of improving cwp may not be a better strategy producers could be more motivated with the income they gain than the water they saved and thus profitability may be a better measure of success than crop water productivity according to molden et al 2010 improving cwp could depend on many factors that includes cost factors profitability and government incentives marketability education water policy and institutional structures 3 5 irrigation water productivity iwp the highest iwp iwp calculated as irrigated minus rainfed crop yield divided by the amount of irrigation for wheat 11 0 kg ha mm and grain sorghum 20 0 kg ha mm seem to be achievable by applying deficit irrigation of about 100 mm table 5 in contrast the lowest iwp for winter wheat and grain sorghum were 3 4 and 5 5 kg ha mm respectively the lowest iwp occurred with an ic of 5 mm day with total seasonal irrigation applications of 350 and 400 mm respectively this implies that irrigation water was efficiently utilized when winter wheat and grain sorghum were treated with lower ics 1 7 2 5 mm day in southwestern kansas with 85 90 irrigation efficiency efficiency of irrigation also depends on soil characteristics crop type response of crop and irrigation method performance and uniformity of application used irmak et al 2011 the highest iwp 28 0 kg ha mm for maize was obtained at an ic of 5 mm day with net deficit irrigation application of only 300 mm table 5 in contrast the lowest iwp 16 0 kg ha mm was obtained under net irrigation application of 400 mm with an ic of 2 5 mm day iwp values could show how efficiently the irrigation water was utilized by the crop under a given ic however when it comes to maize producers might be interested in increasing income while reducing cost studies indicated that maize requires adequate water during its growing period in order to produce high yield araya et al 2017b payero et al 2006 revealed that limited deficit irrigation may not be advantageous over full irrigation therefore for regions with lower ics growing drought tolerant crops with limited irrigation adee et al 2016 water might be advisable in terms of iwp for example high iwp 15 20 0 kg ha mm can be obtained at ic of 1 7 mm day from grain sorghum by applying 100 150 mm of irrigation water table 5 whereas for regions with higher ics 5 mm day it might be possible to obtain relatively higher iwp 23 28 0 kg ha mm by growing maize by using more irrigation water 300 450 mm than that required by grain sorghum however it might be possible to obtain greater iwp and greater total production from an extensive grain sorghum area by applying 100 mm irrigation water than from growing maize with the same amount of irrigation water 3 6 return after variable cost versus irrigation capacity the long term 1950 2013 median and average ravc for wheat grain sorghum and maize is presented in tables 6 8 the ravc for rainfed wheat and grain sorghum were superior relative to irrigated wheat and grain sorghum with ravc not increasing with irrigation for example the estimated median ravc for rainfed and irrigated wheat was at least 252 and 169 ha respectively table 6 similarly rainfed grain sorghum was more profitable than irrigated table 7 lamm et al 2007 also reported that grain sorghum is more profitable under rainfed system than irrigated in contrast maize yield and ravc increased with increase in ic other studies indicated that net income from maize could increase under higher ic when compared to those maize grown under lower ics 5 1 mm day lamm et al 2007 the current study showed that it is possible to obtain a median ravc of at least 530 ha from maize under ic of 5 mm day when compared to 16 ha under rainfed ic 0 mm day producers could obtain at least an average ravc of 281 per ha if they want to grow maize under deficit irrigation with irrigation capacity of 2 5 mm day for 1 out of 2 years this shows that a producer may get better income from fully irrigated maize over large farms and could provide some employment this study showed that winter wheat and grain sorghum could be more profitable if grown without irrigation winter wheat seems more profitable than grain sorghum since it is grown during the winter period its success is usually challenged by extreme weather events which are difficult to capture with crop models weather hazards such as frost hail and other factors could influence the productivity records showed that the seasonal production success for winter wheat in the region was less than grain sorghum for example schlegel et al 2012 reported that winter freeze and hail substantially damaged winter wheat which reduced profit when compared to maize and grain sorghum however both grain sorghum and winter wheat have the capability to grow without irrigation or with smaller number of irrigations per season when compared to maize the lower requirement on irrigation needs would reduce the pressure on the aquifer while decreasing production costs both crops can also be grown in rotation it is also possible to obtain greater total production especially from grain sorghum under rainfed production system which makes it very suitable crop for producer with limited irrigation capacity than many other crops this ability of grain sorghum to produce greater yield from total area under rainfed condition allows growers to supply feed to their animals throughout the year while sustainably maintaining the environment future employment and food security in the region it is also possible to optimize winter wheat and grain sorghum yield with irrigation of about 100 150 mm and 100 250 mm respectively which is by far lower than the optimal irrigation requirements for maize 450 mm however the income gained per given area from winter wheat or grain sorghum was almost less than 50 of that income gained from fully irrigated maize in contrast it is less likely to grow maize under rainfed condition as documented in this modeling analysis maize could be more profitable if grown under full than deficit irrigation in addition the income improved as irrigation water increased due to the increase in maize yield however the aquifer is facing pressure whereby producers are withdrawing groundwater for irrigation with little or no recharge this would make the future employment uncertain as cities and industries in the region also depend on this water income and employment opportunities from growing maize may not last longer than 25 years from now depending on the production location within ogallala aquifer region this would mean the short term profitability and employment opportunities need to be compared with the long term environmental impact and food security 4 conclusions winter wheat and grain sorghum could do best under lower ics of 1 7 and 1 7 2 5 mm day respectively whereas maize could grow best at minimum ic of 5 mm day winter wheat and grain sorghum can be optimized with an average deficit irrigation of 100 150 and 100 250 mm respectively whereas maize requires about 450 mm the average cwp for irrigated winter wheat grain sorghum and maize ranged between 9 8 and 11 8 12 8 and 15 0 and 4 2 and 19 1 kg ha mm respectively the iwp for the respective crops ranged 3 4 11 0 5 5 to 20 0 and 16 28 0 kg ha mm respectively this study showed if maize is grown under full irrigation ic 5 mm day it could generate an average net return after variable cost of 534 ha for 1 out of 2 years however growing winter wheat and grain sorghum under irrigation was less profitable 180 194 per ha for winter wheat and 105 109 per ha for grain sorghum winter wheat and grain sorghum could be grown without irrigation generating a net return after variable cost of at least 242 and 188 ha for 1 out of 2 years respectively this study was conducted with the assumption that the selected crop varieties together with the most common management practices and estimated costs presented in enterprise report might give some indicators of effect of ic on iwp cwp and return after variable cost for three major crops winter wheat grain sorghum and maize in the southwestern kansas the approaches used in this work might be useful for guiding producer s decision in optimizing resources and selecting crops and cropping systems based on economic and water use efficiency

11152,crop water productivity and return after variable cost for three major crops winter wheat grain sorghum and maize in the southwest kansas were evaluated based on simulated yield using the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer cropping system model dssat csm winter wheat and grain sorghum were treated with four irrigation capacities ics zero 1 7 2 5 and 5 mm day and an automatic irrigation irrigation when required maize was treated with three ics 0 2 5 and 5 mm day and an automatic irrigation long term simulations showed that average winter wheat grain sorghum and maize yields can be stabilized under 1 7 2 5 2 5 and 5 mm day ics with corresponding irrigation of 100 150 100 250 and 450 500 mm respectively the crop water productivities of winter wheat grain sorghum and maize ranged from 9 8 to 11 8 12 8 15 0 and 4 2 19 1 kg ha mm respectively maize was found to be profitable when grown under both deficit and full irrigation conditions although optimal irrigation application for maize substantially increased the net return after variable cost ravc the median net return after variable cost for rainfed wheat 252 ha and grain sorghum 180 ha was greater than that for irrigated wheat 169 192 ha and grain sorghum 104 110 ha the ravc for wheat and grain sorghum did not rise with increase in irrigation and ic whereas the ravc for maize increased with irrigation and ic the lowest and highest ravc for maize corresponded to ic of 0 16 ha and 5 mm day 530 ha however this income from growing maize under higher ic may not last long due to rapidly depleting groundwater levels in the underlying ogallala aquifer therefore the short term benefits of growing maize under higher ics need to be compared with the long term environmental impact food security and employment opportunities including sustaining the growing municipal and industrial water needs keywords dssat modeling net income winter wheat grain sorghum maize 1 introduction in many parts of united states us aquifers are major sources of groundwater for irrigated agriculture wichelns 2010 for example the ogallala aquifer is one of the largest aquifers utilized for irrigated agriculture in the great plains including southwest kansas recent studies showed that the groundwater levels in the ogallala aquifer are declining due to excessive pumping for irrigated agriculture in the overlying region buchanan et al 2009 mcguire 2012 this is mainly due to growing high water consumptive crops such as maize zea mays l hornbeck and keskin 2012 many reports revealed that the groundwater consumption rates are much higher than the recharge rates of the aquifer buchanan et al 2009 mcguire 2012 at present many of the wells in the ogallala region are unable to generate irrigation capacities ic needed to meet crop water requirements especially for maize warren et al 2016 therefore reduced ic is an immediate threat to irrigated crop production in the region some of the options to match water supply with crop demand are to decrease irrigated area coverage grow crops that are less water consumptive increase water productivity such as using subsurface drip irrigation technology and or drill more wells to meet the required ic warren et al 2016 in western kansas crop choices under irrigation management consider ic profitability crop preferences yield potential water use klocke et al 2006 under limited ic producers decision could be affected mainly by yield expectations water use and net income while in the case of full irrigation it is governed mainly by net income klocke et al 2006 grain sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench was reported to be well suited to a limited water environment stone and schlegel 2006 klocke et al 2012 araya et al 2016 warren et al 2016 araya et al 2017a indicated that winter wheat triticum aestivum could also be considered as an alternative rescue crop in water scarce western kansas some studies in this region showed that income from maize per unit of land was higher than that for grain sorghum whereas income from grain sorghum per unit of applied water was higher than that for maize warren et al 2016 understanding the crop water relationship together with economic analysis from long term perspectives could enhance producers ability to make informed decisions the goal of this study is to assess the performance and profitability of relatively less water consumptive crops such as grain sorghum and winter wheat as rescue crops to minimize impacts of reduced ics in comparison with high water consumptive maize crop in southwestern kansas therefore the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of irrigation ic on irrigation water productivity crop water productivity and return after variable cost for three major crops winter wheat grain sorghum and maize in the southwestern kansas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was carried out at the southwest research extension center 38 01 20 87 n latitude and 100 49 26 95 w longitude and elevation of 887 m above mean sea level kansas state university near garden city ks us the long term 1950 2013 annual precipitation and estimated reference evapotranspiration eto based on fao penman monteith allen et al 1998 fao 2009 were approximately 455 mm and 1405 mm respectively the growing season precipitation

precipitation versus mean monthly et value for garden city kansas is presented in fig 1 the growing season mean maximum and minimum temperatures were 28 3 and 12 3 c respectively the long term mean daily maximum and minimum temperatures are presented in fig 2 a b the soil in the study area is deep well drained ulysses silt loam with field capacity wilting point and saturation of 33 15 and 46 vol respectively klocke et al 2012 2 2 agronomic management and model setting the dssat csm calibrated for winter wheat grain sorghum and maize as presented in araya et al 2017c was used in this study the model was first calibrated for phenology followed by biomass yield and et araya et al 2017c all three crops were satisfactorily simulated by the model for the days to flowering and maturity with normalized root mean squares of error nrmse of 5 2 the biomass and yield of wheat maize and grain sorghum was also simulated with r2 values of greater than 0 75 and nrmse of less than 20 the et values were also simulated with r2 of at least 0 77 and the nmrse was less than 16 overall these statistical model goodness of fit test values indicated the model satisfactorily simulated the phenology yield biomass and et of the experimental crops soler et al 2007 araya et al 2017c there were four ic 0 1 7 2 5 and 5 mm day and one automatic irrigation treatments the 0 mm day is rainfed while each of the three other ic treatments 1 7 mm day 25 mm in 15 days 2 5 mm day 25 mm in 10 days and 5 mm day 25 mm in 5 days were scheduled during the crop growing period considering the local practice ic sensitive crop stages climate and soil conditions as presented in table 1 the automatic irrigation was included to know the yield under adequate irrigation water need which could enable to evaluate the performance of the crops in relation to the other selected irrigation treatments although growing maize under rainfed condition rainfed is too risky not a common practice we have also included it for comparisons with two other ic 2 5 and 5 mm day and an automatic irrigation treatment the irrigation efficiency and water applied per irrigation event was set in the model as 85 and 25 mm respectively the silt loam soil in the model was used with minor adjustments to match the soil data from the study site the following assumptions were also made based on the site information the initial soil water content and nitrogen n levels were taken as 65 and 15 kg n ha respectively three major crops winter wheat grain sorghum and maize were considered for scenario analysis using long term 1950 2013 climatic data obtained from garden city ks nitrogen fertilizer was applied at a rate of 34 and 126 kg ha for winter wheat 22 and 73 kg ha for grain sorghum and 22 and 204 kg ha for maize at time of planting and a month after planting respectively considered optimal for the study site 2 3 data and scenario analysis information on net return after variable cost from irrigated and non irrigated crops for southwest kansas was obtained from historic records of the kansas farm management association as posted on the kansas state university agmanager website https www agmanager info kfma enterprise reports accessed nov 2017 the net return after the variable cost ravc is calculated as gross income minus variable cost the gross income includes crop operator s share patronage refund government payments miscellaneous income crop insurance proceeds and grain futures the variable cost includes hired labor general machinery repairs interest paid seed other crop expense crop insurance fertilizer lime machine hire lease farm org fees travels publications gas oil fuel crop storage marketing personal property tax general farm insurance utilities cash farm rent herbicide insecticide conservation and auto expense the available long term 1995 2016 ravc information for each crop both irrigated and non irrigated wheat grain sorghum and maize was arranged in descending order and ranked and exceedance probabilities of income for 50 1 out of 2 years were calculated as presented by raes et al 1996 2006 the ravc values for the selected exceedance probability was then multiplied by the simulated yield for each crop over the simulation period 64 years ravc per hectare ha over the long term simulations were then averaged similarly the median ravc values for each of the crops were calculated relationships between crop yield and irrigation crop yield and et yield and irrigation capacity and crop water productivity and irrigation were plotted for each crop based on long term average simulated data grassini et al 2011 reported that irrigation water productivities iwp are important to understand efficiencies of irrigation water application the iwp is calculated as the quantity of yield obtained under irrigation minus the yield under rainfed and divided by the applied net irrigation as presented in irmak et al 2011 similarly improving crop water productivity cwp was reported to be beneficial to i reduce water loss and improve water use ii reduce land under irrigation iii reduce the cost of production as well as to increase income and employment opportunities molden et al 2010 and iv balance between water consumption for producing food and better ecosystem services oweis and hachum 2003 accordingly cwp was calculated for each crop by dividing the average long term yield of each crop by their average long term actual crop water used et as presented in araya et al 2017a 2 4 assumptions and limitations during the long term simulation the crops were assumed to be grown on a continuous cropping system with same agronomic practices although these practices are commonly observed in the study region there are many factors affecting the farming decision making process regarding type of crop to grow cropping system to follow and associated management practices for example among others climate may force producers to decrease or increase fertilizer rate or irrigation applications etc another limitation of this study is that except one of the treatments the automatic irrigation irrigation scheduling did not vary with seasonal climatic condition however we believe this assumption is representative and reasonable as i water needs of sensitive crop growth stages during which most producers apply from average climate perspective was met ii while it minimizes complexities most common irrigation practices by producers in the study site were adopted for example two three irrigation scheduling options were considered per ic for each crop to represent producer s irrigation practices with seasonal climatic variations iii producer s minimum yield levels can be met with lower ic especially for grain sorghum araya et al 2018 and wheat under review and iv under normal condition the most common irrigation application amount per irrigation event with center pivot system in western kansas is often fixed 1 inch or approximately 25 mm other limitations such as the selection of crop varieties may not represent all the crop varieties grown across the region for the period under consideration choice of the right crop cultivars might produce yield differences eventually affecting income ravc can also change due to price fluctuations under present and future trade policy shift notwithstanding the disclosed limitations this work could provide guidance to better understand the effect of irrigation ic on iwp and ravc for winter wheat grain sorghum and maize in the southwest kansas 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation and yield relations winter wheat in southwestern kansas grows well with or without irrigation the relationship between wheat yield and irrigation is presented in fig 3 a the figure shows that winter wheat in western kansas did not respond to irrigation with further increase after 150 mm winter wheat performed better under lower ics 1 7 2 5 mm day with seasonal irrigation of 150 mm table 2 in this study the optimal irrigation simulated by the model using an automatic irrigation strategy was 235 mm however this irrigation amount did not result in substantially higher yield than the yield simulated based on irrigation of 150 mm table 2 however irrigation beyond 150 mm did not increase yield significantly thus it is possible to optimize winter wheat yield with only 150 mm irrigation however irrigation should target the most sensitive stages of the crop stem elongation to booting anthesis and grain filling zhang and oweis 1999 zhang et al 1999 araya et al 2017a used a simulation model to test the sensitivity of wheat growth stages to water stress verifying that booting to heading followed by early grain filling and stem elongation are the most sensitive stages of winter wheat in western kansas the relationship between yield and irrigation for grain sorghum is presented in fig 3b the figure shows the low response of grain sorghum after application of 100 150 mm irrigation tolk and howell 2003 reported that climate and soil factors could affect et and irrigation needs grain sorghum showed yield increase with irrigation up to 150 mm after which yield peaked table 3 fig 3b this irrigation amount was slightly lower than that simulated by the model using automatic irrigation to achieve similar yield level table 3 klocke et al 2012 reported that grain sorghum is well suited to rainfed environment consistently the outcomes obtained from the simulations found that grain sorghum was more responsive to deficit irrigation when irrigation is applied during the critical growing period depending on the climatic season deficit irrigation of 100 250 mm at lower ics 1 7 2 5 mm day was found to be optimal for grain sorghum prior studies showed that grain sorghum has a well developed root system and is capable of closing its stomata rolling its leaves during severe water stress munamava and riddoch 2001 wani et al 2012 a study by klocke et al 2012 verified that grain sorghum receiving 25 of full irrigation used about 56 mm more stored soil moisture however in this study rainfed grain sorghum yielded significantly lower relative to when the crop was grown under deficit irrigation the latter outcome suggests that grain sorghum should be irrigated during the sensitive stages especially during the below normal or dry years according to araya et al 2018 grain sorghum responds well to irrigation applied between panicle initiation and maturity the effects of water stress on sensitive stages of grain sorghum are documented in previous studies for example wani et al 2012 reported that grain sorghum is sensitive to water stress during panicle initiations limiting the number of grains and panicle size severe water stress at i flowering stage may reduce pollination ii early grain filling may reduce individual grain weight and iii severe stress at late grain filling could lead to early senescence wani et al 2012 the relationship between irrigation and simulated maize yield is presented in fig 3c the simulated maize yield increased with irrigation up to certain level depending on the growing season precipitation the highest and lowest maize yields in our study were 13 2 and 1 06 mg ha respectively which corresponded to net irrigation application of 600 mm under 5 mm day ic and rainfed no irrigation condition respectively table 4 fig 3c fig 4 however the relationship between irrigation and observed maize yield in the same site was found to be curvilinear klocke et al 2014 the disparity might be caused by fewer simulation scenarios in our study schneekloth et al 2012 reported that maize under higher ic targeting mainly the mid season stage could improve yield rudnick et al 2017 suggested various deficit irrigation strategies to meet the potential water demand of the crop at most sensitive stages the same authors concluded that maize is very sensitive to water stress from flowering to grain filling for example severe water stress during tasseling and ear formation could result in a reduction of yield by 66 93 cakir 2004 payero et al 2006 reported that water stress can have multiple impacts such as shortening of maturity reduced canopy growth reduced root development and reduced yield in addition stress before or at the time of silking can reduce the number of kernels and stress at the time of silking or afterwards can reduce kernel weight payero et al 2006 in this study it was found that maize yield could be improved with deficit irrigation targeting critical stages but could still be significantly lower than that with full irrigation 3 2 effects of irrigation capacity the relationships between yield and ic for winter wheat grain sorghum and maize is presented in figs 4 both winter wheat and grain sorghum perform well under lower 1 7 2 5 mm day ics at which yield was peaked almost flat likewise araya et al 2018 reported that grain sorghum yield could be stabilized at ic of about 2 5 mm day in contrast maize yield significantly increased with increased ic up to 5 mm day fig 4 maize yield substantially improved under ic of 5 mm day with irrigation water application 300 mm targeting only the sensitive stages whereas yield under deficit irrigation 300 mm with an ic of 2 5 mm day resulted in significantly lower yield the relationship between maize yield and ic was linear r2 0 90 fig 4 lamm 2004 reported that the relationship between ic and maize yield was polynomial this difference may be caused by the relatively limited ranges of ic 0 2 5 and 5 mm day used to evaluate the relationship between yield and ic in this study fig 4 producers with lower ic should consider maximizing yield from a relatively smaller area so that they could meet the potential water need of the crop with higher ic while reducing their production costs lamm et al 2007 found a minimum ic of 6 mm day to meet the potential water requirement of maize with application efficiency of 95 for northwestern kansas alternatively producers with lower ic could also maximize yield and increase total production from total area by growing grain sorghum with limited irrigation 100 mm water targeting sensitive stages only 3 3 yield and crop water use et there was weak linear relationship between winter wheat yield and et r2 0 3 fig 5 a the rate of et increase did not result in proportional yield increase fig 5a because evaporation and nutrient losses may increase with irrigation sensitivity analysis indicated winter wheat seems to respond more to n application if water is available in adequate quantity not shown other studies also showed that n application in the great plains was below the n demand for potential production when compared to the n rate used in other countries lollato et al 2017 zhang and oweis 1999 reported a linear relationship between yield and et for wheat difference in the yield et response models might be caused due to climatic effect climate affects the evaporative demand of the atmosphere or difference in n uptake availability for example non productive soil evaporation was reported to reach up to 60 of the seasonal et in some areas of the mediterranean where crop growth is slow early in the growing season oweis et al 2000 such conditions could affect the rate of change in yield in relation to et in this study wheat crop et ranged on an average from 331 mm for rainfed to 533 mm for fully irrigated with a yield of 3 9 and 5 8 mg ha respectively table 2 there was linear relationship between grain sorghum yield and et fig 5b the et for grain sorghum ranged from 336 mm for rainfed to 469 mm for fully irrigated table 3 fig 5b these et values are partially in agreement with the range reported by klocke et al 2012 for southwestern kansas and by tolk and howell 2003 for the texas high plains the least irrigated grain sorghum in our study consumed 77 of the et demand to produce 91 of the yield relative to the optimally irrigated scenario this agrees with klocke et al 2012 who reported that grain sorghum grown under the least irrigated driest treatment consumed about of 87 of the et demand to produce 91 of the yield relative to the fully irrigated condition in this study simulated maize et varied with ic the lowest and highest et were simulated under ic of 0 mm day 254 mm and 5 mm day 781 mm respectively however at optimum irrigation simulated et ranged from 660 to 700 mm table 4 which is partially in agreement with araya et al 2017b in contrast under moderate ic 2 5 mm day simulated maize et ranged from 545 to 580 mm there was a linear relationship between et and yield with a r2 of 0 78 figs 5c payero et al 2006 also reported a strong linear relationship between yield and et overall maize was found to be very responsive to irrigation water and its yield was improved with the increase in et 3 4 crop water productivity cwp the lowest cwp for winter wheat was found to be 9 8 kg ha mm in the case of the highest irrigated wheat 523 mm while the highest cwp 11 8 kg ha mm corresponded to zero irrigation or the least irrigated wheat table 5 in contrast wang et al 2016 obtained an average of 1 84 kg m3 which is higher than that of wheat grown in southwest kansas because the cultivars used in that study might be more responsive to management practices such as higher seeding rate compared to this study the cwp of grain sorghum was greater than that of winter wheat and could reach up to 15 0 kg ha mm table 5 even the lowest cwp for grain sorghum 12 7 kg ha mm was slightly greater than that of the highest cwp 11 8 kg ha mm for wheat molden et al 2010 reported that c3 crops such as winter wheat is less water efficient than those c4 crops like grain sorghum in a long term 2001 2010 cropping system study schlegel et al 2012 reported that average cwp winter wheat was lower than grain sorghum and the cwp of grain sorghum was lower than that of maize the highest cwp for maize was 19 1 kg ha mm for an automatic irrigation irrigation when required followed by deficit and full irrigation strategies under ic of 5 mm day 17 18 kg ha mm these levels of maize cwps are higher than that of grain sorghum and winter wheat unlike grain sorghum maize can hardly yield without irrigation under environments with severe water deficit lower precipitation for example the average yield for rainfed maize in southwestern kansas was 1 06 mg ha which is lower than average yield of grain sorghum 4 3 mg ha in this study the lowest cwp 4 2 kg ha mm for irrigated maize corresponded to the lowest ic 0 mm day increased ic from 2 5 to 5 mm day with only 300 mm targeting sensitive growth stages could increase maize cwp from 12 7 to about 18 2 kg ha mm table 5 this shows that under high ic it is possible to meet the water demand of the most critical stages of maize even using a deficit irrigation strategy which would eventually improve cwp however payero et al 2006 indicated that using a deficit irrigation practice with the aim of improving cwp may not be a better strategy producers could be more motivated with the income they gain than the water they saved and thus profitability may be a better measure of success than crop water productivity according to molden et al 2010 improving cwp could depend on many factors that includes cost factors profitability and government incentives marketability education water policy and institutional structures 3 5 irrigation water productivity iwp the highest iwp iwp calculated as irrigated minus rainfed crop yield divided by the amount of irrigation for wheat 11 0 kg ha mm and grain sorghum 20 0 kg ha mm seem to be achievable by applying deficit irrigation of about 100 mm table 5 in contrast the lowest iwp for winter wheat and grain sorghum were 3 4 and 5 5 kg ha mm respectively the lowest iwp occurred with an ic of 5 mm day with total seasonal irrigation applications of 350 and 400 mm respectively this implies that irrigation water was efficiently utilized when winter wheat and grain sorghum were treated with lower ics 1 7 2 5 mm day in southwestern kansas with 85 90 irrigation efficiency efficiency of irrigation also depends on soil characteristics crop type response of crop and irrigation method performance and uniformity of application used irmak et al 2011 the highest iwp 28 0 kg ha mm for maize was obtained at an ic of 5 mm day with net deficit irrigation application of only 300 mm table 5 in contrast the lowest iwp 16 0 kg ha mm was obtained under net irrigation application of 400 mm with an ic of 2 5 mm day iwp values could show how efficiently the irrigation water was utilized by the crop under a given ic however when it comes to maize producers might be interested in increasing income while reducing cost studies indicated that maize requires adequate water during its growing period in order to produce high yield araya et al 2017b payero et al 2006 revealed that limited deficit irrigation may not be advantageous over full irrigation therefore for regions with lower ics growing drought tolerant crops with limited irrigation adee et al 2016 water might be advisable in terms of iwp for example high iwp 15 20 0 kg ha mm can be obtained at ic of 1 7 mm day from grain sorghum by applying 100 150 mm of irrigation water table 5 whereas for regions with higher ics 5 mm day it might be possible to obtain relatively higher iwp 23 28 0 kg ha mm by growing maize by using more irrigation water 300 450 mm than that required by grain sorghum however it might be possible to obtain greater iwp and greater total production from an extensive grain sorghum area by applying 100 mm irrigation water than from growing maize with the same amount of irrigation water 3 6 return after variable cost versus irrigation capacity the long term 1950 2013 median and average ravc for wheat grain sorghum and maize is presented in tables 6 8 the ravc for rainfed wheat and grain sorghum were superior relative to irrigated wheat and grain sorghum with ravc not increasing with irrigation for example the estimated median ravc for rainfed and irrigated wheat was at least 252 and 169 ha respectively table 6 similarly rainfed grain sorghum was more profitable than irrigated table 7 lamm et al 2007 also reported that grain sorghum is more profitable under rainfed system than irrigated in contrast maize yield and ravc increased with increase in ic other studies indicated that net income from maize could increase under higher ic when compared to those maize grown under lower ics 5 1 mm day lamm et al 2007 the current study showed that it is possible to obtain a median ravc of at least 530 ha from maize under ic of 5 mm day when compared to 16 ha under rainfed ic 0 mm day producers could obtain at least an average ravc of 281 per ha if they want to grow maize under deficit irrigation with irrigation capacity of 2 5 mm day for 1 out of 2 years this shows that a producer may get better income from fully irrigated maize over large farms and could provide some employment this study showed that winter wheat and grain sorghum could be more profitable if grown without irrigation winter wheat seems more profitable than grain sorghum since it is grown during the winter period its success is usually challenged by extreme weather events which are difficult to capture with crop models weather hazards such as frost hail and other factors could influence the productivity records showed that the seasonal production success for winter wheat in the region was less than grain sorghum for example schlegel et al 2012 reported that winter freeze and hail substantially damaged winter wheat which reduced profit when compared to maize and grain sorghum however both grain sorghum and winter wheat have the capability to grow without irrigation or with smaller number of irrigations per season when compared to maize the lower requirement on irrigation needs would reduce the pressure on the aquifer while decreasing production costs both crops can also be grown in rotation it is also possible to obtain greater total production especially from grain sorghum under rainfed production system which makes it very suitable crop for producer with limited irrigation capacity than many other crops this ability of grain sorghum to produce greater yield from total area under rainfed condition allows growers to supply feed to their animals throughout the year while sustainably maintaining the environment future employment and food security in the region it is also possible to optimize winter wheat and grain sorghum yield with irrigation of about 100 150 mm and 100 250 mm respectively which is by far lower than the optimal irrigation requirements for maize 450 mm however the income gained per given area from winter wheat or grain sorghum was almost less than 50 of that income gained from fully irrigated maize in contrast it is less likely to grow maize under rainfed condition as documented in this modeling analysis maize could be more profitable if grown under full than deficit irrigation in addition the income improved as irrigation water increased due to the increase in maize yield however the aquifer is facing pressure whereby producers are withdrawing groundwater for irrigation with little or no recharge this would make the future employment uncertain as cities and industries in the region also depend on this water income and employment opportunities from growing maize may not last longer than 25 years from now depending on the production location within ogallala aquifer region this would mean the short term profitability and employment opportunities need to be compared with the long term environmental impact and food security 4 conclusions winter wheat and grain sorghum could do best under lower ics of 1 7 and 1 7 2 5 mm day respectively whereas maize could grow best at minimum ic of 5 mm day winter wheat and grain sorghum can be optimized with an average deficit irrigation of 100 150 and 100 250 mm respectively whereas maize requires about 450 mm the average cwp for irrigated winter wheat grain sorghum and maize ranged between 9 8 and 11 8 12 8 and 15 0 and 4 2 and 19 1 kg ha mm respectively the iwp for the respective crops ranged 3 4 11 0 5 5 to 20 0 and 16 28 0 kg ha mm respectively this study showed if maize is grown under full irrigation ic 5 mm day it could generate an average net return after variable cost of 534 ha for 1 out of 2 years however growing winter wheat and grain sorghum under irrigation was less profitable 180 194 per ha for winter wheat and 105 109 per ha for grain sorghum winter wheat and grain sorghum could be grown without irrigation generating a net return after variable cost of at least 242 and 188 ha for 1 out of 2 years respectively this study was conducted with the assumption that the selected crop varieties together with the most common management practices and estimated costs presented in enterprise report might give some indicators of effect of ic on iwp cwp and return after variable cost for three major crops winter wheat grain sorghum and maize in the southwestern kansas the approaches used in this work might be useful for guiding producer s decision in optimizing resources and selecting crops and cropping systems based on economic and water use efficiency

corresponding author at no 23 weihui road yangling shaanxi province 712100 china no 23 weihui road yangling shaanxi province 712100 china soil infiltration and manning s roughness values are key parameters to determine the performance of surface irrigation however temporal variability in these parameters due to tillage practices irrigation and crop growth greatly hinders efforts to improve irrigation quality the objective of this experiment was to evaluate effects of infiltration and surface roughness variation on irrigation water movement and irrigation performance indicators for border irrigation with three border lengths field experiments were conducted from 2013 to 2015 in a wheat triticum aestivum maize zea mays l rotation planting system at the jinghui canal irrigation area in guanzhong plain of northwest china in this work manning s equation and a surface irrigation simulation model winsrfr were used to estimate manning s roughness values and kostiakov soil infiltration parameters we determined that both parameters reached moderate levels of variation for both deep and shallow tillage treatments the impacts of temporal variation in soil infiltration and surface roughness on irrigation water movement and irrigation quality were then evaluated results showed that water advance times varied significantly while recession times varied much more affecting irrigation water amounts at various distances along the length of the border irrigation performance indicators were significantly different over various irrigation seasons especially for borders that were 235 m in length finally considering these temporal variations during the two rotation cycles combinations of inflow rate and cut off ratio during different irrigation seasons were optimized and high irrigation quality could be achieved for 80 m and 120 m borders but not for 235 m borders water percolation amounts during the 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 growing periods were reduced by 55 mm and 107 mm for 235 m borders 26 mm and 23 mm for 120 m borders and 36 mm and 39 mm for 80 m borders respectively therefore utilizing optimal combinations of inflow rate and cut off ratio and considering temporal variation in soil infiltration and manning s roughness could maintain high water application efficiency and sustainable utilization of limited water resources keywords soil infiltration parameters manning s roughness temporal variation irrigation performance 1 introduction the jinhui canal irrigation area is directly supplied with water from the jinghe river this area is located on the guanzhong plain in xianyang shaanxi province china in this region annual average rainfall is 550 mm potential evapotranspiration is high li et al 2013 and the main irrigation method is traditional surface irrigation because of the relatively low precipitation and high evaportranspiraton irrigation is necessary to maintain sustainable crop production surface irrigation is the oldest and most common irrigation method throughout the world even though it traditionally suffers from many problems such as low water application efficiency and low uniformity gillies and smith 2005 the main grain crops planted in the jinhui canal irrigation area are wheat and maize liu and zhu 2011 zhang et al 2016 however because of differences in crops grown weather conditions and tillage practices irrigation performance varies significantly across the region creating major problems in determining best management practices that will result in high water use efficiency in irrigated areas soil water infiltration is one of the most important processes affecting the volume transport route and water quality of agricultural drainage berehe et al 2013 and is a key parameter in surface irrigation models bautista and schlegel 2017 waller and yitayew 2016 soil infiltration determines the speed and distribution with which irrigation water or rain water seeps into the soil the soil infiltration capacity is one of the basic indicators used to determine irrigation technical parameters oyonarte et al 2002 zerihun et al 1996 furthermore soil infiltration is the second most important factor affecting border irrigation quality with inflow rate being the most important factor maheshwari et al 1988 a commonly used infiltration equation is the kostiakov equation walker et al 2006 walker and skogerboe 1987 soil infiltration characteristics are determined by a multitude of factors including soil texture soil structure soil water content and soil organic matter franzluebbers 2002 gillies et al 2011 li and fan 2006 zheng and fan 2000 tillage practices cause soil structure disruption but are essential farming practices that farmers use to influence soil and microclimate to maximize agricultural yield berehe et al 2013 because of tillage soil physical and chemical properties change during rotation cycles soil bulk density and soil moisture content in the cultivation layer experience temporal variability both of which influence the temporal variability of soil infiltration characteristics manning s roughness coefficient represents the effect of combined resistant forces which act opposite to the direction of flow mailapalli et al 2008 affecting irrigation water movement and irrigation quality there are many factors affecting roughness including soil texture surface roughness crop density and growth harun ur rashid 1990 valiantzas 1994 li and bing 2008 analyzed field roughness coefficients for different soil surface conditions mailapalli et al 2008 reported variation in manning s roughness coefficient for bare and cropped fields under furrow irrigation over the entire wheat maize crop rotation period the temporal variation of manning s roughness coefficient with border irrigation was not clear irrigation performance is used to describe the hydraulic performance or the ability to apply water efficiently and uniformly to the field gillies 2008 the performance of border irrigation systems depends on border dimensions border slope inflow rate cut off time manning s roughness coefficient and soil infiltration properties pereira et al 2002 reasonable optimization of irrigation technical parameters has been an important topic of long term studies smith et al 2005 zerihun et al 1997 researchers have worked to improve border irrigation performance optimizing border dimensions anwar et al 2016 miao et al 2015 inflow rates and cut off times morris et al 2015 salahou et al 2018 researchers have improved border irrigation performance by considering soil spatial variability bai et al 2017 2010 li et al 2001 nie et al 2014 wang et al 2009 however these studies rarely involved impacts of temporal variation in these parameters on irrigation water movement and irrigation performance during the different irrigation seasons within plant rotation cycles at the field scale the temporal variations of soil infiltration and manning s roughness are usually significant and thus significantly affect irrigation water movement and water quality assessing the variation of soil infiltration and manning s roughness values and related impacts on irrigation performance is therefore required to evaluate possible water savings in order to improve irrigation quality by taking into account thetemporal variation of soil infiltration parameters and manning s roughness coefficient a field study was conducted in the jinghui canal irrigation area with the following objectives 1 to estimate soil kostiakov infiltration parameters and manning s roughness coefficient and analyze their temporal variation 2 to evaluate the trajectory of irrigation water advance and recession and the performance of border irrigation when considering temporal variation in infiltration parameter k and manning s roughness 3 to establish different scenarios incorporating different values of infiltration parameter k and manning s roughness to assess the sensitivity ranges of these variables on irrigation performance and 4 to determine the optimal combination of inflow rate and cut off ratio during different irrigation seasons considering temporal variation in infiltration and surface roughness in order to maximize irrigation water application efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment the experiments were conducted at qiaodi 34 35 n 108 43 e located in the upper zone of the jinghui canal irrigation area 34 25 20 to 34 41 40 n 108 34 34 to 109 21 35 e from 2013 to 2015 the site is located in a semiarid to sub humid climate zone the soil type is lou soil with silty loam texture 22 7 clay 48 0 silt 29 3 sand the field capacity and wilting point are about 23 5 and 10 6 soil mass water content respectively and groundwater is at least 30 m below the surface fig 1 shows monthly cumulative solar radiation and cumulative precipitation in the jinghui canal irrigation area from 2013 to 2015 the main crop planting practice is a wheat maize rotation with summer maize cultivar wuke 2 grown during june to october and winter wheat cultivar xinong 979 grown from october to the next june the experiment was designed with different length borders of 80 m 120 m and 235 m with closed ends table 1 usually before sowing wheat farmers in this region till fields to varying depths 15 30 cm we therefore used deep tillage about 30 cm in the first year 2013 2014 and shallow tillage about 15 cm in the second year 2014 2015 prior to wheat sowing in each year irrigation events were conducted during the 2013 2015 irrigation seasons according to local farmers experience with the target irrigation depth of 90 mm per irrigation the usual depth of irrigation applied in the guanzhong plain region data collected for irrigation events five irrigation events during the 2013 2014 period and six during the 2014 2015 period and nine borders every length included three borders included inflow rate irrigation time cut off ratio flow depth at the start of the border for estimating manning s roughness water advance and recession times for estimating infiltration soil bulk density before irrigation and soil water content before and after irrigation inflow rate is an essential parameter for evaluating irrigation performance and we planned to consistently control the unit width discharge however we maintained inflow rate between 12 5 and 13 5 l m 1 s 1 measured with a hydrometric propeller because of the uncertainty in practice this was a reasonable inflow rate for the local conditions the cut off ratio was set as 0 7 for the 80 m and 120 m length borders and 0 8 for the 235 m length borders water depth at the start of the border for estimating manning s roughness was measured using a ruler fixed in place before irrigation the advance and recession times of water were measured every 10 m in the longitudinal direction of the border along which we placed stakes every 10 m soil bulk density was measured with 10 cm soil layers down to 30 cm at the head middle and tail of borders before every irrigation event furthermore to calculate the infiltration depth and irrigation performance indicators we measured gravimetric soil water content prior to and after each irrigation using the oven drying method with 10 cm soil layers down to 100 cm and 20 cm layers from 100 to 200 cm every 10 m in the longitudinal direction of the borders 2 2 data analysis 2 2 1 soil infiltration and manning s roughness the hydraulic roughness coefficient is expressed often in terms of manning s roughness coefficient n which was computed

depth at the start of the border m and q is the unit width discharge l s 1 m 1 however there exist some weaknesses in using the manning equation to calculate resistance from our assumption that the irrigation flow is uniform difficult to maintain because water infiltrates along the field meanwhile s in eq 1 is difficult to measure and therefore we approximate the slope of the energy line with the slope of the water surface which is the same as slope of the border only if flow is uniform however we can assume that flow depths rise rapidly and attain near normal depth in a short time under the condition that the field slopes used for this experiment were close to 0 004 thus we could assume that depths will be close to normal for whatever flow rate is at a given distance in this experiment that approximation is reasonable because the field slope is essentially at the point where we can consider the flow kinematic the soil infiltration model used the two parameter kostiakov infiltration equation morris et al 2015 smith et al 2005 one of the most commonly used empirical functions for surface irrigation 2 i k t α where i is the cumulative depth of infiltration mm k is the fitted coefficient parameter mm h 1 α is the fitted exponent parameter and t is the infiltration time the infiltration parameter values were obtained using inverse model simulation with the hydraulic surface irrigation simulation model winsrfr4 1 bautista et al 2009a b this model s event analysis module includes two methods the merriam keller post irrigation volume balance analysis relying on water advance and water recession data and the elliot walker two point method analysis relying on two points of water advance data we chose the merriam keller post irrigation volume balance analysis first we put water advance and recession time data coupled with the manning s roughness value into the winsrfr model the initial value was set for α the k value was estimated by the winsrfr model and then we compared simulated water advance and recession curves with observed curves until a good fit between the two curves was achieved producing values of the kostiakov infiltration parameters k and α 2 2 2 irrigation performance indicators infiltration water depth wd mm along the border was calculated by observations of soil water content before and after every irrigation 3 w d i 1 15 θ i 1 θ i 0 h i where θi1 and θi0 are the soil volume water content after and before irrigation of the i soil layer respectively hi is soil depth of the i soil layer the indicators that were used in this study to evaluate the performance of closed end border irrigation were application efficiency ae requirement efficiency re distribution uniformity dulq and deep percolation average depth of water drained beyond the root zone dp mm burt et al 1997 these indicators were defined as follows 4 a e v o l u m e o f w a t e r a d d e d t o t h e r o o t z o n e t o t a l v o l u m e o f w a t e r a p p l i e

s n infiltration parameters water advance and recession times and infiltration volumes by using spss statistics 22 0 statistically significant comparisons were identified using least significant difference lsd tests correlation analysis was conducted based on the assumption that there exists a relationship between bulk density water content and infiltration parameters 2 3 sensitivity analyses and optimization of border irrigation to reveal the effect of these temporal variation factors manning s roughness and infiltration parameter k on the irrigation performance indicators sensitivity analysis with winsrfr4 1 software was conducted infiltration k values ranging from 100 to 200 mm h 1 and manning s roughness ranging from 0 04 to 0 22 were tested when sensitivity analysis for manning s roughness was performed average values of infiltration k and α were held constant when sensitivity analysis for infiltration k was performed the average value of manning s roughness was held constant for actual field irrigation areas border length and slope cannot be changed randomly and soil infiltration characteristics and roughness coefficient cannot be altered manually however optimum inflow rate and cut off ratio cut off time can be determined and controlled therefore we used the winsrfr4 1 model to continuously optimize the inflow rate and cut off ratio until the irrigation performance indicators were maximized our goal was for all irrigation performance indicator values to be over 80 and to minimize deep percolation 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal variation of infiltration and roughness 3 1 1 temporal variation of roughness temporal variation of manning s roughness coefficient for the irrigation events in the maize wheat rotation system existed in the jinghui canal irrigation area table 2 manning s roughness coefficient varied from 0 071 to 0 212 in the first rotation year and from 0 063 to 0 187 in the second rotation year for which the coefficient of variation cv values were 0 487 and 0 417 respectively mailapalli et al 2008 reported the temporal variation of manning s roughness coefficient for both bare and cropped furrow conditions decreased with elapsed time the greater variation of manning s roughness coefficient compared with their result may be due to crop variety and growth sepaskhah and bondar 2002 found that vegetation cover had the greatest effect on manning s roughness coefficient causing the value of manning s roughness coefficient to be increased three times for 100 vegetation cover gilley and kottwitz 1994 reported that resistance values may be minimal at the beginning of the cropping season and increase substantially by the time of crop maturity this result was consistent with our research that manning s roughness coefficient was significantly different p 0 05 in different irrigation seasons table 2 during the initial stage of the winter wheat growth period the borders were almost bare which caused little waterflow resistance at the next irrigation event wheat leaf area and canopy cover had developed causing an increase in the drag force of water most likely the variation in manning s roughness coefficient increased rapidly in early april due to increased wheat growth at the later irrigation event resulting in increased turbulence intensity causing additional loss of energy and flow retardance sepaskhah and bondar 2002 during the early part of the maize growth period manning s roughness coefficient was 0 09 greater than the 0 07 value found initially for wheat possibly due to the residue left by the wheat which generated little drag force for water flow however in the later irrigation manning s roughness coefficient was almost unchanged with the increased growth of maize table 2 this is probably because of the greater spacing between maize plants compared with spacing between wheat plants and the consequent lesser resistance to water movement these results were in accordance with the results of gilley and kottwitz 1994 who reported that wheat roughness coefficient ranged from 0 11 to 0 27 while maize roughness coefficient ranged from 0 0018 to 0 0810 the results were similar in the second year what is particularly noteworthy is that manning s roughness coefficient was only slightly p 0 05 decreased at the third irrigation event 20 august 2015 from its value at the second irrigation event 20 july 2015 during the maize growth period table 2 most likely this is because the surface of border irrigation areas became smoother due to decomposition of wheat residue during the later maize growth period in conclusion the influence of deep or shallow tillage on manning s roughness values was not significant p 0 05 while plant species plant growth and previous residue amount and type were the main factors resulting in temporal variation of manning s roughness table 2 3 1 2 temporal variation of soil infiltration there was a considerable change of kostiakov infiltration parameters at different irrigation dates for the wheat maize rotation system table 2 k values varied from 120 to 196 mm h 1 in the first rotation year and from 114 to 175 mm h 1 in the second rotation year during which the cv values were 0 176 and 0 151 respectively the degree of temporal variation of the soil infiltration k value in both wheat maize rotation cycles reached a moderate level 0 1 cv 1 temporal variability in infiltration can be attributed to soil structure soil bulk density and soil moisture content table 3 infiltration k was negatively influenced by soil bulk density slightly p 0 05 and soil water content p 0 05 while infiltration α was negatively influenced by soil bulk density p 0 05 and positively influenced by soil water content slightly p 0 05 these results agreed with the results of li et al 2009 in early october before wheat was planted the borders were tilled deep 30 cm which altered soil structure causing the soil to become loose soil bulk density was reduced to 1 15 g cm 3 fig 2 the lowest value of the year and the water content was lower before the first irrigation during the wheat growth period at this time the soil had larger internal pores higher connectivity and lower resistance to the movement of infiltration water characterized by an increase in soil water infiltration coefficient k to 190 mm h 1 at the first irrigation event table 2 after the compaction effect of the first irrigation and a subsequent rainfall event fig 1a soil bulk density increased considerably 17 to 1 35 g cm 3 at the next irrigation event fig 2 meanwhile water content was about 19 in order to ensure that the winter wheat could survive the winter the second irrigation event was carried out at this time soil compactness increased porosity decreased and pore connectivity decreased all of which generated greater resistance to the movement of infiltration water coupled to higher soil bulk density and moisture content thus the kostiakov infiltration k value decreased significantly p 0 05 to 120 mm h 1 table 2 in early april soil bulk density decreased slightly to 1 32 g cm 3 probably due to loose soil caused by alternation of soil freezing and thawing plants developed rapidly during this period consuming a large quantity of water and reducing soil moisture content to 15 7 moreover wheat roots that were developing in early april created channels in the soil profile that eventually led to quicker passage of water eventually the kostiakov infiltration k value increased sharply p 0 05 to 181 mm h 1 table 2 then soil bulk density increased to 1 38 g cm 3 during the early stages of maize growth fig 2 before the first irrigation event was applied in order to ensure maize seedling emergence this increase in bulk densidty was probably due to soil compaction following a long period of continuous rain fig 1b resulting in a slight decrease p 0 05 in the kostiakov infiltration k value compared with the last irrigation table 2 before the second irrigation of maize soil structure was relatively stable and soil bulk density changed only slightly however soil evaporation and plant transpiration were great during this period of low precipitation resulting in lower soil moisture content 16 1 fig 2 at the same time many cracks appeared in the soil surface of the borders due to low precipitation and the dry surface soil condition eventually the kostiakov infiltration k value increased significantly p 0 05 to 195 mm h 1 when the second irrigation event was carried out during the second wheat maize rotation cycle the borders received shallow tillage 15 cm before wheat was planted causing soil bulk density to increase to 1 25 g cm 3 more than in the initial wheat phase of the first wheat maize rotation cycle the kostiakov infiltration parameter α values in the two year rotation cycles varied from 0 451 to 0 643 in the first year and from 0 469 to 0 556 in the second year table 2 for which the cv values were 0 159 and 0 062 respectively furman et al 2006 suggested that there was no reason to treat the exponent of an infiltration power law as a variable quantity and suggested using a value of 0 45 however soil structure is periodically disturbed and destroyed due to cultivation irrigation and rainfall likely causing varied values of α table 2 before wheat was planted in early october of the first year of the study the borders were tilled deep followed by shallow tillage in the second year which likely explains why temporal variation in α values in the first year was much greater p 0 05 than in the second year 3 2 temporal variability in the trajectory of water advance and recession fig 3 shows the water advance and recession trajectory curves relative to different length borders and various irrigation seasons advance time depends on manning s roughness influencing the resistance value and the infiltration k value influencing driving forces in the process of water advance advance curves varied over time in the various irrigation seasons for all border lengths and recession curves varied much more water advance time varied from 10 8 min to 21 7 min for 80 m borders 19 9 min to 44 1 min for 120 m borders and 49 6 min to 87 2 min for 235 m borders during the 2013 2014 rotation cycle irrigation events on 20 oct 2013 and 11 jan 2014 produced the highest advance rate and were not significantly different p 0 05 table 4 due to lower manning s roughness and lower infiltration parameter k table 2 in contrast the lowest advance rate 21 7 min appeared on 2 apr 2014 due to the highest manning s roughness value which characterized the greater resistance to water advance and high infiltration parameter k that reduced part of the driving force table 2 there was no significant difference p 0 05 between the two irrigation events during maize growth probably due to only slightly different manning s roughness value and infiltration parameter k table 2 with shallow tillage during 2014 2015 the range of temporal variation of water advance time values was greatly reduced showing lower cv values than during 2014 2015 table 4 with water advance times ranging from 12 1 min to 17 2 min for 80 m borders 15 7 min to 29 4 min for 120 m borders and 41 0 min to 69 3 min for 235 m borders recession time depends on how the infiltration k value is influenced by the water infiltration rate and the irrigation time which ultimately determine the irrigation water volume affecting the infiltration duration time from the recession curves fig 3 we observed that recession time varied from 25 min to 98 min for 80 m borders 41 3 min to 88 3 min for 120 m borders and 71 7 min to 238 0 min for 235 m borders during the first rotation cycle similarly long water recession times were observed at both the head and tail of borders on 2 apr 2014 significantly different p 0 05 from other recession times at the other irrigation events table 4 during 2013 2014 during 2013 2014 we observed lower variation lower cv at the head of the borders than at the tail of the borders and this was especially true for the 80 m and 120 m length borders during 2014 2015 this may be due to the fact that less advance time variation led to the lower recession time variation at the head of borders but the same cut off ratio value for various irrigation seasons resulted in significant differences p 0 05 in water at the tail of the borders at different irrigation seasons especially during wheat growth table 4 causing higher variation at the tail of the borders during the second year 3 3 analysis of irrigation performance advance and recession times determine opportunity times along the field and ultimately infiltrated water and irrigation performance the infiltrated water depth along the border under the temporal variation of infiltration parameters and manning roughness was compared in fig 4 the measured values of infiltrated water depth along different border lengths in different irrigation seasons were variable and non uniform in spatial temporal distribution especially for water depth on 2 apr 2014 that was significantly different p 0 05 from others fig 4a1 b1 c1 it is worth mentioning that water at the tail of all of the borders was significantly different with respect to the temporal variation which showed water accumulating at the tail of the borders and infiltrating deeper during some irrigation events e g 11 mar 2015 whereas for other irrigation events infiltration was inadequate fig 4 in response to the shallow tillage during the 2014 2015 rotation cycle differences in water distribution along the borders were lower than during the first year when deep tillage was employed except at the tail of the borders variation in applied irrigation amount affecting irrigation performance was mainly caused by variation in infiltration and roughness coefficient under the same inflow rate and cut off distance table 5 applied irrigation amount during the wheat growth period of turning green to elongation 2 apr 2014 11 mar 2015 was much greater than at other irrigation dates due to greater infiltration parameters and manning s roughness which is quite different from the applied irrigation amount to wheat during earlier growth stages during the maize production period we found no significant difference p 0 05 in irrigation amounts applied among the irrigation events mainly due to no significant differences p 0 05 in infiltration parameters and manning s roughness tables 2 and 4 there were two irrigation events 20 oct 2013 11 jan 2014 where the applied irrigation amount was significantly less p 0 05 than at other irrigation dates and less than the target water depth of 90 mm also there was one irrigation event 2 apr 2014 where the irrigation application amount was far greater than at other dates for 80 m length borders in the first year three irrigation events applied irrigation amounts that were far greater than 90 mm except for two satisfactory irrigation events 20 oct 2013 11 jan 2014 for the 120 m length borders irrigation application amounts for all of the irrigation events with the 235 mm borders were far greater than 90 mm the irrigation performance indicators were estimated for an application depth of 90 mm all three parameters showed variation due to temporal variation in the infiltration parameter and manning s roughness fig 5 we observed that lower values of ae 69 for 80 m 58 for 120 m and 42 for 235 m borders during 2013 2014 82 for 80 m 74 for 120 m and 54 for 235 m during 2014 2015 appeared on 2 apr 2014 and 11 mar 2015 respectively the dates with larger infiltration parameter and manning s roughness values that resulted in much deeper percolation of water along the borders table 5 lower dulq values are generally attributed to the condition of insufficient water stored in the root zone and a large amount of water at the tail of the border as occurred on 11 jan 2014 14 jan 2015 and 11 mar 2015 for the 80 m border water at the tail of the border is a major component of the amount of deep percolation water and occurs when the infiltration parameter value is low causing a rapid flow rate and large amounts of water to accumulate in the tail on 20 oct 2013 and 10 jun 2015 for the 235 m border a large amount of water was stored in the root zone and there was little water in the tail of the border mainly owing to the longer borders and larger infiltration parameters which led to less water in the border s tail and more water distributed in other part of the borders fig 4 similarly lower re values on 3 nov 2014 73 for 80 m border and 75 for 120 m border were due to insufficient water stored in the root zone caused by lower infiltration parameter values and small manning s roughness value in addition we found that ae values were reduced when borders were too long the ae values were all lower than 80 for the 235 m borders leading to large volumes of wasted water meanwhile we found that the total amount of water that percolated deeply increased with increasing border length table 5 this result suggests that border length should be determined in order to adjust infiltration time such that the required water depth can be obtained comparing cv values of ae 0 19 235 m 0 15 120 m 0 10 80 m dulq 0 12 80 m 0 08 235 m 0 04 120 m and re 0 12 80 m 0 08 120 m 0 01 235 m we found that the most sensitive irrigation performance indicators due to the variation of infiltration parameters and roughness were du and re for 80 m borders and ae for 235 m borders 3 4 sensitivity analysis of temporal variation factors the results of the analyses of irrigation performance indicators for sensitivity to manning s roughness and infiltration parameter k are shown in fig 6 for different length borders in general these temporal variability factors have different effects on irrigation performance indicators due to different length borders these results indicated that re increased as the manning s roughness increased from 0 04 to 0 22 for all border lengths and ae decreased with increasing manning s roughness for all border lengths fig 6 a1 a3 when manning s roughness is lower the velocity of water flow is faster which leads to the lower amounts of infiltration water stored in the root layer thus larger ae values and smaller re values as the water flow rate decreases due to larger manning s roughness more and more water is stored in the root system however water advance momentum would still exist resulting in more water in the tail of the border a larger re value and a smaller ae value however for larger values of manning s roughness more than 0 14 for 80 m more than 0 10 for 120 m and more than 0 06 for 235 m length borders the re values were less sensitive to changes in manning s roughness but ae values were more sensitive dulq values slightly decreased as the manning s roughness increased for 80 m borders but slightly increased for 120 m and 235 m borders for 80 m borders at a 0 7 cut off ratio the water at the tail of the borders a factor that affects du values changes from a moderate amount to an excessive amount as manning s roughness increases but for 120 m and 235 m borders the water in the tail of the border changes from an insufficient amount to a moderate amount and then to an excessive amount which leads to the different trends of dulq for different border lengths dulq values were somewhat sensitive to any change in manning s roughness with 80 m borders in contrast dulq values were more sensitive to changes in manning s roughness for both 120 m and 235 m borders if values were less than 0 10 furthermore when values of all irrigation performance indicators were greater than 80 the values of manning s roughness ranged from 0 08 to 0 16 for 80 m borders and from 0 08 0 12 for 120 m borders for the 235 m borders ae values were lower than 80 for manning s roughness values from 0 04 0 22 fig 6 b1 b2 shows the results of the sensitivity analyses over a range of values of the infiltration parameter k from 100 200 mm h 1 for the 80 m and 120 m borders values of all three irrigation performance indicators ae dulq re were sensitive to changes in k and first increased and then decreased with the increase of k values for 80 m and 120 m borders high values of performance indicators 80 were obtained for infiltration parameter k values ranging from 150 200 mm h 1 and 120 180 mm h 1 respectively as k values reached a certain threshold range the velocity of water flow slows down more and more water is stored in the root zone along the length of the borders the ratio of water accumulated at the tail of the borders is lower and distribution of infiltrated water along the borders is more and more uniform resulting in high ae dulq and re values once k values were higher than 150 mm h 1 for 120 m borders more water accumulated and infiltrated deeper into soil at the front part of the borders than it did at the tail of borders where no irrigation water reached resulting in lower ae dulq and re values furthermore results from fig 6 b1 b2 indicated that values of all irrigation performance indicators for 120 m borders were more sensitive to change than for 80 m borders if k values were more than 150 mm h 1 for 235 m borders re values were not sensitive to changes in k as irrigation water was far below the root zone the sensitivity trend for dulq values was the same with 80 m and 120 m borders the ae values were more sensitive to change because more and more irrigation water infiltrated deep with the increase of k value 3 5 optimization of border irrigation unreasonable irrigation water flow and cut off ratio cut off time due to temporal variation of infiltration parameter k value and manning s roughness resulted in significant differences p 0 05 in irrigation quality during different irrigation seasons therefore it is necessary to optimize the combination of irrigation technology parameters inflow rate and cut off ratio in different irrigation seasons to minimize discrepancies in irrigation performance following recommendations from the united states department of agriculture and given the actual practices used in the experimental irrigation area we estimated the applicable ranges of unit width discharge q and cut off ratio cr as 4 l s 1 m 1 q 15 l s 1 m 1 and 0 5 cr 1 0 the results are listed in table 6 although we tried to optimize inflow rate and cut off ratio it is clear from table 6 that we generally did not obtain higher irrigation quality for 235 m borders except for the second irrigation event due to a low value of the infiltration parameter k at this time more advance time occurs with 235 m borders causing large volumes of water to infiltrate deep into the soil root zone which produced ae values that were as low as 49 71 even though values of other performance indicators were higher table 6 the total amounts of water percolated for 235 m borders were 266 mm and 185 mm during the two rotation cycles respectively while these are extreme values of drainage loss even though these values were reduced by 55 mm and 107 mm respectively compared with the irrigation events before optimization tables 5 and 6 for the 120 m borders all indicator values were higher than 80 except for the third irrigation event on 2 april 2014 due to larger values of infiltration k and manning s roughness values the total amounts of water percolated with optimization were 85 mm and 29 mm during the two rotation years respectively which were reduced by 26 mm and 23 mm tables 5 and 6 here the optimized unit width discharges for borders ranged between 6 15 l s 1 m 1 during the period of a rotation cycle for 80 m borders all values of the irrigation performance indicators were greater than 80 after optimization similarly the total amounts of water percolated during the two rotation years 30 mm and 2 mm were reduced by 36 mm and 39 mm tables 5 and 6 respectively here the optimized unit width discharges for borders ranged between 4 15 l s 1 m 1 during the period of a rotation cycle furthermore it is clear that the optimized unit width discharges were increased with the increase of border length table 6 farmers should increase the inflows and reduce the cut off ratio to prevent excess water from accumulating at the tail of borders with the increase of infiltration k and manning s roughness coefficient values 4 conclusions to maintain high irrigation water application efficiency and sustainable use of limited water resources for a specific area evaluation and optimization of irrigation performance in different irrigation seasons should consider temporal variations of infiltration parameter and manning s roughness in this study manning s roughness coefficient and soil kostiakov infiltration parameters in different irrigation seasons were estimated using manning s equation and the winsrfr model to analyze the degree of temporal variation water advance and recession curves and irrigation performance indicators were evaluated considering temporal variation combinations of inflow rate and cut off ratio in different irrigation seasons were optimized to increase irrigation quality performance indicators the following conclusions were drawn from the results 1 manning s roughness values ranged from 0 07 to 0 2 in different irrigation seasons during the 2013 2014 rotation cycle with deep tillage and ranged from 0 063 to 0 187 during 2014 2015 with shallow tillage which implied that manning s roughness values were mainly affected by crop growth kostiakov infiltration parameters were mainly affected by soil bulk density and water content especially the k value which had average values ranging from 120 to 195 mm h 1 during the 2013 2014 rotation cycle and ranging from 114 to 175 mm h 1 during the 2014 2015 rotation cycle temporal variation of manning s roughness values and k values reached a moderate degree 0 1 cv 1 2 the impact of the soil infiltration and manning s roughness variability on water advance and recession curves was non negligible for various border lengths water advance times had slightly significant variation while recession times varied more significantly the difference was more pronounced for the 235 m borders for both shallow tillage and deep tillage treatments the temporal variations of water advance and recession times were slightly different affecting irrigation water amount at various distances along the length of the borders thus affecting the irrigation performance indicators 3 there were only a few irrigation events where all values of irrigation performance indicators reached 80 during the two rotation cycles due to temporal variation of soil infiltration and manning s roughness the most sensitive irrigation performance indicators differed with the different border lengths with du and re being most sensitive for 80 m borders and ae being the most sensitive performance indicator for 235 m borders 4 the sensitivity analysis showed that re values increased gradually with the increase of manning s roughness coefficient while ae values exhibited the opposite trend the dulq values varied with the length of the borders under the local irrigation conditions ae re and dulq were sensitive to changes in the infiltration parameter k all three performance indicators first increased and then decreased with the increasing k value except for ae and re with 235 m borders nevertheless borders of different lengths have different ranges of sensitive values for soil infiltration and manning s roughness 5 by optimizing the technical parameters of irrigation during different irrigation seasons while considering temporal variations of soil infiltration and manning s roughness high quality irrigation could be achieved for 80 m and 120 m length borders but not for 235 m borders as a result during the two rotation cycles investigated in this study the amounts of deep percolation water could be reduced by 55 mm and 107 mm for 235 m borders 26 mm and 23 mm for 120 m borders and 36 mm and 39 mm for 80 m borders therefore utilizing optimal combinations of inflow rate and cut off ratio and considering temporal variation in soil infiltration and manning s roughness could maintain high irrigation water application efficiency and sustainable utilization of limited water resources acknowledgements this study was funded by the national key research and development program of china

corresponding author at no 23 weihui road yangling shaanxi province 712100 china no 23 weihui road yangling shaanxi province 712100 china soil infiltration and manning s roughness values are key parameters to determine the performance of surface irrigation however temporal variability in these parameters due to tillage practices irrigation and crop growth greatly hinders efforts to improve irrigation quality the objective of this experiment was to evaluate effects of infiltration and surface roughness variation on irrigation water movement and irrigation performance indicators for border irrigation with three border lengths field experiments were conducted from 2013 to 2015 in a wheat triticum aestivum maize zea mays l rotation planting system at the jinghui canal irrigation area in guanzhong plain of northwest china in this work manning s equation and a surface irrigation simulation model winsrfr were used to estimate manning s roughness values and kostiakov soil infiltration parameters we determined that both parameters reached moderate levels of variation for both deep and shallow tillage treatments the impacts of temporal variation in soil infiltration and surface roughness on irrigation water movement and irrigation quality were then evaluated results showed that water advance times varied significantly while recession times varied much more affecting irrigation water amounts at various distances along the length of the border irrigation performance indicators were significantly different over various irrigation seasons especially for borders that were 235 m in length finally considering these temporal variations during the two rotation cycles combinations of inflow rate and cut off ratio during different irrigation seasons were optimized and high irrigation quality could be achieved for 80 m and 120 m borders but not for 235 m borders water percolation amounts during the 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 growing periods were reduced by 55 mm and 107 mm for 235 m borders 26 mm and 23 mm for 120 m borders and 36 mm and 39 mm for 80 m borders respectively therefore utilizing optimal combinations of inflow rate and cut off ratio and considering temporal variation in soil infiltration and manning s roughness could maintain high water application efficiency and sustainable utilization of limited water resources keywords soil infiltration parameters manning s roughness temporal variation irrigation performance 1 introduction the jinhui canal irrigation area is directly supplied with water from the jinghe river this area is located on the guanzhong plain in xianyang shaanxi province china in this region annual average rainfall is 550 mm potential evapotranspiration is high li et al 2013 and the main irrigation method is traditional surface irrigation because of the relatively low precipitation and high evaportranspiraton irrigation is necessary to maintain sustainable crop production surface irrigation is the oldest and most common irrigation method throughout the world even though it traditionally suffers from many problems such as low water application efficiency and low uniformity gillies and smith 2005 the main grain crops planted in the jinhui canal irrigation area are wheat and maize liu and zhu 2011 zhang et al 2016 however because of differences in crops grown weather conditions and tillage practices irrigation performance varies significantly across the region creating major problems in determining best management practices that will result in high water use efficiency in irrigated areas soil water infiltration is one of the most important processes affecting the volume transport route and water quality of agricultural drainage berehe et al 2013 and is a key parameter in surface irrigation models bautista and schlegel 2017 waller and yitayew 2016 soil infiltration determines the speed and distribution with which irrigation water or rain water seeps into the soil the soil infiltration capacity is one of the basic indicators used to determine irrigation technical parameters oyonarte et al 2002 zerihun et al 1996 furthermore soil infiltration is the second most important factor affecting border irrigation quality with inflow rate being the most important factor maheshwari et al 1988 a commonly used infiltration equation is the kostiakov equation walker et al 2006 walker and skogerboe 1987 soil infiltration characteristics are determined by a multitude of factors including soil texture soil structure soil water content and soil organic matter franzluebbers 2002 gillies et al 2011 li and fan 2006 zheng and fan 2000 tillage practices cause soil structure disruption but are essential farming practices that farmers use to influence soil and microclimate to maximize agricultural yield berehe et al 2013 because of tillage soil physical and chemical properties change during rotation cycles soil bulk density and soil moisture content in the cultivation layer experience temporal variability both of which influence the temporal variability of soil infiltration characteristics manning s roughness coefficient represents the effect of combined resistant forces which act opposite to the direction of flow mailapalli et al 2008 affecting irrigation water movement and irrigation quality there are many factors affecting roughness including soil texture surface roughness crop density and growth harun ur rashid 1990 valiantzas 1994 li and bing 2008 analyzed field roughness coefficients for different soil surface conditions mailapalli et al 2008 reported variation in manning s roughness coefficient for bare and cropped fields under furrow irrigation over the entire wheat maize crop rotation period the temporal variation of manning s roughness coefficient with border irrigation was not clear irrigation performance is used to describe the hydraulic performance or the ability to apply water efficiently and uniformly to the field gillies 2008 the performance of border irrigation systems depends on border dimensions border slope inflow rate cut off time manning s roughness coefficient and soil infiltration properties pereira et al 2002 reasonable optimization of irrigation technical parameters has been an important topic of long term studies smith et al 2005 zerihun et al 1997 researchers have worked to improve border irrigation performance optimizing border dimensions anwar et al 2016 miao et al 2015 inflow rates and cut off times morris et al 2015 salahou et al 2018 researchers have improved border irrigation performance by considering soil spatial variability bai et al 2017 2010 li et al 2001 nie et al 2014 wang et al 2009 however these studies rarely involved impacts of temporal variation in these parameters on irrigation water movement and irrigation performance during the different irrigation seasons within plant rotation cycles at the field scale the temporal variations of soil infiltration and manning s roughness are usually significant and thus significantly affect irrigation water movement and water quality assessing the variation of soil infiltration and manning s roughness values and related impacts on irrigation performance is therefore required to evaluate possible water savings in order to improve irrigation quality by taking into account thetemporal variation of soil infiltration parameters and manning s roughness coefficient a field study was conducted in the jinghui canal irrigation area with the following objectives 1 to estimate soil kostiakov infiltration parameters and manning s roughness coefficient and analyze their temporal variation 2 to evaluate the trajectory of irrigation water advance and recession and the performance of border irrigation when considering temporal variation in infiltration parameter k and manning s roughness 3 to establish different scenarios incorporating different values of infiltration parameter k and manning s roughness to assess the sensitivity ranges of these variables on irrigation performance and 4 to determine the optimal combination of inflow rate and cut off ratio during different irrigation seasons considering temporal variation in infiltration and surface roughness in order to maximize irrigation water application efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment the experiments were conducted at qiaodi 34 35 n 108 43 e located in the upper zone of the jinghui canal irrigation area 34 25 20 to 34 41 40 n 108 34 34 to 109 21 35 e from 2013 to 2015 the site is located in a semiarid to sub humid climate zone the soil type is lou soil with silty loam texture 22 7 clay 48 0 silt 29 3 sand the field capacity and wilting point are about 23 5 and 10 6 soil mass water content respectively and groundwater is at least 30 m below the surface fig 1 shows monthly cumulative solar radiation and cumulative precipitation in the jinghui canal irrigation area from 2013 to 2015 the main crop planting practice is a wheat maize rotation with summer maize cultivar wuke 2 grown during june to october and winter wheat cultivar xinong 979 grown from october to the next june the experiment was designed with different length borders of 80 m 120 m and 235 m with closed ends table 1 usually before sowing wheat farmers in this region till fields to varying depths 15 30 cm we therefore used deep tillage about 30 cm in the first year 2013 2014 and shallow tillage about 15 cm in the second year 2014 2015 prior to wheat sowing in each year irrigation events were conducted during the 2013 2015 irrigation seasons according to local farmers experience with the target irrigation depth of 90 mm per irrigation the usual depth of irrigation applied in the guanzhong plain region data collected for irrigation events five irrigation events during the 2013 2014 period and six during the 2014 2015 period and nine borders every length included three borders included inflow rate irrigation time cut off ratio flow depth at the start of the border for estimating manning s roughness water advance and recession times for estimating infiltration soil bulk density before irrigation and soil water content before and after irrigation inflow rate is an essential parameter for evaluating irrigation performance and we planned to consistently control the unit width discharge however we maintained inflow rate between 12 5 and 13 5 l m 1 s 1 measured with a hydrometric propeller because of the uncertainty in practice this was a reasonable inflow rate for the local conditions the cut off ratio was set as 0 7 for the 80 m and 120 m length borders and 0 8 for the 235 m length borders water depth at the start of the border for estimating manning s roughness was measured using a ruler fixed in place before irrigation the advance and recession times of water were measured every 10 m in the longitudinal direction of the border along which we placed stakes every 10 m soil bulk density was measured with 10 cm soil layers down to 30 cm at the head middle and tail of borders before every irrigation event furthermore to calculate the infiltration depth and irrigation performance indicators we measured gravimetric soil water content prior to and after each irrigation using the oven drying method with 10 cm soil layers down to 100 cm and 20 cm layers from 100 to 200 cm every 10 m in the longitudinal direction of the borders 2 2 data analysis 2 2 1 soil infiltration and manning s roughness the hydraulic roughness coefficient is expressed often in terms of manning s roughness coefficient n which was computed from observations of field slope inflow rate and flow depth harun ur rashid 1990 1 n s 0 5 h 1 67 q where n is the hydraulic roughness coefficient s is the slope of the energy line m m h is the water depth at the start of the border m and q is the unit width discharge l s 1 m 1 however there exist some weaknesses in using the manning equation to calculate resistance from our assumption that the irrigation flow is uniform difficult to maintain because water infiltrates along the field meanwhile s in eq 1 is difficult to measure and therefore we approximate the slope of the energy line with the slope of the water surface which is the same as slope of the border only if flow is uniform however we can assume that flow depths rise rapidly and attain near normal depth in a short time under the condition that the field slopes used for this experiment were close to 0 004 thus we could assume that depths will be close to normal for whatever flow rate is at a given distance in this experiment that approximation is reasonable because the field slope is essentially at the point where we can consider the flow kinematic the soil infiltration model used the two parameter kostiakov infiltration equation morris et al 2015 smith et al 2005 one of the most commonly used empirical functions for surface irrigation 2 i k t α where i is the cumulative depth of infiltration mm k is the fitted coefficient parameter mm h 1 α is the fitted exponent parameter and t is the infiltration time the infiltration parameter values were obtained using inverse model simulation with the hydraulic surface irrigation simulation model winsrfr4 1 bautista et al 2009a b this model s event analysis module includes two methods the merriam keller post irrigation volume balance analysis relying on water advance and water recession data and the elliot walker two point method analysis relying on two points of water advance data we chose the merriam keller post irrigation volume balance analysis first we put water advance and recession time data coupled with the manning s roughness value into the winsrfr model the initial value was set for α the k value was estimated by the winsrfr model and then we compared simulated water advance and recession curves with observed curves until a good fit between the two curves was achieved producing values of the kostiakov infiltration parameters k and α 2 2 2 irrigation performance indicators infiltration water depth wd mm along the border was calculated by observations of soil water content before and after every irrigation 3 w d i 1 15 θ i 1 θ i 0 h i where θi1 and θi0 are the soil volume water content after and before irrigation of the i soil layer respectively hi is soil depth of the i soil layer the indicators that were used in this study to evaluate the performance of closed end border irrigation were application efficiency ae requirement efficiency re distribution uniformity dulq and deep percolation average depth of water drained beyond the root zone dp mm burt et al 1997 these indicators were defined as follows 4 a e v o l u m e o f w a t e r a d d e d t o t h e r o o t z o n e t o t a l v o l u m e o f w a t e r a p p l i e

s n infiltration parameters water advance and recession times and infiltration volumes by using spss statistics 22 0 statistically significant comparisons were identified using least significant difference lsd tests correlation analysis was conducted based on the assumption that there exists a relationship between bulk density water content and infiltration parameters 2 3 sensitivity analyses and optimization of border irrigation to reveal the effect of these temporal variation factors manning s roughness and infiltration parameter k on the irrigation performance indicators sensitivity analysis with winsrfr4 1 software was conducted infiltration k values ranging from 100 to 200 mm h 1 and manning s roughness ranging from 0 04 to 0 22 were tested when sensitivity analysis for manning s roughness was performed average values of infiltration k and α were held constant when sensitivity analysis for infiltration k was performed the average value of manning s roughness was held constant for actual field irrigation areas border length and slope cannot be changed randomly and soil infiltration characteristics and roughness coefficient cannot be altered manually however optimum inflow rate and cut off ratio cut off time can be determined and controlled therefore we used the winsrfr4 1 model to continuously optimize the inflow rate and cut off ratio until the irrigation performance indicators were maximized our goal was for all irrigation performance indicator values to be over 80 and to minimize deep percolation 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal variation of infiltration and roughness 3 1 1 temporal variation of roughness temporal variation of manning s roughness coefficient for the irrigation events in the maize wheat rotation system existed in the jinghui canal irrigation area table 2 manning s roughness coefficient varied from 0 071 to 0 212 in the first rotation year and from 0 063 to 0 187 in the second rotation year for which the coefficient of variation cv values were 0 487 and 0 417 respectively mailapalli et al 2008 reported the temporal variation of manning s roughness coefficient for both bare and cropped furrow conditions decreased with elapsed time the greater variation of manning s roughness coefficient compared with their result may be due to crop variety and growth sepaskhah and bondar 2002 found that vegetation cover had the greatest effect on manning s roughness coefficient causing the value of manning s roughness coefficient to be increased three times for 100 vegetation cover gilley and kottwitz 1994 reported that resistance values may be minimal at the beginning of the cropping season and increase substantially by the time of crop maturity this result was consistent with our research that manning s roughness coefficient was significantly different p 0 05 in different irrigation seasons table 2 during the initial stage of the winter wheat growth period the borders were almost bare which caused little waterflow resistance at the next irrigation event wheat leaf area and canopy cover had developed causing an increase in the drag force of water most likely the variation in manning s roughness coefficient increased rapidly in early april due to increased wheat growth at the later irrigation event resulting in increased turbulence intensity causing additional loss of energy and flow retardance sepaskhah and bondar 2002 during the early part of the maize growth period manning s roughness coefficient was 0 09 greater than the 0 07 value found initially for wheat possibly due to the residue left by the wheat which generated little drag force for water flow however in the later irrigation manning s roughness coefficient was almost unchanged with the increased growth of maize table 2 this is probably because of the greater spacing between maize plants compared with spacing between wheat plants and the consequent lesser resistance to water movement these results were in accordance with the results of gilley and kottwitz 1994 who reported that wheat roughness coefficient ranged from 0 11 to 0 27 while maize roughness coefficient ranged from 0 0018 to 0 0810 the results were similar in the second year what is particularly noteworthy is that manning s roughness coefficient was only slightly p 0 05 decreased at the third irrigation event 20 august 2015 from its value at the second irrigation event 20 july 2015 during the maize growth period table 2 most likely this is because the surface of border irrigation areas became smoother due to decomposition of wheat residue during the later maize growth period in conclusion the influence of deep or shallow tillage on manning s roughness values was not significant p 0 05 while plant species plant growth and previous residue amount and type were the main factors resulting in temporal variation of manning s roughness table 2 3 1 2 temporal variation of soil infiltration there was a considerable change of kostiakov infiltration parameters at different irrigation dates for the wheat maize rotation system table 2 k values varied from 120 to 196 mm h 1 in the first rotation year and from 114 to 175 mm h 1 in the second rotation year during which the cv values were 0 176 and 0 151 respectively the degree of temporal variation of the soil infiltration k value in both wheat maize rotation cycles reached a moderate level 0 1 cv 1 temporal variability in infiltration can be attributed to soil structure soil bulk density and soil moisture content table 3 infiltration k was negatively influenced by soil bulk density slightly p 0 05 and soil water content p 0 05 while infiltration α was negatively influenced by soil bulk density p 0 05 and positively influenced by soil water content slightly p 0 05 these results agreed with the results of li et al 2009 in early october before wheat was planted the borders were tilled deep 30 cm which altered soil structure causing the soil to become loose soil bulk density was reduced to 1 15 g cm 3 fig 2 the lowest value of the year and the water content was lower before the first irrigation during the wheat growth period at this time the soil had larger internal pores higher connectivity and lower resistance to the movement of infiltration water characterized by an increase in soil water infiltration coefficient k to 190 mm h 1 at the first irrigation event table 2 after the compaction effect of the first irrigation and a subsequent rainfall event fig 1a soil bulk density increased considerably 17 to 1 35 g cm 3 at the next irrigation event fig 2 meanwhile water content was about 19 in order to ensure that the winter wheat could survive the winter the second irrigation event was carried out at this time soil compactness increased porosity decreased and pore connectivity decreased all of which generated greater resistance to the movement of infiltration water coupled to higher soil bulk density and moisture content thus the kostiakov infiltration k value decreased significantly p 0 05 to 120 mm h 1 table 2 in early april soil bulk density decreased slightly to 1 32 g cm 3 probably due to loose soil caused by alternation of soil freezing and thawing plants developed rapidly during this period consuming a large quantity of water and reducing soil moisture content to 15 7 moreover wheat roots that were developing in early april created channels in the soil profile that eventually led to quicker passage of water eventually the kostiakov infiltration k value increased sharply p 0 05 to 181 mm h 1 table 2 then soil bulk density increased to 1 38 g cm 3 during the early stages of maize growth fig 2 before the first irrigation event was applied in order to ensure maize seedling emergence this increase in bulk densidty was probably due to soil compaction following a long period of continuous rain fig 1b resulting in a slight decrease p 0 05 in the kostiakov infiltration k value compared with the last irrigation table 2 before the second irrigation of maize soil structure was relatively stable and soil bulk density changed only slightly however soil evaporation and plant transpiration were great during this period of low precipitation resulting in lower soil moisture content 16 1 fig 2 at the same time many cracks appeared in the soil surface of the borders due to low precipitation and the dry surface soil condition eventually the kostiakov infiltration k value increased significantly p 0 05 to 195 mm h 1 when the second irrigation event was carried out during the second wheat maize rotation cycle the borders received shallow tillage 15 cm before wheat was planted causing soil bulk density to increase to 1 25 g cm 3 more than in the initial wheat phase of the first wheat maize rotation cycle the kostiakov infiltration parameter α values in the two year rotation cycles varied from 0 451 to 0 643 in the first year and from 0 469 to 0 556 in the second year table 2 for which the cv values were 0 159 and 0 062 respectively furman et al 2006 suggested that there was no reason to treat the exponent of an infiltration power law as a variable quantity and suggested using a value of 0 45 however soil structure is periodically disturbed and destroyed due to cultivation irrigation and rainfall likely causing varied values of α table 2 before wheat was planted in early october of the first year of the study the borders were tilled deep followed by shallow tillage in the second year which likely explains why temporal variation in α values in the first year was much greater p 0 05 than in the second year 3 2 temporal variability in the trajectory of water advance and recession fig 3 shows the water advance and recession trajectory curves relative to different length borders and various irrigation seasons advance time depends on manning s roughness influencing the resistance value and the infiltration k value influencing driving forces in the process of water advance advance curves varied over time in the various irrigation seasons for all border lengths and recession curves varied much more water advance time varied from 10 8 min to 21 7 min for 80 m borders 19 9 min to 44 1 min for 120 m borders and 49 6 min to 87 2 min for 235 m borders during the 2013 2014 rotation cycle irrigation events on 20 oct 2013 and 11 jan 2014 produced the highest advance rate and were not significantly different p 0 05 table 4 due to lower manning s roughness and lower infiltration parameter k table 2 in contrast the lowest advance rate 21 7 min appeared on 2 apr 2014 due to the highest manning s roughness value which characterized the greater resistance to water advance and high infiltration parameter k that reduced part of the driving force table 2 there was no significant difference p 0 05 between the two irrigation events during maize growth probably due to only slightly different manning s roughness value and infiltration parameter k table 2 with shallow tillage during 2014 2015 the range of temporal variation of water advance time values was greatly reduced showing lower cv values than during 2014 2015 table 4 with water advance times ranging from 12 1 min to 17 2 min for 80 m borders 15 7 min to 29 4 min for 120 m borders and 41 0 min to 69 3 min for 235 m borders recession time depends on how the infiltration k value is influenced by the water infiltration rate and the irrigation time which ultimately determine the irrigation water volume affecting the infiltration duration time from the recession curves fig 3 we observed that recession time varied from 25 min to 98 min for 80 m borders 41 3 min to 88 3 min for 120 m borders and 71 7 min to 238 0 min for 235 m borders during the first rotation cycle similarly long water recession times were observed at both the head and tail of borders on 2 apr 2014 significantly different p 0 05 from other recession times at the other irrigation events table 4 during 2013 2014 during 2013 2014 we observed lower variation lower cv at the head of the borders than at the tail of the borders and this was especially true for the 80 m and 120 m length borders during 2014 2015 this may be due to the fact that less advance time variation led to the lower recession time variation at the head of borders but the same cut off ratio value for various irrigation seasons resulted in significant differences p 0 05 in water at the tail of the borders at different irrigation seasons especially during wheat growth table 4 causing higher variation at the tail of the borders during the second year 3 3 analysis of irrigation performance advance and recession times determine opportunity times along the field and ultimately infiltrated water and irrigation performance the infiltrated water depth along the border under the temporal variation of infiltration parameters and manning roughness was compared in fig 4 the measured values of infiltrated water depth along different border lengths in different irrigation seasons were variable and non uniform in spatial temporal distribution especially for water depth on 2 apr 2014 that was significantly different p 0 05 from others fig 4a1 b1 c1 it is worth mentioning that water at the tail of all of the borders was significantly different with respect to the temporal variation which showed water accumulating at the tail of the borders and infiltrating deeper during some irrigation events e g 11 mar 2015 whereas for other irrigation events infiltration was inadequate fig 4 in response to the shallow tillage during the 2014 2015 rotation cycle differences in water distribution along the borders were lower than during the first year when deep tillage was employed except at the tail of the borders variation in applied irrigation amount affecting irrigation performance was mainly caused by variation in infiltration and roughness coefficient under the same inflow rate and cut off distance table 5 applied irrigation amount during the wheat growth period of turning green to elongation 2 apr 2014 11 mar 2015 was much greater than at other irrigation dates due to greater infiltration parameters and manning s roughness which is quite different from the applied irrigation amount to wheat during earlier growth stages during the maize production period we found no significant difference p 0 05 in irrigation amounts applied among the irrigation events mainly due to no significant differences p 0 05 in infiltration parameters and manning s roughness tables 2 and 4 there were two irrigation events 20 oct 2013 11 jan 2014 where the applied irrigation amount was significantly less p 0 05 than at other irrigation dates and less than the target water depth of 90 mm also there was one irrigation event 2 apr 2014 where the irrigation application amount was far greater than at other dates for 80 m length borders in the first year three irrigation events applied irrigation amounts that were far greater than 90 mm except for two satisfactory irrigation events 20 oct 2013 11 jan 2014 for the 120 m length borders irrigation application amounts for all of the irrigation events with the 235 mm borders were far greater than 90 mm the irrigation performance indicators were estimated for an application depth of 90 mm all three parameters showed variation due to temporal variation in the infiltration parameter and manning s roughness fig 5 we observed that lower values of ae 69 for 80 m 58 for 120 m and 42 for 235 m borders during 2013 2014 82 for 80 m 74 for 120 m and 54 for 235 m during 2014 2015 appeared on 2 apr 2014 and 11 mar 2015 respectively the dates with larger infiltration parameter and manning s roughness values that resulted in much deeper percolation of water along the borders table 5 lower dulq values are generally attributed to the condition of insufficient water stored in the root zone and a large amount of water at the tail of the border as occurred on 11 jan 2014 14 jan 2015 and 11 mar 2015 for the 80 m border water at the tail of the border is a major component of the amount of deep percolation water and occurs when the infiltration parameter value is low causing a rapid flow rate and large amounts of water to accumulate in the tail on 20 oct 2013 and 10 jun 2015 for the 235 m border a large amount of water was stored in the root zone and there was little water in the tail of the border mainly owing to the longer borders and larger infiltration parameters which led to less water in the border s tail and more water distributed in other part of the borders fig 4 similarly lower re values on 3 nov 2014 73 for 80 m border and 75 for 120 m border were due to insufficient water stored in the root zone caused by lower infiltration parameter values and small manning s roughness value in addition we found that ae values were reduced when borders were too long the ae values were all lower than 80 for the 235 m borders leading to large volumes of wasted water meanwhile we found that the total amount of water that percolated deeply increased with increasing border length table 5 this result suggests that border length should be determined in order to adjust infiltration time such that the required water depth can be obtained comparing cv values of ae 0 19 235 m 0 15 120 m 0 10 80 m dulq 0 12 80 m 0 08 235 m 0 04 120 m and re 0 12 80 m 0 08 120 m 0 01 235 m we found that the most sensitive irrigation performance indicators due to the variation of infiltration parameters and roughness were du and re for 80 m borders and ae for 235 m borders 3 4 sensitivity analysis of temporal variation factors the results of the analyses of irrigation performance indicators for sensitivity to manning s roughness and infiltration parameter k are shown in fig 6 for different length borders in general these temporal variability factors have different effects on irrigation performance indicators due to different length borders these results indicated that re increased as the manning s roughness increased from 0 04 to 0 22 for all border lengths and ae decreased with increasing manning s roughness for all border lengths fig 6 a1 a3 when manning s roughness is lower the velocity of water flow is faster which leads to the lower amounts of infiltration water stored in the root layer thus larger ae values and smaller re values as the water flow rate decreases due to larger manning s roughness more and more water is stored in the root system however water advance momentum would still exist resulting in more water in the tail of the border a larger re value and a smaller ae value however for larger values of manning s roughness more than 0 14 for 80 m more than 0 10 for 120 m and more than 0 06 for 235 m length borders the re values were less sensitive to changes in manning s roughness but ae values were more sensitive dulq values slightly decreased as the manning s roughness increased for 80 m borders but slightly increased for 120 m and 235 m borders for 80 m borders at a 0 7 cut off ratio the water at the tail of the borders a factor that affects du values changes from a moderate amount to an excessive amount as manning s roughness increases but for 120 m and 235 m borders the water in the tail of the border changes from an insufficient amount to a moderate amount and then to an excessive amount which leads to the different trends of dulq for different border lengths dulq values were somewhat sensitive to any change in manning s roughness with 80 m borders in contrast dulq values were more sensitive to changes in manning s roughness for both 120 m and 235 m borders if values were less than 0 10 furthermore when values of all irrigation performance indicators were greater than 80 the values of manning s roughness ranged from 0 08 to 0 16 for 80 m borders and from 0 08 0 12 for 120 m borders for the 235 m borders ae values were lower than 80 for manning s roughness values from 0 04 0 22 fig 6 b1 b2 shows the results of the sensitivity analyses over a range of values of the infiltration parameter k from 100 200 mm h 1 for the 80 m and 120 m borders values of all three irrigation performance indicators ae dulq re were sensitive to changes in k and first increased and then decreased with the increase of k values for 80 m and 120 m borders high values of performance indicators 80 were obtained for infiltration parameter k values ranging from 150 200 mm h 1 and 120 180 mm h 1 respectively as k values reached a certain threshold range the velocity of water flow slows down more and more water is stored in the root zone along the length of the borders the ratio of water accumulated at the tail of the borders is lower and distribution of infiltrated water along the borders is more and more uniform resulting in high ae dulq and re values once k values were higher than 150 mm h 1 for 120 m borders more water accumulated and infiltrated deeper into soil at the front part of the borders than it did at the tail of borders where no irrigation water reached resulting in lower ae dulq and re values furthermore results from fig 6 b1 b2 indicated that values of all irrigation performance indicators for 120 m borders were more sensitive to change than for 80 m borders if k values were more than 150 mm h 1 for 235 m borders re values were not sensitive to changes in k as irrigation water was far below the root zone the sensitivity trend for dulq values was the same with 80 m and 120 m borders the ae values were more sensitive to change because more and more irrigation water infiltrated deep with the increase of k value 3 5 optimization of border irrigation unreasonable irrigation water flow and cut off ratio cut off time due to temporal variation of infiltration parameter k value and manning s roughness resulted in significant differences p 0 05 in irrigation quality during different irrigation seasons therefore it is necessary to optimize the combination of irrigation technology parameters inflow rate and cut off ratio in different irrigation seasons to minimize discrepancies in irrigation performance following recommendations from the united states department of agriculture and given the actual practices used in the experimental irrigation area we estimated the applicable ranges of unit width discharge q and cut off ratio cr as 4 l s 1 m 1 q 15 l s 1 m 1 and 0 5 cr 1 0 the results are listed in table 6 although we tried to optimize inflow rate and cut off ratio it is clear from table 6 that we generally did not obtain higher irrigation quality for 235 m borders except for the second irrigation event due to a low value of the infiltration parameter k at this time more advance time occurs with 235 m borders causing large volumes of water to infiltrate deep into the soil root zone which produced ae values that were as low as 49 71 even though values of other performance indicators were higher table 6 the total amounts of water percolated for 235 m borders were 266 mm and 185 mm during the two rotation cycles respectively while these are extreme values of drainage loss even though these values were reduced by 55 mm and 107 mm respectively compared with the irrigation events before optimization tables 5 and 6 for the 120 m borders all indicator values were higher than 80 except for the third irrigation event on 2 april 2014 due to larger values of infiltration k and manning s roughness values the total amounts of water percolated with optimization were 85 mm and 29 mm during the two rotation years respectively which were reduced by 26 mm and 23 mm tables 5 and 6 here the optimized unit width discharges for borders ranged between 6 15 l s 1 m 1 during the period of a rotation cycle for 80 m borders all values of the irrigation performance indicators were greater than 80 after optimization similarly the total amounts of water percolated during the two rotation years 30 mm and 2 mm were reduced by 36 mm and 39 mm tables 5 and 6 respectively here the optimized unit width discharges for borders ranged between 4 15 l s 1 m 1 during the period of a rotation cycle furthermore it is clear that the optimized unit width discharges were increased with the increase of border length table 6 farmers should increase the inflows and reduce the cut off ratio to prevent excess water from accumulating at the tail of borders with the increase of infiltration k and manning s roughness coefficient values 4 conclusions to maintain high irrigation water application efficiency and sustainable use of limited water resources for a specific area evaluation and optimization of irrigation performance in different irrigation seasons should consider temporal variations of infiltration parameter and manning s roughness in this study manning s roughness coefficient and soil kostiakov infiltration parameters in different irrigation seasons were estimated using manning s equation and the winsrfr model to analyze the degree of temporal variation water advance and recession curves and irrigation performance indicators were evaluated considering temporal variation combinations of inflow rate and cut off ratio in different irrigation seasons were optimized to increase irrigation quality performance indicators the following conclusions were drawn from the results 1 manning s roughness values ranged from 0 07 to 0 2 in different irrigation seasons during the 2013 2014 rotation cycle with deep tillage and ranged from 0 063 to 0 187 during 2014 2015 with shallow tillage which implied that manning s roughness values were mainly affected by crop growth kostiakov infiltration parameters were mainly affected by soil bulk density and water content especially the k value which had average values ranging from 120 to 195 mm h 1 during the 2013 2014 rotation cycle and ranging from 114 to 175 mm h 1 during the 2014 2015 rotation cycle temporal variation of manning s roughness values and k values reached a moderate degree 0 1 cv 1 2 the impact of the soil infiltration and manning s roughness variability on water advance and recession curves was non negligible for various border lengths water advance times had slightly significant variation while recession times varied more significantly the difference was more pronounced for the 235 m borders for both shallow tillage and deep tillage treatments the temporal variations of water advance and recession times were slightly different affecting irrigation water amount at various distances along the length of the borders thus affecting the irrigation performance indicators 3 there were only a few irrigation events where all values of irrigation performance indicators reached 80 during the two rotation cycles due to temporal variation of soil infiltration and manning s roughness the most sensitive irrigation performance indicators differed with the different border lengths with du and re being most sensitive for 80 m borders and ae being the most sensitive performance indicator for 235 m borders 4 the sensitivity analysis showed that re values increased gradually with the increase of manning s roughness coefficient while ae values exhibited the opposite trend the dulq values varied with the length of the borders under the local irrigation conditions ae re and dulq were sensitive to changes in the infiltration parameter k all three performance indicators first increased and then decreased with the increasing k value except for ae and re with 235 m borders nevertheless borders of different lengths have different ranges of sensitive values for soil infiltration and manning s roughness 5 by optimizing the technical parameters of irrigation during different irrigation seasons while considering temporal variations of soil infiltration and manning s roughness high quality irrigation could be achieved for 80 m and 120 m length borders but not for 235 m borders as a result during the two rotation cycles investigated in this study the amounts of deep percolation water could be reduced by 55 mm and 107 mm for 235 m borders 26 mm and 23 mm for 120 m borders and 36 mm and 39 mm for 80 m borders therefore utilizing optimal combinations of inflow rate and cut off ratio and considering temporal variation in soil infiltration and manning s roughness could maintain high irrigation water application efficiency and sustainable utilization of limited water resources acknowledgements this study was funded by the national key research and development program of china

11154,the irrigation water requirement ir is crucial for optimizing agricultural water management and reallocation and for adjusting the planting structure based on the datasets derived from 277 meteorological stations and 42 agro meteorological stations from 1980 to 2012 the simplified water balance equation was employed to estimate the ir in the winter wheat summer maize rotation system the results indicated that for the two crops the crop coefficients varied with time and space at different growth stages with low or moderate variability levels the average values of kcini kcmid and kcend were 0 69 1 17 0 34 and 0 76 1 13 0 43 for winter wheat and summer maize respectively the region located to the most of northern parts of the yellow river had reduced precipitation and increased reference evapotranspiration eto during the rotation cycle moreover in the southern part of this region the precipitation increased significantly with distinctly decreased eto in the north china plain ncp the ir for the winter wheat summer maize and rotation cycle all had no significant trend change for which the multi year average values were 341 1 250 5 and 592 5 mm respectively the region with higher ir was primarily located in northern shandong and the most of northern parts of the yellow river where the ir level was remarkably aggravated in dry seasons additionally the ir increased in the northern ncp region and in the junction area between hebei and shandong and ir decreased with a trend of 10 mm decade 1 in other areas in addition the magnitude of the station and time intervals for

1 introduction currently climate change and freshwater scarcity have been viewed as the two most important global issues by scientists policymakers and even the public united nations environmental programme 2000 döll and stefan 2002 the global surface temperature increased by 0 85 c over the period from 1880 to 2012 which is in line with the intensified variability of precipitation ipcc 2013 additionally it should be noted that the substantial reduction in precipitation likely takes place in mid latitude regions where especially in asia surface and groundwater has been depleted to maintain the wide range of irrigation inducing severe environmental problems shi et al 2011 turral et al 2011 the predominant cropping pattern on the north china plain ncp is the winter wheat summer maize rotation system for which large amounts of total water consumption are utilized to contribute to 17 of the grain yield in the whole nation fig 1 yao 2017 however the ncp is affected by climatic warming and drying and the extent frequency and intensity of drought has increased in recent decades yuan et al 2015 chen and sun 2015 moreover because surface water is almost entirely reserved to supply industrial and domestic consumption there is no further exploitation potential for groundwater to fulfil production demands to avoid environmental and geological issues under current conditions sun et al 2010 shi et al 2011 inevitably the production of the double cropping system is influenced to some extent by water shortage induced by all of these inverse factors that threaten the water requirements for agriculture thus obtaining detailed knowledge of the spatial temporal variation in irrigation requirement for the winter wheat and summer maize rotation system under climate change is crucial for optimizing agricultural water management and reallocation and for adjusting the planting structure from the perspective of sustainable development which is a part of the policy termed as the national plan for sustainable development 2015 2030 that was approved by the state council of the people s republic of china npsd 2015 the irrigation water requirement ir is one of the most important parameters in irrigated agricultural systems and this value is distinct from the crop water requirement cwr which refers to the water supplemented by irrigation and the water conservancy infrastructure to ensure that the crop grows in its optimal water conditions savva and frenken 2002 overall approaches employed by previous research to estimate ir can generally be classified into two categories crop model and the direct adoption of field balance equation the former method drives crop models with a series of complicated parameters such as meteorological data genetic parameters and physical and hydrological properties ding et al 2017 döll and stefan 2002 there is no doubt that the superiority of crop models lies in characterizing the dynamics of crop development at the site scale nevertheless to ensure the accuracy of the simulated results precise parameterization and calibration are essential in addition operating models with limited field experimental data have difficulty effectively reflecting the spatial variability of ir due to large scale topographic heterogeneity yang et al 2010 ding et al 2017 the latter method obtains the magnitude of the ir as a function of the conservation of mass by considering the relevant parameters among these the cwr can be determined by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration eto by the crop coefficient which is termed as the crop coefficient method and is widely applied in studies of farmland and grassland ecosystems yang and zhou 2011 zhang et al 2012 marin et al 2016 based on the water balance method several studies related to ir have been performed for a variety of crops in different regions under the present and or future context in china zhu et al 2014 ding et al 2017 however to our knowledge almost all of these reports kept the crop coefficients of the different growth stages as constants over the entire study period in fact the crop coefficient is a variable that is determined by crop type climate soil evaporation and crop growth stage and the crop coefficient is used to distinguish typical field crops from the well watered grass reference allen et al 1998 in addition along with the dramatic variation in the precipitation status ipcc 2013 gaining deep insight into the spatial distribution of ir in different year types has very important significance then are there any distinct variations for irrigation requirement and its influence factor crop coefficient of the specific planting structure on the ncp in the last few decades under climate change as a consequence in our study considering that the crop coefficients of winter wheat and summer maize are influenced by biotic and abiotic factors the adjustment of crop coefficients in the corresponding growth stages must be carried out at each site and in each year for the two specific crops respectively subsequently the field water balance equation was used to detect the spatial temporal variability of the ir for the individual growing season and the double cropping system under the conditions of climate change in addition the spatial distribution patterns of the ir were displayed for the double cropping system in wet and dry years on the ncp the results were expected to identify the state of the ir and to serve as a reference for policymakers to propose relevant strategies for agriculture on the ncp 2 data and methods 2 1 study area located in the eastern part of china the ncp ranges from the latitudes of 32 08 n to 40 23 n and the longitudes of 112 51 e to 122 42 e with an area of 4 105 km2 that is covered by most areas of five provinces hebei henan shandong anhui and jiangsu and two cities beijing and tianjin moreover the ncp has an average elevation of 73 4 m above sea level fig 1 the region is dominated by a temperate monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature of 12 8 14 9 c and a mean annual precipitation of 472 7 889 2 mm of which approximately 70 occurs from june to september statistics during 1980 2012 the major provinces henan and shandong both have been facing with significant trend of decreasing of total water resources since the 21st century though the amount of total water resources in hebei province has no distinct trend change only about 1 8 1010 m3 of reserve water is far less than the average in the ncp fig s1 as the alluvial plain has mainly developed by the intermittent flooding of the yellow river loam and sandy loam textured soil are the primary soil types on the basis of the sampling of agro meteorological stations in the ncp fig 1 in addition the major cropping pattern is the winter wheat summer maize double cropping system generally the winter wheat is sown in early october in the previous year and harvested in early or mid june in the following year and the timing of sowing and harvesting for summer maize are at the end of may and september in the same year respectively 2 2 data source and quality control in this study there are three types of datasets used to estimate the ir including meteorological data crop data and soil hydrological and physical parameters collected by the national meteorological information centre of the china meteorological administration the detailed descriptions of the data screening are presented as follows the historical observed meteorological data consisting of the maximum temperature minimum temperature sunshine duration wind speed at a height of 10 m average relative humidity minimum relative humidity and precipitation on a daily timescale were obtained for the period from 1980 to 2012 at 443 stations due to missing data and site migration only these stations were employed after the following selection criteria were used in sequence 1 no missing data for each element within the entire month 2 migration distance of the station is less than 10 km relative to the original position and the elevation is no more than 200 m and 3 proportion of missing data for each element is controlled within 1 then these gaps were filled using the following strategies 1 linear interpolation when the number of consecutive missing data was 5 and substitution with the mean value of other years when the number of consecutive missing data was 5 for all variables except for precipitation and 2 replacement with the value on the same day based on the nearest meteorological station for only the precipitation data ultimately 277 meteorological stations had complete time series and were selected for analysis of which 236 stations were evenly distributed within the ncp and the remaining sites encompassed the region fig 1 based on the sunshine hours and wind speed at a height of 10 m the net radiation and wind speed at a height of 2 m were calculated by the methods suggested by the fao allen et al 1998 the crop data for the different crops such as the phenological phase plant height and irrigation volume were derived from 42 agro meteorological stations where winter wheat and summer maize were planted in cycles fig 1 the data records started from the planting of winter wheat in 1980 and ended with the harvesting of summer maize in 2012 however the number of sites available per rotation period varied over time from 1981 to 2012 as there were finite observed agro meteorological stations before the 1990s and patchy observation records fig 2 despite this the distribution of the agro meteorological stations was still relatively homogeneous even when there were only 15 stations in 1981 and 1982 in addition more than 26 stations could be used for the analysis in most of the rotation periods once performing the adjustment for the crop coefficients in specific agro meteorological stations the required meteorological data such as precipitation wind speed and minimum relative humidity were derived from each respective weather station or the nearest weather station five sites had no meteorological information the soil hydrological and physical parameters from 42 agro meteorological stations comprised the soil type field capacity θfc m3 m 3 and wilting point θwp m3 m 3 at a depth of 0 1 m which is recommended by the fao when the effective depth of the soil evaporation layer is unknown allen et al 1998 because the data length was only eight years i e 2003 2010 and because the soil parameters that were measured annually rarely changed between years the multi year average values for relevant parameters were adopted to represent the long term status of the soil property 2 3 adjustment for crop coefficients the growing periods of winter wheat and summer maize were separated into four distinct growth stages initial crop development mid season and late season based on the crop phenological information fig s2 the single crop coefficient approach was used to calculate the crop coefficients at three different stages allen et al 1998 1 k cini tew tew rew exp t w t 1 e so 1 rew tew rew tew t w e t omean t w t 1 e so e t omean 1 15 t w t 1 2 k

the late season stages respectively kcmid tab and kcend tab are the typical crop coefficients recommended by fao 56 in corresponding stages in sub humid climates rhmin 45 u2 2 m s 1 tew is calculated by θfc and θwp and is the total evaporable water from the surface soil layer mm rew is the readily evaporable water and refers to the typical value tabulated in fao 56 mm etomean is the average

a height of 2 m minimum relative humidity and crop height over the corresponding growth stages respectively notably the crop coefficient of winter wheat over the dormancy period was set to 0 4 kcdor tao et al 2003 then based on the kcini kcmid kcend and crop phenology period the daily crop coefficient could be computed by linear interpolation 2 4 irrigation water requirements following fao 46 the ir during the growing season is defined as the difference between the cwr and the effective rainfall smith 1992 in fact the method is applicable in the ncp where the ground water table is low in most areas shi et al 2011 when the water that is stored in the soil at the beginning of each individual growing season and the leaching requirements are ignored smith 1992 döll and stefan 2002 the ir is computed as 4 ir e t c p e e t c p e 0 e t c p e where ir is the daily irrigation water requirement mm day 1 etc is the daily crop water requirement mm day 1 and pe is the daily effective precipitation mm day 1 etc is the crop evapotranspiration under standard conditions and the value is determined at each meteorological station by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration by the crop coefficient derived from the nearest agro meteorological site 5 e t c k c e t o where kc is the daily crop coefficient as mentioned in section 2 3 and eto is the reference crop evapotranspiration

analysis abrupt change detection and mapping the coefficient of variation cv is adopted to describe the temporal variability of the relevant elements the variability levels were classified by cv 0 1 0 1 cv 1 0 and cv 1 0 as weak moderate or strong respectively ayantobo et al 2017 the annual time series of the relevant indices for the double cropping system were calculated at the site and regional scales the tendency rates of the annual indices were computed using linear trend by least squares for the study period fang et al 2016a furthermore the nonparametric mann kendall trend test was employed to characterize the significance of the trend for the time series due to its extensive application fang et al 2016b deng et al 2018 considering the possible impact on the result of the mann kendall trend test by the serial correlation of time series the pre whitening approach was applied before performing the test yue and wang 2002 deng et al 2018 the significance level α of the mann kendall trend test was set to 0 05 then the standard normal test statistic zs was computed by which a significant increasing trend exists in the time series if zs 1 96 and a significant decreasing trend exists in the time series if zs 1 96 if not there is no significant trend change abrupt change detection is used to check the possible change point of the time series that has an effect on the trend analysis results villarini et al 2012 gu et al 2017 in this study two methods detecting mutational points were used namely the mann kendall abrupt test and the 5 year moving t test the reason for using the latter simultaneously is that it helps to deal with the multiple point mutations after using the mann kendall abrupt test and ensures the accuracy of the test results fang et al 2016b similarly the level of significance was set to 0 05 a variety of techniques can be adopted to generate a continuous map to characterize the spatial distribution of relevant indices as the most commonly used interpolation methods the kriging method was utilized because of its ability to provide an unbiased estimation and fully reflect the spatial structure of the variables dong et al 2018 in addition all procedures were carried out using arcgis 10 0 software 3 results 3 1 inter annual variation in kc for winter wheat and summer maize with the help of climatic phenological and soil information the change characteristics of kc were captured at different growth stages for winter wheat and summer maize as shown in fig 3 for winter maize the multi year average kcini was 0 69 for which there was no significant linear trend and a moderate variability level from 1981 to 2012 meanwhile it can be seen that the kcini along with approximately 0 2 of the standard deviation varied from 0 12 to 1 15 among the different agro stations in the same year which is in accordance with the statement in fao 56 allen et al 1998 in addition the multi year average kcmid and kcend values were 1 17 and 0 34 respectively two values were slightly greater than the tabulated kc in the corresponding stages unlike the inter annual characteristics exhibited over kcini the variability levels of kcmid and kcend were extremely weak for winter wheat from 1981 to 2012 and there were only a few differences between sites for summer maize the multi year average kcini was 0 76 with weak variability level and no significant trend nevertheless the great distinction of kcini similar to that of kcini of the winter wheat existed between stations the multi year average values of kcmid and kcend were 1 13 and 0 43 respectively two of which were all less than the tabulated values of kc recommended by fao 56 allen et al 1998 similarly the variability of the kcmid and kcend of summer maize for the study period and between sites was small compared to that of winter wheat 3 2 spatial temporal variation of eto and precipitation based on the climatic elements of 236 meteorological stations distributed over the ncp the characteristics of eto and precipitation during the winter wheat season the summer maize season and the whole rotation cycle were detected the spatial distribution pattern of eto was generally coherent during the winter wheat season and the rotation cycle increasing gradually from southwest to northeast the bohai rim region however for the summer maize season it was found that the high value region was located along the strip extending from the mid west part of the ncp to the bohai rim region around which the eto decreased as the distance increased in addition a clear southeast northwest gradient of precipitation was detected over the ncp in all three seasons and only the magnitude of precipitation was distinct fig 4 as a whole the average total eto varied weakly and had no obvious trend change over time with multi year mean values of 538 8 402 0 and 940 8 mm for the winter wheat the summer maize and the rotation cycle respectively although significant linear trends of average total precipitation were not detected for the three seasons the inter annual variability was relatively large as all coefficients of variation were approximately 0 2 the multi year mean values of precipitation for the three seasons were 184 0 416 7 and 597 3 mm respectively fig 5 specifically there were remarkably disparate temporal variations in eto and precipitation over different areas among the three seasons fig 4 for eto an irregular spatial distribution of tendency was found in the winter wheat season over the ncp and the variation in most parts of the ncp displayed a downward trend apart from the northern and southeastern regions especially for the southwest and mid west of the ncp with a significant decreasing trend of at least 5 mm decade 1 it is noteworthy that a nearly similar spatial distribution trend of eto between the summer maize season and the rotation cycle was detected generally characterized by the boundary of the yellow river in both sides of which the change in eto showed an inverse tendency for precipitation most of the northern parts of the yellow river and the southern ncp had increasing trends of precipitation in the winter maize season and downward trends were displayed in other regions although the trend was not significant at the 0 05 significance level in contrast to the spatial pattern of the trend of eto presented over the ncp for the summer maize and the rotation cycle the spatial distribution of the trend of precipitation exhibited almost an opposite status in the corresponding seasons briefly in addition to the complicated spatial pattern of trends of eto and precipitation over the winter wheat season the state with stronger atmospheric evaporative demand and less precipitation was imposed in the regions such as the northern part of the yellow river especially in terms of the jing jin ji region beijing tianjin hebei of the ncp 3 3 spatial temporal variation and abrupt change in ir by combining kc and eto with precipitation together the ir was calculated for the winter wheat the summer maize and the rotation cycle respectively in terms of spatial variation of ir in the winter wheat season it gradually increased from the southwest to northeast and a high value centre was located around the bohai rim region where the ir reached 400 mm the spatial pattern of ir for summer maize was similar to that of eto in the same season with more than 250 mm of ir within the strip expanding from the bohai rim region to the mid west of the ncp where the ir in northern shandong was relatively high there was also a gradient of distribution of ir for the rotation cycle and approximately half of the ncp where the ir was usually higher than 600 mm consisted of the jing jin ji region and most parts of shandong and the high value centre of the ir was located in northern shandong fig 6 statistical results showed that the inter annual variation in the ir for the winter wheat the summer maize and the rotation cycle had no significant trends with zs values of 0 1 67 and 1 02 respectively from the mann kendall trend test the multi year average ir values were 341 1 250 5 and 592 5 mm for these three seasons respectively of which the moderate variability of ir existed in both winter wheat and summer maize seasons and the weak variability of ir only existed in the rotation cycle fig 7 nevertheless the distinct variability of ir trends was found among the three seasons in the different sub regions for winter wheat the regions with decreasing ir mainly occurred within two strips that extended from central hebei to the southwestern ncp and to the shandong peninsula the ir in the rest of the ncp showed an increasing trend for summer maize the partial region such as the northern ncp and the junction area between hebei and shandong had an increasing ir trend however it can be clearly found that the ir decreased with a trend of 10 mm decade 1in most of southern parts of the yellow river within which the ir in some regions including the southwestern ncp and the strip extending from southwestern shandong to the northeastern ncp decreased significantly by 20 mm decade 1 for the rotation cycle the overall spatial pattern of the trend in ir was similar to that of the trend in the summer maize season apart from a slight reduction of the region with a decreasing trend of ir the area where the 20 mm decade 1downward trend in ir occurred consisted of four parts which in turn are the northern ncp southwest shandong the partial area of the southeastern ncp and the shandong peninsula fig 6 the change point detection was conducted with regard to ir in three seasons from 1981 to 2012 fig 8 in all records out of 236 meteorological stations there were 85 93 and 63 stations with statistically significant abrupt change points at the significance level of 5 for three seasons respectively additionally the time period of abrupt change and the spatial distribution of the corresponding stations among the three seasons were distinctly different a total of 55 stations mainly distributed in the northern and western ncp had abrupt changes in the winter wheat season between 1991 and 1995 however in the summer maize season the time interval of abrupt change was mostly concentrated from 2001 to 2007 and was later than that of mutation for winter wheat and the relevant sites located along the strip expanding from the southwestern ncp to the shandong peninsula in terms of the abrupt change in ir for the rotation cycle the change points were relatively normally distributed in different time intervals furthermore the trends of ir at more than 65 of stations continued to decline for the winter wheat and the rotation cycle after abrupt change in contrast approximately 70 of stations had an increasing trend in ir for summer maize after the mutation fig 9 3 4 spatial distribution of ir in dry and wet seasons the empirical frequency method recommended by fao 46 smith 1992 indicates that the corresponding rainfall with 80 and 20 probability of precipitation can be used as the thresholds to characterize the dry and wet seasons respectively the statistical results of the 236 stations in the ncp showed that the variability levels of the thresholds among different sites were moderate in two year types for all three seasons in general the variability of rainfall thresholds in the dry season was slightly higher than that in the wet season for the same growing season in addition the difference in rain thresholds for the winter wheat season was highest among all three seasons whether dry or wet fig 10 the spatial patterns of the ir for the three growing seasons in the dry and wet seasons were similar to those depicted in fig 6 only the magnitude of the ir in the same region was obviously different fig 11 compared to the multi year average status of the ir which is under 50 probability of precipitation the magnitude of the ir in the same region increased by approximately 50 50 and 100 mm in the dry season for the winter wheat the summer maize and the rotation cycle respectively although the ir decreased in the wet season up to 600 mm of ir was still needed for the rotation system in northern shandong and most parts of hebei 4 discussion the simplified water balance formula was adopted to estimate the ir in the ncp and this formula considers the crop coefficient reference evapotranspiration and effective rainfall in terms of the crop coefficient the results showed that a wide range of kcini existed for the same year due to the remarkable difference in the frequency and magnitude of precipitation and irrigation the surface soil properties and the duration of the initial stage among agro meteorological stations allen et al 1998 additionally kcmid and kcend for winter wheat and summer maize were relatively stable in terms of long term trends the reason for this result may be the low to moderate degree of variability of the mean wind speed and minimum relative humidity during the middle and late stages fig s3 although crop height is included in the formula the presence of a 0 3 exponent makes the result relatively insensitive to the small change in height such as the renewed varieties allen et al 1998 compared to the existing research the estimated values at the initial middle and late seasons for winter wheat and summer maize were reasonable and the differences were derived from the length of the initial stages i e the dormancy period was separated from the beginning or the methods used liu et al 2002 zhang et al 2011 zhao et al 2013 this study showed that the eto for the rotation system in the ncp had no significant trend from 1981 to 2012 however a previous study indicated that the eto in the huang huai hai region decreased by 19 56 mm decade 1 at the 0 05 significance level based the 0 5 0 5 gridded datasets during 1961 2013 wang et al 2017 however zhang et al 2019 fund that two completely inverse trends of eto were detected with significant downward trend of 14 91 mm decade 1 during 1970 1993 and significant upward trend of 16 50 mm decade 1 during 1993 2014 however the annual total eto had no distinct trend change since 1993 in the ncp the distinct results are likely attributed to the differences among the research period data type and boundary of study area especially the unstable attribution of climatic factors to eto over time fan and thomas 2018 moreover a downward trend for eto in the sub regions during the winter wheat season was indeed detected such as in the jing jin ji region the attribution analysis suggested that sunshine duration was the most influential factor to the significantly decreasing eto followed by the relative humidity and wind speed at a height of 2 m fig s4 the previous study showed that the higher pm2 5 concentration in this sub region has a significant negative effect on the eto in winter which indirectly demonstrated the dominant impact of radiation on eto yao 2017 furthermore wang et al 2017 indicated that the key element was the sunshine duration to variability of eto in the huang huai hai region almost in correspondence with the ncp with a relative contribution of 33 06 among several factors it should be noted that the increased reference evapotranspiration accompanied by decreased precipitation occurred in north of the yellow river especially in the jing jin ji region this phenomenon will exacerbate regional meteorological droughts vicente serrano et al 2010 the multi year average ir values in this study were 341 1 250 5 and 592 5 mm for the winter wheat the summer maize and the rotation cycle respectively the area with a large amount of ir was mainly located in most parts of the jing jin ji region and northern shandong although the long term tendency of ir is not evident for a single crop or for a rotation system a large amount of groundwater is consumed by winter wheat and summer maize annually yang et al 2010 sun et al 2010 2015 which leads to the continuous decline of the groundwater table by one metre per year in the ncp leng et al 2014 van oort et al 2016 the water table dropped rapidly as the extent and area of irrigation grew massively in the twentieth century turral et al 2011 especially for hebei and henan provinces fig s5 and this phenomenon has also been indicated by gong et al 2018 through groundwater retrieval based on the grace mascon solutions nevertheless areas with high ir such as the jing jin ji region still need to address water shortages and environmental issues in any case several studies at the site and regional scales have revealed that there is only limited or no more groundwater to support irrigated agriculture in the ncp chen et al 2003 shi et al 2011 to maintain the sustainable development of the region some adaptation strategies are necessary it is fully crucial to create new varieties with intensive tolerance to drought to consume less water and adjusting the cropping pattern may also be an effective approach e g reducing the area planted with winter wheat in the region of high ir mo et al 2017 5 conclusions crop coefficients at different growth stages of winter wheat and summer maize changed with time and space and exhibited low or moderate variability the multi year average values of kcini kcmid and kcend were 0 69 1 17 0 34 and 0 76 1 13 0 43 for the two crops respectively except for the complicated spatial distribution of the reference evapotranspiration and precipitation in the winter wheat season the region with decreased precipitation and increased reference evapotranspiration for the summer maize and the rotation cycle was located in the north of the yellow river especially in the jing jin ji region however to the south of the yellow river the spatial distribution pattern was nearly opposite the average irs in the ncp for the winter wheat the summer maize and the rotation cycle were 341 1 250 5 and 592 5 mm respectively furthermore the area with higher ir was mainly distributed in the jing jin ji region and northern shandong and the level of ir was remarkably aggravated in dry seasons additionally the ir increased in the northern ncp and the junction area between hebei and shandong and the ir in the rest of the area decreased with a trend of 10 mm decade 1 except for the winter wheat season acknowledgement this manuscript was supported by the projects of international cooperation and exchanges nsfc nsfc rcuk stfc grant number 61661136005

11154,the irrigation water requirement ir is crucial for optimizing agricultural water management and reallocation and for adjusting the planting structure based on the datasets derived from 277 meteorological stations and 42 agro meteorological stations from 1980 to 2012 the simplified water balance equation was employed to estimate the ir in the winter wheat summer maize rotation system the results indicated that for the two crops the crop coefficients varied with time and space at different growth stages with low or moderate variability levels the average values of kcini kcmid and kcend were 0 69 1 17 0 34 and 0 76 1 13 0 43 for winter wheat and summer maize respectively the region located to the most of northern parts of the yellow river had reduced precipitation and increased reference evapotranspiration eto during the rotation cycle moreover in the southern part of this region the precipitation increased significantly with distinctly decreased eto in the north china plain ncp the ir for the winter wheat summer maize and rotation cycle all had no significant trend change for which the multi year average values were 341 1 250 5 and 592 5 mm respectively the region with higher ir was primarily located in northern shandong and the most of northern parts of the yellow river where the ir level was remarkably aggravated in dry seasons additionally the ir increased in the northern ncp region and in the junction area between hebei and shandong and ir decreased with a trend of 10 mm decade 1 in other areas in addition the magnitude of the station and time intervals for

1 introduction currently climate change and freshwater scarcity have been viewed as the two most important global issues by scientists policymakers and even the public united nations environmental programme 2000 döll and stefan 2002 the global surface temperature increased by 0 85 c over the period from 1880 to 2012 which is in line with the intensified variability of precipitation ipcc 2013 additionally it should be noted that the substantial reduction in precipitation likely takes place in mid latitude regions where especially in asia surface and groundwater has been depleted to maintain the wide range of irrigation inducing severe environmental problems shi et al 2011 turral et al 2011 the predominant cropping pattern on the north china plain ncp is the winter wheat summer maize rotation system for which large amounts of total water consumption are utilized to contribute to 17 of the grain yield in the whole nation fig 1 yao 2017 however the ncp is affected by climatic warming and drying and the extent frequency and intensity of drought has increased in recent decades yuan et al 2015 chen and sun 2015 moreover because surface water is almost entirely reserved to supply industrial and domestic consumption there is no further exploitation potential for groundwater to fulfil production demands to avoid environmental and geological issues under current conditions sun et al 2010 shi et al 2011 inevitably the production of the double cropping system is influenced to some extent by water shortage induced by all of these inverse factors that threaten the water requirements for agriculture thus obtaining detailed knowledge of the spatial temporal variation in irrigation requirement for the winter wheat and summer maize rotation system under climate change is crucial for optimizing agricultural water management and reallocation and for adjusting the planting structure from the perspective of sustainable development which is a part of the policy termed as the national plan for sustainable development 2015 2030 that was approved by the state council of the people s republic of china npsd 2015 the irrigation water requirement ir is one of the most important parameters in irrigated agricultural systems and this value is distinct from the crop water requirement cwr which refers to the water supplemented by irrigation and the water conservancy infrastructure to ensure that the crop grows in its optimal water conditions savva and frenken 2002 overall approaches employed by previous research to estimate ir can generally be classified into two categories crop model and the direct adoption of field balance equation the former method drives crop models with a series of complicated parameters such as meteorological data genetic parameters and physical and hydrological properties ding et al 2017 döll and stefan 2002 there is no doubt that the superiority of crop models lies in characterizing the dynamics of crop development at the site scale nevertheless to ensure the accuracy of the simulated results precise parameterization and calibration are essential in addition operating models with limited field experimental data have difficulty effectively reflecting the spatial variability of ir due to large scale topographic heterogeneity yang et al 2010 ding et al 2017 the latter method obtains the magnitude of the ir as a function of the conservation of mass by considering the relevant parameters among these the cwr can be determined by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration eto by the crop coefficient which is termed as the crop coefficient method and is widely applied in studies of farmland and grassland ecosystems yang and zhou 2011 zhang et al 2012 marin et al 2016 based on the water balance method several studies related to ir have been performed for a variety of crops in different regions under the present and or future context in china zhu et al 2014 ding et al 2017 however to our knowledge almost all of these reports kept the crop coefficients of the different growth stages as constants over the entire study period in fact the crop coefficient is a variable that is determined by crop type climate soil evaporation and crop growth stage and the crop coefficient is used to distinguish typical field crops from the well watered grass reference allen et al 1998 in addition along with the dramatic variation in the precipitation status ipcc 2013 gaining deep insight into the spatial distribution of ir in different year types has very important significance then are there any distinct variations for irrigation requirement and its influence factor crop coefficient of the specific planting structure on the ncp in the last few decades under climate change as a consequence in our study considering that the crop coefficients of winter wheat and summer maize are influenced by biotic and abiotic factors the adjustment of crop coefficients in the corresponding growth stages must be carried out at each site and in each year for the two specific crops respectively subsequently the field water balance equation was used to detect the spatial temporal variability of the ir for the individual growing season and the double cropping system under the conditions of climate change in addition the spatial distribution patterns of the ir were displayed for the double cropping system in wet and dry years on the ncp the results were expected to identify the state of the ir and to serve as a reference for policymakers to propose relevant strategies for agriculture on the ncp 2 data and methods 2 1 study area located in the eastern part of china the ncp ranges from the latitudes of 32 08 n to 40 23 n and the longitudes of 112 51 e to 122 42 e with an area of 4 105 km2 that is covered by most areas of five provinces hebei henan shandong anhui and jiangsu and two cities beijing and tianjin moreover the ncp has an average elevation of 73 4 m above sea level fig 1 the region is dominated by a temperate monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature of 12 8 14 9 c and a mean annual precipitation of 472 7 889 2 mm of which approximately 70 occurs from june to september statistics during 1980 2012 the major provinces henan and shandong both have been facing with significant trend of decreasing of total water resources since the 21st century though the amount of total water resources in hebei province has no distinct trend change only about 1 8 1010 m3 of reserve water is far less than the average in the ncp fig s1 as the alluvial plain has mainly developed by the intermittent flooding of the yellow river loam and sandy loam textured soil are the primary soil types on the basis of the sampling of agro meteorological stations in the ncp fig 1 in addition the major cropping pattern is the winter wheat summer maize double cropping system generally the winter wheat is sown in early october in the previous year and harvested in early or mid june in the following year and the timing of sowing and harvesting for summer maize are at the end of may and september in the same year respectively 2 2 data source and quality control in this study there are three types of datasets used to estimate the ir including meteorological data crop data and soil hydrological and physical parameters collected by the national meteorological information centre of the china meteorological administration the detailed descriptions of the data screening are presented as follows the historical observed meteorological data consisting of the maximum temperature minimum temperature sunshine duration wind speed at a height of 10 m average relative humidity minimum relative humidity and precipitation on a daily timescale were obtained for the period from 1980 to 2012 at 443 stations due to missing data and site migration only these stations were employed after the following selection criteria were used in sequence 1 no missing data for each element within the entire month 2 migration distance of the station is less than 10 km relative to the original position and the elevation is no more than 200 m and 3 proportion of missing data for each element is controlled within 1 then these gaps were filled using the following strategies 1 linear interpolation when the number of consecutive missing data was 5 and substitution with the mean value of other years when the number of consecutive missing data was 5 for all variables except for precipitation and 2 replacement with the value on the same day based on the nearest meteorological station for only the precipitation data ultimately 277 meteorological stations had complete time series and were selected for analysis of which 236 stations were evenly distributed within the ncp and the remaining sites encompassed the region fig 1 based on the sunshine hours and wind speed at a height of 10 m the net radiation and wind speed at a height of 2 m were calculated by the methods suggested by the fao allen et al 1998 the crop data for the different crops such as the phenological phase plant height and irrigation volume were derived from 42 agro meteorological stations where winter wheat and summer maize were planted in cycles fig 1 the data records started from the planting of winter wheat in 1980 and ended with the harvesting of summer maize in 2012 however the number of sites available per rotation period varied over time from 1981 to 2012 as there were finite observed agro meteorological stations before the 1990s and patchy observation records fig 2 despite this the distribution of the agro meteorological stations was still relatively homogeneous even when there were only 15 stations in 1981 and 1982 in addition more than 26 stations could be used for the analysis in most of the rotation periods once performing the adjustment for the crop coefficients in specific agro meteorological stations the required meteorological data such as precipitation wind speed and minimum relative humidity were derived from each respective weather station or the nearest weather station five sites had no meteorological information the soil hydrological and physical parameters from 42 agro meteorological stations comprised the soil type field capacity θfc m3 m 3 and wilting point θwp m3 m 3 at a depth of 0 1 m which is recommended by the fao when the effective depth of the soil evaporation layer is unknown allen et al 1998 because the data length was only eight years i e 2003 2010 and because the soil parameters that were measured annually rarely changed between years the multi year average values for relevant parameters were adopted to represent the long term status of the soil property 2 3 adjustment for crop coefficients the growing periods of winter wheat and summer maize were separated into four distinct growth stages initial crop development mid season and late season based on the crop phenological information fig s2 the single crop coefficient approach was used to calculate the crop coefficients at three different stages allen et al 1998 1 k cini tew tew rew exp t w t 1 e so 1 rew tew rew tew t w e t omean t w t 1 e so e t omean 1 15 t w t 1 2 k

the late season stages respectively kcmid tab and kcend tab are the typical crop coefficients recommended by fao 56 in corresponding stages in sub humid climates rhmin 45 u2 2 m s 1 tew is calculated by θfc and θwp and is the total evaporable water from the surface soil layer mm rew is the readily evaporable water and refers to the typical value tabulated in fao 56 mm etomean is the average

a height of 2 m minimum relative humidity and crop height over the corresponding growth stages respectively notably the crop coefficient of winter wheat over the dormancy period was set to 0 4 kcdor tao et al 2003 then based on the kcini kcmid kcend and crop phenology period the daily crop coefficient could be computed by linear interpolation 2 4 irrigation water requirements following fao 46 the ir during the growing season is defined as the difference between the cwr and the effective rainfall smith 1992 in fact the method is applicable in the ncp where the ground water table is low in most areas shi et al 2011 when the water that is stored in the soil at the beginning of each individual growing season and the leaching requirements are ignored smith 1992 döll and stefan 2002 the ir is computed as 4 ir e t c p e e t c p e 0 e t c p e where ir is the daily irrigation water requirement mm day 1 etc is the daily crop water requirement mm day 1 and pe is the daily effective precipitation mm day 1 etc is the crop evapotranspiration under standard conditions and the value is determined at each meteorological station by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration by the crop coefficient derived from the nearest agro meteorological site 5 e t c k c e t o where kc is the daily crop coefficient as mentioned in section 2 3 and eto is the reference crop evapotranspiration

analysis abrupt change detection and mapping the coefficient of variation cv is adopted to describe the temporal variability of the relevant elements the variability levels were classified by cv 0 1 0 1 cv 1 0 and cv 1 0 as weak moderate or strong respectively ayantobo et al 2017 the annual time series of the relevant indices for the double cropping system were calculated at the site and regional scales the tendency rates of the annual indices were computed using linear trend by least squares for the study period fang et al 2016a furthermore the nonparametric mann kendall trend test was employed to characterize the significance of the trend for the time series due to its extensive application fang et al 2016b deng et al 2018 considering the possible impact on the result of the mann kendall trend test by the serial correlation of time series the pre whitening approach was applied before performing the test yue and wang 2002 deng et al 2018 the significance level α of the mann kendall trend test was set to 0 05 then the standard normal test statistic zs was computed by which a significant increasing trend exists in the time series if zs 1 96 and a significant decreasing trend exists in the time series if zs 1 96 if not there is no significant trend change abrupt change detection is used to check the possible change point of the time series that has an effect on the trend analysis results villarini et al 2012 gu et al 2017 in this study two methods detecting mutational points were used namely the mann kendall abrupt test and the 5 year moving t test the reason for using the latter simultaneously is that it helps to deal with the multiple point mutations after using the mann kendall abrupt test and ensures the accuracy of the test results fang et al 2016b similarly the level of significance was set to 0 05 a variety of techniques can be adopted to generate a continuous map to characterize the spatial distribution of relevant indices as the most commonly used interpolation methods the kriging method was utilized because of its ability to provide an unbiased estimation and fully reflect the spatial structure of the variables dong et al 2018 in addition all procedures were carried out using arcgis 10 0 software 3 results 3 1 inter annual variation in kc for winter wheat and summer maize with the help of climatic phenological and soil information the change characteristics of kc were captured at different growth stages for winter wheat and summer maize as shown in fig 3 for winter maize the multi year average kcini was 0 69 for which there was no significant linear trend and a moderate variability level from 1981 to 2012 meanwhile it can be seen that the kcini along with approximately 0 2 of the standard deviation varied from 0 12 to 1 15 among the different agro stations in the same year which is in accordance with the statement in fao 56 allen et al 1998 in addition the multi year average kcmid and kcend values were 1 17 and 0 34 respectively two values were slightly greater than the tabulated kc in the corresponding stages unlike the inter annual characteristics exhibited over kcini the variability levels of kcmid and kcend were extremely weak for winter wheat from 1981 to 2012 and there were only a few differences between sites for summer maize the multi year average kcini was 0 76 with weak variability level and no significant trend nevertheless the great distinction of kcini similar to that of kcini of the winter wheat existed between stations the multi year average values of kcmid and kcend were 1 13 and 0 43 respectively two of which were all less than the tabulated values of kc recommended by fao 56 allen et al 1998 similarly the variability of the kcmid and kcend of summer maize for the study period and between sites was small compared to that of winter wheat 3 2 spatial temporal variation of eto and precipitation based on the climatic elements of 236 meteorological stations distributed over the ncp the characteristics of eto and precipitation during the winter wheat season the summer maize season and the whole rotation cycle were detected the spatial distribution pattern of eto was generally coherent during the winter wheat season and the rotation cycle increasing gradually from southwest to northeast the bohai rim region however for the summer maize season it was found that the high value region was located along the strip extending from the mid west part of the ncp to the bohai rim region around which the eto decreased as the distance increased in addition a clear southeast northwest gradient of precipitation was detected over the ncp in all three seasons and only the magnitude of precipitation was distinct fig 4 as a whole the average total eto varied weakly and had no obvious trend change over time with multi year mean values of 538 8 402 0 and 940 8 mm for the winter wheat the summer maize and the rotation cycle respectively although significant linear trends of average total precipitation were not detected for the three seasons the inter annual variability was relatively large as all coefficients of variation were approximately 0 2 the multi year mean values of precipitation for the three seasons were 184 0 416 7 and 597 3 mm respectively fig 5 specifically there were remarkably disparate temporal variations in eto and precipitation over different areas among the three seasons fig 4 for eto an irregular spatial distribution of tendency was found in the winter wheat season over the ncp and the variation in most parts of the ncp displayed a downward trend apart from the northern and southeastern regions especially for the southwest and mid west of the ncp with a significant decreasing trend of at least 5 mm decade 1 it is noteworthy that a nearly similar spatial distribution trend of eto between the summer maize season and the rotation cycle was detected generally characterized by the boundary of the yellow river in both sides of which the change in eto showed an inverse tendency for precipitation most of the northern parts of the yellow river and the southern ncp had increasing trends of precipitation in the winter maize season and downward trends were displayed in other regions although the trend was not significant at the 0 05 significance level in contrast to the spatial pattern of the trend of eto presented over the ncp for the summer maize and the rotation cycle the spatial distribution of the trend of precipitation exhibited almost an opposite status in the corresponding seasons briefly in addition to the complicated spatial pattern of trends of eto and precipitation over the winter wheat season the state with stronger atmospheric evaporative demand and less precipitation was imposed in the regions such as the northern part of the yellow river especially in terms of the jing jin ji region beijing tianjin hebei of the ncp 3 3 spatial temporal variation and abrupt change in ir by combining kc and eto with precipitation together the ir was calculated for the winter wheat the summer maize and the rotation cycle respectively in terms of spatial variation of ir in the winter wheat season it gradually increased from the southwest to northeast and a high value centre was located around the bohai rim region where the ir reached 400 mm the spatial pattern of ir for summer maize was similar to that of eto in the same season with more than 250 mm of ir within the strip expanding from the bohai rim region to the mid west of the ncp where the ir in northern shandong was relatively high there was also a gradient of distribution of ir for the rotation cycle and approximately half of the ncp where the ir was usually higher than 600 mm consisted of the jing jin ji region and most parts of shandong and the high value centre of the ir was located in northern shandong fig 6 statistical results showed that the inter annual variation in the ir for the winter wheat the summer maize and the rotation cycle had no significant trends with zs values of 0 1 67 and 1 02 respectively from the mann kendall trend test the multi year average ir values were 341 1 250 5 and 592 5 mm for these three seasons respectively of which the moderate variability of ir existed in both winter wheat and summer maize seasons and the weak variability of ir only existed in the rotation cycle fig 7 nevertheless the distinct variability of ir trends was found among the three seasons in the different sub regions for winter wheat the regions with decreasing ir mainly occurred within two strips that extended from central hebei to the southwestern ncp and to the shandong peninsula the ir in the rest of the ncp showed an increasing trend for summer maize the partial region such as the northern ncp and the junction area between hebei and shandong had an increasing ir trend however it can be clearly found that the ir decreased with a trend of 10 mm decade 1in most of southern parts of the yellow river within which the ir in some regions including the southwestern ncp and the strip extending from southwestern shandong to the northeastern ncp decreased significantly by 20 mm decade 1 for the rotation cycle the overall spatial pattern of the trend in ir was similar to that of the trend in the summer maize season apart from a slight reduction of the region with a decreasing trend of ir the area where the 20 mm decade 1downward trend in ir occurred consisted of four parts which in turn are the northern ncp southwest shandong the partial area of the southeastern ncp and the shandong peninsula fig 6 the change point detection was conducted with regard to ir in three seasons from 1981 to 2012 fig 8 in all records out of 236 meteorological stations there were 85 93 and 63 stations with statistically significant abrupt change points at the significance level of 5 for three seasons respectively additionally the time period of abrupt change and the spatial distribution of the corresponding stations among the three seasons were distinctly different a total of 55 stations mainly distributed in the northern and western ncp had abrupt changes in the winter wheat season between 1991 and 1995 however in the summer maize season the time interval of abrupt change was mostly concentrated from 2001 to 2007 and was later than that of mutation for winter wheat and the relevant sites located along the strip expanding from the southwestern ncp to the shandong peninsula in terms of the abrupt change in ir for the rotation cycle the change points were relatively normally distributed in different time intervals furthermore the trends of ir at more than 65 of stations continued to decline for the winter wheat and the rotation cycle after abrupt change in contrast approximately 70 of stations had an increasing trend in ir for summer maize after the mutation fig 9 3 4 spatial distribution of ir in dry and wet seasons the empirical frequency method recommended by fao 46 smith 1992 indicates that the corresponding rainfall with 80 and 20 probability of precipitation can be used as the thresholds to characterize the dry and wet seasons respectively the statistical results of the 236 stations in the ncp showed that the variability levels of the thresholds among different sites were moderate in two year types for all three seasons in general the variability of rainfall thresholds in the dry season was slightly higher than that in the wet season for the same growing season in addition the difference in rain thresholds for the winter wheat season was highest among all three seasons whether dry or wet fig 10 the spatial patterns of the ir for the three growing seasons in the dry and wet seasons were similar to those depicted in fig 6 only the magnitude of the ir in the same region was obviously different fig 11 compared to the multi year average status of the ir which is under 50 probability of precipitation the magnitude of the ir in the same region increased by approximately 50 50 and 100 mm in the dry season for the winter wheat the summer maize and the rotation cycle respectively although the ir decreased in the wet season up to 600 mm of ir was still needed for the rotation system in northern shandong and most parts of hebei 4 discussion the simplified water balance formula was adopted to estimate the ir in the ncp and this formula considers the crop coefficient reference evapotranspiration and effective rainfall in terms of the crop coefficient the results showed that a wide range of kcini existed for the same year due to the remarkable difference in the frequency and magnitude of precipitation and irrigation the surface soil properties and the duration of the initial stage among agro meteorological stations allen et al 1998 additionally kcmid and kcend for winter wheat and summer maize were relatively stable in terms of long term trends the reason for this result may be the low to moderate degree of variability of the mean wind speed and minimum relative humidity during the middle and late stages fig s3 although crop height is included in the formula the presence of a 0 3 exponent makes the result relatively insensitive to the small change in height such as the renewed varieties allen et al 1998 compared to the existing research the estimated values at the initial middle and late seasons for winter wheat and summer maize were reasonable and the differences were derived from the length of the initial stages i e the dormancy period was separated from the beginning or the methods used liu et al 2002 zhang et al 2011 zhao et al 2013 this study showed that the eto for the rotation system in the ncp had no significant trend from 1981 to 2012 however a previous study indicated that the eto in the huang huai hai region decreased by 19 56 mm decade 1 at the 0 05 significance level based the 0 5 0 5 gridded datasets during 1961 2013 wang et al 2017 however zhang et al 2019 fund that two completely inverse trends of eto were detected with significant downward trend of 14 91 mm decade 1 during 1970 1993 and significant upward trend of 16 50 mm decade 1 during 1993 2014 however the annual total eto had no distinct trend change since 1993 in the ncp the distinct results are likely attributed to the differences among the research period data type and boundary of study area especially the unstable attribution of climatic factors to eto over time fan and thomas 2018 moreover a downward trend for eto in the sub regions during the winter wheat season was indeed detected such as in the jing jin ji region the attribution analysis suggested that sunshine duration was the most influential factor to the significantly decreasing eto followed by the relative humidity and wind speed at a height of 2 m fig s4 the previous study showed that the higher pm2 5 concentration in this sub region has a significant negative effect on the eto in winter which indirectly demonstrated the dominant impact of radiation on eto yao 2017 furthermore wang et al 2017 indicated that the key element was the sunshine duration to variability of eto in the huang huai hai region almost in correspondence with the ncp with a relative contribution of 33 06 among several factors it should be noted that the increased reference evapotranspiration accompanied by decreased precipitation occurred in north of the yellow river especially in the jing jin ji region this phenomenon will exacerbate regional meteorological droughts vicente serrano et al 2010 the multi year average ir values in this study were 341 1 250 5 and 592 5 mm for the winter wheat the summer maize and the rotation cycle respectively the area with a large amount of ir was mainly located in most parts of the jing jin ji region and northern shandong although the long term tendency of ir is not evident for a single crop or for a rotation system a large amount of groundwater is consumed by winter wheat and summer maize annually yang et al 2010 sun et al 2010 2015 which leads to the continuous decline of the groundwater table by one metre per year in the ncp leng et al 2014 van oort et al 2016 the water table dropped rapidly as the extent and area of irrigation grew massively in the twentieth century turral et al 2011 especially for hebei and henan provinces fig s5 and this phenomenon has also been indicated by gong et al 2018 through groundwater retrieval based on the grace mascon solutions nevertheless areas with high ir such as the jing jin ji region still need to address water shortages and environmental issues in any case several studies at the site and regional scales have revealed that there is only limited or no more groundwater to support irrigated agriculture in the ncp chen et al 2003 shi et al 2011 to maintain the sustainable development of the region some adaptation strategies are necessary it is fully crucial to create new varieties with intensive tolerance to drought to consume less water and adjusting the cropping pattern may also be an effective approach e g reducing the area planted with winter wheat in the region of high ir mo et al 2017 5 conclusions crop coefficients at different growth stages of winter wheat and summer maize changed with time and space and exhibited low or moderate variability the multi year average values of kcini kcmid and kcend were 0 69 1 17 0 34 and 0 76 1 13 0 43 for the two crops respectively except for the complicated spatial distribution of the reference evapotranspiration and precipitation in the winter wheat season the region with decreased precipitation and increased reference evapotranspiration for the summer maize and the rotation cycle was located in the north of the yellow river especially in the jing jin ji region however to the south of the yellow river the spatial distribution pattern was nearly opposite the average irs in the ncp for the winter wheat the summer maize and the rotation cycle were 341 1 250 5 and 592 5 mm respectively furthermore the area with higher ir was mainly distributed in the jing jin ji region and northern shandong and the level of ir was remarkably aggravated in dry seasons additionally the ir increased in the northern ncp and the junction area between hebei and shandong and the ir in the rest of the area decreased with a trend of 10 mm decade 1 except for the winter wheat season acknowledgement this manuscript was supported by the projects of international cooperation and exchanges nsfc nsfc rcuk stfc grant number 61661136005
