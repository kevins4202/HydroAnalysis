17955,cyanobacteria blooms and micropollutants e g antibiotics in source waters are two increasing environmental issues worldwide this study hypothesized that the coexisting antibiotics may possibly alter the efficiency of water treatment processes through affecting the physiological and biochemical characteristics of cyanobacterial cells a toxic strain of microcystis aeruginosa was exposed to the common antibiotic erythromycin ery at environmentally relevant concentrations then samples were collected on days 1 4 and 6 to assess the efficiency of potassium permanganate kmno4 in cyanobacteria oxidation the percentage of intact cells remained constant after treatment with 2 mg l 1 kmno4 in m aeruginosa samples dosed with 0 5 0 μg l 1 ery although 6 mg l 1 kmno4 could damage cyanobacterial cells its ability was considerably reduced as the concentrations of ery increased kmno4 oxidation degraded the intracellular microcystins mcs in all of the cyanobacterial samples even the samples with intact cells possibly resulting from the stimulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species ros the highest amounts of total mcs remained after oxidation with 2 and 6 mg l 1 kmno4 in 0 2 μg l 1 ery treated cyanobacterial samples which may be due to large amounts of mc production the 5 0 μg l 1 ery inhibited the growth of cyanobacterial cells and downregulated the expression of the mc synthesis gene mcyb which resulted in the lowest amounts of total mcs however it led to the highest concentration 4 6 μg l 1 of extracellular mcs after treatment with 2 mg l 1 kmno4 for 300 min generally this study indicates that the effectiveness of kmno4 oxidation in cyanobacteria treatment decreased when the concentration of ery increased hence the possible risks caused by the coexistence of cyanobacteria and antibiotics such as reduced efficiency of water treatment processes in cyanobacteria inactivation and degradation of the dissolved mcs need to be taken into account graphical abstract image 1 keywords cyanobacteria erythromycin potassium permanganate microcystins 1 introduction the frequent occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms such as the bloom formation of microcystis spp can seriously impair drinking water quality in particular microcystins mcs produced by microcystis spp primarily microcystis aeruginosa may induce severe liver injury in humans ueno et al 1996 codd et al 2005 meanwhile micropollutants e g antibiotics in source waters are becoming a growing environmental problem worldwide in recent years the amounts of antibiotics observed in freshwater bodies such as rivers and lakes have ranged from ng l 1 to μg l 1 in many countries tamtam et al 2008 homem et al 2014 wu et al 2016 as two continuously critical contaminants antibiotics may co occur with cyanobacteria in surface waters recent studies have shown that the growth membrane integrity toxin productivity and macromolecular biomarkers of m aeruginosa cells could be influenced by some types of micropollutants e g organic pesticides polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heavy metals in aquatic environments tsai 2015 martinez ruiz and martinez jeronimo 2018 zhang et al 2018 it has been reported that 0 02 0 2 mg l 1 nonylphenol np stimulated the cell growth of four selected m aeruginosa strains whereas it inhibited their growth at a dosage of 2 mg l 1 for the toxic strain m aeruginosa pcc7820 0 2 mg l 1 np induced the largest amount of intracellular mcs which was 75 higher than that in the control sample wang et al 2007 recently increasing studies have reported that antibiotic residuals in source waters also show a potential impact on the growth and toxin production of m aeruginosa cells liu et al 2016 rico et al 2018 a study by liu et al 2015 has documented that the physiological responses such as cell proliferation antioxidation activity and toxin release of m aeruginosa cells could be increased when they were exposed to 200 and 500 ng l 1 amoxicillin for instance the cell densities activity of superoxide dismutase and extracellular mcs of m aeruginosa samples treated with 500 ng l 1 amoxicillin for 7 days were increased by 8 75 and 85 respectively compared to the samples without amoxicillin therefore antibiotics of ambient concentrations may seriously affect the formation of cyanobacteria blooms and induce variations in cell characteristics it should be noted that these resulting changes in cyanobacteria cells may lead to other consequences it is generally the case that greater amounts of oxidants e g ozone and chlorine and prolonged times were required during water treatment when cyanobacteria biomass and their toxin production were enhanced hitzfeld et al 2000 zhang et al 2017 in addition the changes in cell morphology size distribution and surface properties may cause the neutralization of the zeta potential which could promote the coagulation of microcystis cells chen et al 2017 consequently this study hypothesizes that the potential changes in cyanobacterial cells caused by the coincident antibiotics in source waters will possibly affect the efficiency of the followed water treatment processes however to date studies on such possibilities and the underlying mechanisms are unknown in drinking water treatment plants there are various processes applied for cyanobacteria removal inactivation such as pre oxidation and coagulation zamyadi et al 2013 potassium permanganate kmno4 is applied as a common oxidant for cyanobacteria treatment because of its low cost simple operation and high efficiency li et al 2014 gong and chu 2018 in addition kmno4 oxidation is considered as an environmentally friendly process compared to the use of other oxidation processes e g ozonation and chlorination which may create undesirable disinfection by products dbps fang et al 2010 coral et al 2013 therefore kmno4 was selected as a model treatment process in this study in addition erythromycin ery was chosen in this study since ery and its derivatives are some of the most commonly used macrolide antibiotics in human medicine and veterinary practice its concentration detected in rivers lakes in china is generally from tens to hundreds ng l 1 xu et al 2014 ding et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 and the maximum concentration observed can even reach μg l 1 lin and tsai 2009 bu et al 2013 chen et al 2018 consequently the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the effects of a common antibiotic ery on the growth of m aeruginosa and their cell viability and associated toxin production 2 assess the subsequent influences on kmno4 oxidation in m aeruginosa treatment and 3 explore the possible mechanisms of the alteration in the effectiveness of m aeruginosa treatment by kmno4 when the cells were pre exposed to ery 2 materials and methods 2 1 cell culture a toxic strain of m aeruginosa fachb 905 was provided by the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences china the

an incubation time of 7 min in the dark before analysis 2 6 reactive oxygen species ros generation test reactive oxygen species ros are common by products of oxidative metabolism in aerobic organisms the unpaired electron in ros makes them highly reactive which may influence the modulation of the antioxidant systems and increase cellular damage such as lipid peroxidation lpo and dna damage and repair gechev et al 2006 almeida et al 2017 the formation of intracellular ros in m aeruginosa cells was assessed by 2 7 dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate h2dcfda sigma aldrich usa h2dcfda can be hydrolyzed into 2 7 dichlorodihydrofluorescein h2dcf by the cellular esterase and it can remain in the cells the non fluorescent h2dcf can be transformed to the highly fluorescent 2 7 dichlorofluorescein dcf due to the effects of ros oukarroum et al 2012 cyanobacterial samples with a volume of 5 ml were collected at the time intervals of 0 and 5 min in the kmno4 oxidation

2016 tang et al 2018 2 7 gene expression test two genes mcyb and mcyh were selected in this study to evaluate mc production and transport in m aeruginosa cells mcyb and mcyh are the genes involved in the synthesis and transport of mcs respectively aro et al 1993 shao et al 2013 bi et al 2016 mcyb is one of the gene encoding peptide synthetases and mcyh has been hypothesized as the gene responsible for mc export in m aeruginosa which is involved in encoding the atp binding cassette abc transporter pearson et al 2004 the expression of the two genes in m aeruginosa fachb 905 under ery exposure on day 4 96 h was determined by real time rt pcr each ery treated 0 5 0 μg l 1 sample 100 ml was collected for rna isolation total rna was extracted by the plant total rna purification kit tr02 gmbiolab china after cells were ground under liquid nitrogen for reverse transcription 500 ng total rna was mixed with the random primers p dn 9 and reverse transcriptase according to high capacity cdna reverse transcription kits 4368814 abi usa the pcr amplification reactions were performed by mastercycler ep realplex eppendorf germany under the following conditions 1 cycle at 95 c for 3 min followed by 40 cycles at 95 c for 5 s 60 c for 15 s and 95 c for 15 s the pcr primers of mcyb and mcyh used in this study are listed in table 1 the rpod gene was used as the housekeeping gene to normalize the expression levels of target genes gene expression data were evaluated using ct values the induction ratio was calculated using 2 δδct livak and schmittgen 2001 where δδct cttarget gene

sds of three replications for each treatment were calculated one way anova was performed by prism 7 0 software to determine whether there was a statistically significant difference between different treatments 3 results 3 1 cell proliferation and membrane integrity the cell densities of m aeruginosa samples gradually increased during the cultivation time where the initial ery concentrations of 0 0 2 1 0 and 5 0 μg l 1 were spiked fig 1 a the cell density in e control 0 μg l 1 ery increased from 4 9 105 day 0 to 6 7 106 cells ml 1 day 6 for ery treated samples the cell density in ery 0 2 was 16 higher than that in e control on day 4 p 0 05 the cell density in ery 1 was increased to 7 4 106 cells ml 1 on day 6 which was 10 higher than that in e control p 0 05 in comparison the cell density in ery 5 was significantly lower than that in e control p 0 05 at all sampling times the cell density in ery 5 was only 2 1 106 cells ml 1 on day 6 which was 69 lower than that in e control the cell densities observed in m aeruginosa samples treated with ery 0 5 0 μg l 1 on days 1 4 and 6 were applied as the initial cell densities in the kmno4 oxidation experiments fig 1a cell densities of m aeruginosa cultures were detected at the final sampling time 300 min in the kmno4 oxidation experiments fig 1b and c in general the cell densities in all of the m aeruginosa samples collected on days 1 and 6 remained fairly constant after treatment with 2 mg l 1 kmno4 for 300 min compared to densities at 0 min fig 1b however there was a slight decrease in cell density in m aeruginosa samples on day 4 after oxidation with 2 mg l 1 kmno4 for instance the cell density in e control on day 4 decreased from 2 9 106 to 2 7 106 cells ml 1 when treated with 2 mg l 1 kmno4 generally slight reductions in cell densities caused by 6 mg l 1 kmno4 were detected for m aeruginosa samples collected on days 1 4 and 6 fig 1c the cell densities in e control decreased from 7 0 105 to 5 9 105 cells ml 1 on day 1 from 2 9 106 to 2 7 106 cells ml 1 on day 4 and from 6 7 106 to 6 5 106 cells ml 1 on day 6 after treatment with 6 mg l 1 kmno4 however the degree of cell decline reduced as the concentration of ery increased for example after oxidation with 6 mg l 1 kmno4 the cell density in ery 5 decreased from 5 9 105 to 5 2 105 cells ml 1 for samples collected on day 1 m aeruginosa samples exposed to ery 0 5 0 μg l 1 on days 1 4 and 6 were chosen to analyze membrane integrity prior to oxidation with kmno4 the percentage of intact cells in samples dosed with ery 0 2 5 0 μg l 1 were similar to that in e control which implies the ery doses applied in this study have a negligible influence on cyanobacterial cell integrity table s1 the analysis showed that the membrane integrity for all of the m aeruginosa samples collected on day 1 remained fairly constant after the addition of 2 mg l 1 kmno4 for 300 min compared to 0 min fig 2 a in contrast a higher dose 6 mg l 1 of kmno4 led to a loss of membrane integrity in m aeruginosa samples with 0 0 2 and 1 0 μg l 1 ery fig 2b in general the degree of cyanobacterial cellular damage decreased when the concentration of ery increased for instance the percentages of intact cells in e control ery 0 2 and ery 1 were approximately 95 and then dropped significantly to 53 61 and 74 respectively after treatment with 6 mg l 1 kmno4 for 180 min fig 2b there was no obvious membrane loss detected in m aeruginosa samples exposure to 5 0 μg l 1 ery during oxidation with 6 mg l 1 kmno4 similar trends were observed in m aeruginosa samples collected on days 4 and 6 while the degree of cell inactivation caused by kmno4 was reduced compared to the corresponding samples on day 1 table s1 3 2 microcystin degradation and gene expression the m aeruginosa cultures dosed with 0 5 0 μg l 1 ery for 4 days underwent measurement for mcs fig 3 the concentration of total mcs in e control without ery decreased from 82 9 to 55 5 μg l 1 reduction of 33 after oxidation with 2 mg l 1 kmno4 for 300 min fig 3a the amount of total mcs detected in ery 0 2 was 93 0 μg l 1 at the initial time 0 min and then decreased to 76 6 μg l 1 after oxidation with 2 mg l 1 kmno4 for 300 min a relatively lower initial mc concentration 59 1 μg l 1 was observed in ery 5 and it decreased to 40 6 μg l 1 reduction of 29 during treatment with kmno4 for 300 min the majority of mcs were intracellular for all of the cyanobacterial samples at the initial time of oxidation with kmno4 fig 3 the concentrations of intracellular mcs remained constant in the first 35 min and were degraded steadily to 300 min in all three ery exposed experiments the initial concentrations of extracellular mcs in e control and ery 0 2 was 5 6 and 5 1 μg l 1 respectively while ery 5 contained a higher concentration 11 8 μg l 1 of extracellular mcs the amounts of extracellular mcs were degraded quickly in the first 5 min of kmno4 oxidation for all of the samples and were barely detectable after 300 min in e control and ery 0 2 however for ery 5 the concentration of extracellular mcs remained steady approximately 4 0 μg l 1 during the subsequent oxidation a similar tendency was observed for the change in total mcs caused by 6 mg l 1 kmno4 fig 3b while larger amounts of total mcs were oxidized by kmno4 for all of the samples the concentration of total mcs in e control was decreased from 78 5 to 40 4 μg l 1 reduction of 49 after 300 min of oxidation with kmno4 the concentration of total mcs in ery 0 2 was 81 6 μg l 1 at the initial time and then dropped to 52 5 μg l 1 after 300 min which was still higher than that in e control for ery 5 the concentration of total mcs was reduced from 42 8 to 23 8 μg l 1 reduction of 29 by oxidation with kmno4 for 300 min the initial concentrations of intracellular mcs in e control and ery 0 2 were 72 9 and 74 4 μg l 1 respectively and degraded gradually to 39 2 and 50 7 μg l 1 from 0 to 300 min respectively while in ery 5 it remained constant approximately 33 0 μg l 1 during 35 min and was degraded to 23 0 μg l 1 during subsequent time till 300 min the initial concentration of extracellular mcs in e control ery 0 2 and ery 5 was 5 6 7 2 and 8 8 μg l 1 respectively the degradation trend of these extracellular mcs was similar to that in the first 5 min of treatment with 2 mg l 1 kmno4 however these mcs were barely detectable from 5 to 65 min in e control and ery 0 2 while they increased to 1 19 and 1 86 μg l 1 at 300 min respectively for ery 5 the extracellular mcs oxidized by 6 mg l 1 kmno4 was approximately 1 μg l 1 from 0 to 65 min and 1 μg l 1 at 300 min gene expression of m aeruginosa cultures dosed with 0 5 0 μg l 1 ery for 4 days was tested in order to explore mc production mcyb and transportation mcyh in m aeruginosa cells affected by ery fig 4 gene expression was not obviously modified by 0 2 μg l 1 ery p 0 05 however the expression of mcyb and mcyh were significantly upregulated by 1 0 μg l 1 ery while slightly downregulated by 5 0 μg l 1 ery p 0 05 3 3 intracellular ros levels intracellular ros levels of m aeruginosa cells dosed with ery 0 5 0 μg l 1 were evaluated at the initial 0 min and after a short time 5 min of oxidation with kmno4 fig 5 the intracellular ros levels in m aeruginosa samples collected on days 1 4 and 6 are expressed as the fold induction compared to that in e control on the same day at the initial oxidation time e control was equal to 1 ros level 1 represents stimulation ros level 1 represents inhabitation for the initial oxidation time there was no significantly differences between e control ery 0 2 and ery 5 on days 1 4 and 6 the intracellular ros production in m aeruginosa cells on day 1 was significantly stimulated by 1 0 μg l 1 ery p 0 05 with an intracellular ros level of 1 8 however there was no obvious difference in ros values between ery 1 and e control on days 4 and 6 p 0 05 for the short treatment time 5 min with 2 mg l 1 kmno4 the intracellular ros levels were higher than those at the initial time for all samples on the three days fig 5 the intracellular ros levels in e control were approximately 3 1 on the three days the ros levels in ery 0 2 and ery 1 on days 1 and 6 after 5 min of oxidation with kmno4 were higher than that in e control the highest levels of intracellular ros were detected in ery 5 with values of 11 9 day 1 4 9 day 4 and 4 7 day 6 for a higher dose 6 mg l 1 of kmno4 after 5 min of treatment the intracellular ros levels in e control were 8 7 9 1 and 10 5 on days 1 4 and 6 respectively which were considerably higher than samples treated with 2 mg l 1 kmno4 fig 5 the intracellular ros level of ery 0 2 was 19 1 which was significantly higher than that of the other samples on day 1 p 0 05 the intracellular ros levels in ery 1 and ery 5 collected on day 1 were approximately 9 3 which was similar to that of the e control however the intracellular ros levels in ery treated samples on day 4 were lower than e control with values of 6 2 ery 0 2 6 0 ery 1 and 4 9 ery 5 4 discussion 4 1 the effects of ery on the characteristics of m aeruginosa cells cyanobacteria which are similar to bacteria stanier and cohen bazire 1977 have been reported as cells that are sensitive to various antibiotics van der grinten et al 2010 rico et al 2018 in this study the cell growth of m aeruginosa was stimulated by ery at a low concentration 0 2 μg l 1 while it was inhibited at a high concentration 5 0 μg l 1 these findings are in agreement with a previous study which observed that the growth of microcystis flos aquae was stimulated by 0 001 0 1 μg l 1 ery but was inhibited by ery concentrations higher than 10 μg l 1 wan et al 2015 this phenomenon could be explained as hormesis which means that organisms can have a stimulatory response when they are exposed to low doses of substances but have a deleterious response caused by high doses of the same substances crump 2001 the concentration of total mcs in e control was lower than that in ery 0 2 but was higher than in ery 5 fig 3 considering the similar tendency observed in the results of cell growth fig 1 the cell density of cyanobacteria could be likely to positively correlate with the production of total mcs wang et al 2007 in the gene test 5 0 μg l 1 ery was observed to inhibit mc production where the gene expression of mcyb related to mc production was downregulated fig 4 this might be another reason that the concentration of total mcs in ery 5 was considerably lower than that in e control there was a highest concentration of extracellular mcs in ery 5 however the mc transport gene mcyh was downregulated and the membrane integrity was unaffected hence the increase in extracellular mcs might be attributed to the release of mcs as a response by cyanobacteria against environmental stresses tsai 2015 in the treatment with 0 2 μg l 1 ery the gene expression related to mc production mcyb and mc transportation mcyh were not obviously modified fig 4 this indicates that the stimulation of cell growth may be the major factor for the increase of total mcs in the m aeruginosa samples treated with a low concentration of ery in this study an ery concentration of 0 2 μg l 1 was similar to that documented by liu et al 2015 in which 0 2 and 0 5 μg l 1 amoxicillin stimulated both cell proliferation and production of total mcs in m aeruginosa thus antibiotics with environmentally relevant concentrations may promote the cell growth of cyanobacteria and increase environmental risk by enhancing the production of total mcs to some extent higher concentrations e g 5 0 μg l 1 of ery may have negative effects on their cell growth and production of total mcs this finding agreed with a previous study which illustrated that high concentrations of np could inhibit both cell proliferation and production of mcs wang et al 2007 however a higher concentration of extracellular mcs was detected in ery 5 compared with that in e control fig 3a which indicated that the possible risks caused by higher concentrations of antibiotics in source waters should be also taken into account 4 2 the effectiveness of kmno4 on m aeruginosa samples dosed with ery previous studies have demonstrated that oxidation with kmno4 can efficiently remove antibiotics or cyanobacteria hu et al 2010 fan et al 2013 for treatment with 2 mg l 1 kmno4 both the cell density and integrity of m aeruginosa samples with without ery remained constant after 300 min figs 1b and 2 this agrees with a previous study which revealed that 98 of the m aeruginosa cells were intact and the cell densities remained fairly constant at low concentration kmno4 below 3 mg l 1 treatments for 6 h fan et al 2013 although the cyanobacterial cells were generally intact after treatment with 2 mg l 1 kmno4 for 300 min the intracellular mcs in all of the samples were obviously degraded the decrease of intracellular mcs in the intact cells was also observed in e control and ery 0 2 during treatment with 6 mg l 1 kmno4 for 65 min one possible reason is that kmno4 could enter through the cyanobacterial membrane and degrade the intracellular mcs which was also mentioned by fan et al 2013 the increased levels of intracellular ros observed on day 4 approximately 3 1 4 9 and 4 9 9 0 during treatments with 2 and 6 mg l 1 kmno4 respectively also implied kmno4 might enter into cyanobacterial cells and further degrade the intracellular toxins fig 5 this agrees with wang et al 2015 who found that the diffusion of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 into m aeruginosa cells could lead to an increase in the intracellular ros levels alternatively the increasing level of ros might be a cellular response of m aeruginosa cells against oxidation with kmno4 which further degrades the intracellular mcs tang et al 2018 although the extracellular mcs were hardly detectable in 0 and 0 2 μg l 1 ery treated cyanobacterial samples after oxidation with 2 mg l 1 kmno4 for 300 min they could still be detected 4 6 μg l 1 in ery 5 it may be that the residual kmno4 in the m aeruginosa samples dosed with 5 0 μg l 1 ery was inadequate to oxidize the extracellular mcs fig s1 the water quality value for mc lr in drinking water guidelines recommended by the world health organization who 2011 is 1 μg l 1 this study suggests that there might be a risk of treatment with low dose kmno4 below 2 mg l 1 when high concentrations of ery coexist with m aeruginosa cells in raw waters therefore larger amounts of oxidants might be required under this situation previous study has also shown that higher chlorine doses were demanded to oxidize the cyanotoxins in raw water lake greifensee with complex chemical composition rodriguez et al 2007 thus micropollutants such as antibiotics could significantly affect the efficiency of water treatment processes the cell integrity of m aeruginosa samples dosed with 0 1 0 μg l 1 ery for 1 day could be significantly destroyed during treatment with 6 mg l 1 kmno4 from 65 to 300 min fig 2b while the cell densities kept relatively constant fig 1c wert et al 2013 have also reported that m aeruginosa cells were devitalized after oxidation by chlorine and chlorine dioxide but the cell numbers remained stable as the cell membranes were not completely fragmented therefore oxidants could damage cyanobacterial cells in a short time but their ability might be not strong enough to breakdown the cells completely this study revealed that the cellular damage effect of kmno4 decreased with the growing culture time of cyanobacterial samples from day 1 6 table s1 it was a common consequence of higher oxidant demand consumed by a higher cell density of cyanobacteria lin et al 2009 fan et al 2018 the extracellular mcs in the m aeruginosa samples dosed with 0 5 0 μg l 1 ery were hardly detectable when oxidized by 6 mg l 1 kmno4 for 65 min however concentrations of extracellular mcs above 1 μg l 1 were observed in e control and ery 0 2 at 300 min after oxidation with kmno4 possibly attributing to further cell lysis fig 2 and may pose a health risk to humans for ery 5 the extracellular mcs were degraded steadily from initial time to 300 min with the membrane integrity of m aeruginosa cells nearly unaffected the impact of kmno4 on cyanobacterial cell rupture decreased with increasing ery concentration fig 2 which may be due to the scavenging effect of ery on kmno4 fig s1 the effects of ery on oxidation of total mcs was positively correlated with its effects on cellular damage by 6 mg l 1 kmno4 where the order of total mc reduction was ery 5 19 0 μg l 1 ery 0 2 29 1 μg l 1 e control 38 1 μg l 1 fig 3b these results indicated that the micropollutant antibiotics in source waters may significantly reduce the efficiency of kmno4 in cyanobacterial cell inactivation and the associated toxin degradation 5 conclusions the cell growth of cyanobacteria and associated production of total mcs could be promoted by a micropollutant such as ery at an environmentally relevant concentration 0 2 μg l 1 the extracellular mcs in the m aeruginosa cells pre exposed to 0 2 μg l 1 ery were hardly detectable within intact cells during treatment with 2 mg l 1 kmno4 however 6 mg l 1 kmno4 caused cellular damage in m aeruginosa samples dosed with 0 2 μg l 1 ery which led to a concentration of extracellular mcs higher than the safe guideline 1 μg l 1 proposed by the who high concentration of ery 5 0 μg l 1 had a negative impact on the growth and mc production of m aeruginosa cells the decrease in mc production may be attributed to the downregulation of expression of the mc synthesis gene mcyb although the mc transport gene mcyh was also downregulated by 5 0 μg l 1 ery the highest concentration of extracellular mcs was observed with this treatment kmno4 at a concentration of 2 mg l 1 was inadequate in completely oxidizing the extracellular mcs in general the efficiency of oxidation with kmno4 was reduced with increasing ery concentration it was not only due to the consumption of kmno4 by ery but also attributed to the effects of ery on the alteration of the proliferation and toxin production of m aeruginosa cells declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17955,cyanobacteria blooms and micropollutants e g antibiotics in source waters are two increasing environmental issues worldwide this study hypothesized that the coexisting antibiotics may possibly alter the efficiency of water treatment processes through affecting the physiological and biochemical characteristics of cyanobacterial cells a toxic strain of microcystis aeruginosa was exposed to the common antibiotic erythromycin ery at environmentally relevant concentrations then samples were collected on days 1 4 and 6 to assess the efficiency of potassium permanganate kmno4 in cyanobacteria oxidation the percentage of intact cells remained constant after treatment with 2 mg l 1 kmno4 in m aeruginosa samples dosed with 0 5 0 μg l 1 ery although 6 mg l 1 kmno4 could damage cyanobacterial cells its ability was considerably reduced as the concentrations of ery increased kmno4 oxidation degraded the intracellular microcystins mcs in all of the cyanobacterial samples even the samples with intact cells possibly resulting from the stimulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species ros the highest amounts of total mcs remained after oxidation with 2 and 6 mg l 1 kmno4 in 0 2 μg l 1 ery treated cyanobacterial samples which may be due to large amounts of mc production the 5 0 μg l 1 ery inhibited the growth of cyanobacterial cells and downregulated the expression of the mc synthesis gene mcyb which resulted in the lowest amounts of total mcs however it led to the highest concentration 4 6 μg l 1 of extracellular mcs after treatment with 2 mg l 1 kmno4 for 300 min generally this study indicates that the effectiveness of kmno4 oxidation in cyanobacteria treatment decreased when the concentration of ery increased hence the possible risks caused by the coexistence of cyanobacteria and antibiotics such as reduced efficiency of water treatment processes in cyanobacteria inactivation and degradation of the dissolved mcs need to be taken into account graphical abstract image 1 keywords cyanobacteria erythromycin potassium permanganate microcystins 1 introduction the frequent occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms such as the bloom formation of microcystis spp can seriously impair drinking water quality in particular microcystins mcs produced by microcystis spp primarily microcystis aeruginosa may induce severe liver injury in humans ueno et al 1996 codd et al 2005 meanwhile micropollutants e g antibiotics in source waters are becoming a growing environmental problem worldwide in recent years the amounts of antibiotics observed in freshwater bodies such as rivers and lakes have ranged from ng l 1 to μg l 1 in many countries tamtam et al 2008 homem et al 2014 wu et al 2016 as two continuously critical contaminants antibiotics may co occur with cyanobacteria in surface waters recent studies have shown that the growth membrane integrity toxin productivity and macromolecular biomarkers of m aeruginosa cells could be influenced by some types of micropollutants e g organic pesticides polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heavy metals in aquatic environments tsai 2015 martinez ruiz and martinez jeronimo 2018 zhang et al 2018 it has been reported that 0 02 0 2 mg l 1 nonylphenol np stimulated the cell growth of four selected m aeruginosa strains whereas it inhibited their growth at a dosage of 2 mg l 1 for the toxic strain m aeruginosa pcc7820 0 2 mg l 1 np induced the largest amount of intracellular mcs which was 75 higher than that in the control sample wang et al 2007 recently increasing studies have reported that antibiotic residuals in source waters also show a potential impact on the growth and toxin production of m aeruginosa cells liu et al 2016 rico et al 2018 a study by liu et al 2015 has documented that the physiological responses such as cell proliferation antioxidation activity and toxin release of m aeruginosa cells could be increased when they were exposed to 200 and 500 ng l 1 amoxicillin for instance the cell densities activity of superoxide dismutase and extracellular mcs of m aeruginosa samples treated with 500 ng l 1 amoxicillin for 7 days were increased by 8 75 and 85 respectively compared to the samples without amoxicillin therefore antibiotics of ambient concentrations may seriously affect the formation of cyanobacteria blooms and induce variations in cell characteristics it should be noted that these resulting changes in cyanobacteria cells may lead to other consequences it is generally the case that greater amounts of oxidants e g ozone and chlorine and prolonged times were required during water treatment when cyanobacteria biomass and their toxin production were enhanced hitzfeld et al 2000 zhang et al 2017 in addition the changes in cell morphology size distribution and surface properties may cause the neutralization of the zeta potential which could promote the coagulation of microcystis cells chen et al 2017 consequently this study hypothesizes that the potential changes in cyanobacterial cells caused by the coincident antibiotics in source waters will possibly affect the efficiency of the followed water treatment processes however to date studies on such possibilities and the underlying mechanisms are unknown in drinking water treatment plants there are various processes applied for cyanobacteria removal inactivation such as pre oxidation and coagulation zamyadi et al 2013 potassium permanganate kmno4 is applied as a common oxidant for cyanobacteria treatment because of its low cost simple operation and high efficiency li et al 2014 gong and chu 2018 in addition kmno4 oxidation is considered as an environmentally friendly process compared to the use of other oxidation processes e g ozonation and chlorination which may create undesirable disinfection by products dbps fang et al 2010 coral et al 2013 therefore kmno4 was selected as a model treatment process in this study in addition erythromycin ery was chosen in this study since ery and its derivatives are some of the most commonly used macrolide antibiotics in human medicine and veterinary practice its concentration detected in rivers lakes in china is generally from tens to hundreds ng l 1 xu et al 2014 ding et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 and the maximum concentration observed can even reach μg l 1 lin and tsai 2009 bu et al 2013 chen et al 2018 consequently the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the effects of a common antibiotic ery on the growth of m aeruginosa and their cell viability and associated toxin production 2 assess the subsequent influences on kmno4 oxidation in m aeruginosa treatment and 3 explore the possible mechanisms of the alteration in the effectiveness of m aeruginosa treatment by kmno4 when the cells were pre exposed to ery 2 materials and methods 2 1 cell culture a toxic strain of m aeruginosa fachb 905 was provided by the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences china the

an incubation time of 7 min in the dark before analysis 2 6 reactive oxygen species ros generation test reactive oxygen species ros are common by products of oxidative metabolism in aerobic organisms the unpaired electron in ros makes them highly reactive which may influence the modulation of the antioxidant systems and increase cellular damage such as lipid peroxidation lpo and dna damage and repair gechev et al 2006 almeida et al 2017 the formation of intracellular ros in m aeruginosa cells was assessed by 2 7 dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate h2dcfda sigma aldrich usa h2dcfda can be hydrolyzed into 2 7 dichlorodihydrofluorescein h2dcf by the cellular esterase and it can remain in the cells the non fluorescent h2dcf can be transformed to the highly fluorescent 2 7

2016 tang et al 2018 2 7 gene expression test two genes mcyb and mcyh were selected in this study to evaluate mc production and transport in m aeruginosa cells mcyb and mcyh are the genes involved in the synthesis and transport of mcs respectively aro et al 1993 shao et al 2013 bi et al 2016 mcyb is one of the gene encoding peptide synthetases and mcyh has been hypothesized as the gene responsible for mc export in m aeruginosa which is involved in encoding the atp binding cassette abc transporter pearson et al 2004 the expression of the two genes in m aeruginosa fachb 905 under ery exposure on day 4 96 h was determined by real time rt pcr each ery treated 0 5 0 μg l 1 sample 100 ml was collected for rna isolation total rna was extracted by the plant total rna purification kit tr02 gmbiolab china after cells were ground under liquid nitrogen for reverse transcription 500 ng total rna was mixed with the random primers p dn 9 and reverse transcriptase according to high capacity cdna

sds of three replications for each treatment were calculated one way anova was performed by prism 7 0 software to determine whether there was a statistically significant difference between different treatments 3 results 3 1 cell proliferation and membrane integrity the cell densities of m aeruginosa samples gradually increased during the cultivation time where the initial ery concentrations of 0 0 2 1 0 and 5 0 μg l 1 were spiked fig 1 a the cell density in e control 0 μg l 1 ery increased from 4 9 105 day 0 to 6 7 106 cells ml 1 day 6 for ery treated samples the cell density in ery 0 2 was 16 higher than that in e control on day 4 p 0 05 the cell density in ery 1 was increased to 7 4 106 cells ml 1 on day 6 which was 10 higher than that in e control p 0 05 in comparison the cell density in ery 5 was significantly lower than that in e control p 0 05 at all sampling times the cell density in ery 5 was only 2 1 106 cells ml 1 on day 6 which was 69 lower than that in e control the cell densities observed in m aeruginosa samples treated with ery 0 5 0 μg l 1 on days 1 4 and 6 were applied as the initial cell densities in the kmno4 oxidation experiments fig 1a cell densities of m aeruginosa cultures were detected at the final sampling time 300 min in the kmno4 oxidation experiments fig 1b and c in general the cell densities in all of the m aeruginosa samples collected on days 1 and 6 remained fairly constant after treatment with 2 mg l 1 kmno4 for 300 min compared to densities at 0 min fig 1b however there was a slight decrease in cell density in m aeruginosa samples on day 4 after oxidation with 2 mg l 1 kmno4 for instance the cell density in e control on day 4 decreased from 2 9 106 to 2 7 106 cells ml 1 when treated with 2 mg l 1 kmno4 generally slight reductions in cell densities caused by 6 mg l 1 kmno4 were detected for m aeruginosa samples collected on days 1 4 and 6 fig 1c the cell densities in e control decreased from 7 0 105 to 5 9 105 cells ml 1 on day 1 from 2 9 106 to 2 7 106 cells ml 1 on day 4 and from 6 7 106 to 6 5 106 cells ml 1 on day 6 after treatment with 6 mg l 1 kmno4 however the degree of cell decline reduced as the concentration of ery increased for example after oxidation with 6 mg l 1 kmno4 the cell density in ery 5 decreased from 5 9 105 to 5 2 105 cells ml 1 for samples collected on day 1 m aeruginosa samples exposed to ery 0 5 0 μg l 1 on days 1 4 and 6 were chosen to analyze membrane integrity prior to oxidation with kmno4 the percentage of intact cells in samples dosed with ery 0 2 5 0 μg l 1 were similar to that in e control which implies the ery doses applied in this study have a negligible influence on cyanobacterial cell integrity table s1 the analysis showed that the membrane integrity for all of the m aeruginosa samples collected on day 1 remained fairly constant after the addition of 2 mg l 1 kmno4 for 300 min compared to 0 min fig 2 a in contrast a higher dose 6 mg l 1 of kmno4 led to a loss of membrane integrity in m aeruginosa samples with 0 0 2 and 1 0 μg l 1 ery fig 2b in general the degree of cyanobacterial cellular damage decreased when the concentration of ery increased for instance the percentages of intact cells in e control ery 0 2 and ery 1 were approximately 95 and then dropped significantly to 53 61 and 74 respectively after treatment with 6 mg l 1 kmno4 for 180 min fig 2b there was no obvious membrane loss detected in m aeruginosa samples exposure to 5 0 μg l 1 ery during oxidation with 6 mg l 1 kmno4 similar trends were observed in m aeruginosa samples collected on days 4 and 6 while the degree of cell inactivation caused by kmno4 was reduced compared to the corresponding samples on day 1 table s1 3 2 microcystin degradation and gene expression the m aeruginosa cultures dosed with 0 5 0 μg l 1 ery for 4 days underwent measurement for mcs fig 3 the concentration of total mcs in e control without ery decreased from 82 9 to 55 5 μg l 1 reduction of 33 after oxidation with 2 mg l 1 kmno4 for 300 min fig 3a the amount of total mcs detected in ery 0 2 was 93 0 μg l 1 at the initial time 0 min and then decreased to 76 6 μg l 1 after oxidation with 2 mg l 1 kmno4 for 300 min a relatively lower initial mc concentration 59 1 μg l 1 was observed in ery 5 and it decreased to 40 6 μg l 1 reduction of 29 during treatment with kmno4 for 300 min the majority of mcs were intracellular for all of the cyanobacterial samples at the initial time of oxidation with kmno4 fig 3 the concentrations of intracellular mcs remained constant in the first 35 min and were degraded steadily to 300 min in all three ery exposed experiments the initial concentrations of extracellular mcs in e control and ery 0 2 was 5 6 and 5 1 μg l 1 respectively while ery 5 contained a higher concentration 11 8 μg l 1 of extracellular mcs the amounts of extracellular mcs were degraded quickly in the first 5 min of kmno4 oxidation for all of the samples and were barely detectable after 300 min in e control and ery 0 2 however for ery 5 the concentration of extracellular mcs remained steady approximately 4 0 μg l 1 during the subsequent oxidation a similar tendency was observed for the change in total mcs caused by 6 mg l 1 kmno4 fig 3b while larger amounts of total mcs were oxidized by kmno4 for all of the samples the concentration of total mcs in e control was decreased from 78 5 to 40 4 μg l 1 reduction of 49 after 300 min of oxidation with kmno4 the concentration of total mcs in ery 0 2 was 81 6 μg l 1 at the initial time and then dropped to 52 5 μg l 1 after 300 min which was still higher than that in e control for ery 5 the concentration of total mcs was reduced from 42 8 to 23 8 μg l 1 reduction of 29 by oxidation with kmno4 for 300 min the initial concentrations of intracellular mcs in e control and ery 0 2 were 72 9 and 74 4 μg l 1 respectively and degraded gradually to 39 2 and 50 7 μg l 1 from 0 to 300 min respectively while in ery 5 it remained constant approximately 33 0 μg l 1 during 35 min and was degraded to 23 0 μg l 1 during subsequent time till 300 min the initial concentration of extracellular mcs in e control ery 0 2 and ery 5 was 5 6 7 2 and 8 8 μg l 1 respectively the degradation trend of these extracellular mcs was similar to that in the first 5 min of treatment with 2 mg l 1 kmno4 however these mcs were barely detectable from 5 to 65 min in e control and ery 0 2 while they increased to 1 19 and 1 86 μg l 1 at 300 min respectively for ery 5 the extracellular mcs oxidized by 6 mg l 1 kmno4 was approximately 1 μg l 1 from 0 to 65 min and 1 μg l 1 at 300 min gene expression of m aeruginosa cultures dosed with 0 5 0 μg l 1 ery for 4 days was tested in order to explore mc production mcyb and transportation mcyh in m aeruginosa cells affected by ery fig 4 gene expression was not obviously modified by 0 2 μg l 1 ery p 0 05 however the expression of mcyb and mcyh were significantly upregulated by 1 0 μg l 1 ery while slightly downregulated by 5 0 μg l 1 ery p 0 05 3 3 intracellular ros levels intracellular ros levels of m aeruginosa cells dosed with ery 0 5 0 μg l 1 were evaluated at the initial 0 min and after a short time 5 min of oxidation with kmno4 fig 5 the intracellular ros levels in m aeruginosa samples collected on days 1 4 and 6 are expressed as the fold induction compared to that in e control on the same day at the initial oxidation time e control was equal to 1 ros level 1 represents stimulation ros level 1 represents inhabitation for the initial oxidation time there was no significantly differences between e control ery 0 2 and ery 5 on days 1 4 and 6 the intracellular ros production in m aeruginosa cells on day 1 was significantly stimulated by 1 0 μg l 1 ery p 0 05 with an intracellular ros level of 1 8 however there was no obvious difference in ros values between ery 1 and e control on days 4 and 6 p 0 05 for the short treatment time 5 min with 2 mg l 1 kmno4 the intracellular ros levels were higher than those at the initial time for all samples on the three days fig 5 the intracellular ros levels in e control were approximately 3 1 on the three days the ros levels in ery 0 2 and ery 1 on days 1 and 6 after 5 min of oxidation with kmno4 were higher than that in e control the highest levels of intracellular ros were detected in ery 5 with values of 11 9 day 1 4 9 day 4 and 4 7 day 6 for a higher dose 6 mg l 1 of kmno4 after 5 min of treatment the intracellular ros levels in e control were 8 7 9 1 and 10 5 on days 1 4 and 6 respectively which were considerably higher than samples treated with 2 mg l 1 kmno4 fig 5 the intracellular ros level of ery 0 2 was 19 1 which was significantly higher than that of the other samples on day 1 p 0 05 the intracellular ros levels in ery 1 and ery 5 collected on day 1 were approximately 9 3 which was similar to that of the e control however the intracellular ros levels in ery treated samples on day 4 were lower than e control with values of 6 2 ery 0 2 6 0 ery 1 and 4 9 ery 5 4 discussion 4 1 the effects of ery on the characteristics of m aeruginosa cells cyanobacteria which are similar to bacteria stanier and cohen bazire 1977 have been reported as cells that are sensitive to various antibiotics van der grinten et al 2010 rico et al 2018 in this study the cell growth of m aeruginosa was stimulated by ery at a low concentration 0 2 μg l 1 while it was inhibited at a high concentration 5 0 μg l 1 these findings are in agreement with a previous study which observed that the growth of microcystis flos aquae was stimulated by 0 001 0 1 μg l 1 ery but was inhibited by ery concentrations higher than 10 μg l 1 wan et al 2015 this phenomenon could be explained as hormesis which means that organisms can have a stimulatory response when they are exposed to low doses of substances but have a deleterious response caused by high doses of the same substances crump 2001 the concentration of total mcs in e control was lower than that in ery 0 2 but was higher than in ery 5 fig 3 considering the similar tendency observed in the results of cell growth fig 1 the cell density of cyanobacteria could be likely to positively correlate with the production of total mcs wang et al 2007 in the gene test 5 0 μg l 1 ery was observed to inhibit mc production where the gene expression of mcyb related to mc production was downregulated fig 4 this might be another reason that the concentration of total mcs in ery 5 was considerably lower than that in e control there was a highest concentration of extracellular mcs in ery 5 however the mc transport gene mcyh was downregulated and the membrane integrity was unaffected hence the increase in extracellular mcs might be attributed to the release of mcs as a response by cyanobacteria against environmental stresses tsai 2015 in the treatment with 0 2 μg l 1 ery the gene expression related to mc production mcyb and mc transportation mcyh were not obviously modified fig 4 this indicates that the stimulation of cell growth may be the major factor for the increase of total mcs in the m aeruginosa samples treated with a low concentration of ery in this study an ery concentration of 0 2 μg l 1 was similar to that documented by liu et al 2015 in which 0 2 and 0 5 μg l 1 amoxicillin stimulated both cell proliferation and production of total mcs in m aeruginosa thus antibiotics with environmentally relevant concentrations may promote the cell growth of cyanobacteria and increase environmental risk by enhancing the production of total mcs to some extent higher concentrations e g 5 0 μg l 1 of ery may have negative effects on their cell growth and production of total mcs this finding agreed with a previous study which illustrated that high concentrations of np could inhibit both cell proliferation and production of mcs wang et al 2007 however a higher concentration of extracellular mcs was detected in ery 5 compared with that in e control fig 3a which indicated that the possible risks caused by higher concentrations of antibiotics in source waters should be also taken into account 4 2 the effectiveness of kmno4 on m aeruginosa samples dosed with ery previous studies have demonstrated that oxidation with kmno4 can efficiently remove antibiotics or cyanobacteria hu et al 2010 fan et al 2013 for treatment with 2 mg l 1 kmno4 both the cell density and integrity of m aeruginosa samples with without ery remained constant after 300 min figs 1b and 2 this agrees with a previous study which revealed that 98 of the m aeruginosa cells were intact and the cell densities remained fairly constant at low concentration kmno4 below 3 mg l 1 treatments for 6 h fan et al 2013 although the cyanobacterial cells were generally intact after treatment with 2 mg l 1 kmno4 for 300 min the intracellular mcs in all of the samples were obviously degraded the decrease of intracellular mcs in the intact cells was also observed in e control and ery 0 2 during treatment with 6 mg l 1 kmno4 for 65 min one possible reason is that kmno4 could enter through the cyanobacterial membrane and degrade the intracellular mcs which was also mentioned by fan et al 2013 the increased levels of intracellular ros observed on day 4 approximately 3 1 4 9 and 4 9 9 0 during treatments with 2 and 6 mg l 1 kmno4 respectively also implied kmno4 might enter into cyanobacterial cells and further degrade the intracellular toxins fig 5 this agrees with wang et al 2015 who found that the diffusion of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 into m aeruginosa cells could lead to an increase in the intracellular ros levels alternatively the increasing level of ros might be a cellular response of m aeruginosa cells against oxidation with kmno4 which further degrades the intracellular mcs tang et al 2018 although the extracellular mcs were hardly detectable in 0 and 0 2 μg l 1 ery treated cyanobacterial samples after oxidation with 2 mg l 1 kmno4 for 300 min they could still be detected 4 6 μg l 1 in ery 5 it may be that the residual kmno4 in the m aeruginosa samples dosed with 5 0 μg l 1 ery was inadequate to oxidize the extracellular mcs fig s1 the water quality value for mc lr in drinking water guidelines recommended by the world health organization who 2011 is 1 μg l 1 this study suggests that there might be a risk of treatment with low dose kmno4 below 2 mg l 1 when high concentrations of ery coexist with m aeruginosa cells in raw waters therefore larger amounts of oxidants might be required under this situation previous study has also shown that higher chlorine doses were demanded to oxidize the cyanotoxins in raw water lake greifensee with complex chemical composition rodriguez et al 2007 thus micropollutants such as antibiotics could significantly affect the efficiency of water treatment processes the cell integrity of m aeruginosa samples dosed with 0 1 0 μg l 1 ery for 1 day could be significantly destroyed during treatment with 6 mg l 1 kmno4 from 65 to 300 min fig 2b while the cell densities kept relatively constant fig 1c wert et al 2013 have also reported that m aeruginosa cells were devitalized after oxidation by chlorine and chlorine dioxide but the cell numbers remained stable as the cell membranes were not completely fragmented therefore oxidants could damage cyanobacterial cells in a short time but their ability might be not strong enough to breakdown the cells completely this study revealed that the cellular damage effect of kmno4 decreased with the growing culture time of cyanobacterial samples from day 1 6 table s1 it was a common consequence of higher oxidant demand consumed by a higher cell density of cyanobacteria lin et al 2009 fan et al 2018 the extracellular mcs in the m aeruginosa samples dosed with 0 5 0 μg l 1 ery were hardly detectable when oxidized by 6 mg l 1 kmno4 for 65 min however concentrations of extracellular mcs above 1 μg l 1 were observed in e control and ery 0 2 at 300 min after oxidation with kmno4 possibly attributing to further cell lysis fig 2 and may pose a health risk to humans for ery 5 the extracellular mcs were degraded steadily from initial time to 300 min with the membrane integrity of m aeruginosa cells nearly unaffected the impact of kmno4 on cyanobacterial cell rupture decreased with increasing ery concentration fig 2 which may be due to the scavenging effect of ery on kmno4 fig s1 the effects of ery on oxidation of total mcs was positively correlated with its effects on cellular damage by 6 mg l 1 kmno4 where the order of total mc reduction was ery 5 19 0 μg l 1 ery 0 2 29 1 μg l 1 e control 38 1 μg l 1 fig 3b these results indicated that the micropollutant antibiotics in source waters may significantly reduce the efficiency of kmno4 in cyanobacterial cell inactivation and the associated toxin degradation 5 conclusions the cell growth of cyanobacteria and associated production of total mcs could be promoted by a micropollutant such as ery at an environmentally relevant concentration 0 2 μg l 1 the extracellular mcs in the m aeruginosa cells pre exposed to 0 2 μg l 1 ery were hardly detectable within intact cells during treatment with 2 mg l 1 kmno4 however 6 mg l 1 kmno4 caused cellular damage in m aeruginosa samples dosed with 0 2 μg l 1 ery which led to a concentration of extracellular mcs higher than the safe guideline 1 μg l 1 proposed by the who high concentration of ery 5 0 μg l 1 had a negative impact on the growth and mc production of m aeruginosa cells the decrease in mc production may be attributed to the downregulation of expression of the mc synthesis gene mcyb although the mc transport gene mcyh was also downregulated by 5 0 μg l 1 ery the highest concentration of extracellular mcs was observed with this treatment kmno4 at a concentration of 2 mg l 1 was inadequate in completely oxidizing the extracellular mcs in general the efficiency of oxidation with kmno4 was reduced with increasing ery concentration it was not only due to the consumption of kmno4 by ery but also attributed to the effects of ery on the alteration of the proliferation and toxin production of m aeruginosa cells declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17956,polymeric photocatalysts are promising candidates for water purification however their catalytic performance are still unsatisfactory due to the fast charge recombination that leads to low reactive oxygen radicals production in this study a conceptual energy transfer mediated photocatalytic oxygen activation system over polymeric carbon nitride without the need of electron hole separation is proposed exhibiting remarkable singlet oxygen triggered bacteria inactivation performance as well as organic pollutants degradation by structure and excitonic effect modulation the oxygen activation process changes from the traditional electron transfer mechanism to the final energy transfer pathway leading to the selective generation of singlet oxygen with high efficiency the generated singlet oxygen is found to fervently attack the bacteria membrane creating irreparable pores or holes on the cell membrane for cytoplasmic contents leaking out to accelerate bacteria destruction the work demonstrated here offers a new photocatalytic oxygen activation pathway for achieving high efficient reactive oxygen species generation performance without the need of charge separation graphical abstract image 1 keywords carbon nitride nanosheet photocatalytic water disinfection oxygen activation singlet oxygen energy transfer process organic pollutants degradation 1 introduction drinking water disinfection for pathogenic microorganism removal is of significant importance for public health safety in view of the infective waterborne bacteria or viruses that could cause various diseases cutler and miller 2005 lee et al 2002 mylne et al 2014 santosham et al 2010 shannon et al 2010 as a safe and sustainable way for pathogenic organism inactivation photocatalytic water disinfection through a radical oxidative manner in recent year has been intensively studied chu et al 2019 wang et al 2015 2017c xia et al 2015 the key step to achieve high photocatalytic water disinfection performance lies in the generation of large amount of reactive oxygen species ros since the ros are serving as the main reactive species for killing bacteria kohn and nelson 2007 liu et al 2018 xia et al 2015 various materials with high ros generation activity have been developed as photocatalysts for bacteria inactivation wang et al 2017c while most of them are merely transition metal based with high risk of toxicity due to the leakage of heavy metal species cho et al 2004 li et al 2019 xia et al 2013 zhang et al 2010 this is unacceptable as the removal of pathogenic microorganisms is at the cost of introducing other kinds of pollutants that maybe even more harmful than the bacteria itself thus the exploration of environmentally friendly polymeric materials with high bacteria inactivation performance is highly desirable graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 in recent years has been shown as a hot material for organic pollutants degradation and water disinfection due to the following advantages 1 g c3n4 is composed of only earth abundant elements of c and n that can be easily fabricated via the direct polymerization of c n abundant precursors urea cyandiamide dicyandiamide melamine et al the low cost and easy fabrication process make it more suitable for low cost water treatment 2 g c3n4 is highly physicochemical stable against high temperature 600 c and low or high ph conditions 3 the polymeric nature makes it easy for structural manipulation 4 g c3n4 is capable of using visible light 2 7 ev and the energy structure is found suitable for ros generation ong et al 2016 zeng et al 2019a b zheng et al 2016 in photocatalysis the mainstream viewpoint for ros generation usually follows the electron transfer mediated molecular oxygen activation mechanism whereas high electron hole separation efficiency is a prerequisite he et al 2013 hu et al 2017 zhao et al 2014 nevertheless the photogenerated charge carriers in polymeric materials are in the form of bound electron hole couples frenkel excitons with large coulomb interactions due to the low dielectric constant and large wave functions overlap of electron and hole leading to the fast charge recombination blancon et al 2017 brazovskii and kirova 2010 sun et al 2014 traditional methods for boosting electron hole separation by charge carrier manipulations are somehow incomprehensive because most of them ignored the excitonic effect that should actually be taken into consideration li et al 2015 serpone and emeline 2012 to achieve electron hole spatial separation the excitons should be firstly dissociated into free electrons and holes however current strategies can hardly provide abundant energy disordered interfaces to offer such an additional energy with driving force larger than the binding energy of exciton for exciton dissociation lan et al 2019 li et al 2016 shi et al 2017 tamura and burghardt 2013 wang et al 2017b as such an obstacle can hardly be conquered what about directly using the exciton to activate oxygen for ros generation the direct use of exciton for oxygen activation proposed here would bypass the need of electron hole separation for achieving ros generation it s well known that the common ros of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 hydroxyl radicals oh superoxide radicals o2 are generated via electron transfer process which needs high electron hole separation efficiency while another kind of radical singlet oxygen 1o2 that is found highly fervent for bacteria membrane destruction is usually formed by the direct use of exciton via the energy transfer mechanism lee et al 2009 lim et al 2016 generally the energy transfer process for 1o2 generation involves the energy transfer from triplet exciton to ground state oxygen chen et al 2017 fateminia et al 2018 wang et al 2017a however the photogenerated excitons in g c3n4 are mostly in the singlet form due to the large energy gap δeb for the conversion of singlet exciton into triplet form through the internal system crossing isc which cannot be used to converse the spin flip of oxygen wu et al 2018 thus it is necessary to find a way out to facilitate the conversion of singlet exciton to triplet state so as to achieving high water disinfection performance to our knowledge the use of carbon nitride for water disinfection through energy transfer mediated oxygen activation path has not reported so far herein we report the use of carbonyl functionalized carbon nitride nanosheets ccn ns as a 1o2 generation polymeric material for effective bacteria inactivation the installed carbonyl groups may affect the spin orbital coupling of carbon nitride nanosheets promoting the isc process by reducing the isc energy gap realizing the goal of direct using exciton to activate oxygen for singlet oxygen generation to this end our specific objectives of this study are 1 trying to find out a new way without the need of electron hole separation for photocatalytic ros generation 2 how and why carbonyl groups modification makes carbon nitride capable of direct using electron hole couples excitons to activate oxygen for singlet oxygen generation 3 mechanism interpretation of how singlet oxygen inactivate e coli 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and regents urea isopropanol h2so4 kmno4 edta 2na and h2o2 were purchased from china sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd tertiary butyl alcohol t buoh superoxide dismutase sod l histidine catalase 3 3 5 5 tetramethylbenzidine tmb 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidone temp ch3cooh ch3coona kbr and baso4 were obtained from aladdin while the escherichia coli nacl and lb nutrition were received from sangon biotech shanghai co ltd all the chemicals and reagents were used as obtained without additional purification 2 2 materials synthesis carbon nitride nanosheets cn ns were fabricated by the direct ultrasonication of g c3n4 in isopropanol water solution 40 vol 60 vol for 10 h the carbonyl functionalized carbon nitride nanosheets ccn ns were synthesized via a modified strong acid activation process oh et al 2015 in a typical procedure 200 mg of exfoliated carbon nitride nanosheets was added into a flask followed by adding 50 ml of h2so4 and 0 1g of kmno4 under an ice bar condition after the reaction freezing water was added into the flask followed by adding excess amount of h2o2 into the system until no bubbles appeared after washing and separation the obtained powder was dried at room temperature to show the importance of carbonyl groups to the oxygen activation path control material was prepared by the direct calcination of ccn to remove the carbonyl groups and the obtained sample was donated as ccn ns thermal treated 2 3 materials characterization detailed materials characterization techniques can be found in the supporting information 2 4 photocatalytic e coli inactivation photocatalytic e coli inactivation experiments were carried out in a quartz container during which flow cooling water was employed to maintain the reactor temperature of 20 c a 300 w xeon lamp perfect light co ltd china with light intensity of 80 mw cm2 was served as light source and an uv40 cut filter was employed to control the output of λ 400 nm light before the experiment all the containers including glass beakers quartz reactor and sampling tubes were subjected to the treatment in an autoclave at 120 c to ensure sterility the e coli solution for photocatalytic experiments was firstly incubated in a liquid lb nutrition at 37 c for 22 5 h with continues shaking followed by centrifugation to separate the bacteria subsequently the obtained bacteria precipitates were redispersed in 0 9 wt saline to form a bacteria concentration of about 1 107 colony forming units per milliliter cfu ml 1 in a typical photocatalytic disinfection cycle 50 mg of photocatalyst was dispersed in 60 ml of e coli solution with stirring after keeping in dark condition for half an hour to ensure the adsorption desorption equilibrium the system was subjected to light irradiation after a fixed photocatalytic reaction interval 1 ml of solution was sampled out and diluted directly with saline and spread on nutrient agars without separating the catalyst from the solution the agars were incubated at 37 c for 20 h before counting the colonies number of viable bacteria to evaluate the stability of the catalyst five cycling tests toward bacteria inactivation were allow to proceeded for the cycling experiments the catalyst suspension after each running was centrifuged to collect the catalyst and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 c the obtained catalyst was directly used for next cycle without any further treatment it should be pointed out that before each cycle all the reactors were subjected to the treatment in an autoclave at 120 c for half an hour to ensure sterility for starting a new cycle the catalyst was dispersed into the bacteria saline solution in this work photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants was also employed to evaluate the catalytic activity of as prepared materials however the detailed description of photocatalytic organic pollutants degradation process and the related analyzing methods of specific pollutant concentration changes were provided in the supporting information to investigate the main reactive radicals that contribute to the final bacteria inactivation radical capture experiments were conducted here according to previously reported method chen et al 2017 hu et al 2017 lim et al 2016 xia et al 2015 zhao et al 2014 tertiary butyl alcohol t buoh superoxide dismutase sod l histidine catalase and edta 2na were introduced to respectively probe the generated reactive species of oh o2 1o2 h2o2 and photogenerated hole h to make the experimental results more trustable all the experiments were repeated for three times 2 5 analytical method the bacterial inactivation performance is believed to strongly correlate to the generation of ros through molecular activation here we choose the 3 3 5 5 tetramethylbenzidine tmb oxidation reaction to evaluate the photocatalytic oxygen activation performance and to quantify the generated amount of specific ros chen et al 2017 sun et al 2019 in detail 10 mg of photocatalyst was dispersed into 20 ml of deionized water then 20 μl of the above suspension and 20 μl of tmb solution 17 5 mm were injected to 2 ml of acetate buffer solution hac naac ph 4 in a quartz cell subsequently the quartz cell was subjected to visible light irradiation after beening illuminated for a desired time intervals the quartz cell was subjected to an uv vis spectrophotometer at 651 nm to measure the tmb oxidation performance the produced o2 and 1o2 were further confirmed and identified by electron paramagnetic resonance epr analysis where 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidone temp were respectively used as spin trapping reagents and light irradiation was also employed during the tests 3 results and discussion 3 1 materials characterizations the ccn ns is fabricated via a modified strong acid activation process which is similar to the oxide graphene fabrication process during which the concentrated acid h2so4 with high oxidation ability could oxide the ccn ns leading to the introduction of abundant carbonyl groups the scanning emission microscopy sem and transmission electron microscopy tem images in fig 1 and fig s1 show that cn ns exhibits a few layered nanosheet like morphology with a smooth surface while some pores are formed on the nanosheets of ccn ns after the acid activation treatment which may due to the strong depolymerization ability of kmno4 that leads to oxygen species introduction zhang et al 2015 the surface area and porosity information of ccn ns and cn ns were further uncovered by the nitrogen sorption desorption isotherms and the results were shown in fig s2 in supporting information zhang et al 2015 the formation of pores on the nanosheets doesn t alter the typical cn structure a lot since both materials display similar xrd patterns with two typical diffraction peaks fig 1c ultraviolet visible spectra drs fig 1d reveal that both materials are capable of visible light response with comparable band gaps regardless of the formation of pores on the surface the composed elements are identified by xps survey in fig 2 a in which ccn ns shows high oxygen content of 6 7 in atomic inserted table in fig 2a this is further confirmed by sem eds mappings shown in fig 2b and fig s3 where the oxygen element is homogeneously distributed in the entire ccn ns to uncover the type of introduced oxygen species additional characterizations and detailed analysis are further performed as displayed in fig 2c different with cn ns that shows only one peak at 287 9 ev attributing to the sp2 carbon the broad peak of c 1s in ccn ns can be deconvoluted into three peaks with binding energy of 287 5 287 9 and 288 5 ev respectively assigning to n co n cn and o co for n 1s spectrum fig 2d four typical peaks are found on both materials with binding energy located at 398 4 399 7 400 8 and 404 0 ev respectively attribute to the sp2 hybridized aromatic n cn c the tenary n of n c 3 unfully polymerized amino groups nhx and charging effect and localized charge within the heterocycles it should be noticed that these two materials show comparable c 1s and n 1s spectra indicating that after the acid activation the typical carbon nitride skeleton remains unchanged it should be noticed that these two materials show comparable c 1s and n 1s spectra indicating that after the acid activation the typical carbon nitride skeleton remains unchanged the significant difference of these two materials is found from the o 1s xps spectra in fig 2e where ccn ns gives a more conspicuous peak than that of cn ns confirming the high introducing amount of o element detailed interpretations show that besides the adsorbed oxygen species at 532 4 ev for water and 533 3 ev for oads a prominent peak assigning to carbonyl group is found located at 531 4 ev suggesting the rich content of carbonyl groups in ccn ns gao et al 2018 direct evidence for the successful introduction of carbonyl groups is further supported by the ft ir spectra fig 2f where the ccn ns displays a new peak originating from the co stretching at 1720 cm 1 oh et al 2015 these results demonstrate the successful introduction of carbonyl groups in ccn ns the functionalization of carbonyl groups may therefore alter the electronic and energy band structure that determines the molecular oxygen activation process affecting the subsequent catalytic reactions as shown in fig s4a the flat band positions of cn ns and ccn ns from the positive mott schottky plots are respectively tested to be 1 15 and 1 20ev indicating both samples are n type semiconductors and thermal dynamically suitable to activate oxygen for reactive oxygen species production the xps valence band of both materials show that the maximum valence band position are the same and determined to be 1 99 ev fig s4b by ploting the drs result using the tauc plot formular the band gaps of cn ns and ccn ns are calculated to be 2 97 and 3 05 ev respectively based on these results the accurate energy band configuration is obtained and shown in fig s4d in which both materials are thermal dynamically suitable for molecular activation to generate ros 3 2 photocatalytic disinfection of e coli the catalytic performance of as prepared materials are evaluated by photocatalytic water disinfection where water samples with e coli concentration of 107 cfu ml 1 are used to simulate the polluted water negligible cells concentration changes can be found neither for the system with only light irradiation nor the one without light irradiation but with catalyst adding ruling out the possible influence of visible light irradiation or catalyst itself to bacteria living as shown in fig 3 a with the addition of ccn ns into the system all of the bacteria are inactivated after 4h light irradiation which is much higher than the cn ns counterpart with only about 50 of bacteria inactivation activity and is even comparable to other carbon nitride based materials table s1 similar catalytic activity trend can be also found on these two materials toward organic pollutants figs s5 6 besides the high catalytic performance the structure stability is another important factor for photocatlytic water disinfection as shown in fig 3b no obvious catalytic activity loss is found after five consecutive water disinfection experiments demonstrating the robust structural stability of ccn ns 3 3 reactive oxygen radicals capture experiments in photocatalytic water disinfection the bacteria inactivation performance is believed to strongly relate to the generated radicals thus the contribution of each kind of radicals to the final bacteria killing is then investigated here t buoh sod l histidine catalase and edta 2na are introduced to respectively probe the generated reactive species of oh o2 1o2 h2o2 and photo generated hole h lim et al 2016 for the cn ns system fig 3c the presence of sod significantly quenches the bacteria inactivation activity while other three scavengers of t buoh l histidine or catalase doesn t change the catalytic performance revealing the main contribution of o2 to the bacteria inactivation we also found that the catalytic activity cannot be fully quenched even if adding excess amount of sod into the reactions system such phenomenon can be explained by the fact that photo generated h can also contribute to bacteria inactivation as evidenced by the catalytic activity loss when adding edta 2na into the system as for ccn ns fig 3d the main radical contributing to bacteria killing is 1o2 as most of the catalytic performance quenched with the addition of l histidine into the system while h also contribute to the bacteria killing but much less than the one from 1o2 based on the above results one can easily conclude that the main radicals for bacteria inactivation on cn ns and ccn ns are o2 and 1o2 respectively 3 4 identification and quantification of generated radicals as both o2 and 1o2 are two strong oxidative radicals for bacteria killing with comparable light adsorption fig s4 it is necessary to uncover the mechanism of why ccn ns shows superior catalytic performance than cn ns counterpart for photocatalytic water disinfection the amount of generated ros is thought to be the key factor determining the bacteria killing performance thus the quantification of the generated amount of ros is vital here tmb oxidation is selected as the probe reaction to quantify the generated amount of reactive radicals since almost all kinds of radicals including h are capable of oxidating tmb to give a blue color chen et al 2017 sun et al 2019 as shown in fig 4 a ccn ns gives a much higher time dependent peak absorbance at 370 or 651 nm than that of cn ns counterpart demonstrating the much faster ros production rates in ccn ns furthermore both materials show distinguishable tmb oxidation characters in different gas atmospheres o2 ar and air revealing the generated ros are evolved from molecular oxygen activation fig 4b the higher peak absorbance shown here is also indicative of the higher ros generation amount in ccn ns than that of cn ns which well explained why ccn ns displays higher bacteria inactivation performance than cn ns to clarify the type of ros involving in the tmb oxidation t buoh sod l histidine and catalase are respectively introduced as scavengers to quench oh o2 1o2 and h2o2 as shown in fig 4c the addition of l histidine into the ccn ns system significantly inhibits the tmb oxidation whereas other three scavengers seem to not affect the tmb oxidation rate these results reveal that 1o2 is the main photogenerated ros accounting for the tmb oxidation in contrast the main photogenerated ros in cn ns is o2 since the addition of sod into the reaction system dramatically inhibits the tmb oxidation in addition the peak absorbance at 651 nm of ccn ns is much higher than cn ns indicating that the amount of generated 1o2 is much more than the o2 as a powerful means to give the most direct evidence to indentify the reactive species of 1o2 and o2 ccn ns and cn ns are subjected to epr tests as shown in fig 4d a triplet signal with intensity of 1 1 1 is observed in the presence of ccn ns attributing to the generated 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine n oxyl tempo sun et al 2019 wang et al 2017b furthermore the addition of l histidine substantially reduces the signal intensity demonstrating the generation of 1o2 in ccn ns system as a reference negligible 1o2 is generated in the cn ns system as the triplet signal intensity is quite low to check the generated o2 dmpo in methanol solution is used as the trapping reagent no obvious epr signal is found on ccn ns ruling out the generation of o2 while a quaternate signal with intensity of 1 1 1 1 referring to the spin derivative of dmpo o2 is shown on cn ns confirming the production of o2 the much higher epr signal intensity shown here further supports the claim of the more generated radicals on ccn ns than the cn ns counterpart leading to the much higher bacteria inactivation activity 3 5 factors affecting the radical generation pathway as we may still wonder what makes cn ns and cn ns show different radical generation paths as both materials are few layered carbon nitride with comparable light absorption ability and energy band structures fig s4 by interpreting the ros generation mechanism we may better understand the involved key factors so as to guide further catalytic activity improvement after carful structural analysis we deduce that it is the introduced carbonyl group that makes cn ns and ccn ns undergo different radical production paths since the giant structure difference of these two materials is the introduced carbonyl group to support this claim additional experiments are performed to eliminate the carbonyl groups as shown in fig 5 a after subjecting the sample to thermal treatment the carbonyl stretching derived peak at 1720 cm 1 disappeared with other peaks are retained demonstrating the successful elimination of carbonyl groups while keeping the basic cn structure unchanged the removal of carbonyl groups dramatically decreases the catalytic activity toward tmb oxidation fig 5b suggesting the large decrement in ros production this can be further confirmed by the epr tests where the thermal treated sample shows significantly inhibited triplet signal intensity indicating the reduced 1o2 generation amount fig 5c as a result of the reduced 1o2 generation the thermal treated material shows a much lower bacteria inactivation activity than ccn ns fig 5d interestingly we found the bacteria killing performance of the thermal treated material is comparable to that of cn ns suggesting that the elimination of introduced carbonyl groups changed the ros generation path from 1o2 back to o2 the need of high electron hole separation for oxygen activation severely limits the o2 generation performance which should be the main reason for the low bacteria inactivation activity on cn ns or thermal treated ccn ns 3 6 mechanism insight into photocatalytic singlet oxygen generation we further investigate the mechanism of how the modified carbonyl groups affect the molecular oxygen activation pathway as known to us the generation of 1o2 often follows the energy transfer oxygen activation path where high triplet exciton yield is a fundamental prerequisite wu et al 2018 because only the triplet excitons are energetic enough to drive the spin flip of oxygen for singlet oxygen generation however the photo generated charge carriers in polymeric materials are mostly in the singlet exciton form due to the large energy gap between singlet and triplet excitons according to the first order perturbation theory beljonne et al 2001 masmanidis et al 1975 turning the spin orbital coupling may offer us the opportunity to modulate the energy gap between singlet and triplet excitons here the introduction of carbonyl group may also affect the spin orbital coupling of the material reducing the energy barrier for the conversion of singlet exciton into triplet state for subsequent oxygen activation as displayed in fig 6 a ccn ns exhibits an obviously quenched pl intensity than that of cn ns counterpart revealing the reduced singlet exciton populations zeng et al 2019a b zhang et al 2017 the quenched pl signal intensity shown here doesn t mean the enhanced charge separation due to the fact that the ccn ns gives a even much lower photocurrent density than that of cn ns fig 6c thus the pl intensity decrement shown here may refer to the conversion of singlet exciton to other kind of energy for example triplet form exciton this assumption is further corroborated by the phosphorescence ph spectra fig 6b where ccn ns gives much higher phosphorescence ph intensity than cn ns indicating the increased triplet exciton yield as the ph originated from the triplet exciton recombination the decrement of singlet exciton population as well as the increased triplet exaction yield shown here are indicative of the successful realization of the conversion of exciton from singlet state into triplet form in sharp contrast the large coulomb interactions between the electron and hole make it hard for singlet exciton dissociation to generate free electron and hole thus most of the singlet excitons in cn ns are wasted by exciton annihilation to release pl the energy separation between ph and pl is a key factor that determining the transformation of singlet exciton to triplet state via the isc process wu et al 2017 thus the energy barrier of δeb is tested as seen in fig 8d the δeb of ccn ns is about 0 162 ev which is more than 35 lower than the cn ns counterpart 0 250 ev the reduced isc barrier may therefore significantly accelerating the conversion of singlet exciton into triplet form leading to the much higher triplet excitons yields time resolved spectra are further performed to investigate the kinetics for exciton transformation and 1o2 production as depicted in fig 6e apparent pl lifetime decrement is observed on ccn ns 12 2 ns than that of cn ns 13 3 ns demonstrating the fast conversion of singlet exiton into triplet form through the isc procedure in contrast the longer pl time as well as the high pl intensity demonstrates the excitons in cn ns are mostly in the singlet form because the large energy separation blocks the transformation of pl to ph leading to the fast singlet exciton annihilations and exhibiting limited photocatalytic activity with enhanced triplet yield we may more care about the o2 activation process for ros production here we employed tr ph spectra to investigate the o2 activation kinetics since the ph lifetime is closely correlated to the conversion of spin flip of oxygen for 1o2 generation to make the results more convincible the tr ph tests are conducted in air atmosphere to simulate the spin flip conversion process of triplet oxygen wu et al 2018 fig 6f shows the tr ph spectra in which a distinct ph lifetime decrement is found from 5 3 μs of cn ns to 4 7 μs of ccn ns the decreased ph lifetime attributes to the fast triplet exciton transfer from material to the adsorbed oxygen for spin flip conversion leading to the much higher 1o2 production kinetics on ccn ns the much lower triplet exciton concentration in cn ns should be the main reason for the sluggish 1o2 production kinetics as a result of high 1o2 production kinetic ccn ns gives a much higher 1o2 generation rate than cn ns leading to the superior bacteria inactivation performance the proposed mechanism involving the o2 activation via the traditional electron transfer and the novel energy transfer path for ros generation is illustrated in fig 7 3 7 mechanism of e coli cell destruction by singlet oxygen the generated 1o2 is believed to highly fervent for bacteria membrane destruction thus the bacteria membrane integrity is then visualized by microscopy here acridine orange and ethidium bromid mixture known as the live dead baclight bacterial viability kit are used as fluorescent probes to respectively mark the live and dead cells xia et al 2015 by mixing with the fluorescent dyes the live and dead e coli cells would be stained to respectively give green and red fluorescence as shown in fig 8 the green fluorescent cells decrement is accompanied by the increasing of red fluorescent cells with prolonged treating time demonstrating the gradual cell membrane rupture the cell membrane rupture shown here is also indicative of the successful inactivation of e coli cells the gradual cell membrane change is further investigated by sem as displayed in fig 8a the initial cell gives a plump bacilliform shape with an intact membrane surface however the cell surface becomes wrinkle and pores are found distributed on the entire cell envelope after 1h light irradiation further treatment would enlarge the pores and leads to the cytoplasmic contents leaking out of the cell as a result showing a wizened shape complete cell destruction is achieved with prolonged treating time where only a small part of cell remnant is left based on the aforementioned results a possible mechanism for cell destruction is illustrated in fig 8f first the produced 1o2 fervently attacks the proteins and phospholipids of the cell membrane creating irreparable pores to increase the membrane permeability further treatment would allow 1o2 diffusing into the cell to interrupt the bacteria energy metabolism making it hard to maintain the cell membrane potential as a result the cytoplasmic contents would leak out through the pores on the cell membrane accelerating the cell destruction the final step is the random degradation of the cell debris by the continuing supplement of 1o2 via photocatalytic o2 activation process we have also investigated the relationship between antibacterial activity and singlet concentration where the singlet oxygen concentration was controlled by varying the catalyst dosage here the singlet oxygen concentration was tested and quantified by using the furfuryl alcohol ffa degradation reaction as shown in fig s8 it is obvious that the bacteria survival rate is inversely proportional to the concentration of singlet oxygen the higher the singlet oxygen concentration the lower the bacteria survival rate we also fitted the curve using the linear fit equation and found that the fitting factor r2 is 0 99 the linear relationship between log nt n0 and the singlet oxygen concentration is statistically significant this result further confirms that singlet oxygen is highly toxic to e coli leading to the rapid bacteria inactivation 4 conclusion we have demonstrated the first instance of photocatalytic 1o2 production on carbonyl functionalized carbon nitride as a result of the energy transfer mediated oxygen activation the modification of carbon nitride with carbonyl groups reduces the energy separation between pl and ph reducing the isc energy barrier to facilitate the exciton conversion from singlet form into triplet state the triplet exciton is found energetic enough to realize the conversion of spin flip of o2 to produce 1o2 via energy transfer path thus bypassing the need of sufficient electron hole separation for o 2 activation to generate ros such a new proposed 1o2 producing mechanism enables ccn ns show remarkable 1o2 triggered e coli inactivation performance under visible light excitation the produced 1o2 is found to fervently attack the proteins and phospholipids of the bacteria membrane leading to the leakage of cytoplasmic contents through the pores on the cell membrane to speed up the bacteria killing the results shown in this study offered a new way for singlet oxygen production via photocatalysis and the generated singlet oxygen was used for bacteria inactivation future study may optimize the introduced carbonyl groups based on our findings so as to achieve the highest singlet oxygen generation amount as the singlet oxygen was found highly fervent for destructing the proteins and phospholipids of the bacteria membrane the presence of natural organic matter may not largely affect the bacteria disinfection performance which is beneficial for real environmental application for real drinking water disinfection however we still need to immobilize the catalyst so as to prevent catalyst lost another possible

17956,polymeric photocatalysts are promising candidates for water purification however their catalytic performance are still unsatisfactory due to the fast charge recombination that leads to low reactive oxygen radicals production in this study a conceptual energy transfer mediated photocatalytic oxygen activation system over polymeric carbon nitride without the need of electron hole separation is proposed exhibiting remarkable singlet oxygen triggered bacteria inactivation performance as well as organic pollutants degradation by structure and excitonic effect modulation the oxygen activation process changes from the traditional electron transfer mechanism to the final energy transfer pathway leading to the selective generation of singlet oxygen with high efficiency the generated singlet oxygen is found to fervently attack the bacteria membrane creating irreparable pores or holes on the cell membrane for cytoplasmic contents leaking out to accelerate bacteria destruction the work demonstrated here offers a new photocatalytic oxygen activation pathway for achieving high efficient reactive oxygen species generation performance without the need of charge separation graphical abstract image 1 keywords carbon nitride nanosheet photocatalytic water disinfection oxygen activation singlet oxygen energy transfer process organic pollutants degradation 1 introduction drinking water disinfection for pathogenic microorganism removal is of significant importance for public health safety in view of the infective waterborne bacteria or viruses that could cause various diseases cutler and miller 2005 lee et al 2002 mylne et al 2014 santosham et al 2010 shannon et al 2010 as a safe and sustainable way for pathogenic organism inactivation photocatalytic water disinfection through a radical oxidative manner in recent year has been intensively studied chu et al 2019 wang et al 2015 2017c xia et al 2015 the key step to achieve high photocatalytic water disinfection performance lies in the generation of large amount of reactive oxygen species ros since the ros are serving as the main reactive species for killing bacteria kohn and nelson 2007 liu et al 2018 xia et al 2015 various materials with high ros generation activity have been developed as photocatalysts for bacteria inactivation wang et al 2017c while most of them are merely transition metal based with high risk of toxicity due to the leakage of heavy metal species cho et al 2004 li et al 2019 xia et al 2013 zhang et al 2010 this is unacceptable as the removal of pathogenic microorganisms is at the cost of introducing other kinds of pollutants that maybe even more harmful than the bacteria itself thus the exploration of environmentally friendly polymeric materials with high bacteria inactivation performance is highly desirable graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 in recent years has been shown as a hot material for organic pollutants degradation and water disinfection due to the following advantages 1 g c3n4 is composed of only earth abundant elements of c and n that can be easily fabricated via the direct polymerization of c n abundant precursors urea cyandiamide dicyandiamide melamine et al the low cost and easy fabrication process make it more suitable for low cost water treatment 2 g c3n4 is highly physicochemical stable against high temperature 600 c and low or high ph conditions 3 the polymeric nature makes it easy for structural manipulation 4 g c3n4 is capable of using visible light 2 7 ev and the energy structure is found suitable for ros generation ong et al 2016 zeng et al 2019a b zheng et al 2016 in photocatalysis the mainstream viewpoint for ros generation usually follows the electron transfer mediated molecular oxygen activation mechanism whereas high electron hole separation efficiency is a prerequisite he et al 2013 hu et al 2017 zhao et al 2014 nevertheless the photogenerated charge carriers in polymeric materials are in the form of bound electron hole couples frenkel excitons with large coulomb interactions due to the low dielectric constant and large wave functions overlap of electron and hole leading to the fast charge recombination blancon et al 2017 brazovskii and kirova 2010 sun et al 2014 traditional methods for boosting electron hole separation by charge carrier manipulations are somehow incomprehensive because most of them ignored the excitonic effect that should actually be taken into consideration li et al 2015 serpone and emeline 2012 to achieve electron hole spatial separation the excitons should be firstly dissociated into free electrons and holes however current strategies can hardly provide abundant energy disordered interfaces to offer such an additional energy with driving force larger than the binding energy of exciton for exciton dissociation lan et al 2019 li et al 2016 shi et al 2017 tamura and burghardt 2013 wang et al 2017b as such an obstacle can hardly be conquered what about directly using the exciton to activate oxygen for ros generation the direct use of exciton for oxygen activation proposed here would bypass the need of electron hole separation for achieving ros generation it s well known that the common ros of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 hydroxyl radicals oh superoxide radicals o2 are generated via electron transfer process which needs high electron hole separation efficiency while another kind of radical singlet oxygen 1o2 that is found highly fervent for bacteria membrane destruction is usually formed by the direct use of exciton via the energy transfer mechanism lee et al 2009 lim et al 2016 generally the energy transfer process for 1o2 generation involves the energy transfer from triplet exciton to ground state oxygen chen et al 2017 fateminia et al 2018 wang et al 2017a however the photogenerated excitons in g c3n4 are mostly in the singlet form due to the large energy gap δeb for the conversion of singlet exciton into triplet form through the internal system crossing isc which cannot be used to converse the spin flip of oxygen wu et al 2018 thus it is necessary to find a way out to facilitate the conversion of singlet exciton to triplet state so as to achieving high water disinfection performance to our knowledge the use of carbon nitride for water disinfection through energy transfer mediated oxygen activation path has not reported so far herein we report the use of carbonyl functionalized carbon nitride nanosheets ccn ns as a 1o2 generation polymeric material for effective bacteria inactivation the installed carbonyl groups may affect the spin orbital coupling of carbon nitride nanosheets promoting the isc process by reducing the isc energy gap realizing the goal of direct using exciton to activate oxygen for singlet oxygen generation to this end our specific objectives of this study are 1 trying to find out a new way without the need of electron hole separation for photocatalytic ros generation 2 how and why carbonyl groups modification makes carbon nitride capable of direct using electron hole couples excitons to activate oxygen for singlet oxygen generation 3 mechanism interpretation of how singlet oxygen inactivate e coli 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and regents urea isopropanol h2so4 kmno4 edta 2na and h2o2 were purchased from china sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd tertiary butyl alcohol t buoh superoxide dismutase sod l histidine catalase 3 3 5 5 tetramethylbenzidine tmb 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidone temp ch3cooh ch3coona kbr and baso4 were obtained from aladdin while the escherichia coli nacl and lb nutrition were received from sangon biotech shanghai co ltd all the chemicals and reagents were used as obtained without additional purification 2 2 materials synthesis carbon nitride nanosheets cn ns were fabricated by the direct ultrasonication of g c3n4 in isopropanol water solution 40 vol 60 vol for 10 h the carbonyl functionalized carbon nitride nanosheets ccn ns were synthesized via a modified strong acid activation process oh et al 2015 in a typical procedure 200 mg of exfoliated carbon nitride nanosheets was added into a flask followed by adding 50 ml of h2so4 and 0 1g of kmno4 under an ice bar condition after the reaction freezing water was added into the flask followed by adding excess amount of h2o2 into the system until no bubbles appeared after washing and separation the obtained powder was dried at room temperature to show the importance of carbonyl groups to the oxygen activation path control material was prepared by the direct calcination of ccn to remove the carbonyl groups and the obtained sample was donated as ccn ns thermal treated 2 3 materials characterization detailed materials characterization techniques can be found in the supporting information 2 4 photocatalytic e coli inactivation photocatalytic e coli inactivation experiments were carried out in a quartz container during which flow cooling water was employed to maintain the reactor temperature of 20 c a 300 w xeon lamp perfect light co ltd china with light intensity of 80 mw cm2 was served as light source and an uv40 cut filter was employed to control the output of λ 400 nm light before the experiment all the containers including glass beakers quartz reactor and sampling tubes were subjected to the treatment in an autoclave at 120 c to ensure sterility the e coli solution for photocatalytic experiments was firstly incubated in a liquid lb nutrition at 37 c for 22 5 h with continues shaking followed by centrifugation to separate the bacteria subsequently the obtained bacteria precipitates were redispersed in 0 9 wt saline to form a bacteria concentration of about 1 107 colony forming units per milliliter cfu ml 1 in a typical photocatalytic disinfection cycle 50 mg of photocatalyst was dispersed in 60 ml of e coli solution with stirring after keeping in dark condition for half an hour to ensure the adsorption desorption equilibrium the system was subjected to light irradiation after a fixed photocatalytic reaction interval 1 ml of solution was sampled out and diluted directly with saline and spread on nutrient agars without separating the catalyst from the solution the agars were incubated at 37 c for 20 h before counting the colonies number of viable bacteria to evaluate the stability of the catalyst five cycling tests toward bacteria inactivation were allow to proceeded for the cycling experiments the catalyst suspension after each running was centrifuged to collect the catalyst and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 c the obtained catalyst was directly used for next cycle without any further treatment it should be pointed out that before each cycle all the reactors were subjected to the treatment in an autoclave at 120 c for half an hour to ensure sterility for starting a new cycle the catalyst was dispersed into the bacteria saline solution in this work photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants was also employed to evaluate the catalytic activity of as prepared materials however the detailed description of photocatalytic organic pollutants degradation process and the related analyzing methods of specific pollutant concentration changes were provided in the supporting information to investigate the main reactive radicals that contribute to the final bacteria inactivation radical capture experiments were conducted here according to previously reported method chen et al 2017 hu et al 2017 lim et al 2016 xia et al 2015 zhao et al 2014 tertiary butyl alcohol t buoh superoxide dismutase sod l histidine catalase and edta 2na were introduced to respectively probe the generated reactive species of oh o2 1o2 h2o2 and photogenerated hole h to make the experimental results more trustable all the experiments were repeated for three times 2 5 analytical method the bacterial inactivation performance is believed to strongly correlate to the generation of ros through molecular activation here we choose the 3 3 5 5 tetramethylbenzidine tmb oxidation reaction to evaluate the photocatalytic oxygen activation performance and to quantify the generated amount of specific ros chen et al 2017 sun et al 2019 in detail 10 mg of photocatalyst was dispersed into 20 ml of deionized water then 20 μl of the above suspension and 20 μl of tmb solution 17 5 mm were injected to 2 ml of acetate buffer solution hac naac ph 4 in a quartz cell subsequently the quartz cell was subjected to visible light irradiation after beening illuminated for a desired time intervals the quartz cell was subjected to an uv vis spectrophotometer at 651 nm to measure the tmb oxidation performance the produced o2 and 1o2 were further confirmed and identified by electron paramagnetic resonance epr analysis where 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidone temp were respectively used as spin trapping reagents and light irradiation was also employed during the tests 3 results and discussion 3 1 materials characterizations the ccn ns is fabricated via a modified strong acid activation process which is similar to the oxide graphene fabrication process during which the concentrated acid h2so4 with high oxidation ability could oxide the ccn ns leading to the introduction of abundant carbonyl groups the scanning emission microscopy sem and transmission electron microscopy tem images in fig 1 and fig s1 show that cn ns exhibits a few layered nanosheet like morphology with a smooth surface while some pores are formed on the nanosheets of ccn ns after the acid activation treatment which may due to the strong depolymerization ability of kmno4 that leads to oxygen species introduction zhang et al 2015 the surface area and porosity information of ccn ns and cn ns were further uncovered by the nitrogen sorption desorption isotherms and the results were shown in fig s2 in supporting information zhang et al 2015 the formation of pores on the nanosheets doesn t alter the typical cn structure a lot since both materials display similar xrd patterns with two typical diffraction peaks fig 1c ultraviolet visible spectra drs fig 1d reveal that both materials are capable of visible light response with comparable band gaps regardless of the formation of pores on the surface the composed elements are identified by xps survey in fig 2 a in which ccn ns shows high oxygen content of 6 7 in atomic inserted table in fig 2a this is further confirmed by sem eds mappings shown in fig 2b and fig s3 where the oxygen element is homogeneously distributed in the entire ccn ns to uncover the type of introduced oxygen species additional characterizations and detailed analysis are further performed as displayed in fig 2c different with cn ns that shows only one peak at 287 9 ev attributing to the sp2 carbon the broad peak of c 1s in ccn ns can be deconvoluted into three peaks with binding energy of 287 5 287 9 and 288 5 ev respectively assigning to n co n cn and o co for n 1s spectrum fig 2d four typical peaks are found on both materials with binding energy located at 398 4 399 7 400 8 and 404 0 ev respectively attribute to the sp2 hybridized aromatic n cn c the tenary n of n c 3 unfully polymerized amino groups nhx and charging effect and localized charge within the heterocycles it should be noticed that these two materials show comparable c 1s and n 1s spectra indicating that after the acid activation the typical carbon nitride skeleton remains unchanged it should be noticed that these two materials show comparable c 1s and n 1s spectra indicating that after the acid activation the typical carbon nitride skeleton remains unchanged the significant difference of these two materials is found from the o 1s xps spectra in fig 2e where ccn ns gives a more conspicuous peak than that of cn ns confirming the high introducing amount of o element detailed interpretations show that besides the adsorbed oxygen species at 532 4 ev for water and 533 3 ev for oads a prominent peak assigning to carbonyl group is found located at 531 4 ev suggesting the rich content of carbonyl groups in ccn ns gao et al 2018 direct evidence for the successful introduction of carbonyl groups is further supported by the ft ir spectra fig 2f where the ccn ns displays a new peak originating from the co stretching at 1720 cm 1 oh et al 2015 these results demonstrate the successful introduction of carbonyl groups in ccn ns the functionalization of carbonyl groups may therefore alter the electronic and energy band structure that determines the molecular oxygen activation process affecting the subsequent catalytic reactions as shown in fig s4a the flat band positions of cn ns and ccn ns from the positive mott schottky plots are respectively tested to be 1 15 and 1 20ev indicating both samples are n type semiconductors and thermal dynamically suitable to activate oxygen for reactive oxygen species production the xps valence band of both materials show that the maximum valence band position are the same and determined to be 1 99 ev fig s4b by ploting the drs result using the tauc plot formular the band gaps of cn ns and ccn ns are calculated to be 2 97 and 3 05 ev respectively based on these results the accurate energy band configuration is obtained and shown in fig s4d in which both materials are thermal dynamically suitable for molecular activation to generate ros 3 2 photocatalytic disinfection of e coli the catalytic performance of as prepared materials are evaluated by photocatalytic water disinfection where water samples with e coli concentration of 107 cfu ml 1 are used to simulate the polluted water negligible cells concentration changes can be found neither for the system with only light irradiation nor the one without light irradiation but with catalyst adding ruling out the possible influence of visible light irradiation or catalyst itself to bacteria living as shown in fig 3 a with the addition of ccn ns into the system all of the bacteria are inactivated after 4h light irradiation which is much higher than the cn ns counterpart with only about 50 of bacteria inactivation activity and is even comparable to other carbon nitride based materials table s1 similar catalytic activity trend can be also found on these two materials toward organic pollutants figs s5 6 besides the high catalytic performance the structure stability is another important factor for photocatlytic water disinfection as shown in fig 3b no obvious catalytic activity loss is found after five consecutive water disinfection experiments demonstrating the robust structural stability of ccn ns 3 3 reactive oxygen radicals capture experiments in photocatalytic water disinfection the bacteria inactivation performance is believed to strongly relate to the generated radicals thus the contribution of each kind of radicals to the final bacteria killing is then investigated here t buoh sod l histidine catalase and edta 2na are introduced to respectively probe the generated reactive species of oh o2 1o2 h2o2 and photo generated hole h lim et al 2016 for the cn ns system fig 3c the presence of sod significantly quenches the bacteria inactivation activity while other three scavengers of t buoh l histidine or catalase doesn t change the catalytic performance revealing the main contribution of o2 to the bacteria inactivation we also found that the catalytic activity cannot be fully quenched even if adding excess amount of sod into the reactions system such phenomenon can be explained by the fact that photo generated h can also contribute to bacteria inactivation as evidenced by the catalytic activity loss when adding edta 2na into the system as for ccn ns fig 3d the main radical contributing to bacteria killing is 1o2 as most of the catalytic performance quenched with the addition of l histidine into the system while h also contribute to the bacteria killing but much less than the one from 1o2 based on the above results one can easily conclude that the main radicals for bacteria inactivation on cn ns and ccn ns are o2 and 1o2 respectively 3 4 identification and quantification of generated radicals as both o2 and 1o2 are two strong oxidative radicals for bacteria killing with comparable light adsorption fig s4 it is necessary to uncover the mechanism of why ccn ns shows superior catalytic performance than cn ns counterpart for photocatalytic water disinfection the amount of generated ros is thought to be the key factor determining the bacteria killing performance thus the quantification of the generated amount of ros is vital here tmb oxidation is selected as the probe reaction to quantify the generated amount of reactive radicals since almost all kinds of radicals including h are capable of oxidating tmb to give a blue color chen et al 2017 sun et al 2019 as shown in fig 4 a ccn ns gives a much higher time dependent peak absorbance at 370 or 651 nm than that of cn ns counterpart demonstrating the much faster ros production rates in ccn ns furthermore both materials show distinguishable tmb oxidation characters in different gas atmospheres o2 ar and air revealing the generated ros are evolved from molecular oxygen activation fig 4b the higher peak absorbance shown here is also indicative of the higher ros generation amount in ccn ns than that of cn ns which well explained why ccn ns displays higher bacteria inactivation performance than cn ns to clarify the type of ros involving in the tmb oxidation t buoh sod l histidine and catalase are respectively introduced as scavengers to quench oh o2 1o2 and h2o2 as shown in fig 4c the addition of l histidine into the ccn ns system significantly inhibits the tmb oxidation whereas other three scavengers seem to not affect the tmb oxidation rate these results reveal that 1o2 is the main photogenerated ros accounting for the tmb oxidation in contrast the main photogenerated ros in cn ns is o2 since the addition of sod into the reaction system dramatically inhibits the tmb oxidation in addition the peak absorbance at 651 nm of ccn ns is much higher than cn ns indicating that the amount of generated 1o2 is much more than the o2 as a powerful means to give the most direct evidence to indentify the reactive species of 1o2 and o2 ccn ns and cn ns are subjected to epr tests as shown in fig 4d a triplet signal with intensity of 1 1 1 is observed in the presence of ccn ns attributing to the generated 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine n oxyl tempo sun et al 2019 wang et al 2017b furthermore the addition of l histidine substantially reduces the signal intensity demonstrating the generation of 1o2 in ccn ns system as a reference negligible 1o2 is generated in the cn ns system as the triplet signal intensity is quite low to check the generated o2 dmpo in methanol solution is used as the trapping reagent no obvious epr signal is found on ccn ns ruling out the generation of o2 while a quaternate signal with intensity of 1 1 1 1 referring to the spin derivative of dmpo o2 is shown on cn ns confirming the production of o2 the much higher epr signal intensity shown here further supports the claim of the more generated radicals on ccn ns than the cn ns counterpart leading to the much higher bacteria inactivation activity 3 5 factors affecting the radical generation pathway as we may still wonder what makes cn ns and cn ns show different radical generation paths as both materials are few layered carbon nitride with comparable light absorption ability and energy band structures fig s4 by interpreting the ros generation mechanism we may better understand the involved key factors so as to guide further catalytic activity improvement after carful structural analysis we deduce that it is the introduced carbonyl group that makes cn ns and ccn ns undergo different radical production paths since the giant structure difference of these two materials is the introduced carbonyl group to support this claim additional experiments are performed to eliminate the carbonyl groups as shown in fig 5 a after subjecting the sample to thermal treatment the carbonyl stretching derived peak at 1720 cm 1 disappeared with other peaks are retained demonstrating the successful elimination of carbonyl groups while keeping the basic cn structure unchanged the removal of carbonyl groups dramatically decreases the catalytic activity toward tmb oxidation fig 5b suggesting the large decrement in ros production this can be further confirmed by the epr tests where the thermal treated sample shows significantly inhibited triplet signal intensity indicating the reduced 1o2 generation amount fig 5c as a result of the reduced 1o2 generation the thermal treated material shows a much lower bacteria inactivation activity than ccn ns fig 5d interestingly we found the bacteria killing performance of the thermal treated material is comparable to that of cn ns suggesting that the elimination of introduced carbonyl groups changed the ros generation path from 1o2 back to o2 the need of high electron hole separation for oxygen activation severely limits the o2 generation performance which should be the main reason for the low bacteria inactivation activity on cn ns or thermal treated ccn ns 3 6 mechanism insight into photocatalytic singlet oxygen generation we further investigate the mechanism of how the modified carbonyl groups affect the molecular oxygen activation pathway as known to us the generation of 1o2 often follows the energy transfer oxygen activation path where high triplet exciton yield is a fundamental prerequisite wu et al 2018 because only the triplet excitons are energetic enough to drive the spin flip of oxygen for singlet oxygen generation however the photo generated charge carriers in polymeric materials are mostly in the singlet exciton form due to the large energy gap between singlet and triplet excitons according to the first order perturbation theory beljonne et al 2001 masmanidis et al 1975 turning the spin orbital coupling may offer us the opportunity to modulate the energy gap between singlet and triplet excitons here the introduction of carbonyl group may also affect the spin orbital coupling of the material reducing the energy barrier for the conversion of singlet exciton into triplet state for subsequent oxygen activation as displayed in fig 6 a ccn ns exhibits an obviously quenched pl intensity than that of cn ns counterpart revealing the reduced singlet exciton populations zeng et al 2019a b zhang et al 2017 the quenched pl signal intensity shown here doesn t mean the enhanced charge separation due to the fact that the ccn ns gives a even much lower photocurrent density than that of cn ns fig 6c thus the pl intensity decrement shown here may refer to the conversion of singlet exciton to other kind of energy for example triplet form exciton this assumption is further corroborated by the phosphorescence ph spectra fig 6b where ccn ns gives much higher phosphorescence ph intensity than cn ns indicating the increased triplet exciton yield as the ph originated from the triplet exciton recombination the decrement of singlet exciton population as well as the increased triplet exaction yield shown here are indicative of the successful realization of the conversion of exciton from singlet state into triplet form in sharp contrast the large coulomb interactions between the electron and hole make it hard for singlet exciton dissociation to generate free electron and hole thus most of the singlet excitons in cn ns are wasted by exciton annihilation to release pl the energy separation between ph and pl is a key factor that determining the transformation of singlet exciton to triplet state via the isc process wu et al 2017 thus the energy barrier of δeb is tested as seen in fig 8d the δeb of ccn ns is about 0 162 ev which is more than 35 lower than the cn ns counterpart 0 250 ev the reduced isc barrier may therefore significantly accelerating the conversion of singlet exciton into triplet form leading to the much higher triplet excitons yields time resolved spectra are further performed to investigate the kinetics for exciton transformation and 1o2 production as depicted in fig 6e apparent pl lifetime decrement is observed on ccn ns 12 2 ns than that of cn ns 13 3 ns demonstrating the fast conversion of singlet exiton into triplet form through the isc procedure in contrast the longer pl time as well as the high pl intensity demonstrates the excitons in cn ns are mostly in the singlet form because the large energy separation blocks the transformation of pl to ph leading to the fast singlet exciton annihilations and exhibiting limited photocatalytic activity with enhanced triplet yield we may more care about the o2 activation process for ros production here we employed tr ph spectra to investigate the o2 activation kinetics since the ph lifetime is closely correlated to the conversion of spin flip of oxygen for 1o2 generation to make the results more convincible the tr ph tests are conducted in air atmosphere to simulate the spin flip conversion process of triplet oxygen wu et al 2018 fig 6f shows the tr ph spectra in which a distinct ph lifetime decrement is found from 5 3 μs of cn ns to 4 7 μs of ccn ns the decreased ph lifetime attributes to the fast triplet exciton transfer from material to the adsorbed oxygen for spin flip conversion leading to the much higher 1o2 production kinetics on ccn ns the much lower triplet exciton concentration in cn ns should be the main reason for the sluggish 1o2 production kinetics as a result of high 1o2 production kinetic ccn ns gives a much higher 1o2 generation rate than cn ns leading to the superior bacteria inactivation performance the proposed mechanism involving the o2 activation via the traditional electron transfer and the novel energy transfer path for ros generation is illustrated in fig 7 3 7 mechanism of e coli cell destruction by singlet oxygen the generated 1o2 is believed to highly fervent for bacteria membrane destruction thus the bacteria membrane integrity is then visualized by microscopy here acridine orange and ethidium bromid mixture known as the live dead baclight bacterial viability kit are used as fluorescent probes to respectively mark the live and dead cells xia et al 2015 by mixing with the fluorescent dyes the live and dead e coli cells would be stained to respectively give green and red fluorescence as shown in fig 8 the green fluorescent cells decrement is accompanied by the increasing of red fluorescent cells with prolonged treating time demonstrating the gradual cell membrane rupture the cell membrane rupture shown here is also indicative of the successful inactivation of e coli cells the gradual cell membrane change is further investigated by sem as displayed in fig 8a the initial cell gives a plump bacilliform shape with an intact membrane surface however the cell surface becomes wrinkle and pores are found distributed on the entire cell envelope after 1h light irradiation further treatment would enlarge the pores and leads to the cytoplasmic contents leaking out of the cell as a result showing a wizened shape complete cell destruction is achieved with prolonged treating time where only a small part of cell remnant is left based on the aforementioned results a possible mechanism for cell destruction is illustrated in fig 8f first the produced 1o2 fervently attacks the proteins and phospholipids of the cell membrane creating irreparable pores to increase the membrane permeability further treatment would allow 1o2 diffusing into the cell to interrupt the bacteria energy metabolism making it hard to maintain the cell membrane potential as a result the cytoplasmic contents would leak out through the pores on the cell membrane accelerating the cell destruction the final step is the random degradation of the cell debris by the continuing supplement of 1o2 via photocatalytic o2 activation process we have also investigated the relationship between antibacterial activity and singlet concentration where the singlet oxygen concentration was controlled by varying the catalyst dosage here the singlet oxygen concentration was tested and quantified by using the furfuryl alcohol ffa degradation reaction as shown in fig s8 it is obvious that the bacteria survival rate is inversely proportional to the concentration of singlet oxygen the higher the singlet oxygen concentration the lower the bacteria survival rate we also fitted the curve using the linear fit equation and found that the fitting factor r2 is 0 99 the linear relationship between log nt n0 and the singlet oxygen concentration is statistically significant this result further confirms that singlet oxygen is highly toxic to e coli leading to the rapid bacteria inactivation 4 conclusion we have demonstrated the first instance of photocatalytic 1o2 production on carbonyl functionalized carbon nitride as a result of the energy transfer mediated oxygen activation the modification of carbon nitride with carbonyl groups reduces the energy separation between pl and ph reducing the isc energy barrier to facilitate the exciton conversion from singlet form into triplet state the triplet exciton is found energetic enough to realize the conversion of spin flip of o2 to produce 1o2 via energy transfer path thus bypassing the need of sufficient electron hole separation for o 2 activation to generate ros such a new proposed 1o2 producing mechanism enables ccn ns show remarkable 1o2 triggered e coli inactivation performance under visible light excitation the produced 1o2 is found to fervently attack the proteins and phospholipids of the bacteria membrane leading to the leakage of cytoplasmic contents through the pores on the cell membrane to speed up the bacteria killing the results shown in this study offered a new way for singlet oxygen production via photocatalysis and the generated singlet oxygen was used for bacteria inactivation future study may optimize the introduced carbonyl groups based on our findings so as to achieve the highest singlet oxygen generation amount as the singlet oxygen was found highly fervent for destructing the proteins and phospholipids of the bacteria membrane the presence of natural organic matter may not largely affect the bacteria disinfection performance which is beneficial for real environmental application for real drinking water disinfection however we still need to immobilize the catalyst so as to prevent catalyst lost another possible application is to immobilize the catalyst on the out surface of respirator sun light irradiation on the catalyst would generate singlet oxygen which may inactivate the bacteria and even virus in the

et al 2009 espinosa et al 2008 kauppinen et al 2018 factors which have been shown influence virus transport during sat include rate of infiltration soil characteristics such as clay content and ph degree of soil saturation presence of organic matter and the structural characteristics of viruses gerba et al 1991 gupta et al 2009 lance and gerba 1984 pang 2009 powelson et al 1993 quanrud et al

found in human fecal matter or spiked bacteriophages as virus surrogates elkayam et al 2015 gerba et al 1991 lance and gerba 1984 powelson et al 1993 wilson et al 1995 there are limited studies which examine the use of viruses typically found in wastewater despite the potential for these viruses to provide better insight to virus removal during full scale sat betancourt et al 2014 recently a plant virus pepper mild mottle virus pmmov and a bacteriophage crassphage have been proposed as water quality indicators due to their high level of excretion in human feces and prevalence in untreated and treated wastewater bibby et al 2019 rosario et al 2009 symonds et al 2018 non human viruses that are found abundantly in wastewater systems have the potential for utilization as a natural process indicator of pathogenic virus removal these indicators can potentially be used to demonstrate the capacity of a treatment technology to remove pathogens prior to its attribution of lrv credits gerba et al 2018 in order to provide a better understanding of the behavior of viruses during full scale sat processes we evaluated the presence and reduction of naturally occurring viruses in a managed aquifer recharge system for wastewater reclamation in tucson arizona the sweetwater recharge facility swrf has been the subject of numerous studies regarding the attenuation of microbial and chemical contaminants in wastewater for further urban reuse betancourt et al 2014 gerba et al 1991 powelson et al 1993 wilson et al 1995 the facility has been in operation for over 30 years with a recent expansion that includes a new set of recharge basins that have been in operation for less than 10 years the presence and reduction of viruses at this newer sat site had not yet been assessed the objectives of this study were 1 determine the presence and physical removal of naturally occurring viruses in artificially recharged groundwater 2 evaluate the performance of pmmov and crassphage as indicators of virus removal and transport during sat and 3 compare virus removal efficiency of basins with different years of operation as well as different operational parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description groundwater samples were collected from three sites within the sweetwater recharge facility swrf in tucson az during six sampling intervals that corresponded to changing weather conditions in the southwestern us fall winter spring dry early summer monsoon post monsoon the swrf contains 11 recharge basins which receive tertiary effluent achieved through a combination of dissolved air flotation as primary treatment followed by secondary treatment by two parallel modified 5 stage bardenpho systems with secondary clarification secondary effluent is disc filtered chlorinated and dechlorinated prior to either recharge operations or discharge into the santa cruz river the swrf contains a suite of production and monitoring wells throughout the facility the production wells extract groundwater from the site and distribute the water for park irrigation throughout the region monitoring wells are used for routine monitoring when necessary by the city of tucson fig 1 provides an overview of the swrf and the sampling locations sampling sites consisted of two monitoring wells wr 069b wr 398a and one production well ew 008a monitoring well wr 069b associated with the oldest set of basins one through four at the swrf is located west of the santa cruz river and southwest of the wwtp ew 008a is a production well associated with the newest set of recharge basins nine through eleven and is located east of the santa cruz river and north east of the wwtp monitoring well wr 398a is not directly associated with a specific set of recharge basins however it is in the direction of groundwater flow from the recharge facility characteristics of each site are provided in table 1 additionally tertiary effluent from the wwtp representing the source water for recharge was regularly collected from its distribution line to the basins at the swrf 2 2 virus selection adenoviruses and enteroviruses were the two human viruses selected for this study in combination with crassphage and pmmov representing a prokaryotic and plant virus respectively all selected viruses are highly abundant in human feces and wastewater ahmed et al 2018 betancourt et al 2014 farkas et al 2019 haramoto et al 2018 kitajima et al 2014 schmitz et al 2016 wu et al 2020 general characteristics of these viruses can be found in table 2 adenoviruses are a group of viruses that cause infections in the respiratory and intestinal tracts of humans they are found abundantly in treated and untreated wastewater throughout the year and are highly resistant to inactivation by uv disinfection rames et al 2016 enteroviruses are a group of viruses that infect the gastrointestinal tract and are known to circulate widely in human populations betancourt and shulman 2017 they are among the most studied viruses in wastewater and sat both adenovirus and enterovirus are listed on the epa s contaminant candidate list ccl 3 us epa 2014 pepper mild mottle virus pmmov and crassphage have been proposed as conservative indicators of fecal contamination due to their abundance in human fecal matter bibby et al 2019 pmmov is highly resistant to treatment processes and is found in wastewater effluents at 6 to 10 log10 genome copies gc per l haramoto et al 2018 crassphage recently discovered through metagenomic data mining dutilh et al 2014 is a bacteriophage that is found in high abundance in sewage as well as in treated wastewater effluent crassphage is thought to be potentially more specific to human fecal matter due to its host being a human enteric bacterial species bibby et al 2019 while pmmov has been assessed in groundwater associated with sat betancourt et al 2014 to our knowledge this is the first time in which crassphage has been assessed as an indicator of virus removal and transport during sat 2 3 sample collection and processing groundwater and treated effluent were collected six times throughout the duration of one year resulting in 24 samples total 18 groundwater 6 treated effluent sample volumes ranged from 50 to 100 and 1000 liters for treated effluent and artificially recharged or natural groundwater respectively to overcome limits of detection associated with downstream molecular analysis samples were concentrated by several orders of magnitude using methods described in ikner et al 2011 primary concentration consisted of on site filtration through electropositive nanoceram filters argonide corporation sanford fl usa filters were transported to the laboratory on ice and immediately eluted using 350 ml 1 w v sodium polyphosphate amended with 1 w v ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta and 0 01 v v tween 80 within 24 h of primary concentration filter eluates were further concentrated to volumes of approximately one ml or less using centricon plus 70 millipore sigma burlington ma 100 000 nominal molecular weight limit centrifugal ultrafiltration units previous studies evaluating these methods have indicated recovery values for various enteric viruses and ms2 bacteriophage ranging from 17 to 83 depending on the virus analyzed ikner et al 2011 extraction of nucleic acids from sample concentrates was performed using qiaamp ultrasens virus kit qiagen hilden germany per manufacturer s instructions each nucleic acid extraction event included a 1 ml 0 01 m phosphate buffered saline blank which was used as a control to ensure that cross contamination did not occur during extractions 2 4 virus detection the presence of virus in samples was assessed by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr one half of the examined nucleic acid extracts from each sample underwent reverse transcription rt with random primers using high capacity cdna reverse transcription kit applied biosystems foster city ca usa for production of complimentary dna cdna and subsequent detection of rna viruses by qpcr real time amplification was performed using a lightcycler 480 instrument ii roche applied science indianapolis in usa reactions contained 12 5 μl lightcycler 480 probes master mix roche diagnostics 5 μl template and primers and probes as needed per specific assay for a final volume of 25 μl specific assay parameters are provided in table s1 reaction reagents were prepared in a separated pcr clean room containing a reagent preparation hood which was uv treated for 15 min before and after reagent preparation template dna was added to reaction mixtures in a separate room and hood dedicated to template addition target standards in the form of double stranded dna fragments i e gblock gene fragments synthesized by integrated dna technologies coralville iowa were included in each run for absolute quantification no template controls consisting of nuclease free water were also included in each run to assess for cross contamination during qpcr fluorescence data was analyzed using lightcycler 480 software version 1 5 qpcr inhibition was evaluated using 1x and 1 10 dilutions of the template spiked with 105 gc of a gblock gene fragment internal control in tandem with spiked nuclease free water triplicate wells of each spiked dilution and water were assessed by qpcr if the 1x dilution spiked with an internal control was found to have a cycle threshold ct significantly less than the water spike greater than the value of the calibration curve slope i e less than 10 of the spiked concentration the sample was considered inhibited and a 1 10 dilution of the template was performed prior to rt and or qpcr if the 1 10 dilution met the same criteria a 1 100 dilution was performed 2 5 statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed using r version 3 6 1 with α 0 05 one way analysis of variance was used to determine significant differences in physicochemical data across different sampling locations tukey s range test was performed to analyze which of the sampling locations exhibited significant differences in physicochemical parameters spearman s correlation coefficients were determined to assess the relationship between concentrations of potential indicator viruses and human pathogenic viruses 3 results and discussion from september 2017 to november 2018 samples were collected every two to four months from each location for a total of six sampling events accounting for any differences in seasonality or recharge patterns treated effluent samples were also collected during each sampling event at a point prior to its distribution to the basins specific information regarding travel time from basin discharge to well head could not be estimated and implemented into the sampling scheme due to the complexities of the pumping configurations as well as the presence of impermeable clay lenses located throughout the vadose zone the complexities of the infiltration patterns and groundwater flows at the swrf has been documented in previous studies quanrud et al 2003b the swrf contains several production and monitoring wells with many production wells pumping concurrently during peak months which can interfere with groundwater travel times and trajectories therefore virus levels in the treated effluent were averaged for calculation of average lrvs at each well three out of the four virus targets assessed in this study were detected in the treated effluent table 3 both pmmov and crassphage were detected in 100 of the samples while adenoviruses were detected in nearly every sample however enteroviruses were not detected in any of the treated effluent samples which was consistent with results found by schmitz et al 2016 examining effluent in the same region in groundwater associated with sat pmmov and crassphage were detected in 22 and 6 of samples respectively adenovirus and enterovirus were not detected in any groundwater samples average log10 concentrations broken down by sampling site are provided in fig 2 the treated effluent which is transported to the recharge basins contained three of the four virus targets pmmov was found at the highest levels in the effluent at an average level of 6 6 log10 gc per l adenoviruses had an average concentration of 3 6 log10 gc per l both of these findings are consistent with previous studies betancourt et al 2014 schmitz et al 2016 crassphage which had not yet been assessed in wastewater effluents in southern arizona was present at an average concentration of 4 4 log10 gc per l samples collected from ew 008a associated with recharge basins nine through eleven were found positive for pmmov two of six samples and crassphage one of six samples with average concentrations of 0 8 and 0 5 log10 gc per l respectively pmmov was also detected in two out of the six samples collected from wr 398a located downstream in the direction of groundwater flow from the recharge facility with an average concentration of 0 8 log10 gc per l none of the groundwater samples were found to contain adenoviruses or enteroviruses none of the samples collected at wr 069b a monitoring well associated with recharge basins one through four were determined to contain any of the virus targets above the limit of quantification prior to this study groundwater at this site was monitored for the duration of five months table s2 eight samples were processed with sample volumes ranging from 500 to 1500 l only one of the eight samples collected from wr 069b indicated the presence of pmmov none of the samples were found to be above the limit of quantification for either adenoviruses or enteroviruses and crassphage was not assessed as it had not yet been considered as an indicator of fecal pollution at the time of the study average concentrations of pmmov during the preliminary monitoring were found to be 0 5 log10 gc per l table 4 displays the average lrvs for each virus target at each sampling location greater than values indicated that none of the six samples were positive for the virus target with groundwater values calculated using the limit of quantification divided by the square root of two methods for handling left censored data that did not involve substitution were unable to be utilized due to the low number of sampling events and high levels of censorship 66 100 overall lrvs ranged from greater than 3 4 to greater than 6 2 pmmov regularly exhibited the greatest lrvs 5 8 to 6 2 while crassphage exhibited the lowest lrv 3 9 despite the presence of pmmov at wr 069b during the preliminary study viruses were not detected from this well for the duration of the longer term study virus removal at the basins associated with this well has been documented since their construction pilot scale mini basins were originally constructed at this site which were able to demonstrate removal of bacteriophages ms2 and prd1 at least 2 logs within the first 15 feet of travel gerba et al 1991 wilson et al 1995 were unable to detect any infectious enteroviruses from groundwater in a three year study conducted at this site sampling during peak recharge season additionally betancourt et al 2014 were unable to detect any viruses by qpcr from this specific well with lrvs in agreement with the current study however average turbidity values at this well were significantly different from ew 008a p 0 03 tukey s range test and concentrates usually exhibited a bright red color unlike groundwater from the other included sampling sites this well was no longer in use for regular monitoring purposes and it is likely the turbidity experienced at this site was due to eroding well casings therefore it is unclear whether there may have been any interferences during sample collection and processing particularly when considering the presence of pmmov in the earlier preliminary study in which wr 069b was still being pumped more regularly this specific sampling site has historical context due to the numerous studies conducted there as described previously however the extent of well performance and operation is worth considering in future groundwater studies for better interpretation of results in contrast to wr 069b groundwater extracted at ew 008a was positive for both pmmov and crassphage this well is associated with recharge basins 9 through 11 which have been in operation for less than 10 years basins 1 through 4 associated with wr 069b have been in operation for over 30 years interestingly ew 008a extracts groundwater from depths twice as deep as wr 069b which might imply this groundwater has been retained underground for a longer duration and thus would allow for greater virus reduction however infiltration rates at basins 9 through 11 were almost twice as great as basins 1 through 4 column studies have indicated that higher infiltration rates facilitate greater virus transport due to reduction in retention time which may explain the increased detection at groundwater from this site betancourt et al 2019 gerba et al 1991 powelson et al 1993 additionally both sets of basins are operated at different wet dry cycles basins 1 through 4 wr 069b have a wet to dry ratio of 1 wet day followed by 14 dry days basins 9 through 11 ew 008a have a wet to dry ratio of 1 wet day followed by 4 dry days this difference in wet dry cycling could potentially have played a role in virus transport through the vadose zone wetting and drying cycles have the ability to change the subsurface redox zonation dutta et al 2015 which could likely influence removal ability as adsorption to soil particles is a large factor in subsurface virus transport betancourt et al 2019 to the best of our knowledge the influence of wetting drying cycles on pathogen or indicator removal has not yet been explored however there is evidence that longer drying periods have shown an increased capacity for removal of other groups of compounds such as dissolved organic carbon and total kjeldahl nitrogen ben moshe et al 2020 there is greater operational control over this factor during sat therefore a better understanding of its influence on virus removal would be worthwhile while groundwater flow in this area is complex due to the number of production wells pumping at any given time the overall flow of the groundwater in the region is southeast to northwest quanrud et al 2003b wr 398a is located roughly 0 65 km northwest of basins 9 through 11 and is considered downstream in terms of groundwater flow samples from this well were collected at 40 m below ground on average about half as deep as ew 008a pmmov was found in two samples from this well indicating potential virus transport through the groundwater however this well is located approximately 150 m from the santa cruz river and one km from a point at which tertiary effluent is discharged into the dry riverbed resulting in an effluent dominant flow which might facilitate virus transport downstream betancourt et al 2014 examined an effluent dominated river in colorado and were able to detect pmmov in wells located 18 miles downstream of the discharge point at distances up to 100 m adjacent to the riverbed therefore we were unable to determine whether the pmmov detected at wr 398a was from groundwater flow directly associated with sat or perhaps due to riverbank filtration along the santa cruz river in either scenario the presence of pmmov at this well indicates the potential for managed aquifer recharge practices to impact the groundwater quality in the surrounding areas throughout the study pmmov was consistently found in the highest concentrations in treated effluent by at least one order of magnitude compared to other virus targets it was found in two instances at ew 008a as well as wr 398a and one time in wr 069b during the preliminary study or roughly a 19 prevalence in groundwater associated with sat the presence of any other virus in groundwater without the presence of pmmov at a higher concentration was not observed during this study this is in agreement with numerous studies evaluating pmmov as an indicator of fecal pollution in either wastewater or the environment kitajima et al 2018 the overall abundance of pmmov in feed water as well as its persistence in recovered groundwater shown in this study provides evidence for the potential use of pmmov as a conservative process indicator of virus removal during sat for attribution of lrv credits pmmov has been proven to be a useful process indicator for other wastewater treatment processes including but not limited to activated sludge and 5 stage modified bardenpho systems kitajima et al 2014 schmitz et al 2016 as well as entire drinking water schemes kato et al 2018 additionally due to its detection in groundwater in areas surrounding the recharge facility it has shown potential as a conservative indicator of virus transport through groundwater associated with anthropogenic uses its potential for modeling the transport of pathogens specifically would depend largely on a correlation of its behavior to human pathogenic viruses pmmov has physical attributes unlike human enteric viruses that might facilitate its persistence therefore it is of value to understand its behavioral relationship to pathogenic viruses spearman s rank correlation of pmmov and adenovirus was performed on treated effluent data collected in this study and found no correlation ρ 0 086 due to the inability to detect human pathogenic viruses this analysis could not be performed for groundwater samples however pmmov has shown relatively strong correlations to human pathogenic viruses in other studies kato et al 2018 schmitz et al 2016 shirasaki et al 2017 tandukar et al 2020 despite our inability to determine a relationship of pmmov to adenovirus the sheer abundance and persistence of pmmov may serve as valuable features to consider this virus as a conservative indicator of virus removal or transport crassphage was also evaluated as a potential indicator of virus removal by sat similar to pmmov it appears to occur abundantly in wastewater effluents and therefore would allow for a non spiked process indicator for lrv credit attribution farkas et al 2019 tandukar et al 2020 despite its persistence through wastewater treatment and during sat as indicated by its presence in groundwater at ew 008a crassphage was not found as abundantly as pmmov however this study implemented a qpcr assay developed with integrated dna technologies coralville iowa in mid 2017 targeting the phage tail collar fiber protein table s3 prior to the wide acceptance of qpcr assays cpq 064 and cpq 056 developed and evaluated in stachler et al 2017 preliminary research evaluating this assay in treated effluent in the tucson region had shown promising potential fig s1 therefore it was originally included in the study it is currently unclear whether or not the selection of a different assay might influence values detected by qpcr nevertheless crassphage did exhibit the lowest lrv in the study 3 9 lower than pmmov therefore it also has potential as a conservative indicator of virus removal additionally crassphage exhibited a positive but not statistically significant correlation with adenovirus ρ 0 54 this is in agreement with studies that found statistical correlations between crassphage and human viruses farkas et al 2019 tandukar et al 2020 further sampling events and potentially the exploration of different crassphage qpcr assays might reveal further insights into the use of crassphage as a process indicator during sat the number of sampling events in this study was relatively low n 6 therefore a more extensive sample set would provide more insight about these findings it is particularly important to incorporate larger sample numbers into the evaluation of potential indicator organisms of sat performance however the costs of analysis and coordination of sampling schemes with the corresponding operational personnel needs to be considered in future studies the development of cost effective methods which can be utilized to effectively analyze large volumes of water 500 l necessary in groundwater studies would greatly improve our ability to determine appropriate indicator organisms of virus transport during soil based natural treatment processes from an operational standpoint a conservative indicator of virus removal which naturally occurs within the system alleviates any need to perform spiked tracer studies to evaluate system performance further studies evaluating potential viral indicators would greatly benefit advanced treatment operations as the objective of this study was to evaluate physical removal of viruses infectivity assays for human enteric viruses were not included the use of qpcr allows for rapid quantification of target nucleic acid sequences in various sample types its use in this study allowed for quantification of newly discovered viruses such as crassphage which currently is not culturable while this has proved to be an extremely useful tool for virus detection it is unable at this time to assess infectivity previous studies have indicated that molecular techniques such as qpcr are often correlated with infectious virus values in groundwater and are thus suited for such studies espinosa et al 2008 in addition to its inability to assess infectivity qpcr is also sensitive to inhibition by many different substances found in environmental samples such as humic acids gentry shields et al 2013 because of this necessary quality control steps were included in this study which allowed for management of inhibited samples namely diluting the nucleic acids until a signal was determined however diluting the sample can inadvertently lead to results that fall beneath the assay limit of detection every groundwater sample in this study exhibited qpcr inhibition which was alleviated by a 10 fold dilution of the final sample prior to analysis by qpcr however this also reduced the equivalent volume assayed 10 fold reducing the utility of a 1000 l sample volume concentration and extraction methods which might reduce the amount of inhibitors present in the final concentrated sample volume would increase the quality of virus reduction studies which require large sample volumes to overcome detection limits inherent to qpcr 4 conclusions two viral indicators pmmov and crassphage were detected in groundwater more frequently from an sat site that exhibited both increased infiltration rates as well as shorter wetting drying cycles this is the first evaluation of the effect of wetting drying cycles on virus removal by sat revealing an operational parameter that would benefit from further study human pathogenic viruses were not detected in any of the groundwater associated with sat pmmov was consistently detected in the highest concentrations in both treated effluent and groundwater yet did not correlate well with the adenovirus despite this its abundance and persistence make this virus a valuable candidate as a process indicator for log removal attribution in reuse schemes as it represents a case conservative to human health crassphage also showed promising potential as a conservative process indicator during sat due to its prevalence in treated wastewater and stronger correlation to adenovirus concentrations this is the first study to utilize crassphage as a tool for assessing virus removal during sat additionally pmmov was found downstream of the recharge facility indicating the potential of managed aquifer recharge of treated wastewater to impact the microbial water quality of surrounding areas

combination with crassphage and pmmov representing a prokaryotic and plant virus respectively all selected viruses are highly abundant in human feces and wastewater ahmed et al 2018 betancourt et al 2014 farkas et al 2019 haramoto et al 2018 kitajima et al 2014 schmitz et al 2016 wu et al 2020 general characteristics of these viruses can be found in table 2 adenoviruses are a group of viruses that cause infections in the respiratory and intestinal tracts of humans they are found abundantly in treated and untreated wastewater throughout the year and are highly resistant to inactivation by uv disinfection rames et al 2016 enteroviruses are a group of viruses that infect the gastrointestinal tract and are known to circulate widely in human populations betancourt and shulman 2017 they are among the most studied viruses in wastewater and sat both adenovirus and enterovirus are listed on the epa s contaminant candidate list ccl 3 us epa 2014 pepper mild mottle virus pmmov and crassphage have been proposed as conservative indicators of fecal contamination due to their abundance in human fecal matter bibby et al 2019 pmmov is highly resistant to treatment processes and is found in wastewater effluents at 6 to 10 log10 genome copies gc per l haramoto et al 2018 crassphage recently discovered through metagenomic data mining dutilh et al 2014 is a bacteriophage that is found in high abundance in sewage as well as in treated wastewater effluent crassphage is thought to be potentially more specific to human fecal matter due to its host being a human enteric bacterial species bibby et al 2019 while pmmov has been assessed in groundwater associated with sat betancourt et al 2014 to our knowledge this is the first time in which crassphage has been assessed as an indicator of virus removal and transport during sat 2 3 sample collection and processing groundwater and treated effluent were collected six times throughout the duration of one year resulting in 24 samples total 18 groundwater 6 treated effluent sample volumes ranged from 50 to 100 and 1000 liters for treated effluent and artificially recharged or natural groundwater respectively to overcome limits of detection associated with downstream molecular analysis samples were concentrated by several orders of magnitude using methods described in ikner et al 2011 primary concentration consisted of on site filtration through electropositive nanoceram filters argonide corporation sanford fl usa filters were transported to the laboratory on ice and immediately eluted using 350 ml 1 w v sodium polyphosphate amended with 1 w v ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta and 0 01 v v tween 80 within 24 h of primary concentration filter eluates were further concentrated to volumes of approximately one ml or less using centricon plus 70 millipore sigma burlington ma 100 000 nominal molecular weight limit centrifugal ultrafiltration units previous studies evaluating these methods have indicated recovery values for various enteric viruses and ms2 bacteriophage ranging from 17 to 83 depending on the virus analyzed ikner et al 2011 extraction of nucleic acids from sample concentrates was performed using qiaamp ultrasens virus kit qiagen hilden germany per manufacturer s instructions each nucleic acid extraction event included a 1 ml 0 01 m phosphate buffered saline blank which was used as a control to ensure that cross contamination did not occur during extractions 2 4 virus detection the presence of virus in samples was assessed by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr one half of the examined nucleic acid extracts from each sample underwent reverse transcription rt with random primers using high capacity cdna reverse transcription kit applied biosystems foster city ca usa for production of complimentary dna cdna and subsequent detection of rna viruses by qpcr real time amplification was performed using a lightcycler 480 instrument ii roche applied science indianapolis in usa reactions contained 12 5 μl lightcycler 480 probes master mix roche diagnostics 5 μl template and primers and probes as needed per specific assay for a final volume of 25 μl specific assay parameters are provided in table s1 reaction reagents were prepared in a separated pcr clean room containing a reagent preparation hood which was uv treated for 15 min before and after reagent preparation template dna was added to reaction mixtures in a separate room and hood dedicated to template addition target standards in the form of double stranded dna fragments i e gblock gene fragments synthesized by integrated dna technologies coralville iowa were included in each run for absolute quantification no template controls consisting of nuclease free water were also included in each run to assess for cross contamination during qpcr fluorescence data was analyzed using lightcycler 480 software version 1 5 qpcr inhibition was evaluated using 1x and 1 10 dilutions of the template spiked with 105 gc of a gblock gene fragment internal control in tandem with spiked nuclease free water triplicate wells of each spiked dilution and water were assessed by qpcr if the 1x dilution spiked with an internal control was found to have a cycle threshold ct significantly less than the water spike greater than the value of the calibration curve slope i e less than 10 of the spiked concentration the sample was considered inhibited and a 1 10 dilution of the template was performed prior to rt and or qpcr if the 1 10 dilution met the same criteria a 1 100 dilution was performed 2 5 statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed using r version 3 6 1 with α 0 05 one way analysis of variance was used to determine significant differences in physicochemical data across different sampling locations tukey s range test was performed to analyze which of the sampling locations exhibited significant differences in physicochemical parameters spearman s correlation coefficients were determined to assess the relationship between concentrations of potential indicator viruses and human pathogenic viruses 3 results and discussion from september 2017 to november 2018 samples were collected every two to four months from each location for a total of six sampling events accounting for any differences in seasonality or recharge patterns treated effluent samples were also collected during each sampling event at a point prior to its distribution to the basins specific information regarding travel time from basin discharge to well head could not be estimated and implemented into the sampling scheme due to the complexities of the pumping configurations as well as the presence of impermeable clay lenses located throughout the vadose zone the complexities of the infiltration patterns and groundwater flows at the swrf has been documented in previous studies quanrud et al 2003b the swrf contains several production and monitoring wells with many production wells pumping concurrently during peak months which can interfere with groundwater travel times and trajectories therefore virus levels in the treated effluent were averaged for calculation of average lrvs at each well three out of the four virus targets assessed in this study were detected in the treated effluent table 3 both pmmov and crassphage were detected in 100 of the samples while adenoviruses were detected in nearly every sample however enteroviruses were not detected in any of the treated effluent samples which was consistent with results found by schmitz et al 2016 examining effluent in the same region in groundwater associated with sat pmmov and crassphage were detected in 22 and 6 of samples respectively adenovirus and enterovirus were not detected in any groundwater samples average log10 concentrations broken down by sampling site are provided in fig 2 the treated effluent which is transported to the recharge basins contained three of the four virus targets pmmov was found at the highest levels in the effluent at an average level of 6 6 log10 gc per l adenoviruses had an average concentration of 3 6 log10 gc per l both of these findings are consistent with previous studies betancourt et al 2014 schmitz et al 2016 crassphage which had not yet been assessed in wastewater effluents in southern arizona was present at an average concentration of 4 4 log10 gc per l samples collected from ew 008a associated with recharge basins nine through eleven were found positive for pmmov two of six samples and crassphage one of six samples with average concentrations of 0 8 and 0 5 log10 gc per l respectively pmmov was also detected in two out of the six samples collected from wr 398a located downstream in the direction of groundwater flow from the recharge facility with an average concentration of 0 8 log10 gc per l none of the groundwater samples were found to contain adenoviruses or enteroviruses none of the samples collected at wr 069b a monitoring well associated with recharge basins one through four were determined to contain any of the virus targets above the limit of quantification prior to this study groundwater at this site was monitored for the duration of five months table s2 eight samples were processed with sample volumes ranging from 500 to 1500 l only one of the eight samples collected from wr 069b indicated the presence of pmmov none of the samples were found to be above the limit of quantification for either adenoviruses or enteroviruses and crassphage was not assessed as it had not yet been considered as an indicator of fecal pollution at the time of the study average concentrations of pmmov during the preliminary monitoring were found to be 0 5 log10 gc per l table 4 displays the average lrvs for each virus target at each sampling location greater than values indicated that none of the six samples were positive for the virus target with groundwater values calculated using the limit of quantification divided by the square root of two methods for handling left censored data that did not involve substitution were unable to be utilized due to the low number of sampling events and high levels of censorship 66 100 overall lrvs ranged from greater than 3 4 to greater than 6 2 pmmov regularly exhibited the greatest lrvs 5 8 to 6 2 while crassphage exhibited the lowest lrv 3 9 despite the presence of pmmov at wr 069b during the preliminary study viruses were not detected from this well for the duration of the longer term study virus removal at the basins associated with this well has been documented since their construction pilot scale mini basins were originally constructed at this site which were able to demonstrate removal of bacteriophages ms2 and prd1 at least 2 logs within the first 15 feet of travel gerba et al 1991 wilson et al 1995 were unable to detect any infectious enteroviruses from groundwater in a three year study conducted at this site sampling during peak recharge season additionally betancourt et al 2014 were unable to detect any viruses by qpcr from this specific well with lrvs in agreement with the current study however average turbidity values at this well were significantly different from ew 008a p 0 03 tukey s range test and concentrates usually exhibited a bright red color unlike groundwater from the other included sampling sites this well was no longer in use for regular monitoring purposes and it is likely the turbidity experienced at this site was due to eroding well casings therefore it is unclear whether there may have been any interferences during sample collection and processing particularly when considering the presence of pmmov in the earlier preliminary study in which wr 069b was still being pumped more regularly this specific sampling site has historical context due to the numerous studies conducted there as described previously however the extent of well performance and operation is worth considering in future groundwater studies for better interpretation of results in contrast to wr 069b groundwater extracted at ew 008a was positive for both pmmov and crassphage this well is associated with recharge basins 9 through 11 which have been in operation for less than 10 years basins 1 through 4 associated with wr 069b have been in operation for over 30 years interestingly ew 008a extracts groundwater from depths twice as deep as wr 069b which might imply this groundwater has been retained underground for a longer duration and thus would allow for greater virus reduction however infiltration rates at basins 9 through 11 were almost twice as great as basins 1 through 4 column studies have indicated that higher infiltration rates facilitate greater virus transport due to reduction in retention time which may explain the increased detection at groundwater from this site betancourt et al 2019 gerba et al 1991 powelson et al 1993 additionally both sets of basins are operated at different wet dry cycles basins 1 through 4 wr 069b have a wet to dry ratio of 1 wet day followed by 14 dry days basins 9 through 11 ew 008a have a wet to dry ratio of 1 wet day followed by 4 dry days this difference in wet dry cycling could potentially have played a role in virus transport through the vadose zone wetting and drying cycles have the ability to change the subsurface redox zonation dutta et al 2015 which could likely influence removal ability as adsorption to soil particles is a large factor in subsurface virus transport betancourt et al 2019 to the best of our knowledge the influence of wetting drying cycles on pathogen or indicator removal has not yet been explored however there is evidence that longer drying periods have shown an increased capacity for removal of other groups of compounds such as dissolved organic carbon and total kjeldahl nitrogen ben moshe et al 2020 there is greater operational control over this factor during sat therefore a better understanding of its influence on virus removal would be worthwhile while groundwater flow in this area is complex due to the number of production wells pumping at any given time the overall flow of the groundwater in the region is southeast to northwest quanrud et al 2003b wr 398a is located roughly 0 65 km northwest of basins 9 through 11 and is considered downstream in terms of groundwater flow samples from this well were collected at 40 m below ground on average about half as deep as ew 008a pmmov was found in two samples from this well indicating potential virus transport through the groundwater however this well is located approximately 150 m from the santa cruz river and one km from a point at which tertiary effluent is discharged into the dry riverbed resulting in an effluent dominant flow which might facilitate virus transport downstream betancourt et al 2014 examined an effluent dominated river in colorado and were able to detect pmmov in wells located 18 miles downstream of the discharge point at distances up to 100 m adjacent to the riverbed therefore we were unable to determine whether the pmmov detected at wr 398a was from groundwater flow directly associated with sat or perhaps due to riverbank filtration along the santa cruz river in either scenario the presence of pmmov at this well indicates the potential for managed aquifer recharge practices to impact the groundwater quality in the surrounding areas throughout the study pmmov was consistently found in the highest concentrations in treated effluent by at least one order of magnitude compared to other virus targets it was found in two instances at ew 008a as well as wr 398a and one time in wr 069b during the preliminary study or roughly a 19 prevalence in groundwater associated with sat the presence of any other virus in groundwater without the presence of pmmov at a higher concentration was not observed during this study this is in agreement with numerous studies evaluating pmmov as an indicator of fecal pollution in either wastewater or the environment kitajima et al 2018 the overall abundance of pmmov in feed water as well as its persistence in recovered groundwater shown in this study provides evidence for the potential use of pmmov as a conservative process indicator of virus removal during sat for attribution of lrv credits pmmov has been proven to be a useful process indicator for other wastewater treatment processes including but not limited to activated sludge and 5 stage modified bardenpho systems kitajima et al 2014 schmitz et al 2016 as well as entire drinking water schemes kato et al 2018 additionally due to its detection in groundwater in areas surrounding the recharge facility it has shown potential as a conservative indicator of virus transport through groundwater associated with anthropogenic uses its potential for modeling the transport of pathogens specifically would depend largely on a correlation of its behavior to human pathogenic viruses pmmov has physical attributes unlike human enteric viruses that might facilitate its persistence therefore it is of value to understand its behavioral relationship to pathogenic viruses spearman s rank correlation of pmmov and adenovirus was performed on treated effluent data collected in this study and found no correlation ρ 0 086 due to the inability to detect human pathogenic viruses this analysis could not be performed for groundwater samples however pmmov has shown relatively strong correlations to human pathogenic viruses in other studies kato et al 2018 schmitz et al 2016 shirasaki et al 2017 tandukar et al 2020 despite our inability to determine a relationship of pmmov to adenovirus the sheer abundance and persistence of pmmov may serve as valuable features to consider this virus as a conservative indicator of virus removal or transport crassphage was also evaluated as a potential indicator of virus removal by sat similar to pmmov it appears to occur abundantly in wastewater effluents and therefore would allow for a non spiked process indicator for lrv credit attribution farkas et al 2019 tandukar et al 2020 despite its persistence through wastewater treatment and during sat as indicated by its presence in groundwater at ew 008a crassphage was not found as abundantly as pmmov however this study implemented a qpcr assay developed with integrated dna technologies coralville iowa in mid 2017 targeting the phage tail collar fiber protein table s3 prior to the wide acceptance of qpcr assays cpq 064 and cpq 056 developed and evaluated in stachler et al 2017 preliminary research evaluating this assay in treated effluent in the tucson region had shown promising potential fig s1 therefore it was originally included in the study it is currently unclear whether or not the selection of a different assay might influence values detected by qpcr nevertheless crassphage did exhibit the lowest lrv in the study 3 9 lower than pmmov therefore it also has potential as a conservative indicator of virus removal additionally crassphage exhibited a positive but not statistically significant correlation with adenovirus ρ 0 54 this is in agreement with studies that found statistical correlations between crassphage and human viruses farkas et al 2019 tandukar et al 2020 further sampling events and potentially the exploration of different crassphage qpcr assays might reveal further insights into the use of crassphage as a process indicator during sat the number of sampling events in this study was relatively low n 6 therefore a more extensive sample set would provide more insight about these findings it is particularly important to incorporate larger sample numbers into the evaluation of potential indicator organisms of sat performance however the costs of analysis and coordination of sampling schemes with the corresponding operational personnel needs to be considered in future studies the development of cost effective methods which can be utilized to effectively analyze large volumes of water 500 l necessary in groundwater studies would greatly improve our ability to determine appropriate indicator organisms of virus transport during soil based natural treatment processes from an operational standpoint a conservative indicator of virus removal which naturally occurs within the system alleviates any need to perform spiked tracer studies to evaluate system performance further studies evaluating potential viral indicators would greatly benefit advanced treatment operations as the objective of this study was to evaluate physical removal of viruses infectivity assays for human enteric viruses were not included the use of qpcr allows for rapid quantification of target nucleic acid sequences in various sample types its use in this study allowed for quantification of newly discovered viruses such as crassphage which currently is not culturable while this has proved to be an extremely useful tool for virus detection it is unable at this time to assess infectivity previous studies have indicated that molecular techniques such as qpcr are often correlated with infectious virus values in groundwater and are thus suited for such studies espinosa et al 2008 in addition to its inability to assess infectivity qpcr is also sensitive to inhibition by many different substances found in environmental samples such as humic acids gentry shields et al 2013 because of this necessary quality control steps were included in this study which allowed for management of inhibited samples namely diluting the nucleic acids until a signal was determined however diluting the sample can inadvertently lead to results that fall beneath the assay limit of detection every groundwater sample in this study exhibited qpcr inhibition which was alleviated by a 10 fold dilution of the final sample prior to analysis by qpcr however this also reduced the equivalent volume assayed 10 fold reducing the utility of a 1000 l sample volume concentration and extraction methods which might reduce the amount of inhibitors present in the final concentrated sample volume would increase the quality of virus reduction studies which require large sample volumes to overcome detection limits inherent to qpcr 4 conclusions two viral indicators pmmov and crassphage were detected in groundwater more frequently from an sat site that exhibited both increased infiltration rates as well as shorter wetting drying cycles this is the first evaluation of the effect of wetting drying cycles on virus removal by sat revealing an operational parameter that would benefit from further study human pathogenic viruses were not detected in any of the groundwater associated with sat pmmov was consistently detected in the highest concentrations in both treated effluent and groundwater yet did not correlate well with the adenovirus despite this its abundance and persistence make this virus a valuable candidate as a process indicator for log removal attribution in reuse schemes as it represents a case conservative to human health crassphage also showed promising potential as a conservative process indicator during sat due to its prevalence in treated wastewater and stronger correlation to adenovirus concentrations this is the first study to utilize crassphage as a tool for assessing virus removal during sat additionally pmmov was found downstream of the recharge facility indicating the potential of managed aquifer recharge of treated wastewater to impact the microbial water quality of surrounding areas

17958,eliminating pharmaceutical active compounds from source separated urine is essential for nutrient recovery and reducing the contaminant load to wastewater treatment plants however limited oxidation treatment processes have shown satisfactory performance due to strong scavenging effect of urine components this study proposed a heterogeneous catalytic system by combining biochar with peroxydisulfate pds which effectively removed sulfamethoxazole smx and its major human metabolite n 4 acetyl sulfamethoxazole nsmx in urine the performance of biochar pds was investigated in both a complete mixing reactor and a biochar packed column interestingly urine components slightly inhibited the degradation of sulfonamides in biochar suspension but significantly improved their removal in biochar packed column further investigation elucidated the pds activation process and the effects of the main urine components which explained the different results in biochar suspension and biochar packed column the biochar pds system mainly produced oh radical singlet oxygen and surface bound radicals sbr which transformed smx to products of no apprarent antimicrobial properities a cost effective two stage process was designed utilizing sbr as the major reactive species this study may help to improve the understanding of the catalytic role of biochar and provide cost effective treatment options for urine graphical abstract image 1 keywords biochar peroxydisulfate continuous flow sulfonamide urine 1 introduction there is a growing concern about antibiotic pollutants due to their frequent emergence in the environment and ability to cause the formation of antimicrobial resistant bacteria reports have shown that about 100 000 to 200 000 tons of antibiotics were consumed over the past 50 years around the world lan et al 2018 furthermore global antibiotic use is projected to increase about 15 by 2030 based on the current consumption rate klein et al 2018 the antibiotic residue in environments such as wastewater surface water groundwater and soil gives rise to concerns about adverse effects to human and wildlife bradley et al 2016 huang et al 2016 madikizela et al 2017 tran et al 2015 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are thought to be the main barrier preventing pollutants from entering the environment but traditional processes such as coagulation sedimentation filtration and disinfection are not specifically designed for micropollutants such as antibiotics and cannot achieve sufficient removal of these substances adams et al 2002 the poor biodegradability of antibiotics leads to low removal efficiency during the biological treatment and most antibiotics are released into the environment through effluent discharge and sludge disposal jiang et al 2014 urine collection from toilets was first proposed in the 1990s mainly for nutrient recovery purposes esp phosphorus the source separated urine also provides a great opportunity for low cost removal of antibiotics because urine contains the majority of antibiotics entering the wwtps while accounting for less than 1 of the total wwtp influent lienert et al 2007 moreover it was estimated that nearly 67 of 42 pharmaceuticals retained at least half of their toxicity after being extracted with urine and 24 of the investigated pharmaceuticals excrete toxicity exclusively via urine escher et al 2006 however limited research focuses on the removal of antibiotics from the urine matrix deb et al observed that more than 80 of paracetamol ibuprofen and ciprofloxacin were adsorbed from urine with biomass derived adsorbent loading of 2 g l 1 deb et al 2019 advanced oxidation processes such as ozone and ultraviolet uv hydrogen peroxide h2o2 have also been applied for the elimination of pharmaceuticals from urine dodd et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 but their application was restricted by the high capital investment and maintenance cost therefore a more cost effective technology for the removal of antibiotics in urine is needed biochar a carbonaceous material produced from the pyrolysis of biomass is recognized as a promising and low cost adsorbent for heavy metals and organic pollutants inyang and dickenson 2015 inyang et al 2016 research has shown that the production of inactivated biochar is 1000 cheaper per ton on average than activated carbon solanki and boyer 2017 biochar was often used for carbon sequestrations and soil remediation qambrani et al 2017 recently biochar based processes have been proposed for nutrient recovery and pharmaceutical residue elimination from urine solanki and boyer 2017 wang et al 2019b xu et al 2019 gradually biochar received increasing interest because of its strong adsorption efficiency of various pharmaceuticals including endocrine disrupting compounds jung et al 2013 sulfonamides sas xie et al 2014 and non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs due to its large specific surface area and porous structures jung et al 2015 the catalytic role of biochar has been reported in several previous studies which include biochar h2o2 fang et al 2014 huang et al 2016 biochar pds he et al 2019 magioglou et al 2019 wang et al 2017a 2019a biochar peroxymonosulfate pms huang et al 2018 ouyang et al 2019 and biochar peroxymonocarbonate sun et al 2018 to our best knowledge the catalytic performance and mechanism of biochar to activate pds in the urine matrix has not been investigated moreover there is a lack of information on continuous flow systems using biochar packed column which is likely the major application set up in biochar based water treatment in this study we chose sulfamethoxazole smx and its main metabolite n 4 acetyl sulfamethoxazole nsmx as target compounds because smx is one of the most frequently detected antibiotics in the environment we tested their removal efficiency by biochar pds in hydrolyzed urine urea has been hydrolyzed to ammonia and bicarbonate and a phosphate buffered solution pbs in both batch and column experiments this study mainly investigated 1 the potential of biochar based catalytic activity on pds activation for the degradation of antibiotics 2 the antibiotic removal efficiency of biochar pds technology in a continuous flow system 3 mechanisms of pollutants oxidation process 4 the effects of major urine components on the biochar pds system 5 the toxic effects of products generated by the biochar pds system on microorganisms and 6 the cost analysis this study aimed to provide new insights into antibiotic elimination by biochar based catalytic systems and the mechanism of action of carbonaceous materials on the activation of pds in an alkaline hydrolyzed urine matrix additionally this study seeks to extend the application of biochar based advanced oxidation processes in real world conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials details of the materials used in this study are provided in the supporting information si text s1 structures and chemical properties of smx and nsmx are shown in si table s1 the biochar used in this experiment was produced from the pyrolysis of cotton straw biomass under oxygen free conditions at a temperature of 350 c the biochar was aged in air for over 12 months prior to experiments the characterization of the biochar is shown in si tables s3 and s4 2 2 degradation experiment to achieve the degradation of 10 μm smx and nsmx 1 mm pds was added to both a pbs and a urine matrix with a biochar concentration of 2 g l 1 in batch experiments the composition of synthetic urine was obtained from existing literature and is shown in si table s2 the pbs was employed as a control group and had the same ph value as synthetic hydrolyzed urine ph 9 the samples were shaken for 24 h and were withdrawn at given intervals and quenched with sodium thiosulfate then the samples were treated in two different ways before analysis for half of the samples aliquots of the samples were filtered through 0 45 μm syringe filters to measure the concentration of smx and nsmx in the aqueous phase for the rest of the samples extracting agents were added to recover both the residual smx and nsmx that were adsorbed on biochar and remained in the aqueous phase methanol and sodium bicarbonate nahco3 9 1 v v were chosen as extracting agents because of their high recovery for smx 95 and nsmx 90 after a 30 min extraction period the samples were filtered and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc all experiments were conducted at least twice 2 3 column experiment the column was pre packed with 0 5 g biochar and the glass wool was placed at both ends of the column to fix the biochar and prevent it from flowing out with the liquid then the column experiments were performed with a flow rate of 0 1 ml min 1 the initial concentration of smx and nsmx was 10 μm in both pbs and the urine matrix the continuous flow setup for testing the adsorption of smx nsmx onto biochar column were conducted in the absence of pds the degradation experiments were carried out by pumping 1 mm pds in the influent the samples in both the influent and effluent were collected at fixed time intervals to test the residual concentration of both smx and pds the influx was changed every day during the degradation process considering the slow degradation of smx in the influent with the existence of pds 2 4 analytical method a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc 2030c shimadzu japan equipped with a zorbax sb c18 column 4 6 150 mm 5 μm particle size temperature of 30 0 c and a diode array detector was used to monitor the concentration of smx and nsmx the mobile phase consisted of methanol and 0 1 phosphoric acid gradient elution was used where the portion of methanol stayed at 10 for the first minute then increased to 50 from 1 min to 6 min and decreased to 10 from 10 min to 15 min the peak area of both smx and nsmx was both measured at 254 nm the concentration of pds was measured by the spectrophotometric method using potassium iodide which was modified by liang et al liang et al 2008 an electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrometer karlsruhe germany was used to determine the radicals of the biochar pds system including so4 oh and o2 by the spin trapping of 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrolidine n oxide dmpo the epr spectrometer was also used to detect the singlet oxygen 1o2 trapped by 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp detailed information for the epr analysis is shown in si text s3 to further confirm the contribution of different reactive species several quenching agents such as tert butyl alcohol tba ethanol sodium azide nan3 and potassium iodide ki were selected for quenching experiments subsequently the toxicity of sulfonamides and their transformation products were evaluated by their impacts on escherichia coli e coli atcc8739 detailed information is shown in si text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of smx and nsmx by pds in biochar suspension to determine the efficiency of biochar on pds activation for antibiotic degradation different oxidation processes were conducted for smx and nsmx removal in batch experiments including biochar alone pds alone and the combined biochar pds system fig 1 in order to distinguish adsorption and degradation i e chemical destruction both the aqueous phase and the total solvent extractable tse smx and nsmx were monitored a previous study has proved that the extraction method could obtain more than 90 recovery of sulfonamides from biochar sun et al 2018 as shown in fig 1 the degradation of smx and nsmx was negligible by pds alone and biochar alone within a reaction time of 24 h however the degradation rates were greatly enhanced when simultaneously adding biochar and pds smx was almost totally degraded within 24 h in both the pbs and the urine matrix fig 1 a and b the synergistic effects between biochar and pds was further proved by monitoring the removal of smx at different biochar and pds concentrations as shown in si fig s2 the increase of either biochar or pds resulted in enhanced removal of smx in both pbs and urine matrices the maximum removal of nsmx from the aqueous phase was around 75 in the pbs and 71 in the urine matrix of this 60 and 32 was degraded in the pbs and the urine matrix respectively the decomposition of pds also confirmed the efficient activation of pds by biochar fig 1 additionally the similar concentration profiles of aqueous smx and tse smx suggested that the oxidation process dominated the smx removal from the aqueous phase in biochar suspension fig 1 a and 1 b however the adsorption process was faster than its degradation rates for nsmx fig 1 c and 1 d because of the difference between nsmx concentrations measured in aqueous and by tse the different behaviors of smx and nsmx in the biochar pds system might be ascribed to their structural difference indeed the acetyl group in the para position of the benzene ring makes nsmx more likely to adsorb onto the biochar surface sun et al 2018 but more refractory than smx to radical species potentially produced by pds ji et al 2015 compared with the pbs the urine matrix slightly decreased the removal of smx and substantially inhibited the degradation of nsmx in contrast the decomposition rates of pds in the pbs were slower than those in the urine matrix with biochar these results may indicate that in the biochar suspension system urine components promoted the production of reactive species from pds by biochar while consuming them led to lower degradation rates of smx and nsmx 3 2 removal of smx and nsmx by pds in a biochar packed column considering the potential application of the biochar pds process in treating real source separated urine a biochar packed column was prepared to test the efficiency and durability of the coupled process in a continuous flow reaction preliminary experiments confirmed that smx nsmx and pds were stable in the feedstock within the reaction time 200 h the effluent smx and nsmx concentrations were monitored with the absence of pds the removal of nsmx due to adsorption onto biochar exhibited better results than smx in the column experiments si fig s2 indeed the immediate increase without lagging phase in the concentration of smx in the effluent suggested that adsorption could not be achieved completely before it left the column more than 60 of nsmx concentration in the influent could be removed by the biochar column within 48 h and 72 h in the pbs and the urine matrix respectively whereas such removal could only be obtained within the first 24 h for smx the adsorption rates determined in our previous study sun et al 2018 may help explain the break through profile ksmx pbs 0 23 104 m 1 h 1 ksmx urine 1 17 104 m 1 h 1 knsmx pbs 0 76 104 m 1 h 1 knsmx urine 2 49 104 m 1 h 1 in general nsmx adsorbs onto the biochar faster than smx and both sulfonamides have higher adsorption rates in the urine matrix than in the pbs although urine greatly favors equilibrium towards the aqueous phase sun et al 2018 the column adsorption study suggested it is a kinetically controlled process rather than a thermodynamically governed one fig 2 shows the degradation of smx and nsmx in the biochar column with the presence of pds continued degradation of smx was achieved during the reaction time of 168 h in the urine matrix and the removal was higher than 60 of the smx concentration until the ending of this process however significantly less smx was removed in pbs these are different trends compared to the results of the biochar suspension experiments in which urine slightly inhibited the degradation of smx fig 1 the removal of nsmx was better in the urine matrix than that in the pbs however the concentration profiles are similar to the nsmx adsorption results si fig s3 which suggest that the decrease in the concentration of nsmx in the effluent was primarily due to the adsorption process the degradation process of nsmx was likely too slow to contribute to its overall removal in the biochar column experiments the decomposition of pds in the column experiments was significantly different in the pbs and the urine matrix fig 2 c and 2 d pds decomposed at a stable rate in the urine matrix throughout the entire reaction time 168 h but with a gradually decreasing rate in the pbs during the continuous flow process although the urine matrix enhanced the decomposition of pds compared with the pbs in the biochar suspension system fig 1 it was surprising that the biochar column was able to continuously decompose pds in the urine matrix whereas the decrease of pds in the effluent was only observed in the first several hours in the pbs the different degradation trends of smx and pds in the biochar suspension and biochar column experiments may likely be caused by the inherent mechanisms of the biochar pds catalytic system however mechanistic information in previous studies is only available for biochar suspension systems in a clean matrix which does not adequately explain the phenomena in this study therefore in order to explain the different degradation features in the biochar suspension and column we would like to address the following topics related to the biochar pds system 1 the factors that affected the decomposition of pds by biochar 2 the major reactive species responsible for smx and nsmx degradation and 3 the effects of urine components 3 3 sulfonamides competed with pds for the active sites on biochar the first order decomposition rates h 1 of pds in batch experiments were calculated to determine the factors that influenced pds decomposition fig 3 primary results showed pds was stable in the pbs and urine without biochar however the decomposition of pds occurred clearly in the presence of biochar pds decomposed slightly faster in urine than in the pbs without the antibiotics interestingly when smx or nsmx coexisted with pds the decomposition rates of pds were inhibited by about 40 at 10 μm antibiotics in the pbs this observation may imply that sulfonamide antibiotics might compete for binding sites with pds on biochar in the pbs and thereby inhibit the decomposition of pds to further verify this hypothesis we conducted additional experiments to monitor the degradation kinetics of pds with 0 10 100 μm smx nsmx as shown in si fig s4 the rates of pds decomposition decreased with the increase of smx nsmx concentrations therefore the competition effect between pds and smx nsmx indeed played an important role in the biochar pds system although the reactive sites responsible for smx nsmx adsorption and pds activation were difficult to be experimentally determined they were highly likely c oh and π electron moieties and iron species on biochar surface based on previous literatures hou et al 2010 nam et al 2015 nie et al 2019 zhu et al 2019b 2019c indeed synthesized carbon materials rich in sp2 hybridized carbon structures have been proved able to decompose pds duan et al 2018 while smx nsmx have strong tendency to adsorb onto biochar through π π interactions sun et al 2018 iron species on biochar surface si table s4 complexing with the amine group of smx nsmx could also activate pds oncu et al 2015 the inhibition effects of smx and nsmx on the decomposition of pds in the pbs explained the results in the column study fig 2 in the system running with the pbs the column gradually lost its capability to activate pds due to the rapid accumulation of smx or nsmx on biochar leading to increased concentrations of pds smx and nsmx in the effluent for the urine matrix the addition of smx or nsmx did not affect the decomposition rates of pds fig 3 which explained why pds was maintained at relatively low concentrations in the column study running with urine fig 2 the effects of three major urine components cl hco3 and nh4 on the decomposition of pds were investigated subsequently the impact of each component was tested by spiking the corresponding concentrations of urine components into the pbs with the same condition as the degradation experiments and the ph value was adjusted to 9 using sodium hydroxide all major urine components were able to enhance the decomposition rates of pds by biochar without antibiotics fig 3 with the addition of smx or nsmx the decomposition rates of pds decreased with cl and hco3 but increased with ammonia therefore the overall effect of antibiotics on the pds decomposition in the urine matrix were negligible in general urine switched the sorption equilibrium of smx and nsmx towards the aqueous phase sun et al 2018 therefore fewer adsorbed sulfonamides led to minimal effects on the pds decomposition it is also interesting to note that because nsmx competed with pds for the bonding sites on biochar the removal of nsmx in the column experiment without pds slightly outperformed the experiment with pds figs 2 and si fig s3 3 4 matrix effect on the degradation of smx and nsmx the effects of the three major urine components cl hco3 and nh4 on the degradation of smx and nsmx were investigated subsequently results showed that both nh4 and bicarbonate inhibited the degradation process compared with the pbs fig 4 a and 4 b at the end of the experiments 24 h bicarbonate inhibited the degradation of smx by 5 2 and nsmx by 25 and nh4 reduced the degradation of smx and nsmx by 24 7 and 58 3 respectively the effect of chloride was not substantial suggesting the negligible effect of ionic strength on sulfonamide removal in the biochar pds system it was reported that bicarbonate could influence the oxidation of organic pollutants in multiple ways firstly the presence of bicarbonate may affect the adsorption of smx and nsmx on biochar articles indicated that bicarbonate is likely to interact with the biochar surface through negative charge assisted hydrogen bonds cahbs competing with the so2nh group of sulfonamides for sorption sites sun et al 2018 another possible explanation was the quenching effects of bicarbonate see equations 1 and 2 matzek and carter 2016 waldemer et al 2007 yin et al 2019 similarly the bicarbonate could also react with oh and generate co3 the conversion of oh to the less reactive compound would be expected to inhibit the degradation of pollutants during the oxidation process since hco3 is usually used as radical scavenger wang et al 2017b yang et al 2014 1 hco3 so4 co3 so4 2 k 6 1 106 m 1 s 1 2 hco3 oh co3 oh k 1 0 107 m 1 s 1 3 nh3 so4 nh2 so4 2 k 1 4 107 m 1 s 1 4 nh3 oh nh2 oh k 9 7 107 m 1 s 1 ammonia contributed to most part of inhibition effects on the degradation process which might be caused by the consumption of radicals the conclusion was analogous to the research of zhang et al who found the addition of ammonia to pbs could inhibit the degradation of pharmaceuticals to a large extent zhang et al 2015 ammonia reacts with oh and so4 quickly see equations 3 and 4 and generates a less reactive radical species nh2 therefore the competition of organic pollutants for the main radicals would limit the degradation of smx and nsmx in the urine matrix 3 5 major reactive species sulfate radicals so4 and hydroxyl radicals oh are usually detected in persulfate related advanced oxidation for the degradation of micropollutants ahmed et al 2012 fang et al 2015 research also indicated that radicals can be generated and confined on carbonaceous catalyst surfaces duan et al 2016 therefore to identify the reactive species existing in the biochar pds system epr spectroscopy was performed by using dmpo as a trapping agent fig 5 a dmpo oh 1 2 2 1 αh αn 14 9g signals were observed indicating that oh was formed during the reaction process however the signals of dmpo so4 αn 13 2g αh 9 6g αh 1 48g and αh 0 78g were not observed likely due to the quick conversion of so4 to oh in alkaline conditions equations of 5 and 6 lin et al 2014 xu et al 2017 furthermore radical quenching experiments were conducted to investigate the contribution of reactive species generated in the bulk solution using ethanol and tba as scavengers for scavenging so4 and oh the quenching effects were quantitatively represented in si table s5 generally ethanol usually used to quench both oh and so4 has rate constants of around 109 m 1 s 1 and 107 m 1 s 1 respectively and tba has higher reactivity with oh 108 m 1 s 1 than so4 105 m 1 s 1 si fig s5 shows that the presence of 0 1 m tba resulted in reduction of 24 and 17 smx and nsmx removal respectively in the pbs in the urine matrix the tba resulted in an 11 decrease in smx removal and a 6 decrease in nsmx removal the addition of 0 17 m ethanol showed scavenger effects similar to those of tba which indicated that oh contributed to the overall degradation of smx and nsmx in the biochar pds system while the contribution of so4 was negligible which was consistent with the epr results 5 so4 h2o oh so4 2 h 6 so4 oh oh so4 2 previous articles indicated that singlet oxygen 1o2 can be generated from the ketonic groups and the recombination reaction between superoxide and h2o yin et al discovered that 1o2 instead of traditional so4 and oh was the dominant reactive species in a sludge derived biochar sdbc pds system yin et al 2019 in this study temp was selected to trap 1o2 and the characteristic signals of the three line epr spectrum of tempo adducts figs 5 b 1 1 1 α 16 9 g confirmed the generation of 1o2 in biochar pds system however quenching experiments adding sodium azide nan3 to consume 1o2 and oh si fig s5 show that nan3 decreased the removal efficiency of smx to similar levels of those in presence of ethanol which suggested that 1o2 played a minor role in the degradation of smx in the biochar pds system the degradation of nsmx in the pbs was substantially inhibited by nan3 compared with ethanol and tba which may indicate the contribution of singlet oxygen surface bound radicals are another reactive species which potentially contribute to the degradation of smx and nsmx previous research has indicated that oh and so4 can be produced and confined on the surface of catalysts feng et al 2017 zhu et al 2019a the observation of a significant increase of intensity in the epr spectra of biochar after reaction with pds indicated that there may be reactive species on the surface of the biochar fig 5 c therefore we speculated that surface bound radicals may react with sulfonamides to confirm the importance of surface bound radicals a suspension of pds treated biochar was used to react with smx and nsmx experimental details are provided in si text s6 as shown in si fig s6 more than 20 removal of smx and nsmx by pds pretreated biochar was observed the addition of 10 mm ki a surface bound radical scavenger yoon and lee 2005 decreased the removal to less than 10 therefore the combined results verified the presence of surface bound radicals and their significant role in the degradation process of smx nsmx in the biochar pds system the involvement of surface bound radicals opened another possible treatment option for the removal of antibiotics from urine a two stage process was proposed in which sulfonamides were first removed from the aqueous phase due to adsorption by biochar followed by pds addition fig 6 shows the total residue of sulfonamides in the system immediate degradation of smx and nsmx occurred in both the pbs and the urine matrix suggesting the importance of surface bound radical species in degrading biochar adsorbed sulfonamides for practical point of view two stage process may have its benefits because it separated the urine treatment and biochar recovery spatially which may help to design flexible management of urine treatment 3 6 proposed reaction pathway based on the results in previous sections we proposed the possible degradation mechanisms of smx and nsmx in the biochar pds system as shown in fig 7 biochar activated pds to generate sbr and reactive oxygen species ros in bulk phase including singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radical in pbs whereas urine converted some of ros to carbonate radical and unreactive species sulfonamides are expected to be mainly degraded by sbr in biochar column set up and by ros in biochar suspension system generally major urine components slightly accelerated the activation of pds by biochar however with the presence of sulfonamides the decomposition of pds was inhibited due to competitive adsorption on reactive sites the accumulation of sulfonamides in the biochar column could completely inhibit the activation of pds in pbs resulting in limited removal efficiency whereas the degradation of sulfonamides was prolonged due to the inhibition effect of urine on their adsorption process 3 7 toxicity evaluation of products to determine the environmental impact of products generated by biochar pds treatment during the continuous flow experiments e coli was selected as a representative microorganism to test the toxicity of parent compounds and their transformation products so that the toxic potential of the products after the treatment with biochar pds could be delineated since the transformation products were not precisely determined it is difficult to test the toxicity of the products separately therefore testing the toxicity of a mixture of the residue parent compounds and products was practical the residue concentrations of the parent compounds after biochar pds treatment were measured and then corresponding amounts of parent compounds solution were prepared the growth inhibition effects for e coli were then determined for standard solution and the mixture solutions simultaneously the difference between the samples and the parent compounds represents the inhibition by the products the method used to calculate the inhibition percentage is shown in si text s4 as shown in si fig s7 the inhibition percentage as a function of the concentration of parent compounds indicated that the toxicity of transformation products of smx and nsmx was negligible for smx and its metabolite the inhibition of samples collected from the effluent was almost equal to or slightly lower than the inhibition of the control group this revealed that the products of the reaction in the column experiments for the biochar pds system did not retain appreciable antimicrobial properties toward the tested strain 3 8 cost analysis considering the application potential of biochar and biochar coupled technologies it s necessary to estimate the economic feasibility of the three different processes including batch experiments column experiments and two stage process experiments accordingly the expense is mainly composed of biochar production and pds purchasing as shown in si table s6 results indicated that batch experiments were more cost effective comparing with column experiments and the per capital cost of which was lower than 1 2 rmb 0 2 us dollars for treating a total volume of 45 l urine produced by one person in a month the capital cost of biochar pds process is expected to be much lower than previous proposed advanced oxidation processes such as ozone and uv based processes dodd et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 landry et al evaluated the economic cost of urine source separation for removing nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug by life cycle assessment lca they concluded that centralized treatment with ozone cost 30 more compared with conventional wastewater treatment landry and boyer 2016 if more efficient sorbent such as biochar could be used for treating source separated urine it will help to decrease the overall cost of antibiotics removal 4 conclusions biochar has been proposed to facilitate phosphate and nitrogen precipitation from urine however concerns exist that pharmaceutical residues in urine would also end up in biochar this research proposed to apply biochar activated pds to effectively eliminate antibiotic residues in hydrolyzed urine it opens an opportunity to combine previous biochar based processes to achieve nutrient recovery and urine treatment simultaneously based on the results presented the following conclusions are drawn 1 the biochar pds coupled technology efficiently removed smx and its metabolite from the pbs and urine matrix specifically the urine matrix slightly inhibited the degradation of smx and nsmx in biochar suspension but favored for the removal of antibiotics in continuous flow experiments 2 pds can be activated by biochar and decomposed at a stable rate in the urine matrix due to the minor competition effects from sulfonamides 3 the presence of hco3 and nh4 slightly inhibited the degradation of smx and nsmx by competing for reactive species in the urine matrix and the effects of cl were negligible 4 hydroxyl radicals singlet oxygen and surface bound radicals dominated the oxidation process synergistically 5 toxicity test on products indicated that biochar pds successfully reduced the toxicity of influent urine 6 biochar pds technology was confirmed to be a cost efficient approach to eliminate antibiotics from urine

17958,eliminating pharmaceutical active compounds from source separated urine is essential for nutrient recovery and reducing the contaminant load to wastewater treatment plants however limited oxidation treatment processes have shown satisfactory performance due to strong scavenging effect of urine components this study proposed a heterogeneous catalytic system by combining biochar with peroxydisulfate pds which effectively removed sulfamethoxazole smx and its major human metabolite n 4 acetyl sulfamethoxazole nsmx in urine the performance of biochar pds was investigated in both a complete mixing reactor and a biochar packed column interestingly urine components slightly inhibited the degradation of sulfonamides in biochar suspension but significantly improved their removal in biochar packed column further investigation elucidated the pds activation process and the effects of the main urine components which explained the different results in biochar suspension and biochar packed column the biochar pds system mainly produced oh radical singlet oxygen and surface bound radicals sbr which transformed smx to products of no apprarent antimicrobial properities a cost effective two stage process was designed utilizing sbr as the major reactive species this study may help to improve the understanding of the catalytic role of biochar and provide cost effective treatment options for urine graphical abstract image 1 keywords biochar peroxydisulfate continuous flow sulfonamide urine 1 introduction there is a growing concern about antibiotic pollutants due to their frequent emergence in the environment and ability to cause the formation of antimicrobial resistant bacteria reports have shown that about 100 000 to 200 000 tons of antibiotics were consumed over the past 50 years around the world lan et al 2018 furthermore global antibiotic use is projected to increase about 15 by 2030 based on the current consumption rate klein et al 2018 the antibiotic residue in environments such as wastewater surface water groundwater and soil gives rise to concerns about adverse effects to human and wildlife bradley et al 2016 huang et al 2016 madikizela et al 2017 tran et al 2015 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are thought to be the main barrier preventing pollutants from entering the environment but traditional processes such as coagulation sedimentation filtration and disinfection are not specifically designed for micropollutants such as antibiotics and cannot achieve sufficient removal of these substances adams et al 2002 the poor biodegradability of antibiotics leads to low removal efficiency during the biological treatment and most antibiotics are released into the environment through effluent discharge and sludge disposal jiang et al 2014 urine collection from toilets was first proposed in the 1990s mainly for nutrient recovery purposes esp phosphorus the source separated urine also provides a great opportunity for low cost removal of antibiotics because urine contains the majority of antibiotics entering the wwtps while accounting for less than 1 of the total wwtp influent lienert et al 2007 moreover it was estimated that nearly 67 of 42 pharmaceuticals retained at least half of their toxicity after being extracted with urine and 24 of the investigated pharmaceuticals excrete toxicity exclusively via urine escher et al 2006 however limited research focuses on the removal of antibiotics from the urine matrix deb et al observed that more than 80 of paracetamol ibuprofen and ciprofloxacin were adsorbed from urine with biomass derived adsorbent loading of 2 g l 1 deb et al 2019 advanced oxidation processes such as ozone and ultraviolet uv hydrogen peroxide h2o2 have also been applied for the elimination of pharmaceuticals from urine dodd et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 but their application was restricted by the high capital investment and maintenance cost therefore a more cost effective technology for the removal of antibiotics in urine is needed biochar a carbonaceous material produced from the pyrolysis of biomass is recognized as a promising and low cost adsorbent for heavy metals and organic pollutants inyang and dickenson 2015 inyang et al 2016 research has shown that the production of inactivated biochar is 1000 cheaper per ton on average than activated carbon solanki and boyer 2017 biochar was often used for carbon sequestrations and soil remediation qambrani et al 2017 recently biochar based processes have been proposed for nutrient recovery and pharmaceutical residue elimination from urine solanki and boyer 2017 wang et al 2019b xu et al 2019 gradually biochar received increasing interest because of its strong adsorption efficiency of various pharmaceuticals including endocrine disrupting compounds jung et al 2013 sulfonamides sas xie et al 2014 and non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs due to its large specific surface area and porous structures jung et al 2015 the catalytic role of biochar has been reported in several previous studies which include biochar h2o2 fang et al 2014 huang et al 2016 biochar pds he et al 2019 magioglou et al 2019 wang et al 2017a 2019a biochar peroxymonosulfate pms huang et al 2018 ouyang et al 2019 and biochar peroxymonocarbonate sun et al 2018 to our best knowledge the catalytic performance and mechanism of biochar to activate pds in the urine matrix has not been investigated moreover there is a lack of information on continuous flow systems using biochar packed column which is likely the major application set up in biochar based water treatment in this study we chose sulfamethoxazole smx and its main metabolite n 4 acetyl sulfamethoxazole nsmx as target compounds because smx is one of the most frequently detected antibiotics in the environment we tested their removal efficiency by biochar pds in hydrolyzed urine urea has been hydrolyzed to ammonia and bicarbonate and a phosphate buffered solution pbs in both batch and column experiments this study mainly investigated 1 the potential of biochar based catalytic activity on pds activation for the degradation of antibiotics 2 the antibiotic removal efficiency of biochar pds technology in a continuous flow system 3 mechanisms of pollutants oxidation process 4 the effects of major urine components on the biochar pds system 5 the toxic effects of products generated by the biochar pds system on microorganisms and 6 the cost analysis this study aimed to provide new insights into antibiotic elimination by biochar based catalytic systems and the mechanism of action of carbonaceous materials on the activation of pds in an alkaline hydrolyzed urine matrix additionally this study seeks to extend the application of biochar based advanced oxidation processes in real world conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials details of the materials used in this study are provided in the supporting information si text s1 structures and chemical properties of smx and nsmx are shown in si table s1 the biochar used in this experiment was produced from the pyrolysis of cotton straw biomass under oxygen free conditions at a temperature of 350 c the biochar was aged in air for over 12 months prior to experiments the characterization of the biochar is shown in si tables s3 and s4 2 2 degradation experiment to achieve the degradation of 10 μm smx and nsmx 1 mm pds was added to both a pbs and a urine matrix with a biochar concentration of 2 g l 1 in batch experiments the composition of synthetic urine was obtained from existing literature and is shown in si table s2 the pbs was employed as a control group and had the same ph value as synthetic hydrolyzed urine ph 9 the samples were shaken for 24 h and were withdrawn at given intervals and quenched with sodium thiosulfate then the samples were treated in two different ways before analysis for half of the samples aliquots of the samples were filtered through 0 45 μm syringe filters to measure the concentration of smx and nsmx in the aqueous phase for the rest of the samples extracting agents were added to recover both the residual smx and nsmx that were adsorbed on biochar and remained in the aqueous phase methanol and sodium bicarbonate nahco3 9 1 v v were chosen as extracting agents because of their high recovery for smx 95 and nsmx 90 after a 30 min extraction period the samples were filtered and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc all experiments were conducted at least twice 2 3 column experiment the column was pre packed with 0 5 g biochar and the glass wool was placed at both ends of the column to fix the biochar and prevent it from flowing out with the liquid then the column experiments were performed with a flow rate of 0 1 ml min 1 the initial concentration of smx and nsmx was 10 μm in both pbs and the urine matrix the continuous flow setup for testing the adsorption of smx nsmx onto biochar column were conducted in the absence of pds the degradation experiments were carried out by pumping 1 mm pds in the influent the samples in both the influent and effluent were collected at fixed time intervals to test the residual concentration of both smx and pds the influx was changed every day during the degradation process considering the slow degradation of smx in the influent with the existence of pds 2 4 analytical method a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc 2030c shimadzu japan equipped with a zorbax sb c18 column 4 6 150 mm 5 μm particle size temperature of 30 0 c and a diode array detector was used to monitor the concentration of smx and nsmx the mobile phase consisted of methanol and 0 1 phosphoric acid gradient elution was used where the portion of methanol stayed at 10 for the first minute then increased to 50 from 1 min to 6 min and decreased to 10 from 10 min to 15 min the peak area of both smx and nsmx was both measured at 254 nm the concentration of pds was measured by the spectrophotometric method using potassium iodide which was modified by liang et al liang et al 2008 an electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrometer karlsruhe germany was used to determine the radicals of the biochar pds system including so4 oh and o2 by the spin trapping of 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrolidine n oxide dmpo the epr spectrometer was also used to detect the singlet oxygen 1o2 trapped by 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp detailed information for the epr analysis is shown in si text s3 to further confirm the contribution of different reactive species several quenching agents such as tert butyl alcohol tba ethanol sodium azide nan3 and potassium iodide ki were selected for quenching experiments subsequently the toxicity of sulfonamides and their transformation products were evaluated by their impacts on escherichia coli e coli atcc8739 detailed information is shown in si text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of smx and nsmx by pds in biochar suspension to determine the efficiency of biochar on pds activation for antibiotic degradation different oxidation processes were conducted for smx and nsmx removal in batch experiments including biochar alone pds alone and the combined biochar pds system fig 1 in order to distinguish adsorption and degradation i e chemical destruction both the aqueous phase and the total solvent extractable tse smx and nsmx were monitored a previous study has proved that the extraction method could obtain more than 90 recovery of sulfonamides from biochar sun et al 2018 as shown in fig 1 the degradation of smx and nsmx was negligible by pds alone and biochar alone within a reaction time of 24 h however the degradation rates were greatly enhanced when simultaneously adding biochar and pds smx was almost totally degraded within 24 h in both the pbs and the urine matrix fig 1 a and b the synergistic effects between biochar and pds was further proved by monitoring the removal of smx at different biochar and pds concentrations as shown in si fig s2 the increase of either biochar or pds resulted in enhanced removal of smx in both pbs and urine matrices the maximum removal of nsmx from the aqueous phase was around 75 in the pbs and 71 in the urine matrix of this 60 and 32 was degraded in the pbs and the urine matrix respectively the decomposition of pds also confirmed the efficient activation of pds by biochar fig 1 additionally the similar concentration profiles of aqueous smx and tse smx suggested that the oxidation process dominated the smx removal from the aqueous phase in biochar suspension fig 1 a and 1 b however the adsorption process was faster than its degradation rates for nsmx fig 1 c and 1 d because of the difference between nsmx concentrations measured in aqueous and by tse the different behaviors of smx and nsmx in the biochar pds system might be ascribed to their structural difference indeed the acetyl group in the para position of the benzene ring makes nsmx more likely to adsorb onto the biochar surface sun et al 2018 but more refractory than smx to radical species potentially produced by pds ji et al 2015 compared with the pbs the urine matrix slightly decreased the removal of smx and substantially inhibited the degradation of nsmx in contrast the decomposition rates of pds in the pbs were slower than those in the urine matrix with biochar these results may indicate that in the biochar suspension system urine components promoted the production of reactive species from pds by biochar while consuming them led to lower degradation rates of smx and nsmx 3 2 removal of smx and nsmx by pds in a biochar packed column considering the potential application of the biochar pds process in treating real source separated urine a biochar packed column was prepared to test the efficiency and durability of the coupled process in a continuous flow reaction preliminary experiments confirmed that smx nsmx and pds were stable in the feedstock within the reaction time 200 h the effluent smx and nsmx concentrations were monitored with the absence of pds the removal of nsmx due to adsorption onto biochar exhibited better results than smx in the column experiments si fig s2 indeed the immediate increase without lagging phase in the concentration of smx in the effluent suggested that adsorption could not be achieved completely before it left the column more than 60 of nsmx concentration in the influent could be removed by the biochar column within 48 h and 72 h in the pbs and the urine matrix respectively whereas such removal could only be obtained within the first 24 h for smx the adsorption rates determined in our previous study sun et al 2018 may help explain the break through profile ksmx pbs 0 23 104 m 1 h 1 ksmx urine 1 17 104 m 1 h 1 knsmx pbs 0 76 104 m 1 h 1 knsmx urine 2 49 104 m 1 h 1 in general nsmx adsorbs onto the biochar faster than smx and both sulfonamides have higher adsorption rates in the urine matrix than in the pbs although urine greatly favors equilibrium towards the aqueous phase sun et al 2018 the column adsorption study suggested it is a kinetically controlled process rather than a thermodynamically governed one fig 2 shows the degradation of smx and nsmx in the biochar column with the presence of pds continued degradation of smx was achieved during the reaction time of 168 h in the urine matrix and the removal was higher than 60 of the smx concentration until the ending of this process however significantly less smx was removed in pbs these are different trends compared to the results of the biochar suspension experiments in which urine slightly inhibited the degradation of smx fig 1 the removal of nsmx was better in the urine matrix than that in the pbs however the concentration profiles are similar to the nsmx adsorption results si fig s3 which suggest that the decrease in the concentration of nsmx in the effluent was primarily due to the adsorption process the degradation process of nsmx was likely too slow to contribute to its overall removal in the biochar column experiments the decomposition of pds in the column experiments was significantly different in the pbs and the urine matrix fig 2 c and 2 d pds decomposed at a stable rate in the urine matrix throughout the entire reaction time 168 h but with a gradually decreasing rate in the pbs during the continuous flow process although the urine matrix enhanced the decomposition of pds compared with the pbs in the biochar suspension system fig 1 it was surprising that the biochar column was able to continuously decompose pds in the urine matrix whereas the decrease of pds in the effluent was only observed in the first several hours in the pbs the different degradation trends of smx and pds in the biochar suspension and biochar column experiments may likely be caused by the inherent mechanisms of the biochar pds catalytic system however mechanistic information in previous studies is only available for biochar suspension systems in a clean matrix which does not adequately explain the phenomena in this study therefore in order to explain the different degradation features in the biochar suspension and column we would like to address the following topics related to the biochar pds system 1 the factors that affected the decomposition of pds by biochar 2 the major reactive species responsible for smx and nsmx degradation and 3 the effects of urine components 3 3 sulfonamides competed with pds for the active sites on biochar the first order decomposition rates h 1 of pds in batch experiments were calculated to determine the factors that influenced pds decomposition fig 3 primary results showed pds was stable in the pbs and urine without biochar however the decomposition of pds occurred clearly in the presence of biochar pds decomposed slightly faster in urine than in the pbs without the antibiotics interestingly when smx or nsmx coexisted with pds the decomposition rates of pds were inhibited by about 40 at 10 μm antibiotics in the pbs this observation may imply that sulfonamide antibiotics might compete for binding sites with pds on biochar in the pbs and thereby inhibit the decomposition of pds to further verify this hypothesis we conducted additional experiments to monitor the degradation kinetics of pds with 0 10 100 μm smx nsmx as shown in si fig s4 the rates of pds decomposition decreased with the increase of smx nsmx concentrations therefore the competition effect between pds and smx nsmx indeed played an important role in the biochar pds system although the reactive sites responsible for smx nsmx adsorption and pds activation were difficult to be experimentally determined they were highly likely c oh and π electron moieties and iron species on biochar surface based on previous literatures hou et al 2010 nam et al 2015 nie et al 2019 zhu et al 2019b 2019c indeed synthesized carbon materials rich in sp2 hybridized carbon structures have been proved able to decompose pds duan et al 2018 while smx nsmx have strong tendency to adsorb onto biochar through π π interactions sun et al 2018 iron species on biochar surface si table s4 complexing with the amine group of smx nsmx could also activate pds oncu et al 2015 the inhibition effects of smx and nsmx on the decomposition of pds in the pbs explained the results in the column study fig 2 in the system running with the pbs the column gradually lost its capability to activate pds due to the rapid accumulation of smx or nsmx on biochar leading to increased concentrations of pds smx and nsmx in the effluent for the urine matrix the addition of smx or nsmx did not affect the decomposition rates of pds fig 3 which explained why pds was maintained at relatively low concentrations in the column study running with urine fig 2 the effects of three major urine components cl hco3 and nh4 on the decomposition of pds were investigated subsequently the impact of each component was tested by spiking the corresponding concentrations of urine components into the pbs with the same condition as the degradation experiments and the ph value was adjusted to 9 using sodium hydroxide all major urine components were able to enhance the decomposition rates of pds by biochar without antibiotics fig 3 with the addition of smx or nsmx the decomposition rates of pds decreased with cl and hco3 but increased with ammonia therefore the overall effect of antibiotics on the pds decomposition in the urine matrix were negligible in general urine switched the sorption equilibrium of smx and nsmx towards the aqueous phase sun et al 2018 therefore fewer adsorbed sulfonamides led to minimal effects on the pds decomposition it is also interesting to note that because nsmx competed with pds for the bonding sites on biochar the removal of nsmx in the column experiment without pds slightly outperformed the experiment with pds figs 2 and si fig s3 3 4 matrix effect on the degradation of smx and nsmx the effects of the three major urine components cl hco3 and nh4 on the degradation of smx and nsmx were investigated subsequently results showed that both nh4 and bicarbonate inhibited the degradation process compared with the pbs fig 4 a and 4 b at the end of the experiments 24 h bicarbonate inhibited the degradation of smx by 5 2 and nsmx by 25 and nh4 reduced the degradation of smx and nsmx by 24 7 and 58 3 respectively the effect of chloride was not substantial suggesting the negligible effect of ionic strength on sulfonamide removal in the biochar pds system it was reported that bicarbonate could influence the oxidation of organic pollutants in multiple ways firstly the presence of bicarbonate may affect the adsorption of smx and nsmx on biochar articles indicated that bicarbonate is likely to interact with the biochar surface through negative charge assisted hydrogen bonds cahbs competing with the so2nh group of sulfonamides for sorption sites sun et al 2018 another possible explanation was the quenching effects of bicarbonate see equations 1 and 2 matzek and carter 2016 waldemer et al 2007 yin et al 2019 similarly the bicarbonate could also react with oh and generate co3 the conversion of oh to the less reactive compound would be expected to inhibit the degradation of pollutants during the oxidation process since hco3 is usually used as radical scavenger wang et al 2017b yang et al 2014 1 hco3 so4 co3 so4 2 k 6 1 106 m 1 s 1 2 hco3 oh co3 oh k 1 0 107 m 1 s 1 3 nh3 so4 nh2 so4 2 k 1 4 107 m 1 s 1 4 nh3 oh nh2 oh k 9 7 107 m 1 s 1 ammonia contributed to most part of inhibition effects on the degradation process which might be caused by the consumption of radicals the conclusion was analogous to the research of zhang et al who found the addition of ammonia to pbs could inhibit the degradation of pharmaceuticals to a large extent zhang et al 2015 ammonia reacts with oh and so4 quickly see equations 3 and 4 and generates a less reactive radical species nh2 therefore the competition of organic pollutants for the main radicals would limit the degradation of smx and nsmx in the urine matrix 3 5 major reactive species sulfate radicals so4 and hydroxyl radicals oh are usually detected in persulfate related advanced oxidation for the degradation of micropollutants ahmed et al 2012 fang et al 2015 research also indicated that radicals can be generated and confined on carbonaceous catalyst surfaces duan et al 2016 therefore to identify the reactive species existing in the biochar pds system epr spectroscopy was performed by using dmpo as a trapping agent fig 5 a dmpo oh 1 2 2 1 αh αn 14 9g signals were observed indicating that oh was formed during the reaction process however the signals of dmpo so4 αn 13 2g αh 9 6g αh 1 48g and αh 0 78g were not observed likely due to the quick conversion of so4 to oh in alkaline conditions equations of 5 and 6 lin et al 2014 xu et al 2017 furthermore radical quenching experiments were conducted to investigate the contribution of reactive species generated in the bulk solution using ethanol and tba as scavengers for scavenging so4 and oh the quenching effects were quantitatively represented in si table s5 generally ethanol usually used to quench both oh and so4 has rate constants of around 109 m 1 s 1 and 107 m 1 s 1 respectively and tba has higher reactivity with oh 108 m 1 s 1 than so4 105 m 1 s 1 si fig s5 shows that the presence of 0 1 m tba resulted in reduction of 24 and 17 smx and nsmx removal respectively in the pbs in the urine matrix the tba resulted in an 11 decrease in smx removal and a 6 decrease in nsmx removal the addition of 0 17 m ethanol showed scavenger effects similar to those of tba which indicated that oh contributed to the overall degradation of smx and nsmx in the biochar pds system while the contribution of so4 was negligible which was consistent with the epr results 5 so4 h2o oh so4 2 h 6 so4 oh oh so4 2 previous articles indicated that singlet oxygen 1o2 can be generated from the ketonic groups and the recombination reaction between superoxide and h2o yin et al discovered that 1o2 instead of traditional so4 and oh was the dominant reactive species in a sludge derived biochar sdbc pds system yin et al 2019 in this study temp was selected to trap 1o2 and the characteristic signals of the three line epr spectrum of tempo adducts figs 5 b 1 1 1 α 16 9 g confirmed the generation of 1o2 in biochar pds system however quenching experiments adding sodium azide nan3 to consume 1o2 and oh si fig s5 show that nan3 decreased the removal efficiency of smx to similar levels of those in presence of ethanol which suggested that 1o2 played a minor role in the degradation of smx in the biochar pds system the degradation of nsmx in the pbs was substantially inhibited by nan3 compared with ethanol and tba which may indicate the contribution of singlet oxygen surface bound radicals are another reactive species which potentially contribute to the degradation of smx and nsmx previous research has indicated that oh and so4 can be produced and confined on the surface of catalysts feng et al 2017 zhu et al 2019a the observation of a significant increase of intensity in the epr spectra of biochar after reaction with pds indicated that there may be reactive species on the surface of the biochar fig 5 c therefore we speculated that surface bound radicals may react with sulfonamides to confirm the importance of surface bound radicals a suspension of pds treated biochar was used to react with smx and nsmx experimental details are provided in si text s6 as shown in si fig s6 more than 20 removal of smx and nsmx by pds pretreated biochar was observed the addition of 10 mm ki a surface bound radical scavenger yoon and lee 2005 decreased the removal to less than 10 therefore the combined results verified the presence of surface bound radicals and their significant role in the degradation process of smx nsmx in the biochar pds system the involvement of surface bound radicals opened another possible treatment option for the removal of antibiotics from urine a two stage process was proposed in which sulfonamides were first removed from the aqueous phase due to adsorption by biochar followed by pds addition fig 6 shows the total residue of sulfonamides in the system immediate degradation of smx and nsmx occurred in both the pbs and the urine matrix suggesting the importance of surface bound radical species in degrading biochar adsorbed sulfonamides for practical point of view two stage process may have its benefits because it separated the urine treatment and biochar recovery spatially which may help to design flexible management of urine treatment 3 6 proposed reaction pathway based on the results in previous sections we proposed the possible degradation mechanisms of smx and nsmx in the biochar pds system as shown in fig 7 biochar activated pds to generate sbr and reactive oxygen species ros in bulk phase including singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radical in pbs whereas urine converted some of ros to carbonate radical and unreactive species sulfonamides are expected to be mainly degraded by sbr in biochar column set up and by ros in biochar suspension system generally major urine components slightly accelerated the activation of pds by biochar however with the presence of sulfonamides the decomposition of pds was inhibited due to competitive adsorption on reactive sites the accumulation of sulfonamides in the biochar column could completely inhibit the activation of pds in pbs resulting in limited removal efficiency whereas the degradation of sulfonamides was prolonged due to the inhibition effect of urine on their adsorption process 3 7 toxicity evaluation of products to determine the environmental impact of products generated by biochar pds treatment during the continuous flow experiments e coli was selected as a representative microorganism to test the toxicity of parent compounds and their transformation products so that the toxic potential of the products after the treatment with biochar pds could be delineated since the transformation products were not precisely determined it is difficult to test the toxicity of the products separately therefore testing the toxicity of a mixture of the residue parent compounds and products was practical the residue concentrations of the parent compounds after biochar pds treatment were measured and then corresponding amounts of parent compounds solution were prepared the growth inhibition effects for e coli were then determined for standard solution and the mixture solutions simultaneously the difference between the samples and the parent compounds represents the inhibition by the products the method used to calculate the inhibition percentage is shown in si text s4 as shown in si fig s7 the inhibition percentage as a function of the concentration of parent compounds indicated that the toxicity of transformation products of smx and nsmx was negligible for smx and its metabolite the inhibition of samples collected from the effluent was almost equal to or slightly lower than the inhibition of the control group this revealed that the products of the reaction in the column experiments for the biochar pds system did not retain appreciable antimicrobial properties toward the tested strain 3 8 cost analysis considering the application potential of biochar and biochar coupled technologies it s necessary to estimate the economic feasibility of the three different processes including batch experiments column experiments and two stage process experiments accordingly the expense is mainly composed of biochar production and pds purchasing as shown in si table s6 results indicated that batch experiments were more cost effective comparing with column experiments and the per capital cost of which was lower than 1 2 rmb 0 2 us dollars for treating a total volume of 45 l urine produced by one person in a month the capital cost of biochar pds process is expected to be much lower than previous proposed advanced oxidation processes such as ozone and uv based processes dodd et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 landry et al evaluated the economic cost of urine source separation for removing nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug by life cycle assessment lca they concluded that centralized treatment with ozone cost 30 more compared with conventional wastewater treatment landry and boyer 2016 if more efficient sorbent such as biochar could be used for treating source separated urine it will help to decrease the overall cost of antibiotics removal 4 conclusions biochar has been proposed to facilitate phosphate and nitrogen precipitation from urine however concerns exist that pharmaceutical residues in urine would also end up in biochar this research proposed to apply biochar activated pds to effectively eliminate antibiotic residues in hydrolyzed urine it opens an opportunity to combine previous biochar based processes to achieve nutrient recovery and urine treatment simultaneously based on the results presented the following conclusions are drawn 1 the biochar pds coupled technology efficiently removed smx and its metabolite from the pbs and urine matrix specifically the urine matrix slightly inhibited the degradation of smx and nsmx in biochar suspension but favored for the removal of antibiotics in continuous flow experiments 2 pds can be activated by biochar and decomposed at a stable rate in the urine matrix due to the minor competition effects from sulfonamides 3 the presence of hco3 and nh4 slightly inhibited the degradation of smx and nsmx by competing for reactive species in the urine matrix and the effects of cl were negligible 4 hydroxyl radicals singlet oxygen and surface bound radicals dominated the oxidation process synergistically 5 toxicity test on products indicated that biochar pds successfully reduced the toxicity of influent urine 6 biochar pds technology was confirmed to be a cost efficient approach to eliminate antibiotics from urine

17959,membrane distillation md works as a potential technology for the zero liquid discharge water treatment owing to its high concentration brine tolerance the continuous accumulation of salts and metals in the md system during the zero liquid discharge water treatment inevitably posed remarkable impacts on the biofilm formation as well as the md performance hence the biofouling mechanism of md was deeply researched in this study with an emphasis on the roles of salt stress nacl and metal stress zn and fe in biofilm development the membrane flux decline of md was effectively mitigated by the appearance of nacl and zno while that was significantly aggravated under the metal stress of fe considering the serious membrane scaling caused by nacl crystals a sharp flux decline was seen for the nacl group during the later stage of md operation basing on the 16s rdna and 16s rrna analysis heat stress salt stress and metal stress all posed certain impacts on the biofouling development in the md system and a more remarkable influence was observed for metal stress under the salt stress from nacl a thin biofilm containing high biovolume of dead cells finally formed in which the bacterial community mainly consisted of halotolerant and thermophile species owing to the zn2 stress and oxidation stress mechanisms of zno the bacteria in the md system were largely dead and live bacterial community in biofilms was dominated by some gram negative species under the metal stress from fe a rather thick biofilm containing higher biovolume of live cells clearly developed in which the prevailing species could secret large amounts of eps and accumulate metabolites around cells as biological surfactants inducing aggravated membrane biofouling and high risk of membrane wetting graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane distillation salt stress metal stress microbial community succession biofouling biofilm formation 1 introduction membrane distillation md a new type water purification technology integrating membrane separation and distillation process in a single system possesses a prominent superiority in water treatment due to its better water purifying ability and less stringent membrane mechanical properties qtaishat and banat 2013 however energy consumption and membrane fouling are two main obstacles to the large scale industrial application of md technology among which the energy consumption issue can be effectively solved through the usage of several cheap energy e g solar energy geothermal energy waste heat etc khayet 2013 sarbatly and chiam 2013 like all other membrane processes membrane fouling issue as a major inefficiency of md causes a significant flux decline and severe deterioration of effluent quality and membrane performance seidel and elimelech 2002 besides the high profile issue of organic fouling and scaling liu et al 2018 qin et al 2018 zou et al 2018 membrane biofouling is also a nonnegligible problem for the md performance chen et al 2015 liu et al 2019 while the knowledge about biofilm formation in the md system is still limited it is known to all that the md is a process of high temperature and high salinity in which the foulants in feed side are largely concentrated during the md operation the highly concentrated salts and metals as well as the extremely thermal condition of the md feed side would significantly affect the microbial community structure inevitably resulting in a distinct biofilm formation compared to other traditional membrane separation technologies gryta 2002 found that the growth of microorganisms and biofouling formation in the md system was limited by the extreme operating conditions of md including the high feed temperature and high concentration of salt in the feed side hence the md biofouling may exhibit a different nature compared to that in uf mf and ro even so membrane biofouling was still a problem for the md operation since that some bacterial species could unexpectedly survive and grow at the extreme surroundings tijing et al 2015 zodrow et al 2014 gryta 2002 further evaluated the growth of different microorganisms on the md membrane and found that different microorganisms reacted differently to the fouling of md membrane additionally a previous research krivorot et al 2011 has systematically considered the possible influencing factors for biofouling development in the md system including hydrodynamics feed temperature and feed water quality of md however only the variations of flux decline and biofilm biomass under different operating conditions were surveyed in this research neglecting the changes of bacterial community structure in biofilms to deeply investigate the md biofouling zodrow et al 2014 linked the microbial community structure to biofouling of md and discovered that the seasonal succession of the bacterial community in seawater posed a distinct impact on the biofilm structure during the md treatment of seawater in our previous studies we have detailedly researched the effects of feed temperature feed water quality and feed concentration on the biofilm community structure and biofouling development in the md system at present the md system was acknowledged as a competitive technology for the near zero liquid discharge water treatment due to its high salinity tolerance and the efficiency under low grade heat tong and elimelech 2016 tufa et al 2015 in the near zero liquid discharge water treatment a continuous concentration phenomenon was observed at the feed side over the md running process inevitably resulting in a distinct impact on biofilm development in real production process the md technology would be widely applied into the near zero liquid discharge treatment of seawater industrial wastewater surface water underground water and so on wherein the salts and metals were significantly concentrated in md feed side and then caused an ineluctable influence on the biofilm formation in md system presently many studies have paid wide attention into the effects of salinity and heavy metals on biofouling development in the conventional membrane separation processes like mbr ro uf etc amiri et al 2010 huang et al 2016 jang et al 2013 wang et al 2018 it has been found that the high salinity ca and na in the mbr system could obviously change the microbial community structure in biofilms finally causing the variations of cake layer resistance on the membrane jang et al 2013 kim and jang 2006 furthermore several researchers aftab et al 2017 amiri et al 2010 armendáriz ontiveros et al 2019 investigated the impacts of heavy metals cr pb ni mn and fe on membrane biofouling and the results revealed that the existence of heavy metals in membrane separation process could effectively inhibit the bioactivity of bacteria and then reduce the biofilm layer thickness finally mitigating the membrane biofouling differently wang et al 2018 researched the effects of al and fe iii on uf membrane biofouling and found that the appearance of fe iii induced a higher secretion of eps and then promoted the biofilm formation obviously aggravating the membrane biofouling of uf it can be seen from the above mentioned previous researches that the presence of salinity and heavy metals in feed solutions indeed played crucial roles in biofouling development during the membrane separation process additionally we previously researched the md biofouling mechanism under two typical operating modes open loop mode and closed loop mode and found that the accumulation of inorganic substances in the md system clearly changed the microbial community structure in biofilms under closed loop mode liu et al 2020 while the specific influencing mechanisms of salinity and heavy metals were not deeply investigated in our previous study to our best knowledge current researches regarding md biofouling were mainly focused on the effects of feed temperature water quality and hydrodynamics while the role of salts and metals accumulation in md biofouling and the corresponding system performance has not been systematically investigated until now hence the objective of this study was to investigate the membrane biofouling mechanisms of md system considering the influence of salts and metals accumulation in the feed side during the near zero liquid discharge treatment of surface water contaminated by salts and heavy metals in the real production process the treated mining wastewaters were directly discharged to surface water in which the abundant heavy metals e g pb cr hg as fe zn etc partly polluted the surface water therefore the xuanwu lake water was chosen as initial feed solutions for the md operation in this study and the high concentration of nacl zncl2 and fecl3 solutions were selected as the supplement for feed solution during the long term md operation respectively in this way the role of salt and metal accumulation in md biofouling formation could be clearly clarified which may assist in the further development of anti biofouling materials and treatments 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment setup the schematic of a lab scale direct contact membrane distillation dcmd system is presented in fig 1 a type of commercial hydrophobic membrane of polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe was chosen for md operation in this study and its basic characteristics are listed in supplementary table s1 according to our previous research liu et al 2019 the temperatures of md feed and permeate sides were set as 60 c and 10 c respectively and the cross flow velocities of feed and permeate solutions both maintained at 10 5 mm s in this study the normalized flux nf was applied to monitor the fouling process of md which was calculated as follows 1 nf j j 0 where nf j and j 0 are the normalized flux permeate flux and initial flux respectively the permeate solution was collected and weighted by an electronic balance bs 3000 yousheng balance company china and the permeate flux data was logged into a computer every 10 min 2 2 feed solution preparation this study was aimed at the near zero liquid discharge treatment of surface water contaminated by salts and heavy metals using md technology to simulate the feed solution for md operation the xuanwu lake nanjing china supplementary fig s1 water in summer was chosen as the initial feed solution 15 l in this study to accelerate the accumulation of salts and metals in the feed side and then accurately research its impacts on md biofouling the high concentration of nacl zncl2 and fecl3 solutions 0 8 mol l for each metal were selected as the supplement for feed solution during the long term md operation three experimental groups in terms of the blank control group the di water was chosen as the supplement for feed solution during the whole md operation 2 3 analytical methods the variations of ph conductivity and toc in both feed and permeate sides were daily measured through a ph meter denver instrument america a conductivity meter dds 11a china and a toc analyzer toc vcsh shimadzu japan respectively the concentrations of metals ca na zn fe in feed solutions were measured using icp aes perkinelmer plasma 3200rl to study the variations of organics in feed solutions the uv254 and eem of feed solutions filtration through 0 45 mm were analyzed by a uv spectrophotometer uv 3000 shanghai mapada instruments co ltd and a hitachi f 7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi inc japan at the end of md operation 600 ml feed solutions extraction using 15 ml hexane 15 ml dichloromethane and 15 ml chloroform were sampled for gc ms measurement via a gas chromatography gc7890a agilent to research the changes of organic compositions in feed solutions the morphology and elemental composition of the membrane surface and cross section were investigated by a sem s 4800 hitachi coupled with eds octane plus ametek the functional group analysis of the fouled membrane surface was performed using a ftir tensor 27 bruker spectrometer with a scanning range of 500 4000 cm 1 the mineral compositions of membrane depositions were determined via a xrd instrument d8 quest bruker to research the composition of fluorescent substances in fouling layers the membrane depositions were extracted from the fouled membrane surface using di water for eem analysis at the end of md operation the fouled membrane coupons were removed from md system and immediately stained with a solution of syto 9 and propidium iodide pi according to the manual live dead baclight invitrogen to identify the ratio of live dead cells in biofilms via a confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm leica tcs sp8 inc the intracellular ros was detected by the dcfh da ros probe reactive oxygen species assay kit solarbio and then analyzed using a fluorescence microscope nikon eclipse 80i japan the area of fluorescent region was measured using image pro plus the specific description of each analytical method is presented in detail in the supplementary information section iii 2 4 high throughput sequencing and microbial community analysis at the end of each md operation the fouled membrane samples were collected from the md system and then frozen at 80 c until the dna or rna extraction methods of dna or rna extraction data processing and statistical analysis were described in detail in the supplementary information section iv all the microbiological data were accurately submitted to the sra database with a project number of srp239375 3 results and discussions 3 1 md performance 3 1 1 water quality analysis as shown in table 1 the conductivity of di group continuously maintained in a range of 0 23 0 24 ms cm during the whole md operation 360 h differently the conductivity of nacl zncl2 and fecl3 group significantly raised to the final values of 69 40 68 90 and 87 90 ms cm respectively suggesting that obvious accumulations of salts and metals indeed occurred in md feed side for nacl zncl2 and fecl3 groups additionally distinct variations of ph can also be obtained for feed solutions which finally increased to 8 95 and 7 50 for di and nacl groups respectively however the ph of feed solutions in zncl2 6 17 360 h and fecl3 0 90 360 h group clearly decreased to an acid range likely attributing to the considerable appearance of h in feed solutions caused by the hydrolyzation of zncl2 and fecl3 furthermore the toc of di and fecl3 groups obviously increased to 45 94 mg l and 46 86 mg l 360 h which might be associated with the metabolite secreted by bacteria in terms of nacl and zncl2 group a slight reduction of toc can be seen for feed solutions during the md operation table 1 highly attributing to the inhibited metabolism of microorganisms caused by the salt stress of nacl and metal stress of zn comparatively rather fewer changes of water qualities can be obtained in the permeate side except for the fecl3 group supplementary fig s2 in di nacl and zncl2 group the ph 6 61 7 02 and conductivity 1 49 20 90 μs cm of permeate solutions continuously maintained in a stable range demonstrating that the ptfe membrane could consistently play a good separation role during the whole water treatment process differently the ph and conductivity of permeate solutions in fecl3 group obviously varied to the final values of 2 91 and 790 00 μs cm suggesting that a certain membrane wetting phenomenon occurred in the md system 3 1 2 permeate flux decline as shown in fig 2 the membrane flux decline of md was effectively mitigated by the accumulation of nacl and zncl2 in feed solutions likely due to the inhibited growth of bacteria in the feed side with the continuous deposition of nacl crystals a clear scaling layer gradually formed on the md membrane leading to a sharp flux decline during the later period of md operation 216 360 h comparatively a rather significant flux decline was seen for the fecl3 group which rapidly reduced to around 0 65 at the early period 0 90 h and then maintained at a relatively low level of 0 53 0 65 90 360 h the appearance of iron ions in feed solutions could partly promote the metabolism of microbes wang et al 2018 wu et al 2012 and then aggravate the md biofouling largely accelerating the flux decline of md membrane considering the rather higher concentration of toc 46 86 mg l table 1 in the feed side significant organic fouling induced by microbial metabolites indeed occurred in the fecl3 group further contributing to the serious flux decline of md furthermore the conspicuous deposition of fe oh 3 flocculent precipitates on the membrane might be another reason for the remarkable deterioration of membrane flux which was generated from the hydrolyzation of fecl3 3 2 variations of inorganic and organic contents in feed solutions as shown in table 2 the concentrations of na zn2 and fe3 in nacl zncl2 and fecl3 group significantly increased to the final values of 22 50 g l na 29 74 g l zn2 and 36 28 g l fe3 respectively further confirming the remarkable accumulations of salinity and heavy metals in md feed side differently ca2 as the representative inorganic ion in the di group exhibited a slight decrement of concentration from 25 40 mg l 0 d to 17 70 mg l 15 d possibly due to the mild deposition of ca salts on the membrane the eem analysis was applied to explore the composition of fluorescent substances in feed solutions which revealed that the initial xuanwu lake water consisted of six kinds of fluorescent matters in region i vi supplementary fig s3 as shown in fig 3 the eem spectra of feed solutions demonstrated obvious variations with the md operation in di and nacl group the fluorescent matters in feed solutions mainly composed of tyrosine tyrosine like protein tryptophan and tryptophan like protein in region i iv besides the obvious fluorescent signal in region i iv the eem spectra of zncl2 group also exhibited clear fluorescent peaks in region v vi peak f and g the remarkable increment of fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances region v vi in zncl2 group might be highly associated with the biological processes in feed solutions in the md feed side the zncl2 compounds were largely hydrolyzed to the unstable zn oh 2 which eventually decomposed into the zno substances zno compound was widely reported to pose a certain sterilization property which could cause the apparent death of microorganisms oprea et al 2014 riaz et al 2015 hence humic substances including fulvic acid like and humic acid like compounds as the products of cell autolysis after microbial death were largely released to feed solutions in zncl2 group swaby and ladd 1966 similar results can also be obtained from the uv254 analysis supplementary fig s4 furthermore the gc ms analysis was performed to further research the changes of organic composition in feed solutions and the results are presented in supplementary fig s5 and tables s2 s8 in nacl and zncl2 group the types of organic matters in feed solutions clearly raised with the md operation which might be associated with the release of organics from dead cells under the stress of nacl and zno in comparison with the nacl 173 types and zncl2 155 types groups the fecl3 group exhibited rather fewer types of organics 75 types in feed solutions possibly attributing to the active microbiological degradation of organic substances induced by the iron element in feed side wang et al 2018 wu et al 2012 additionally the membrane wetting phenomenon in fecl3 group might be another reason for the reduced organic types in feed solutions as shown in supplementary fig s6 and tables s6 s7 the types of organic matters in permeate solutions distinctly increased from 122 1 d to 187 15 d during the md operation suggesting the occurrence of membrane wetting in fecl3 group similar results can also be obtained from the eem spectra of permeate solutions supplementary figure s2 c besides the common fluorescent matters in region i iv the humic acid like substances can also be clearly detected in the permeate side of fecl3 group further confirming the occurrence of membrane wetting in the md system in fecl3 group the feed solutions exhibited distinct corrosiveness and acidity ph of 0 90 1 28 table 1 owing to the hydrolyzation of fecl3 compounds which posed impacts on the properties of hydrophobic ptfe membrane and then destroyed the stable performance of md system 3 3 membrane fouling analysis 3 3 1 ftir analysis as displayed in fig 4 and supplementary table s9 the virgin ptfe membrane exhibited two characteristic peaks for the stretching vibration of cf2 group 1223 and 1154 cm 1 wang et al 2015 besides the two peaks of virgin ptfe membrane the fouled membranes in di group also showed other characteristic peaks at 1642 1538 1012 1000 and 916 cm 1 suggesting the existence of amide i amide ii silicate and polysaccharide on the membrane liu et al 2020 in nacl group the ftir spectra of fouled membranes demonstrated other peaks at 3293 2962 2927 2850 1734 1203 1148 695 656 and 1460 1320 cm 1 indicating the clear depositions of humic acids fulvic acids nacl and na2co3 on the membrane jönsson et al 2007 liu et al 2020 şansal and somer 1999 besides the characteristic peaks of organics the ftir spectra of fouled membranes in zncl2 group also exhibited obvious peaks of zn salts including zn oh 2 3424 3227 cm 1 zno 1444 611 600 575 and 545 cm 1 zn5cl2 oh 8 h2o 1620 900 and 730 cm 1 znco3 1510 1382 and 835 cm 1 etc ghotbi 2010 singh and gopal 2008 similarly fouled membranes obtained in fecl3 group showed distinct characteristic peaks of fe salts besides the peaks of organics such as fe oh 3 fe oh 2 fe2o3 fecl3 and fe3o4 su and suarez 1995 zhang et al 2013 basing on the ftir results it can be seen that the md membranes of nacl zncl2 and fecl3 groups were severely fouled by the mineral salts besides the organic depositions which inevitably posed nonnegligible effects on the microbial community structure in biofilms 3 3 2 xrd analysis the xrd analysis was conducted to further study the salt crystals deposited on the md membrane and the results are listed in supplementary fig s7 the virgin pttfe membrane exhibited three strong crystalline peaks at around 18 2 22 9 and 25 9 corresponding to the material of ptfe membrane as a semicrystalline polymer watanabe and akashi 2009 besides the peaks of ptfe material a weak peak at 29 8 can also be seen from the xrd spectra of fouled membranes in di group suggesting the mild deposition of calcite on the membrane tang et al 2008 hence it can be inferred that the slight attachment of calcite on the membrane might be another reason for the flux decline of di group besides the two main fouling factors of organics and microorganisms in nacl group two peaks at 31 6 and 45 5 were observed in the xrd pattern indicating the obvious appearance of nacl crystals on the membrane bai et al 2002 jiang and fan 2003 the fouled membranes obtained in zncl2 group were clearly deposited by zn salts of zno 28 9 and 31 8 and zn oh 2 20 1 20 5 24 9 26 9 32 9 40 9 and 43 0 zhang and li 2003 in fecl3 group several weak peaks at 21 2 33 2 36 6 53 2 55 8 59 0 61 3 and 64 0 can be seen from the xrd spectra of fouled membranes suggesting the existence of fe2o3 and fe3o4 on the membrane zhang et al 2013 the xrd results further confirmed that distinct depositions of mineral salts indeed occurred on the md membrane in nacl zncl2 and fecl3 groups inevitably influencing the biofilm formation in the md system 3 3 3 sem eds analysis 3 3 3 1 membrane surface analysis the virgin ptfe membrane exhibited a fibrous microporous structure supplementary figure s8 a which was gradually covered by a fouling layer with the md operation fig 5 in di group a dense cake layer containing large amounts of organics c and o 66 91 76 41 cps kev finally formed on the md membrane which might be associated with the high concentration of organics table 1 and serious biofouling in md feed side comparatively the depositions of organics on the membrane obviously reduced in nacl c and o 39 90 50 17 cps kev and zncl2 group c and o 32 09 44 78 cps kev likely due to the mitigated membrane biofouling under the salt stress of nacl and metal stress of zno in nacl group the clear appearance of nacl crystals na 12 93 cps kev see red arrow in fig 5 b1 on the membrane can be obtained at 96 h with the further md operation the membrane surface was gradually covered by a crystal layer na 20 73 cps kev leading to the sharp flux decline during the later stage fig 2 comparatively the zno crystals were later found on the md membrane in zncl2 group see red arrow in fig 5 c2 which clearly increased zn 26 68 cps kev at the later period 216 360 h differently the md membranes of fecl3 group were severely covered by a dense fe oh 3 colloidal layer and nearly no obvious crystals can be observed from the membrane surface morphology fig 5 d generally a rather milder fouling layer finally formed on the membrane surface of zncl2 group in which the fibrous microporous structure of virgin ptfe can still be seen from the 360 h operated membranes see red cycles in fig 5 c3 3 3 3 2 cross section line analysis the eds cross section line analysis of fouled membranes was performed as previously reported liu et al 2018 considering the thickness of each fouled membrane was less than 300 μm the beginning and ending points of eds cross section line analysis were set at points a and d supplementary fig s8 respectively fig 6 depicts the cross section morphologies of fouled membranes which revealed that the membranes operated in nacl and zncl2 group both exhibited a thinner fouling layer than that of di and fecl3 group in fecl3 group an extremely thicker and denser fouling layer clearly formed on the membrane consequently leading to a rather severe flux decline behavior as shown in fig 7 rather larger amounts of organics can be detected from the membrane surface as well as the pores of fecl3 group comparatively the fouled membranes of zncl2 group displayed extremely fewer depositions of organic matters on the md membrane surface or pores suggesting that a milder organic fouling behavior occurred in zncl2 group except for the fecl3 group the inorganic substances mainly deposited on the membrane surface in fecl3 group rather distinct amounts of inorganics fe can be detected from the membrane surface as well as the pores the obvious penetration of hydrophilic iron precipitates into the pores might be responsible for the membrane wetting in fecl3 group in other experimental groups the inorganic matters mainly appeared on the md surfaces which were extremely less found in membrane pores fig 7 b1 b3 compared to the zncl2 group a thicker inorganic layer obviously formed on the md membrane in nacl group revealing that a serious membrane scaling occurred in nacl group generally the md membranes in zncl2 group exhibited a quite mild fouling behavior where a thinner fouling layer containing fewer amounts of inorganic and organic foulants finally formed on the membrane 3 3 4 3d eem analysis of membrane foulants to research the compositions of fluorescent matters in membrane fouling layers the deposited foulants were extracted from the md membrane surface for eem analysis as exhibited in supplementary fig s9 the foulants deposited on the membrane prevailingly consisted of tyrosine tyrosine like protein tryptophan in region i iii which was highly associated with the interfacial interactions between different fluorescent substances and md membrane surface differently a rather obvious existence of humic acid like compounds region v was detected on the ptfe membrane surface in zncl2 group this phenomenon might be due to that the bacteria in feed side distinctly died under the metal stress of zno thus the humic acid like substances were largely released outside the dead cells and then accumulated on the md membrane oprea et al 2014 riaz et al 2015 swaby and ladd 1966 3 4 biofilm structure on the membrane surface the morphologies of biofilms developed in different experimental groups as well as the ratio of live and dead bacteria in biofilms are presented in fig 8 it can be clearly observed that a rather higher biovolume of biofilm was obtained for fecl3 group 60 85 μm3 μm2 in which the live bacteria 45 40 μm3 μm2 occupied a remarkable proportion 74 6 it might be highly due to that the iron element in feed solutions worked as an essential nutrient for the growth of microorganisms which would partly promote the microbial growth in the md feed side wang et al 2018 wu et al 2012 however compared to the di group relatively higher biovolume of dead bacteria 15 45 μm3 μm2 was also seen in biofilms of fecl3 group likely attributing to the highly hydrolysis of fe3 upon the hydrolysis of fe3 the md feed solution became relatively acidic and corrosive ph of 0 90 1 28 table 1 causing the death of some microorganisms in the feed side comparatively rather large amounts of dead cells were detected in biofilms of nacl and zncl2 group which were around 20 55 μm3 μm2 nacl and 42 80 μm3 μm2 zncl2 after 360 h of md operation under the salt metal stress from nacl crystals and zno microorganisms in the md feed side largely died leading to the higher biovolume of dead cells in membrane biofilms compared to nacl group 22 61 μm3 μm2 higher amounts of biomass were detected on the fouled membranes of zncl2 group 47 75 μm3 μm2 attributing to the later appearance of zno on the md membrane fig 5 c during the early stage of md operation relatively less zno formed on the membrane thus bacteria in feed solutions preferential attached to the ptfe membrane with the extension of md operation increasing amounts of zno deposited on the membrane significantly inducing the death of bacteria oprea et al 2014 riaz et al 2015 therefore a thicker biofilm containing extremely high amounts of dead cells finally developed on the md membrane in zncl2 group 3 5 microbial community analysis of md membrane biofilms 3 5 1 analysis of the total dna and active rna microbial community to explore the influence of salt metal stress on the biofilm formation of md and the corresponding microbial community structure the high throughput sequencings of 16s rdna and 16s rrna were conducted to analyze the total bacteria and live bacteria in md membrane biofilms respectively given the high coverage index 0 996 of each biological sample it can be proven that the sequencing depth in this study was high enough to truly reflect the bacterial community supplementary fig s10 for the nacl group the variations of otu in biofilms were relatively similar to that of the di group fig 9 a differently the membrane biofilms obtained in zncl2 360 h 586 and fecl3 groups 360 h 592 both demonstrated abundant otu compared to di and nacl groups indicating the remarkable effects of metal stress on the md biofilm structure fig 9 b the specific microbial community structure of total dna and active rna bacteria at phylum class and genus level are shown in fig 10 and supplementary fig s11 in which significant distinctions were clearly observed between raw water and md membrane biofilm samples for the raw water group x0 cyanobium pcc 6307 20 14 and 46 27 in dna and rna based samples and hgci clade 22 03 and 8 06 in dna and rna based samples were the predominant genera which could not be found in md membrane biofilm samples comparatively some other microbes such as tepidimonas enriched in both di and nacl group meiothermus enriched in both di and nacl group sphingobium enriched in both zncl2 and fecl3 group env ops 17 norank enriched in di group curvibacter enriched in di group olb14 norank enriched in nacl group pelomonas enriched in zncl2 group novosphingobium enriched in zncl2 group sphingomonas enriched in zncl2 group and bradyrhizobium enriched in fecl3 group were found abundant in md membrane biofilms tepidimonas and meiothermus were two representative genera in md membrane biofilms developed under di and nacl groups in the raw water nearly no tepidimonas and meiothermus can be detected in both dna and rna based samples while these two genera clearly existed on the md membrane and especially the abundances of tepidimonas and meiothermus in di 5 15 19 36 and 21 52 48 44 respectively and nacl group 2 53 17 61 and 12 60 27 30 respectively were significantly higher than that of zncl2 0 01 0 50 and 0 53 4 65 respectively and fecl3 group 0 02 0 46 and 0 07 1 18 respectively additionally the above mentioned genera of tepidimonas and meiothermus still demonstrated rather obvious proportions in rna based samples after 360 h of md operation under di and nacl group these two genera of tepidimonas and meiothermus as thermophilic and biofilm developing bacteria were widely found in hot spring with optimum growth temperatures of around 55 60 c tepidimonas and 40 70 c meiothermus respectively chen et al 2002 2006 considering the high operating temperature of md process 60 c these thermophilic bacteria which prefer thermal circumstances were predicted to be enriched in the md system however compared with the di group the abundance of active tepidimonas and meiothermus were relatively lower in the nacl group suggesting that the metabolism process of tepidimonas and meiothermus in md system was partly limited by the salt stress of highly concentrated nacl solution recent researches also found that nacl solution with a concentration higher than 1 would not be beneficial for the growth of thermophilic bacteria like tepidimonas and meiothermus albuquerque et al 2009 habib et al 2018 significantly different from the di and nacl group the genera of tepidimonas and meiothermus almost disappeared from md system under the zncl2 and fecl3 groups evidently indicating that zn2 and fe3 indeed posed a remarkable metal stress on the growth of tepidimonas and meiothermus in md system and directly determined the subsistence of these thermophilic genera zhu et al 2010 sphingobium sphingomonas and novosphingobium defining as gram negative alphaproteobacteria were other organisms that merit attention as they were found in abundance only in zncl2 group and fecl3 group 6 22 39 02 and 22 04 26 34 for zncl2 and fecl3 group respectively comparatively the above mentioned three genera were nearly undetected in the di group 1 41 and nacl group 0 15 indicating that these special bacteria posed a tendency to live in metal rich environments owning to the diverse environmental adaptations and biodegradative capabilities the sphingobium sphingomonas and novosphingobium genera have been widely applied into the degradation of contaminants like pahs as well as the soil remediation especially the heavy metal contaminated industrial soils thus it can be seen that these bacteria indeed posed a certain tolerance to heavy metals like zn and fe chen et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 however compared with the total microbial community dna the abundance of sphingobium was much lower in the active microbial community rna suggesting that sphingobium was a predominant genus only in the early stage of md process and it could not survive in zncl2 and fecl3 groups for a long time the gradually formed zno and fe3o4 in the md system would pass through the cytomembrane of sphingobium and then cause the dna damage sun et al 2017 leading to the significant disappearance of active sphingobium in zncl2 and fecl3 groups during the later stage of md operation pelomonas a gram negative betaproteobacteria enriched in both dna and rna based samples from the zncl2 group was observed to be an absolutely predominant genus 36 48 37 95 in md membrane biofilms that formed under zncl2 group as reported by miao et al 2019 pelomonas was an oxidative stress tolerant genus owning an ability to resist the great oxidative stress from zno substances furthermore another genus of anoxybacillus can also be largely found in the zncl2 group with an abundant proportion of around 13 40 in rna based samples anoxybacillus a gram positive bacterium was able to produce spores with special resistance to various adverse environments which could well adapt to the extreme changes of temperature ph and salinity khairuddin et al 2016 the optimum growth temperature of anoxybacillus was around 54 c and it can well survive even at a high temperature of 64 c khairuddin et al 2016 comparatively the abundance of anoxybacillus in rna based samples 13 40 was obviously lower than that of pelomonas 37 95 which might be highly attributed to the gram positive characteristic of anoxybacillus in a near neutral or alkalescent environment the gram positive organisms were more negatively charged than the gram negative bacteria owning to the dissolution of free zn2 from zno the positively charged zno particle would easily adsorb the more negatively charged gram positive anoxybacillus bacteria to its surface and then killed them liu et al 2011 under the fecl3 group large amounts of pathogenic bacteria were detected in md membrane biofilms including escherichia shigella 5 09 11 83 faecalibacterium 1 18 6 84 and bacteroides 1 53 7 20 suggesting that iron element might be able to promote the metabolism of pathogenic microorganisms in md system additionally other organisms containing bradyrhizobium 7 69 caulobacter 11 54 herbaspirillum 11 54 and microbacteriaceae unclassified 34 62 were all found abundant in rna based samples fig 10 d and these bacteria could easily move to md membrane surface through their well developed flagella bradyrhizobium a gram negative genus was widely reported to pose the ability of sufficiently absorbing iron element in the environment through the secretion of siderophore as well as the genetic expression of ferric siderophore receptor gene abd alla 1998 guerinot et al 1990 lesueur et al 1993 small et al 2009 as reported by corzo et al 1994 the bradyrhizobium genus was able to secrete abundant extracellular mucus with the main components of polysaccharides and peptides which would consequentially aggravate the membrane fouling of md system besides caulobacter a gram negative genus could adhere tightly to the ptfe membrane surface via its holdfast further exacerbating the membrane fouling phenomenon in the md system li et al 2013 microbacteriaceae unclassified a absolutely dominant bacterium in fecl3 group was widely found to pose the ability of resisting salts heat heavy metals and extreme ph conditions cavalca et al 2010 kim et al 2011 zhang et al 2010 thus abundant microbacteriaceae unclassified bacteria were detected in md system some species belonging to microbacteriaceae unclassified genus could secrete large amounts of exopolysaccharides epss godinho and bhosle 2009 significantly promoting the md membrane fouling under fecl3 group moreover some microbacteriaceae unclassified bacteria accumulated metabolites specific glycolipids around cells as biological surfactants palme et al 2010 upon the attachment of these organisms onto the md membrane the biological surfactants around cells would seriously reduce the surface tension of hydrophobic ptfe membrane thus promoted the occurrence of membrane wetting phenomenon in the md system besides the tepidimonas and meiothermus some other active microbes like olb14 norank 11 22 chelatococcus 16 55 bacillaceae uncultured 10 38 and anoxybacillus 6 17 were also obviously found in nacl group which were reported to pose the ability of living in the extreme circumstances of high temperature and high salinity panday and das 2010 yang and zhou 2014 in terms of di group abundant genera of curvibacter geobacillus and env ops 17 norank also existed in md membrane biofilms besides the tepidimonas and meiothermus geobacillus was reported to be a thermophilic and biofilm forming bacterium which was widely found in hot spring with the optimum growth temperature of 60 65 c and optimum growth ph of 7 9 nazina et al 2004 compared with the total microbial community dna the abundance of curvibacter and env ops 17 norank was much lower in the active microbial community rna which might be associated with the distinct increment of ph in the md feed side under the di group the optimum growth ph of curvibacter and env ops 17 norank were around 6 5 7 0 and 7 8 respectively bajerski et al 2013 ding and yokota 2010 in di group the ph of feed solution obviously increased to about 8 95 360 h during the md operation partly leading to the death of curvibacter and env ops 17 norank bacteria as a whole more significant variations of microbial community composition were observed in zncl2 and fecl3 groups suggesting that the biofilm structure in the md system was more obviously affected by the metal stress compared with the stress from salts 3 5 2 analysis of salt metal stress based on pcoa the principal co ordinates analysis pcoa which calculates distances between samples based on phylogenetic relatedness of the observed otus was applied to quantify the effect of salt metal stress on microbial community changes in md membrane biofilms fig 9 c d as shown in fig 9 c significant variations of biofilm microbial community were observed for the zncl2 group during the whole md operation process 360 h at the early stage the biofilm microbial community of zncl2 group zn 4d was more similar to that of the raw water sample x0 while that remarkably shifted upon the obvious formation of zno on the membrane surface during the later period 216 360 h fig 5 c indicating the conspicuous influence of zinc stress on md biofilm structure comparatively it was surprising that there was a high similarity between the di group and nacl group partly suggesting that salt stress posed a relatively minor effect on the biofilm microbial community in the md system furthermore the distance between the total microbial community dna based samples and active microbial community rna based samples under each experimental group was also explored through pcoa analysis it was not surprising that the shortest distance between dna and rna sample was observed for the di group as only the heat stress existed in the md system when operated under the di group under the heat stress together with salt metal stress a visible distance between dna and rna samples was obtained for nacl zncl2 and fecl3 groups comparatively the nacl group exhibited a relatively shorter distance 0 06 between dna and rna based samples while the distances in fecl3 1 25 and zncl2 0 40 groups were much larger as the distance represented the differences between total microbial community and active microbial community the pcoa analysis clearly revealed that the metal stress created a more significant influence on md biofilm development compared with the salt stress 3 5 3 rda analysis based on dna data redundancy analysis rda of the md system revealed that an obvious relationship existed among biofilm microbial community structure temperature and salt metal accumulation fig 11 a rda1 and rda2 accounted for 38 82 and 17 21 of community differences in the groups respectively the first two axes accounted for a total of 56 03 of the microbial community structure changes suggesting that temperature t and salt metal accumulation indeed had a remarkable effect on biofilm microbial community structure during the md process clearly metal accumulations of zn and fe were more robust in shaping bacterial communities of md membrane biofilms at the genus level the bacterial community distribution in di and nacl groups was the most similar in comparison the bacterial community distribution in other samples was significantly different and independent the results suggested that microbial community distribution in md membrane biofilms was more distinctly affected by the environmental factors of metal stress rather than t and salt stress furthermore pelomonas and novosphingobium were the dominant functional bacteria in the zncl2 group showing positive correlations with t and metal accumulation of zn sphingobium and escherichia shigella appearing in the fecl3 group correlated positively with the metal accumulation of fe and negatively with t 3 5 4 lefse analysis based on dna data to explore the classified bacterial taxa with significant abundance differences among the four experimental groups we performed biomarker analysis using the linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse method and 60 bacterial clades present statistically significant difference with a lda threshold of 3 5 as displayed in the lefse cladogram fig 11 b the phylum proteobacteria a large group of gram negative bacteria löwer and schneider 2009 was absolutely the most significant biomarker among four groups according to the bar chart of lda score fig 11 c most bacteria were distinctly enriched in di group 19 clades while relatively fewer clades exhibited abundance advantage in nacl 12 clades and zncl2 14 clades groups and 15 clades in fecl3 group as shown in fig 11 c four biomarkers with higher lda scores in the di group were thermaceae family thermales order deinococcus thermus phylum and deinococci class and all the four biomarkers belonged to deinococcus thermus phylum considering the higher lda score of deinococcus thermus deinococcus thermus phylum can be regarded as the most important biomarker in the di group indicating that the md membrane surface in di group was mainly occupied by these thermophilic bacteria in terms of nacl group the md membrane was prevailingly enriched by members of chloroflexi phylum and olb14 class and all the enriched bacteria posed a certain tolerance to the high salinity and high temperature in md system guo and zhang 2014 trabelsi et al 2009 in the fecl3 group four biomarkers with higher lda scores were observed in md membrane biofilms including firmicutes phylum clostridiales order clostridia class sphingobium genus which were gram positive and gram negative bacteria belonging to firmicutes phylum and proteobacteria phylum these enriched bacteria in fecl3 group could well survive in the extreme environment by producing endospores and mostly belonged to the pathogenic bacteria filippidou et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 in comparison zncl2 group was mainly occupied by several biomarkers of proteobacteria phylum betaproteobacteriales order burkholderiaceae family gammaproteobacteria class alphaproteobacteria class sphingomonadales order sphingomonadaceae family and novosphingobium genus and all the enriched bacteria were gram negative belonging to proteobacteria phylum based on the above analysis lefse clearly revealed that the biomarkers were significantly different among these four experimental groups wherein only the gram negative biomarkers appeared in the zncl2 group and the fecl3 group was obviously enriched by several pathogenic bacteria these noteworthy phenomena mainly resulted from the influence of metal accumulations in the md feed side and the specific mechanisms will be discussed in detail in section 3 6 3 6 stress mechanism of salts metals on the md biofilm formation as stated above three main environmental parameters of the md system including temperature salt accumulation and metal accumulation all posed an effect on the md biofouling namely heat stress salt stress and metal stress comparatively the clear accumulation of metals in md system engendered a more significant and more complex influence on biofilm formation the specific stress mechanisms for these three environmental parameters are schematically presented in fig 12 to deeply research the stress mechanisms of temperature and salts metals accumulation the reactive oxygen species ros on the fouled md membrane was quantitatively detected using the fluorescence microscope and the corresponding results are displayed in supplementary fig s12 ros including o2 h2o2 oh etc highly reactive and cytotoxic molecules formed by the incomplete and one electron reduction of o could cause heavy oxidation to biomolecules such as lipids proteins dna etc and then destroy the cell metabolism eventually leading to the microbial death lemire et al 2013 some environmental stressors like t uv radiation ionization salts heavy metals etc were widely reported to cause the generation of endogenous ros by bacteria inducing the severe death of microorganisms das and roychoudhury 2014 flora et al 2008 suzuki et al 2012 in the di group the concentration of inorganic substances like salts and metals always maintained at a relatively low level table 2 thus the biofouling development was mainly affected by the thermal circumstance namely heat stress as shown in fig 12 a several thermolabile bacteria were dead under the heat stress and the md membrane was finally occupied by these thermophile species as confirmed by the lefse analysis fig 11 b c in comparison the production of ros 0 35 and the proportion of dead bacteria 10 2 on the md membrane surface were much lower at the end of the operation as the abrupt change in temperature occurred only in the initial stage of md operation and the microorganisms in feed side would gradually adapt to the thermal environment along with the md operation in nacl group both the heat stress and salt stress existed in the md system leading to a relatively different biofouling behavior on the md membrane fig 12 b the highly concentrated salts nacl in md feed side would cause the imbalance of electrolyte concentration between the feed solution and intracellular fluid of bacteria thus the water molecules would be largely transported from bacterial cells to feed solution and then cause the dehydration of some bacteria lefebvre et al 2012 under the continuous salt stress a clear generation of endogenous ros 3 52 was detected on the md membrane finally relatively higher amounts of dead microbes 90 9 were observed on the md membrane and the attached active bacterial community mainly consisted of halotolerant bacteria and thermophile species fig 11 b c under the metal stress of zn two different stress mechanisms were responsible for the significant death of organisms in zncl2 group namely the zn2 stress mechanism see i in fig 12 c and oxidation stress mechanism see ii in fig 12 c the zn2 stress mechanism meant that the zn2 which were gradually released by zno in solutions could be adsorbed to the negatively charged surface of the bacterium and then damage its biological activity bhadra et al 2011 specifically zno particle in solutions was positively charged as a result of the release of zn2 on its surface which would absorb the negatively charged bacteria to its surface through the coulomb attraction and then the zn2 could penetrate into the bacterial cells upon the penetration of zn2 into bacteria zn2 would largely bind with the active proteases of organisms and then inactivate them finally leading to the death of these microorganisms comparatively the gram positive bacteria with more negative charges were more likely to be absorbed to the surface of zno particles thus only the gram negative biomarkers existed on the membrane at the end of md operation fig 11 b c upon the death of bacteria zn2 would separate from the cells and then continue the above mentioned sterilization process furthermore zno particles could partly react with o2 and h2o in solutions to produce ros for the oxidation of bacterial cells which was the oxidation stress mechanism applerot et al 2009 under the two kinds of stress from zn the microorganisms in the md feed side largely died and the microbial community structure in biofilms was significantly different from that of the di group and nacl group at the end of md operation the zncl2 group demonstrated the highest ros activity with the ratio of fluorescent area up to 46 60 further confirming the remarkable anti biofouling properties of zno particles in the md system in fecl3 group a clear appearance of pathogenic microorganisms was observed on the md membrane during the initial stage see phase i in fig 12 d as the large amounts of fe3 in feed solution partly promoted the growth of these pathogenic bacteria martens et al 2010 with the extended md operation a thick deposit layer containing large amounts of fe oh 3 fe2o3 and fe3o4 gradually formed on the membrane see layer a in phase ii fig 12 d thus the amounts of free fe3 in feed side sharply decreased therefore some specific bacteria appeared in the md system which could take away fe3 from the insoluble compounds iron in the form of oxide and hydroxide by secreting siderophore braun 1997 siderophore a kind of chelating agent could specifically combine with fe3 with a stronger binding force and then formed the iron siderophore complexes in which fe3 was reduced to the more bioavailable fe2 crosa 1989 and then the iron siderophore complexes would specifically bind with the special receptor on the surface of these bacteria kaplan 2002 and then release the fe2 into cells to promote the bacterial metabolism see mechanism a in fig 12 d generally the above mentioned specific bacteria drastically competed with pathogenic microbes for fe3 through the secretion of siderophore inevitably leading to the massive death of pathogenic bacteria during the later period of md operation as confirmed by section 3 5 1 fig 10 as discussed in section 3 5 1 the md membrane was gradually occupied by large amounts of flagellated microorganisms which could rapidly move to the md membrane through their well developed flagella and then adhere tightly to the membrane surface via a holdfast phase ii in fig 12 d some species of these flagellated bacteria could secrete large amounts of extracellular mucus with the main components of polysaccharides and peptides severely promoting the biofilm formation on the md membrane layer b in fig 12 d additionally some other species emerging in fecl3 group would accumulate metabolites specific glycolipids around cells as biological surfactants thus caused the obvious decrement of hydrophobicity of ptfe membrane from the initial 128 5 contact angle of virgin ptfe membrane to around 42 9 contact angle of 15d fouled ptfe membrane in fecl3 group and then a rather severe membrane wetting phenomenon supplementary fig s2 under the above mentioned encouraging biofouling mechanism mechanism a in fig 12 d considerable amounts of active bacteria 45 40 μm3 μm2 were finally detected on the fouled membrane surface furthermore an anti biofouling mechanism mechanism b in fig 12 d also existed in the fecl3 group under the catalytic action of siderophore fe2 in bacterial cells could react with the o2 and h2o2 to form the intenser oxidant of oh cornish and page 1998 leading to a burst of ros and the corresponding bacterial death additionally the extremely low ph of feed solution might be another reason for the obvious death of microbes in fecl3 group table 1 therefore a relatively obvious generation of endogenous ros 8 72 was finally detected on the md membrane generally heat stress salt stress and metal stress all posed certain effects on biofouling development in the md system and a more remarkable influence was observed for metal stress considering the super hydrophobicity and outstanding anti biofouling property of zno membrane modification might be a feasible method for the mitigation of biofouling in the md system in which a layer of zno nanoparticles was applied on the surface of ptfe materials in view of the encouraging biofouling property of iron and the high risk of membrane wetting it is necessary to strictly control the iron concentration in md system during the pretreatment process of feed solutions 4 conclusions in this study the influence of salt and metal accumulation on md biofouling and the corresponding system performance was comprehensively researched especially emphasizing the microbial community succession under the salt metal stress the results led to the following conclusions 1 the membrane flux decline trends of four experiments exhibited obvious differences and the most severe flux decline was obtained for the fecl3 group which might be highly attributed to the conspicuous deposition of fe oh 3 on the membrane comparatively the membrane fouling trend of md was obviously retarded for nacl and zncl2 group which might be highly attributed to the clear death of bacteria under the salt stress and metal stress from zn 2 in fecl3 group a thick fouling layer containing large amounts of inorganics organics and organisms finally formed on the md membrane promoting the significant membrane fouling in the md system a serious scaling layer was observed for the nacl group which induced a sharp flux decline during the later stage of md operation comparatively the zncl2 group exhibited a thin fouling layer containing rather fewer organics inorganics and microorganisms ensuring the continuously stable and high permeate flux of ptfe membrane during the long term md operation 3 compared with the thermal stress and salt stress the environmental factor of metal stress posed a more remarkable impact on the biofilm structure in the md system considering the super hydrophobicity and outstanding anti biofouling property of zno the surface modification of ptfe membrane with a layer of zno nanoparticles might be a feasible method for the mitigation of biofouling in the md system furthermore it is necessary to strictly control the iron concentration in the md system during the pretreatment process in view of the encouraging biofouling property of iron the high propensity to gather pathogenic bacteria in the md system as well as the high risk of membrane wetting

17959,membrane distillation md works as a potential technology for the zero liquid discharge water treatment owing to its high concentration brine tolerance the continuous accumulation of salts and metals in the md system during the zero liquid discharge water treatment inevitably posed remarkable impacts on the biofilm formation as well as the md performance hence the biofouling mechanism of md was deeply researched in this study with an emphasis on the roles of salt stress nacl and metal stress zn and fe in biofilm development the membrane flux decline of md was effectively mitigated by the appearance of nacl and zno while that was significantly aggravated under the metal stress of fe considering the serious membrane scaling caused by nacl crystals a sharp flux decline was seen for the nacl group during the later stage of md operation basing on the 16s rdna and 16s rrna analysis heat stress salt stress and metal stress all posed certain impacts on the biofouling development in the md system and a more remarkable influence was observed for metal stress under the salt stress from nacl a thin biofilm containing high biovolume of dead cells finally formed in which the bacterial community mainly consisted of halotolerant and thermophile species owing to the zn2 stress and oxidation stress mechanisms of zno the bacteria in the md system were largely dead and live bacterial community in biofilms was dominated by some gram negative species under the metal stress from fe a rather thick biofilm containing higher biovolume of live cells clearly developed in which the prevailing species could secret large amounts of eps and accumulate metabolites around cells as biological surfactants inducing aggravated membrane biofouling and high risk of membrane wetting graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane distillation salt stress metal stress microbial community succession biofouling biofilm formation 1 introduction membrane distillation md a new type water purification technology integrating membrane separation and distillation process in a single system possesses a prominent superiority in water treatment due to its better water purifying ability and less stringent membrane mechanical properties qtaishat and banat 2013 however energy consumption and membrane fouling are two main obstacles to the large scale industrial application of md technology among which the energy consumption issue can be effectively solved through the usage of several cheap energy e g solar energy geothermal energy waste heat etc khayet 2013 sarbatly and chiam 2013 like all other membrane processes membrane fouling issue as a major inefficiency of md causes a significant flux decline and severe deterioration of effluent quality and membrane performance seidel and elimelech 2002 besides the high profile issue of organic fouling and scaling liu et al 2018 qin et al 2018 zou et al 2018 membrane biofouling is also a nonnegligible problem for the md performance chen et al 2015 liu et al 2019 while the knowledge about biofilm formation in the md system is still limited it is known to all that the md is a process of high temperature and high salinity in which the foulants in feed side are largely concentrated during the md operation the highly concentrated salts and metals as well as the extremely thermal condition of the md feed side would significantly affect the microbial community structure inevitably resulting in a distinct biofilm formation compared to other traditional membrane separation technologies gryta 2002 found that the growth of microorganisms and biofouling formation in the md system was limited by the extreme operating conditions of md including the high feed temperature and high concentration of salt in the feed side hence the md biofouling may exhibit a different nature compared to that in uf mf and ro even so membrane biofouling was still a problem for the md operation since that some bacterial species could unexpectedly survive and grow at the extreme surroundings tijing et al 2015 zodrow et al 2014 gryta 2002 further evaluated the growth of different microorganisms on the md membrane and found that different microorganisms reacted differently to the fouling of md membrane additionally a previous research krivorot et al 2011 has systematically considered the possible influencing factors for biofouling development in the md system including hydrodynamics feed temperature and feed water quality of md however only the variations of flux decline and biofilm biomass under different operating conditions were surveyed in this research neglecting the changes of bacterial community structure in biofilms to deeply investigate the md biofouling zodrow et al 2014 linked the microbial community structure to biofouling of md and discovered that the seasonal succession of the bacterial community in seawater posed a distinct impact on the biofilm structure during the md treatment of seawater in our previous studies we have detailedly researched the effects of feed temperature feed water quality and feed concentration on the biofilm community structure and biofouling development in the md system at present the md system was acknowledged as a competitive technology for the near zero liquid discharge water treatment due to its high salinity tolerance and the efficiency under low grade heat tong and elimelech 2016 tufa et al 2015 in the near zero liquid discharge water treatment a continuous concentration phenomenon was observed at the feed side over the md running process inevitably resulting in a distinct impact on biofilm development in real production process the md technology would be widely applied into the near zero liquid discharge treatment of seawater industrial wastewater surface water underground water and so on wherein the salts and metals were significantly concentrated in md feed side and then caused an ineluctable influence on the biofilm formation in md system presently many studies have paid wide attention into the effects of salinity and heavy metals on biofouling development in the conventional membrane separation processes like mbr ro uf etc amiri et al 2010 huang et al 2016 jang et al 2013 wang et al 2018 it has been found that the high salinity ca and na in the mbr system could obviously change the microbial community structure in biofilms finally causing the variations of cake layer resistance on the membrane jang et al 2013 kim and jang 2006 furthermore several researchers aftab et al 2017 amiri et al 2010 armendáriz ontiveros et al 2019 investigated the impacts of heavy metals cr pb ni mn and fe on membrane biofouling and the results revealed that the existence of heavy metals in membrane separation process could effectively inhibit the bioactivity of bacteria and then reduce the biofilm layer thickness finally mitigating the membrane biofouling differently wang et al 2018 researched the effects of al and fe iii on uf membrane biofouling and found that the appearance of fe iii induced a higher secretion of eps and then promoted the biofilm formation obviously aggravating the membrane biofouling of uf it can be seen from the above mentioned previous researches that the presence of salinity and heavy metals in feed solutions indeed played crucial roles in biofouling development during the membrane separation process additionally we previously researched the md biofouling mechanism under two typical operating modes open loop mode and closed loop mode and found that the accumulation of inorganic substances in the md system clearly changed the microbial community structure in biofilms under closed loop mode liu et al 2020 while the specific influencing mechanisms of salinity and heavy metals were not deeply investigated in our previous study to our best knowledge current researches regarding md biofouling were mainly focused on the effects of feed temperature water quality and hydrodynamics while the role of salts and metals accumulation in md biofouling and the corresponding system performance has not been systematically investigated until now hence the objective of this study was to investigate the membrane biofouling mechanisms of md system considering the influence of salts and metals accumulation in the feed side during the near zero liquid discharge treatment of surface water contaminated by salts and heavy metals in the real production process the treated mining wastewaters were directly discharged to surface water in which the abundant heavy metals e g pb cr hg as fe zn etc partly polluted the surface water therefore the xuanwu lake water was chosen as initial feed solutions for the md operation in this study and the high concentration of nacl zncl2 and fecl3 solutions were selected as the supplement for feed solution during the long term md operation respectively in this way the role of salt and metal accumulation in md biofouling formation could be clearly clarified which may assist in the further development of anti biofouling materials and treatments 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment setup the schematic of a lab scale direct contact membrane distillation dcmd system is presented in fig 1 a type of commercial hydrophobic membrane of polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe was chosen for md operation in this study and its basic characteristics are listed in supplementary table s1 according to our previous research liu et al 2019 the temperatures of md feed and permeate sides were set as 60 c and 10 c respectively and the cross flow velocities of feed and permeate solutions both maintained at 10 5 mm s in this study the normalized flux nf was applied to monitor the fouling process of md which was calculated as follows 1 nf j j 0 where nf j and j 0 are the normalized flux permeate flux and initial flux respectively the permeate solution was collected and weighted by an electronic balance bs 3000 yousheng balance company china and the permeate flux data was logged into a computer every 10 min 2 2 feed solution preparation this study was aimed at the near zero liquid discharge treatment of surface water contaminated by salts and heavy metals using md technology to simulate the feed solution for md operation the xuanwu lake nanjing china supplementary fig s1 water in summer was chosen as the initial feed solution 15 l in this study to accelerate the accumulation of salts and metals in the feed side and then accurately research its impacts on md biofouling the high concentration of nacl zncl2 and fecl3 solutions 0 8 mol l for each metal were selected as the supplement for feed solution during the long term md operation three experimental groups in terms of the blank control group the di water was chosen as the supplement for feed solution during the whole md operation 2 3 analytical methods the variations of ph conductivity and toc in both feed and permeate sides were daily measured through a ph meter denver instrument america a conductivity meter dds 11a china and a toc analyzer toc vcsh shimadzu japan respectively the concentrations of metals ca na zn fe in feed solutions were measured using icp aes perkinelmer plasma 3200rl to study the variations of organics in feed solutions the uv254 and eem of feed solutions filtration through 0 45 mm were analyzed by a uv spectrophotometer uv 3000 shanghai mapada instruments co ltd and a hitachi f 7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi inc japan at the end of md operation 600 ml feed solutions extraction using 15 ml hexane 15 ml dichloromethane and 15 ml chloroform were sampled for gc ms measurement via a gas chromatography gc7890a agilent to research the changes of organic compositions in feed solutions the morphology and elemental composition of the membrane surface and cross section were investigated by a sem s 4800 hitachi coupled with eds octane plus ametek the functional group analysis of the fouled membrane surface was performed using a ftir tensor 27 bruker spectrometer with a scanning range of 500 4000 cm 1 the mineral compositions of membrane depositions were determined via a xrd instrument d8 quest bruker to research the composition of fluorescent substances in fouling layers the membrane depositions were extracted from the fouled membrane surface using di water for eem analysis at the end of md operation the fouled membrane coupons were removed from md system and immediately stained with a solution of syto 9 and propidium iodide pi according to the manual live dead baclight invitrogen to identify the ratio of live dead cells in biofilms via a confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm leica tcs sp8 inc the intracellular ros was detected by the dcfh da ros probe reactive oxygen species assay kit solarbio and then analyzed using a fluorescence microscope nikon eclipse 80i japan the area of fluorescent region was measured using image pro plus the specific description of each analytical method is presented in detail in the supplementary information section iii 2 4 high throughput sequencing and microbial community analysis at the end of each md operation the fouled membrane samples were collected from the md system and then frozen at 80 c until the dna or rna extraction methods of dna or rna extraction data processing and statistical analysis were described in detail in the supplementary information section iv all the microbiological data were accurately submitted to the sra database with a project number of srp239375 3 results and discussions 3 1 md performance 3 1 1 water quality analysis as shown in table 1 the conductivity of di group continuously maintained in a range of 0 23 0 24 ms cm during the whole md operation 360 h differently the conductivity of nacl zncl2 and fecl3 group significantly raised to the final values of 69 40 68 90 and 87 90 ms cm respectively suggesting that obvious accumulations of salts and metals indeed occurred in md feed side for nacl zncl2 and fecl3 groups additionally distinct variations of ph can also be obtained for feed solutions which finally increased to 8 95 and 7 50 for di and nacl groups respectively however the ph of feed solutions in zncl2 6 17 360 h and fecl3 0 90 360 h group clearly decreased to an acid range likely attributing to the considerable appearance of h in feed solutions caused by the hydrolyzation of zncl2 and fecl3 furthermore the toc of di and fecl3 groups obviously increased to 45 94 mg l and 46 86 mg l 360 h which might be associated with the metabolite secreted by bacteria in terms of nacl and zncl2 group a slight reduction of toc can be seen for feed solutions during the md operation table 1 highly attributing to the inhibited metabolism of microorganisms caused by the salt stress of nacl and metal stress of zn comparatively rather fewer changes of water qualities can be obtained in the permeate side except for the fecl3 group supplementary fig s2 in di nacl and zncl2 group the ph 6 61 7 02 and conductivity 1 49 20 90 μs cm of permeate solutions continuously maintained in a stable range demonstrating that the ptfe membrane could consistently play a good separation role during the whole water treatment process differently the ph and conductivity of permeate solutions in fecl3 group obviously varied to the final values of 2 91 and 790 00 μs cm suggesting that a certain membrane wetting phenomenon occurred in the md system 3 1 2 permeate flux decline as shown in fig 2 the membrane flux decline of md was effectively mitigated by the accumulation of nacl and zncl2 in feed solutions likely due to the inhibited growth of bacteria in the feed side with the continuous deposition of nacl crystals a clear scaling layer gradually formed on the md membrane leading to a sharp flux decline during the later period of md operation 216 360 h comparatively a rather significant flux decline was seen for the fecl3 group which rapidly reduced to around 0 65 at the early period 0 90 h and then maintained at a relatively low level of 0 53 0 65 90 360 h the appearance of iron ions in feed solutions could partly promote the metabolism of microbes wang et al 2018 wu et al 2012 and then aggravate the md biofouling largely accelerating the flux decline of md membrane considering the rather higher concentration of toc 46 86 mg l table 1 in the feed side significant organic fouling induced by microbial metabolites indeed occurred in the fecl3 group further contributing to the serious flux decline of md furthermore the conspicuous deposition of fe oh 3 flocculent precipitates on the membrane might be another reason for the remarkable deterioration of membrane flux which was generated from the hydrolyzation of fecl3 3 2 variations of inorganic and organic contents in feed solutions as shown in table 2 the concentrations of na zn2 and fe3 in nacl zncl2 and fecl3 group significantly increased to the final values of 22 50 g l na 29 74 g l zn2 and 36 28 g l fe3 respectively further confirming the remarkable accumulations of salinity and heavy metals in md feed side differently ca2 as the representative inorganic ion in the di group exhibited a slight decrement of concentration from 25 40 mg l 0 d to 17 70 mg l 15 d possibly due to the mild deposition of ca salts on the membrane the eem analysis was applied to explore the composition of fluorescent substances in feed solutions which revealed that the initial xuanwu lake water consisted of six kinds of fluorescent matters in region i vi supplementary fig s3 as shown in fig 3 the eem spectra of feed solutions demonstrated obvious variations with the md operation in di and nacl group the fluorescent matters in feed solutions mainly composed of tyrosine tyrosine like protein tryptophan and tryptophan like protein in region i iv besides the obvious fluorescent signal in region i iv the eem spectra of zncl2 group also exhibited clear fluorescent peaks in region v vi peak f and g the remarkable increment of fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances region v vi in zncl2 group might be highly associated with the biological processes in feed solutions in the md feed side the zncl2 compounds were largely hydrolyzed to the unstable zn oh 2 which eventually decomposed into the zno substances zno compound was widely reported to pose a certain sterilization property which could cause the apparent death of microorganisms oprea et al 2014 riaz et al 2015 hence humic substances including fulvic acid like and humic acid like compounds as the products of cell autolysis after microbial death were largely released to feed solutions in zncl2 group swaby and ladd 1966 similar results can also be obtained from the uv254 analysis supplementary fig s4 furthermore the gc ms analysis was performed to further research the changes of organic composition in feed solutions and the results are presented in supplementary fig s5 and tables s2 s8 in nacl and zncl2 group the types of organic matters in feed solutions clearly raised with the md operation which might be associated with the release of organics from dead cells under the stress of nacl and zno in comparison with the nacl 173 types and zncl2 155 types groups the fecl3 group exhibited rather fewer types of organics 75 types in feed solutions possibly attributing to the active microbiological degradation of organic substances induced by the iron element in feed side wang et al 2018 wu et al 2012 additionally the membrane wetting phenomenon in fecl3 group might be another reason for the reduced organic types in feed solutions as shown in supplementary fig s6 and tables s6 s7 the types of organic matters in permeate solutions distinctly increased from 122 1 d to 187 15 d during the md operation suggesting the occurrence of membrane wetting in fecl3 group similar results can also be obtained from the eem spectra of permeate solutions supplementary figure s2 c besides the common fluorescent matters in region i iv the humic acid like substances can also be clearly detected in the permeate side of fecl3 group further confirming the occurrence of membrane wetting in the md system in fecl3 group the feed solutions exhibited distinct corrosiveness and acidity ph of 0 90 1 28 table 1 owing to the hydrolyzation of fecl3 compounds which posed impacts on the properties of hydrophobic ptfe membrane and then destroyed the stable performance of md system 3 3 membrane fouling analysis 3 3 1 ftir analysis as displayed in fig 4 and supplementary table s9 the virgin ptfe membrane exhibited two characteristic peaks for the stretching vibration of cf2 group 1223 and 1154 cm 1 wang et al 2015 besides the two peaks of virgin ptfe membrane the fouled membranes in di group also showed other characteristic peaks at 1642 1538 1012 1000 and 916 cm 1 suggesting the existence of amide i amide ii silicate and polysaccharide on the membrane liu et al 2020 in nacl group the ftir spectra of fouled membranes demonstrated other peaks at 3293 2962 2927 2850 1734 1203 1148 695 656 and 1460 1320 cm 1 indicating the clear depositions of humic acids fulvic acids nacl and na2co3 on the membrane jönsson et al 2007 liu et al 2020 şansal and somer 1999 besides the characteristic peaks of organics the ftir spectra of fouled membranes in zncl2 group also exhibited obvious peaks of zn salts including zn oh 2 3424 3227 cm 1 zno 1444 611 600 575 and 545 cm 1 zn5cl2 oh 8 h2o 1620 900 and 730 cm 1 znco3 1510 1382 and 835 cm 1 etc ghotbi 2010 singh and gopal 2008 similarly fouled membranes obtained in fecl3 group showed distinct characteristic peaks of fe salts besides the peaks of organics such as fe oh 3 fe oh 2 fe2o3 fecl3 and fe3o4 su and suarez 1995 zhang et al 2013 basing on the ftir results it can be seen that the md membranes of nacl zncl2 and fecl3 groups were severely fouled by the mineral salts besides the organic depositions which inevitably posed nonnegligible effects on the microbial community structure in biofilms 3 3 2 xrd analysis the xrd analysis was conducted to further study the salt crystals deposited on the md membrane and the results are listed in supplementary fig s7 the virgin pttfe membrane exhibited three strong crystalline peaks at around 18 2 22 9 and 25 9 corresponding to the material of ptfe membrane as a semicrystalline polymer watanabe and akashi 2009 besides the peaks of ptfe material a weak peak at 29 8 can also be seen from the xrd spectra of fouled membranes in di group suggesting the mild deposition of calcite on the membrane tang et al 2008 hence it can be inferred that the slight attachment of calcite on the membrane might be another reason for the flux decline of di group besides the two main fouling factors of organics and microorganisms in nacl group two peaks at 31 6 and 45 5 were observed in the xrd pattern indicating the obvious appearance of nacl crystals on the membrane bai et al 2002 jiang and fan 2003 the fouled membranes obtained in zncl2 group were clearly deposited by zn salts of zno 28 9 and 31 8 and zn oh 2 20 1 20 5 24 9 26 9 32 9 40 9 and 43 0 zhang and li 2003 in fecl3 group several weak peaks at 21 2 33 2 36 6 53 2 55 8 59 0 61 3 and 64 0 can be seen from the xrd spectra of fouled membranes suggesting the existence of fe2o3 and fe3o4 on the membrane zhang et al 2013 the xrd results further confirmed that distinct depositions of mineral salts indeed occurred on the md membrane in nacl zncl2 and fecl3 groups inevitably influencing the biofilm formation in the md system 3 3 3 sem eds analysis 3 3 3 1 membrane surface analysis the virgin ptfe membrane exhibited a fibrous microporous structure supplementary figure s8 a which was gradually covered by a fouling layer with the md operation fig 5 in di group a dense cake layer containing large amounts of organics c and o 66 91 76 41 cps kev finally formed on the md membrane which might be associated with the high concentration of organics table 1 and serious biofouling in md feed side comparatively the depositions of organics on the membrane obviously reduced in nacl c and o 39 90 50 17 cps kev and zncl2 group c and o 32 09 44 78 cps kev likely due to the mitigated membrane biofouling under the salt stress of nacl and metal stress of zno in nacl group the clear appearance of nacl crystals na 12 93 cps kev see red arrow in fig 5 b1 on the membrane can be obtained at 96 h with the further md operation the membrane surface was gradually covered by a crystal layer na 20 73 cps kev leading to the sharp flux decline during the later stage fig 2 comparatively the zno crystals were later found on the md membrane in zncl2 group see red arrow in fig 5 c2 which clearly increased zn 26 68 cps kev at the later period 216 360 h differently the md membranes of fecl3 group were severely covered by a dense fe oh 3 colloidal layer and nearly no obvious crystals can be observed from the membrane surface morphology fig 5 d generally a rather milder fouling layer finally formed on the membrane surface of zncl2 group in which the fibrous microporous structure of virgin ptfe can still be seen from the 360 h operated membranes see red cycles in fig 5 c3 3 3 3 2 cross section line analysis the eds cross section line analysis of fouled membranes was performed as previously reported liu et al 2018 considering the thickness of each fouled membrane was less than 300 μm the beginning and ending points of eds cross section line analysis were set at points a and d supplementary fig s8 respectively fig 6 depicts the cross section morphologies of fouled membranes which revealed that the membranes operated in nacl and zncl2 group both exhibited a thinner fouling layer than that of di and fecl3 group in fecl3 group an extremely thicker and denser fouling layer clearly formed on the membrane consequently leading to a rather severe flux decline behavior as shown in fig 7 rather larger amounts of organics can be detected from the membrane surface as well as the pores of fecl3 group comparatively the fouled membranes of zncl2 group displayed extremely fewer depositions of organic matters on the md membrane surface or pores suggesting that a milder organic fouling behavior occurred in zncl2 group except for the fecl3 group the inorganic substances mainly deposited on the membrane surface in fecl3 group rather distinct amounts of inorganics fe can be detected from the membrane surface as well as the pores the obvious penetration of hydrophilic iron precipitates into the pores might be responsible for the membrane wetting in fecl3 group in other experimental groups the inorganic matters mainly appeared on the md surfaces which were extremely less found in membrane pores fig 7 b1 b3 compared to the zncl2 group a thicker inorganic layer obviously formed on the md membrane in nacl group revealing that a serious membrane scaling occurred in nacl group generally the md membranes in zncl2 group exhibited a quite mild fouling behavior where a thinner fouling layer containing fewer amounts of inorganic and organic foulants finally formed on the membrane 3 3 4 3d eem analysis of membrane foulants to research the compositions of fluorescent matters in membrane fouling layers the deposited foulants were extracted from the md membrane surface for eem analysis as exhibited in supplementary fig s9 the foulants deposited on the membrane prevailingly consisted of tyrosine tyrosine like protein tryptophan in region i iii which was highly associated with the interfacial interactions between different fluorescent substances and md membrane surface differently a rather obvious existence of humic acid like compounds region v was detected on the ptfe membrane surface in zncl2 group this phenomenon might be due to that the bacteria in feed side distinctly died under the metal stress of zno thus the humic acid like substances were largely released outside the dead cells and then accumulated on the md membrane oprea et al 2014 riaz et al 2015 swaby and ladd 1966 3 4 biofilm structure on the membrane surface the morphologies of biofilms developed in different experimental groups as well as the ratio of live and dead bacteria in biofilms are presented in fig 8 it can be clearly observed that a rather higher biovolume of biofilm was obtained for fecl3 group 60 85 μm3 μm2 in which the live bacteria 45 40 μm3 μm2 occupied a remarkable proportion 74 6 it might be highly due to that the iron element in feed solutions worked as an essential nutrient for the growth of microorganisms which would partly promote the microbial growth in the md feed side wang et al 2018 wu et al 2012 however compared to the di group relatively higher biovolume of dead bacteria 15 45 μm3 μm2 was also seen in biofilms of fecl3 group likely attributing to the highly hydrolysis of fe3 upon the hydrolysis of fe3 the md feed solution became relatively acidic and corrosive ph of 0 90 1 28 table 1 causing the death of some microorganisms in the feed side comparatively rather large amounts of dead cells were detected in biofilms of nacl and zncl2 group which were around 20 55 μm3 μm2 nacl and 42 80 μm3 μm2 zncl2 after 360 h of md operation under the salt metal stress from nacl crystals and zno microorganisms in the md feed side largely died leading to the higher biovolume of dead cells in membrane biofilms compared to nacl group 22 61 μm3 μm2 higher amounts of biomass were detected on the fouled membranes of zncl2 group 47 75 μm3 μm2 attributing to the later appearance of zno on the md membrane fig 5 c during the early stage of md operation relatively less zno formed on the membrane thus bacteria in feed solutions preferential attached to the ptfe membrane with the extension of md operation increasing amounts of zno deposited on the membrane significantly inducing the death of bacteria oprea et al 2014 riaz et al 2015 therefore a thicker biofilm containing extremely high amounts of dead cells finally developed on the md membrane in zncl2 group 3 5 microbial community analysis of md membrane biofilms 3 5 1 analysis of the total dna and active rna microbial community to explore the influence of salt metal stress on the biofilm formation of md and the corresponding microbial community structure the high throughput sequencings of 16s rdna and 16s rrna were conducted to analyze the total bacteria and live bacteria in md membrane biofilms respectively given the high coverage index 0 996 of each biological sample it can be proven that the sequencing depth in this study was high enough to truly reflect the bacterial community supplementary fig s10 for the nacl group the variations of otu in biofilms were relatively similar to that of the di group fig 9 a differently the membrane biofilms obtained in zncl2 360 h 586 and fecl3 groups 360 h 592 both demonstrated abundant otu compared to di and nacl groups indicating the remarkable effects of metal stress on the md biofilm structure fig 9 b the specific microbial community structure of total dna and active rna bacteria at phylum class and genus level are shown in fig 10 and supplementary fig s11 in which significant distinctions were clearly observed between raw water and md membrane biofilm samples for the raw water group x0 cyanobium pcc 6307 20 14 and 46 27 in dna and rna based samples and hgci clade 22 03 and 8 06 in dna and rna based samples were the predominant genera which could not be found in md membrane biofilm samples comparatively some other microbes such as tepidimonas enriched in both di and nacl group meiothermus enriched in both di and nacl group sphingobium enriched in both zncl2 and fecl3 group env ops 17 norank enriched in di group curvibacter enriched in di group olb14 norank enriched in nacl group pelomonas enriched in zncl2 group novosphingobium enriched in zncl2 group sphingomonas enriched in zncl2 group and bradyrhizobium enriched in fecl3 group were found abundant in md membrane biofilms tepidimonas and meiothermus were two representative genera in md membrane biofilms developed under di and nacl groups in the raw water nearly no tepidimonas and meiothermus can be detected in both dna and rna based samples while these two genera clearly existed on the md membrane and especially the abundances of tepidimonas and meiothermus in di 5 15 19 36 and 21 52 48 44 respectively and nacl group 2 53 17 61 and 12 60 27 30 respectively were significantly higher than that of zncl2 0 01 0 50 and 0 53 4 65 respectively and fecl3 group 0 02 0 46 and 0 07 1 18 respectively additionally the above mentioned genera of tepidimonas and meiothermus still demonstrated rather obvious proportions in rna based samples after 360 h of md operation under di and nacl group these two genera of tepidimonas and meiothermus as thermophilic and biofilm developing bacteria were widely found in hot spring with optimum growth temperatures of around 55 60 c tepidimonas and 40 70 c meiothermus respectively chen et al 2002 2006 considering the high operating temperature of md process 60 c these thermophilic bacteria which prefer thermal circumstances were predicted to be enriched in the md system however compared with the di group the abundance of active tepidimonas and meiothermus were relatively lower in the nacl group suggesting that the metabolism process of tepidimonas and meiothermus in md system was partly limited by the salt stress of highly concentrated nacl solution recent researches also found that nacl solution with a concentration higher than 1 would not be beneficial for the growth of thermophilic bacteria like tepidimonas and meiothermus albuquerque et al 2009 habib et al 2018 significantly different from the di and nacl group the genera of tepidimonas and meiothermus almost disappeared from md system under the zncl2 and fecl3 groups evidently indicating that zn2 and fe3 indeed posed a remarkable metal stress on the growth of tepidimonas and meiothermus in md system and directly determined the subsistence of these thermophilic genera zhu et al 2010 sphingobium sphingomonas and novosphingobium defining as gram negative alphaproteobacteria were other organisms that merit attention as they were found in abundance only in zncl2 group and fecl3 group 6 22 39 02 and 22 04 26 34 for zncl2 and fecl3 group respectively comparatively the above mentioned three genera were nearly undetected in the di group 1 41 and nacl group 0 15 indicating that these special bacteria posed a tendency to live in metal rich environments owning to the diverse environmental adaptations and biodegradative capabilities the sphingobium sphingomonas and novosphingobium genera have been widely applied into the degradation of contaminants like pahs as well as the soil remediation especially the heavy metal contaminated industrial soils thus it can be seen that these bacteria indeed posed a certain tolerance to heavy metals like zn and fe chen et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 however compared with the total microbial community dna the abundance of sphingobium was much lower in the active microbial community rna suggesting that sphingobium was a predominant genus only in the early stage of md process and it could not survive in zncl2 and fecl3 groups for a long time the gradually formed zno and fe3o4 in the md system would pass through the cytomembrane of sphingobium and then cause the dna damage sun et al 2017 leading to the significant disappearance of active sphingobium in zncl2 and fecl3 groups during the later stage of md operation pelomonas a gram negative betaproteobacteria enriched in both dna and rna based samples from the zncl2 group was observed to be an absolutely predominant genus 36 48 37 95 in md membrane biofilms that formed under zncl2 group as reported by miao et al 2019 pelomonas was an oxidative stress tolerant genus owning an ability to resist the great oxidative stress from zno substances furthermore another genus of anoxybacillus can also be largely found in the zncl2 group with an abundant proportion of around 13 40 in rna based samples anoxybacillus a gram positive bacterium was able to produce spores with special resistance to various adverse environments which could well adapt to the extreme changes of temperature ph and salinity khairuddin et al 2016 the optimum growth temperature of anoxybacillus was around 54 c and it can well survive even at a high temperature of 64 c khairuddin et al 2016 comparatively the abundance of anoxybacillus in rna based samples 13 40 was obviously lower than that of pelomonas 37 95 which might be highly attributed to the gram positive characteristic of anoxybacillus in a near neutral or alkalescent environment the gram positive organisms were more negatively charged than the gram negative bacteria owning to the dissolution of free zn2 from zno the positively charged zno particle would easily adsorb the more negatively charged gram positive anoxybacillus bacteria to its surface and then killed them liu et al 2011 under the fecl3 group large amounts of pathogenic bacteria were detected in md membrane biofilms including escherichia shigella 5 09 11 83 faecalibacterium 1 18 6 84 and bacteroides 1 53 7 20 suggesting that iron element might be able to promote the metabolism of pathogenic microorganisms in md system additionally other organisms containing bradyrhizobium 7 69 caulobacter 11 54 herbaspirillum 11 54 and microbacteriaceae unclassified 34 62 were all found abundant in rna based samples fig 10 d and these bacteria could easily move to md membrane surface through their well developed flagella bradyrhizobium a gram negative genus was widely reported to pose the ability of sufficiently absorbing iron element in the environment through the secretion of siderophore as well as the genetic expression of ferric siderophore receptor gene abd alla 1998 guerinot et al 1990 lesueur et al 1993 small et al 2009 as reported by corzo et al 1994 the bradyrhizobium genus was able to secrete abundant extracellular mucus with the main components of polysaccharides and peptides which would consequentially aggravate the membrane fouling of md system besides caulobacter a gram negative genus could adhere tightly to the ptfe membrane surface via its holdfast further exacerbating the membrane fouling phenomenon in the md system li et al 2013 microbacteriaceae unclassified a absolutely dominant bacterium in fecl3 group was widely found to pose the ability of resisting salts heat heavy metals and extreme ph conditions cavalca et al 2010 kim et al 2011 zhang et al 2010 thus abundant microbacteriaceae unclassified bacteria were detected in md system some species belonging to microbacteriaceae unclassified genus could secrete large amounts of exopolysaccharides epss godinho and bhosle 2009 significantly promoting the md membrane fouling under fecl3 group moreover some microbacteriaceae unclassified bacteria accumulated metabolites specific glycolipids around cells as biological surfactants palme et al 2010 upon the attachment of these organisms onto the md membrane the biological surfactants around cells would seriously reduce the surface tension of hydrophobic ptfe membrane thus promoted the occurrence of membrane wetting phenomenon in the md system besides the tepidimonas and meiothermus some other active microbes like olb14 norank 11 22 chelatococcus 16 55 bacillaceae uncultured 10 38 and anoxybacillus 6 17 were also obviously found in nacl group which were reported to pose the ability of living in the extreme circumstances of high temperature and high salinity panday and das 2010 yang and zhou 2014 in terms of di group abundant genera of curvibacter geobacillus and env ops 17 norank also existed in md membrane biofilms besides the tepidimonas and meiothermus geobacillus was reported to be a thermophilic and biofilm forming bacterium which was widely found in hot spring with the optimum growth temperature of 60 65 c and optimum growth ph of 7 9 nazina et al 2004 compared with the total microbial community dna the abundance of curvibacter and env ops 17 norank was much lower in the active microbial community rna which might be associated with the distinct increment of ph in the md feed side under the di group the optimum growth ph of curvibacter and env ops 17 norank were around 6 5 7 0 and 7 8 respectively bajerski et al 2013 ding and yokota 2010 in di group the ph of feed solution obviously increased to about 8 95 360 h during the md operation partly leading to the death of curvibacter and env ops 17 norank bacteria as a whole more significant variations of microbial community composition were observed in zncl2 and fecl3 groups suggesting that the biofilm structure in the md system was more obviously affected by the metal stress compared with the stress from salts 3 5 2 analysis of salt metal stress based on pcoa the principal co ordinates analysis pcoa which calculates distances between samples based on phylogenetic relatedness of the observed otus was applied to quantify the effect of salt metal stress on microbial community changes in md membrane biofilms fig 9 c d as shown in fig 9 c significant variations of biofilm microbial community were observed for the zncl2 group during the whole md operation process 360 h at the early stage the biofilm microbial community of zncl2 group zn 4d was more similar to that of the raw water sample x0 while that remarkably shifted upon the obvious formation of zno on the membrane surface during the later period 216 360 h fig 5 c indicating the conspicuous influence of zinc stress on md biofilm structure comparatively it was surprising that there was a high similarity between the di group and nacl group partly suggesting that salt stress posed a relatively minor effect on the biofilm microbial community in the md system furthermore the distance between the total microbial community dna based samples and active microbial community rna based samples under each experimental group was also explored through pcoa analysis it was not surprising that the shortest distance between dna and rna sample was observed for the di group as only the heat stress existed in the md system when operated under the di group under the heat stress together with salt metal stress a visible distance between dna and rna samples was obtained for nacl zncl2 and fecl3 groups comparatively the nacl group exhibited a relatively shorter distance 0 06 between dna and rna based samples while the distances in fecl3 1 25 and zncl2 0 40 groups were much larger as the distance represented the differences between total microbial community and active microbial community the pcoa analysis clearly revealed that the metal stress created a more significant influence on md biofilm development compared with the salt stress 3 5 3 rda analysis based on dna data redundancy analysis rda of the md system revealed that an obvious relationship existed among biofilm microbial community structure temperature and salt metal accumulation fig 11 a rda1 and rda2 accounted for 38 82 and 17 21 of community differences in the groups respectively the first two axes accounted for a total of 56 03 of the microbial community structure changes suggesting that temperature t and salt metal accumulation indeed had a remarkable effect on biofilm microbial community structure during the md process clearly metal accumulations of zn and fe were more robust in shaping bacterial communities of md membrane biofilms at the genus level the bacterial community distribution in di and nacl groups was the most similar in comparison the bacterial community distribution in other samples was significantly different and independent the results suggested that microbial community distribution in md membrane biofilms was more distinctly affected by the environmental factors of metal stress rather than t and salt stress furthermore pelomonas and novosphingobium were the dominant functional bacteria in the zncl2 group showing positive correlations with t and metal accumulation of zn sphingobium and escherichia shigella appearing in the fecl3 group correlated positively with the metal accumulation of fe and negatively with t 3 5 4 lefse analysis based on dna data to explore the classified bacterial taxa with significant abundance differences among the four experimental groups we performed biomarker analysis using the linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse method and 60 bacterial clades present statistically significant difference with a lda threshold of 3 5 as displayed in the lefse cladogram fig 11 b the phylum proteobacteria a large group of gram negative bacteria löwer and schneider 2009 was absolutely the most significant biomarker among four groups according to the bar chart of lda score fig 11 c most bacteria were distinctly enriched in di group 19 clades while relatively fewer clades exhibited abundance advantage in nacl 12 clades and zncl2 14 clades groups and 15 clades in fecl3 group as shown in fig 11 c four biomarkers with higher lda scores in the di group were thermaceae family thermales order deinococcus thermus phylum and deinococci class and all the four biomarkers belonged to deinococcus thermus phylum considering the higher lda score of deinococcus thermus deinococcus thermus phylum can be regarded as the most important biomarker in the di group indicating that the md membrane surface in di group was mainly occupied by these thermophilic bacteria in terms of nacl group the md membrane was prevailingly enriched by members of chloroflexi phylum and olb14 class and all the enriched bacteria posed a certain tolerance to the high salinity and high temperature in md system guo and zhang 2014 trabelsi et al 2009 in the fecl3 group four biomarkers with higher lda scores were observed in md membrane biofilms including firmicutes phylum clostridiales order clostridia class sphingobium genus which were gram positive and gram negative bacteria belonging to firmicutes phylum and proteobacteria phylum these enriched bacteria in fecl3 group could well survive in the extreme environment by producing endospores and mostly belonged to the pathogenic bacteria filippidou et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 in comparison zncl2 group was mainly occupied by several biomarkers of proteobacteria phylum betaproteobacteriales order burkholderiaceae family gammaproteobacteria class alphaproteobacteria class sphingomonadales order sphingomonadaceae family and novosphingobium genus and all the enriched bacteria were gram negative belonging to proteobacteria phylum based on the above analysis lefse clearly revealed that the biomarkers were significantly different among these four experimental groups wherein only the gram negative biomarkers appeared in the zncl2 group and the fecl3 group was obviously enriched by several pathogenic bacteria these noteworthy phenomena mainly resulted from the influence of metal accumulations in the md feed side and the specific mechanisms will be discussed in detail in section 3 6 3 6 stress mechanism of salts metals on the md biofilm formation as stated above three main environmental parameters of the md system including temperature salt accumulation and metal accumulation all posed an effect on the md biofouling namely heat stress salt stress and metal stress comparatively the clear accumulation of metals in md system engendered a more significant and more complex influence on biofilm formation the specific stress mechanisms for these three environmental parameters are schematically presented in fig 12 to deeply research the stress mechanisms of temperature and salts metals accumulation the reactive oxygen species ros on the fouled md membrane was quantitatively detected using the fluorescence microscope and the corresponding results are displayed in supplementary fig s12 ros including o2 h2o2 oh etc highly reactive and cytotoxic molecules formed by the incomplete and one electron reduction of o could cause heavy oxidation to biomolecules such as lipids proteins dna etc and then destroy the cell metabolism eventually leading to the microbial death lemire et al 2013 some environmental stressors like t uv radiation ionization salts heavy metals etc were widely reported to cause the generation of endogenous ros by bacteria inducing the severe death of microorganisms das and roychoudhury 2014 flora et al 2008 suzuki et al 2012 in the di group the concentration of inorganic substances like salts and metals always maintained at a relatively low level table 2 thus the biofouling development was mainly affected by the thermal circumstance namely heat stress as shown in fig 12 a several thermolabile bacteria were dead under the heat stress and the md membrane was finally occupied by these thermophile species as confirmed by the lefse analysis fig 11 b c in comparison the production of ros 0 35 and the proportion of dead bacteria 10 2 on the md membrane surface were much lower at the end of the operation as the abrupt change in temperature occurred only in the initial stage of md operation and the microorganisms in feed side would gradually adapt to the thermal environment along with the md operation in nacl group both the heat stress and salt stress existed in the md system leading to a relatively different biofouling behavior on the md membrane fig 12 b the highly concentrated salts nacl in md feed side would cause the imbalance of electrolyte concentration between the feed solution and intracellular fluid of bacteria thus the water molecules would be largely transported from bacterial cells to feed solution and then cause the dehydration of some bacteria lefebvre et al 2012 under the continuous salt stress a clear generation of endogenous ros 3 52 was detected on the md membrane finally relatively higher amounts of dead microbes 90 9 were observed on the md membrane and the attached active bacterial community mainly consisted of halotolerant bacteria and thermophile species fig 11 b c under the metal stress of zn two different stress mechanisms were responsible for the significant death of organisms in zncl2 group namely the zn2 stress mechanism see i in fig 12 c and oxidation stress mechanism see ii in fig 12 c the zn2 stress mechanism meant that the zn2 which were gradually released by zno in solutions could be adsorbed to the negatively charged surface of the bacterium and then damage its biological activity bhadra et al 2011 specifically zno particle in solutions was positively charged as a result of the release of zn2 on its surface which would absorb the negatively charged bacteria to its surface through the coulomb attraction and then the zn2 could penetrate into the bacterial cells upon the penetration of zn2 into bacteria zn2 would largely bind with the active proteases of organisms and then inactivate them finally leading to the death of these microorganisms comparatively the gram positive bacteria with more negative charges were more likely to be absorbed to the surface of zno particles thus only the gram negative biomarkers existed on the membrane at the end of md operation fig 11 b c upon the death of bacteria zn2 would separate from the cells and then continue the above mentioned sterilization process furthermore zno particles could partly react with o2 and h2o in solutions to produce ros for the oxidation of bacterial cells which was the oxidation stress mechanism applerot et al 2009 under the two kinds of stress from zn the microorganisms in the md feed side largely died and the microbial community structure in biofilms was significantly different from that of the di group and nacl group at the end of md operation the zncl2 group demonstrated the highest ros activity with the ratio of fluorescent area up to 46 60 further confirming the remarkable anti biofouling properties of zno particles in the md system in fecl3 group a clear appearance of pathogenic microorganisms was observed on the md membrane during the initial stage see phase i in fig 12 d as the large amounts of fe3 in feed solution partly promoted the growth of these pathogenic bacteria martens et al 2010 with the extended md operation a thick deposit layer containing large amounts of fe oh 3 fe2o3 and fe3o4 gradually formed on the membrane see layer a in phase ii fig 12 d thus the amounts of free fe3 in feed side sharply decreased therefore some specific bacteria appeared in the md system which could take away fe3 from the insoluble compounds iron in the form of oxide and hydroxide by secreting siderophore braun 1997 siderophore a kind of chelating agent could specifically combine with fe3 with a stronger binding force and then formed the iron siderophore complexes in which fe3 was reduced to the more bioavailable fe2 crosa 1989 and then the iron siderophore complexes would specifically bind with the special receptor on the surface of these bacteria kaplan 2002 and then release the fe2 into cells to promote the bacterial metabolism see mechanism a in fig 12 d generally the above mentioned specific bacteria drastically competed with pathogenic microbes for fe3 through the secretion of siderophore inevitably leading to the massive death of pathogenic bacteria during the later period of md operation as confirmed by section 3 5 1 fig 10 as discussed in section 3 5 1 the md membrane was gradually occupied by large amounts of flagellated microorganisms which could rapidly move to the md membrane through their well developed flagella and then adhere tightly to the membrane surface via a holdfast phase ii in fig 12 d some species of these flagellated bacteria could secrete large amounts of extracellular mucus with the main components of polysaccharides and peptides severely promoting the biofilm formation on the md membrane layer b in fig 12 d additionally some other species emerging in fecl3 group would accumulate metabolites specific glycolipids around cells as biological surfactants thus caused the obvious decrement of hydrophobicity of ptfe membrane from the initial 128 5 contact angle of virgin ptfe membrane to around 42 9 contact angle of 15d fouled ptfe membrane in fecl3 group and then a rather severe membrane wetting phenomenon supplementary fig s2 under the above mentioned encouraging biofouling mechanism mechanism a in fig 12 d considerable amounts of active bacteria 45 40 μm3 μm2 were finally detected on the fouled membrane surface furthermore an anti biofouling mechanism mechanism b in fig 12 d also existed in the fecl3 group under the catalytic action of siderophore fe2 in bacterial cells could react with the o2 and h2o2 to form the intenser oxidant of oh cornish and page 1998 leading to a burst of ros and the corresponding bacterial death additionally the extremely low ph of feed solution might be another reason for the obvious death of microbes in fecl3 group table 1 therefore a relatively obvious generation of endogenous ros 8 72 was finally detected on the md membrane generally heat stress salt stress and metal stress all posed certain effects on biofouling development in the md system and a more remarkable influence was observed for metal stress considering the super hydrophobicity and outstanding anti biofouling property of zno membrane modification might be a feasible method for the mitigation of biofouling in the md system in which a layer of zno nanoparticles was applied on the surface of ptfe materials in view of the encouraging biofouling property of iron and the high risk of membrane wetting it is necessary to strictly control the iron concentration in md system during the pretreatment process of feed solutions 4 conclusions in this study the influence of salt and metal accumulation on md biofouling and the corresponding system performance was comprehensively researched especially emphasizing the microbial community succession under the salt metal stress the results led to the following conclusions 1 the membrane flux decline trends of four experiments exhibited obvious differences and the most severe flux decline was obtained for the fecl3 group which might be highly attributed to the conspicuous deposition of fe oh 3 on the membrane comparatively the membrane fouling trend of md was obviously retarded for nacl and zncl2 group which might be highly attributed to the clear death of bacteria under the salt stress and metal stress from zn 2 in fecl3 group a thick fouling layer containing large amounts of inorganics organics and organisms finally formed on the md membrane promoting the significant membrane fouling in the md system a serious scaling layer was observed for the nacl group which induced a sharp flux decline during the later stage of md operation comparatively the zncl2 group exhibited a thin fouling layer containing rather fewer organics inorganics and microorganisms ensuring the continuously stable and high permeate flux of ptfe membrane during the long term md operation 3 compared with the thermal stress and salt stress the environmental factor of metal stress posed a more remarkable impact on the biofilm structure in the md system considering the super hydrophobicity and outstanding anti biofouling property of zno the surface modification of ptfe membrane with a layer of zno nanoparticles might be a feasible method for the mitigation of biofouling in the md system furthermore it is necessary to strictly control the iron concentration in the md system during the pretreatment process in view of the encouraging biofouling property of iron the high propensity to gather pathogenic bacteria in the md system as well as the high risk of membrane wetting
