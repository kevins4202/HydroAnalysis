11705,due to recent advancements in technology a variety of audio magnetotelluric amt geophysical equipment using electric potential difference v as the main parameter for groundwater exploration is now in use studies on the application of electric potential difference in audio magnetotelluric geophysics for groundwater exploration are yet to be published this paper primarily provides an overview of the theoretical background on the use of the electric potential difference in audio magnetotelluric geophysics for groundwater exploration and shares recent field results from the application of the technology in the field test analysis of the lithology data collected during the drilling of two groundwater production boreholes provides meaning to the electric potential difference data collected prior to the drilling results show that the electric potential difference measured with the audio magnetotelluric groundwater detector correlated with lithology and groundwater occurrence at two observation sites the water strikes occurred in sandstone formation of various degrees of disintegration and were associated with contrasts of low electric potential differences in the range of 0 005 0 019 mv the finding suggests that the changes in electric potential difference can be used to delineate potential aquifers and vertical variation of geology the expectations are that this presentation will stimulate further research to understand the applications of audio magnetotelluric electric potential difference technology for groundwater exploration in different hydrogeological settings graphical abstract image 1 keywords aquifers audio magnetotelluric amt hydrogeophysics groundwater exploration groundwater detector electric potential difference data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction geophysical methods are widely applied in groundwater exploration mainly to delineate aquifers and identify drilling targets recent years have seen the groundwater field being flooded with a variety of audio magnetotelluric amt geophysical equipment using electric potential difference v as the main parameter for groundwater exploration most of the equipment appears to be of relatively low cost and rapid to use as compared to the conventional geophysics equipment examples of audio magnetotelluric equipment utilising the electric potential difference include but are not limited to admt series electric groundwater detectors aidu energy technology 2020 and pqwt groundwater detectors pqwt 2022 due to the low cost and easiness of use the technology has been well received and is now being used in many developing countries from the author s working experience there appears to be hesitancy among some groundwater professionals to uptake this technology irrespective of the hesitancy or different opinions it is undeniable that the technology is now widely available and in use at different levels of the profession and its application is growing rapidly perhaps the hesitancy among groundwater professionals on this type of technology is due to limited understanding of the audio magnetotelluric geophysics application in groundwater exploration because traditionally it is not among the conventional common methods this is also evident by the absence of peer reviewed published articles on the application of this technology for groundwater exploration particularly those using electric potential differences a few researchers who have recently used this technology for groundwater exploration were not able to provide any underlying scientific principles for the method nwankwo and udo 2021 ravindran and abishek 2022 kingston et al 2022 some of these researchers have incorrectly used apparent resistivity as the output parameter instead of the electric potential difference ravindran and abishek 2022 kingston et al 2022 the acknowledgment of the equipment s exceptional capability is nevertheless clear in these studies research works addressing the application of electric potential difference in audio magnetotelluric surface geophysics for groundwater exploration are yet to be published this research and information gap is therefore enormous considering that the technology is now widely used with limited scientific insights and reported case studies it has therefore become a matter of urgency to provide a scientific perspective on the application of electric potential difference in audio magnetotelluric geophysics for groundwater exploration with electrical groundwater detectors this paper explores the underlying principles for the use of the electric potential difference in audio magnetotelluric geophysics for groundwater exploration two field tests for groundwater exploration are presented to illustrate the recent experiences with the audio magnetotelluric technology and recommendations for further field studies are made 2 theoretical background a number of surface geophysical methods are used for groundwater exploration examples of the common methods include magnetic electromagnetic seismic magnetic resonance sounding electrical resistivity and magnetotelluric among others magnetic geophysics measures anomalies caused by different magnetic susceptibilities of rocks in the earth s magnetic field and is probably one of the oldest surface geophysical techniques kirsch 2006 on the other hand magnetic resonance sounding makes use of the nuclear magnetic resonance phenomenon of the hydrogen protons of the groundwater to evaluate groundwater potential and other hydraulic properties of the aquifers semenov et al 1988 shirov et al 1991 seismic geophysical exploration evaluates the physical and structural properties of the subsurface based on the propagation of elastic waves inside the earth chandra 2016 in the electromagnetic induction method the transmitter coil is used to generate an electromagnetic field at a specific frequency these are sensed with the receiver coil and analyzed to evaluate the subsurface conductivity kirsch 2006 the electrical resistivity approach applies a measured alternating current ac between the inner electrodes and the ac voltage is measured between the outer electrodes in order to evaluate the subsurface apparent resistivity mandel and shiftan 1981 unlike electromagnetic induction and electrical resistivity which rely on the active source of current the magnetotelluric approach relies on a natural electromagnetic field source to investigate the electrical properties of the earth vozoff 1972 despite the magnetotellurics geophysical method being in existence for many decades it has not been widely applied in groundwater exploration 2 1 basic principles of magnetotelluric geophysics the magnetotelluric method is a passive surface geophysical technique that uses the earth s natural electromagnetic fields to investigate the electric resistivity structure of the subsurface from depths of tens of meters to tens of kilometers vozoff 1972 natural variations of the earth s magnetic and electric fields are measured and recorded at each magnetotelluric station the majority of the signals measured by the magnetotelluric sensors are generated through lightning activity at frequencies of about 1 20 000 hz and geomagnetic micro pulsations at frequencies of about 0 0001 1 hz rodriguez and sampson 2010 when ground electromagnetic waves are send to the ground the wave propagation in the earth and soil follows the maxwell equations 1 and 2 assuming that most of the subterranean geotechnical soil is non magnetic and is uniformly conductive macroscopically there is no charge accumulation the maxwell equation can be simplified to 1 2 h k 2 h 0 2 2 e k 2 e 0 where e v m and h a m are the electric and magnetic fields k is the wavenumber or propagation coefficient 3 k ω 2 μ ε i ω σ μ 1 2 where μ h m is the magnetic permeability ω rad s 1 is the angular frequency σ s m is the electric conductivity the reciprocal being the electric resistivity ρ 1 σ ωm ε f m is the dielectric permittivity when considering that the propagation coefficient k is a complex number let 4 k b i a where a is the phase coefficient and b is the absorption coefficient in the electromagnetic frequency ranges measured by the amt equipment of 0 1 5 khz the displacement current is assumed to be negligible hence can be ignored and k is further simplified as 5 k i ω μ h where h is the skin depth of investigation in principle a changing magnetic field induces a change in electric and the following magnetotelluric relationship exists 6 e h i w ρ k where e h is defined as the surface impedance z which is the ratio of the surface electric field and the horizontal component of the magnetic field 7 7 z ω ρ μ e i π 4 assuming the earth is uniform the impedance is independent of the polarization of the incident field and is related to the earth s resistivity and frequency of the electromagnetic field this principle can be used to determine the apparent resistivity of the earth 8 8 ρ 1 5 f e h 2 the penetration depth of the electromagnetic waves skin depth of investigation h is related to frequency and resistivity equation 9 9 h 503 ρ f 2 2 electric potential difference v in groundwater exploration the electric groundwater detector measures the electric potential difference v in mv the electric potential difference results from the natural electric field in a number of different frequencies of the naturally changing em field for data collection in the field the electric potential difference between two electrodes is measured as the work done in moving a unit of positive charge from electrode 1 to electrode 2 fig 1 more work v has to be done when the resistance between electrodes 1 to electrode 2 is high it is therefore possible that electric potential difference can also be used for groundwater exploration because according to the ohms law it is directly related to the resistivity of the geologic materials between the two electrodes in general a large electric potential difference would be associated with rocks of higher resistivity and these in turn have low groundwater potential whereas low electric potential difference relates to rocks of low resistivity and these could be saturated with groundwater and hence have got a higher groundwater potential the depth h of investigation is derived from equation 9 for the different frequencies of the changing em field through tests a relationship between depth of investigation and frequency can be established using equation 9 such that the equipment can be designed to measure electric potential difference for frequencies that have been established to correspond to specific depths of investigation the output of the equipment becomes depth and electric potential difference which is different from other geoelectrical methods that typically measure apparent resistivity the electric potential difference measurement point is at the center of the electrode spacing 3 methods and materials the two field tests in which a groundwater detector 300 s measuring electric potential difference was used for groundwater exploration are presented the two tests are not meant to provide a rigorous analysis of the field application of electric groundwater detectors but rather share first hand experiences of the technology in groundwater exploration using electric potential difference the goal of reporting field experience is to stimulate further research and reporting of more case studies in groundwater exploration 3 1 description of the observation sites the test site is located in bloemfontein town of south africa fig 2 the test site geologically falls under the karoo supergroup which mainly constitutes sandstone mudstone shale and siltstone sedimentary rocks the sandstones are the productive formation of the karoo aquifers despite their low primary porosity and permeability woodford and chevallier 2002 most of the sediments are well joined fractured and highly variable in thickness extent bedding plane fractures and vertical joints are common features in the sandier facies on the other hand siltstone mudstone facies are dominated by irregular fracture patterns with random orientation and curvilinear joint planes fractured rock aquifers extensively occur in this region fig 3 average borehole yields in the range of 0 1 0 5 l s are expected in this type of hydrogeological setting department of water affairs and forestry 2002 the site is the farm where two groundwater production boreholes were needed from previous experience and drilling records the farmer had budgeted to drill up to 150 m deep vertical groundwater production boreholes consultant experts using other geophysical means had identified the two drilling spots this site offered an opportunity to test the audio magnetotelluric electric groundwater detector in a number of ways firstly the karoo hydrogeological setting is widely understood botha et al 1998 to provide a reference point for testing the technology the main cost of the research materials in particular deeper boreholes was covered by the farmer furthermore there was access to the site to perform the magnetotelluric survey and lithology logging 3 2 data collection processing and analysis two types of data sets in form of electric potential difference depth profiles and borehole lithology were collected the electric potential difference was measured at 5 m depth intervals up to 300 m using audio magnetotelluric electric groundwater detector the manufacturer recommends electrode spacing of 10 m for optimized measurements measurement points were spaced at 2 m for each traverse ten traverses of varying lengths were conducted at the farm but only the ones from the drilled spots are presented the main characteristics of the 300 s electric groundwater detector used in the field are as follows the potential difference measurement range is 0 300 mv with a 0 5 μv resolution has 60 frequency channels that enable simultaneous recording of data measures electric potential difference at 5 m depth intervals up to 300 m and the input impedance is 10 mω although the technology has an inbuilt algorithm to process the data and produce 2 d and 3 d models of electric potential difference it was important to work with raw data for the sake of understanding raw data consisting of electric potential differences for a specific frequency is downloaded the frequency corresponds to the depth of 5 m intervals m up to 300 m to enable better profile visualization the data is plotted on graphs of electric potential difference against depth using microsoft excel it is important to reiterate that the purpose of the audio magnetotelluric survey was not to locate suitable drilling spots but rather to understand how well the measured electric potential difference profiles could be explained by the observations of lithology and groundwater occurrence made during the drilling in order to achieve this goal the electric potential difference data collected prior to the drilling of two groundwater production boreholes were therefore compared with lithology data collected during the drilling 4 results and discussion fig 4 shows the depth profiles of electric potential difference and borehole lithology from the observation sites the lithology results indicate alternating layers of mudstone sandstone and shale which corresponds to the variation of electric potential difference along the vertical profile this shows that the method is able to identify vertical changes in lithology and potential contact zones between lithology or bedding planes bedding planes typically become preferential flow paths for groundwater flow weiss et al 2006 fan et al 2007 hence they can be important targets for groundwater exploration and contamination migration pathways dolerite was also intercepted during the drilling first as weathered in the shallow zones and hard fresh between 55 and 65 m depth at 60 m depth the dolerite was fresh and characterized by a distinct anomaly of elevated electric potential difference up to 0 08 mv this suggests a relatively hard resistive formation expected with fresh dolerite groundwater was found at five distinct depths in the two boreholes fig 4 c and d the groundwater occurred mostly in thin sandstone aquifer layers that are typically characterized by anomalies of low electrical potential difference table 1 due to saturation with groundwater the sandstone layers exhibit a low electric potential difference that ranges from 0 008 to 0 019 mv previous studies have confirmed the sandstone of karoo sediments to be one of the important aquifers in the region botha et al 1998 boreholes at sites 1 and 2 had final blow yields of 0 9 l s and 4 l s respectively which however exceed the expectations of 0 1 0 5 l s yield from the hydrogeology map of the area fig 3 the most likely reason for this difference is that there weren t many deeper boreholes over 100 m at the time 1989 of the hydrogeology map there could therefore need to develop the hydrogeology maps taking into account additional data generated since 1989 the preliminary results suggest that the method has great potential to improve geophysical surveys for groundwater exploration and other groundwater industry investigations identification of vertical contact zones and the depth of potential aquifers is critical to improving drilling success rates in the most cost effective manner there is however a considerable amount of research work that needs to be done in order to improve the understanding of the field application of the method and its related equipment considering that the natural electromagnetic field is affected by a variety of spatial and temporal factors in the natural environment it is therefore likely that the performance of the method would vary from site to site and from time to time research to investigate the application of this method for groundwater exploration in different aquifers and different regions is therefore imminent such investigation can also establish the threshold values of electric potential differences associated with different aquifers in order to provide a guide to field groundwater practitioners it is imperative to compare the performance and conduct a cost benefit analysis with conventional geophysical methods for groundwater exploration other groundwater science related applications such as contaminant mapping need to be investigated 5 conclusion the paper provides scientific insights into the use of the electric potential difference in audio magnetotelluric geophysics for groundwater exploration with a groundwater detector preliminary results from the field test show that changes in electric potential difference correlated to changes in lithology this suggests that the method has the potential to identify geological contact zones which can act as preferential flow paths the water strikes occurred in sandstone formation of various degrees of disintegration and were associated with contrasts of low electric potential differences in the range of 0 005 0 019 mv the results at the observation site suggest that the method has the potential to delineate the depths of aquifers prior to drilling research to understand the application of this technology for groundwater exploration in different hydrogeological settings is recommended declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

egypt that will be reclaimed in the near future fig 1 left therefore the main target of this study is for detection and visualizing the shallow and deep conductive hydro stratigraphic zones i e groundwater aquifers using the dc resistivity and tem methods the relief in the area is non homogenous because the complex geological and structural settings in the region which is located between the nile valley and the western calcareous plateau the relief ranges from 25 m in the east to 225 m in the west where the limestone plateau is located fig 1 the main geomorphological units are the limestone plateau to the west old alluvial plains young alluvial plains fig 1 sand dunes fan glomerates in addition to surface drainage channels which represent valleys said 1981 the limestone plateau is dissected by faults and surface drainage systems fig 2 which are parallel to sub parallel and oriented in the wnw ese and nnw sse direction hassan et al 1978 ghareib 1990 the ancient alluvial plains are located between the slope of the eocene limestone plateau and the cultivated lands and consist of wadi deposits with a slope from west to east by 5 m km el seidy 1995 young plains are made up of clay and silts that overly stratified sand units with the gravel and form the cultivated lands sand dunes are found in belts of various shapes fig 2 abd el mageed 1991 1 2 geology the surficial sedimentary rocks present ranges in age from the middle eocene to the quaternary fig 2 said 1990 the holocene deposits composed of silts and clay with a thickness of 3 12 m occur to the east the pleistocene sediments include sand gravel silt and clay are more evident to the west north and southwest with limestone intercalated with sand their thickness range from 49 to 150 m then the limestone plateau of rayan formation existed in the west consists of eocene limestone the subsurface deposits of tertiary age are divided into deposits from the eocene and pliocene periods the eocene deposits subdivided into upper and middle units with a total thickness of 285 m tamer et al 1974 the middle eocene sediments made up of the rayan formation limestone intercalated with shale sandy shale and marl its thickness of 30 m and overlain by the beni suef formation which consists of limestone and marl and marine shale the upper eocene deposits include of maadi formations limestone and shale with a thickness of 85 m yousif et al 2018 concluded that the exposed rock units range in age from the lower eocene to oligocene these rock units are recognized from the base to top into el minia formation massive limestone with clay intercalations and is up to 36 m thick the samalut formation shale and claystone with limestone at shallow depths then turns into fractured limestone in the lower depths with a thickness of 40 107 m said 1981 the qatrani formation gravelly calcareous sandstone and finally the katkut formation consisting of siltstone and claystone limestone fragments and gravels respectively also yousif et al 2018 observed that the general lineaments orientation is ne sw followed by nw se directions structural lineaments are concentrated to the east and northwest there are many faults and fractures lineament trends within the area under study the pliocene deposits in kom el shelul formation consist of a sandstone layer topped by limestone deposits with sand clay and conglomerates 1 3 hydrogeology geology and topography play a large role in shaping the subsurface hydro geological settings of the area two main shallow aquifers occur the fractured to semi fractured limestone aquifer in the west and quaternary aquifer in the east fig 3 upper panel the fractured limestone of the samalut formation has the greatest aquifer potential in western el minia and its water quality is good shabana 2010 al temamy and abu risha 2016 this aquifer is heterogeneous in terms of the hydrogeologic properties it is moderately productive with a small thickness and intermediate to high salinity of its water al temamy and abu risha 2016 reported that there is a vertical leakage from the deep underlain nubian sandstone aquifer nsa and a horizontal leakage from the water of the nile river in the east to this aquifer mahmoud and kotb 2017 reported that groundwater is found in a shallow part of quaternary deposits and fractured eocene limestone formation and water bearing layer resistivity values increase with the depth because the fracture density decrease the quaternary aquifer is made up of intercalated gravel sand and clay and is considered moderately productive it overlies the fractured limestone aquifer in the eastern parts of the area and occurs as a very thin dry layer in the west this area is also underlain by the deep nubia sandstone aquifer fig 3 lower panel this aquifer is made up of sandstone with shale intercalations and has a moderate productivity and is underlain by basement rocks the shallow fractured limestone aquifer and the deep sandstone aquifer are segregated by two formations namely the khoman formation a white chalk and chalky limestone with chert bands and thin shale beds at base and the abu roash formation a limestone with shale and sandstone interbeds fig 3 lower panel 1 3 1 wells data there are three shallow wells are occurred to the south of the area 7 km the total drilling depths range from 24 to 130 m the discharge rate ranges from 50 to 100 m3 h and the tds ranges mostly from 812 to 4243 ppm but reaches 5261 ppm in some locations there are also two wells located 1 8 km northeast with a total depth of 150 m and 2 14 km east with a total depth 130 m respectively well 1 consists of 15 m dry sand and gravel quaternary deposits 30 m dry limestone 20 m dry marly limestone 35 m clay then the saturated fractured

saturated fractured limestone at depth 97 m the measured salinity in these parts ranges from 2560 to 4243 ppm this fractured aquifer is under confined conditions and was recorded at depths ranging from 85 to 110 m eastward fig 6 2 materials and methods 2 1 dc resistivity method 2 1 1 dc resistivity data acquisition the research institute for groundwater rigw geophysical staff conducted field measurements 7 vertical electrical soundings vess using a syscal r2 resistivity meter and the schlumberger electrode array application with a maximum c1c2 2 ranging from 500 to 700 m the locations of these 7 vess and 8 time domain electromagnetic soundings tems are shown on fig 4 the orientations of vess 1 2 3 6 and 7 are parallel to the limestone plateau in n e direction and those of ves 4 and ves 5 are oriented perpendicular to the limestone plateau in the direction of w e 2 1 2 processing and inversion of dc resistivity data the quantitative interpretation of the apparent resistivity field curves vesc for 7 vess are based on zohdy s and bisdorf 1989 technique to the initial model and the rinvert s software 1999 to the forward and earth inverse model this interpretation aims for determining the electrical parameters that help in separating shallow conductive and resistive layers and in estimating and predicting the hydro geoelectrical characteristics of the shallow conductive water bearing layers with depths according to this inversion as reported at the example for the inverse model of ves2 fig 5 it can accurately detect and separate shallow conductive and resistive layers and describe the lithologies encountered within these layers 2 1 3 hydro geoelectro lithostratigraphic profiles from dc resistivity method from the interpretations of the vess two hydro geoelectro lithostratigraphic profiles a a and b b were mapped for showing the geological hydrogeological electrical and lithostratigraphical conditions of subsurface these profiles showed conductive and resistive zones and their variation with depth fig 6 along these profiles there are four shallow geoelectric layers l1 l1 l2 l3 and l4 l1 l1 is low to medium conductive zone calcareous sand and gravel with clay intercalation to dense limestone l2 is very high conductive zone clay l3 is high conductive zone sand with clay intercalation to fractured limestone and l4 is low to very low conductive zone fractured and semi fractured to dense limestone l3 represent a shallow groundwater aquifer part of quaternary deposits and eocene fractured limestone accordingly the dc resistivity method precisely separates the hydro geoelectro lithostratigraphy of shallow depths these details are generally in agreement with the previous hydrogeological data 2 2 transient electromagnetic tem method 2 2 1 acquisition data of tem method in this method a square loop wire is grounded as the source of the transmitter tx a primary static magnetic field pmf perpendicular to the plane of the transmitter is produced at the time when the electric current is turned on during the electric current is turned off induced electromotive forces are started at ground because primary field decay this results in eddy currents in shallow and deep conductive zones these currents induced currents break through the earth and initiate a secondary magnetic field smf with an amplitude that reduces over time this amplitude is measured by the receiver coil rx at several preset times during the turn off shutdown period the resulted decay curve of the magnetic field db dt reflects the resistivity distribution with depth the termination of the flow of current occurs over a short period of time microsecond which is the ramp off time tem survey carried out by a zonge gdp 3224 multi channel receiver system and the zt 30 transmitter with xmt g as gps locked controller this transmitter was used for measuring the ramp off time a square loop with side lengths of 200 400 m was used for seven tems and a 800 m length was used for one tem sounding the central loop configuration is the applied configuration in this study eight 8 tems were done and distributed at three profiles fig 4 the actual measurement of these tems is that of db dt table 1 shows side length in m ramp off time in μs and frequency in hz for the measured tems figure 7 shows an example for the magnetic field decay voltage curves of tems 1 and 3 with time e t db dt also figure 7 show a plot of the same data converted into early intermediate and late stage voltage and app resistivity of the same tem soundings most of these soundings use the apparent resistivity of the late stage mcneill 1990 and ground resistivity will not be used in early stage due to it is not true particularly at the early gates of this stage and when there are no shallow conductive zones were detected at the last points of this stage and at the intermediate stage as recorded in the area under study using layered 1d models with zonge engineering ρ a app resistivity in ω m at late time is 1 ρ a i a t a r v 2 3 1 t 5 3 x 6 3219 e 3 the depth of diffusion d m is estimated by 2 d 40 t σ 40 ρ a t equivalent depth of investigation d m is estimated by 3 d 28 t σ 28 ρ a t where at and ar is the transmitter and receiver moment m2 respectively i is transmitter current ampere t is time msec v is received voltage μv σ 1 ρ is conductivity s m 2 2 2 processing of tem data and inversion all tem soundings are illustrated as 1d layered models steminv v4 00c first the user selects or define the initiation model multi layers model according to the tems resistivity curves segments and used a forward modeling that gives the best fitting solution to get the inversion inverse model after several iterations this procedure also gives numerous equivalent solutions therefore depending on the previous two models initial and forward models the inversion program tries for fitting the measured data through several iterations for obtaining very small rms r2 fig 7 the right curves in fig 7 show the inversion earth model for computing the model response solid line in the left plots this model of layers explains the vertical determination of the calculated resistivity accordingly several iterations were performed until the rms error residuals are accepted between the measured and calculated apparent resistivity the decay curves were classified into three time stages the early the intermediate and the late time stage fig 7 during the interpretation of these curves it was depended on the intermediate with last part of early stage and late time stages for showing the shallow and deep conductive zones and resistive zones accordingly as appeared on the decay curves it is expected that occurring of shallow aquifer especially at the upper parts of these curves at form of concave shape so the earth resistivity at the intermediate time stage and the last part at the early time stage green oval shape in fig 7 will be interesting in defining the shallow aquifer as detected and confirmed from the dc resistivity method this shallow aquifer is confined because it is occurred between two high resistive layers from upper dry quaternary sediments and lower limestone therefore it believed that because the occurrence of the high conductive layer shallow aquifer which is covered with a very high conductive thin clay layer as well as a thin surface resistive layer the primary magnetic field pmf generates strong induced electromotive force into this shallow aquifer this will refer to increase the density of current which it is slow into this aquifer and it may assist in generating condensed and strong shallow eddy currents these currents produce a secondary magnetic field smf at these shallow depths and their rate will be changed and become strong because the conductivity of clay and shallow aquifer this secondary field was captured in the end of early time stage and it gives an indication about the occurrence of shallow aquifer as well as it taken a longer period of time during the transient process this appeared at the end of the early time stage and the intermediate time stage when the eddy currents begin in diffusion towards the interior of the shallow conductive zone fig 7 then it will be accompanied by a change in the intensity of the magnetic field which will spread and penetrate to greater depths so it could be said that eddy currents have helped doubling penetrating and spreading or diffusing the electromotive force to even greater depths this also has been demonstrated in the penetration of huge thickness of resistive limestone and in the recording of the deep nubian sandstone aquifer as well as at the late time stage is distributed constant with time also this shallow high conductive zone affected the diffusion velocity speed of current flow in the underlain layers which helped in reducing the diffusion velocity speed also it leads to recording deep resistive layers which also increases the diffusion depth and reached approximately 1300 m in some electromagnetic soundings 2 3 effect of ramp off time on shallow depths detecting and its relationship with diffusion depths generally tem method is highly sensitive to the low resistivity layers or very conductive layers because a greater amount of ec flows through these layers the diffusion velocity speed depends on the layer s resistivity i e the diffusion velocity speed is high and low for high resistivity layers and low resistivity layers respectively christiansen et al 2006 the ramp off time effect as stated by stewart and gay 1986 that the accuracy of tem method appears to be limited to shallower depths whereas at large depths the accuracy is limited only by the power of transmitter and background noise the depth to which the ec diffuses is called the diffusion depth the diffusion depth equation was used to estimate and calculate the effect of ramp off time on the investigated or diffusion depth it demonstrates that as the ramp off time increases the shallow affected depth increases this effect decreases when the resistivities of the media decreases this effect appears through the calculated false resistivity values at the shallow depths as appeared in the upper parts of the right panels in fig 7 which should be high in values of resistivity as estimated from the vess interpretation according to the equation below gdp 3224 multi function operation manual it can calculate the ramp off time table 1 as follow 4 t 2 l 1 25 5 r where t is the ramp off time in μs l is the loop side length in meter and r is the resistance of the loop in ω in case of the side lengths of loop were 200 m 400 m and 800 m and their resistances were 4 9ω 9 8 ω and 19 6 ω respectively the equation provides a good calculate of the ramp turn off time it reveals to the ramp time is directly proportional to the side length and inversely to the loop resistance also the diffusion depth δ m of investigation at a given time can calculate from the following equation spies 1989 5 δ 2 t ρ μ 0 1 26 ρ t where t is the time in second ρ is average resistivity in ω m μ0 is the permeability of free air 4π 10 7 h m from the calculation of the diffusion depth table 2 it can be shown the shallow unrecorded depths of the high current diffusion speed and the last diffusion depth it also shows that if the ramp off time is increased the affected depth will be increased fig 9 and reflects the unrecorded shallow depths result from the occurrence of high conductive zones near the surface from depth 3 35 m and these zones created eddy currents near the surface which results in the interference between the primary magnetic field pmf and secondary magnetic field smf in the antenna table 2 shows the resistivities of the shallow depths from vess shallow recorded depths from vess shallow unrecorded depths of high current diffusion speed from tems the ramp off time of the measured tems first diffusion depth after beginning of current turn off and last diffusion depth after ending of current turn off due to the transmitting effect the current turn off time the transient process of receiver coil and the long sampling interval the tem method failed to resolve the shallow target in the vertical direction sun et al 2008 as a result they also stated that the turn off effect was eliminated and the discriminability was enhanced the surface unrecorded high resistive depths from this method are fundamentally related to the surface layer not exceeding 35 m in depth and ranges from 3 m in which quaternary deposits to 35 m and shallow limestone layer table 2 this result from the early time data noisy which resulted due to very fast tx turn off and high current diffusion speed also because the apparent resistivities of this layer in the early stage of time doesn t denote the true resistivities of the earth for the first few gates as appeared in the upper parts of the right panels in fig 7 therefore as nabighian and macnae 1991 everett and meju 2005 ernstson and kirsch 2006a stated from tem soundings that the apparent resistivities of the late time stage is used for defining the deep conductive zones it will be used this stage for determining the deep conductive zones deep aquifer in the area also the last part of the earl time stage and the intermediate time stage will be used for detecting the shallow conductive zones fitterman and anderson 1987 reported that the step for estimating and calculating the effect of a non zero turn off time on the tem response can be applied to forward and inverse computation methods for any transmitter and receiver configuration the ramp effect increases with increasing t 0 and the first layer resistivity is greater during the intermediate time stage and decreases with increasing time for the two layered models when the 1st layer is higher resistive than the 2nd layer ρ 1 ρ 2 the observed resistivity increases in the intermediate time stage as recorded in this study if the 1st layer is higher conductive than the 2nd layer ρ 1 ρ 2 and the layer thickness is comparable to or greater than the radius of loop similar results are obtained however if the layer is thin compared to the radius of loop the apparent resistivity decreases and then increases with increasing time there are many examples presented that show the significant influence of the subsurface geo electrical section on the turn off effect canceling or neglecting the turn off ramp will affect the interpretation of data as appeared in the field examples and the effect is greater on the parameters of the near surface layer therefore the used in loop configuration in this study is greatly affected by near surface resistivity variations as mentioned in table 2 the increasing of the near surface resistivity effect on the diffusion and investigated depths and also on the recording of the shallow depths of high current diffusion speed also it can say that there is no sensitivity to shallow high resistivity depths and this depends on the thickness of these depths from the relationships between the shallow depths resistivity from vess and the first diffusion depths after the start of current turn off from the tems it can be deduced that the recording shallow diffusion depths increases with increasing the shallow depths resistivity fig 8 a also from the relationships between the shallow depths resistivity from vess and the last diffusion depths after termination of current turn off from the tem it can be deduced that deep diffusion depths increase with increasing the shallow depths resistivity fig 8b the relationships between diffusion depth and ramp off time were performed with different shallow resistivity values and different side lengths to show the unrecorded depths of the high current diffusion speed and the latter diffusion depth table 2 and fig 9 from a b these relationships were implemented when the shallow resistivity ρ 254 ω m and the side length of loop 200 m fig 9a when the shallow resistivity ρ 997 ω m and the side length of loop 400 m fig 9b when the shallow resistivity ρ 222 and 255 ω m and the side length of loop 400 m fig 9c and when the shallow resistivity ρ 997 ω m and the side length of loop 800 m fig 9d from these relationships the shallow unrecorded depths increase with increasing the shallow depths resistivity and the side length the diffusion depths increase with increasing the shallow depths resistivity and side lengths table 2 and fig 9 from table 2 there is agreement between the dc resistivity method and tem method in the shallow recorded depths 3 results and discussion 3 1 integration of dc resistivity and tem methods 3 1 1 hydro geoelectro lithostratigraphic profiles after taking the effect of ramp off times in addition to the other preceding factors while interpreting vess and tems the results of shallow geoelectric and deep electromagnetic interpretations were divided into geological layers of five to eight geoelectric layers these layers differ in their true resistivity and thickness fig 10 the details of the hydro geoelectro lithostratigraphic characteristics of these sequences are as follows 3 1 1 1 the 1 st layer it varies in stratigraphy from one place to another as it composed of quaternary sand and gravel with clay and silt intercalations its resistivity ranging from 12 5 ω m when the increase of clay and 2000 ω m with thickness ranging between 1 m and 3 5 m in the north west change to eocene calcareous limestone with sand with an intermediate to high resistivity ranging from 44 to 670 ω m and thickness ranges between 1 m and 19 m this layer covers the eocene dense limestone and marl layer which range its resistivity between 6 ω m when increasing the marl and 738 ω m with thickness of 3 83 m in the rest of the area accordingly this layer has low conductive zone and it is dry 3 1 1 2 the 2 nd layer it made up of clay which characterizes by resistivity ranging from 0 5 ω m and 1 7 ω m with thickness ranging from 21 m to 104 m it is considered as very high conductive zone but it has not free water 3 1 1 3 the 3 rd layer it is characterized by resistivity ranged from 15 to 75 5 ω m it is expected to consist of sand with clay intercalation to fractured eocene limestone with intercalations from the shale and that it represents a shallow aquifer whose thickness is ranging from 34 to 188 5 m it is considered as high conductive zone it was detected at the end of the early time stage and the intermediate time stage of transient process fig 7 the resistivity map of this layer fig 11 upper panel represents the high and very high conductive zones distribution these zones reflect the sites of increase and decrease of clay and clean formations accordingly the fractured limestone was recorded in the western and southern parts while sand with clay intercalation to fractured limestone was recorded in the north along the central portions as it extended to the east as the quaternary aquifer 3 1 1 4 the 4 th layer it is characterized by resistivity ranging from high 174 ω m to very high 2402 ω m it is expected to consist of semi fractured limestone with shale intercalation to dense limestone at some depths it is considered an extension of the aquifer above but is not at all sites and considered as medium to very low conductive zone the thickness of this layer is ranging from 170 m to 218 m and most of depths are dense 3 1 1 5 the 5 th layer it is characterized by resistivity is ranging from 360 to 2853 ω m it is expected to consist of dense limestone with intermediate to low shale intercalation its thickness ranges from 117 to 334 m accordingly this layer is very low conductive zone and dry 3 1 1 6 the 6 th layer it is characterized by resistivity is ranging between 55 ω m and 124 ω m it is expected to consist of semi fractured eocene shaly limestone to fractured shaly limestone the thickness of this layer ranges from 113 to 429 m it is high conductive zone and it is saturated by groundwater and considered the first zone of deep groundwater aquifer 3 1 1 7 the 7 th layer it is characterized by resistivity ranged between 35 ω m and 54 ω m it is expected to consist of high conductive zone of shaly sandstone to sandstone and represents the second zone of the deep aquifer with a thickness of 163 175 m it is saturated with groundwater and considered the main deep aquifer the resistivity distribution map for the 6th and 7th layers fig 11 lower panel represents the high and very high conductive zones that reflect the distribution of pure sandstone and shaly sandstone accordingly the shale content in sandstone increases eastward with increasing water content through decreasing the resistivity values 3 1 1 8 the 8 th layer it is characterized by resistivity greater than 315 ω m and considered as low conductive zone this resistivity value resulted from the effect of the upper high conductive layer 7th layer it is expected to consist of complex basement rocks it is beginning from a depth of 1086 1325 m and represents the base of the deep aquifer it may begin from a relatively lower depths at some locations 3 2 3d fence diagram and hydro lithostratigraphic visualizing models generally as a result of the inferences from the subsurface geological and hydro geological data and the interpretation of ves and tem soundings many geological layers with different structural rock and hydrogeological properties were recorded fig 12 it has been observed that there are eight layers different in their electrical properties the focus has been on the highly conductive zones and their hydro geoelectrical properties which resulted in a severe variation in the rock structural properties as these layers are characterized hydrogeologically into dry and saturated layers groundwater aquifers two groundwater aquifers were recorded one of which is a shallow aquifer composed of sand with intercalation of clay and fractured limestone and is expected to have low to intermediate potential while the other is a deep aquifer made up of fractured shaly limestone and shaly sandstone and considered the main aquifer and is expected to have good potential the 3d models fig 12 showed the variation in the depth to the basement rocks the structural tectonic condition of the geological layers faults the effect of these faults on the hydro geological setting of the groundwater aquifers and the sedimentary basin shape fig 13 this has helped in understanding the complex hydrogeological setting of the area under study which helps in developing an engineering strategy to deal with such complex geological and hydro geological settings 4 conclusion determination of shallow and deep conductive zones and their hydro geoelectro lithostratigraphic conditions were the main objectives of this study using the dc resistivity and tem methods 7 ves and 8 tem soundings described and classified the shallow and deep section into eight conductive and resistive layers the decay curves were classified qualitatively into three stages the last parts at the early stage and the intermediate stage referred to shallow aquifer while the late stage classified the deep zones into conductive and resistive zones the affected depth and the first diffusion depths after the start and termination of current turn off ranged were calculated the data interpretation was further affected by the neglect of the turn off ramp and this effect was the largest on the near surface layer parameters the relationship between diffusion depth and ramp off time were carried out the subsurface layers were divided into eight layers with different resistivity values thicknesses and lithostratigraphic conditions there are two highly conductive zones the shallow zone represents the shallow aquifer while the deep zone represents the deep aquifer the 3d models shown the horizontal and vertical changes of the hydro lithostratigraphic units the faults and the sedimentary basin along the area the complementary between two methods helped in understanding and determining the shallow unrecorded depths of high current diffusion speed the ramp off time effect on shallow depths detection the first and last diffusion depths the effect of shallow resistivity values on the diffusion depth the relationships between diffusion depth and ramp off time at different shallow resistivity values and different side lengths the dc resistivity method was highly sensitive to the shallow low and high conductive zones the tem method was highly sensitive to the shallow and deep high conductive zones and to the deep very low and low conductive zones but it is less sensitive to the shallow resistive depths the last depth of penetration 1300 m obtained using a side length of 400 m was the same as using a side length of 800 m with the same current intensity accordingly it must increase the current intensity in case of side length 800 m to get greater depths than 1300 m and to explore and study the deep aquifers greater than this depth declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

11706,direct current dc resistivity and time domain electromagnetic tem methods were used to distinguish between saturated and dry zones and in an evaluation of groundwater resources in the western desert of egypt dc resistivity method was used to evaluate the shallow section while tem method was used for the shallow and deep aquifer sections in the decay voltage curves the last parts of the early stage and the intermediate stage refer to the shallow aquifer while the late stage indicates the deep aquifer the effect of ramp off time was studied the shallow unrecorded depths of the high current diffusion speed and first and last diffusion depths were determined the resistivity and thickness of surface deposits and loop side length are the prime influences on diffusion investigation

are high conductively zones that corresponds to the shallow and deep aquifers respectively the tem method delineated the sedimentary basin and the maximum penetration depth was 1300 m the complementary of two methods confirmed that the resistivity method is sensitive to shallow conductive and resistive zones while the tem method is sensitive to shallow and deep conductive and resistive zones the tem method assisted in identifying the shallow unrecorded depths the effect of ramp off time diffusion depths and the effect of shallow resistive depths on diffusion depths graphical abstract image 1 keywords direct current resistivity method time domain electromagnetic method conductive zones resistive zones diffusion depths 3d hydro lithostratigraphic visualizing models 1 introduction in general the dc resistivity method can be used in combination with the time domain or transient electromagnetic tem method in hydrogeophysical investigations to evaluate conditions of the subsurface with an emphasis on the conductive zone and the separation between conductive and resistive zones information on structural conditions and the electrical properties of the subsurface provide important constraints for hydrogeological modeling the structural information can be used to identify and map hydro stratigraphic units as well as the fault locations electrical properties can be used in determining the rock and sediments types beside the properties of the water salinity into the pores clay content saturation percentages and water quality and porosity are the interesting factors controlling the resistivity of the subsurface layers liu et al 2009 ammar 2010 ammar and kamal 2018 romero ruiz 2018 ammar and kamal 2019 ammar 2021 electromagnetic em methods are the primary

maghagha city in el minia governorate along the cairo assuit western desert road its ground surface is flat to slightly undulate with lower elevations it lies between latitudes 28o 40 and 28o 42 n and longitudes 30o 34 and 30o 38 e fig 1 it is surrounded on the east by reclaimed lands located within the nile basin region and to the west by the limestone eocene plateau fig 1 right it is part of the arid belt area attia 1989 which has a mediterranean climate that it is hot and dry in summer and cold with some rain in winter the max ranges of temperature are 21 c in january and 37 c in july and the precipitation rate is 6 mm year while the average evaporation rate is around 17 mm day during the summer and the monthly humidity rate varies from 36 in may to 62 in december the reclamation of lands in the desert fringes depends on groundwater in general the dc resistivity and tem methods will be used as part of an evaluation of the groundwater resources in an area of the western desert of egypt that will be reclaimed in the near future fig 1 left therefore the main target of this study is for detection and visualizing the shallow and deep conductive hydro stratigraphic zones i e groundwater aquifers using the dc resistivity and tem methods the relief in the area is non homogenous because the complex geological and structural settings in the region which is located between the nile valley and the western calcareous plateau the relief ranges from 25 m in the east to 225 m in the west where the limestone plateau is located fig 1 the main geomorphological units are the limestone plateau to the west old alluvial plains young alluvial plains fig 1 sand dunes fan glomerates in addition to surface drainage channels which represent valleys said 1981 the limestone plateau is dissected by faults and surface drainage systems fig 2 which are parallel to sub parallel and oriented in the wnw ese and nnw sse direction hassan et al 1978 ghareib 1990 the ancient alluvial

subdivided into upper and middle units with a total thickness of 285 m tamer et al 1974 the middle eocene sediments made up of the rayan formation limestone intercalated with shale sandy shale and marl its thickness of 30 m and overlain by the beni suef formation which consists of limestone and marl and marine shale the upper eocene deposits include of maadi formations limestone and shale with a thickness of 85 m yousif et al 2018 concluded that the exposed rock units range in age from the lower eocene to oligocene these rock units are recognized from the base to top into el minia formation massive limestone with clay intercalations and is up to 36 m thick the samalut formation shale and claystone with limestone at shallow depths then turns into fractured limestone in the lower depths with a thickness of 40 107 m said 1981 the qatrani formation gravelly calcareous sandstone and finally the katkut formation consisting of siltstone and claystone limestone fragments and gravels respectively also yousif et al 2018 observed that the general lineaments orientation is ne sw followed by nw se directions structural lineaments are concentrated to the east and northwest there are many faults and fractures lineament trends within the area under study the pliocene deposits in kom el shelul formation consist of a sandstone layer topped by limestone deposits with sand clay and conglomerates 1 3 hydrogeology geology and topography play a large role in shaping the subsurface hydro geological settings of the area two main shallow aquifers occur the fractured to semi fractured limestone aquifer in the west and quaternary aquifer in the east fig 3 upper panel the fractured limestone of the samalut formation has the greatest aquifer potential in western el minia and its water quality is good shabana 2010 al temamy and abu risha 2016 this aquifer is heterogeneous in terms of the hydrogeologic properties it is moderately productive with a small thickness and intermediate to high salinity of its water al temamy and abu risha 2016 reported that there is a vertical leakage from the deep underlain nubian sandstone aquifer nsa and a horizontal leakage from the water of the nile river in the east to this aquifer mahmoud and kotb 2017 reported that groundwater is found in a shallow part of quaternary deposits and fractured eocene limestone formation and water bearing layer resistivity values increase with the depth because the fracture density decrease the quaternary aquifer is made up of intercalated gravel sand and clay and is considered moderately productive it overlies the fractured limestone aquifer in the eastern parts of the area and occurs as a very thin dry layer in the west this area is also underlain by the deep nubia sandstone aquifer fig 3 lower panel this aquifer is made up of sandstone with shale intercalations and has a moderate productivity and is underlain by basement rocks the shallow fractured limestone aquifer and the deep sandstone aquifer are segregated by two formations namely the khoman formation a white chalk and chalky limestone with chert bands and thin shale beds at base and the abu roash formation a limestone with shale and sandstone interbeds fig 3 lower panel 1 3 1 wells data there are three shallow wells are occurred to the south of the area 7 km the total drilling depths range from 24 to 130 m the discharge rate ranges from 50 to 100 m3 h and the tds ranges mostly from 812 to 4243 ppm but reaches 5261 ppm in some locations there are also two wells located 1 8 km northeast with a total depth of 150 m and 2 14 km east with a total depth 130 m respectively well 1 consists of 15 m dry sand and gravel quaternary deposits 30 m dry limestone 20 m dry marly limestone 35 m clay then the saturated fractured

saturated fractured limestone at depth 97 m the measured salinity in these parts ranges from 2560 to 4243 ppm this fractured aquifer is under confined conditions and was recorded at depths ranging from 85 to 110 m eastward fig 6 2 materials and methods 2 1 dc resistivity method 2 1 1 dc resistivity data acquisition the research institute for groundwater rigw geophysical staff conducted field measurements 7 vertical electrical soundings vess using a syscal r2 resistivity meter and the schlumberger electrode array application with a maximum c1c2 2 ranging from 500 to 700 m the locations of these 7 vess and 8 time domain electromagnetic soundings tems are shown on fig 4 the orientations of vess 1 2 3 6 and 7 are parallel to the limestone plateau in n e direction and those of ves 4 and ves 5 are oriented perpendicular to the limestone plateau in the direction of w e 2 1 2 processing and inversion of dc resistivity data the quantitative interpretation of the apparent resistivity field curves vesc for 7 vess are based on zohdy s and bisdorf 1989 technique to the initial model and the rinvert s software 1999 to the forward and earth inverse model this interpretation aims for determining the electrical parameters that help in separating shallow conductive and resistive layers and in estimating and predicting the hydro geoelectrical characteristics of the shallow conductive water bearing layers with depths according to this inversion as reported at the example for the inverse model of ves2 fig 5 it can accurately detect and separate shallow conductive and resistive layers and describe the lithologies encountered within these layers 2 1 3 hydro geoelectro lithostratigraphic profiles from dc resistivity method from the interpretations of the vess two hydro geoelectro lithostratigraphic profiles a a and b b were mapped for showing the geological hydrogeological electrical and lithostratigraphical conditions of subsurface these profiles showed conductive and resistive zones and their variation with depth fig 6 along these profiles there are four shallow geoelectric layers l1 l1 l2 l3 and l4 l1 l1 is low to medium conductive zone calcareous sand and gravel with clay intercalation to dense limestone l2 is very high conductive zone clay l3 is high conductive zone sand with clay intercalation to fractured limestone and l4 is low to very low conductive zone fractured and semi fractured to dense limestone l3 represent a shallow groundwater aquifer part of quaternary deposits and eocene fractured limestone accordingly the dc resistivity method precisely separates the hydro geoelectro lithostratigraphy of shallow depths these details are generally in agreement with the previous hydrogeological data 2 2 transient electromagnetic tem method 2 2 1 acquisition data of tem method in this method a square loop wire is grounded as the source of the transmitter tx a primary static magnetic field pmf perpendicular to the plane of the transmitter is produced at the time when the electric current is turned on during the electric current is turned off induced electromotive forces are started at ground because primary field decay this results in eddy currents in shallow and deep conductive zones these currents induced currents break through the earth and initiate a secondary magnetic field smf with an amplitude that reduces over time this amplitude is measured by the receiver coil rx at several preset times during the turn off shutdown period the resulted decay curve of the magnetic field db dt reflects the resistivity distribution with depth the termination of the flow of current occurs over a short period of time microsecond which is the ramp off time tem survey carried out by a zonge gdp 3224 multi channel receiver system and the zt 30 transmitter with xmt g as gps locked controller this transmitter was used for measuring the ramp off time a square loop with side lengths of 200 400 m was used for seven tems and a 800 m length was used for one tem sounding the central loop configuration is the applied configuration in this study eight 8 tems were done and distributed at three profiles fig 4 the actual measurement of these tems is that of db dt table 1 shows side length in m ramp off time in μs and frequency in hz for the measured tems figure 7 shows an example for the magnetic field decay voltage curves of tems 1 and 3 with time e t db dt also figure 7 show a plot of the same data converted into early intermediate and late stage voltage and app resistivity of the same tem soundings most of these soundings use the apparent resistivity of the late stage mcneill 1990 and ground resistivity will not be used in early stage due to it is not true particularly at the early gates of this stage and when there are no shallow conductive zones were detected at the last points of this stage and at the intermediate stage as recorded in the area under study using layered 1d models with zonge engineering ρ a app resistivity in ω m at late time is 1 ρ a i a t a r v 2 3 1 t 5 3 x 6 3219 e 3 the depth of diffusion d m is estimated by 2 d 40 t σ 40 ρ a t equivalent depth of investigation d m is estimated by 3 d 28 t σ 28 ρ a t where at and ar is the transmitter and receiver moment m2 respectively i is transmitter current ampere t is time msec v is received voltage μv σ 1 ρ is conductivity s m 2 2 2 processing of tem data and inversion all tem soundings are illustrated as 1d layered models steminv v4 00c first the user selects or define the initiation model multi layers model according to the tems resistivity curves segments and used a forward modeling that gives the best fitting solution to get the inversion inverse model after several iterations this procedure also gives numerous equivalent solutions therefore depending on the previous two models initial and forward models the inversion program tries for fitting the measured data through several iterations for obtaining very small rms r2 fig 7 the right curves in fig 7 show the inversion earth model for computing the model response solid line in the left plots this model of layers explains the vertical determination of the calculated resistivity accordingly several iterations were performed until the rms error residuals are accepted between the measured and calculated apparent resistivity the decay curves were classified into three time stages the early the intermediate and the late time stage fig 7 during the interpretation of these curves it was depended on the intermediate with last part of early stage and late time stages for showing the shallow and deep conductive zones and resistive zones accordingly as appeared on the decay curves it is expected that occurring of shallow aquifer especially at the upper parts of these curves at form of concave shape so the earth resistivity at the intermediate time stage and the last part at the early time stage green oval shape in fig 7 will be interesting in defining the shallow aquifer as detected and confirmed from the dc resistivity method this shallow aquifer is confined because it is occurred between two high resistive layers from upper dry quaternary sediments and lower limestone therefore it believed that because the occurrence of the high conductive layer shallow aquifer which is covered with a very high conductive thin clay layer as well as a thin surface resistive layer the primary magnetic field pmf generates strong induced electromotive force into this shallow aquifer this will refer to increase the density of current which it is slow into this aquifer and it may assist in generating condensed and strong shallow eddy currents these currents produce a secondary magnetic field smf at these shallow depths and their rate will be changed and become strong because the conductivity of clay and shallow aquifer this secondary field was captured in the end of early time stage and it gives an indication about the occurrence of shallow aquifer as well as it taken a longer period of time during the transient process this appeared at the end of the early time stage and the intermediate time stage when the eddy currents begin in diffusion towards the interior of the shallow conductive zone fig 7 then it will be accompanied by a change in the intensity of the magnetic field which will spread and penetrate to greater depths so it could be said that eddy currents have helped doubling penetrating and spreading or diffusing the electromotive force to even greater depths this also has been demonstrated in the penetration of huge thickness of resistive limestone and in the recording of the deep nubian sandstone aquifer as well as at the late time stage is distributed constant with time also this shallow high conductive zone affected the diffusion velocity speed of current flow in the underlain layers which helped in reducing the diffusion velocity speed also it leads to recording deep resistive layers which also increases the diffusion depth and reached approximately 1300 m in some electromagnetic soundings 2 3 effect of ramp off time on shallow depths detecting and its relationship with diffusion depths generally tem method is highly sensitive to the low resistivity layers or very conductive layers because a greater amount of ec flows through these layers the diffusion velocity speed depends on the layer s resistivity i e the diffusion velocity speed is high and low for high resistivity layers and low resistivity layers respectively christiansen et al 2006 the ramp off time effect as stated by stewart and gay 1986 that the accuracy of tem method appears to be limited to shallower depths whereas at large depths the accuracy is limited only by the power of transmitter and background noise the depth to which the ec diffuses is called the diffusion depth the diffusion depth equation was used to estimate and calculate the effect of ramp off time on the investigated or diffusion depth it demonstrates that as the ramp off time increases the shallow affected depth increases this effect decreases when the resistivities of the media decreases this effect appears through the calculated false resistivity values at the shallow depths as appeared in the upper parts of the right panels in fig 7 which should be high in values of resistivity as estimated from the vess interpretation according to the equation below gdp 3224 multi function operation manual it can calculate the ramp off time table 1 as follow 4 t 2 l 1 25 5 r where t is the ramp off time in μs l is the loop side length in meter and r is the resistance of the loop in ω in case of the side lengths of loop were 200 m 400 m and 800 m and their resistances were 4 9ω 9 8 ω and 19 6 ω respectively the equation provides a good calculate of the ramp turn off time it reveals to the ramp time is directly proportional to the side length and inversely to the loop resistance also the diffusion depth δ m of investigation at a given time can calculate from the following equation spies 1989 5 δ 2 t ρ μ 0 1 26 ρ t where t is the time in second ρ is average resistivity in ω m μ0 is the permeability of free air 4π 10 7 h m from the calculation of the diffusion depth table 2 it can be shown the shallow unrecorded depths of the high current diffusion speed and the last diffusion depth it also shows that if the ramp off time is increased the affected depth will be increased fig 9 and reflects the unrecorded shallow depths result from the occurrence of high conductive zones near the surface from depth 3 35 m and these zones created eddy currents near the surface which results in the interference between the primary magnetic field pmf and secondary magnetic field smf in the antenna table 2 shows the resistivities of the shallow depths from vess shallow recorded depths from vess shallow unrecorded depths of high current diffusion speed from tems the ramp off time of the measured tems first diffusion depth after beginning of current turn off and last diffusion depth after ending of current turn off due to the transmitting effect the current turn off time the transient process of receiver coil and the long sampling interval the tem method failed to resolve the shallow target in the vertical direction sun et al 2008 as a result they also stated that the turn off effect was eliminated and the discriminability was enhanced the surface unrecorded high resistive depths from this method are fundamentally related to the surface layer not exceeding 35 m in depth and ranges from 3 m in which quaternary deposits to 35 m and shallow limestone layer table 2 this result from the early time data noisy which resulted due to very fast tx turn off and high current diffusion speed also because the apparent resistivities of this layer in the early stage of time doesn t denote the true resistivities of the earth for the first few gates as appeared in the upper parts of the right panels in fig 7 therefore as nabighian and macnae 1991 everett and meju 2005 ernstson and kirsch 2006a stated from tem soundings that the apparent resistivities of the late time stage is used for defining the deep conductive zones it will be used this stage for determining the deep conductive zones deep aquifer in the area also the last part of the earl time stage and the intermediate time stage will be used for detecting the shallow conductive zones fitterman and anderson 1987 reported that the step for estimating and calculating the effect of a non zero turn off time on the tem response can be applied to forward and inverse computation methods for any transmitter and receiver configuration the ramp effect increases with increasing t 0 and the first layer resistivity is greater during the intermediate time stage and decreases with increasing time for the two layered models when the 1st layer is higher resistive than the 2nd layer ρ 1 ρ 2 the observed resistivity increases in the intermediate time stage as recorded in this study if the 1st layer is higher conductive than the 2nd layer ρ 1 ρ 2 and the layer thickness is comparable to or greater than the radius of loop similar results are obtained however if the layer is thin compared to the radius of loop the apparent resistivity decreases and then increases with increasing time there are many examples presented that show the significant influence of the subsurface geo electrical section on the turn off effect canceling or neglecting the turn off ramp will affect the interpretation of data as appeared in the field examples and the effect is greater on the parameters of the near surface layer therefore the used in loop configuration in this study is greatly affected by near surface resistivity variations as mentioned in table 2 the increasing of the near surface resistivity effect on the diffusion and investigated depths and also on the recording of the shallow depths of high current diffusion speed also it can say that there is no sensitivity to shallow high resistivity depths and this depends on the thickness of these depths from the relationships between the shallow depths resistivity from vess and the first diffusion depths after the start of current turn off from the tems it can be deduced that the recording shallow diffusion depths increases with increasing the shallow depths resistivity fig 8 a also from the relationships between the shallow depths resistivity from vess and the last diffusion depths after termination of current turn off from the tem it can be deduced that deep diffusion depths increase with increasing the shallow depths resistivity fig 8b the relationships between diffusion depth and ramp off time were performed with different shallow resistivity values and different side lengths to show the unrecorded depths of the high current diffusion speed and the latter diffusion depth table 2 and fig 9 from a b these relationships were implemented when the shallow resistivity ρ 254 ω m and the side length of loop 200 m fig 9a when the shallow resistivity ρ 997 ω m and the side length of loop 400 m fig 9b when the shallow resistivity ρ 222 and 255 ω m and the side length of loop 400 m fig 9c and when the shallow resistivity ρ 997 ω m and the side length of loop 800 m fig 9d from these relationships the shallow unrecorded depths increase with increasing the shallow depths resistivity and the side length the diffusion depths increase with increasing the shallow depths resistivity and side lengths table 2 and fig 9 from table 2 there is agreement between the dc resistivity method and tem method in the shallow recorded depths 3 results and discussion 3 1 integration of dc resistivity and tem methods 3 1 1 hydro geoelectro lithostratigraphic profiles after taking the effect of ramp off times in addition to the other preceding factors while interpreting vess and tems the results of shallow geoelectric and deep electromagnetic interpretations were divided into geological layers of five to eight geoelectric layers these layers differ in their true resistivity and thickness fig 10 the details of the hydro geoelectro lithostratigraphic characteristics of these sequences are as follows 3 1 1 1 the 1 st layer it varies in stratigraphy from one place to another as it composed of quaternary sand and gravel with clay and silt intercalations its resistivity ranging from 12 5 ω m when the increase of clay and 2000 ω m with thickness ranging between 1 m and 3 5 m in the north west change to eocene calcareous limestone with sand with an intermediate to high resistivity ranging from 44 to 670 ω m and thickness ranges between 1 m and 19 m this layer covers the eocene dense limestone and marl layer which range its resistivity between 6 ω m when increasing the marl and 738 ω m with thickness of 3 83 m in the rest of the area accordingly this layer has low conductive zone and it is dry 3 1 1 2 the 2 nd layer it made up of clay which characterizes by resistivity ranging from 0 5 ω m and 1 7 ω m with thickness ranging from 21 m to 104 m it is considered as very high conductive zone but it has not free water 3 1 1 3 the 3 rd layer it is characterized by resistivity ranged from 15 to 75 5 ω m it is expected to consist of sand with clay intercalation to fractured eocene limestone with intercalations from the shale and that it represents a shallow aquifer whose thickness is ranging from 34 to 188 5 m it is considered as high conductive zone it was detected at the end of the early time stage and the intermediate time stage of transient process fig 7 the resistivity map of this layer fig 11 upper panel represents the high and very high conductive zones distribution these zones reflect the sites of increase and decrease of clay and clean formations accordingly the fractured limestone was recorded in the western and southern parts while sand with clay intercalation to fractured limestone was recorded in the north along the central portions as it extended to the east as the quaternary aquifer 3 1 1 4 the 4 th layer it is characterized by resistivity ranging from high 174 ω m to very high 2402 ω m it is expected to consist of semi fractured limestone with shale intercalation to dense limestone at some depths it is considered an extension of the aquifer above but is not at all sites and considered as medium to very low conductive zone the thickness of this layer is ranging from 170 m to 218 m and most of depths are dense 3 1 1 5 the 5 th layer it is characterized by resistivity is ranging from 360 to 2853 ω m it is expected to consist of dense limestone with intermediate to low shale intercalation its thickness ranges from 117 to 334 m accordingly this layer is very low conductive zone and dry 3 1 1 6 the 6 th layer it is characterized by resistivity is ranging between 55 ω m and 124 ω m it is expected to consist of semi fractured eocene shaly limestone to fractured shaly limestone the thickness of this layer ranges from 113 to 429 m it is high conductive zone and it is saturated by groundwater and considered the first zone of deep groundwater aquifer 3 1 1 7 the 7 th layer it is characterized by resistivity ranged between 35 ω m and 54 ω m it is expected to consist of high conductive zone of shaly sandstone to sandstone and represents the second zone of the deep aquifer with a thickness of 163 175 m it is saturated with groundwater and considered the main deep aquifer the resistivity distribution map for the 6th and 7th layers fig 11 lower panel represents the high and very high conductive zones that reflect the distribution of pure sandstone and shaly sandstone accordingly the shale content in sandstone increases eastward with increasing water content through decreasing the resistivity values 3 1 1 8 the 8 th layer it is characterized by resistivity greater than 315 ω m and considered as low conductive zone this resistivity value resulted from the effect of the upper high conductive layer 7th layer it is expected to consist of complex basement rocks it is beginning from a depth of 1086 1325 m and represents the base of the deep aquifer it may begin from a relatively lower depths at some locations 3 2 3d fence diagram and hydro lithostratigraphic visualizing models generally as a result of the inferences from the subsurface geological and hydro geological data and the interpretation of ves and tem soundings many geological layers with different structural rock and hydrogeological properties were recorded fig 12 it has been observed that there are eight layers different in their electrical properties the focus has been on the highly conductive zones and their hydro geoelectrical properties which resulted in a severe variation in the rock structural properties as these layers are characterized hydrogeologically into dry and saturated layers groundwater aquifers two groundwater aquifers were recorded one of which is a shallow aquifer composed of sand with intercalation of clay and fractured limestone and is expected to have low to intermediate potential while the other is a deep aquifer made up of fractured shaly limestone and shaly sandstone and considered the main aquifer and is expected to have good potential the 3d models fig 12 showed the variation in the depth to the basement rocks the structural tectonic condition of the geological layers faults the effect of these faults on the hydro geological setting of the groundwater aquifers and the sedimentary basin shape fig 13 this has helped in understanding the complex hydrogeological setting of the area under study which helps in developing an engineering strategy to deal with such complex geological and hydro geological settings 4 conclusion determination of shallow and deep conductive zones and their hydro geoelectro lithostratigraphic conditions were the main objectives of this study using the dc resistivity and tem methods 7 ves and 8 tem soundings described and classified the shallow and deep section into eight conductive and resistive layers the decay curves were classified qualitatively into three stages the last parts at the early stage and the intermediate stage referred to shallow aquifer while the late stage classified the deep zones into conductive and resistive zones the affected depth and the first diffusion depths after the start and termination of current turn off ranged were calculated the data interpretation was further affected by the neglect of the turn off ramp and this effect was the largest on the near surface layer parameters the relationship between diffusion depth and ramp off time were carried out the subsurface layers were divided into eight layers with different resistivity values thicknesses and lithostratigraphic conditions there are two highly conductive zones the shallow zone represents the shallow aquifer while the deep zone represents the deep aquifer the 3d models shown the horizontal and vertical changes of the hydro lithostratigraphic units the faults and the sedimentary basin along the area the complementary between two methods helped in understanding and determining the shallow unrecorded depths of high current diffusion speed the ramp off time effect on shallow depths detection the first and last diffusion depths the effect of shallow resistivity values on the diffusion depth the relationships between diffusion depth and ramp off time at different shallow resistivity values and different side lengths the dc resistivity method was highly sensitive to the shallow low and high conductive zones the tem method was highly sensitive to the shallow and deep high conductive zones and to the deep very low and low conductive zones but it is less sensitive to the shallow resistive depths the last depth of penetration 1300 m obtained using a side length of 400 m was the same as using a side length of 800 m with the same current intensity accordingly it must increase the current intensity in case of side length 800 m to get greater depths than 1300 m and to explore and study the deep aquifers greater than this depth declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

11707,the present study is aimed at finding out spatial distribution of permeability characteristic of soil using ordinary kriging method at any location using the data from a few boreholes at nit national institute of technology patna bihta campus kriging is also popularly known as blue i e best linear unbiased estimator which can be used to interpolate the data obtained from a few locations to get an estimate of any parameter at other locations throughout the study area in the present work soil samples collected from eight boreholes have been tested to obtain various geotechnical properties including liquid limit ll plastic limit pl plasticity index i p coefficient of volume compressibility m v etc these values have been used as inputs in an ordinary kriging model to calculate coefficient of consolidation c v and coefficient of permeability k throughout the nit patna bihta campus and build contour plots of c v and k over the nit patna campus to show their spatial variation the novelty of the current work lies in the first time proposed method for developing the spatial distribution of c v and k markov correlation matrix has been used to develop the correlation behavior of the parameters considering different values of correlation length in the present study it is found that the coefficient of consolidation c v of soil ranges 10 8 m2 sec the kriged values of k are in the range of 10 11 to 10 10 m s finally semi variogram have been shown to display the auto correlation of the measured data points and cross validation of data set which establish that the kriged data are reasonably correlated also various error estimators such as mean error root mean square error average standard error root mean square standard error mean standard error have been calculated using the kriged data points over the entire area and it is found that the error level in the predicted kriged data are reasonably small graphical abstract image 1 keywords coefficient of permeability coefficient of consolidation coefficient of volume compressibility ordinary kriging semi variogram cross validation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the ability of soil to transport liquids or gas through its pores or spaces is known as permeability permeability is a soil attribute that is highly beneficial to researchers interested in researching the characteristics of different soil layers through subsurface geophysical exploration alipour 2007 todd and mays 2004 it is important to have the knowledge of the value of coefficient of permeability k as it is used in analysis and design of various geotechnical structures such as dams embankments foundation etc seepage analysis of any soil deposit requires k as an input coefficient of permeability k of any soil can be measured from the soil samples collected from the field using laboratory tests aigbedion 2007 mohaghegh et al 1997 constant head permeability test is used for the coarser soil like sands and gravels containing little or no silt and the falling head permeability test is used for the fines soil like silts and clays is 2720 part 17 1986 another option would be to use an indirect estimation of k using the values of c v and m v obtained from consolidation test field measurement of coefficient of permeability test can also be done using either pumping in or pumping out test although these tests are rather time consuming and expensive because of the challenges involved the topic has attracted the attention of various researchers balan et al 1995 tang and cheng 1996 nonetheless several advancements in the techniques for determination of permeability have been successfully reported in existing literatures bloch 1991 fernando 2008 yamamoto 2003 regression analysis was performed between index properties indices and c v value acquired from the laboratory and the results revealed that c v value has a strong association with some index properties indices and generated models predict a fair c v value by jadhav 2016 kriging is a geostatistical approach for obtaining unbiased estimates of regionalized variables in specific areas balasundram et al 2007 2008 bayraktar and turalioglu 2005 emery 2005 kriging can be used to calculate the average value of a block or to estimate the value of a variable at a certain point the acronym for it is blue which stands for best linear unbiased estimator negreiros et al 2010 kriging is a linear estimate approach that unlike other methods such as weighted averages and traditional regression considers the spatial dependency of the parameters being analyzed the method was first created for estimating mineral potential in mining engineering krige 1951 and later codified as a more general statistical method matheron 1967 it is currently widely used in a variety of fields to analyze spatially linked data kriging interpolation methods have demonstrated to be effective in a variety of fields of study such as prediction of groundwater level soil salinity soil fertility properties and areal storm pattern analysis rabah et al 2011 sokouti and mahdian 2009 yasrebi et al 2008 previous research has shown that geostatistics may be used to measure and study the regional variability of geotechnical features of site materials such as permeability using georeferenced construction control data smith and konrad 2011 to interpolate spatial data a class of estimators called kriging can be utilized the members of this family are ordinary kriging universal kriging indicator kriging co kriging and others the choice of kriging technique depends on the properties of the data and the intended spatial model ordinary kriging has been found to be a very effective and efficient method to interpolate sparse geospatial data over a larger domain assuming that the underlying random process is inherently stable with a fixed mean across a small area and that variation in the regionalized variable solely depends on the separation in distance and direction between points rather than absolute location ordinary kriging is a type of kriging goovaerts 1997 the most prevalent type of kriging used for a variety of purposes is ordinary kriging it just needs information about spatial variation from the variogram or covariance equation measurements of data points and their location its assumptions are simple to meet and it functions effectively in most situations even if not all assumptions are met webster and oliver 2007 and also help in minimizing the error variance for example ordinary kriging forecasts are found to be the most accurate in forecasting both landslide prone and stable locations as well as being the closest to radar rainfall estimations ip et al 2019 some recent engineering applications of ordinary kriging and co kriging involves estimation of the spatial distribution of ground water quality index gwqi values at the unobserved locations of specified area wang and shafieezadeh 2019 performed reliability analysis through error rate based adaptive kriging or reak that is a highly efficient reliability analysis algorithm with the capability to reduce the number of calls to the performance function lowering computational demand and determining and controlling the error rate of estimated probability of failure xiao et al 2018 developed a co kriging approach to increase approximation accuracy and create varied fidelity data other variations of kriging include indicator kriging simple kriging ordinary kriging and co kriging have been often used to estimate the spatial distribution of data babiker et al 2007 dindaroğlu 2014 gyamfi et al 2016 lee et al 2007 hooshm et al 2011 applied kriging and co kriging techniques to find out the spatial distribution field of the chloride content and sodium adsorption ratio for engineering applications apart from ordinary kriging other geostatistical estimation procedures such as co kriging universal kriging and bayesian kriging have also been used by the researchers all over the world journel 1990 journel and alabert 1990 investigated spatial correlation between porosity and seismic velocity in the field of petro physics one of the most important task is to identify reservoir heterogeneity flow modelling and history matching and appropriate technology must be employed to reduce the variance in estimation while capturing spatial petro physical continuity al mudhafar 2019 2021 co kriging is a procedure that deals with more than one variable has been successfully applied to find out the distribution of permeability characteristics based on porosity as a secondary variable deutsch 2002 if complete secondary variable distribution is available such as porosity or acoustic impedance collocated co kriging has been used successfully by the researchers in the past as the method does not require to establish covariance between the secondary variables doyen et al 1996 universal kriging is usually a very effective choice when it is necessary to establish the trend of related variables such as thickness for finding out the 2d spatial distribution of reservoir xu et al 1992 journel and alabert 1990 developed numerical models for various reservoir attributes involving porosity permeability saturations etc for use as input in transfer function for carrying out flow simulations kriging thus appears to be a very efficient method that uses markov correlation function to demonstrate the correlation between two spatial locations in the petro physical community al mudhafar 2019 however the uncertainty in variogram parameters are usually ignored while building co variance during kriging procedure and this drawback can be addressed by adopting bayesian kriging it considers the uncertainties inherent in variogram parameters i e sill range and nugget diggle et al 2007 the use of bayesian kriging help in developing multiple equiprobable stochastic spatial realizations almost similar to conditional simulation process the variogram is a fundamental tool in geostatistics used for showing auto correlation and measurement errors between the data points under consideration quantitative depiction of spatial system is possible with knowledge of the variogram explicit mathematical form lark 2000 mcbratney and pringle 1999 oliver 1999 it s commonly calculated from data samples by estimating γ h for individual lags and then fitting a continuous function to these estimates mcbratney and webster 1986 akhavan and kia daliri 2010 used spherical model to calculate variogram and shows auto correlation the measurement errors involved in the data points can be further examined by carrying out cross validation test richmond 2002 and zhang 2004 advises refining the model using cross validation after generating a subjective estimate of the model parameters from the plot of γ h kambhammettu et al 2011 worked on estimation of errors in variogram plots cross validation is a trial and error process and many statistics for cross validation are utilized in a relative sense in the present work a method has been suggested based on the ordinary kriging process to obtain a spatial distribution of coefficient of permeability k for entire nit patna bihta campus from eight borehole data to obtain the spatial distribution of k for the entire site one would prefer to obtain as many soil samples as possible from numerous locations in the study area however the available budget would limit us from obtaining soil samples from every location of the site for effectively having an idea of the distribution of k therefore kriging would be an ideal choice for obtaining a spatial distribution profile of the parameter k for the study area and thus would be advantageous to apply for this purpose a kriging model has been built which uses coefficient of consolidation c v and coefficient of volume compressibility m v obtained from one dimensional consolidation test as input variables to the author s knowledge the presented technique of finding out geospatial distribution of the coefficient of permeability k and the coefficient of consolidation c v have not been reported before and this aspect serves the novelty of the present work the variance of the measured data showing the error estimates have also been shown in the form of contour plots furthermore semi variogram plots are made based on the kriged data of k and c v to find the degree of correlation between the data points and cross validation have been done between kriged data points the semi variogram plots are helpful to understand the auto correlation between the plotted data points and cross validation helps in determining the error level between measured and predicted data 2 study area 2 1 site and soil conditions the site of national institute of technology patna is situated at sikandrapur bihta 30 km away from the capital of the state of bihar the area of investigation is a 51 ha plot the site is shown in fig 1 the red square shape on this site plan indicates the location of eight boreholes where the sample is collected and the black line shows the area of the proposed site both undisturbed uds and disturbed samples ds have been collected from the field and respective soil properties of soil are found out by laboratory test 2 2 geotechnical properties of nit patna bihta site the bore log data sheet reveals that subsurface mainly consists of grayish silty clay reddish silty clay mix up to a depth of 10 5 m table 1 shows general soil classification of

limits i e liquid limit ll and plastic limit pl etc the strength parameters such as cohesion c and angle of internal friction φ are found out from drained direct shear test dst one dimensional consolidation tests are performed on samples obtained from different boreholes to measure coefficient of volume compressibility m v in order to develop the kriging model for determination of coefficient of permeability k c v and m v are necessary the variation of standard penetration test spt value w ll pl plasticity index i p coefficient of volume compressibility m v and bulk density γ along the depth of different boreholes are shown in fig 2 a b c d e f and g respectively fig 2 b shows the variation of natural moisture content w with depth d m for eight distinct drill locations for specific soil deposit it also demonstrates that the moisture content w ranges from 12 to 35 similarly fig 2 c shows the variation of liquid limit ll with depth d m for eight distinct drill locations the liquid limit ll is found to vary between 35 and 75 for the site under consideration fig 2 d shows the variation of plastic limit pl with depth d m for eight distinct drill locations the plastic limit pl is found to vary between 20 and 30 fig 2 e shows the variation of plasticity index i p with depth d m for eight distinct drill locations the plasticity index i p is found to vary between 10 and 40 for the site under consideration similarly fig 2 f shows the variation of coefficient of volume compression m v vs depth d m for eight borehole locations and fig 2 g presents the plot of bulk density γ vs depth d m for these drill locations it is revealed that the bulk density γ ranges from 17 64 to 21 85 kn m3 3 methodology this section contains a detailed discussion of the principles terminology and formulations used in this analysis since soil with spatially varying properties is included in this permeability analysis the first step is to gather information from the target site following the acquisition of various soil properties data at various borehole locations an estimation method must be used to estimate the various soil properties data at any unknown borehole site and thus employ a suitable permeability formula to estimate the permeability of foundations by observing soil 3 1 some parameters related to probability theory i mean the mean is a very important property of a random variable since it measures the central tendency if x is a random variable that has a probability density function f x then its average or predicted value μ x is defined as 1 μ x e x x f x i f x 2 μ x e x i f x where e x is called the predicted value or expectation of x ii standard deviation and variance variance is a characteristic of a distribution that tells us about whether the distribution is narrow wide or somewhere in between it is denoted by σ x 2 its square root is called standard deviation σ the variance for a random variable x having probability density function f x x and mean μ x is defined as 3 σ x 2 v a r x e x μ x 2 x x μ x 2 f x for discrete x x μ x 2 f x for continuous x iii coefficient of variation a non dimensional parameter called coefficient of variability is much more useful than standard deviation for getting a relative understanding of the magnitude of variability it s defined as 4 ν σ μ where ν coefficient of variation σ standard deviation and μ mean iv correlation length it is also known as the fluctuation scale and it measures the variance in a random field it is denoted by the symbol λ it can be defined as the distance between two points where there is a significant correlation in our work we assume correlation length value is 200 m which is approximately the distance between the boreholes mathematically the area under the correlation function is specified here as λ 5 λ ρ τ d τ 2 0 ρ τ d τ v correlation function a correlation function is a function that calculates the statistical correlation between random variables based on their spatial or temporal distance x the correlation function that will be used in this analysis must still be established before the above distribution can be found because of its simplicity the markov correlation function is used in the present analysis it asserts that the future is unaffected by the past and is solely a function of the present implying that the conditional likelihood of a future state can be calculated using only current state information according to the markov property the conditional probability of a future state depends only on the current state and not on the past the markov correlation function has the form 6 ρ τ exp 2 τ λ where λ is the correlation length and τ is the lag or separation distance the separation distance is in the form 7 τ i j x i x j where x i and x j are the coordinates of sample points 3 2 estimation estimation is the act of determining a value or approximation that may be used for a specific purpose despite insufficient ambiguous or unstable input data we only have a limited amount of borehole location data but we require data for all places in the area of interest as a result it is necessary to interpolate the data based on the available data for the full area kriging would be a preferred method particularly suitable for this purpose which allows us to estimate any parameter of interest at any place in space using data from a small number of observations i geostatic kriging kriging method can be used to find out the best linear estimate of any random variable parameter of interest at any point in space by interpolating the data obtained from a limited number of observations the kriging method is one of the best linear unbiased estimation methods for estimating a specific mean trend value therefore it is a very suitable method to plot the profile of any parameter of interest over any spatial domain the principle of the kriging method is first introduced by matheron 1963 this approach can also be used to estimate random field data from known data in this technique to estimate x x at any point a weighted linear combination of the values of x at each observation point is used for example let us take x 1 x 2 x n are observations of the random field x x at the points x 1 x 2 x 3 x n that is x k x x k applying the idea of kriging the estimated value of x x at point x is given by 8 x ˆ x k 1 n α k x k where the n unknown weights α k must be determined in order to arrive at the most accurate estimate of possible x x if the point x that has to be estimated is quite close to one of the observation parameters say x j then the weight α j associated with x j would be high and if x x and x j are far from each other than α j should be smaller covariance or correlation between the two points is preferred to calculate the weights rather than distance kriging method considers that the mean can be expressed as shown in equation 9 μ x x i 1 m a i φ i x where a i is unknown coefficient and φ i x is a specified function of x in regression analysis the functions φ 1 x φ 2 x φ 3 x should be linearly independent over the domain usually φ 1 x 1 φ 2 x x φ 3 x x 2 and so on are the usual choices the mean difference between the estimated and real value should be zero if the estimator is impartial the estimated x ˆ x is determined with respect to the true value x x so that the following condition is met 10 i e e x ˆ x x x e x ˆ x e x x 0 if e x x is expressed as a linear combination of independent functions φ i x as e x x i 1 m a i φ i x using undetermined coefficients a i then the expected value of estimated parameter x ˆ x i e e x ˆ x would become 11 e x ˆ x e k 1 n α k x k k 1 n α k i 1 m a i φ i x k when the condition stated in eq 10 is satisfied the equation becomes 12 i 1 m a i k 1 n α k φ i x k φ i x 0 for any a i coefficients the above equation must be valid reducing the unbiased condition to 13 k 1 n α k φ i x k φ i x which is independent of unknown weights a i the unknown kriging weights α k can be obtained by minimizing the variance of error e x x x ˆ x which reduces the solution in a matrix equation k β m where m and k depends on the covariance structure 14 k c 11 c 12 c 1 n φ 1 x 1 φ 2 x 1 φ m x 1 c 21 c 22 c 2 n φ 1 x 2 φ 2 x 2 φ m x 2 c n 1 c n 2 c n n φ 1 x n φ 2 x n φ m x n φ 1 x 1 φ 1 x 2 φ 1 x n 0 0 0 φ 2 x 1 φ 2 x 2 φ 2 x n 0 0 0 φ m x 1 φ m x 2 φ m x n 0 0 0 in which c i j is the covariance between x i and x j furthermore 15 α α i η j m c i x φ j with suffixes i 1 2 3 n and j 1 2 3 m the parameter η i are set of lagrangian parameters which are used to solve the variance minimization problem having unbiased conditions the covariance c i x appearing in the vector on the right hand side rhs of the matrix m is the covariance matrix between the ith observation point and the point x at which the best estimate is to be determined matrix k is solely determined by the locations of observation points and their covariance as a result the inverse of matrix k can be determined only once in the absence of sufficient data the covariance function can be assumed to have a simple functional form take the markovian covariance model in which the covariance decreases exponentially as the separation distance increases τ i j x i x j 16 c i j σ x 2 exp 2 τ i j λ where λ is called the correlation length only two parameters should be estimated in this model i e σ x and λ with the consideration that the field is isotropic and statistically stationary ii error in estimation an error is often associated with the estimation of a random parameter from a finite number of observations this error is then used to determine the estimate s accuracy as a result the kriging calculation is unbiased 17 μ x ˆ x e x ˆ x e x x μ x x the difference between the estimated and the actual can be defined as the error x ˆ x and true value x x i e 18 e x x x ˆ x the mean and variance of the estimator error are given by 19 μ e e x x x ˆ x 0 20 σ e 2 e x x x x σ

can also be taken as conditional mean of x x at point x and σ e 2 is the conditional variance at point x 3 3 coefficient of permeability of soil coefficient of permeability of soil is commonly measured in terms of the rate of water flow through the soil in a given period of time in the present work indirect method is used for estimation of coefficient of permeability k on the basis of coefficient of consolidation c v coefficient of volume compression m v and unit weight of water γ for fine grained soil one dimensional consolidation test can be conducted on the undisturbed soil samples collected from the field to determine c v and m v hence coefficient of permeability k can be calculated using the following expression 21 k c v m v γ w 3 4 coefficient of consolidation the coefficient of consolidation c v is the parameter used to describe the rate at which soil undergoes consolidation or compaction when subjected to an increase in pressure it is measured in square centimeters per second or square inches per minute in the present work the parameter c v is indirectly estimated from plasticity index i p of soil this indirect estimation was necessary because the parameter c v was not determined during laboratory test works and was missing in the report however many researchers had earlier attempted to empirically correlate the parameter c v to other index parameters such as plasticity index i p solanki and desai 2008 gave the following empirical relationship relating c v and i p with coefficient of determination r 2 0 9484 for alluvial silty soils 22 c v 7 7525 i p 3 1021 where c v coefficient of consolidation cm2 sec and i p plasticity index as the site under consideration is situated on the banks of river sone and is filled up with the alluvial deposits from the flow of the river eq 22 is deemed perfectly suitable to estimate the value of coefficient of consolidation c v 3 5 variance of permeability of soil the variance σ k 2 of the estimated coefficient of permeability k at different locations also represents the measure of error involved in the process if coefficient of permeability k is a function of several variables x 1 x 2 x j x m the variance σ k 2 can be calculated using the formula 23 σ k 2 j 1 m k x j σ x j μ 2 where σ 2 variance μ means x j variables and k permeability of soil the variance σ k 2 is required to be determined at the mean value μ of all random variables x j such as i p and m v after substituting the expression of c v from eq 22 in eq 21 the expression of coefficient of permeability k is modified as 24 k 7 7525 i p 3 1021 m v γ w in order to estimate σ k 2 the derivation of eq 24 with respect to random variables x j must be calculated which are as follows 25 k i p 24 09 i p 4 1021 m v γ w and 26 k m v 7 7525 i p 3 1021 γ w similarly σ c v 2 can be estimated from the derivation of eq 22 with respect to random variables x j as 27 c v i p 24 09 i p 4 1021 3 6 study of auto correlation of the output variable using semi variogram the semivariogram is a statistic used in exploratory data analysis that measures the average decline in resemblance between two random variables as the distance between the variables increases semivariogram and covariance curves are fitted to your empirical data through the modelling of semivariogram and covariance functions the objective is to obtain the best fit while also including our understanding of the phenomena in the model for the purpose of making reliable forecasts the model s sill range and nugget are its most crucial features that serve as the error measurement parameters it is effective to apply variogram based techniques such as kriging approaches to help users realize the geometry and continuity of reservoir features gringarten and deutsch 1999 kriging is an observation based interpolation technique to determine any variable z x i at location x i based on values z x 0 at point x 0 where the observation is not available kumar 2007 for any distance vector h the increment z x h z x has zero expectation and finite variance which is independent of the location x intrinsic assumption howarth 1979 the variance of this increment defines semi variogram which is given by 28 γ 1 2 v a r z x h z x from the measured data points an experimental semi variogram by grouping the data pairs according to their distances can be created by 29 γ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z x i h z x i 2 where n h is the number of pairs separated by lag distance h the lag distance h basically represents the average distance between pair of data points 3 7 semivariogram fitting the semivariogram is regarded as a dissimilarity function because the variance of the difference grows with distance there are a few terms that are frequently used in conjunction with this function in geostatistical analysis the sill is the height at which the semivariogram reaches when it levels off it s usually made up of two parts the nugget effect which is a discontinuity near the origin and the partial sill which are combined to form the sill refer to fig 3 measurement inaccuracy and micro scale variation are two subsets of the nugget effect because either component can be zero the nugget effect can be entirely made up of one or the other the range refers to the distance between the semi variogram and the sill the experimental semi variogram depicts the distribution of semi variance values at a certain lag to generate a continuous semi variogram model semi variogram fitting is performed because the variogram model gives important information for interpolation fitting a semi variogram using such a theoretical model is critical fitting may be thought of as a type of regression process analysis the lag h nugget sill and range variables affect the characterization of the geographic data utilized the nugget is the sum of the measurement error plus the variance derived by spatial variation at considerably shorter distances than the sample spacing at a certain separation distance sill is the magnitude of the lag when there is no spatial dependency between semi variance values the range is defined by the value of h where h is the height of the sill these techniques are used in the initial semi variogram model which is fitted with specified functions spherical exponential stable and other uses are among the alternatives the weights are determined from the number of pairings in the weighted least squares method which is the conventional process in the present work the coefficient of permeability k and coefficient of consolidation c v have been estimated by the process of geostatistical kriging procedure the spatial distribution output variables are further used to plot the semi variogram to display the correlation between the measured data points arcgis software has been used for plotting the semi variogram and subsequent fitting of the experimental semi variogram 3 8 cross validation the cross validation process is a simple numerical technique capable of estimating the efficiency and robustness of the prediction model based on a comparative study of observed sample and predicted data we consider cross validation to help determine the variogram model and kriging type a resampling technique called cross validation is used to assess models on a small sample of data that is often regarded superior to the residuals analysis the cross validation method was used to generate error control and recovery algorithms were generated in the hierarchical decomposition of shale reservoirs wang et al 2014 many different statistical algorithms are adopted to predict permeability characteristics such as generalized linear modelling and generalized additive modelling al mudhafar 2016 and the log based binary modelling is used to predict the porosity and permeability of clay rich reservoirs pirrone et al 2014 cross validation provides how well interpolation method predicts the estimated data a jack knife cross validation strategy is commonly used to analyze the outcomes of kriging all of the samples are removed from the data set one by one and the data is re estimated using kriging with the remaining samples the kriging findings are then evaluated by comparing measured data with estimated values webster and oliver 2007 the accuracy of kriging is tested in this study using root mean square error rmse 30 r m s e 1 n i 1 n z x i z x i ˆ 2 where z x i is the estimated value of regionalized variable z at location of i and cross validation is evaluated by calculation of mean error me which should ideally be equal to zero average standard error asm which should be small mean standard error mse and root mean square standard error rmsse there should be close to 1 if the prediction standard errors are valid if the rmsse is greater than 1 then underestimate the variability in your predictions if it is less than 1 then overestimating the variability in your predictions as represented in below equation 31 m e 1 n i 1 n z x i z x i 32 a s e i 1 n σ 2 x i n 33 m s e 1 n i 1 n z x i z x i ˆ σ x i 34 r m s s e 1 n i 1 n z x i z x i ˆ σ x i 2 4 results and discussion this section presents the results of coefficient of permeability data obtained after applying kriging method based on the data from the borehole locations for the entire nit patna bihta campus fig 1 shows the locations of boreholes along with their coordinates for the proposed nit patna bihta campus in order to obtain reliable kriging results it is advised to use 15 to 20 data points warrick and myers 1987 borga and vizzaccaro 1997 emery 2009 however the no of data points should also depend on extent of the area on which kriging interpolation is to be carried out in the present case data from only eight borehole locations were available the soil samples have been collected from eight bore holes dug up to a depth 30 m each at different locations of the site the samples were tested to obtain grain size distribution atterberg s limits i e ll pl etc shear strength parameters i e cohesion c and angle of internal friction φ compression index c c natural moisture content w bulk density γ b specific gravity g and coefficient of volume compressibility m v etc the plasticity index i p is calculated from ll and pl data at different depths coefficient of consolidation c v is obtained using eq 22 afterwards eq 24 is used to determine coefficient of permeability k at different locations of the entire nit patna bihta campus using geostatic kriging procedure the error level in the estimation of k is measured by finding out σ k 2 as explained in section 3 5 after obtaining the estimation of k and σ k 2 at various locations of the nit patna campus contour plots for these two parameters have been prepared these contour plots show the spatial distribution of related parameters for the entire nit patna bihta campus the entire nit patna campus area is discretized using a grid size of approximately 100 m 100 m and resulted in 72 no s of grid points the coordinates of each grid intersection point have been obtained using the coordinate data of each grid intersection points kriging technique is applied to get the best linear unbiased estimate of k at all these locations covariance between any two points have been determined using eq 16 the correlation length λ has been taken equal to 200 m which is approximately equal to the lag distance obtained from semivariogram analysis based on 8 borehole locations data fenton and griffiths 2008 recommended to consider the distance between two sampling points as the correlation length since the properties of soil can be considered to be correlated up to that distance and it is further observed that the considered value of λ match quite well with the distance between any two subsequent boreholes table 2 shows the values of different input parameters along with the estimated values of coefficient of permeability k at different locations of the grid at a depth of 3 0 m from ground level the table also contains the values of the variance σ k 2 of the estimated k values at these locations the values of σ k 2 at these locations also indicates the level of errors involved in the calculation from the data it is evident that the errors in estimated values of k is almost negligible i e in the order of 10 17 table 3 also shows the classification of soils based of the values of coefficient of permeability k after comparing the estimated k values throughout the campus area at a depth of 6 0 m it can be concluded that the k values correspond to the clayey soil fig 4 a and fig 4 b show the contour plot of estimated coefficient of consolidation c v values and the variances σ c v 2 at a depth of d 3 0 m the input values of i p at 3 0 m depth have been fixed at the mean μ x of the respective variables from eight boreholes similar exercise has been performed at depth d 3 0 m fig 4 c and fig 4 d present the contour plots of estimated k and the corresponding variance values σ k 2 at depth d 3 0 m the input values of i p and m v at 3 0 m depth have been fixed at the mean μ x of the respective variables from eight boreholes the contour plots are clearly helpful to understand the spatial distribution of coefficient of consolidation c v and coefficient of permeability k throughout nit patna bihta campus at the respective depths below ground level very low values of σ c v 2 is proof of the fact that the measurement errors are negligibly small fig 5 a and fig 5 b show the contour plot of estimated coefficient of consolidation c v values and the variances σ c v 2 at a depth of d 6 0 m the input values of i p at 3 0 m depth have been fixed at the mean μ x of the respective variables from eight boreholes similar exercise has been performed at depth d 6 0 m fig 5 c and fig 5 d present the contour plots of estimated k and the corresponding variance values σ k 2 at depth d 6 0 m the input values of i p and m v at 6 0 m depth have been fixed at the mean μ x of the respective variables from eight boreholes the contour plots are clearly helpful to understand the spatial distribution of coefficient of consolidation c v and coefficient of permeability k throughout nit patna bihta campus at the respective depths below ground level 4 1 verification of kriging results it is desirable that the kriging model proposed in the present paper should be validated for this purpose few samples were collected from 3 0 m depth and their respective locations are marked as point m n and p refer to fig 1 these samples were tested in laboratory to find out coefficient of permeability k using falling head permeability test as per the guidelines of is 2720 17 1986 table 4 shows the laboratory data of k values at the specific locations along with the kriged data it is observed that the laboratory data of k value match quite well with kriged data 4 2 semi variogram plots the semi variance in the estimation of coefficient of consolidation c v and the coefficient of permeability k is measured by finding out γ h as explained in section 3 6 after obtaining the estimation γ h at various location for designated depths plots of the semi variogram fitting curve for these parameters have been prepared in arcgis software semi variogram model depicts the spatial autocorrelation of measured sample points the purpose of this exercise is to determine the curve s parameters in order to minimize deviations from the points based on some criterion there are a variety of semi variogram models to select from but gaussian models are the most popular in this experiment the average value of semi variance for a particular lag is defined the average value of semi variance is required to build a stable semi variogram fitting process fig 6 a and fig 6 b show the semi variogram plot γ h of estimated coefficient of consolidation c v and the coefficient of permeability k at a depth of d 3 0 m the input value for this estimation is the geo statistically estimated kriged value as mentioned in table 2 in similar way semivariogram plots have been drawn at depth d 6 0 m using the input value for the estimation is the geo statistically estimated kriged value as mentioned in table 3 and presented in fig 6 c and fig 6 d respectively the empirical semi variogram computed through all observed data are fitted by the gaussian model in fig 6 a major ranges of the data points concerning c v is up to 384 m fig 6 b shows that the major range of data points related to k is up to 374 m the partial sills for data points related to c v and k are observed at 1 6026e 17 and 5 7571e 22 respectively also the nugget effects for c v and k can be located at 1 6026e 20 and 5 7571e 25 as shown in fig 6 a and 6 b respectively similar exercises have been performed at depth d 6 0 m fig 6 c and fig 6 d present the spatially empirical semi variogram estimated c v and k at depth d 6 0 m respectively at depth d 6 0 m the major ranges for c v and k of the data points are found to vary up to 546 m 1473 m respectively the partial sills are found at 1 2493e 16 and 7 268e 21 whereas the nugget effects are identified at 2 3411e 17 and 2 6988e 21 for the data points related to c v and k the fitted gaussian model curve are clearly helpful to understand the spatial correlation of coefficient of consolidation c v and coefficient of permeability k throughout nit patna bihta campus at the respective depths below ground level the semi variogram parameters including sill and range that defines amplitude and the distance beyond which autocorrelation is negligible are provided in above fig 6 a to fig 6 d these figures clearly depict the zone at respective depths where significant autocorrelation for the parameters c v and k can be found both c v and k showed spatial autocorrelation and were well behaved as a regionalized variable without any clue of variogram anisotropy it is observed that the variogram have small nugget effects displaying spatial autocorrelation despite no measurement errors the longer auto correlation range represents the more homogenous nature of the measured variable a comparison of 6 a to fig 6 b reveals that coefficient of permeability k is more homogenous than coefficient of consolidation c v at d 3 0 m after observing fig 6 c and fig 6 d it can be concluded on the other hand that coefficient of consolidation c v is more homogenous than coefficient of permeability k at d 6 0 m when plotting a semivariogram the variance steadily rises until the range in the separation distance is attained the empirical semivariogram points are grouped using square cells that are one lag wide to produce the binned values which are shown as red dots in fig 6 a to fig 6 d binning points from empirical semivariogram that lie inside angular sectors produces average points which are shown as blue crosses binned points show local variation in the semivariogram values whereas average values show smooth semivariogram value variation since the averaged values provide a less crowded picture of the spatial autocorrelation in the data and display smoother variations in the semivariogram values than the binned points it is frequently simpler to fit a model to the averaged values for a semivariogram plot nugget sill and partial sill are the parameters that depict the performance the nugget is the sum of the measurement error plus the variance derived by spatial variation at considerably shorter distances than the sample spacing at a certain separation distance sill is the magnitude of the lag when there is no spatial dependency between semi variance values the range is defined by the value of h where h is also known as the height of the sill and it is defined as the range at the longer auto correlation range represents the more homogenous nature of the measured variable these techniques are used in the initial semi variogram model which is fitted with specified functions in fig 6 a fig 6 d of revised manuscript nugget values have been shown at the bottom which is found to be in the range of 10 19 this shows that the sum of the measurement error plus the variance is quite small in the cross validation as shown in fig 7 a to fig 7 d five statistical prediction error parameters namely mean error me and root mean square error rmse average standard error ase mean standard error mse root mean square standard error rmsse have been presented the plots of the cross validation for these parameters have been prepared in arcgis software for the kriged data of both c v and k values these errors at depth 3 0 m and 6 0 m have been presented in table 5 fig 7 a and fig 7 b show the cross validation plot of estimated coefficient of consolidation c v and the coefficient of permeability k at the depth d 3 0 m the input value for this estimation is the geo statistically estimated kriged value as mentioned in table 2 in the similar manner cross validation plots have been drawn at depth d 6 0 m using the input value for the estimation is the geo statistically estimated kriged value as mentioned in table 3 fig 7 c and fig 7 d present the cross validation plots for c v and k at depth d 6 0 m from table 5 it can be seen that the mean error me of the data points concerning c v is 1 208e 11 also the mean error of data points related to k is 9 960e 14 the negligibly small i e nearly equal to zero values of both of these errors prove the unbiasedness of the input data of c v and k values the root mean square error rmse for data points related to c v and k are observed as 2 738e 09 and 1 333e 11 respectively standard error are accurate between measured and predicted data also the average standard error ase for c v and k are observed as 1 906e 09 and 1 199e 11 as shown in fig 7 a and 7 b respectively the small values indicates that the predictions are close to the measured values also the root mean square standardized error rmsse is also close to 1 meaning that standard error is small between measured and predicted data that means that the standard error are accurate between measured and predicted data the validation test shown in fig 7 a gives the observed and predicted value for c v as 1 54e 08 and 1 55e 08 which are quite close similarly characteristics between observed between predicted data have been noticed for the data presented at d 6 0 m plots and summaries of the measured values in comparison to the projected values are provided by the geostatistical analyst fig 7 a 7 d presents scatterplots of projected values vs actual values one may anticipate that these would disperse along the 1 1 line the grey line in the plot shown in figures the slope is often however smaller than 1 as seen in fig 7 a 7 d kriging has the tendency to over predict tiny values while under predicting large ones the equation is supplied immediately below the figure and the fitted line across the dispersion of points is shown in blue these charts illustrate the accuracy of kriging s prediction the blue line would be horizontal if all the data were independent there would be no autocorrelation and all forecasts would be identical each prediction would equal the mean of the observed data the 1 1 grey line should be closer to the blue line with autocorrelation and a decent kriging model each of these plots regression equations is computed using a reliable regression equation the scatterplot is initially fitted with a typical linear regression line using this approach a new regression equation is then computed after removing any points that are more than two standard deviations above or below the regression line this process makes sure that a few outliers won t affect the entire regression equation the root mean square error average standard error and mean error should all be as low as feasible for a model to be considered accurate the root mean squared should be within the range of the average standard errors the ideal square standardized error value is 1 johnston et al 2001 the results of the cross validation of the fitted models are shown in table 5 and they show that the model is acceptable 5 conclusions this paper deals with the application of ordinary kriging to estimate the spatial distribution of k and c v the estimated variance σ 2 error level associated with k and c v for the nit patna bihta campus area a fortran code was developed to carry out kriging at 72 grid point locations from 8 borehole data the study shows that the coefficient of permeability k varies in the range of 10 11 to 10 10 m s at depths 3 0 m and 6 0 m respectively the coefficient of consolidation c v values are found to lie in the range of 10 8 m2 s at both these depths the variance of kriged data of k lies in the range of 10 21 to 10 19 which can be regarded negligibly small similarly the variance of estimated kriged data of c v is found to lie in the range of 10 12 to 10 11 m2 s for all practical purposes such errors in the measured data may be regarded quite satisfactory furthermore laboratory tests to determine coefficient of permeability k have been carried out on samples collected from the field and it is found that the experimental values of k matches well with the predicted data by kriging furthermore the kriged data have been analyzed through several statistical methods the semi variogram have been plotted based on the kriged data of both k and c v at depths d 3 0 m and d 6 0 the small nugget values i e in the range of 10 20 in the semi variogram have revealed there are very less measurement errors reasonably small values of partial sill also establish that maximum variability between measured kriged data of k and c v are considerably less mainly biasedness between measured data and predicted data have been checked with the help of a few statistical error measurement parameters such as me rmse ase mse and rmsse the estimated values of all these parameters show that there is very good agreement with their ideal values that means error between kriged data and the predicted data is reasonably small declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11707,the present study is aimed at finding out spatial distribution of permeability characteristic of soil using ordinary kriging method at any location using the data from a few boreholes at nit national institute of technology patna bihta campus kriging is also popularly known as blue i e best linear unbiased estimator which can be used to interpolate the data obtained from a few locations to get an estimate of any parameter at other locations throughout the study area in the present work soil samples collected from eight boreholes have been tested to obtain various geotechnical properties including liquid limit ll plastic limit pl plasticity index i p coefficient of volume compressibility m v etc these values have been used as inputs in an ordinary kriging model to calculate coefficient of consolidation c v and coefficient of permeability k throughout the nit patna bihta campus and build contour plots of c v and k over the nit patna campus to show their spatial variation the novelty of the current work lies in the first time proposed method for developing the spatial distribution of c v and k markov correlation matrix has been used to develop the correlation behavior

coefficient of consolidation coefficient of volume compressibility ordinary kriging semi variogram cross validation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the ability of soil to transport liquids or gas through its pores or spaces is known as permeability permeability is a soil attribute that is highly beneficial to researchers interested in researching the characteristics of different soil layers through subsurface geophysical exploration alipour 2007 todd and mays 2004 it is important to have the knowledge of the value of coefficient of permeability k as it is used in analysis and design of various geotechnical structures such as dams embankments foundation etc seepage analysis of any soil deposit requires k as an input coefficient of permeability k of any soil can be measured from the soil samples collected from the field using laboratory tests aigbedion 2007 mohaghegh et al 1997 constant head permeability test is used for the coarser soil like sands and gravels containing little or no silt and the falling head permeability test is used for the fines soil like silts and clays is 2720 part 17 1986 another option would be to use an indirect estimation of k using the values of c v and m v obtained from consolidation test field measurement of coefficient of permeability test can also be done using either pumping in or pumping out test although these tests are rather time consuming and expensive because of the challenges involved the topic has attracted the attention of various researchers balan et al 1995 tang and cheng 1996 nonetheless several advancements in the techniques for determination of permeability have been successfully reported in existing literatures bloch 1991 fernando 2008 yamamoto 2003 regression analysis was performed between index properties indices and c v value acquired from the laboratory and the results revealed that c v value has a strong association with some index properties indices and generated models predict a fair c v value by jadhav 2016 kriging is a geostatistical approach for obtaining unbiased estimates of regionalized variables in specific areas balasundram et al 2007 2008 bayraktar and turalioglu 2005 emery 2005 kriging can be used to calculate the average value of a block or to estimate the value of a variable at a certain point the acronym for it is blue which stands for best linear unbiased estimator negreiros et al 2010 kriging is a linear estimate approach that unlike other methods such as weighted averages and traditional regression considers the spatial dependency of the parameters being analyzed the method was first created for estimating mineral potential in mining engineering krige 1951 and later codified as a more general statistical method matheron 1967 it is currently widely used in a variety of fields to analyze spatially linked data kriging interpolation methods have demonstrated to be effective in a variety of fields of study such as prediction of groundwater level soil salinity soil fertility properties and areal storm pattern analysis rabah et al 2011 sokouti and mahdian 2009 yasrebi et al 2008 previous research has shown that geostatistics may be used to measure and study the regional variability of geotechnical features of site materials such as permeability using georeferenced construction control data smith and konrad 2011 to interpolate spatial data a class of estimators called kriging can be utilized the members of this family are ordinary kriging universal kriging indicator kriging co kriging and others the choice of kriging technique depends on the properties of the data and the intended spatial model ordinary kriging has been found to be a very effective and efficient method to interpolate sparse geospatial data over a larger domain assuming that the underlying random process is inherently stable with a fixed mean across a small area and that variation in the regionalized variable solely depends on the separation in distance and direction between points rather than absolute location ordinary kriging is a type of kriging goovaerts 1997 the most prevalent type of kriging used for a variety of purposes is ordinary kriging it just needs information about spatial variation from the variogram or covariance equation measurements of data points and their location its assumptions are simple to meet and it functions effectively in most situations even if not all assumptions are met webster and oliver 2007 and also help in minimizing the error variance for example ordinary kriging forecasts are found to be the most accurate in forecasting both landslide prone and stable locations as well as being the closest to radar rainfall estimations ip et al 2019 some recent engineering applications of ordinary kriging and co kriging involves estimation of the spatial distribution of ground water quality index gwqi values at the unobserved locations of specified area wang and shafieezadeh 2019 performed reliability analysis through error rate based adaptive kriging or reak that is a highly efficient reliability analysis algorithm with the capability to reduce the number of calls to the performance function lowering computational demand and determining and controlling the error rate of estimated probability of failure xiao et al 2018 developed a co kriging approach to increase approximation accuracy and create varied fidelity data other variations of kriging include indicator kriging simple kriging ordinary kriging and co kriging have been often used to estimate the spatial distribution of data babiker et al 2007 dindaroğlu 2014 gyamfi et al 2016 lee et al 2007 hooshm et al 2011 applied kriging and co kriging techniques to find out the spatial distribution field of the chloride content and sodium adsorption ratio for engineering applications apart from ordinary kriging other geostatistical estimation procedures such as co kriging universal kriging and bayesian kriging have also been used by the researchers all over the world journel 1990 journel and alabert 1990 investigated spatial correlation between porosity and seismic velocity in the field of petro physics one of the most important task is to identify reservoir heterogeneity flow modelling and history matching and appropriate technology must be employed to reduce the variance in estimation while capturing spatial petro physical continuity al mudhafar 2019 2021 co kriging is a procedure that deals with more than one variable has been successfully applied to find out the distribution of permeability characteristics based on porosity as a secondary variable deutsch 2002 if complete secondary variable distribution is available such as porosity or acoustic impedance collocated co kriging has been used successfully by the researchers in the past as the method does not require to establish covariance between the secondary variables doyen et al 1996 universal kriging is usually a very effective choice when it is necessary to establish the trend of related variables such as thickness for finding out the 2d spatial distribution of reservoir xu et al 1992 journel and alabert 1990 developed numerical models for various reservoir attributes involving porosity permeability saturations etc for use as input in transfer function for carrying out flow simulations kriging thus appears to be a very efficient method that uses markov correlation function to demonstrate the correlation between two spatial locations in the petro physical community al mudhafar 2019 however the uncertainty in variogram parameters are usually ignored while building co variance during kriging procedure and this drawback can be addressed by adopting bayesian kriging it considers the uncertainties inherent in variogram parameters i e sill range and nugget diggle et al 2007 the use of bayesian kriging help in developing multiple equiprobable stochastic spatial realizations almost similar to conditional simulation process the variogram is a fundamental tool in geostatistics used for showing auto correlation and measurement errors between the data points under consideration quantitative depiction of spatial system is possible with knowledge of the variogram explicit mathematical form lark 2000 mcbratney and pringle 1999 oliver 1999 it s commonly calculated from data samples by estimating γ h for individual lags and then fitting a continuous function to these estimates mcbratney and webster 1986 akhavan and kia daliri 2010 used spherical model to calculate variogram and shows auto correlation the measurement errors involved in the data points can be further examined by carrying out cross validation test richmond 2002 and zhang 2004 advises refining the model using cross validation after generating a subjective estimate of the model parameters from the plot of γ h kambhammettu et al 2011 worked on estimation of errors in variogram plots cross validation is a trial and error process and many statistics for cross validation are utilized in a relative sense in the present work a method has been suggested based on the ordinary kriging process to obtain a spatial distribution of coefficient of permeability k for entire nit patna bihta campus from eight borehole data to obtain the spatial distribution of k for the entire site one would prefer to obtain as many soil samples as possible from numerous locations in the study area however the available budget would limit us from obtaining soil samples from every location of the site for effectively having an idea of the distribution of k therefore kriging would be an ideal choice for obtaining a spatial distribution profile of the parameter k for the study area and thus would be advantageous to apply for this purpose a kriging model has been built which uses coefficient of consolidation c v and coefficient of volume compressibility m v obtained from one dimensional consolidation test as input variables to the author s knowledge the presented technique of finding out geospatial distribution of the coefficient of permeability k and the coefficient of consolidation c v have not been reported before and this aspect serves the novelty of the present work the variance of the measured data showing the error estimates have also been shown in the form of contour plots furthermore semi variogram plots are made based on the kriged data of k and c v to find the degree of correlation between the data points and cross validation have been done between kriged data points the semi variogram plots are helpful to understand the auto correlation between the plotted data points and cross validation helps in determining the error level between measured and predicted data 2 study area 2 1 site and soil conditions the site of national institute of technology patna is situated at sikandrapur bihta 30 km away from the capital of the state of bihar the area of investigation is a 51 ha plot the site is shown in fig 1 the red square shape on this site plan indicates the location of eight boreholes where the sample is collected and the black line shows the area of the proposed site both undisturbed uds and disturbed samples ds have been collected from the field and respective soil properties of soil are found out by laboratory test 2 2 geotechnical properties of nit patna bihta site the bore log data sheet reveals that subsurface mainly consists of grayish silty clay reddish silty clay mix up to a depth of 10 5 m table 1 shows general soil classification of

limits i e liquid limit ll and plastic limit pl etc the strength parameters such as cohesion c and angle of internal friction φ are found out from drained direct shear test dst one dimensional consolidation tests are performed on samples obtained from different boreholes to measure coefficient of volume compressibility m v in order to develop the kriging model for determination of coefficient of permeability k c v and m v are necessary the variation of standard penetration test spt value w ll pl plasticity index i p coefficient of volume compressibility m v and bulk density γ along the depth of different boreholes are shown in fig 2 a b c d e f and g respectively fig 2 b shows the variation of natural moisture content w with depth d m for eight distinct drill locations for specific soil deposit it also demonstrates that the moisture content w ranges from 12 to 35 similarly fig 2 c shows the variation of liquid limit ll with depth d m for eight distinct drill locations the liquid limit ll is found to vary between 35 and 75 for the site under consideration fig 2 d shows the variation of plastic limit pl with depth d m for eight distinct drill locations the plastic limit pl is found to vary between 20 and 30 fig 2 e shows the variation of plasticity index i p with depth d m for eight distinct drill locations the plasticity index i p is found to vary between 10 and 40 for the site under consideration similarly fig 2 f shows the variation of coefficient of volume compression m v vs depth d m for eight borehole locations and fig 2 g presents the plot of bulk density γ vs depth d m for these drill locations it is revealed that the bulk density γ ranges from 17 64 to 21 85 kn m3 3 methodology this section contains a detailed discussion of the principles terminology and formulations used in this analysis since soil with spatially varying properties is included in this permeability analysis the first step is to gather information from the target site following the acquisition of various soil properties data at various borehole locations an estimation method must be used to estimate the various soil properties data at any unknown borehole site and thus employ a suitable permeability formula to estimate the permeability of foundations by observing soil 3 1 some parameters related to probability theory i mean the mean is a very important property of a random variable since it measures the central tendency if x is a random variable that has a probability density function f x then its average or predicted value μ x is defined as 1 μ x e x x f x i f x 2 μ x e x i f x where e x is called the predicted value or expectation of x ii standard deviation and variance variance is a characteristic of a distribution that tells us about whether the distribution is narrow wide or somewhere in between it is denoted by σ x 2 its square root is called standard deviation σ the variance for a random variable x having probability density function f x x and mean μ x is defined as 3 σ x 2 v a r x e x μ x 2 x x μ x 2 f x for discrete x x μ x 2 f x for continuous x iii coefficient of variation a non dimensional parameter called coefficient of variability is much more useful than standard deviation for getting a relative understanding of the magnitude of variability it s defined as 4 ν σ μ where ν coefficient of variation σ standard deviation and μ mean iv correlation length it is also known as the fluctuation scale and it measures the variance in a random field it is denoted by the symbol λ it can be defined as the distance between two points where there is a significant correlation in our work we assume correlation length value is 200 m which is approximately the distance between the boreholes mathematically the area under the correlation function is specified here as λ 5 λ ρ τ d τ 2 0 ρ τ d τ v correlation function a correlation function is a function that calculates the statistical correlation between random variables based on their spatial or temporal distance x the correlation function that will be used in this analysis must still be established before the above distribution can be found because of its simplicity the markov correlation function is used in the present analysis it asserts that the future is unaffected by the past and is solely a function of the present implying that the conditional likelihood of a future state can be calculated using only current state information according to the markov property the conditional probability of a future state depends only on the current state and not on the past the markov correlation function has the form 6 ρ τ exp 2 τ λ where λ is the correlation length and τ is the lag or separation distance the separation distance is in the form 7 τ i j x i x j where x i and x j are the coordinates of sample points 3 2 estimation estimation is the act of determining a value or approximation that may be used for a specific purpose despite insufficient ambiguous or unstable input data we only have a limited amount of borehole location data but we require data for all places in the area of interest as a result it is necessary to interpolate the data based on the available data for the full area kriging would be a preferred method particularly suitable for this purpose which allows us to estimate any parameter of interest at any place in space using data from a small number of observations i geostatic kriging kriging method can be used to find out the best linear estimate of any random variable parameter of interest at any point in space by interpolating the data obtained from a limited number of observations the kriging method is one of the best linear unbiased estimation methods for estimating a specific mean trend value therefore it is a very suitable method to plot the profile of any parameter of interest over any spatial domain the principle of the kriging method is first introduced by matheron 1963 this approach can also be used to estimate random field data from known data in this technique to estimate x x at any point a weighted linear combination of the values of x at each observation point is used for example let us take x 1 x 2 x n are observations of the random field x x at the points x 1 x 2 x 3 x n that is x k x x k applying the idea of kriging the estimated value of x x at point x is given by 8 x ˆ x k 1 n α k x k where the n unknown weights α k must be determined in order to arrive at the most accurate estimate of possible x x if the point x that has to be estimated is quite close to one of the observation parameters say x j then the weight α j associated with x j would be high and if x x and x j are far from each other than α j should be smaller covariance or correlation between the two points is preferred to calculate the weights rather than distance kriging method considers that the mean can be expressed as shown in equation 9 μ x x i 1 m a i φ i x where a i is unknown coefficient and φ i x is a specified function of x in regression analysis the functions φ 1 x φ 2 x φ 3 x should be linearly independent over the domain usually φ 1 x 1 φ 2 x x φ 3 x x 2 and so on are the usual choices the mean difference between the estimated and real value should be zero if the estimator is impartial the estimated x ˆ x is determined with respect to the true value x x so that the following condition is met 10 i e e x ˆ x x x e x ˆ x e x x 0 if e x x is expressed as a linear combination of independent functions φ i x as e x x i 1 m a i φ i x using undetermined coefficients a i then the expected value of estimated parameter x ˆ x i e e x ˆ x would become 11 e x ˆ x e k 1 n α k x k k 1 n α k i 1 m a i φ i x k when the condition stated in eq 10 is satisfied the equation becomes 12 i 1 m a i k 1 n α k φ i x k φ i x 0 for any a i coefficients the above equation must be valid reducing the unbiased condition to 13 k 1 n α k φ i x k φ i x which is independent of unknown weights a i the unknown kriging weights α k can be obtained by minimizing the variance of error e x x x ˆ x which reduces the solution in a matrix equation k β m where m and k depends on the covariance structure 14 k

m x n 0 0 0 in which c i j is the covariance between x i and x j furthermore 15 α α i η j m c i x φ j with suffixes i 1 2 3 n and j 1 2 3 m the parameter η i are set of lagrangian parameters which are used to solve the variance minimization problem having unbiased conditions the covariance c i x appearing in the vector on the right hand side rhs of the matrix m is the covariance matrix between the ith observation point and the point x at which the best estimate is to be determined matrix k is solely determined by the locations of observation points and their covariance as a result the inverse of matrix k can be determined only once in the absence of sufficient data the covariance function can be assumed to have a simple functional form take the markovian covariance model in which the covariance decreases exponentially as the separation distance increases τ i j x i x j 16 c i j σ x 2 exp 2 τ i j λ where λ is called the correlation length only two parameters should be estimated in this model i e σ x and λ with the consideration that the field is isotropic and statistically stationary ii error in estimation an error is often associated with the estimation of a random parameter from a finite number of observations this error is then used to determine the estimate s accuracy as a result the kriging calculation is unbiased 17 μ x ˆ x e x ˆ x e x x μ x x the difference between the estimated and the actual can be defined as the error x ˆ x and true value x x i e 18 e x x x ˆ x the mean and variance of the estimator error are given by 19 μ e e x x x ˆ x 0 20 σ e 2 e x x x x σ

can also be taken as conditional mean of x x at point x and σ e 2 is the conditional variance at point x 3 3 coefficient of permeability of soil coefficient of permeability of soil is commonly measured in terms of the rate of water flow through the soil in a given period of time in the present work indirect method is used for estimation of coefficient of permeability k on the basis of coefficient of consolidation c v coefficient of volume compression m v and unit weight of water γ for fine grained soil one dimensional consolidation test can be conducted on the undisturbed soil samples collected from the field to determine c v and m v hence coefficient of permeability k can be calculated using the following expression 21 k c v m v γ w 3 4 coefficient of consolidation the coefficient of consolidation c v is the parameter used to describe the rate at which soil undergoes consolidation or compaction when subjected to an increase in pressure it is measured in square centimeters per second or square inches per minute in the present work the parameter c v is indirectly estimated from plasticity index i p of soil this indirect estimation was necessary because the parameter c v was not determined during laboratory test works and was missing in the report however many researchers had earlier attempted to empirically correlate the parameter c v to other index parameters such as plasticity index i p solanki and desai 2008 gave the following empirical relationship relating c v and i p with coefficient of determination r 2 0 9484 for alluvial silty soils 22 c v 7 7525 i p 3 1021 where c v coefficient of consolidation cm2 sec and i p plasticity index as the site under consideration is situated on the banks of river sone and is filled up with the alluvial deposits from the flow of the river eq 22 is deemed perfectly suitable to estimate the value of coefficient of consolidation c v 3 5 variance of permeability of soil the variance σ k 2 of the estimated coefficient of permeability k at different locations also represents the measure of error involved in the process if coefficient of permeability k is a function of several variables x 1 x 2 x j x m the variance σ k 2 can be calculated using the formula 23 σ k 2 j 1 m k x j σ x j μ 2 where σ 2 variance μ means x j variables and k permeability of soil the variance σ k 2 is required to be determined at the mean value μ of all random variables x j such as i p and m v after substituting the expression of c v from eq 22 in eq 21 the expression of coefficient of permeability k is modified as 24 k 7 7525 i p 3 1021 m v γ w in order to estimate σ k 2 the derivation of eq 24 with respect to random variables x j must be calculated which are as follows 25 k i p 24 09 i p 4 1021 m v γ w and 26 k m v 7 7525 i p 3 1021 γ w similarly σ c v 2 can be estimated from the derivation of eq 22 with respect to random variables x j as 27 c v i p 24 09 i p 4 1021 3 6 study of auto correlation of the output variable using semi variogram the semivariogram is a statistic used in exploratory data analysis that measures the average decline in resemblance between two random variables as the distance between the variables increases semivariogram and covariance curves are fitted to your empirical data through the modelling of semivariogram and covariance functions the objective is to obtain the best fit while also including our understanding of the phenomena in the model for the purpose of making reliable forecasts the model s sill range and nugget are its most crucial features that serve as the error measurement parameters it is effective to apply variogram based techniques such as kriging approaches to help users realize the geometry and continuity of reservoir features gringarten and deutsch 1999 kriging is an observation based interpolation technique to determine any variable z x i at location x i based on values z x 0 at point x 0 where the observation is not available kumar 2007 for any distance vector h the increment z x h z x has zero expectation and finite variance which is independent of the location x intrinsic assumption howarth 1979 the variance of this increment defines semi variogram which is given by 28 γ 1 2 v a r z x h z x from the measured data points an experimental semi variogram by grouping the data pairs according to their distances can be created by 29 γ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z x i h z x i 2 where n h is the number of pairs separated by lag distance h the lag distance h basically represents the average distance between pair of data points 3 7 semivariogram fitting the semivariogram is regarded as a dissimilarity function because the variance of the difference grows with distance there are a few terms that are frequently used in conjunction with this function in geostatistical analysis the sill is the height at which the semivariogram reaches when it levels off it s usually made up of two parts the nugget effect which is a discontinuity near the origin and the partial sill which are combined to form the sill refer to fig 3 measurement inaccuracy and micro scale variation are two subsets of the nugget effect because either component can be zero the nugget effect can be entirely made up of one or the other the range refers to the distance between the semi variogram and the sill the experimental semi variogram depicts the distribution of semi variance values at a certain lag to generate a continuous semi variogram model semi variogram fitting is performed because the variogram model gives important information for interpolation fitting a semi variogram using such a theoretical model is critical fitting may be thought of as a type of regression process analysis the lag h nugget sill and range variables affect the characterization of the geographic data utilized the nugget is the sum of the measurement error plus the variance derived by spatial variation at considerably shorter distances than the sample spacing at a certain separation distance sill is the magnitude of the lag when there is no spatial dependency between semi variance values the range is defined by the value of h where h is the height of the sill these techniques are used in the initial semi variogram model which is fitted with specified functions spherical exponential stable and other uses are among the alternatives the weights are determined from the number of pairings in the weighted least squares method which is the conventional process in the present work the coefficient of permeability k and coefficient of consolidation c v have been estimated by the process of geostatistical kriging procedure the spatial distribution output variables are further used to plot the semi variogram to display the correlation between the measured data points arcgis software has been used for plotting the semi variogram and subsequent fitting of the experimental semi variogram 3 8 cross validation the cross validation process is a simple numerical technique capable of estimating the efficiency and robustness of the prediction model based on a comparative study of observed sample and predicted data we consider cross validation to help determine the variogram model and kriging type a resampling technique called cross validation is used to assess models on a small sample of data that is often regarded superior to the residuals analysis the cross validation method was used to generate error control and recovery algorithms were generated in the hierarchical decomposition of shale reservoirs wang et al 2014 many different statistical algorithms are adopted to predict permeability characteristics such as generalized linear modelling and generalized additive modelling al mudhafar 2016 and the log based binary modelling is used to predict the porosity and permeability of clay rich reservoirs pirrone et al 2014 cross validation provides how well interpolation method predicts the estimated data a jack knife cross validation strategy is commonly used to analyze the outcomes of kriging all of the samples are removed from the data set one by one and the data is re estimated using kriging with the remaining samples the kriging findings are then evaluated by comparing measured data with estimated values webster and oliver 2007 the accuracy of kriging is tested in this study using root mean square error rmse 30 r m s e 1 n i 1 n z x i z x i ˆ 2 where z x i is the estimated value of regionalized variable z at location of i and cross validation is evaluated by calculation of mean error me which should ideally be equal to zero average standard error asm which should be small mean standard error mse and root mean square standard error rmsse there should be close to 1 if the prediction standard errors are valid if the rmsse is greater than 1 then underestimate the variability in your predictions if it is less than 1 then overestimating the variability in your predictions as represented in below

results of coefficient of permeability data obtained after applying kriging method based on the data from the borehole locations for the entire nit patna bihta campus fig 1 shows the locations of boreholes along with their coordinates for the proposed nit patna bihta campus in order to obtain reliable kriging results it is advised to use 15 to 20 data points warrick and myers 1987 borga and vizzaccaro 1997 emery 2009 however the no of data points should also depend on extent of the area on which kriging interpolation is to be carried out in the present case data from only eight borehole locations were available the soil samples have been collected from eight bore holes dug up to a depth 30 m each at different locations of the site the samples were tested to obtain grain size distribution atterberg s limits i e ll pl etc shear strength parameters i e cohesion c and angle of internal friction φ compression index c c natural moisture content w bulk density γ b specific gravity g and coefficient of volume compressibility m v etc the plasticity index i p is calculated from ll and pl data at different depths coefficient of consolidation c v is obtained using eq 22 afterwards eq 24 is used to determine coefficient of permeability k at different locations of the entire nit patna bihta campus using geostatic kriging procedure the error level in the estimation of k is measured by finding out σ k 2 as explained in section 3 5 after obtaining the estimation of k and σ k 2 at various locations of the nit patna campus contour plots for these two parameters have been prepared these contour plots show the spatial distribution of related parameters for the entire nit patna bihta campus the entire nit patna campus area is discretized using a grid size of approximately 100 m 100 m and resulted in 72 no s of grid points the coordinates of each grid intersection point have been obtained using the coordinate data of each grid intersection points kriging technique is applied to get the best linear unbiased estimate of k at all these locations covariance between any two points have been determined using eq 16 the correlation length λ has been taken equal to 200 m which is approximately equal to the lag distance obtained from semivariogram analysis based on 8 borehole locations data fenton and griffiths 2008 recommended to consider the distance between two sampling points as the correlation length since the properties of soil can be considered to be correlated up to that distance and it is further observed that the considered value of λ match quite well with the distance between any two subsequent boreholes table 2 shows the values of different input parameters along with the estimated values of coefficient of permeability k at different locations of the grid at a depth of 3 0 m from ground level the table also contains the values of the variance σ k 2 of the estimated k values at these locations the values of σ k 2 at these locations also indicates the level of errors involved in the calculation from the data it is evident that the errors in estimated values of k is almost negligible i e in the order of 10 17 table 3 also shows the classification of soils based of the values of coefficient of permeability k after comparing the estimated k values throughout the campus area at a depth of 6 0 m it can be concluded that the k values correspond to the clayey soil fig 4 a and fig 4 b show the contour plot of estimated coefficient of consolidation c v values and the variances σ c v 2 at a depth of d 3 0 m the input values of i p at 3 0 m depth have been fixed at the mean μ x of the respective variables from eight boreholes similar exercise has been performed at depth d 3 0 m fig 4 c and fig 4 d present the contour plots of estimated k and the corresponding variance values σ k 2 at depth d 3 0 m the input values of i p and m v at 3 0 m depth have been fixed at the mean μ x of the respective variables from eight boreholes the contour plots are clearly helpful to understand the spatial distribution of coefficient of consolidation c v and coefficient of permeability k throughout nit patna bihta campus at the respective depths below ground level very low values of σ c v 2 is proof of the fact that the measurement errors are negligibly small fig 5 a and fig 5 b show the contour plot of estimated coefficient of consolidation c v values and the variances σ c v 2 at a depth of d 6 0 m the input values of i p at 3 0 m depth have been fixed at the mean μ x of the respective variables from eight boreholes similar exercise has been performed at depth d 6 0 m fig 5 c and fig 5 d present the contour plots of estimated k and the corresponding variance values σ k 2 at depth d 6 0 m the input values of i p and m v at 6 0 m depth have been fixed at the mean μ x of the respective variables from eight boreholes the contour plots are clearly helpful to understand the spatial distribution of coefficient of consolidation c v and coefficient of permeability k throughout nit patna bihta campus at the respective depths below ground level 4 1 verification of kriging results it is desirable that the kriging model proposed in the present paper should be validated for this purpose few samples were collected from 3 0 m depth and their respective locations are marked as point m n and p refer to fig 1 these samples were tested in laboratory to find out coefficient of permeability k using falling head permeability test as per the guidelines of is 2720 17 1986 table 4 shows the laboratory data of k values at the specific locations along with the kriged data it is observed that the laboratory data of k value match quite well with kriged data 4 2 semi variogram plots the semi variance in the estimation of coefficient of consolidation c v and the coefficient of permeability k is measured by finding out γ h as explained in section 3 6 after obtaining the estimation γ h at various location for designated depths plots of the semi variogram fitting curve for these parameters have been prepared in arcgis software semi variogram model depicts the spatial autocorrelation of measured sample points the purpose of this exercise is to determine the curve s parameters in order to minimize deviations from the points based on some criterion there are a variety of semi variogram models to select from but gaussian models are the most popular in this experiment the average value of semi variance for a particular lag is defined the average value of semi variance is required to build a stable semi variogram fitting process fig 6 a and fig 6 b show the semi variogram plot γ h of estimated coefficient of consolidation c v and the coefficient of permeability k at a depth of d 3 0 m the input value for this estimation is the geo statistically estimated kriged value as mentioned in table 2 in similar way semivariogram plots have been drawn at depth d 6 0 m using the input value for the estimation is the geo statistically estimated kriged value as mentioned in table 3 and presented in fig 6 c and fig 6 d respectively the empirical semi variogram computed through all observed data are fitted by the gaussian model in fig 6 a major ranges of the data points concerning c v is up to 384 m fig 6 b shows that the major range of data points related to k is up to 374 m the partial sills for data points related to c v and k are observed at 1 6026e 17 and 5 7571e 22 respectively also the nugget effects for c v and k can be located at 1 6026e 20 and 5 7571e 25 as shown in fig 6 a and 6 b respectively similar exercises have been performed at depth d 6 0 m fig 6 c and fig 6 d present the spatially empirical semi variogram estimated c v and k at depth d 6 0 m respectively at depth d 6 0 m the major ranges for c v and k of the data points are found to vary up to 546 m 1473 m respectively the partial sills are found at 1 2493e 16 and 7 268e 21 whereas the nugget effects are identified at 2 3411e 17 and 2 6988e 21 for the data points related to c v and k the fitted gaussian model curve are clearly helpful to understand the spatial correlation of coefficient of consolidation c v and coefficient of permeability k throughout nit patna bihta campus at the respective depths below ground level the semi variogram parameters including sill and range that defines amplitude and the distance beyond which autocorrelation is negligible are provided in above fig 6 a to fig 6 d these figures clearly depict the zone at respective depths where significant autocorrelation for the parameters c v and k can be found both c v and k showed spatial autocorrelation and were well behaved as a regionalized variable without any clue of variogram anisotropy it is observed that the variogram have small nugget effects displaying spatial autocorrelation despite no measurement errors the longer auto correlation range represents the more homogenous nature of the measured variable a comparison of 6 a to fig 6 b reveals that coefficient of permeability k is more homogenous than coefficient of consolidation c v at d 3 0 m after observing fig 6 c and fig 6 d it can be concluded on the other hand that coefficient of consolidation c v is more homogenous than coefficient of permeability k at d 6 0 m when plotting a semivariogram the variance steadily rises until the range in the separation distance is attained the empirical semivariogram points are grouped using square cells that are one lag wide to produce the binned values which are shown as red dots in fig 6 a to fig 6 d binning points from empirical semivariogram that lie inside angular sectors produces average points which are shown as blue crosses binned points show local variation in the semivariogram values whereas average values show smooth semivariogram value variation since the averaged values provide a less crowded picture of the spatial autocorrelation in the data and display smoother variations in the semivariogram values than the binned points it is frequently simpler to fit a model to the averaged values for a semivariogram plot nugget sill and partial sill are the parameters that depict the performance the nugget is the sum of the measurement error plus the variance derived by spatial variation at considerably shorter distances than the sample spacing at a certain separation distance sill is the magnitude of the lag when there is no spatial dependency between semi variance values the range is defined by the value of h where h is also known as the height of the sill and it is defined as the range at the longer auto correlation range represents the more homogenous nature of the measured variable these techniques are used in the initial semi variogram model which is fitted with specified functions in fig 6 a fig 6 d of revised manuscript nugget values have been shown at the bottom which is found to be in the range of 10 19 this shows that the sum of the measurement error plus the variance is quite small in the cross validation as shown in fig 7 a to fig 7 d five statistical prediction error parameters namely mean error me and root mean square error rmse average standard error ase mean standard error mse root mean square standard error rmsse have been presented the plots of the cross validation for these parameters have been prepared in arcgis software for the kriged data of both c v and k values these errors at depth 3 0 m and 6 0 m have been presented in table 5 fig 7 a and fig 7 b show the cross validation plot of estimated coefficient of consolidation c v and the coefficient of permeability k at the depth d 3 0 m the input value for this estimation is the geo statistically estimated kriged value as mentioned in table 2 in the similar manner cross validation plots have been drawn at depth d 6 0 m using the input value for the estimation is the geo statistically estimated kriged value as mentioned in table 3 fig 7 c and fig 7 d present the cross validation plots for c v and k at depth d 6 0 m from table 5 it can be seen that the mean error me of the data points concerning c v is 1 208e 11 also the mean error of data points related to k is 9 960e 14 the negligibly small i e nearly equal to zero values of both of these errors prove the unbiasedness of the input data of c v and k values the root mean square error rmse for data points related to c v and k are observed as 2 738e 09 and 1 333e 11 respectively standard error are accurate between measured and predicted data also the average standard error ase for c v and k are observed as 1 906e 09 and 1 199e 11 as shown in fig 7 a and 7 b respectively the small values indicates that the predictions are close to the measured values also the root mean square standardized error rmsse is also close to 1 meaning that standard error is small between measured and predicted data that means that the standard error are accurate between measured and predicted data the validation test shown in fig 7 a gives the observed and predicted value for c v as 1 54e 08 and 1 55e 08 which are quite close similarly characteristics between observed between predicted data have been noticed for the data presented at d 6 0 m plots and summaries of the measured values in comparison to the projected values are provided by the geostatistical analyst fig 7 a 7 d presents scatterplots of projected values vs actual values one may anticipate that these would disperse along the 1 1 line the grey line in the plot shown in figures the slope is often however smaller than 1 as seen in fig 7 a 7 d kriging has the tendency to over predict tiny values while under predicting large ones the equation is supplied immediately below the figure and the fitted line across the dispersion of points is shown in blue these charts illustrate the accuracy of kriging s prediction the blue line would be horizontal if all the data were independent there would be no autocorrelation and all forecasts would be identical each prediction would equal the mean of the observed data the 1 1 grey line should be closer to the blue line with autocorrelation and a decent kriging model each of these plots regression equations is computed using a reliable regression equation the scatterplot is initially fitted with a typical linear regression line using this approach a new regression equation is then computed after removing any points that are more than two standard deviations above or below the regression line this process makes sure that a few outliers won t affect the entire regression equation the root mean square error average standard error and mean error should all be as low as feasible for a model to be considered accurate the root mean squared should be within the range of the average standard errors the ideal square standardized error value is 1 johnston et al 2001 the results of the cross validation of the fitted models are shown in table 5 and they show that the model is acceptable 5 conclusions this paper deals with the application of ordinary kriging to estimate the spatial distribution of k and c v the estimated variance σ 2 error level associated with k and c v for the nit patna bihta campus area a fortran code was developed to carry out kriging at 72 grid point locations from 8 borehole data the study shows that the coefficient of permeability k varies in the range of 10 11 to 10 10 m s at depths 3 0 m and 6 0 m respectively the coefficient of consolidation c v values are found to lie in the range of 10 8 m2 s at both these depths the variance of kriged data of k lies in the range of 10 21 to 10 19 which can be regarded negligibly small similarly the variance of estimated kriged data of c v is found to lie in the range of 10 12 to 10 11 m2 s for all practical purposes such errors in the measured data may be regarded quite satisfactory furthermore laboratory tests to determine coefficient of permeability k have been carried out on samples collected from the field and it is found that the experimental values of k matches well with the predicted data by kriging furthermore the kriged data have been analyzed through several statistical methods the semi variogram have been plotted based on the kriged data of both k and c v at depths d 3 0 m and d 6 0 the small nugget values i e in the range of 10 20 in the semi variogram have revealed there are very less measurement errors reasonably small values of partial sill also establish that maximum variability between measured kriged data of k and c v are considerably less mainly biasedness between measured data and predicted data have been checked with the help of a few statistical error measurement parameters such as me rmse ase mse and rmsse the estimated values of all these parameters show that there is very good agreement with their ideal values that means error between kriged data and the predicted data is reasonably small declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11708,the paper aims to determine the geothermal characteristics and the mixing possibility of bouhanifia and saida geothermal resource because of its importance in tourist activities and energy investigations by using geothermometry and geochemical approaches the methodology of our work is based on physico chemical analysis and thus is validated by the execution of plots and graphs that identify the mixing with cold water and define the geothermal behavior geothermal water is characterized by natural ph ranging between 5 86 and 7 03 furthermore by cation domination water type cl na ca for bouhanifia and cl so4 2 mg2 for saida the silica geothermometers give lower temperatures variation between 12 and 106 c on the other hand the estimated temperature from cationic geothermometers ranges between 51 and 236 c the geothermal is mixed with cold water from saline and carbonated formations results showed that the studied geothermal water chemistry and geothermometry are more affected by local geology and tectonic than regional perspectives therefore the water is influenced by polluted shallow interactions and is classified as a low enthalpy category graphical abstract image 1 keywords geothermometry mixing models geochemical proprieties geothermal aptitudes northwestern algerian data availability the used data is included in the text 1 introduction water management is a global challenge in the current climate situation especially when it comes to an area susceptible to external pollution the bouhanifia and saida waters are characterized by high salinity in their geochemical composition bahri et al 2011 belhai et al 2016 2022 2020 benamar et al 2021 djidi et al 2008 khiati et al 2021 saibi 2009 2015 which is relative to the deep circulation of water through various geological formations belhai et al 2016 benamar et al 2021 khiati et al 2021 the region is defined by recent active tectonic which affected the position of some hot springs and their geochemical composition ayadi et al 2002 benamar et al 2021 in addition the complex local geology is mainly observed by the difference of facies between bouhanifia and saida areas according to the large faults network of ne sw orientations aïfa et al 2003 bouyahiaoui et al 2017 dalloni 1926 khiati et al 2021 yelles chaouche et al 2006 however in the local context the regions especially the bouhanifia area remain understudied bouhanifia and saida area belong to the north african thermal system exactly in the northwest of algeria fig 1 a they appertain to mascara state algerian administrative city and saida state respectively fig 1 b the regions of bouhanifia geothermal area and saida area located at 230 m and 500 1150 m respectively are a part of the oranian tell it is surrounded by benichougran mountains in the northeast with 800 m of altitude and by the saida karstic mountains 1200 m in the southeast the 80 km long ghriss rural plain is located between the bouhanifia and saida geothermal fields the climate is semi arid with annual average temperatures of 18 c and 16 85 c for bouhanifia and saida respectively belhai et al 2014 chentout et al 2015 djidi et al 2008 gliz et al 2015 lakrout et al 2022 anteur et al 2015 therefore geothermal water is characterized by natural ph and discharge temperatures oscillate between 26 and 65 c our methodology depends on field investigations as well as laboratory and simulation works thus the elaboration of the physico chemical analysis and the execution of graphs and plots help to understand the geothermal behavior of water belhai et al 2022 bouaicha et al 2019 hamed et al 2011 kouadra et al 2019 madrid and zayas 2007 shah et al 2019 2021b strelbitskaya 2005 this work has the objective to define the influence of the local geology and tectonic moreover the mixing possibilities in water hydrochemistry and geothermometry separately from the regional characterizations of our study area for this reason and in order to the management of the geothermal resource the application of the mixing model geo indicator graphs and hydrochemical plots is useful to identify the eventual pollution sources the geological origins and the water potential belhai et al 2016 benmarce et al 2021 bouaicha et al 2017 bouselsal and saibi 2022 chatterjee et al 2017 kouadra et al 2019 khous et al 2019 2021 shah et al 2019 2021 strelbitskaya 2005 as well as the estimated temperatures of the reservoir by the application of silica and cationic geothermometers to determine the geothermal properties insight the ion exchange and silica content of water in high temperature conditions das et al 2021 debonne 2015 yasin and kargın 2021 dávalos elizondo et al 2021 karingithi 2009 morales arredondo et al 2018 pasvanoğlu 2020 2 geology and tectonic of the study area 2 1 geology of bouhanifia the geological and tectonic framework is essential to understanding the geothermal properties of our studied thermal water our region belongs to the surrounding maghrebines alpine fold belts saibi 2009 according to the local geological card of mascara dalloni 1926 the main dominant formations are eocene aged of marl and limestone fig 2 and outcropping has overlain the position of the hot springs discharge the quaternary is represented as a superficial aquifer around mascara by alluvial and travertine formations chentout et al 2015 therefore the miocene formations are characterized by marine facies known in the upper miocene tortonian formations by sandstone sand and marl in addition to altered marl and sand in the middle miocene helvetian formations of pounding and sandstone and the lower miocene by aquitaine sedimentary formations of altered silt with sandstone and pounding benamar et al 2021 the cretaceous aquifer is defined by carbonated formations of sandstone and marl mainly developed in the benichougran mountains with around 200 m of thickness moreover is considered at the top of the geothermal reservoir of dolomite and limestone formations of jurassic with more than 1500 m of thickness benamar et al 2021 the hydrogeological substratum of our thermal area is outcropping in the northeast of bouhanifia by the triassic formation of halite gypsum and anhydrite 2 2 geology of saida the saida region is mainly constituted by mesozoic and tertiary sediments while the carbonated formations of jurassic outcropping in the saida mountains represent 40 of the area hence defined as a regional aquifer of saida and bouhanifia water djidi et al 2008 the quaternary is composed of old and recent alluvial silt and conglomerate mainly developed around saida city and saida mountains fig 3 the miocene in saida region is known for its continental layer of conglomerate and sandstone successive by cretaceous formations of white limestone with 100 m of thickness khiati et al 2021 the large anticlinal of saida mountains is defined by lower middle jurassic of dolomite limestone and marl in addition saida clay and sandstone formations are attributed to upper jurassic callovo oxfordian about 300 m of thickness bentabet et al 2019 therefore the trias is manifested north of saida mainly constituted by evaporated formations of gypsum and halite the paleozoic basement is observed in the east of the hot spring sa02 sidi ammar summit outcropping by metamorphic formations of shale and primary quartz dahmani 2016 the geothermal area is limited in the south by chott ech chergui fig 3 which is a submerged zone known by sabkhas the cold and the thermal waters of this area are characterized by high salinity in their geochemical composition aoudia et al 2020 2 3 structural analysis the recent tectonic of the region is characterized by a series of trust sheet and echelons folds within ene wsw orientation and large faults network mainly created in mio plio quaternary periods during the movement of african and iberian plats belhai et al 2016 the alluvial formations are deposed abnormally on eocene formations in the thermal spring discharge zone is likely justified by the influence of hussein earthquake which affects the position of the hot springs ayadi et al 2002 3 methodology of sampling and analysis the execution of cationic and silica geothermometers to determine the estimated temperatures of the water in the reservoir depends on the physico chemical analysis in our case of study the chemical analysis of water was operated from 14 samples of bouhanifia and saida hot springs the sampling was effectuated in october 2018 with 5 samples from the bouhanifia area labeled bnf and 9 of saida water labeled sa from a homogeneous representation of water with the use of appropriate means and materials new and sterile borosilicate glass bottles the temperature ph and electrical conductivity were measured in situ with multi parameter hanna instruments hi9828 ph orp ec do after filtration samples were conserved at 4 c in a dark environment until transported to the laboratory madrid and zayas 2007 the cations na ca2 mg2 k li and anions hco3 no3 cl f br so4 2 were determined with the application of the performance ion liquid chromatography method hpilc dionex dx120 the validation for precision sensitivity and linearity was applied by using mixture solutions dionex cation standard for cations from which four dilutions were performed and filtered through a 0 45 μm filter the anion mixed standard solution were used for anions after the application of 3 dilutions sellam 2012 the accuracy was deduced by limit of detection lod relative to anions about of 0 25 0 54 1 23 and 1 07 ppm for f cl no3 and so4 2 respectively furthermore of cations about of 0 41 0 73 0 74 0 08 and 5 12 ppm for na mg2 k li and ca2 respectively dawood and sanad 2014 fa et al 2018 the total alkalinity hco3 was measured by the potentiometric titration method using 0 1 hci khous et al 2021 therefore the concentration of silica sio2 was estimated by a colorimetric method khous et al 2019 the ionic balance is represented by a percentage about of 5 calculated from the equation b a l a n c e c a t i o n s a n i o n s c a t i o n s a n i o n s 100 to determine the mixing processes with the shallow water two samples were taken from the cold water of the bouhanifia region cold bnf and for saida cold water cold sa data is taken from bentabet et al 2019 the calculation of cationic and silica geothermometers was made by the aquachem software from waterloo hydrogeologic license moreover the mapping of geological and geographical cards was done with arcgis software 4 results and discussion the physicochemical analyses of water are represented in table 1 it is observed that the water is characterized by natural ph ranging from 5 86 to 7 03 bouhanifia samples showed significantly higher alkalinity relative to hco3 concentrations than saida samples the discharge temperature varies and oscillates between 26 and 65 c bnf5 marks the highest discharge temperature and the lowest value was measured in sa07 the hot spring sa02 is the most charged sample with an electrical conductivity value of 3620 μs cm while sa 05 is the least charged with 2000 μs cm we notice that the sample bnf4 represents a high value of no3 than other samples which confirms the presence of agricultural pollution compared to the no3 values of the cold water sample we deduce that this contamination is probably due to the intensive agricultural activity of alluvial ghriss plain close to bouhanifia geothermal area 4 1 hydrochemical parameters the chemical facies of the thermal water is indispensable to the knowledge of the geothermal proprieties and the external pollution for resource management therefore to identify the chemical elements that govern the mineralization of water and the mixing processes belhai et al 2022 benamar et al 2021 bouaicha et al 2017 strelbitskaya 2005 the chemical facies and the geochemical behavior of our geothermal water were determined according to the analysis of piper scholler and the cl so4 2 hco3 ternary diagrams according to the piper diagram fig 4 a there are two groups of chemical facies the main type of bouhanifia water is cl na ca2 furthermore saida geothermal water is characterized by cl so4 2 mg2 water type highlighting the cation s domination in the water therefore considering the host rock as jurassic dolomite and limestone it can be seen the strong possibility of mixing with the cold water the difference between the chemical facies of saida and bouhanifia in accordance with the high concentrations of so4 2 in saida water and the same recharge origin from posthumous accession of jurassic limestone of saida belhai et al 2020 thus is determined by the leaching from the upper jurassic formation of clay and sandstone deposits rich in so4 2 during the alimentation of saida mountains or after contact with shallow water rich in so4 2 djidi 2015 khiati et al 2021 the north geothermal water of algeria is characterized by na and cl salinity this na cl facies signature is explained by the strong interaction water rock in high temperatures which favorites the precipitation and dissolution of minerals from saline and evaporated formations during the geothermal flow path processes bahri et al 2011 belhai et al 2014 2016 saibi 2015 the cl so4 2 hco3 ternary diagram giggenbach 1991 describes the classification and origin of geothermal water between mature peripheral volcanic and steam heated water and indicates the origin and the chemical interaction of water during the hydrogeodynamic processes bouaicha et al 2019 kouadra et al 2019 the bouhanifia samples are positioned in hco3 peripheral and cl mature water zones fig 4b reported probably of the strong mixing with cold water from carbonated and saline formations rich in hco3 and cl jilali et al 2018 thus the bouhanifia samples are more influenced by carbonated formations filled in hco3 than saida samples the mainly of saida samples are located in cl mature waters which explains the influence of water by triassic formations rich in halite the so4 2 volcanic position of sa01 and 02 is likely explained by the contact with the eruption of magmatic formations in saida mountains the uplifting of these formations flowing through the large fault zones affects probably the chemical composition of recharge water before the infiltration the diagram of scholler was executed to specify the chemical facies and the mixing processes with the cold water during the circulation in deep shah et al 2021 strelbitskaya 2005 the identification of the mixture with cold water is by the vertical exchange of the analysis line with keeping the same form dauda and abba garba 2015 fig 5 a and b confirm the na cl chemical facies of the studied water the samples cold bnf and cold sa were used as references to identify the mixing from bouhanifia and saida regions respectively the cold water of bouhanifia presents higher concentrations of mg2 than all the samples of thermal waters while cold sa shows higher concentrations of hco3 and mg2 than almost all geothermal samples except for sa01 which explains that bouhanifia and saida waters are mainly influenced by the mixing with cold water strelbitskaya 2005 4 2 geothermal properties 4 2 1 chemical geothermometers in hydrothermal systems it is possible to evaluate the temperature of the water in the reservoir the method used to analyze the chemical parameters of the water is called geothermometry solute geothermometers in the hydrogeology domain are based on the equilibria between water mineral that make available to estimate the last temperatures of water rock interaction in the hydrothermal reservoirs das et al 2021 debonne 2015 yasin and kargın 2021 the application of geothermometers to determine the temperature reservoir depends on ion exchange between the active minerals and water belhai et al 2015 4 2 1 1 silica geothermometers in this study silica geothermometers chalcedony quartz maximum steam loss quartz no steam loss and α cristobalite were used to calculate the temperature of the geothermal reservoir table 2 silica geothermometers are best used to determine the estimated underground temperatures the calculations depend on the silica content mg l from the solubility of the chalcedony cristobalite and quartz in water dávalos elizondo et al 2021 debonne 2015 the silica geothermometers continually predict low temperatures ranging between 12 and 106 c fig 6 the lowest value is observed in sa08 while the highest temperature is detected in sample sa02 in contrast cristobalite and chalcedony geothermometers may not be reliable for our geothermal systems they give a temperature reservoir lower than the measured temperature of the hot springs at the surface table 2 therefore explained by the no saturation of water with chalcedony and cristobalite minerals accordingly to the mixing of the geothermal water rich in silica with cold superficial water belhai et al 2020 morales arredondo et al 2018 or and the amorphous silica may control the solubility of water on other hand geothermal water is likely close to equilibrium with crystal silica quartz mainly from glass volcanic origin karingithi 2009 probably related to the contact with volcanic eruptive formations mainly outcropping in sidi ammar summit during the recharge from saida mountains or else from the leaching of precambrian metamorphic formations of shale and primary quartz silica adiabatic and conductive geothermometers are very useful in the case of boiling and sub boiling springs respectively dávalos elizondo et al 2021 karingithi 2009 they give nearly values of estimated temperatures and higher than the field measured temperatures according to the surface measured temperatures which correspond to the sub boiling case the obtained values from quartz conductive geothermometer may be suitable for the studied geothermal water 4 2 1 2 cation geothermometers in the present work cation geothermometers na k ca2 na k and k mg2 were applied table 3 the estimated temperatures for each geothermometer were calculated using the appropriate equations the cation geothermometers are based on the ion exchange of cationic elements in reservoirs of high temperature yasin and kargın 2021 cationic geothermometers are more applicable in geothermal waters with a high salinity of dissolved chlorides and calcium in addition thermal waters are mainly affected by mixing with shallow water and equilibrium or no equilibrium with active minerals containing cationic elements karingithi 2009 pasvanoğlu 2020 garcía lópez et al 2014 the various estimated temperatures from the cationic geothermometers are shown in fig 7 considering silica quartz geothermometers results are higher than the na k fournier 1979 estimated temperatures therefore the others different na k geothermometers predict temperature values superior to na k ca2 values along with the silica geothermometers alpha cristobalite and chalcedony conductive the na k geothermometers of arnorsson et al 1982 tonani 1980 truesdell 1976 and nieva and nieva 1987 indicate the highest reservoirs temperatures of about 120 208 c 151 236 c 121 231 c and 110 229 c respectively while tonani 1980 in bnf2 and bnf3 samples obtain the maximum result 236 c six cationic geothermometers models provide similar results and their values are near to each other thus the estimated temperature values of na k fournier 1979 geothermometers are lower than other geothermometers these na k geothermometers values are relative to na k ratio while the na k ratio is 15 in all saida samples which demonstrates the fast accession of saida water to the surface therefore na k ratio 15 in bouhanifia samples reflects mixing with shallow waters from miocene saline formations rich in na belhai et al 2016 the na k ca2 geothermometer gives lower values than na k geothermometers especially for saida samples is probably due to the high concentration of mg2 in saida water moreover may to the equilibrium between na k feldspars mineral or the conversion of the calcium alumino silicate minerals to calcite belhai et al 2016 karingithi 2009 the mg2 corrector of na k ca2 geothermometers r fournier and potter 1979 is applied in the case of sub boiling springs with reservoir temperature 100 c and water with high mg2 concentrations gómez díaz and marin cerón 2018 karingithi 2009 the r values obtained from mg2 mg2 k ca2 100 are 50 signifying that the mg2 correction is not applicable in our case of study and the ca2 and k concentrations are not principally influenced by cooling conditions belhai et al 2016 the comparison between the silica and cationic geothermometers results confirms the cation domination behavior of our geothermal water thus the na k ca2 geothermometer seems more appropriate for bouhanifia samples according to the geothermal gradient 4 29 c 100 m and reservoir deep 1500 m in this region benamar et al 2021 bouchareb haouchine 2012 furthermore saida geothermal water is more compatible with quartz conductive geothermometer considering to geothermal gradient 3 25 c 100 m bouchareb haouchine 2012 in order to confirm the geothermometry results and better understand the equilibrium phases of water with particular cations and the different chemical exchanges in high temperatures several plots were exhibited and interpreted in the sections below 4 2 2 the geo indicators parameters the sio2 log k2 mg is used as geo indicator to identify the reservoir temperature gradient in low thermal conditions fig 8 the cross plot depends on chalcedony geothermometers which is more precise than quartz geothermometers in geothermal waters under low temperatures gómez díaz and marin cerón 2018 almost all saida samples are under 60 c in chalcedony conductive estimation thus bouhanifia samples are ranging between 70 and 76 c and the highest temperature attributed to sa02 is about 76 c these results might indicate that the water is classified as a low enthalpy category najar et al 2022 moreover deny the possibility that the solubility of water is controlled by amorphous silica the k2 mg vs k2 ca graphs in conjunction with the co2 evaluation xkmc plot of giggenbach and goguel 1989 is a useful diagram and geoindicator to specify the partial pressure of co2 on the water rock equilibrium temperature belhai et al 2022 shah et al 2019 bouhanifia samples bnf1 2 3 4 and 5 are positioned under the equilibrium line with higher co2 pressure of 0 01 and temperature ranging between 60 and 80 c fig 9 these conditions justify the high value of na k geothermometers because the dissolution of ca2 al silicate to calcite belhai et al 2020 shah et al 2021b hence illustrating hydrothermal alteration with formation rich in calcite probably from carbonated formations of the cretaceous the samples plotted above the equilibrium line saida samples showed a temperature of less than 60 c and low partial pressure of co2 therefore the partial pressure is lower to acquire the calcite dissolution and saida water is mainly affected by isothermal warming debonne 2015 4 2 3 equilibrium phases in this case the na k mg2 ternary diagram giggenbach 1988 is applied to determine the interaction between rock and water at high temperature as well as the state of this geothermal water in equilibrium phases neupane et al 2015 our thermal samples are positioned in mg2 immature waters part under the stable equilibrium pole fig 10 and thus close to limestone high temperature interaction consequently bouhanifia and saida geothermal water is mainly affected by dissolution and precipitation more than equilibrium additionally the thermal water is mixed with cold water rich in mg2 which influences the water temperature during underground circulation in consequence the application of immature waters in the estimated temperature from the cationic geothermometers in some cases must be less credible and cautious belhai et al 2020 the 10 k 10 k na versus 10mg2 10mg2 ca2 diagram giggenbach 1988 show that hot springs are above the equilibrium line fig 11 closer to seawater is maybe to the mixing with saline cold water during the accession these results deny the correlation of thermal water with na k geothermometers chatterjee et al 2017 and confirm the no application of these geothermometers in our case of study 4 2 4 mixing model the identification of the mixing processes for bouhanifia and saida water is an important tool for the management of the resource the results from the scholler plot above have defined the possibility of mixing with cold water to this purpose silica mixing model was applied to determine the temperature of the geothermal water in the mixing phase as well as the reservoir temperature chatterjee et al 2017 kouadra et al 2019 the silica enthalpy model was developed by fournier and truesdell 1974 truesdell and fournier 1977 is a graphical plot that permits to deduce the temperature of the geothermal reservoir and the mixing rate of silica in high temperature conditions fig 12 this plot represents the concentrations of silica on mg l versus the enthalpy of hot springs discharge temperatures the enthalpy values were determined from the steam tables of thermodynamic data for water at vapor pressures and temperatures keenan et al 1969 the application of the silica mixing model is based on assumptions that no conductive cooling and no silica dissolution or disposition were taken place after mixing in addition the solubility of silica depends on quartz belhai et al 2020 2022 bouaicha et al 2019 chatterjee et al 2017 kouadra et al 2019 the sample of cold water was used from belhai et al 2016 data as the meteoric water samples of northwestern algeria with 15 c of temperature and 10 mg l concentration of silica the linking of cold water to geothermal water samples if we consider the steam loss before mixing boiling conditions 100 c and 419 kj kg gives the points a b c and d the projection of these points to the maximum steam loss line quartz solubility line allows the estimation of reservoir temperature from the enthalpy values of the point a for sa03 b for samples bnf1 2 3 and sa02 09 moreover c for bnf4 sa07 04 and d for bnf5 sa05 06 01 and 08 belhai et al 2022 therefore the vertical relying upon a b c to no steam loss line shows the silica concentration on reservoir temperatures represented by a b c the fraction of hot water depends in the temperature and silica component of discharge hot spring khiati et al 2021 calculated from x 1 sio2 at a b c sio2 at a b c the results of the estimated temperature reservoir and the silica ratio of the thermal waters are represented in table 4 accordingly the estimated temperature determined from the silica enthalpy model is higher compared to the results of silica geothermometers hence these obtained values are likely justified by silicate precipitation according to mixing or cooling with cold water belhai et al 2014 5 conclusion the characterization of thermal water is an approach that depends on several parameters in our case hydrochemistry and geothermometry were used to determine the geochemical facies the mixing processes and the geothermal aptitudes therefore to obtain the following conclusions the geochemical facies of bouhanifia water is cl na ca2 while cl so4 2 mg2 is the type of saida geothermal water thus the studied geothermal water is mixed with cold water mainly from saline formations and carbonated aquifers in addition the possibility of the existence of external agricultural pollution especially in the samples bnf4 geothermal water is considered immature waters which is more affected by precipitation and dissolution than equilibrium in a high temperature therefore the silica geothermometers seem more compatible in our case study than cationic geothermometers the results obtained by silica geothermometers oscillate between 12 and 106 c moreover the values vary between 51 and 236 c by using cationic geothermometers therefore the quartz conductive geothermometer is more appropriate for saida geothermal water on the other hand na k ca2 geothermometer values are likely suitable for bouhanifia water according to discharge temperatures and the geothermal gradient in the region 4 29 c 100 m most of the last studies are focused on the regional scale of north western algeria accordingly our work is based on the local perspectives while bouhanifia and saida water is mainly influenced by local geology and tectonic therefore explained by the interactions with miocene and cretaceous aquifers leaching from saline triassic formations agricultural pollution from the alluvial plain of ghriss and the contact with the cold groundwater of chott ech chergui formations or the sabkhas water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11708,the paper aims to determine the geothermal characteristics and the mixing possibility of bouhanifia and saida geothermal resource because of its importance in tourist activities and energy investigations by using geothermometry and geochemical approaches the methodology of our work is based on physico chemical analysis and thus is validated by the execution of plots and graphs that identify the mixing with cold water and define the geothermal behavior geothermal water is characterized by natural ph ranging between 5 86 and 7 03 furthermore by cation domination water type cl na ca for bouhanifia and cl so4 2 mg2 for saida the silica geothermometers give lower temperatures variation between 12 and 106 c on the other hand the estimated temperature from cationic geothermometers ranges between 51 and 236 c the geothermal is mixed with cold water from saline and carbonated formations results showed that the studied geothermal water chemistry and geothermometry are more affected by local geology and tectonic than regional perspectives therefore the water is influenced by polluted shallow interactions and is classified as a low enthalpy category graphical abstract image 1 keywords geothermometry mixing models geochemical proprieties geothermal aptitudes northwestern algerian data availability the used data is included in the text 1 introduction water management is a global challenge in the current climate situation especially when it comes to an area susceptible to external pollution the bouhanifia and saida waters are characterized by high salinity in their geochemical composition bahri et al 2011 belhai et al 2016 2022 2020 benamar et al 2021 djidi et al 2008 khiati et al 2021 saibi 2009 2015 which is relative to the deep circulation of water through various geological formations belhai et al 2016 benamar et al 2021 khiati et al 2021 the region is defined by recent active tectonic which affected the position of some hot springs and their geochemical composition ayadi et al 2002 benamar et al 2021 in addition the complex local geology is mainly observed by the difference of facies between bouhanifia and saida areas according to the large faults network of ne sw orientations aïfa et al 2003 bouyahiaoui et al 2017 dalloni 1926 khiati et al 2021 yelles chaouche et al 2006 however in the local context the regions especially the bouhanifia area remain understudied bouhanifia and saida area belong to the north african thermal system exactly in the northwest of algeria fig 1 a they appertain to mascara state algerian administrative city and saida state respectively fig 1 b the regions of bouhanifia geothermal area and saida area located at 230 m and 500 1150 m respectively are a part of the oranian tell it is surrounded by benichougran mountains in the northeast with 800 m of altitude and by the saida karstic mountains 1200 m in the southeast the 80 km long ghriss rural plain is located between the bouhanifia and saida geothermal fields the climate is semi arid with annual average temperatures of 18 c and 16 85 c for bouhanifia and saida respectively belhai et al 2014 chentout et al 2015 djidi et al 2008 gliz et al 2015 lakrout et al 2022 anteur et al 2015 therefore geothermal water is characterized by natural ph and discharge temperatures oscillate between 26 and 65 c our methodology depends on field investigations as well as laboratory and simulation works thus the elaboration of the physico chemical analysis and the execution of graphs and plots help to understand the geothermal behavior of water belhai et al 2022 bouaicha et al 2019 hamed et al 2011 kouadra et al 2019 madrid and zayas 2007 shah et al 2019 2021b strelbitskaya 2005 this work has the objective to define the influence of the local geology and tectonic moreover the mixing possibilities in water hydrochemistry and geothermometry separately from the regional characterizations of our study area for this reason and in order to the management of the geothermal resource the application of the mixing model geo indicator graphs and hydrochemical plots is useful to identify the eventual pollution sources the geological origins and the water potential belhai et al 2016 benmarce et al 2021 bouaicha et al 2017 bouselsal and saibi 2022 chatterjee et al 2017 kouadra et al 2019 khous et al 2019 2021 shah et al 2019 2021 strelbitskaya 2005 as well as the estimated temperatures of the reservoir by the application of silica and cationic geothermometers to determine the geothermal properties insight the ion exchange and silica content of water in high temperature conditions das et al 2021 debonne 2015 yasin and kargın 2021 dávalos elizondo et al 2021 karingithi 2009 morales arredondo et al 2018 pasvanoğlu 2020 2 geology and tectonic of the study area 2 1 geology of bouhanifia the geological and tectonic framework is essential to understanding the geothermal properties of our studied thermal water our region belongs to the surrounding maghrebines alpine fold belts saibi 2009 according to the local geological card of mascara dalloni 1926 the main dominant formations are eocene aged of marl and limestone fig 2 and outcropping has overlain the position of the hot springs discharge the quaternary is represented as a superficial aquifer around mascara by alluvial and travertine formations chentout et al 2015 therefore the miocene formations are characterized by marine facies known in the upper miocene tortonian formations by sandstone sand and marl in addition to altered marl and sand in the middle miocene helvetian formations of pounding and sandstone and the lower miocene by aquitaine sedimentary formations of altered silt with sandstone and pounding benamar et al 2021 the cretaceous aquifer is defined by carbonated formations of sandstone and marl mainly developed in the benichougran mountains with around 200 m of thickness moreover is considered at the top of the geothermal reservoir of dolomite and limestone formations of jurassic with more than 1500 m of thickness benamar et al 2021 the hydrogeological substratum of our thermal area is outcropping in the northeast of bouhanifia by the triassic formation of halite gypsum and anhydrite 2 2 geology of saida the saida region is mainly constituted by mesozoic and tertiary sediments while the carbonated formations of jurassic outcropping in the saida mountains represent 40 of the area hence defined as a regional aquifer of saida and bouhanifia water djidi et al 2008 the quaternary is composed of old and recent alluvial silt and conglomerate mainly developed around saida city and saida mountains fig 3 the miocene in saida region is known for its continental layer of conglomerate and sandstone successive by cretaceous formations of white limestone with 100 m of thickness khiati et al 2021 the large anticlinal of saida mountains is defined by lower middle jurassic of dolomite limestone and marl in addition saida clay and sandstone formations are attributed to upper jurassic callovo oxfordian about 300 m of thickness bentabet et al 2019 therefore the trias is manifested north of saida mainly constituted by evaporated formations of gypsum and halite the paleozoic basement is observed in the east of the hot spring sa02 sidi ammar summit outcropping by metamorphic formations of shale and primary quartz dahmani 2016 the geothermal area is limited in the south by chott ech chergui fig 3 which is a submerged zone known by sabkhas the cold and the thermal waters of this area are characterized by high salinity in their geochemical composition aoudia et al 2020 2 3 structural analysis the recent tectonic of the region is characterized by a series of trust sheet and echelons folds within ene wsw orientation and large faults network mainly created in mio plio quaternary periods during the movement of african and iberian plats belhai et al 2016 the alluvial formations are deposed abnormally on eocene formations in the thermal spring discharge zone is likely justified by the influence of hussein earthquake which affects the position of the hot springs ayadi et al 2002 3 methodology of sampling and analysis the execution of cationic and silica geothermometers to determine the estimated temperatures of the water in the reservoir depends on the physico chemical analysis in our case of study the chemical analysis of water was operated from 14 samples of bouhanifia and saida hot springs the sampling was effectuated in october 2018 with 5 samples from the bouhanifia area labeled bnf and 9 of saida water labeled sa from a homogeneous representation of water with the use of appropriate means and materials new and sterile borosilicate glass bottles the temperature ph and electrical conductivity were measured in situ with multi parameter hanna instruments hi9828 ph orp ec do after filtration samples were conserved at 4 c in a dark environment until transported to the laboratory madrid and zayas 2007 the cations na ca2 mg2 k li and anions hco3 no3 cl f br so4 2 were determined with the application of the performance ion liquid chromatography method hpilc dionex dx120 the validation for precision sensitivity and linearity was applied by using mixture solutions dionex cation standard for cations from which four dilutions were performed and filtered through a 0 45 μm filter the anion mixed standard solution were used for anions after the application of 3 dilutions sellam 2012 the accuracy was deduced by limit of detection lod relative to anions about of 0 25 0 54 1 23 and 1 07 ppm for f cl no3 and so4 2 respectively furthermore of cations about of 0 41 0 73 0 74 0 08 and 5 12 ppm for na mg2 k li and ca2 respectively dawood and sanad 2014 fa et al 2018 the total alkalinity hco3 was measured by the potentiometric titration method using 0 1 hci khous et al 2021 therefore the concentration of silica sio2 was estimated by a colorimetric method khous et al 2019 the ionic balance is represented by a percentage about of 5 calculated from the equation b a l a n c e c a t i o n s a n i o n s c a t i o n s a n i o n s 100 to determine the mixing processes with the shallow water two samples were taken from the cold water of the bouhanifia region cold bnf and for saida cold water cold sa data is taken from bentabet et al 2019 the calculation of cationic and silica geothermometers was made by the aquachem software from waterloo hydrogeologic license moreover the mapping of geological and geographical cards was done with arcgis software 4 results and discussion the physicochemical analyses of water are represented in table 1 it is observed that the water is characterized by natural ph ranging from 5 86 to 7 03 bouhanifia samples showed significantly higher alkalinity relative to hco3 concentrations than saida samples the discharge temperature varies and oscillates between 26 and 65 c bnf5 marks the highest discharge temperature and the lowest value was measured in sa07 the hot spring sa02 is the most charged sample with an electrical conductivity value of 3620 μs cm while sa 05 is the least charged with 2000 μs cm we notice that the sample bnf4 represents a high value of no3 than other samples which confirms the presence of agricultural pollution compared to the no3 values of the cold water sample we deduce that this contamination is probably due to the intensive agricultural activity of alluvial ghriss plain close to bouhanifia geothermal area 4 1 hydrochemical parameters the chemical facies of the thermal water is indispensable to the knowledge of the geothermal proprieties and the external pollution for resource management therefore to identify the chemical elements that govern the mineralization of water and the mixing processes belhai et al 2022 benamar et al 2021 bouaicha et al 2017 strelbitskaya 2005 the chemical facies and the geochemical behavior of our geothermal water were determined according to the analysis of piper scholler and the cl so4 2 hco3 ternary diagrams according to the piper diagram fig 4 a there are two groups of chemical facies the main type of bouhanifia water is cl na ca2 furthermore saida geothermal water is characterized by cl so4 2 mg2 water type highlighting the cation s domination in the water therefore considering the host rock as jurassic dolomite and limestone it can be seen the strong possibility of mixing with the cold water the difference between the chemical facies of saida and bouhanifia in accordance with the high concentrations of so4 2 in saida water and the same recharge origin from posthumous accession of jurassic limestone of saida belhai et al 2020 thus is determined by the leaching from the upper jurassic formation of clay and sandstone deposits rich in so4 2 during the alimentation of saida mountains or after contact with shallow water rich in so4 2 djidi 2015 khiati et al 2021 the north geothermal water of algeria is characterized by na and cl salinity this na cl facies signature is explained by the strong interaction water rock in high temperatures which favorites the precipitation and dissolution of minerals from saline and evaporated formations during the geothermal flow path processes bahri et al 2011 belhai et al 2014 2016 saibi 2015 the cl so4 2 hco3 ternary diagram giggenbach 1991 describes the classification and origin of geothermal water between mature peripheral volcanic and steam heated water and indicates the origin and the chemical interaction of water during the hydrogeodynamic processes bouaicha et al 2019 kouadra et al 2019 the bouhanifia samples are positioned in hco3 peripheral and cl mature water zones fig 4b reported probably of the strong mixing with cold water from carbonated and saline formations rich in hco3 and cl jilali et al 2018 thus the bouhanifia samples are more influenced by carbonated formations filled in hco3 than saida samples the mainly of saida samples are located in cl mature waters which explains the influence of water by triassic formations rich in halite the so4 2 volcanic position of sa01 and 02 is likely explained by the contact with the eruption of magmatic formations in saida mountains the uplifting of these formations flowing through the large fault zones affects probably the chemical composition of recharge water before the infiltration the diagram of scholler was executed to specify the chemical facies and the mixing processes with the cold water during the circulation in deep shah et al 2021 strelbitskaya 2005 the identification of the mixture with cold water is by the vertical exchange of the analysis line with keeping the same form dauda and abba garba 2015 fig 5 a and b confirm the na cl chemical facies of the studied water the samples cold bnf and cold sa were used as references to identify the mixing from bouhanifia and saida regions respectively the cold water of bouhanifia presents higher concentrations of mg2 than all the samples of thermal waters while cold sa shows higher concentrations of hco3 and mg2 than almost all geothermal samples except for sa01 which explains that bouhanifia and saida waters are mainly influenced by the mixing with cold water strelbitskaya 2005 4 2 geothermal properties 4 2 1 chemical geothermometers in hydrothermal systems it is possible to evaluate the temperature of the water in the reservoir the method used to analyze the chemical parameters of the water is called geothermometry solute geothermometers in the hydrogeology domain are based on the equilibria between water mineral that make available to estimate the last temperatures of water rock interaction in the hydrothermal reservoirs das et al 2021 debonne 2015 yasin and kargın 2021 the application of geothermometers to determine the temperature reservoir depends on ion exchange between the active minerals and water belhai et al 2015 4 2 1 1 silica geothermometers in this study silica geothermometers chalcedony quartz maximum steam loss quartz no steam loss and α cristobalite were used to calculate the temperature of the geothermal reservoir table 2 silica geothermometers are best used to determine the estimated underground temperatures the calculations depend on the silica content mg l from the solubility of the chalcedony cristobalite and quartz in water dávalos elizondo et al 2021 debonne 2015 the silica geothermometers continually predict low temperatures ranging between 12 and 106 c fig 6 the lowest value is observed in sa08 while the highest temperature is detected in sample sa02 in contrast cristobalite and chalcedony geothermometers may not be reliable for our geothermal systems they give a temperature reservoir lower than the measured temperature of the hot springs at the surface table 2 therefore explained by the no saturation of water with chalcedony and cristobalite minerals accordingly to the mixing of the geothermal water rich in silica with cold superficial water belhai et al 2020 morales arredondo et al 2018 or and the amorphous silica may control the solubility of water on other hand geothermal water is likely close to equilibrium with crystal silica quartz mainly from glass volcanic origin karingithi 2009 probably related to the contact with volcanic eruptive formations mainly outcropping in sidi ammar summit during the recharge from saida mountains or else from the leaching of precambrian metamorphic formations of shale and primary quartz silica adiabatic and conductive geothermometers are very useful in the case of boiling and sub boiling springs respectively dávalos elizondo et al 2021 karingithi 2009 they give nearly values of estimated temperatures and higher than the field measured temperatures according to the surface measured temperatures which correspond to the sub boiling case the obtained values from quartz conductive geothermometer may be suitable for the studied geothermal water 4 2 1 2 cation geothermometers in the present work cation geothermometers na k ca2 na k and k mg2 were applied table 3 the estimated temperatures for each geothermometer were calculated using the appropriate equations the cation geothermometers are based on the ion exchange of cationic elements in reservoirs of high temperature yasin and kargın 2021 cationic geothermometers are more applicable in geothermal waters with a high salinity of dissolved chlorides and calcium in addition thermal waters are mainly affected by mixing with shallow water and equilibrium or no equilibrium with active minerals containing cationic elements karingithi 2009 pasvanoğlu 2020 garcía lópez et al 2014 the various estimated temperatures from the cationic geothermometers are shown in fig 7 considering silica quartz geothermometers results are higher than the na k fournier 1979 estimated temperatures therefore the others different na k geothermometers predict temperature values superior to na k ca2 values along with the silica geothermometers alpha cristobalite and chalcedony conductive the na k geothermometers of arnorsson et al 1982 tonani 1980 truesdell 1976 and nieva and nieva 1987 indicate the highest reservoirs temperatures of about 120 208 c 151 236 c 121 231 c and 110 229 c respectively while tonani 1980 in bnf2 and bnf3 samples obtain the maximum result 236 c six cationic geothermometers models provide similar results and their values are near to each other thus the estimated temperature values of na k fournier 1979 geothermometers are lower than other geothermometers these na k geothermometers values are relative to na k ratio while the na k ratio is 15 in all saida samples which demonstrates the fast accession of saida water to the surface therefore na k ratio 15 in bouhanifia samples reflects mixing with shallow waters from miocene saline formations rich in na belhai et al 2016 the na k ca2 geothermometer gives lower values than na k geothermometers especially for saida samples is probably due to the high concentration of mg2 in saida water moreover may to the equilibrium between na k feldspars mineral or the conversion of the calcium alumino silicate minerals to calcite belhai et al 2016 karingithi 2009 the mg2 corrector of na k ca2 geothermometers r fournier and potter 1979 is applied in the case of sub boiling springs with reservoir temperature 100 c and water with high mg2 concentrations gómez díaz and marin cerón 2018 karingithi 2009 the r values obtained from mg2 mg2 k ca2 100 are 50 signifying that the mg2 correction is not applicable in our case of study and the ca2 and k concentrations are not principally influenced by cooling conditions belhai et al 2016 the comparison between the silica and cationic geothermometers results confirms the cation domination behavior of our geothermal water thus the na k ca2 geothermometer seems more appropriate for bouhanifia samples according to the geothermal gradient 4 29 c 100 m and reservoir deep 1500 m in this region benamar et al 2021 bouchareb haouchine 2012 furthermore saida geothermal water is more compatible with quartz conductive geothermometer considering to geothermal gradient 3 25 c 100 m bouchareb haouchine 2012 in order to confirm the geothermometry results and better understand the equilibrium phases of water with particular cations and the different chemical exchanges in high temperatures several plots were exhibited and interpreted in the sections below 4 2 2 the geo indicators parameters the sio2 log k2 mg is used as geo indicator to identify the reservoir temperature gradient in low thermal conditions fig 8 the cross plot depends on chalcedony geothermometers which is more precise than quartz geothermometers in geothermal waters under low temperatures gómez díaz and marin cerón 2018 almost all saida samples are under 60 c in chalcedony conductive estimation thus bouhanifia samples are ranging between 70 and 76 c and the highest temperature attributed to sa02 is about 76 c these results might indicate that the water is classified as a low enthalpy category najar et al 2022 moreover deny the possibility that the solubility of water is controlled by amorphous silica the k2 mg vs k2 ca graphs in conjunction with the co2 evaluation xkmc plot of giggenbach and goguel 1989 is a useful diagram and geoindicator to specify the partial pressure of co2 on the water rock equilibrium temperature belhai et al 2022 shah et al 2019 bouhanifia samples bnf1 2 3 4 and 5 are positioned under the equilibrium line with higher co2 pressure of 0 01 and temperature ranging between 60 and 80 c fig 9 these conditions justify the high value of na k geothermometers because the dissolution of ca2 al silicate to calcite belhai et al 2020 shah et al 2021b hence illustrating hydrothermal alteration with formation rich in calcite probably from carbonated formations of the cretaceous the samples plotted above the equilibrium line saida samples showed a temperature of less than 60 c and low partial pressure of co2 therefore the partial pressure is lower to acquire the calcite dissolution and saida water is mainly affected by isothermal warming debonne 2015 4 2 3 equilibrium phases in this case the na k mg2 ternary diagram giggenbach 1988 is applied to determine the interaction between rock and water at high temperature as well as the state of this geothermal water in equilibrium phases neupane et al 2015 our thermal samples are positioned in mg2 immature waters part under the stable equilibrium pole fig 10 and thus close to limestone high temperature interaction consequently bouhanifia and saida geothermal water is mainly affected by dissolution and precipitation more than equilibrium additionally the thermal water is mixed with cold water rich in mg2 which influences the water temperature during underground circulation in consequence the application of immature waters in the estimated temperature from the cationic geothermometers in some cases must be less credible and cautious belhai et al 2020 the 10 k 10 k na versus 10mg2 10mg2 ca2 diagram giggenbach 1988 show that hot springs are above the equilibrium line fig 11 closer to seawater is maybe to the mixing with saline cold water during the accession these results deny the correlation of thermal water with na k geothermometers chatterjee et al 2017 and confirm the no application of these geothermometers in our case of study 4 2 4 mixing model the identification of the mixing processes for bouhanifia and saida water is an important tool for the management of the resource the results from the scholler plot above have defined the possibility of mixing with cold water to this purpose silica mixing model was applied to determine the temperature of the geothermal water in the mixing phase as well as the reservoir temperature chatterjee et al 2017 kouadra et al 2019 the silica enthalpy model was developed by fournier and truesdell 1974 truesdell and fournier 1977 is a graphical plot that permits to deduce the temperature of the geothermal reservoir and the mixing rate of silica in high temperature conditions fig 12 this plot represents the concentrations of silica on mg l versus the enthalpy of hot springs discharge temperatures the enthalpy values were determined from the steam tables of thermodynamic data for water at vapor pressures and temperatures keenan et al 1969 the application of the silica mixing model is based on assumptions that no conductive cooling and no silica dissolution or disposition were taken place after mixing in addition the solubility of silica depends on quartz belhai et al 2020 2022 bouaicha et al 2019 chatterjee et al 2017 kouadra et al 2019 the sample of cold water was used from belhai et al 2016 data as the meteoric water samples of northwestern algeria with 15 c of temperature and 10 mg l concentration of silica the linking of cold water to geothermal water samples if we consider the steam loss before mixing boiling conditions 100 c and 419 kj kg gives the points a b c and d the projection of these points to the maximum steam loss line quartz solubility line allows the estimation of reservoir temperature from the enthalpy values of the point a for sa03 b for samples bnf1 2 3 and sa02 09 moreover c for bnf4 sa07 04 and d for bnf5 sa05 06 01 and 08 belhai et al 2022 therefore the vertical relying upon a b c to no steam loss line shows the silica concentration on reservoir temperatures represented by a b c the fraction of hot water depends in the temperature and silica component of discharge hot spring khiati et al 2021 calculated from x 1 sio2 at a b c sio2 at a b c the results of the estimated temperature reservoir and the silica ratio of the thermal waters are represented in table 4 accordingly the estimated temperature determined from the silica enthalpy model is higher compared to the results of silica geothermometers hence these obtained values are likely justified by silicate precipitation according to mixing or cooling with cold water belhai et al 2014 5 conclusion the characterization of thermal water is an approach that depends on several parameters in our case hydrochemistry and geothermometry were used to determine the geochemical facies the mixing processes and the geothermal aptitudes therefore to obtain the following conclusions the geochemical facies of bouhanifia water is cl na ca2 while cl so4 2 mg2 is the type of saida geothermal water thus the studied geothermal water is mixed with cold water mainly from saline formations and carbonated aquifers in addition the possibility of the existence of external agricultural pollution especially in the samples bnf4 geothermal water is considered immature waters which is more affected by precipitation and dissolution than equilibrium in a high temperature therefore the silica geothermometers seem more compatible in our case study than cationic geothermometers the results obtained by silica geothermometers oscillate between 12 and 106 c moreover the values vary between 51 and 236 c by using cationic geothermometers therefore the quartz conductive geothermometer is more appropriate for saida geothermal water on the other hand na k ca2 geothermometer values are likely suitable for bouhanifia water according to discharge temperatures and the geothermal gradient in the region 4 29 c 100 m most of the last studies are focused on the regional scale of north western algeria accordingly our work is based on the local perspectives while bouhanifia and saida water is mainly influenced by local geology and tectonic therefore explained by the interactions with miocene and cretaceous aquifers leaching from saline triassic formations agricultural pollution from the alluvial plain of ghriss and the contact with the cold groundwater of chott ech chergui formations or the sabkhas water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

absorption bands corresponding to frequencies and vibrations specific to organic or inorganic substances doğan et al 2007 especially for organic substances wavelengths greater than 2000 cm 1 are more decisive in the study the samples obtained before and after tc removal with esw nzvi 2 45 ghz were made into a thin disk and analyzed and ftir spectra were obtained analysis results were interpreted by the vibration bands tc molecules and functional groups attached to the biosorbent surface the analysis of the structural properties of biocomposites and quantitative analysis of adsorption

effect on tc removal the ph value of experimental conditions plays a vital role on tc removing merck from wastewater ersan and dogan 2021 initial tc concentration and adsorbent amount determined respectively as 50 mg l and 10 g l reported that the other study ersan and dogan 2022 to evaluate the effect of ph on tc removal ph was varied between 3 and 8 and the efficiency of tc removal was investigated using 10 g l esw 20 c c0 50 mg l fig 2 a tc removal efficiency improved with increasing initial ph reaching a maximum value of 64 75 for esw at ph 5 the polyhydroxyl phenolic structure and carboxyl groups polyacrylamide amide groups and functional groups of tc contribute to the complicated hydrophilic interactions amongst biosorbent molecules the ionic form of tc and the biosorbent s surface charge are ph dependent tc exists in various forms which are somewhat similar for the nonpolar and zwitterionic neutral forms but quite different for the anion form tc assumes a twisted conformation in neutral to acid conditions with the dimethylamino group located above the ring system of the molecule the molecule is in the extended conformation in basic or water free solutions where the dimethylamino group is located below the ring system bağda et al 2013 the ph of the solution where adsorption occurs has a significant value on the amount of adsorption the adsorption of ions from solution ph values are influenced by the acidic or basic environment in which the adsorption occurs i e the strong adherence of h and oh ions to the surface various ions can be adsorbed at different ph values throughout the adsorption process cao et al 2018 the high tc removal efficiency 64 75 at ph 5 indicated a significant electrostatic attraction between tc and esw increasing adsorption capacity based on the data it is believed that the removal process is electrostatic primarily adsorption the zero point of charge phpzc was obtained in fig 2 b to investigate the effect of repulsion and pull forces on tc removal ph 2 10 was determined in solutions containing 50 mg tc l at various ph values for this purpose the phpzc value of the biosorbent was determined as 6 4 with the surface positively charged below this value this scenario may be explained by the diminishing removal efficiency of tc and the influential repulsive forces of the solution parvin et al 2019 the ph value of the composites under optimal circumstances was lower than the phpzc of the adsorbent indicating that their surface was positively charged the adsorption process might be acidic or basic depending on the presence of h and oh ions on the biosorbent surface the solution containing positively charged tc has a ph of 3 3 whereas the solution containing negatively charged tc has a ph of 7 7 between these values tc exhibits dipolar properties the removal of tc is found by complexation and cationic ion exchange and the ph 5 value was determined to be 64 7 which is consistent with the literature and consistent with the effect of electrostatic attraction forces ersan et al 2015 3 2 effect of biosorbent amount on tc removal different concentrations of biosorbents were investigated using 50 mg l tc solutions under adsorption settings ph 5 c0 50 ppm t 20 c 180 rpm and 2 h to determine the effects of adsorbent amount on tc removal processes the reason for working at a solution concentration of 50 mg l in this study is that the best removal efficiency was found at this concentration in the experiments performed in the 0 100 mg l concentration range the effects of biosorbent amount on tc removal efficiency and adsorption capacity qe mg g were investigated and the maximum removal efficiencies 50 g l adsorbent amount were compared according to the literature microwave treated magnetic waste pet bottles yield to a removal efficiency of 93 38 ersan and dogan 2021 whereas cfs800 led to a removal efficiency of 30 7 at the same adsorbent amount using pyrolyzed crayfish shell biochar a biological adsorbent zhang et al 2021 eggshells have the potential to be used as an adsorbent for the adsorptive removal of a variety of contaminants from both aqueous and non aqueous solutions with maximum adsorption capacities of 195 9 185 1 125 5 and 44 6 mgg 1 for sulfamethoxazole methyl orange diclofenac sodium and dibenzothiophene respectively shi et al 2020 some literature studies were given table 1 in the present study tc removal and qe values were calculated for esw esw nzvi and esw nzvi 2 45 ghz as 73 65 3 68 90 91 4 54 and 94 61 respectively esw nzvi 2 45 ghz was synthesized using emr with an increase on tc removal efficiency of about 17 26 and 3 7 respectively compared with esw and esw nzvi thereby obtaining greater tc binding surface thus it has been demonstrated that by modifying biological adsorbents with emr and nzvi the adsorption efficiency of biological adsorbents may be enhanced these results show that esw nzvi 2 45 ghz effectively adsorbent for tc and optimization studies for tc removal conditions constructed this biosorbent 3 3 box benkhen model output of design studies constructed using the tc yk nzvi response surface method rsm among the best findings obtained the experimental settings were modeled using the box benkhen approach design expert 11 trial version keeping ph constant at 5 and the esw nzvi 2 45 ghz concentration constant at 10 g l thus determining the optimal parameters for tc removal y in the model represents the tc removal efficiency the following independent variables and their ranges were used as input variables emr t 0 4 min co 10 100 mg l and temperature 20 50 c seventeen experiments were conducted within the scope of the study modeled based on box benkhen design and four were repeated for the central point tab 2 a quadratic equation was obtained according to the parameters impacting tc removal eq 16 16 y 89 00 1 00 a 15 12 b 0 38 c 1 75 a b 0 75 a c 1 00 b c 2 50 a 2 9 75 b 2 0 75 c 2 in order for the acquired findings to be statistically significant the probability value expressed as prob f must be less than 0 05 it is statistically insignificant for the response variables when the value exceeds 0 1000 examining r2 in conjunction with the f value is essential for determining its conformity with the anova predicted equation if the design does not fit the obtained data there is a lack of fit and the model is not suggested for use with the experimental system values of the r2 value that approach 1 indicate that there is not a significant difference between the method value and the actual value the method s f value was determined as 45 77 table 2 the method is compatible with the predicted f value with a probability value less than or equal to 0 0001 the r2 value of 0 9833 for the efficiency of tc removal demonstrates the method s accuracy while r2 adj 0 9618 and r2 pred 0 7327 are in excellent agreement if the method has many variables and the sample size is small r2 adj may be much smaller than r2 li et al 2010 it is well established that in rsm the error referred to as lack of fit is statistically negligible for the model but essential for the regression model topal and arslan topal 2020 adeq precision analyzes experimental data for determining the signal to noise ratio it is desired for the model s predicted values to have a ratio greater than four a signal to noise ratio of 12 92 suggests that the signal is adequate optimal conditions were discovered by tc removal studies using rsm experimental design emr time t was determined to 2 min the temperature was set to 20 and the initial tc concentration c0 was 50 mg l fig 3 a shows that the initial tc concentration and increasing emr time affected the tc adsorption it was discovered that increasing the temperature values boosted the efficiency of removal the effects of emr duration and initial tc concentration are combined it is clear that emr length highly affected the efficiency of tc removal at high initial tc concentration values b increasing emr time and temperature increased a quadratic effect on tc removal c increasing initial tc concentration values indicated that the second order effects of temperature on tc removal became prominent eq 16 in order to verify the test results obtained with rsm and to see the deviation from the experimental values the experiment was repeated under optimum conditions t 35 c emr mw time 2 min co 55 mg l with the removal efficiency calculated as 89 experimentally the highest tc removal efficiency was 94 61 at an optimum temperature of 20 c 2 min emr mw time and co 50 mg l experimental conditions some literature studies were given table 2 the results shown that synthesized adsorbent efficiently for tc removal 3 4 adsorption isotherms and characterization of adsorption the langmuir freundlich d r and temkin adsorption isotherms of the esw nzvi 2 45 ghz biosorbent exposed to 2 min 2 45 ghz emr were evaluated in the box benkhen design for tc removal fig 4 the qmax value for esw nzvi 2 45 ghz was determined to be 107 52 mg g demonstrating the adsorption s efficiency this explains why the heat of adsorption for all models decreases linearly with the area impacted by adsorbent adsorbent interactions on the biosorbent surface layer thus the potential direction of adsorbents for adsorbents is described by the findings from temkin isotherm model which implies a linear decrease in heat of adsorption the adsorption process is believed to involve chemical ion exchange with an e value much greater than 16 kj mol 354 kj mol table 2 panagitou et al 2018 guler and kundakci 2018 zhang et al 2011 3 5 determination of kinetic constants and thermodynamic parameters in tc adsorption the kinetic constants for the esw nzvi 2 45 ghz adsorption of tc ions were calculated using the pseudo first pseudo second and intraparticle models table 2 the elimination was determined to be appropriate for the pseudo second kinetic model with the highest r2 value 0 9999 the effect of contact time on the adsorption process was examined by working for 5 240 min for various contact periods c0 50 mg l t 120 min ph 5 it was observed that the adsorption capacity increased with increasing contact time the adsorption capacity increased with increasing contact time the calculated qe value deviated from the experimental value for the pseudo first order model in tc elimination when the experimental and theoretical qe values were compared they were found to be 4 76 mg g and 0 662 mg g respectively indicating a discrepancy however the correlation coefficient r2 of the pseudo second order kinetic model for tc adsorption was 0 9999 the qe calculated using the pseudo second order kinetic model was 4 76 mg g whereas the theoretical value was 4 79 mg g indicating that the model is suitable while linearity was not achieved to the same extent as previous models a reasonable degree of agreement was achieved with a r2 value of 0 9232 the adsorption of tc on esw nzvi 2 45 ghz is explained by a pseudo second order model by maintaining a constant concentration of biosorbent at 10 g l the effect of temperature on the adsorption process was investigated at various values 20 40 c the removal efficiency decreased with increasing temperature due to the attractive forces between the solute and the surface highest tc removal efficiency was calculated as 94 61 at 20 c the calculated gibbs free energy δg0 values were negative and remarkably close with negative values indicating that adsorption has taken place spontaneously tab 2 the positive value of δs 0 showed that the irregularity of the solid liquid interface increased during the adsorption process li et al 2010 adsorption of tc processes has negative δh0 values for the biosorbent a negative value of δh0 indicates that the adsorption process is exothermic and is applied spontaneously to the adsorption processes table 3 3 6 characterization of esw nzvi 2 45 ghz the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir is a widely used analytical method for determining the vibrational properties of organic or inorganic molecule regardless of the molecule s structure chemical functional groups absorb infrared light at a specific wavelength range ono et al 2011 to investigate the surface characteristics of the adsorbent and esw nzvi 2 45 ghz a magnetic adsorbent ftir analysis in the range 3500 500 cm 1 was conducted before and after tc adsorption fig 5 a it was observed when the ftir spectra of esw nzvi were compared with those of esw nzvi 2 45 ghz before and after tc adsorption that there is a 3369 99 cm 1 band before the structural oh stretching band is observed at 3386 82 cm 1 after adsorption this shift can be attributed to hydrogen bonding between tc and esw nzvi 2 45 ghz the pre adsorption spectrum shows a 1641 97 cm 1 peak associated with h o h stretching vibration which is a precursor of moisture owing to the presence of water and this peak shifted to 1628 59 cm 1 after adsorption the generation of 1419 86 cm 1 1345 58 cm 1 and 1283 71 cm 1 bands prior to adsorption along with the fact that the presence of the 1400 14 cm 1 1336 64 cm 1 and 1308 01 cm 1 peaks for these bands range between 1455 and 1240 cm 1 in literature they are ch2 s deformation vibration and the deformation vibration of co along with the stretching vibration of phenolics oh and carboxylate co thus indicating that the bands may be originated from organic matter a decrease was observed in the intensity and vibration values of the ch2 peaks after adsorption it is thought that the organics move away from the surface of the adsorbent during tc adsorption thus forming a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of water adel et al 2016 the bands between 887 67 and 705 99 cm 1 before adsorption correspond to the si h flexural vibration the bands in this interval disappeared following a shift after adsorption 588 69 cm 1 small peak and 476 59 cm 1 these bands that are nzvi modified adsorbents result from the reduced oxidation of immobilized fe0 pandele et al 2020 scanning electron microscope sem image was provided in order to examine the structural changes and morphologies before and after adsorption for the adsorption of esw nzvi 2 45 ghz via tc fig 5b c it can be observed when the sem images were examined that esw nzvi 2 45 ghz has a heterogeneous structure with cavities and pores on the surface these cavities are of significant importance for adsorption studies we may conclude that after 2 min of tc adsorption of esw nzvi 2 45 ghz the gaps in the sem picture are filled and agglomeration occurs due to the magnetic effect of nzvi experiment validation all experiments were repeated three times and average results were obtained average results were used in the calculations 3 7 the mechanism of tc adsorption on esw nzvi 2 45 ghz esw nzvi 2 45 ghz is a good adsorbent for tc removal process due to rapid external surface adsorption intraparticle diffusion process and two mechanisms intraparticle diffusion model showed that adsorption was explained bulk solution and film diffusion supported by tc

nzvi 2 45 ghz under optimum experimental conditions 20 c emr duration 2 min c0 50 mg l the experimental findings obtained via rsm which offers us the optimum adsorption conditions with fewer experiments were compared with experiment verification results determined the experimental error was within acceptable limits it was observed that the esw nzvi efficiency 23 higher than esw whereas the esw nzvi 2 45 ghz efficiency higher than 28 these results showed that emr applied innovative magnetic adsorbent of esw nzvi 2 5 ghz will be effective for tc removal it was observed when the high regression coefficients r2 for langmuir isotherm indicates that adsorption takes place under single layer and heterogeneous surfaces for esw nzvi 2 45 ghz thermodynamic parameters indicated tc

effect on tc removal the ph value of experimental conditions plays a vital role on tc removing merck from wastewater ersan and dogan 2021 initial tc concentration and adsorbent amount determined respectively as 50 mg l and 10 g l reported that the other study ersan and dogan 2022 to evaluate the effect of ph on tc removal ph was varied between 3 and 8 and the efficiency of tc removal was investigated using 10 g l esw 20 c c0 50 mg l fig 2 a tc removal efficiency improved with increasing initial ph reaching a maximum value of 64 75 for esw at ph 5 the polyhydroxyl phenolic structure and carboxyl groups polyacrylamide amide groups and functional groups of tc contribute to the complicated hydrophilic interactions amongst biosorbent molecules the ionic form of tc and the biosorbent s surface charge are ph dependent tc exists in various forms which are somewhat similar for the nonpolar and zwitterionic neutral forms but quite different for the anion form tc assumes a twisted conformation in neutral to acid conditions with the dimethylamino group located above the ring system of the molecule the molecule is in the extended conformation in basic or water free solutions where the dimethylamino group is located below the ring system bağda et al 2013 the ph of the solution where adsorption occurs has a significant value on the amount of adsorption the adsorption of ions from solution ph values are influenced by the acidic or basic environment in which the adsorption occurs i e the strong adherence of h and oh ions to the surface various ions can be adsorbed at different ph values throughout the adsorption process cao et al 2018 the high tc removal efficiency 64 75 at ph 5 indicated a significant electrostatic attraction between tc and esw increasing adsorption capacity based on the data it is believed that the removal process is electrostatic primarily adsorption the zero point of charge phpzc was obtained in fig 2 b to investigate the effect of repulsion and pull forces on tc removal ph 2 10 was determined in solutions containing 50 mg tc l at various ph values for this purpose the phpzc value of the biosorbent was determined as 6 4 with the surface positively charged below this value this scenario may be explained by the diminishing removal efficiency of tc and the influential repulsive forces of the solution parvin et al 2019 the ph value of the composites under optimal circumstances was lower than the phpzc of the adsorbent indicating that their surface was positively charged the adsorption process might be acidic or basic depending on the presence of h and oh ions on the biosorbent surface the solution containing positively charged tc has a ph of 3 3 whereas the solution containing negatively charged tc has a ph of 7 7 between these values tc exhibits dipolar properties the removal of tc is found by complexation and cationic ion exchange and the ph 5 value was determined to be 64 7 which is consistent with the literature and consistent with the effect of electrostatic attraction forces ersan et al 2015 3 2 effect of biosorbent amount on tc removal different concentrations of biosorbents were investigated using 50 mg l tc solutions under adsorption settings ph 5 c0 50 ppm t 20 c 180 rpm and 2 h to determine the effects of adsorbent amount on tc removal processes the reason for working at a solution concentration of 50 mg l in this study is that the best removal efficiency was found at this concentration in the experiments performed in the 0 100 mg l concentration range the effects of biosorbent amount on tc removal efficiency and adsorption capacity qe mg g were investigated and the maximum removal efficiencies 50 g l adsorbent amount were compared according to the literature microwave treated magnetic waste pet bottles yield to a removal efficiency of 93 38 ersan and dogan 2021 whereas cfs800 led to a removal efficiency of 30 7 at the same adsorbent amount using pyrolyzed crayfish shell biochar a biological adsorbent zhang et al 2021 eggshells have the potential to be used as an adsorbent for the adsorptive removal of a variety of contaminants from both aqueous and non aqueous solutions with maximum adsorption capacities of 195 9 185 1 125 5 and 44 6 mgg 1 for sulfamethoxazole methyl orange diclofenac sodium and dibenzothiophene respectively shi et al 2020 some literature studies were given table 1 in the present study tc removal and qe values were calculated for esw esw nzvi and esw nzvi 2 45 ghz as 73 65 3 68 90 91 4 54 and 94 61 respectively esw nzvi 2 45 ghz was synthesized using emr with an increase on tc removal efficiency of about 17 26 and 3 7 respectively compared with esw and esw nzvi thereby obtaining greater tc binding surface thus it has been demonstrated that by modifying biological adsorbents with emr and nzvi the adsorption efficiency of biological adsorbents may be enhanced these results show that esw nzvi 2 45 ghz effectively adsorbent for tc and optimization studies for tc removal conditions constructed this biosorbent 3 3 box benkhen model output of design studies constructed using the tc yk nzvi response surface method rsm among the best findings obtained the experimental settings were modeled using the box benkhen approach design expert 11 trial version keeping ph constant at 5 and the esw nzvi 2 45 ghz concentration constant at 10 g l thus determining the optimal parameters for tc removal y in the model represents the tc removal efficiency the following independent variables and their ranges were used as input variables emr t 0 4 min co 10 100 mg l and temperature 20 50 c seventeen experiments were conducted within the scope of the study modeled based on box benkhen design and four were

b 2 0 75 c 2 in order for the acquired findings to be statistically significant the probability value expressed as prob f must be less than 0 05 it is statistically insignificant for the response variables when the value exceeds 0 1000 examining r2 in conjunction with the f value is essential for determining its conformity with the anova predicted equation if the design does not fit the obtained data there is a lack of fit and the model is not suggested for use with the experimental system values of the r2 value that approach 1 indicate that there is not a significant difference between the method value and the actual value the method s f value was determined as 45 77 table 2 the method is compatible with the predicted f value with a probability value less than or equal to 0 0001 the r2 value of 0 9833 for the efficiency of tc removal demonstrates the method s accuracy while r2 adj 0 9618 and r2 pred 0 7327 are in excellent agreement if the method has many variables and the sample size is small r2 adj may be much smaller than r2 li et al 2010 it is well established that in rsm the error referred to as lack of fit is statistically negligible for the model but essential for the regression model topal and arslan topal 2020 adeq precision analyzes experimental data for determining the signal to noise ratio it is desired for the model s predicted values to have a ratio greater than four a signal to noise ratio of 12 92 suggests that the signal is adequate optimal conditions were discovered by tc removal studies using rsm experimental design emr time t was determined to 2 min the temperature was set to 20 and the initial tc concentration c0 was 50 mg l fig 3 a shows that the initial tc concentration and increasing emr time affected the tc adsorption it was discovered that increasing the temperature values boosted the efficiency of removal the effects of emr duration and initial tc concentration are combined it is clear that emr length highly affected the efficiency of tc removal at high initial tc concentration values b increasing emr time and temperature increased a quadratic effect on tc removal c increasing initial tc concentration values indicated that the second order effects of temperature on tc removal became prominent eq 16 in order to verify the test results obtained with rsm and to see the deviation from the experimental values the experiment was repeated under optimum conditions t 35 c emr mw time 2 min co 55 mg l with the removal efficiency calculated as 89 experimentally the highest tc removal efficiency was 94 61 at an optimum temperature of 20 c 2 min emr mw time and co 50 mg l experimental conditions some literature studies were given table 2 the results shown that synthesized adsorbent efficiently for tc removal 3 4 adsorption isotherms and characterization of adsorption the langmuir freundlich d r and temkin adsorption isotherms of the esw nzvi 2 45 ghz biosorbent exposed to 2 min 2 45 ghz emr were evaluated in the box benkhen design for tc removal fig 4 the qmax value for esw nzvi 2 45 ghz was determined to be 107 52 mg g demonstrating the adsorption s efficiency this explains why the heat of adsorption for all models decreases linearly with the area impacted by adsorbent adsorbent interactions on the biosorbent surface layer thus the potential direction of adsorbents for adsorbents is described by the findings from temkin isotherm model which implies a linear decrease in heat of adsorption the adsorption process is believed to involve chemical ion exchange with an e value much greater than 16 kj mol 354 kj mol table 2 panagitou et al 2018 guler and kundakci 2018 zhang et al 2011 3 5 determination of kinetic constants and thermodynamic parameters in tc adsorption the kinetic constants for the esw nzvi 2 45 ghz adsorption of tc ions were calculated using the pseudo first pseudo second and intraparticle models table 2 the elimination was determined to be appropriate for the pseudo second kinetic model with the highest r2 value 0 9999 the effect of contact time on the adsorption process was examined by working for 5 240 min for various contact periods c0 50 mg l t 120 min ph 5 it was observed that the adsorption capacity increased with increasing contact time the adsorption capacity increased with increasing contact time the calculated qe value deviated from the experimental value for the pseudo first order model in tc elimination when the experimental and theoretical qe values were compared they were found to be 4 76 mg g and 0 662 mg g respectively indicating a discrepancy however the correlation coefficient r2 of the pseudo second order kinetic model for tc adsorption was 0 9999 the qe calculated using the pseudo second order kinetic model was 4 76 mg g whereas the theoretical value was 4 79 mg g indicating that the model is suitable while linearity was not achieved to the same extent as previous models a reasonable degree of agreement was achieved with a r2 value of 0 9232 the adsorption of tc on esw nzvi 2 45 ghz is explained by a pseudo second order model by maintaining a constant concentration of biosorbent at 10 g l the effect of temperature on the adsorption process was investigated at various values 20 40 c the removal efficiency decreased with increasing temperature due to the attractive forces between the solute and the surface highest tc removal efficiency was calculated as 94 61 at 20 c the calculated gibbs free energy δg0 values were negative and remarkably close with negative values indicating that adsorption has taken place spontaneously tab 2 the positive value of δs 0 showed that the irregularity of the solid liquid interface increased during the adsorption process li et al 2010 adsorption of tc processes has negative δh0 values for the biosorbent a negative value of δh0 indicates that the adsorption process is exothermic and is applied spontaneously to the adsorption processes table 3 3 6 characterization of esw nzvi 2 45 ghz the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir is a widely used analytical method for determining the vibrational properties of organic or inorganic molecule regardless of the molecule s structure chemical functional groups absorb infrared light at a specific wavelength range ono et al 2011 to investigate the surface characteristics of the adsorbent and esw nzvi 2 45 ghz a magnetic adsorbent ftir analysis in the range 3500 500 cm 1 was conducted before and after tc adsorption fig 5 a it was observed when the ftir spectra of esw nzvi were compared with those of esw nzvi 2 45 ghz before and after tc adsorption that there is a 3369 99 cm 1 band before the structural oh stretching band is observed at 3386 82 cm 1 after adsorption this shift can be attributed to hydrogen bonding between tc and esw nzvi 2 45 ghz the pre adsorption spectrum shows a 1641 97 cm 1 peak associated with h o h stretching vibration which is a precursor of moisture owing to the presence of water and this peak shifted to 1628 59 cm 1 after adsorption the generation of 1419 86 cm 1 1345 58 cm 1 and 1283 71 cm 1 bands prior to adsorption along with the fact that the presence of the 1400 14 cm 1 1336 64 cm 1 and 1308 01 cm 1 peaks for these bands range between 1455 and 1240 cm 1 in literature they are ch2 s deformation vibration and the deformation vibration of co along with the stretching vibration of phenolics oh and carboxylate co thus indicating that the bands may be originated from organic matter a decrease was observed in the intensity and vibration values of the ch2 peaks after adsorption it is thought that the organics move away from the surface of the adsorbent during tc adsorption thus forming a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of water adel et al 2016 the bands between 887 67 and 705 99 cm 1 before adsorption correspond to the si h flexural vibration the bands in this interval disappeared following a shift after adsorption 588 69 cm 1 small peak and 476 59 cm 1 these bands that are nzvi modified adsorbents result from the reduced oxidation of immobilized fe0 pandele et al 2020 scanning electron microscope sem image was provided in order to examine the structural changes and morphologies before and after adsorption for the adsorption of esw nzvi 2 45 ghz via tc fig 5b c it can be observed when the sem images were examined that esw nzvi 2 45 ghz has a heterogeneous structure with cavities and pores on the surface these cavities are of significant importance for adsorption studies we may conclude that after 2 min of tc adsorption of esw nzvi 2 45 ghz the gaps in the sem picture are filled and agglomeration occurs due to the magnetic effect of nzvi experiment validation all experiments were repeated three times and average results were obtained average results were used in the calculations 3 7 the mechanism of tc adsorption on esw nzvi 2 45 ghz esw nzvi 2 45 ghz is a good adsorbent for tc removal process due to rapid external surface adsorption intraparticle diffusion process and two mechanisms intraparticle diffusion model showed that adsorption was explained bulk solution and film diffusion supported by tc transform on esw nzvi 2 45 ghz first mechanism defined as hydrogen bonding between tc molecules and surface and second mechanism tc molecules on fe and h fe bonding on esw nzvi 2 45 ghz surface fig s2

nzvi 2 45 ghz under optimum experimental conditions 20 c emr duration 2 min c0 50 mg l the experimental findings obtained via rsm which offers us the optimum adsorption conditions with fewer experiments were compared with experiment verification results determined the experimental error was within acceptable limits it was observed that the esw nzvi efficiency 23 higher than esw whereas the esw nzvi 2 45 ghz efficiency higher than 28 these results showed that emr applied innovative magnetic adsorbent of esw nzvi 2 5 ghz will be effective for tc removal it was observed when the high regression coefficients r2 for langmuir isotherm indicates that adsorption takes place under single layer and heterogeneous surfaces for esw nzvi 2 45 ghz thermodynamic parameters indicated tc adsorption spontaneously exothermic and irregularity increased at the solid liquid interface during tc adsorption ftir spectra with resulting peak shift proved that nzvi immobilized adsorbent after mw treatment more suitable for tc adsorption with surface morphology proven sem images as a result magnetic and radiation applied new biosorbent esw nzvi 2 45 ghz which is biological waste synthesized
