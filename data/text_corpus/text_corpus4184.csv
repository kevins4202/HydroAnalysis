hydraulic collection nodule pick up device spiral flow seafloor manganese nodules 1 introduction deep sea mining activities are expected to commence in the next decade 2020 2030 among seabed mineral resources manganese nodules have great potential for exploitation and utilization as they contain a considerable number of metallic elements they have received significant attention owing to their promising economic value massive reserves and high grades hein et al 2013 the international seafloor authority isa has already issued 17 exploration licenses for mining manganese nodules in the clarion clipperton fracture zone and central indian ocean basin the isa is seeking to approve exploitation regulations for manganese nodules by approximately 2021 but significant research and knowledge gaps remain and must be addressed clark et al 2013 miller et al 2018 economic benefits or the lack thereof and ecological preservation are considered as two key issues potentially restricting commercial exploitation in the deep sea mining industry chung 1985 boetius and haeckel 2018 a high pick up efficiency is an important performance metric for nodule pick up devices the expected collection efficiency of nodule pick up devices in engineering applications is no less than 80 hong et al 2001 ecological preservation is also very significant as improper deep sea mining methods could cause serious biodiversity losses van dover et al 2017 the impacts of nodule mining could potentially lead to an irreversible loss of some ecosystem functions especially in directly disturbed areas simon lledó et al 2019 although some biodiversity loss within mines is inevitable innovative engineering designs could reduce or minimize some risks to biodiversity among deep sea mining techniques the nodule pick up technique used to collect manganese nodules from the seabed has always been regarded as the core component as it directly determines pick up efficiency as well as the disturbance of seafloor sediment a variety of nodule pick up methods have been developed such as hydraulic collection mechanical collection and hybrid collection min et al 1997 the results from sea trials conducted by ocean management incorporated in 1978 showed that the hydraulic collection method has a higher nodule pick up efficiency and better adaptability to variations in the bottom clearance than mechanical collection mcfarlane et al 2008 for hydraulic collection several methods have been tested and evaluated in sea trials including the suck up based method coandă effect based method and double jet hydraulic method operational testing by ocean mining associates deepsea miner ii was undertaken during a 2 year test period 1977 1978 with a pick up device based on the suck up effect approximately 500 tons of nodules were dredged during a 22 h continuous pumping at a depth of approximately 4880 m showing a relatively acceptable reliability and pick up efficiency kaufman et al 1985 a japanese national project named the r d of manganese nodule mining system was conducted in the ocean from 1981 to 1997 and a coandă effect based pick up device reached a maximum pick up efficiency of 87 yamada and yamazaki 1998 it has been difficult to find pick up devices using the water jetting method that meet the requirements for ecological preservation as very large amounts of sediment are whirled up by the scouring schwarz et al 1999 several research studies have been conducted to investigate the process of hydraulic collection for the method of the water jetting hong et al 1999 conducted an experimental study in a flume tank to enhance the understanding of the hydraulic performance of a pick up device based on parametric experiments the flow rate of water jets tow speed bottom clearance and shape of baffle plates were found to be significant factors for the effective design of a hydraulic nodule pick up device yang and tang 2003 discussed the major parameters and their influences on the performance of a hydraulic pick up device using tests the results showed that a hydraulic pick up device with proper dimensions and parameters could achieve a high pick up rate and a low sediment content however it was found that the sediment plumes generated by the water jet streams caused significant problems for the sensing and measuring equipment hong et al 2010 in recent years coandă effect based pick up devices have received widespread attention and have been applied to mining robots the fundamental difference between the water jetting and coandă effect based methods is whether the nodules and sediments are directly flushed by the nozzle flow for the water jetting method the jet nozzles of front and rear pipes are directed down with angle of 45 deg and thus the nozzle flows flush the nodules and sediments directly in contrast the coandă effect based device generates the nozzle flows tangentially to a curved baffle plate resulting in lift forces by pressure difference according to bernoulli equation using this coandă effect for picking up the nodules features smaller disturbance to the sediments as the nozzle flow does not directly flush the seabed oh et al 2018 tested and evaluated the collection performance of such a pick up device in a real sea experiment and verified the effectiveness of a pilot mining robot however the energy consumption required for the high speed water jet streams is very high in this method the more electrical energy consumed by the components of the pilot mining robot the more expensive its operational cost a larger jet velocity could also produce a more severe disturbance to the sediment therefore there is a significant challenge for coandă effect based pick up devices i e in minimizing the energy consumption while also achieving the target level of collection efficiency kim et al 2019 a pick up device based on the suck up effect has a simple structure consisting of a nodule collecting pipe the fundamental research studies on its hydraulic collection techniques have received much attention in recent years a simplified hydraulic collection model was proposed for the suck up collection method a number of parameters were thought to be dominant i e those that significantly influenced the vertical and radial forces fv fr acting on the nodules including the bottom clearance h sphere diameter d collecting pipe diameter d average velocity in collecting pipe inlet v horizontal moving speed of the collecting pipe v and angle between the collecting pipe inlet and sphere θ as shown in fig 1 and table 1 zhao et al 2017 investigated the hydraulic collection of spherical nodules with various h and v based on experimental and numerical methods the vertical force of the ore spheres was expressed as empirical equations using dimensionless quantities moreover the influences of d and v on h were studied in zhao et al 2018a the characteristics of the flow field and vertical force on the spherical particle in hydraulic collection were simulated based on a detached eddy simulation des method with a six degree of freedom motion solver xiong et al 2018 simulated the settling and floating movements of spheres with different diameters flowing in a vertical pipe the motion of the spheres was resolved using a discrete element method dem and a computational fluid dynamics cfd approach was used to calculate the interstitial fluid flow the study revealed the relationship between the sphere diameter d and the critical average velocity v in collecting pipe inlet when the vertical incipient motion of the spheres occurs zhao et al 2018b established an empirical model for predicting collection performance by analyzing test results of the vertical force characteristics and vertical incipient motion characteristics of spheres in a suction flow field a phenomenon was observed in the experiments i e that the vortex could help strengthen the suction force the characteristics of the collection flow field were obtained using flow visualization tests and were applied to explain the force characteristics of particles in the suction flow field chen et al 2020 used a coupled cfd dem method to simulate the motion of a sphere as induced by the suction flow the flow and motion information including the forces displacements velocities angular velocities streamlines and wake structures were calculated the flow characteristics and suction force around the sphere were analyzed the simulated results agreed well with the experimental observations it was found that motion tangential to the circle benefits the hydraulic collection in this study an innovative concept is proposed the concept uses spiral flow to collect nodules on the seabed this innovation arose from further observing and analyzing the experiments in the previous study zhao et al 2018b chen et al 2020 a phenomenon was observed in the vertical incipient motion experiments in that the critical bottom clearance h allowing spheres to incipiently move in the vertical direction was always larger when the spheres were in circular motion before being lifted off the bottom as compared to cases where the spheres were kept nearly still under the same test conditions however the probability of the spheres moving in a circular motion before being lifted is relatively low our research interest is in understanding the mechanisms behind this phenomenon and in exploring the possibility of utilizing that mechanism to design a more efficient nodule pick up device it is inferred that the circular motion of the spheres is caused by a low pressure area near the center line of the collecting pipe therefore it was proposed that if we could enhance the stability of the central low pressure area near the spiral flow produced by a collecting pipe using a special structure we could increase the probability of the circular motion of the spheres and thus h as a result h is increased under the same v condition indicating that under the same h condition a smaller v is required to lift the nodules from the seabed this conforms to the design concept of environmentally friendly nodule pick up devices i e that the operating v should be minimized to reduce sediment disruption on the seafloor to verify this conjecture a novel pick up device with a spiral deflector inside the collecting pipe was designed using a numerical simulation model and then was validated by experiments subsequently five types of tests fixed suction moving suction suction flow field sediment water mixture and vertical incipient motion tests were implemented to investigate the differences and similarities in collection performance between pick up devices with and without spiral deflectors to reveal the suction flow field the velocity vectors and velocity distributions were measured using the particle image velocimetry piv system the collection performance discussed in this study mainly comprises three aspects characteristics of suction force and suction flow field diffusion of sediment water mixture and movement features of spheres in the suction flow field the suction forces velocity and pressure distributions of the suction flow field diffusion of sediment water mixture critical bottom clearances h and trajectory behaviors of the spheres in the collection flow field are obtained under different conditions and analyzed based on the results the advantages of the novel nodule pick up device are discussed and the relationships between the suction force and case variables are obtained as such this study can be regarded as the first step in the development of a collection performance prediction model 2 description of experiments 2 1 experimental setup experimental methods are widely used for studying problems in the transport of coarse sediment and have been verified as able to reveal the mechanisms in the vertical hydraulic lifting of solids for deep sea mining accurately van wijk et al 2014 van wijk et al 2015 to study the nodule pick up process for harvesting deep seabed manganese nodules an experimental system is designed the experiments are conducted in the state key laboratory of ocean engineering at shanghai jiao tong university the experimental system mainly consists of three parts suction movement and measurement as shown in fig 2 the suction part is mainly composed of a glass water tank a pump a flowrate meter and pipes the size of the glass tank is 2 5 m 1 5 m 1 0 m the pump s power is 22 kw and its maximum flow rate is 100 t h the ldg sin dn100 electromagnetic flowrate meter is installed at the outlet of the pump to measure the flow rate in addition a baffle is installed and a honeycomb plate is placed near the water inlet of the flume to reduce the flow turbulence caused by water discharge to the flow field near the nodule pick up device the movement part is composed of an er50 c10 six degree of freedom robot based on a fixed connection with the robot the position orientation and horizontal and vertical movements of the pick up device are precisely adjusted by the robot the kinematics precision of the robot can reach 0 01 mm for position and 0 01 for angle the measurement part includes a three component force sensor for measuring the vertical and radial forces on a sphere the sphere is fixed on the top of the sensor and the sensor is fixed on a base plate in addition an acrylic plate is horizontally installed between the sphere and sensor with a small hole at the center allowing for the connection of the sphere and sensor therefore the acrylic plate can be considered as a bottom boundary simulating the seabed in the experiment the vertical distance between the pipe inlet plane and bottom boundary is defined as the bottom clearance h as shown in fig 2 b a particle image velocimetry piv system was set up to measure the collection flow field near the nodule pick up device as shown in fig 2 c critical bottom clearances are measured to quantitatively analyze the collection performance of nodule pick up devices as soon as a sphere starts to move upwards which is recognized as when the incipient vertical motion occurs in the suction flow field the instantaneous bottom clearance h is measured and is defined as its critical bottom clearance h in the measurements of critical bottom clearance the force measurement unit is removed and the spherical particle is freely placed on the bottom boundary as shown in fig 3 to measure the value of h accurately in a fixed or moving suction case the collecting pipe descends vertically step by step with a tiny distance approximately 0 1 mm until the sphere is sucked into the pipe the h is designed to be measured as the unknown quantity in the different cases instead of v this is because smaller measurement errors of h can be obtained which benefits from the high control accuracy of the movement part nodules from the clarion clipperton zone in the equatorial ne pacific and from the central indian ocean basin predominantly have a size range of 20 80 mm kuhn et al 2017 the dry bulk density of deep ocean manganese nodules ranges between 1000 and 2400 kg m3 hein and koschinsky 2013 blöthe et al 2015 therefore the spheres used in the critical bottom clearance tests are chosen to be composed of polytetrafluoroethylene with a density ρs of 2100 kg m3 and have sphere diameters d ranging from 30 to 40 mm for the comparative study of hydraulic collection performance based on the spiral flow principle collecting pipes with and without a spiral deflector were respectively installed in the experimental setups as shown in fig 3 the spiral deflector was arranged on the inner wall of the pipe and the design was optimized using a numerical method as described and validated in section 4 3 numerical methods 3 1 mathematical model star ccm 12 02 as a cfd code is employed for numerical simulations the des method based on a shear stress transport sst model sst des is applied to simulate the forces acting on the sphere and collection flow field in hydraulic collection the numerical model as validated by the experiments is then used to design the spiral deflector constantinescu and squires 2003 applied large eddy simulation les and des to predict and investigate the flow around a sphere at a reynolds number of 10 000 in a subcritical regime comparison of the computed results with experimental data showed that the les and des were able to simulate the flow around the sphere the des is a hybrid reynolds averaged navies stokes rans les model it employs rans in the regions near the boundary layers and les in the separated regions an improved simulation accuracy can be obtained with a lower mesh number when the flow field is simulated by the des method the sst model has seen wide application in the aerospace industry where viscous flows are typically resolved turbulence models are often applied throughout the boundary layer the sst turbulence model combines the k omega and k epsilon turbulence models the k omega model is used in the inner region of the boundary layer and the k epsilon model is used in the free shear flow the sst k omega des model combines the features of the sst k omega rans model in the boundary layers with a les in the unsteady separated regions the des formulation of the sst k omega model is obtained by modifying the dissipation term in the transport equation for the turbulent kinetic energy the sst des model is selected for its high computational efficiency and good precision because the sediment water mixture is simplified as fluid state in this study the volume of fluid vof multiphase model is used to simulate the multiphase flows in the hydraulic collection the transport equations for the sst k omega des model can be presented as follows 1 ρwk t ui ρwk xi pk ρwβ fβ ωk ω0k0 xiμ σkμt k xi sk 2 ρwω t ui ρwω xi pω ρwβfβω2 ω02 xiμ σωμt ω xi sω here ω is defined as follows 3 ω ωmax lk ωcdes 1 f1 1 the parameter of turbulence scale lk ω can be obtained as follows 4 lk ω kβ ω β is a model coefficient and is calculated as follows 5 β 1 f1β1 f1β2 in the above ui is the mean velocity of the fluid particle k is the turbulent kinetic energy ω is the specific dissipation rate σk and σω are model coefficients fβ is the free shear modification factor fβ is the vortex stretching modification factor sk and sω are user specified source terms and k0 and ω0 are the ambient turbulence values that counteract turbulence decay pk and pω are production terms induced by the turbulence and are constant in the model equations according to the results in menter 1993 and menter and kuntz 2002 in eq 1 the parameter lk ω is replaced by min lk ω cdes in the des model where δ maxδx δy δz is the largest distance between the cell center under consideration and the centers of neighboring cells in the regions near the boundary layers where lk ω is less than or equal to δ the des model can be viewed as an sst model in the separated regions where lk ω becomes greater than cdes the des model can be considered as an les model in eq 3 f1 is the blending function and the model coefficient cdes is equal to 0 78 this blends the values obtained from the independent calibrations of the k epsilon and k omega branches of the k omega sst model β1 and β2 are equal to 0 09 an sst model with an accurate and robust near wall treatment and a zonal des formulation is qualified for the accurate prediction of flows with strong adverse pressure gradients and separation menter 1993 3 2 mesh subdivision and convergence verification the mesh subdivision of the computational domain without spiral deflector inside the collecting pipe is shown in fig 4 as the pressure gradient is relatively large near the hydraulic collection area the density of the trimmer mesh grid continues increasing in the area adjacent to the collecting pipe inlet and sphere in addition the heights of the outermost meshes of the boundary layer are approximately 1 3 to 1 2 of the widths of the near meshes improving the computing accuracy to investigate the mesh sensitivity of the calculated results a convergence study is carried out with different levels of refinement grid resolution table 2 shows the details for four cases of mesh settings and the corresponding results of fr and fv for the numerical cases g1 to g4 as the number of meshes increases the values of fr and fv tend to stabilize for instance the differences between the results of g3 and g4 for fr and fv are only approximately 1 37 and 1 36 respectively indicating that the mesh number of g3 is sufficiently large to achieve satisfying simulation results and has mesh independence therefore the mesh setting of g3 is selected for the final calculation table 3 shows the details of four cases of time step settings and their results for fr and fv for the numerical cases t1 t4 the differences between the results of t3 and t4 for fr and fv are only approximately 0 75 and 1 29 respectively indicating that the time step of t3 is acceptable for achieving satisfying simulation results therefore the time step of t3 is selected for the final calculation so as to accurately capture the forces on the spheres and flow field information near the spheres 3 3 validation to validate the feasibility and accuracy of the numerical methods a comparison group of 30 cases is considered in the experiments the parameters are selected as θ 0 h 50 80 mm and v 1 m s 1 4 m s and 2 m s there is no spiral deflector inside the collecting pipe the numerical results are compared with those obtained by experiments as shown in fig 5 the tolerances between the measured and simulated values of the vertical force fv are less than 10 therefore the comparison validates the good feasibility and high accuracy of the numerical method for forecasting the forces on spheres in a suction flow field 4 design optimization of the spiral deflector the innovative concept of using spiral flow to collect nodules on the seabed is proposed based on the expectation that the spiral flow inside the pick up device will increase the suction forces as well as the probability of circular motion occurring on the nodules the basis for that conjecture is from observing and analyzing previous experiments zhao et al 2018b chen et al 2020 to generate the spiral flow inside the nodule pick up device a spiral deflector is designed and fixed inside the collecting pipe as shown in fig 6 as the figure shows two different nodule pick up devices i e with and without the spiral deflector are employed to conduct comparative research on the nodule collection characteristics as the spiral flow pattern is dominated by the surface profile of the deflector an optimization design for the deflector surface profiles is conducted based on numerical simulations the two key parameters of the spiral deflector are the helical angle α and side length l as shown in fig 6 the simulation cases are set up according to various combinations of these two design parameters including nine different l values and nine different α values as shown in table 4 the pitch for all spiral deflectors is 0 112 m and the number of turns is 1 the optimal parameters of l and α are determined by the magnitude of fv d 36 mm v 1 4 m s the influence of l on fv is shown in fig 7 with the helical angle α at 30 it is clear that fv reaches its maximum when l 30 mm with the relative growth of fv peaking at 8 46 as compared to the pick up device without the deflector the relative growth is defined as the increasing proportion of fv between the cases with and without the spiral deflector therefore l 30 mm is selected as a proper parameter for the spiral deflector the influence of α on fv is presented in fig 8 with the spiral deflector side length l 30 mm fv changes slightly when α 30 and then a remarkable decline can be observed when α 30 with the decrease of α the cross sectional area of the collecting pipe decreases and a larger cross sectional area inside the pipe can reduce collisions between the spiral deflector and spheres therefore α 30 and l 30 mm are selected as the proper parameters for the spiral deflector as a result the novel nodule pick up device with the spiral deflector l 30 mm α 30 can achieve a relative growth of fv of 8 46 relative to a device without the deflector 5 case design for comparative research for the comparative research on the performance characteristics of hydraulic collection based on the spiral flow principle five groups of cases are considered for collecting pipes both with and without the spiral deflector as shown in table 5 the spiral deflector used in the five groups of cases has the parameters α 30 and l 30 mm the value range of the parameters for the cases is properly determined by comparing the vertical force with the wet weight of the sphere particle in the collection flow field for engineering practice the fr and fv values of the sphere depend on the fluid density of water ρw 1000 kg m3 kinematic viscosity coefficient of water μ 1 3081 10 3 m2 s v d h and v as a result the functions of fv and fr are defined as follows 6 fv f h θ v ρw μ v d 7 fr f h θ v ρw μ v d case group i v 0 is denoted as the fixed suction tests and is designed to study the effects of h θ and v on fr and fv the positions of the collecting pipe and the sphere are fixed and there are 15 different v values 10 different θ values and 11 different h values during the test the experiments are conducted for cases with v 1 1 4 and 2 m s 0 05 m h 0 08 m and the results are used to validate the feasibility of the numerical method subsequently the other cases in group i are simulated using the numerical method case group ii v 0 is denoted as the moving suction tests in which the collecting pipe moves horizontally at constant v and h and fv and fr are measured each test case is repeated three times and the mean values are used so as to eradicate discrepancies in the experiments case group iii is denoted as the vertical incipient motion tests the values of h with different d values are recorded under v 0 and v 25 mm s each test case is repeated 10 times and the mean values are used to eradicate discrepancies to deepen our understanding about mechanism of the hydraulic collection the collection flow field is obtained by both experimental and numerical methods in case group iv in sea bed mining area the seafloor is covered with sediment case group v is carried out to compare the disturbance to the sediment caused by the collecting process with two different nodule pick up devices and denoted as the diffusion of sediment water mixture the results of the case are obtained numerically in the simulation a sphere with a diameter of 36 mm is fixed on the bottom and the bottom is covered with 10 mm thick sediment water mixture because the surface sediment is particularly fine and soft most particle sizes range from 0 001 to 0 05 mm the sediment water mixture on the surface layer of deep seabed is simplified as the fluid state with a density of 1400 kg m3 grupe et al 2001 droppo 2006 6 results and discussion a series of experiments and simulations are implemented according to the test cases described in table 5 the test results are demonstrated and analyzed below to illuminate the influences of several parameters on the force characteristics of the spheres under different circumstances for simplicity the cases in which the moving speed of collecting pipe is zero are termed as fixed collecting that is the pipe is fixed and the cases in which the moving speed of the pipe is non zero are termed as moving collecting in addition the cases without the spiral deflector are defined as non spiral flow cases whereas the cases with the spiral deflector are defined as spiral flow cases 6 1 suction forces in fixed collecting v 0 6 1 1 influence of h on fv when s 0 θ 0 the experimental results shown in fig 9 reveal the differences in the values of vertical force fv acting on the sphere under different bottom clearances h and flow velocities in the pipe v between the spiral and non spiral flow cases the fv values of the spiral flow cases tend to be greater than those of the corresponding non spiral cases this is more significant when h is smaller for example the force value of the spiral flow is 0 3675 n for a spiral flow case as compared to 0 2952 n for a non spiral flow showing an increase up to 24 49 when h 50 mm and v 1 0 m s as h increases the fv produced by spiral flow declines more significantly and the differences between the results of the spiral and non spiral flow cases become smaller 6 1 2 influence of h d on cv when s 0 θ 0 a dimensionless method is used to further analyze the result data the vertical force coefficient cv and radial force coefficient cr are defined in eqs 8 and 9 as follows 8 cv fvπ8ρwv2d2 9 cr frπ8ρwv2d2 fig 10 presents a comparison between the spiral and non spiral flow test cases in terms of the relationship between the logarithms of cv and h d it is clear that the ln cv in the spiral flow cases is always larger than that in non spiral flow cases with the decrease of h d the differences in cv become larger the ln cv are found to have a significant linear relationship with h d it indicates that cv decreases exponentially with increasing h d 1 428 h 2 285 the fitting formulae are obtained by analyzing the test results as shown in eqs 10 and 11 it is found that in the fitting formulae the absolute values of both the slope and intercept in the spiral flow cases are larger than those in the non spiral flow cases the formulae can be used as guidance for adjusting h to obtain proper suction forces at a constant v in engineering applications 10 lncv 2 5295 h d 2 9591 r2 0 9987 11 lncv 2 7247 h d 3 4285 r2 0 9972 6 1 3 influence of h d on cr and cv when s 36 mm to investigate the influence of h d on cr and cv in more general situations s is introduced and is defined as the distance between the center line of the collecting pipe and center of the sphere the simulation cases where this distance is equal to d are studied here for the cases s 36 mm θ increases with a decrease of h as shown in fig 11 the ln cr h d curves have characteristics similar to those in the ln cv h d curves in fig 10 with the increase of h d the ln cr in the spiral flow cases is always larger than that of the corresponding non spiral cases as h d decreases the differences in cr become larger a strong exponential relationship between cr and h d is also obtained the fitting formulae between ln cr and h d are shown in eqs 12 and 13 12 lncr 2 993 h d 2 608 r2 0 9992 13 lncr 3 026 h d 2 579 r2 0 9991 as the position of the sphere deviates from the center line of the collecting pipe s 0 the cv h d curve in fig 12 shows curve characteristics that are different from those in fig 10 when h d 1 55 the ln cv values in the spiral flow and non spiral flow cases are almost equal when h d 1 55 the ln cv values in the spiral flow cases are slightly smaller than those in non spiral flow cases this is owing to the characteristics of the spiral flow field as the low pressure area is more concentrated along the axis of the collecting pipe as h d decreases θ increases therefore the enhancement effect of fv in the spiral flow will disappear when θ is beyond a certain value the influence of θ on fv will be fully discussed in the next section the similarity between the cases s 0 and s 36 mm is that the cv values in both the spiral and non spiral flow cases are found to have a significant exponential relationship with h d the fitting formulae are obtained as shown in eqs 14 and 15 for the novel nodule pick up device based on spiral flow principle the collection performance prediction could be based on the strong functional relationships among key parameter variables 14 lncv 2 804 h d 3 137 r2 0 9966 15 lncv 2 774 h d 3 060 r2 0 9965 6 1 4 influence of θ on cr and cv the forces acting on the sphere under 10 different θ values in spiral and non spiral flows are calculated by the numerical method and then comparatively analyzed as shown in fig 13 the cr θ curve does not include the results of θ 0 and θ 5 as the average value of cr tends to zero the enhancement effect of cr in the spiral flow can be seen from fig 13 where cr is larger in the spiral flow than in the non spiral flow when 10 θ 45 for the case h d 1 4583 θ 20 the cr value in the spiral flow is 22 7 larger than that in the non spiral flow for both spiral and non spiral flow cases cr increases first and then decreases and reaches its maximum value at θ 40 as to the cv θ curve shown in fig 14 a phenomenon is observed i e the enhancement effect of cv in the spiral flow is greatly influenced by θ when θ 20 the cv in the spiral flow is larger than that in the non spiral flow with the biggest relative growth of 11 3 in the case θ 0 h d 1 5278 with an increase of θ the differences between cv values in the spiral and non spiral flows become smaller the cv values in spiral flow cases are very close to those in non spiral flow cases when θ 20 and slightly smaller than that in non spiral flow cases when 30 θ 45 this is because the low pressure area is more concentrated in the spiral flow field as θ increases the low pressure area under the collecting pipe would have an enhancement effect on cr in the range 10 θ 45 and on cv in the range 0 θ 20 for both spiral and non spiral flow cases cv decreases at an increasing rate for environmentally friendly nodules mining near the seabed a proper suction force will allow the nodules to be lifted precisely indicating that the suction force acting on the nodule is neither too big nor too small there are many benefits to precise nodule lifting such as steady nodule pick up efficiency minimization of sediment disruption and lower energy consumption the collection process for nodules could be described as follows at the start the nodules move horizontally to the center line of the pipe under fr with θ decreasing and fv increasing then the nodules are sucked into the collecting pipe when fv increases to a certain value i e larger than their weights in seawater the characteristics of the collection method based on spiral flow can be beneficial in that process as the enhancement effect on fr will assist in moving nodules towards the pipe to be sucked into the pipe under larger fv through a comprehensive analysis of results in figs 10 14 it is found that 1 with a decrease of h d the differences in the results between spiral and non spiral flows have an increasing tendency 2 for both spiral and non spiral flow cases the ln cr h d and ln cv h d curves have the common characteristics e g ln cr and ln cv increase linearly as h d increases and 3 the cr values in spiral flow cases are always larger than those in non spiral flow cases the maximum enhancement value for cr is up to 22 7 in the case h d 1 4583 θ 20 the cv in the spiral flow cases is larger when θ 20 and slightly smaller when θ 30 the maximum enhancement value for cv is up to 11 3 in the case h d 1 5278 θ 0 by comparing the results in the spiral flow and non spiral flow cases the mechanisms of the suction force enhancement in the spiral flow are analyzed 6 1 5 influence of re on cr and cv to study the impacts of v on fr and fv in spiral and non spiral flows 15 different v values are used ranging from 0 8 to 2 2 m s in intervals of 0 1 m s in numerical simulations as shown in fig 15 fr and fv increase linearly with v2 and the fitting formulas are shown in the figure the reynolds number re is defined in eq 16 as follows 16 re ρwvdμ the v used in the definition of re is the average velocity in collecting pipe inlet rather than the velocity around the particle fig 16 shows the results of cv and cr for different re at h d 1 5278 and θ 25 it can be seen that the force coefficients are nearly independent of re this feature could provide guidance for adjusting v to obtain proper suction forces in engineering applications 6 2 collection flow field in the case h 60 mm v 1 4 m s d 36 mm v 0 6 2 1 collection flow field without sediment water mixture the velocity vectors and velocity distribution in non spiral and spiral flows measured by the piv system are shown in fig 17 the numerical results of the collection flow field are shown in fig 18 by comparing the velocity distributions in fig 18 c d and 17 a b it is found that the numerical results match well with those measured by piv system in both non spiral and spiral flow cases vf are large near the top part of the sphere but are small at the bottom half this velocity distribution is beneficial for achieving a larger suction force as well as ensuring smaller disturbances to the seabed meanwhile vf always achieves its maximum near the axial line of the collecting pipe the maximum of vf is approximately twice as big as the average velocity v in collecting pipe inlet in non spiral flow and three times in spiral flow in the region outside of the collecting pipe vf increases as the fluid particle approaches the pipe inlet fig 18 c indicates that the pressure distribution is approximately symmetric along the axis in the non spiral flow but it is asymmetric in the spiral flow case due to the arrangement of the spiral deflector a tubular vortex region near the top of the sphere is observed as shown in fig 18 d therefore the effect that fv is always larger in the spiral flow cases can be explained that the localized low pressure area near the top of the sphere can increase its vertical pressure difference the distributions of vf at the line 10 mm below the pipe inlet x 0 150 y 150 mm z 50 mm in non spiral and spiral flow cases are quantitatively analyzed as shown in fig 19 it is verified that the collection flow field prediction based on numerical simulation is feasible by comparing the vf y curves with the measurements the value vf always achieves its local maximum at y 50 mm and reaches its local minimum at y 0 those curves are approximately symmetric along the line y 0 in the non spiral flow case whereas asymmetric at 50 y 50 mm in the spiral flow case 6 2 2 collection flow field with sediment water mixture the surface layer of deep seabed will be modified by the collecting process of manganese nodules surface sediments are mechanically disturbed with a cloud of sediment particles suspended and redeposited to compare the disturbance to the sediment water mixture caused by the collecting process with two different nodule pick up devices the diffusion of sediment water mixture within 0 5 s after the launching of the two devices are calculated and compared to each other fig 20 and 21 show the time evolution of volume fraction of sediment water mixture in non spiral flow and spiral flow sediment water mixture are sucked into the collecting pipe from the bottom meanwhile there is no diffusion of mixture outside the collecting pipe in the two cases which is beneficial to ensure the performance of various sensors e g distance sensors imaging sensors near the collecting pipe in sediment water mixture tests no significant difference in diffusion degree can been observed comparing to the non spiral flow case the profile of sediment diffusion gradually gets more concentrated in the spiral flow case this difference is caused by the spiral flow inside the collecting pipe the volume fraction of sediment water mixture along the horizontal line at the collecting pipe inlet x 0 z h 60 mm 50 y 50 mm when t 0 5 s are analyzed as shown in fig 22 the curves in the figure are approximately symmetric along the line y 0 and the left half of the curves 50 y 0 mm can be divided into three regions according to their trends in region i 50 y 25 mm the volume fraction of mixture is almost 0 as y increases the volume fraction increases approximately linearly in region ii 25 y 7 5 mm and get close to 1 in region iii 7 5 y 0 mm the volume fraction is almost constant with the value of 1 the figure shows that the volume of sediment water mixture is sucked a little bigger in the non spiral flow than that in the spiral flow this means that for the cases with the same v forces on sphere are bigger in spiral flow case while the flow field disturbance near the seabed is slightly smaller the spiral flow pick up device shows advantage in reducing disturbance to sediment water mixture when generating the equal suction forces on the nodules 6 3 suction forces in moving collecting v 0 with the low horizontal moving speed v 2 5 mm s of the collecting pipe in the experiments fig 23 presents a comparison of cr and cv in spiral and non spiral flow cases under two different values of h d the cr θ curve in fig 23 a b shows that 1 as the collecting pipe moves from one side to the other at a constant horizontal moving speed of 2 5 mm s the cr values in both the spiral and non spiral cases first increase to a maximum value at θ 40 45 and then decrease reaching a minimum close to 0 at θ 0 and the cr θ curve is almost symmetrical in terms of the point θ 0 2 the cr value in the spiral flow cases is larger than that in the non spiral flow cases and with an increase of h d the differences between the spiral and non spiral flow cases become smaller the maximum values of the relative growth of cr in the spiral flow cases are 28 57 at h d 1 4583 and 18 18 at h d 1 5278 relative to the non spiral flow cases and 3 when θ 50 the values of cr in the spiral and non spiral flow cases are almost equal the cv θ curve in fig 23 c and d shows that 1 for both spiral and non spiral flow cases as the collecting pipe moves from one side to the other cv increases first and then decreases and the cv θ curve is approximately symmetrical with the line θ 0 moreover cv always reaches the maximum and fluctuates slightly when θ 20 2 the cv value in spiral flow cases is larger than that in non spiral flow cases and the difference is more significant as collecting pipe moves closer to the sphere the maximum value in the spiral flow cases has an increase of up to 23 08 at h d 1 4583 and to 18 75 at h d 1 5278 relative to non spiral flow cases when θ 40 the cv values are almost equal in the spiral and non spiral flow cases to investigate the influence of the horizontal moving speed v on the force characteristics of the spheres comparisons of cr and cv between spiral and non spiral flow cases under two different h d values and seven different v values are presented in fig 24 25 respectively the cr θ curves shown in fig 24 illustrate that 1 for spiral and non spiral cases with different values of v cr cv always reaches the maximum value when the value of θ is close to 40 and when 0 θ 25 as v increases cr tends to be larger 2 the cr values in spiral flow cases are larger than those in non spiral flow cases crmax and cvmax shown in figs 24 25 are denoted as the maximum value of the cr and cv respectively crmax in the spiral flow cases has an increase up to 7 81 when h d is 1 4583 and to 6 02 when h d is 1 5278 as can be seen from fig 25 1 cv always changes slowly and reaches the maximum value when θ 20 additionally cv is not susceptible to changes of v when 20 θ 60 2 cv in spiral flow cases is larger than that in non spiral flow cases the maximum value of cvmax the spiral flow cases shows an increase of up to 19 31 when h d is 1 4583 and up to 21 04 when h d is 1 5278 6 4 vertical incipient motions vertical incipient motion tests are conducted to measure the critical bottom clearance h which is another aspect for evaluating the collection performance besides the suction forces in addition the motion characteristics of the spheres in the process of being lifted are investigated to verify a conjecture i e that there will be a bigger probability of the circular motion of the spheres in the spiral flow cases than in the non spiral flow cases during the process of the spheres being lifted into the collecting pipe circular motion can be observed in both the spiral flow and non spiral flow cases the trajectories of the spheres are recorded and analyzed to study the trajectory behavior in the collection process by observing pictures taken by a high speed camera it is found that in some cases the sphere is lifted vertically with little side deviation as shown in fig 26 a and c whereas in other cases the sphere is in circular motion before being lifted the spiral like trajectories are drawn as shown in fig 26 b and d the cases with circular motions are underlined as shown in table 6 a and 6 b it is found that the existence of the spiral deflector can remarkably increase the probability of the circular motion of the spheres the probability of occurrence of the circular motion of the spheres when using the spiral deflector is 72 5 in cases with v 0 and 90 0 in cases with v 25 mm s whereas this probability for a collecting pipe without spiral deflector is only 22 5 in cases with v 0 and 37 5 in cases with v 25 mm s the probability of circular motion for a sphere being picked up by the pick up device with the spiral deflector is 3 22 times higher than that without spiral deflector in cases with v 0 and 2 4 times higher in cases with v 25 mm s in addition it is found that the horizontal moving speed of the collecting pipe has a positive impact on increasing this probability with an increase of v the occurrence probability has an increase up to 66 67 in spiral flow cases and 24 14 in non spiral flow cases this indicates that the spiral suction flow can significantly increase the probability of the circular motion of the spheres and enhance the positive effect between the horizontal moving speed and the probability as shown in tables 6 a and 6 b the critical bottom clearances h under spiral and non spiral flow cases where v 0 and v 25 mm s are measured and analyzed h represents the value of the bottom clearance h when the vertical incipient motion of the spheres occurs in the collection tests with the spheres being freely placed on the bottom ground four different sizes of spheres based on d are selected in the tests namely 40 mm 36 mm 32 mm and 30 mm denoted as d40 d36 d32 and d30 respectively each of the test cases is repeated 10 times and each h is recorded as hi i 1 2 10 then the mean value h and standard deviation are calculated the critical bottom clearance h is always larger in cases where the spheres are in circular motion when being lifted as can be concluded from both the spiral and non spiral flow cases in d30 cases the mean value h in the spiral flow cases has an increase up to 6 50 where v 0 and to 5 24 where v 25 mm s this phenomenon could be explained by assuming that the circular motion of spheres is generated by the vortex near the center line of the collecting pipe this vortex could effectively increase the suction forces on the spheres compared with a non spiral flow a more concentrated low pressure area near the collecting pipe inlet could provide centripetal force to the spheres and significantly increase the probability of the circular motion of the spheres it is clear that in both spiral and non spiral flow cases the h values for the spheres of the four different d values in cases where v 0 are smaller than those in cases where v 25 mm s this could be explained by the relative motion between the collecting pipe and sphere forming a convection zone near the sphere increasing the suction force the small standard deviation for the spiral and non spiral flow cases shows that the test results have low fluctuation and high repeatability and are therefore stable and reliable meanwhile the mean value of h for the four differently sized spheres in the spiral flow cases is larger than that in the non spiral flow cases there may be two reasons for this result one is that the enhancement effect on fr and fv in the spiral flow as demonstrated by suction force tests the sphere is fixed on the force sensor can help increase the value of h another is that the movement of spheres in the spiral flow cases is usually greater and faster which could increase the local flow velocity near the sphere and thus increase the fr and fv the feasibility and beneficial effects of this innovative design i e using spiral flow to collect nodules are verified by the critical bottom clearance measurements the reduction in v requirements during the hydraulic collection process could not only reduce energy consumption but could also minimize flow field disturbances near the seabed 7 conclusions a novel type of nodule pick up device based on the spiral flow principle is proposed and verified for hydraulic collection the spiral flow in the pick up device is induced by a spiral deflector arranged on the inner wall of the pipe and the design is optimized through a verified and validated numerical method a piv system is used to acquire detailed data regarding the collection flow field to investigate the differences and similarities in collection performance between pick up devices with and without spiral deflectors five types of cases are implemented the results prove that the pick up device using the spiral flow principle can achieve enhanced suction forces on the nodules an increased h when v is constant as well as a significantly increased occurrence probability of the circular motion of nodules the nodule pick up device with the spiral deflector has beneficial effects in regard to the enhancement of suction forces under certain conditions for fixed suction cases the pick up device with the spiral deflector can produce a larger vertical force coefficient cv when θ 20 and a larger radial force coefficient cr when 10 θ 45 as compared to the pick up device without the spiral deflector with a decrease of h d the differences in the cv and cr values between the spiral and non spiral flow cases increase for the moving suction cases the maximum value of the relative growth of cr in the spiral flow is 28 57 and that of cv is 23 08 when h d is 1 4583 compared to the non spiral flow cases it is validated that the prediction of suction forces and collection flow filed characteristics based on numerical simulation is feasible a tubular vortex region near the top of the sphere is observed in the spiral flow case the localized low pressure area near the top of the sphere can increase its vertical pressure difference so as to enhance the suction force on the sphere the volume fraction of mixture at the collecting pipe inlet in non spiral flow is slightly bigger than that in spiral flow under the same v i e the spiral flow pick up device shows advantage in reducing disturbance to sediment water mixture when generating equal suction forces in the vertical incipient motion tests a phenomenon is observed that a sphere moving in a circular motion before being lifted always has a larger h with careful analysis of the test statistics it is determined that the occurrence probability of the circular motion of the sphere for the pick up device with the spiral deflector is 3 22 times higher than that without the spiral deflector in cases where v 0 and 2 4 times higher in cases where v 25 mm s with an increase of v the occurrence probability has an increase up to 66 67 in spiral flow cases and 24 14 in non spiral flow cases this indicates that the spiral suction flow can offer significant improvements in the probability of the circular motion of the spheres and enhance the positive effect between the horizontal moving speed and the probability the critical bottom clearance h is measured when the vertical incipient motion of the spheres occurs before being sucked into the pick up device the pick up device with the spiral deflector always has a larger h as compared to non spiral cases with identical conditions in d30 cases the mean value h in the spiral flow cases has an increase up to 6 50 where v 0 and to 5 24 where v 25 mm s it also means that in cases with a constant h a smaller v is required to lift the nodules from the seabed there are also some similarities in collection performance in the spiral and non spiral flow cases it is found that c v has a significant exponential relationship with h d h d 1 39 2 22 and is nearly independent of the reynolds number r e ranging from 22 000 to 60 500 the c r always reaches a maximum when 40 θ 45 whereas c v always reaches the peak when θ 20 when θ 25 as v increases c r tends to be larger c v is not susceptible to changes of v when 20 θ 60 in addition it is found the horizontal moving speed of the collecting pipe has a positive impact on increasing the occurrence probability these features can be applied to build collection performance prediction models for achieving precise nodule collection and obtaining an optimal balance among the nodule collection rate energy consumption and sediment disruption the results of this study will serve to further the understanding of the mechanisms of hydraulic collection and provide reference for conceptual design of key

prediction models to thereby achieve precise nodule collection thus this study concentrates on the conceptual design and performance verification of a nodule pick up device keywords deep sea mining hydraulic collection nodule pick up device spiral flow seafloor manganese nodules 1 introduction deep sea mining activities are expected to commence in the next decade 2020 2030 among seabed mineral resources manganese nodules have great potential for exploitation and utilization as they contain a considerable number of metallic elements they have received significant attention owing to their promising economic value massive reserves and high grades hein et al 2013 the international seafloor authority isa has already issued 17 exploration licenses for mining manganese nodules in the clarion clipperton fracture zone and central indian ocean basin the isa is seeking to approve exploitation regulations for manganese nodules by approximately 2021 but significant research and knowledge gaps remain and must be addressed clark et al 2013 miller et al 2018 economic benefits or the lack thereof and ecological preservation are considered as two key issues potentially restricting commercial exploitation in the deep sea mining industry chung 1985 boetius and haeckel 2018 a high pick up efficiency is an important performance metric for nodule pick up devices the expected collection efficiency of nodule pick up devices in engineering applications is no less than 80 hong et al 2001 ecological preservation is also very significant as improper deep sea mining methods could cause serious biodiversity losses van dover et al 2017 the impacts of nodule mining could potentially lead to an irreversible loss of some ecosystem functions especially in directly disturbed areas simon lledó et al 2019 although some biodiversity loss within mines is inevitable innovative engineering designs could reduce or minimize some risks to biodiversity among deep sea mining techniques the nodule pick up technique used to collect manganese nodules from the seabed has always been regarded as the core component as it directly determines pick up efficiency as well as the disturbance of seafloor sediment a variety of nodule pick up methods have been developed such as hydraulic collection mechanical collection and hybrid collection min et al 1997 the results from sea trials conducted by ocean management incorporated in 1978 showed that the hydraulic collection method has a higher nodule pick up efficiency and better adaptability to variations in the bottom clearance than mechanical collection mcfarlane et al 2008 for hydraulic collection several methods have been tested and evaluated in sea trials including the suck up based method coandă effect based method and double jet hydraulic method operational testing by ocean mining associates deepsea miner ii was undertaken during a 2 year test period 1977 1978 with a pick up device based on the suck up effect approximately 500 tons of nodules were dredged during a 22 h continuous pumping at a depth of approximately 4880 m showing a relatively acceptable reliability and pick up efficiency kaufman et al 1985 a japanese national project named the r d of manganese nodule mining system was conducted in the ocean from 1981 to 1997 and a coandă effect based pick up device reached a maximum pick up efficiency of 87 yamada and yamazaki 1998 it has been difficult to find pick up devices using the water jetting method that meet the requirements for ecological preservation as very large amounts of sediment are whirled up by the scouring schwarz et al 1999 several research studies have been conducted to investigate the process of hydraulic collection for the method of the water jetting hong et al 1999 conducted an experimental study in a flume tank to enhance the understanding of the hydraulic performance of a pick up device based on parametric experiments the flow rate of water jets tow speed bottom clearance and shape of baffle plates were found to be significant factors for the effective design of a hydraulic nodule pick up device yang and tang 2003 discussed the major parameters and their influences on the performance of a hydraulic pick up device using tests the results showed that a hydraulic pick up device with proper dimensions and parameters could achieve a high pick up rate and a low sediment content however it was found that the sediment plumes generated by the water jet streams caused significant problems for the sensing and measuring equipment hong et al 2010 in recent years coandă effect based pick up devices have received widespread attention and have been applied to mining robots the fundamental difference between the water jetting and coandă effect based methods is whether the nodules and sediments are directly flushed by the nozzle flow for the water jetting method the jet nozzles of front and rear pipes are directed down with angle of 45 deg and thus the nozzle flows flush the nodules and sediments directly in contrast the coandă effect based device generates the nozzle flows tangentially to a curved baffle plate resulting in lift forces by pressure difference according to bernoulli equation using this coandă effect for picking up the nodules features smaller disturbance to the sediments as the nozzle flow does not directly flush the seabed oh et al 2018 tested and evaluated the collection performance of such a pick up device in a real sea experiment and verified the effectiveness of a pilot mining robot however the energy consumption required for the high speed water jet streams is very high in this method the more electrical energy consumed by the components of the pilot mining robot the more expensive its operational cost a larger jet velocity could also produce a more severe disturbance to the sediment therefore there is a significant challenge for coandă effect based pick up devices i e in minimizing the energy consumption while also achieving the target level of collection efficiency kim et al 2019 a pick up device based on the suck up effect has a simple structure consisting of a nodule collecting pipe the fundamental research studies on its hydraulic collection techniques have received much attention in recent years a simplified hydraulic collection model was proposed for the suck up collection method a number of parameters were thought to be dominant i e those that significantly influenced the vertical and radial forces fv fr acting on the nodules including the bottom clearance h sphere diameter d collecting pipe diameter d average velocity in collecting pipe inlet v horizontal moving speed of the collecting pipe v and angle between the collecting pipe inlet and sphere θ as shown in fig 1 and table 1 zhao et al 2017 investigated the hydraulic collection of spherical nodules with various h and v based on experimental and numerical methods the vertical force of the ore spheres was expressed as empirical equations using dimensionless quantities moreover the influences of d and v on h were studied in zhao et al 2018a the characteristics of the flow field and vertical force on the spherical particle in hydraulic collection were simulated based on a detached eddy simulation des method with a six degree of freedom motion solver xiong et al 2018 simulated the settling and floating movements of spheres with different diameters flowing in a vertical pipe the motion of the spheres was resolved using a discrete element method dem and a computational fluid dynamics cfd approach was used to calculate the interstitial fluid flow the study revealed the relationship between the sphere diameter d and the critical average velocity v in collecting pipe inlet when the vertical incipient motion of the spheres occurs zhao et al 2018b established an empirical model for predicting collection performance by analyzing test results of the vertical force characteristics and vertical incipient motion characteristics of spheres in a suction flow field a phenomenon was observed in the experiments i e that the vortex could help strengthen the suction force the characteristics of the collection flow field were obtained using flow visualization tests and were applied to explain the force characteristics of particles in the suction flow field chen et al 2020 used a coupled cfd dem method to simulate the motion of a sphere as induced by the suction flow the flow and motion information including the forces displacements velocities angular velocities streamlines and wake structures were calculated the flow characteristics and suction force around the sphere were analyzed the simulated results agreed well with the experimental observations it was found that motion tangential to the circle benefits the hydraulic collection in this study an innovative concept is proposed the concept uses spiral flow to collect nodules on the seabed this innovation arose from further observing and analyzing the experiments in the previous study zhao et al 2018b chen et al 2020 a phenomenon was observed in the vertical incipient motion experiments in that the critical bottom clearance h allowing spheres to incipiently move in the vertical direction was always larger when the spheres were in circular motion before being lifted off the bottom as compared to cases where the spheres were kept nearly still under the same test conditions however the probability of the spheres moving in a circular motion before being lifted is relatively low our research interest is in understanding the mechanisms behind this phenomenon and in exploring the possibility of utilizing that mechanism to design a more efficient nodule pick up device it is inferred that the circular motion of the spheres is caused by a low pressure area near the center line of the collecting pipe therefore it was proposed that if we could enhance the stability of the central low pressure area near the spiral flow produced by a collecting pipe using a special structure we could increase the probability of the circular motion of the spheres and thus h as a result h is increased under the same v condition indicating that under the same h condition a smaller v is required to lift the nodules from the seabed this conforms to the design concept of environmentally friendly nodule pick up devices i e that the operating v should be minimized to reduce sediment disruption on the seafloor to verify this conjecture a novel pick up device with a spiral deflector inside the collecting pipe was designed using a numerical simulation model and then was validated by experiments subsequently five types of tests fixed suction moving suction suction flow field sediment water mixture and vertical incipient motion tests were implemented to investigate the differences and similarities in collection performance between pick up devices with and without spiral deflectors to reveal the suction flow field the velocity vectors and velocity distributions were measured using the particle image velocimetry piv system the collection performance discussed in this study mainly comprises three aspects characteristics of suction force and suction flow field diffusion of sediment water mixture and movement features of spheres in the suction flow field the suction forces velocity and pressure distributions of the suction flow field diffusion of sediment water mixture critical bottom clearances h and trajectory behaviors of the spheres in the collection flow field are obtained under different conditions and analyzed based on the results the advantages of the novel nodule pick up device are discussed and the relationships between the suction force and case variables are obtained as such this study can be regarded as the first step in the development of a collection performance prediction model 2 description of experiments 2 1 experimental setup experimental methods are widely used for studying problems in the transport of coarse sediment and have been verified as able to reveal the mechanisms in the vertical hydraulic lifting of solids for deep sea mining accurately van wijk et al 2014 van wijk et al 2015 to study the nodule pick up process for harvesting deep seabed manganese nodules an experimental system is designed the experiments are conducted in the state key laboratory of ocean engineering at shanghai jiao tong university the experimental system mainly consists of three parts suction movement and measurement as shown in fig 2 the suction part is mainly composed of a glass water tank a pump a flowrate meter and pipes the size of the glass tank is 2 5 m 1 5 m 1 0 m the pump s power is 22 kw and its maximum flow rate is 100 t h the ldg sin dn100 electromagnetic flowrate meter is installed at the outlet of the pump to measure the flow rate in addition a baffle is installed and a honeycomb plate is placed near the water inlet of the flume to reduce the flow turbulence caused by water discharge to the flow field near the nodule pick up device the movement part is composed of an er50 c10 six degree of freedom robot based on a fixed connection with the robot the position orientation and horizontal and vertical movements of the pick up device are precisely adjusted by the robot the kinematics precision of the robot can reach 0 01 mm for position and 0 01 for angle the measurement part includes a three component force sensor for measuring the vertical and radial forces on a sphere the sphere is fixed on the top of the sensor and the sensor is fixed on a base plate in addition an acrylic plate is horizontally installed between the sphere and sensor with a small hole at the center allowing for the connection of the sphere and sensor therefore the acrylic plate can be considered as a bottom boundary simulating the seabed in the experiment the vertical distance between the pipe inlet plane and bottom boundary is defined as the bottom clearance h as shown in fig 2 b a particle image velocimetry piv system was set up to measure the collection flow field near the nodule pick up device as shown in fig 2 c critical bottom clearances are measured to quantitatively analyze the collection performance of nodule pick up devices as soon as a sphere starts to move upwards which is recognized as when the incipient vertical motion occurs in the suction flow field the instantaneous bottom clearance h is measured and is defined as its critical bottom clearance h in the measurements of critical bottom clearance the force measurement unit is removed and the spherical particle is freely placed on the bottom boundary as shown in fig 3 to measure the value of h accurately in a fixed or moving suction case the collecting pipe descends vertically step by step with a tiny distance approximately 0 1 mm until the sphere is sucked into the pipe the h is designed to be measured as the unknown quantity in the different cases instead of v this is because smaller measurement errors of h can be obtained which benefits from the high control accuracy of the movement part nodules from the clarion clipperton zone in the equatorial ne pacific and from the central indian ocean basin predominantly have a size range of 20 80 mm kuhn et al 2017 the dry bulk density of deep ocean manganese nodules ranges between 1000 and 2400 kg m3 hein and koschinsky 2013 blöthe et al 2015 therefore the spheres used in the critical bottom clearance tests are chosen to be composed of polytetrafluoroethylene with a density ρs of 2100 kg m3 and have sphere diameters d ranging from 30 to 40 mm for the comparative study of hydraulic collection performance based on the spiral flow principle collecting pipes with and without a spiral deflector were respectively installed in the experimental setups as shown in fig 3 the spiral deflector was arranged on the inner wall of the pipe and the design was optimized using a numerical method as described and validated in section 4 3 numerical methods 3 1 mathematical model star ccm 12 02 as a cfd code is employed for numerical simulations the des method based on a shear stress transport sst model sst des is applied to simulate the forces acting on the sphere and collection flow field in hydraulic collection the numerical model as validated by the experiments is then used to design the spiral deflector constantinescu and squires 2003 applied large eddy simulation les and des to predict and investigate the flow around a sphere at a reynolds number of 10 000 in a subcritical regime comparison of the computed results with experimental data showed that the les and des were able to simulate the flow around the sphere the des is a hybrid reynolds averaged navies stokes rans les model it employs rans in the regions near the boundary layers and les in the separated regions an improved simulation accuracy can be obtained with a lower mesh number when the flow field is simulated by the des method the sst model has seen wide application in the aerospace industry where viscous flows are typically resolved turbulence models are often applied throughout the boundary layer the sst turbulence model combines the k omega and k epsilon turbulence models the k omega model is used in the inner region of the boundary layer and the k epsilon model is used in the free shear flow the sst k omega des model combines the features of the sst k omega rans model in the boundary layers with a les in the unsteady separated regions the des formulation of the sst k omega model is obtained by modifying the dissipation term in the transport equation for the turbulent kinetic energy the sst des model is selected for its high computational efficiency and good precision because the sediment water mixture is simplified as fluid state in this study the volume of fluid vof multiphase model is used to simulate the multiphase flows in the hydraulic collection the transport equations for the sst k omega des model can be presented as follows 1 ρwk t ui ρwk xi pk ρwβ fβ ωk ω0k0 xiμ σkμt k xi sk 2 ρwω t ui ρwω xi pω ρwβfβω2 ω02 xiμ σωμt ω xi sω here ω is defined as follows 3 ω ωmax lk ωcdes 1 f1 1 the parameter of turbulence scale lk ω can be obtained as follows 4 lk ω kβ ω β is a model coefficient and is calculated as follows 5 β 1 f1β1 f1β2 in the above ui is the mean velocity of the fluid particle k is the turbulent kinetic energy ω is the specific dissipation rate σk and σω are model coefficients fβ is the free shear modification factor fβ is the vortex stretching modification factor sk and sω are user specified source terms and k0 and ω0 are the ambient turbulence values that counteract turbulence decay pk and pω are production terms induced by the turbulence and are constant in the model equations according to the results in menter 1993 and menter and kuntz 2002 in eq 1 the parameter lk ω is replaced by min lk ω cdes in the des model where δ maxδx δy δz is the largest distance between the cell center under consideration and the centers of neighboring cells in the regions near the boundary layers where lk ω is less than or equal to δ the des model can be viewed as an sst model in the separated regions where lk ω becomes greater than cdes the des model can be considered as an les model in eq 3 f1 is the blending function and the model coefficient cdes is equal to 0 78 this blends the values obtained from the independent calibrations of the k epsilon and k omega branches of the k omega sst model β1 and β2 are equal to 0 09 an sst model with an accurate and robust near wall treatment and a zonal des formulation is qualified for the accurate prediction of flows with strong adverse pressure gradients and separation menter 1993 3 2 mesh subdivision and convergence verification the mesh subdivision of the computational domain without spiral deflector inside the collecting pipe is shown in fig 4 as the pressure gradient is relatively large near the hydraulic collection area the density of the trimmer mesh grid continues increasing in the area adjacent to the collecting pipe inlet and sphere in addition the heights of the outermost meshes of the boundary layer are approximately 1 3 to 1 2 of the widths of the near meshes improving the computing accuracy to investigate the mesh sensitivity of the calculated results a convergence study is carried out with different levels of refinement grid resolution table 2 shows the details for four cases of mesh settings and the corresponding results of fr and fv for the numerical cases g1 to g4 as the number of meshes increases the values of fr and fv tend to stabilize for instance the differences between the results of g3 and g4 for fr and fv are only approximately 1 37 and 1 36 respectively indicating that the mesh number of g3 is sufficiently large to achieve satisfying simulation results and has mesh independence therefore the mesh setting of g3 is selected for the final calculation table 3 shows the details of four cases of time step settings and their results for fr and fv for the numerical cases t1 t4 the differences between the results of t3 and t4 for fr and fv are only approximately 0 75 and 1 29 respectively indicating that the time step of t3 is acceptable for achieving satisfying simulation results therefore the time step of t3 is selected for the final calculation so as to accurately capture the forces on the spheres and flow field information near the spheres 3 3 validation to validate the feasibility and accuracy of the numerical methods a comparison group of 30 cases is considered in the experiments the parameters are selected as θ 0 h 50 80 mm and v 1 m s 1 4 m s and 2 m s there is no spiral deflector inside the collecting pipe the numerical results are compared with those obtained by experiments as shown in fig 5 the tolerances between the measured and simulated values of the vertical force fv are less than 10 therefore the comparison validates the good feasibility and high accuracy of the numerical method for forecasting the forces on spheres in a suction flow field 4 design optimization of the spiral deflector the innovative concept of using spiral flow to collect nodules on the seabed is proposed based on the expectation that the spiral flow inside the pick up device will increase the suction forces as well as the probability of circular motion occurring on the nodules the basis for that conjecture is from observing and analyzing previous experiments zhao et al 2018b chen et al 2020 to generate the spiral flow inside the nodule pick up device a spiral deflector is designed and fixed inside the collecting pipe as shown in fig 6 as the figure shows two different nodule pick up devices i e with and without the spiral deflector are employed to conduct comparative research on the nodule collection characteristics as the spiral flow pattern is dominated by the surface profile of the deflector an optimization design for the deflector surface profiles is conducted based on numerical simulations the two key parameters of the spiral deflector are the helical angle α and side length l as shown in fig 6 the simulation cases are set up according to various combinations of these two design parameters including nine different l values and nine different α values as shown in table 4 the pitch for all spiral deflectors is 0 112 m and the number of turns is 1 the optimal parameters of l and α are determined by the magnitude of fv d 36 mm v 1 4 m s the influence of l on fv is shown in fig 7 with the helical angle α at 30 it is clear that fv reaches its maximum when l 30 mm with the relative growth of fv peaking at 8 46 as compared to the pick up device without the deflector the relative growth is defined as the increasing proportion of fv between the cases with and without the spiral deflector therefore l 30 mm is selected as a proper parameter for the spiral deflector the influence of α on fv is presented in fig 8 with the spiral deflector side length l 30 mm fv changes slightly when α 30 and then a remarkable decline can be observed when α 30 with the decrease of α the cross sectional area of the collecting pipe decreases and a larger cross sectional area inside the pipe can reduce collisions between the spiral deflector and spheres therefore α 30 and l 30 mm are selected as the proper parameters for the spiral deflector as a result the novel nodule pick up device with the spiral deflector l 30 mm α 30 can achieve a relative growth of fv of 8 46 relative to a device without the deflector 5 case design for comparative research for the comparative research on the performance characteristics of hydraulic collection based on the spiral flow principle five groups of cases are considered for collecting pipes both with and without the spiral deflector as shown in table 5 the spiral deflector used in the five groups of cases has the parameters α 30 and l 30 mm the value range of the parameters for the cases is properly determined by comparing the vertical force with the wet weight of the sphere particle in the collection flow field for engineering practice the fr and fv values of the sphere depend on the fluid density of water ρw 1000 kg m3 kinematic viscosity coefficient of water μ 1 3081 10 3 m2 s v d h and v as a result the functions of fv and fr are defined as follows 6 fv f h θ v ρw μ v d 7 fr f h θ v ρw μ v d case group i v 0 is denoted as the fixed suction tests and is designed to study the effects of h θ and v on fr and fv the positions of the collecting pipe and the sphere are fixed and there are 15 different v values 10 different θ values and 11 different h values during the test the experiments are conducted for cases with v 1 1 4 and 2 m s 0 05 m h 0 08 m and the results are used to validate the feasibility of the numerical method subsequently the other cases in group i are simulated using the numerical method case group ii v 0 is denoted as the moving suction tests in which the collecting pipe moves horizontally at constant v and h and fv and fr are measured each test case is repeated three times and the mean values are used so as to eradicate discrepancies in the experiments case group iii is denoted as the vertical incipient motion tests the values of h with different d values are recorded under v 0 and v 25 mm s each test case is repeated 10 times and the mean values are used to eradicate discrepancies to deepen our understanding about mechanism of the hydraulic collection the collection flow field is obtained by both experimental and numerical methods in case group iv in sea bed mining area the seafloor is covered with sediment case group v is carried out to compare the disturbance to the sediment caused by the collecting process with two different nodule pick up devices and denoted as the diffusion of sediment water mixture the results of the case are obtained numerically in the simulation a sphere with a diameter of 36 mm is fixed on the bottom and the bottom is covered with 10 mm thick sediment water mixture because the surface sediment is particularly fine and soft most particle sizes range from 0 001 to 0 05 mm the sediment water mixture on the surface layer of deep seabed is simplified as the fluid state with a density of 1400 kg m3 grupe et al 2001 droppo 2006 6 results and discussion a series of experiments and simulations are implemented according to the test cases described in table 5 the test results are demonstrated and analyzed below to illuminate the influences of several parameters on the force characteristics of the spheres under different circumstances for simplicity the cases in which the moving speed of collecting pipe is zero are termed as fixed collecting that is the pipe is fixed and the cases in which the moving speed of the pipe is non zero are termed as moving collecting in addition the cases without the spiral deflector are defined as non spiral flow cases whereas the cases with the spiral deflector are defined as spiral flow cases 6 1 suction forces in fixed collecting v 0 6 1 1 influence of h on fv when s 0 θ 0 the experimental results shown in fig 9 reveal the differences in the values of vertical force fv acting on the sphere under different bottom clearances h and flow velocities in the pipe v between the spiral and non spiral flow cases the fv values of the spiral flow cases tend to be greater than those of the corresponding non spiral cases this is more significant when h is smaller for example the force value of the spiral flow is 0 3675 n for a spiral flow case as compared to 0 2952 n for a non spiral flow showing an increase up to 24 49 when h 50 mm and v 1 0 m s as h increases the fv produced by spiral flow declines more significantly and the differences between the results of the spiral and non spiral flow cases become smaller 6 1 2 influence of h d on cv when s 0 θ 0 a dimensionless method is used to further analyze the result data the vertical force coefficient cv and radial force coefficient cr are defined in eqs 8 and 9 as follows 8 cv fvπ8ρwv2d2 9 cr frπ8ρwv2d2 fig 10 presents a comparison between the spiral and non spiral flow test cases in terms of the relationship between the logarithms of cv and h d it is clear that the ln cv in the spiral flow cases is always larger than that in non spiral flow cases with the decrease of h d the differences in cv become larger the ln cv are found to have a significant linear relationship with h d it indicates that cv decreases exponentially with increasing h d 1 428 h 2 285 the fitting formulae are obtained by analyzing the test results as shown in eqs 10 and 11 it is found that in the fitting formulae the absolute values of both the slope and intercept in the spiral flow cases are larger than those in the non spiral flow cases the formulae can be used as guidance for adjusting h to obtain proper suction forces at a constant v in engineering applications 10 lncv 2 5295 h d 2 9591 r2 0 9987 11 lncv 2 7247 h d 3 4285 r2 0 9972 6 1 3 influence of h d on cr and cv when s 36 mm to investigate the influence of h d on cr and cv in more general situations s is introduced and is defined as the distance between the center line of the collecting pipe and center of the sphere the simulation cases where this distance is equal to d are studied here for the cases s 36 mm θ increases with a decrease of h as shown in fig 11 the ln cr h d curves have characteristics similar to those in the ln cv h d curves in fig 10 with the increase of h d the ln cr in the spiral flow cases is always larger than that of the corresponding non spiral cases as h d decreases the differences in cr become larger a strong exponential relationship between cr and h d is also obtained the fitting formulae between ln cr and h d are shown in eqs 12 and 13 12 lncr 2 993 h d 2 608 r2 0 9992 13 lncr 3 026 h d 2 579 r2 0 9991 as the position of the sphere deviates from the center line of the collecting pipe s 0 the cv h d curve in fig 12 shows curve characteristics that are different from those in fig 10 when h d 1 55 the ln cv values in the spiral flow and non spiral flow cases are almost equal when h d 1 55 the ln cv values in the spiral flow cases are slightly smaller than those in non spiral flow cases this is owing to the characteristics of the spiral flow field as the low pressure area is more concentrated along the axis of the collecting pipe as h d decreases θ increases therefore the enhancement effect of fv in the spiral flow will disappear when θ is beyond a certain value the influence of θ on fv will be fully discussed in the next section the similarity between the cases s 0 and s 36 mm is that the cv values in both the spiral and non spiral flow cases are found to have a significant exponential relationship with h d the fitting formulae are obtained as shown in eqs 14 and 15 for the novel nodule pick up device based on spiral flow principle the collection performance prediction could be based on the strong functional relationships among key parameter variables 14 lncv 2 804 h d 3 137 r2 0 9966 15 lncv 2 774 h d 3 060 r2 0 9965 6 1 4 influence of θ on cr and cv the forces acting on the sphere under 10 different θ values in spiral and non spiral flows are calculated by the numerical method and then comparatively analyzed as shown in fig 13 the cr θ curve does not include the results of θ 0 and θ 5 as the average value of cr tends to zero the enhancement effect of cr in the spiral flow can be seen from fig 13 where cr is larger in the spiral flow than in the non spiral flow when 10 θ 45 for the case h d 1 4583 θ 20 the cr value in the spiral flow is 22 7 larger than that in the non spiral flow for both spiral and non spiral flow cases cr increases first and then decreases and reaches its maximum value at θ 40 as to the cv θ curve shown in fig 14 a phenomenon is observed i e the enhancement effect of cv in the spiral flow is greatly influenced by θ when θ 20 the cv in the spiral flow is larger than that in the non spiral flow with the biggest relative growth of 11 3 in the case θ 0 h d 1 5278 with an increase of θ the differences between cv values in the spiral and non spiral flows become smaller the cv values in spiral flow cases are very close to those in non spiral flow cases when θ 20 and slightly smaller than that in non spiral flow cases when 30 θ 45 this is because the low pressure area is more concentrated in the spiral flow field as θ increases the low pressure area under the collecting pipe would have an enhancement effect on cr in the range 10 θ 45 and on cv in the range 0 θ 20 for both spiral and non spiral flow cases cv decreases at an increasing rate for environmentally friendly nodules mining near the seabed a proper suction force will allow the nodules to be lifted precisely indicating that the suction force acting on the nodule is neither too big nor too small there are many benefits to precise nodule lifting such as steady nodule pick up efficiency minimization of sediment disruption and lower energy consumption the collection process for nodules could be described as follows at the start the nodules move horizontally to the center line of the pipe under fr with θ decreasing and fv increasing then the nodules are sucked into the collecting pipe when fv increases to a certain value i e larger than their weights in seawater the characteristics of the collection method based on spiral flow can be beneficial in that process as the enhancement effect on fr will assist in moving nodules towards the pipe to be sucked into the pipe under larger fv through a comprehensive analysis of results in figs 10 14 it is found that 1 with a decrease of h d the differences in the results between spiral and non spiral flows have an increasing tendency 2 for both spiral and non spiral flow cases the ln cr h d and ln cv h d curves have the common characteristics e g ln cr and ln cv increase linearly as h d increases and 3 the cr values in spiral flow cases are always larger than those in non spiral flow cases the maximum enhancement value for cr is up to 22 7 in the case h d 1 4583 θ 20 the cv in the spiral flow cases is larger when θ 20 and slightly smaller when θ 30 the maximum enhancement value for cv is up to 11 3 in the case h d 1 5278 θ 0 by comparing the results in the spiral flow and non spiral flow cases the mechanisms of the suction force enhancement in the spiral flow are analyzed 6 1 5 influence of re on cr and cv to study the impacts of v on fr and fv in spiral and non spiral flows 15 different v values are used ranging from 0 8 to 2 2 m s in intervals of 0 1 m s in numerical simulations as shown in fig 15 fr and fv increase linearly with v2 and the fitting formulas are shown in the figure the reynolds number re is defined in eq 16 as follows 16 re ρwvdμ the v used in the definition of re is the average velocity in collecting pipe inlet rather than the velocity around the particle fig 16 shows the results of cv and cr for different re at h d 1 5278 and θ 25 it can be seen that the force coefficients are nearly independent of re this feature could provide guidance for adjusting v to obtain proper suction forces in engineering applications 6 2 collection flow field in the case h 60 mm v 1 4 m s d 36 mm v 0 6 2 1 collection flow field without sediment water mixture the velocity vectors and velocity distribution in non spiral and spiral flows measured by the piv system are shown in fig 17 the numerical results of the collection flow field are shown in fig 18 by comparing the velocity distributions in fig 18 c d and 17 a b it is found that the numerical results match well with those measured by piv system in both non spiral and spiral flow cases vf are large near the top part of the sphere but are small at the bottom half this velocity distribution is beneficial for achieving a larger suction force as well as ensuring smaller disturbances to the seabed meanwhile vf always achieves its maximum near the axial line of the collecting pipe the maximum of vf is approximately twice as big as the average velocity v in collecting pipe inlet in non spiral flow and three times in spiral flow in the region outside of the collecting pipe vf increases as the fluid particle approaches the pipe inlet fig 18 c indicates that the pressure distribution is approximately symmetric along the axis in the non spiral flow but it is asymmetric in the spiral flow case due to the arrangement of the spiral deflector a tubular vortex region near the top of the sphere is observed as shown in fig 18 d therefore the effect that fv is always larger in the spiral flow cases can be explained that the localized low pressure area near the top of the sphere can increase its vertical pressure difference the distributions of vf at the line 10 mm below the pipe inlet x 0 150 y 150 mm z 50 mm in non spiral and spiral flow cases are quantitatively analyzed as shown in fig 19 it is verified that the collection flow field prediction based on numerical simulation is feasible by comparing the vf y curves with the measurements the value vf always achieves its local maximum at y 50 mm and reaches its local minimum at y 0 those curves are approximately symmetric along the line y 0 in the non spiral flow case whereas asymmetric at 50 y 50 mm in the spiral flow case 6 2 2 collection flow field with sediment water mixture the surface layer of deep seabed will be modified by the collecting process of manganese nodules surface sediments are mechanically disturbed with a cloud of sediment particles suspended and redeposited to compare the disturbance to the sediment water mixture caused by the collecting process with two different nodule pick up devices the diffusion of sediment water mixture within 0 5 s after the launching of the two devices are calculated and compared to each other fig 20 and 21 show the time evolution of volume fraction of sediment water mixture in non spiral flow and spiral flow sediment water mixture are sucked into the collecting pipe from the bottom meanwhile there is no diffusion of mixture outside the collecting pipe in the two cases which is beneficial to ensure the performance of various sensors e g distance sensors imaging sensors near the collecting pipe in sediment water mixture tests no significant difference in diffusion degree can been observed comparing to the non spiral flow case the profile of sediment diffusion gradually gets more concentrated in the spiral flow case this difference is caused by the spiral flow inside the collecting pipe the volume fraction of sediment water mixture along the horizontal line at the collecting pipe inlet x 0 z h 60 mm 50 y 50 mm when t 0 5 s are analyzed as shown in fig 22 the curves in the figure are approximately symmetric along the line y 0 and the left half of the curves 50 y 0 mm can be divided into three regions according to their trends in region i 50 y 25 mm the volume fraction of mixture is almost 0 as y increases the volume fraction increases approximately linearly in region ii 25 y 7 5 mm and get close to 1 in region iii 7 5 y 0 mm the volume fraction is almost constant with the value of 1 the figure shows that the volume of sediment water mixture is sucked a little bigger in the non spiral flow than that in the spiral flow this means that for the cases with the same v forces on sphere are bigger in spiral flow case while the flow field disturbance near the seabed is slightly smaller the spiral flow pick up device shows advantage in reducing disturbance to sediment water mixture when generating the equal suction forces on the nodules 6 3 suction forces in moving collecting v 0 with the low horizontal moving speed v 2 5 mm s of the collecting pipe in the experiments fig 23 presents a comparison of cr and cv in spiral and non spiral flow cases under two different values of h d the cr θ curve in fig 23 a b shows that 1 as the collecting pipe moves from one side to the other at a constant horizontal moving speed of 2 5 mm s the cr values in both the spiral and non spiral cases first increase to a maximum value at θ 40 45 and then decrease reaching a minimum close to 0 at θ 0 and the cr θ curve is almost symmetrical in terms of the point θ 0 2 the cr value in the spiral flow cases is larger than that in the non spiral flow cases and with an increase of h d the differences between the spiral and non spiral flow cases become smaller the maximum values of the relative growth of cr in the spiral flow cases are 28 57 at h d 1 4583 and 18 18 at h d 1 5278 relative to the non spiral flow cases and 3 when θ 50 the values of cr in the spiral and non spiral flow cases are almost equal the cv θ curve in fig 23 c and d shows that 1 for both spiral and non spiral flow cases as the collecting pipe moves from one side to the other cv increases first and then decreases and the cv θ curve is approximately symmetrical with the line θ 0 moreover cv always reaches the maximum and fluctuates slightly when θ 20 2 the cv value in spiral flow cases is larger than that in non spiral flow cases and the difference is more significant as collecting pipe moves closer to the sphere the maximum value in the spiral flow cases has an increase of up to 23 08 at h d 1 4583 and to 18 75 at h d 1 5278 relative to non spiral flow cases when θ 40 the cv values are almost equal in the spiral and non spiral flow cases to investigate the influence of the horizontal moving speed v on the force characteristics of the spheres comparisons of cr and cv between spiral and non spiral flow cases under two different h d values and seven different v values are presented in fig 24 25 respectively the cr θ curves shown in fig 24 illustrate that 1 for spiral and non spiral cases with different values of v cr cv always reaches the maximum value when the value of θ is close to 40 and when 0 θ 25 as v increases cr tends to be larger 2 the cr values in spiral flow cases are larger than those in non spiral flow cases crmax and cvmax shown in figs 24 25 are denoted as the maximum value of the cr and cv respectively crmax in the spiral flow cases has an increase up to 7 81 when h d is 1 4583 and to 6 02 when h d is 1 5278 as can be seen from fig 25 1 cv always changes slowly and reaches the maximum value when θ 20 additionally cv is not susceptible to changes of v when 20 θ 60 2 cv in spiral flow cases is larger than that in non spiral flow cases the maximum value of cvmax the spiral flow cases shows an increase of up to 19 31 when h d is 1 4583 and up to 21 04 when h d is 1 5278 6 4 vertical incipient motions vertical incipient motion tests are conducted to measure the critical bottom clearance h which is another aspect for evaluating the collection performance besides the suction forces in addition the motion characteristics of the spheres in the process of being lifted are investigated to verify a conjecture i e that there will be a bigger probability of the circular motion of the spheres in the spiral flow cases than in the non spiral flow cases during the process of the spheres being lifted into the collecting pipe circular motion can be observed in both the spiral flow and non spiral flow cases the trajectories of the spheres are recorded and analyzed to study the trajectory behavior in the collection process by observing pictures taken by a high speed camera it is found that in some cases the sphere is lifted vertically with little side deviation as shown in fig 26 a and c whereas in other cases the sphere is in circular motion before being lifted the spiral like trajectories are drawn as shown in fig 26 b and d the cases with circular motions are underlined as shown in table 6 a and 6 b it is found that the existence of the spiral deflector can remarkably increase the probability of the circular motion of the spheres the probability of occurrence of the circular motion of the spheres when using the spiral deflector is 72 5 in cases with v 0 and 90 0 in cases with v 25 mm s whereas this probability for a collecting pipe without spiral deflector is only 22 5 in cases with v 0 and 37 5 in cases with v 25 mm s the probability of circular motion for a sphere being picked up by the pick up device with the spiral deflector is 3 22 times higher than that without spiral deflector in cases with v 0 and 2 4 times higher in cases with v 25 mm s in addition it is found that the horizontal moving speed of the collecting pipe has a positive impact on increasing this probability with an increase of v the occurrence probability has an increase up to 66 67 in spiral flow cases and 24 14 in non spiral flow cases this indicates that the spiral suction flow can significantly increase the probability of the circular motion of the spheres and enhance the positive effect between the horizontal moving speed and the probability as shown in tables 6 a and 6 b the critical bottom clearances h under spiral and non spiral flow cases where v 0 and v 25 mm s are measured and analyzed h represents the value of the bottom clearance h when the vertical incipient motion of the spheres occurs in the collection tests with the spheres being freely placed on the bottom ground four different sizes of spheres based on d are selected in the tests namely 40 mm 36 mm 32 mm and 30 mm denoted as d40 d36 d32 and d30 respectively each of the test cases is repeated 10 times and each h is recorded as hi i 1 2 10 then the mean value h and standard deviation are calculated the critical bottom clearance h is always larger in cases where the spheres are in circular motion when being lifted as can be concluded from both the spiral and non spiral flow cases in d30 cases the mean value h in the spiral flow cases has an increase up to 6 50 where v 0 and to 5 24 where v 25 mm s this phenomenon could be explained by assuming that the circular motion of spheres is generated by the vortex near the center line of the collecting pipe this vortex could effectively increase the suction forces on the spheres compared with a non spiral flow a more concentrated low pressure area near the collecting pipe inlet could provide centripetal force to the spheres and significantly increase the probability of the circular motion of the spheres it is clear that in both spiral and non spiral flow cases the h values for the spheres of the four different d values in cases where v 0 are smaller than those in cases where v 25 mm s this could be explained by the relative motion between the collecting pipe and sphere forming a convection zone near the sphere increasing the suction force the small standard deviation for the spiral and non spiral flow cases shows that the test results have low fluctuation and high repeatability and are therefore stable and reliable meanwhile the mean value of h for the four differently sized spheres in the spiral flow cases is larger than that in the non spiral flow cases there may be two reasons for this result one is that the enhancement effect on fr and fv in the spiral flow as demonstrated by suction force tests the sphere is fixed on the force sensor can help increase the value of h another is that the movement of spheres in the spiral flow cases is usually greater and faster which could increase the local flow velocity near the sphere and thus increase the fr and fv the feasibility and beneficial effects of this innovative design i e using spiral flow to collect nodules are verified by the critical bottom clearance measurements the reduction in v requirements during the hydraulic collection process could not only reduce energy consumption but could also minimize flow field disturbances near the seabed 7 conclusions a novel type of nodule pick up device based on the spiral flow principle is proposed and verified for hydraulic collection the spiral flow in the pick up device is induced by a spiral deflector arranged on the inner wall of the pipe and the design is optimized through a verified and validated numerical method a piv system is used to acquire detailed data regarding the collection flow field to investigate the differences and similarities in collection performance between pick up devices with and without spiral deflectors five types of cases are implemented the results prove that the pick up device using the spiral flow principle can achieve enhanced suction forces on the nodules an increased h when v is constant as well as a significantly increased occurrence probability of the circular motion of nodules the nodule pick up device with the spiral deflector has beneficial effects in regard to the enhancement of suction forces under certain conditions for fixed suction cases the pick up device with the spiral deflector can produce a larger vertical force coefficient cv when θ 20 and a larger radial force coefficient cr when 10 θ 45 as compared to the pick up device without the spiral deflector with a decrease of h d the differences in the cv and cr values between the spiral and non spiral flow cases increase for the moving suction cases the maximum value of the relative growth of cr in the spiral flow is 28 57 and that of cv is 23 08 when h d is 1 4583 compared to the non spiral flow cases it is validated that the prediction of suction forces and collection flow filed characteristics based on numerical simulation is feasible a tubular vortex region near the top of the sphere is observed in the spiral flow case the localized low pressure area near the top of the sphere can increase its vertical pressure difference so as to enhance the suction force on the sphere the volume fraction of mixture at the collecting pipe inlet in non spiral flow is slightly bigger than that in spiral flow under the same v i e the spiral flow pick up device shows advantage in reducing disturbance to sediment water mixture when generating equal suction forces in the vertical incipient motion tests a phenomenon is observed that a sphere moving in a circular motion before being lifted always has a larger h with careful analysis of the test statistics it is determined that the occurrence probability of the circular motion of the sphere for the pick up device with the spiral deflector is 3 22 times higher than that without the spiral deflector in cases where v 0 and 2 4 times higher in cases where v 25 mm s with an increase of v the occurrence probability has an increase up to 66 67 in spiral flow cases and 24 14 in non spiral flow cases this indicates that the spiral suction flow can offer significant improvements in the probability of the circular motion of the spheres and enhance the positive effect between the horizontal moving speed and the probability the critical bottom clearance h is measured when the vertical incipient motion of the spheres occurs before being sucked into the pick up device the pick up device with the spiral deflector always has a larger h as compared to non spiral cases with identical conditions in d30 cases the mean value h in the spiral flow cases has an increase up to 6 50 where v 0 and to 5 24 where v 25 mm s it also means that in cases with a constant h a smaller v is required to lift the nodules from the seabed there are also some similarities in collection performance in the spiral and non spiral flow cases it is found that c v has a significant exponential relationship with h d h d 1 39 2 22 and is nearly independent of the reynolds number r e ranging from 22 000 to 60 500 the c r always reaches a maximum when 40 θ 45 whereas c v always reaches the peak when θ 20 when θ 25 as v increases c r tends to be larger c v is not susceptible to changes of v when 20 θ 60 in addition it is found the horizontal moving speed of the collecting pipe has a positive impact on increasing the occurrence probability these features can be applied to build collection performance prediction models for achieving precise nodule collection and obtaining an optimal balance among the nodule collection rate energy consumption and sediment disruption the results of this study will serve to further the understanding of the mechanisms of hydraulic collection and provide reference for conceptual design of key

20921,the deployment of tidal turbines requires a precise hydrodynamic characterisation of the production site acoustic doppler current profilers adcp usually employed for measuring the time mean characteristics of environmental flows could also be used for assessing the main features of turbulence adcp measurements are sensitive to many sources of uncertainties associated mainly with the spreading of the beams or the assumptions made on flow homogeneity the ability of adcps to accurately measure the hydrodynamic parameters of a given flow can be tested on a synthetic dataset however it is difficult to generate a dataset representative of a real environmental flow in this work large eddy simulation of a high reynolds flow over a rough seabed is performed and used to assess the accuracy of two coupled 4 beam adcp systems forming an 8 beam arrangement the study confirms the relevance and efficiency of the tested 8 beam configuration for the characterisation of turbulence the results near the seabed are of a lower quality with up to 50 error on the reynolds stresses for elevations under twice the roughness height which questions the interpretation of adcp measurements in the lower part of the water column also the spatial averaging over adcp cells leads to an underestimation of the turbulence intensity of 10 to 20 keywords turbulence lattice boltzmann method large

tidal turbines thiébaut et al 2020b milne et al 2016 and impacts turbine wakes grondeau et al 2019 its characterisation is essential milne et al 2016 the power production is stable over long periods of time lewis et al 2019 however turbulence might generate electrical surges that need to be anticipated to preserve the power system several large eddy simulations les have been performed such as zangiabadi et al 2015 in the ramsey sound bourgoin et al 2020 and mercier et al 2020a in the raz blanchard and le et al 2018 in the mississippi river these simulations enable the assessment of turbulence metrics such as the full reynolds tensor but are limited in resolution temporal and spatial coverage in situ measurements are widely used to estimate the local turbulence metrics thomson et al 2010 bottom mounted acoustic doppler current profilers adcps are commonly used for flow characterisation in situations where simultaneous velocity measurements are desired throughout the water column to investigate the vertical distribution of the current velocities adcps use the doppler shift in the echoes of a pulsed signal along directed acoustic diverging beams to estimate flow velocities such sensors can be deployed in various environments such as oceans rivers or estuaries and for long intervals of time several months allowing for an assessment of the flow variability over a wide range of time scales with a typical sampling frequency of a few hertz they can be employed for an extensive range of applications and especially for turbulence characterisation mcmillan et al 2016 guerra et al 2017 thiébaut et al 2020a velocity fluctuations derived from adcp measurements enable the quantification of several characteristics of the turbulent kinetic energy tke budget such as the tke dissipation and tke production rate as well as the diffusive transport term thiébaut et al 2020c the use of 4 beam adcps for turbulence characterisation gained popularity since lohrmann et al 1990 introduced the so called variance method with this technique profiles with two components out of six of the reynolds stress tensor are estimated from along beam velocity measurements using the difference between the velocity variances along opposing beams lu and lueck 1999 stacey et al 1999 rippeth et al 2003 in comparison to 4 beam adcps 5 beam adcps allow for a true measurement of vertical velocities and the estimation of five components of the reynolds stress tensor guerra et al 2017 and reduce wave disturbances togneri et al 2017a recently 7 beam adcps have emerged droniou et al 2019 enabling the full reynolds stress tensor to be solved but they still require development and validation a valuable alternative to 7 beam adcps for fully resolving the reynolds stress tensor is the combination of two 4 beam adcps vermeulen et al 2011 the data from the eight beams allow the six components of the tensor to be resolved recently this method has been implemented to coupled adcp measurements performed in the goulet de brest france pieterse et al 2017 and in the raz blanchard thiébaut et al 2020c b one of the main limitations of adcps when it comes to turbulence characterisation is the assumption of the homogeneity of the flow field over the measurement volume indeed such sensors use beams that diverge away from the sensor hence the volume in which the flow is assumed homogeneous and in which the measurements are being integrated increases changing the spatial averaging of the flow characteristics although this homogeneity assumption is widely applied its validity is likely to fail in particular flow conditions an analytical study of the adcp functioning allows to assess their limits guion and young 2014 however such an analysis does not take into account the specificity of a realistic flow field and in particular the potential spatial variability of the flow characteristics the validity of adcp data processing can be assessed through virtual adcp v adcp methods which consists in applying adcp data processing to a controlled flow field generated analytically crossley et al 2017 or by numerical simulation tokyay et al 2009 richmond et al 2015 the velocity field should be representative of the studied environmental flow in particular the impact of realistic rough seabed morphology on the turbulent characteristics and on the related accuracy of the data processing method has not to the authors knowledge been addressed yet the seabed roughness is known to impact the flow characteristics hama 1954 schlichting 1979 schindler and ackerman 2010 the structure of flows over a rough seabed is characterised by a rough sub layer in which individual roughness wakes induce three dimensional variations in the flow characteristics the thickness of this layer is typically two to five time the roughness height nikuradse 1950 perry et al 1969 in such a way that in high seabed roughness areas adcp measurement validity could be questioned in a large part of the water column a specific study of the rough sub layer and its impact on adcp measurement accuracy in typical tidal power flows is thus necessary the structure of environmental flows can be addressed through canopy flow studies in which roughness is represented by macro roughness distributions uniform distributions of wall mounted cubes have been investigated experimentally by florens et al 2013 basley et al 2019 and numerically by coceal et al 2007 and anderson et al 2015 hardy et al 2016 and jiang and liu 2018 also performed experimental and numerical analyses of flows over a pebble bed ikhennicheu et al 2018 2019 2020 and mercier et al 2020b experimentally and numerically investigated the flow over combinations of real seabed elements such as big rocks or abrupt changes of seabed elevation however these studies are limited to moderate reynolds numbers r e 1 0 6 which is not representative of flows at tidal energy sites r e 1 0 8 to conduct numerical simulations at high reynolds number the choice of the numerical method is crucial to handle large and complex simulation domains the lattice boltzmann method lbm is an unsteady computational fluid dynamic method based on the resolution of the boltzmann equation bhatnagar et al 1954 qian et al 1992 it is well suited to large and complex geometries succi et al 1989 and can be combined with les smagorinsky 1963 eggels and somers 1995 in order to resolve a large part of the turbulence energy spectrum and to investigate the motion of the largest eddies sagaut 2006 those that contain most of the turbulent energy and control most of the momentum transfer and turbulent mixing for these reasons lbm les has been used for environmental numerical simulations parmigiani 2013 mercier et al 2020a here lbm les is chosen to perform a simulation of a channel flow over a uniform distribution of wall mounted cubes designed to be representative of a tidal energy site the v adcp method is performed on the simulation output to test the accuracy of the adcp configuration proposed by vermeulen et al 2011 firstly the numerical simulation method is presented as well as the adcp configuration and principles of the v adcp method then the simulation results are exploited to investigate the sources of error finally the prospects and limits of the method are discussed 2 methods 2 1 numerical flow simulation simulations are performed with the lbm bhatnagar et al 1954 qian et al 1992 a full description of which can be found in guo and shu 2013 the code is based on palabos a c library latt et al 2020 les relies on the static smagorinsky model smagorinsky 1963 with a smagorinsky constant of 0 14 the discretisation scheme is d3q19 and the collision operator relies on the work of latt and chopard 2006 a no slip boundary condition is used at the seabed based on the work of bouzidi et al 2001 periodic boundary conditions are applied at the longitudinal and lateral boundaries a free slip boundary condition is applied at the water surface position the simulation domain is 320 m long 80 m wide and 40 m deep the seabed is composed of 3 m large cubic elements disposed regularly over the bottom see fig 1 this macro roughness aims at generating a vertical variation of the turbulence intensity similar to that measured with two coupled 4 beam adcps in the raz blanchard thiébaut et al 2020b where the mean vertical profile of longitudinal turbulence intensity ranged from 12 near the surface to 21 near the adcps at the seabed as the domain is periodic the load losses tend to decrease the flow velocity this effect is offset by a longitudinal volume force that sustains the flow the time step is 0 010 s the mesh resolution is 0 21 m near the seabed and 0 42 m near the water surface the domain contains 28 3 million cells the average longitudinal speed is 3 m s 1 for a volume force corresponding to a 2 5 10 3 m s 2 acceleration the instantaneous longitudinal velocity along a vertical longitudinal plane is shown in fig 2 the simulation ran on 56 processors for 78 h the total simulated time is 52 min with a convergence period of 36 min for in situ measurements the period of data extraction must be long enough to guarantee a sufficient number of samples and short enough not to be affected by changes in the hydrodynamic conditions relative to the tidal cycle this condition is satisfied by using a 10 min period in the case studied in the work of thiébaut et al 2020b here as there is no variation in the hydrodynamic conditions the period is extended to 16 min longitudinal lateral and vertical velocity components are respectively referred to as u v and w acting in the x y and z directions herein time averaged u and time fluctuating u velocities are defined in such way that u u u 2 2 virtual adcps in the present work the two coupled 4 beam adcp configuration designed by vermeulen et al 2011 is tested this configuration is specially conceived for turbulence measurements its working principle is described hereinafter the v adcps are modelled to represent the sampling geometry of the coupled adcps in the representative velocity field derived from the numerical flow simulation two upward looking 4 beam v adcps coupled in a master slave set up are positioned on the seabed forming an 8 beam arrangement where the beams are numbered from 1 to 8 fig 3 the two v adcps are at a distance of 0 5 m from each other the v adcps record alternatively the velocities in beam coordinates radial velocities at the frequency rate of 2 hz the angle θ between the transducers and the vertical is 20 in accordance with the 4 beam adcps used in vermeulen et al 2011 and thiébaut et al 2020c b a cartesian coordinate system o x y z is defined relative to the master v adcp with the origin o located at the centre of the four transducers fig 3 the orientation of the master v adcp is such that the opposite beams 1 and 2 are oriented along the direction of the longitudinal velocity u defining the x axis whereas beams 3 and 4 are oriented along the direction of the lateral velocity v defining the y axis the slave v adcp is rotated to an angle ϕ 1 20 around the x axis fig 3 and ϕ 3 45 around the z axis resulting in a tilted v adcp with one beam pointed vertically upward fig 4 no rotation is applied around the y axis ϕ 2 0 the coupled adcp method developed by vermeulen et al 2011 combines i the traditional transformation method where two opposite beams of the adcp are used to transform velocities in beam coordinates to velocities in cartesian coordinates with ii the rotation of the slave relative to the master adcp the velocities in beam coordinates equates to the velocities u v w in cartesian coordinates as in eq 1 1 b t u where b is an eight component vector containing all the radial velocity components from the two coupled adcps u is the velocity vector in the cartesian coordinate system u u e x v e y w e z and t is the transformation matrix involving sines and cosines of θ ϕ 1 ϕ 2 and ϕ 3 vermeulen et al 2011 thiébaut et al 2020c b the velocities in the cartesian coordinate system are obtained by inverting the transformation matrix t in order to obtain the components of the reynolds stress tensor from the velocity variances in beam coordinates a new eight by six matrix q is computed resulting from the product of the terms in t vermeulen et al 2011 thiébaut et al 2020c b the vector v b containing the velocity variances in beam coordinates is written as the product of q by the vector r containing the six terms of the reynolds stress tensor as in eq 2 2 v b q r the six element vector r can be rearranged to form the reynolds stress tensor according to eq 3 3 r r 1 r 4 r 5 r 4 r 2 r 6 r 5 r 6 r 3 u 2 u v u w u v v 2 v w u w v w w 2 the reynolds stresses indicate the orientation of the eddies in the flow and are often used to estimate fundamental turbulence metrics such as the turbulence intensity the tke dissipation rate or the tke production rate here the u u v v and w w components will be referred to as normal stresses and the u v u w and v w components as the shear stresses v adcp cells are defined by all the mesh nodes included in a volume delimited by a frustum of 4 beam cone the cells of the master and slave v adcp are respectively 1 28 m and 1 37 m thick this corresponds to the configuration used in thiébaut et al 2020c the cells are presented in fig 4 they are composed of a number of mesh nodes ranging from 4 to 135 and their volume ranges from 0 5 m3 to 17 m 3 depending on their elevation similarly to real adcps the spatial averaging of the radial velocity is performed on each cell volume this process is replicated on each v adcp beam the issue of doppler noise brumley et al 1991 and other practical operational considerations are ignored also if the acquisition frequency affects the consideration of the smallest scales of the turbulence in standard adcp uses guion and young 2014 it is not the case for data processing based on the variance method thus this matter is not addressed here the reynolds stresses are computed directly from the synthetic flow field on a vertical profile centred on the master v adcp position with a high frequency data acquisition 100 hz this dataset will be referred to as the reference dataset simultaneously the reynolds stresses are calculated from the velocities recorded by the v adcp the comparison between reynolds stresses derived from both methods will allow for the assessment of the error inherent to adcp measurements 3 results 3 1 comparison of reynolds stresses derived from the reference dataset and v adcp fig 5 shows scatterplots of the six components of the reynolds stress tensor derived from the reference dataset and the v adcp at each cell elevation the 1 1 black line indicates perfect agreement between reynolds stresses derived from both methods in general a good agreement is found with the u u v v w w u v and u w components matching the 1 1 line however a few values are found to be significantly far from the 1 1 line especially in the normal stresses u u and v v where these values were calculated near the seabed moreover the component v v exhibits some inconsistencies with two negative values derived from the v adcp the scatterplots of the normal stresses u u v v and w w are slightly right skewed indicating that the v adcp underestimates these components since the normal stresses allow for the calculation of the turbulence intensity it is expected that the v adcp gives underestimated values of this metric moreover the shear stress v w is characterised by very low absolute values this is imputed to the symmetric characteristic of the domain the domain symmetry should imply that the u v component also satisfies this condition which is not the case vertical profiles of the reynolds stresses are shown in fig 6 this figure exhibits a good agreement between profiles derived from the reference dataset and v adcp the absolute error is greater near the seabed which could result from spatial heterogeneity of the flow over a horizontal plane that invalidates the homogeneity assumption this assumption is necessary for the application of the method proposed by vermeulen et al 2011 section 2 2 however as demonstrated by nikuradse 1950 and perry et al 1969 this assumption is true for elevations above 2 to 5 times the roughness height therefore it may not be valid in the lower part of the water column which induces high error this is consistent with the high absolute error observed here up to 8 m above the seabed the maximum relative error maxerror eq 4 and the root mean square error rmse eq 5 between the reynolds stresses derived from the reference dataset and the v adcp are shown in table 1 only values calculated at a height above seabed higher than 8 m are taken into account the maximum rmse is associated with the shear stress v w with a value of 137 this high value is not troublesome as the v w component is centred on zero the rmse of the five other components of the reynolds stress tensor is relatively low with values ranging from 8 to 14 and up to 33 for u v the maximum relative error varies over a wide range with the three components u u v v and w w associated with maximum relative error lower than 27 whereas the u v and u w components exhibit maximum values of 91 and 34 respectively the component v w reveals considerable maximum error reaching 353 which is once again explained by the fact that the v w component is centred on zero 4 maxerror x 100 max x r e f x v a d c p max x r e f 5 rmse x 100 ω x r e f x v a d c p 2 l d ω max x r e f 3 2 assessment of turbulence homogeneity over the beams the operating principle of the coupled 4 beam adcp system requires the inherent assumption of homogeneity in the flow within the sampled area the reference dataset computed from the synthetic flow field allows for the direct determination of the vertical evolution of the reynolds stresses along each beam of the v adcps fig 7 it is thus possible to perform a turbulence homogeneity test over the beams fig 7 shows that for a given component of the reynolds stress tensor the profiles derived from each v adcp beam have the same behaviour their magnitude increases abruptly up to an elevation of 8 10 m and decreases above 10 m up to the maximum elevation the only component that confirms the turbulence homogeneity assumption throughout the water column is the normal stress w w for the components v v and u w the assumption is not valid for elevations higher than 15 m and 20 m respectively the normal stress u u reveals two ranges in elevation where the homogeneity assumption may be validated i from 0 to 8 m and ii from 20 to 38 m the maximum elevation between both layers the reynolds stress profiles can be split into three groups of beams the first group is composed of beams 1 2 5 and 7 where these beams are aligned with the flow direction in this direction the turbulence is homogeneous and rapidly advected the second group is composed of beams 4 6 and 8 whose associated profiles exhibit similar behaviour these beams share the same three dimensional spanning area fig 4 thus as expected these beams capture comparable turbulence processes beam 3 spans a different area and constitutes the last group this decomposition in three groups is particularly noticeable for the component u v throughout the water column fig 8a shows the vertical profiles of the reynolds stresses derived from the reference dataset and averaged over the 8 beams the profiles used to calculate and normalise the average gap between individual and spatially averaged beams are represented in fig 8b for u u v v w w and u w components the discrepancies are high in the lower part of the water column up to 10 m low in the medium part of the water column and increase between 20 m and the maximum elevation for u v and v w the same tendency is observed but with higher magnitudes the origin of the discrepancies in the lower part of the water column can be explained by the presence of seabed roughness that is expected to affect the homogeneity of the flow up to 2 to 5 times its height 6 m to 15 m discrepancies observed in the upper part of the water column could be explained by increasing distance between v adcp beams potentially reducing the validity of the assumption made on the horizontal homogeneity of the flow 3 3 effect of spatial averaging inside v adcp cells similarly to real adcps the velocities derived from the v adcps were averaged over each bin cell volume this spatial averaging is expected to filter small eddies thus affecting the evaluation of turbulence metrics this filtering effect can be assessed through numerical simulation because the full velocity vector is accessible at a high spatial resolution in order to investigate the potential filtering induced biases when characterising turbulence the reference dataset extracted from individual simulation nodes are compared to the data averaged over each cell of the 7th beam of the v adcps fig 9 this beam is oriented vertically upward and matches the position of the vertical reference profile the vertical evolution of the reynolds stresses derived from both the reference dataset and the v adcps are similar however the v adcp data significantly and systematically underestimates the magnitude of the reynolds stresses especially for the normal stresses this result is in agreement with the right skewed distribution of the scatterplots associated with the normal stresses presented in fig 5 for each component the difference is more significant in the lower part of the water column and ranges from 10 to 20 4 conclusion in this study the ability of a coupled 4 beam adcp system to characterise the six components of the reynolds stress tensor is assessed les of high reynolds flow over a rough bed is performed in order to build a reference synthetic dataset used to directly estimate the reynolds stresses the coupled adcp system v adcp is assumed to be located on the seabed measuring the along beam velocities of the synthetic flow vermeulen et al 2011 the reynolds stresses derived from the v adcps are estimated following the methodology proposed by thiébaut et al 2020c b comparison between reynolds stresses derived from both the reference dataset and the v adcps are generally in good agreement the flow heterogeneity over the adcp beams and the spatial averaging over adcp cells are found to be the two main sources of error in the interpretation of adcp measurements flow heterogeneity is observed in the lower part of the water column where the seabed roughness wakes have a local influence on the turbulence metrics it is significant up to twice the roughness height 6 m this leads to high discrepancies between v adcp and reference results as a consequence adcp measurements should be interpreted with caution near the seabed in the case of a high seabed roughness flow heterogeneity is also observed in the upper part of the water column where the distance between beams increases the heterogeneity is observed in the lateral direction and not in the longitudinal direction indeed the transport of turbulence characteristics in the longitudinal direction is expected to be faster than its diffusion in the lateral direction resulting in a higher homogeneity in the longitudinal direction than in the lateral direction however this heterogeneity is expected to have a minor effect on the accuracy of the measurements since reynolds stresses derived from the reference dataset and the v adcps are found to be consistent the spatial averaging over the cells in the numerical model is found to underestimate the reynolds stresses by 10 to 20 in particular the normal components which are used to estimate the turbulence intensity the spatial averaging is performed to simulate the working principle of a real adcp however for this type of sensor the averaging is not uniform over the cells instead the cells are most sensitive to velocities at their centre and least sensitive at the edges the velocity in each depth cell is a weighted average using a triangular weighting function this is not considered in the present study these insights could help reducing uncertainties and systematic bias of in situ measurements and thus improve the knowledge about environmental flows this improvement would benefit turbine manufacturers in the optimisation of turbine design this work is based on a unique simulation configuration characterised by its flow velocity size and spacing of roughness and water column height these conditions are representative of flows at typical tidal energy sites where the general conclusions of this work would apply nevertheless it is expected that different types of flow would potentially lead to different conclusions real seabed morphology is diversified as well as environmental flow characteristics the flow obtained in this study from an idealised seabed roughness cannot be assumed to be representative of all environmental flows thus the conclusions of the present work must be put into perspective with the actual seabed and hydrodynamic conditions of any other specific studied site v adcps do not take all biases into account numerical simulations are an idealised environment that do not include physical processes leading to the acquisition of data outliers the conclusions proposed here give insight for quantifying some sources of error but do not exonerate from usual corrections and uncertainties applied in adcp measurements such as the bias in turbulence measurements induced by the doppler noise for future work new simulations could be conducted using different seabed geometries water depth and averaged velocity magnitudes this would help in understanding the effect of these parameters on the accuracy of the tested adcp configuration and provide more insight into the interpretation of real adcp measurements v adcps could be implemented with more detailed numerical models to take into account physical phenomena that are neglected in this study such as spatial averaging over an adcp cell this would improve the fidelity of v adcp data acquisition with respect to real adcps and reinforce the relevance of the conclusions and prescriptions obtained from v adcp analysis also the v adcp method could be used not only for turbulence measurements but also for average velocity measurements in particular it could be used to assess the potential improvement brought by adcps based on higher acquisition frequencies finally the simulation of realistic environmental flows combined with the v adcp method could help testing new adcp beam configurations the sensitivity of the measurements to the number of beams beam orientations cell thickness or acquisition frequency could be assessed to optimise these parameters for measurements performed in specific environments credit authorship contribution statement philippe mercier conceptualization methodology software investigation writing

20921,the deployment of tidal turbines requires a precise hydrodynamic characterisation of the production site acoustic doppler current profilers adcp usually employed for measuring the time mean characteristics of environmental flows could also be used for assessing the main features of turbulence adcp measurements are sensitive to many sources of uncertainties associated mainly with the spreading of the beams or the assumptions made on flow homogeneity the ability of adcps to accurately measure the hydrodynamic parameters of a given flow can be tested on a synthetic dataset however it is difficult to generate a dataset representative of a real environmental flow in this work large eddy simulation of a high reynolds flow over a rough seabed is performed and used to assess the accuracy of two coupled 4 beam adcp systems forming an 8 beam arrangement the study confirms the relevance and efficiency of the tested 8 beam configuration for the characterisation of turbulence the results near the seabed are of a lower quality with up to 50 error on the reynolds stresses for elevations under twice the roughness height which questions the interpretation of adcp measurements in the lower part of the water column also the spatial averaging over adcp cells leads to an underestimation of the turbulence intensity of 10 to 20 keywords turbulence lattice boltzmann method large

of the turbulent energy and control most of the momentum transfer and turbulent mixing for these reasons lbm les has been used for environmental numerical simulations parmigiani 2013 mercier et al 2020a here lbm les is chosen to perform a simulation of a channel flow over a uniform distribution of wall mounted cubes designed to be representative of a tidal energy site the v adcp method is performed on the simulation output to test the accuracy of the adcp configuration proposed by vermeulen et al 2011 firstly the numerical simulation method is presented as well as the adcp configuration and principles of the v adcp method then the simulation results are exploited to investigate the sources of error finally the prospects and limits of the method are discussed 2 methods 2 1 numerical flow simulation simulations are performed with the lbm bhatnagar et al 1954 qian et al 1992 a full description of which can be found in guo and shu 2013 the code is based on palabos a c library latt et al 2020 les relies on the static smagorinsky model smagorinsky 1963 with a smagorinsky constant of 0 14 the discretisation scheme is d3q19 and the collision operator relies on the work of latt and chopard 2006 a no slip boundary condition is used at the seabed based on the work of bouzidi et al 2001 periodic boundary conditions are applied at the longitudinal and lateral boundaries a free slip boundary condition is applied at the water surface position the simulation domain is 320 m long 80 m wide and 40 m deep the seabed is composed of 3 m large cubic elements disposed regularly over the bottom see fig 1 this macro roughness aims at generating a vertical variation of the turbulence intensity similar to that measured with two coupled 4 beam adcps in the raz blanchard thiébaut et al 2020b where the mean vertical profile of longitudinal turbulence intensity ranged from 12 near the surface to 21 near the adcps at the seabed as the domain is periodic the load losses tend to decrease the flow velocity this effect is offset by a longitudinal volume force that sustains the flow the time step is 0 010 s the mesh resolution is 0 21 m near the seabed and 0 42 m near the water surface the domain contains 28 3 million cells the average longitudinal speed is 3 m s 1 for a volume force corresponding to a 2 5 10 3 m s 2 acceleration the instantaneous longitudinal velocity along a vertical longitudinal plane is shown in fig 2 the simulation ran on 56 processors for 78 h the total simulated time is 52 min with a convergence period of 36 min for in situ measurements the period of data extraction must be long enough to guarantee a sufficient number of samples and short enough not to be affected by changes in the hydrodynamic conditions relative to the tidal cycle this condition is satisfied by using a 10 min period in the case studied in the work of thiébaut et al 2020b here as there is no variation in the hydrodynamic conditions the period is extended to 16 min longitudinal lateral and vertical velocity components are respectively referred to as u v and w acting in the x y and z directions herein time averaged u and time fluctuating u velocities are defined in such way that u u u 2 2 virtual adcps in the present work the two coupled 4 beam adcp configuration designed by vermeulen et al 2011 is tested this configuration is specially conceived for turbulence measurements its working principle is described hereinafter the v adcps are modelled to represent the sampling geometry of the coupled adcps in the representative velocity field derived from the numerical flow simulation two upward looking 4 beam v adcps coupled in a master slave set up are positioned on the seabed forming an 8 beam arrangement where the beams are numbered from 1 to 8 fig 3 the two v adcps are at a distance of 0 5 m from each other the v adcps record alternatively the velocities in beam coordinates radial velocities at the frequency rate of 2 hz the angle θ between the transducers and the vertical is 20 in accordance with the 4 beam adcps used in vermeulen et al 2011 and thiébaut et al 2020c b a cartesian coordinate system o x y z is defined relative to the master v adcp with the origin o located at the centre of the four transducers fig 3 the orientation of the master v adcp is such that the opposite beams 1 and 2 are oriented along the direction of the longitudinal velocity u defining the x axis whereas beams 3 and 4 are oriented along the direction of the lateral velocity v defining the y axis the slave v adcp is rotated to an angle ϕ 1 20 around the x axis fig 3 and ϕ 3 45 around the z axis resulting in a tilted v adcp with one beam pointed vertically upward fig 4 no rotation is applied around the y axis ϕ 2 0 the coupled adcp method developed by vermeulen et al 2011 combines i the traditional transformation method where two opposite beams of the adcp are used to transform velocities in beam coordinates to velocities in cartesian coordinates with ii the rotation of the slave relative to the master adcp the velocities in beam coordinates equates to the velocities u v w in cartesian coordinates as in eq 1 1 b t u where b is an eight component vector containing all the radial velocity components from the two coupled adcps u is the velocity vector in the cartesian coordinate system u u e x v e y w e z and t is the transformation matrix involving sines and cosines of θ ϕ 1 ϕ 2 and ϕ 3 vermeulen et al 2011 thiébaut et al 2020c b the velocities in the cartesian coordinate system are obtained by inverting the transformation matrix t in order to obtain the components of the reynolds stress tensor from the velocity variances in beam coordinates a new eight by six matrix q is computed resulting from the product of the terms in t vermeulen et al 2011 thiébaut et al 2020c b the vector v b containing the velocity variances in beam coordinates is written as the product of q by the vector r containing the six terms of the reynolds stress tensor as in eq 2 2 v b q r the six element vector r can be rearranged to form the reynolds stress tensor according to eq 3 3 r r 1 r 4 r 5 r 4 r 2 r 6 r 5 r 6 r 3 u 2 u v u w u v v 2 v w u w v w w 2 the reynolds stresses indicate the orientation of the eddies in the flow and are often used to estimate fundamental turbulence metrics such as the turbulence intensity the tke dissipation rate or the tke production rate here the u u v v and w w components will be referred to as normal stresses and the u v u w and v w components as the shear stresses v adcp cells are defined by all the mesh nodes included in a volume delimited by a frustum of 4 beam cone the cells of the master and slave v adcp are respectively 1 28 m and 1 37 m thick this corresponds to the configuration used in thiébaut et al 2020c the cells are presented in fig 4 they are composed of a number of mesh nodes ranging from 4 to 135 and their volume ranges from 0 5 m3 to 17 m 3 depending on their elevation similarly to real adcps the spatial averaging of the radial velocity is performed on each cell volume this process is replicated on each v adcp beam the issue of doppler noise brumley et al 1991 and other practical operational considerations are ignored also if the acquisition frequency affects the consideration of the smallest scales of the turbulence in standard adcp uses guion and young 2014 it is not the case for data processing based on the variance method thus this matter is not addressed here the reynolds stresses are computed directly from the synthetic flow field on a vertical profile centred on the master v adcp position with a high frequency data acquisition 100 hz this dataset will be referred to as the reference dataset simultaneously the reynolds stresses are calculated from the velocities recorded by the v adcp the comparison between reynolds stresses derived from both methods will allow for the assessment of the error inherent to adcp measurements 3 results 3 1 comparison of reynolds stresses derived from the reference dataset and v adcp fig 5 shows scatterplots of the six components of the reynolds stress tensor derived from the reference dataset and the v adcp at each cell elevation the 1 1 black line indicates perfect agreement between reynolds stresses derived from both methods in general a good agreement is found with the u u v v w w u v and u w components matching the 1 1 line however a few values are found to be significantly far from the 1 1 line especially in the normal stresses u u and v v where these values were calculated near the seabed moreover the component v v exhibits some inconsistencies with two negative values derived from the v adcp the scatterplots of the normal stresses u u v v and w w are slightly right skewed indicating that the v adcp underestimates these components since the normal stresses allow for the calculation of the turbulence intensity it is expected that the v adcp gives underestimated values of this metric moreover the shear stress v w is characterised by very low absolute values this is imputed to the symmetric characteristic of the domain the domain symmetry should imply that the u v component also satisfies this condition which is not the case vertical profiles of the reynolds stresses are shown in fig 6 this figure exhibits a good agreement between profiles derived from the reference dataset and v adcp the absolute error is greater near the seabed which could result from spatial heterogeneity of the flow over a horizontal plane that invalidates the homogeneity assumption this assumption is necessary for the application of the method proposed by vermeulen et al 2011 section 2 2 however as demonstrated by nikuradse 1950 and perry et al 1969 this assumption is true for elevations above 2 to 5 times the roughness height therefore it may not be valid in the lower part of the water column which induces high error this is consistent with the high absolute error observed here up to 8 m above the seabed the maximum relative error maxerror eq 4 and the root mean square error rmse eq 5 between the reynolds stresses derived from the reference dataset and the v adcp are shown in table 1 only values calculated at a height above seabed higher than 8 m are taken into account the maximum rmse is associated with the shear stress v w with a value of 137 this high value is not troublesome as the v w component is centred on zero the rmse of the five other components of the reynolds stress tensor is relatively low with values ranging from 8 to 14 and up to 33 for u v the maximum relative error varies over a wide range with the three components u u v v and w w associated with maximum relative error lower than 27 whereas the u v and u w components exhibit maximum values of 91 and 34 respectively the component v w reveals considerable maximum error reaching 353 which is once again explained by the fact that the v w component is centred on zero 4 maxerror x 100 max x r e f x v a d c p max x r e f 5 rmse x 100 ω x r e f x v a d c p 2 l d ω max x r e f 3 2 assessment of turbulence homogeneity over the beams the operating principle of the coupled 4 beam adcp system requires the inherent assumption of homogeneity in the flow within the sampled area the reference dataset computed from the synthetic flow field allows for the direct determination of the vertical evolution of the reynolds stresses along each beam of the v adcps fig 7 it is thus possible to perform a turbulence homogeneity test over the beams fig 7 shows that for a given component of the reynolds stress tensor the profiles derived from each v adcp beam have the same behaviour their magnitude increases abruptly up to an elevation of 8 10 m and decreases above 10 m up to the maximum elevation the only component that confirms the turbulence homogeneity assumption throughout the water column is the normal stress w w for the components v v and u w the assumption is not valid for elevations higher than 15 m and 20 m respectively the normal stress u u reveals two ranges in elevation where the homogeneity assumption may be validated i from 0 to 8 m and ii from 20 to 38 m the maximum elevation between both layers the reynolds stress profiles can be split into three groups of beams the first group is composed of beams 1 2 5 and 7 where these beams are aligned with the flow direction in this direction the turbulence is homogeneous and rapidly advected the second group is composed of beams 4 6 and 8 whose associated profiles exhibit similar behaviour these beams share the same three dimensional spanning area fig 4 thus as expected these beams capture comparable turbulence processes beam 3 spans a different area and constitutes the last group this decomposition in three groups is particularly noticeable for the component u v throughout the water column fig 8a shows the vertical profiles of the reynolds stresses derived from the reference dataset and averaged over the 8 beams the profiles used to calculate and normalise the average gap between individual and spatially averaged beams are represented in fig 8b for u u v v w w and u w components the discrepancies are high in the lower part of the water column up to 10 m low in the medium part of the water column and increase between 20 m and the maximum elevation for u v and v w the same tendency is observed but with higher magnitudes the origin of the discrepancies in the lower part of the water column can be explained by the presence of seabed roughness that is expected to affect the homogeneity of the flow up to 2 to 5 times its height 6 m to 15 m discrepancies observed in the upper part of the water column could be explained by increasing distance between v adcp beams potentially reducing the validity of the assumption made on the horizontal homogeneity of the flow 3 3 effect of spatial averaging inside v adcp cells similarly to real adcps the velocities derived from the v adcps were averaged over each bin cell volume this spatial averaging is expected to filter small eddies thus affecting the evaluation of turbulence metrics this filtering effect can be assessed through numerical simulation because the full velocity vector is accessible at a high spatial resolution in order to investigate the potential filtering induced biases when characterising turbulence the reference dataset extracted from individual simulation nodes are compared to the data averaged over each cell of the 7th beam of the v adcps fig 9 this beam is oriented vertically upward and matches the position of the vertical reference profile the vertical evolution of the reynolds stresses derived from both the reference dataset and the v adcps are similar however the v adcp data significantly and systematically underestimates the magnitude of the reynolds stresses especially for the normal stresses this result is in agreement with the right skewed distribution of the scatterplots associated with the normal stresses presented in fig 5 for each component the difference is more significant in the lower part of the water column and ranges from 10 to 20 4 conclusion in this study the ability of a coupled 4 beam adcp system to characterise the six components of the reynolds stress tensor is assessed les of high reynolds flow over a rough bed is performed in order to build a reference synthetic dataset used to directly estimate the reynolds stresses the coupled adcp system v adcp is assumed to be located on the seabed measuring the along beam velocities of the synthetic flow vermeulen et al 2011 the reynolds stresses derived from the v adcps are estimated following the methodology proposed by thiébaut et al 2020c b comparison between reynolds stresses derived from both the reference dataset and the v adcps are generally in good agreement the flow heterogeneity over the adcp beams and the spatial averaging over adcp cells are found to be the two main sources of error in the interpretation of adcp measurements flow heterogeneity is observed in the lower part of the water column where the seabed roughness wakes have a local influence on the turbulence metrics it is significant up to twice the roughness height 6 m this leads to high discrepancies between v adcp and reference results as a consequence adcp measurements should be interpreted with caution near the seabed in the case of a high seabed roughness flow heterogeneity is also observed in the upper part of the water column where the distance between beams increases the heterogeneity is observed in the lateral direction and not in the longitudinal direction indeed the transport of turbulence characteristics in the longitudinal direction is expected to be faster than its diffusion in the lateral direction resulting in a higher homogeneity in the longitudinal direction than in the lateral direction however this heterogeneity is expected to have a minor effect on the accuracy of the measurements since reynolds stresses derived from the reference dataset and the v adcps are found to be consistent the spatial averaging over the cells in the numerical model is found to underestimate the reynolds stresses by 10 to 20 in particular the normal components which are used to estimate the turbulence intensity the spatial averaging is performed to simulate the working principle of a real adcp however for this type of sensor the averaging is not uniform over the cells instead the cells are most sensitive to velocities at their centre and least sensitive at the edges the velocity in each depth cell is a weighted average using a triangular weighting function this is not considered in the present study these insights could help reducing uncertainties and systematic bias of in situ measurements and thus improve the knowledge about environmental flows this improvement would benefit turbine manufacturers in the optimisation of turbine design this work is based on a unique simulation configuration characterised by its flow velocity size and spacing of roughness and water column height these conditions are representative of flows at typical tidal energy sites where the general conclusions of this work would apply nevertheless it is expected that different types of flow would potentially lead to different conclusions real seabed morphology is diversified as well as environmental flow characteristics the flow obtained in this study from an idealised seabed roughness cannot be assumed to be representative of all environmental flows thus the conclusions of the present work must be put into perspective with the actual seabed and hydrodynamic conditions of any other specific studied site v adcps do not take all biases into account numerical simulations are an idealised environment that do not include physical processes leading to the acquisition of data outliers the conclusions proposed here give insight for quantifying some sources of error but do not exonerate from usual corrections and uncertainties applied in adcp measurements such as the bias in turbulence measurements induced by the doppler noise for future work new simulations could be conducted using different seabed geometries water depth and averaged velocity magnitudes this would help in understanding the effect of these parameters on the accuracy of the tested adcp configuration and provide more insight into the interpretation of real adcp measurements v adcps could be implemented with more detailed numerical models to take into account physical phenomena that are neglected in this study such as spatial averaging over an adcp cell this would improve the fidelity of v adcp data acquisition with respect to real adcps and reinforce the relevance of the conclusions and prescriptions obtained from v adcp analysis also the v adcp method could be used not only for turbulence measurements but also for average velocity measurements in particular it could be used to assess the potential improvement brought by adcps based on higher acquisition frequencies finally the simulation of realistic environmental flows combined with the v adcp method could help testing new adcp beam configurations the sensitivity of the measurements to the number of beams beam orientations cell thickness or acquisition frequency could be assessed to optimise these parameters for measurements performed in specific environments credit authorship contribution statement philippe mercier conceptualization methodology software investigation writing

20922,this article investigates bearing behaviors of a batter piled wharf subjected to cyclic episodes of lateral loading with varying amplitude through two way displacement controlled centrifuge modeling results show that the lateral load vibrated around residual values and deviated toward waterside lateral stiffness exhibited degradation with increasing cycles in each constant magnitude sequence the residual vertical displacement kept decreasing and tended to become constant over time the residual pore pressure was positive in the seabed soil and around piles over time the soil around double plumb piles registered larger residual pore pressure and magnitudes than other areas the increase or decrease of soil pressure depends on the balance of pore pressure redistribution and soil reconsolidation in the upper soil and the lower soil registered decreasing soil pressures owing to poor drainage condition induced soil softening plumb piles exhibited waterside curvature in the upper part and the bending moment around the front double plumb pile head was larger than other plumb piles the whole forward batter pile exhibited waterside curvature induced by the soil settlement while the backward batter pile bore the largest bending moment around the pile head and its landside curvature tended to relieve affected by the soil settlement keywords centrifuge modeling batter piled wharf lateral cyclic loading bearing behavior 1 introduction pile supported wharfs are widely used in coastal areas for ship berthing and providing handling sites for portal cranes chiou et al 2011 in soft clay conditions in particular code of china 2010 xie et al 2015 the wharfs front and rear are equipped with double plumb and batter piles see fig 1 to improve the lateral load capacity considering that the single plumb pile s lateral load bearing capacity is limited xie et al 2017 however cyclic lateral loads induced by ship mooring and breasting is still a major concern fan and yuan 2014 yan et al 2020c zhang et al 2015 which will transmit from the superstructure to piles and then to the foundation the stiffness of the lateral response is affected by the cyclic loading zhang et al 2011 zhang and ng 2017 which further affects the cyclic strains and therefore induces fatigue damage that accumulates within both the pile itself and the superstructures andres and paul 2015 as shown in fig 2 the ultimate lateral bearing capacity of the pile supported wharf after cyclic loading must be estimated to ensure that the foundation has sufficient strength in an extreme loading event code of china 2010 zhang et al 2011 previous researchers investigated the lateral static performance of the pile supported wharf using analytical or numerical methods fayyazi et al 2014 investigated the group reduction factors for analysis of laterally loaded pile groups effects of pile spacing pile head condition and soil s friction angle andres and paul 2015 analyzed the elastic stability of idealized plumb pile supported structures which took the coupling between the pile s flexural stiffness lateral stiffness of the surrounding soil and factored gravity loads into consideration wang and he 2017 investigated the lateral static characteristics of a plumb pile supported wharf using finite element methods and proposed simplified methods of calculating the structural displacement they all neglected the effect of the batter piles which induced the torsion of the pile supported wharf under lateral loads and might lead to a large difference in structural bearing behaviors xie et al 2017 built finite element models of a pile supported wharf in the finite element software ansys to investigate the lateral loading behavior and parametric analyzes on the working behavior of batter piled wharf with varying slopes section sizes and load levels being performed compared with the theoretical analysis and the finite element method large scale or prototype tests of pile supported wharfs remain scarce owing to the large equipment costs and technological challenges therefore only a few small scale and centrifuge tests were conducted kawamata 2009 investigated the pile soil interaction of full scale single or capped piles in rockfill by performing a series of lateral load tests to obtain the relationship between the lateral load and the displacement taghavi et al 2015 conducted a series of centrifuge tests to investigate laterally loaded capped pile groups behavior in improved and unimproved soft clay test results revealed that cement deep soil mixing is an effective method to increase the lateral resistance of pile foundations by comparing the lateral resistance however in structural configuration the pile supported wharf is more complicated than single or capped piles yan et al 2020c performed centrifuge tests to investigate the bent displacement the bending moment of a defective pile supported wharf a static lateral load was applied on the pile supported wharf and numerical models were employed to back analyze the centrifuge test which provided design aids for the reinforcement project previous literature reviews also investigated the pile supported wharf s seismic performance in addition to these static lateral assessments chiou et al 2011 and yang et al 2012 developed fragility curves for a pile supported wharf using the capacity spectrum or finite element methods shafieezadeh et al 2012a b conducted 2d and 3d nonlinear seismic analyses of a typical pile supported wharf the results showed that a 2d wharf representation might not fully account for dynamic 3d response characteristics su et al 2017 revealed the pile ground and pile to pile interaction mechanisms salient characteristics by employing a full 3d finite element simulation framework takahashi and takemura 2015 carried out centrifuge model tests to investigate the seismic failure mechanism of a pile supported wharf in front of backfilled gravity type caissons and the effects of liquefaction in the backfill and underlying sand layer on the permanent deformation of the wharf were emphasized and the interaction between piled deck and caisson during the earthquake was measured mccullough et al 2007 employed five pile supported wharf models to measure their seismic performances subjected to recorded acceleration time histories the prototype wharf configurations were very common in the united states although the above large amount of works have been done on the static lateral souri et al 2015 and seismic performances su et al 2014 of a pile supported wharf few types of research have focused on the cyclic lateral behaviors of a batter piled wharf confronting with ship mooring and breasting considering they are the greatest in magnitude and most frequent in particular in the open sea zhang et al 2015 have found that the vibration period of a plumb piled wharf under cyclic loading is longer than that of a batter piled wharf and is much closer to the period of the loading wave through the numerical method and then examined the cyclic response of a plumb piled wharf which found that cyclic amplification of the structure is evident and established a simplified numerical method for calculating the structural displacement response regardless of the huge difference between plumb piled and batter piled wharfs this is far from adequate to evaluate the cyclic structure soil interaction because the remolding and softening of the surrounding soil will degrade the pile soil stiffness as indicated by the cyclic lateral response of a pile in soft clay zhang et al 2011 zhang and ng 2017 and batter piles will alter the stress path and displacement mode of the pile supported wharf yan et al 2020c therefore this article investigated a batter piled wharf s bearing behaviors under lateral cyclic loading through centrifuge modeling a 1 50 scale model was employed e g the centrifuge model was run at 50 g g is the gravity acceleration and the prototype was a five row batter piled wharf that was the front part of a pile supported wharf configuration a series of two way displacement controlled cycles were applied and a large displacement was pulled out of the batter piled wharf to obtain the ultimate lateral capacity the bent displacement pore and soil pressures and bending moment in this loading process were monitored 2 test program 2 1 soil sample preparation an overview of the test package is shown in fig 3 the centrifuge model test was conducted at 50 g in tk c500 in tianjin china details of the centrifuge have been described by yan et al 2020c earlier a schematic diagram of the centrifuge model setup is depicted in fig 4 the strong container used in the test has an internal dimension of 1200 mm in length 1000 mm in width and 1200 mm in depth the strong container was first filled with water and then sand was rained into it at a constant flow rate from a rainer to form a uniform underlying sand layer and the sand density was increased by increasing the height of the fall kaolin clay slurry with a water content of 120 was then added to cover the sand layer the rigid container was then slowly filled with de aired water from the bottom and exceeded 10 cm over the soil surface the soil parameters are listed in table 1 consolidation was performed in a consolidometer and loading weights were applied in a step incremental manner under 1 g condition after approximately 20 days the settlement stopped to increase and the container was moved on the centrifuge at an acceleration of 100 g to obtain overconsolidated clay whose strength increased with depth after the preloading process part of the upper kaolin clay was excavated to form the slope and the seabed gradually with great care reduced soil disturbance and avoided excessive excavations the excavation was manually conducted because the robot excavator and heavy liquid method ong et al 2006 were difficult to implement particularly for bent installation the soil was reconsolidated with an acceleration of 100 g to create the overconsolidated clay sample with a slope of 1 3 the lengths of the model seabed and berm were 610 mm and 110 mm respectively the thickness of the fengpu sand was 200 mm and the thickness of the kaolin clay ranged from 340 mm to 500 mm indicating that the fall from berm to the seabed was 160 mm the vane shear strength was monitored before and after the formal test as shown in fig 5 for the seabed and interface soil the vane shear strengths exhibited a generally uniform distribution in the upper soil but linearly increased with soil depth in the lower soil before the test however the vane shear strength increased in the seabed soil probably owing to the reconsolidation and decreased in the upper interface soil due to soil degradation after the test for the berm soil the vane shear strength decreased in the upper part and increased in the lower part with soil depth before the test which was attributed to the stress relief induced by excavation and the effect of consolidation but decreased in the middle soil and increased in the lower soil after the test the soil strength comparison before and after the test indicated that soil strength might continue to increase and the cyclic loading on the batter piled wharf affected the soil status 2 2 model bent the bent model follows a prototype in tianjin port which possessed a slab girders one row of double plumb piles in the waterside one row of middle single piles and two rows of forward and backward batter piles in the landside as shown in fig 3 b because minor errors in model dimensions may result in great differences the equivalence principle of bending stiffness and the model preparation technique were both considered in the model preparation yan et al 2020a and thus the bent model may not exactly correspond to the prototype fig 4 depicts the dimensions of the bent components the model slab dimensions were 250 mm in length 440 4 mm in width and 7 5 mm in height both lengthwise girders and widthwise girders were used and their lengths were 105 mm and 140 mm respectively the plumb and batter piles were different in dimensions the plumb piles section size was 11 mm 11 mm with a hollow wall thickness of 0 65 mm while the batter piles were 10 mm 10 mm with a hollow wall thickness of 0 60 mm in comparison the dimensions of the prototype plumb piles were 0 55 m 0 55 m with hollows of 0 30 m 0 30 m while the dimensions of the prototype batter piles were 0 50 m 0 50 m with hollows of 0 27 m 0 27 m the oblique angle of the batter piles was 25 24 and the torsional angle was 45 after the preparation of the model the bent model was installed at the designated location of the container the pile tips were 309 2 mm distance to the container bottom and the batter pile tips were 141 2 mm distance to the container wall thus the boundary conditions have little effects on the structure soil interaction yan et al 2019 2 3 transducer layout fig 6 depicts the layout of piles and transducer ids in the test two displacement laser sensors lss were employed to measure the lateral and vertical displacement in the front of the bent and another one was used to monitor the vertical displacement in the middle thus the tilting condition could be derived with these displacements to better present the transducers layout the front and rear double plumb piles were numbered as p1 and p2 the middle plumb pile was numbered as p3 and the forward and backward batter piles were numbered as p4 and p5 respectively five pore pressure transducers ppts were embedded in the seabed soil in the soil around p1 and p3 and in the soil between p4 and p5 and the ppts doted as ppt1 ppt5 six soil pressure transducers spts were evenly distributed every 4 cm around the p1 and the p3 respectively and were noted as spt1 spt12 thus the soil pressure distributions could be derived five strain gauges were evenly distributed on the plumb and batter piles and these sgs on every pile were consecutively numbered from head to bottom for example no 1 2 represented the second sg on p 1 no 2 3 represented the third sg on p 2 and so forth the sgs on the piles were wiped with epoxy resin to protect the sgs from destruction during the test 2 4 test setup a hydraulic loading device was installed on the container after the container was moved to the centrifuge table payload mounting area a servo valve controlled cylinder drove the loading device and the velocity ranged from 0 006 20 mm s the loading point was selected at the front of the slab and connected to the loading device with high strength connections water was added approximately 12 cm above the seabed surface to guarantee enough berthing draft corresponding to 6 m in the prototype the centrifuge spuds up from 1 g to 50 g after loading device installation and water addition and this process lasted 4 h the variation in the slope was very slight during the centrifuge acceleration from 1 g to 50 g two way displacement controlled cycles were imposed and then a large displacement was applied to obtain the ultimate lateral capacity after the cyclic displacement phase the loading device s velocity was 0 5 mm s in the test that is sufficient to ensure undrained conditions the cyclic loading process involved consecutive packets of 20 cycles for each sequence from seq1 to seq4 with increasing amplitude from y d 0 25 to y d 1 0 y represents the amplitude of the applied lateral displacement d represents the pile diameter of the battered pile to identify the influence of previous cyclic movements corresponding to 0 125 m 0 25 m 0 375 m and 0 50 m in the prototype the final load step was terminated after the lateral displacement reached 1 25 m under the large monotonic displacement a large enough displacement from the functional point of view yan et al 2020a in the following section test results are depicted in the prototype scale following the centrifuge principles taylor 1995 3 test results 3 1 load and displacement behaviors the time histories of lateral displacements are presented in fig 7 which showed that the applied lateral displacement corresponded well with the designated revealing that the hydraulic loading device has reliable performance full two way horizontal displacement cycles were performed with amplitudes from y d 0 25 to y d 1 0 and the corresponding loading time were 11 57 days for seq1 23 15 days for seq2 34 72 days for seq3 46 30 days for seq4 and 1 45 days for monotonic loading 117 19 days in total the actual loading time was slightly longer than designated because the loading arm flexure adjustment was considered in the test the time histories of applied lateral loads are shown in fig 8 the lateral loads vibrated around the residual value mean value of the maximum and minimum lateral loads and deviated toward waterside due to batter piles layout the batter piled wharf tilted toward the waterside under lateral pulling loads yan et al 2020c and the remolding was easier toward the waterside due to the slope the residual lateral loads fell quickly to negative values in seq1 and the falling tendency became gentle in seq2 to seq4 indicating that the soil strength decreases sharply when the pile first begins to remold that zone of the soil a relatively progressive degradation occurs in the later cycles until the soil strength stabilizes after many cycles wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 fig 9 shows details of the maximum residual and minimum lateral load tendencies versus cycles in these sequences the maximum and minimum lateral loads generally decreased in every sequence but increased in magnitude from seq1 to seq4 owing to the magnitude variations in lateral displacement although the residual lateral loads in the first few cycles were greater than that in the last few cycles of the former sequence hamilton and murff 1995 generally reducing residual lateral loads were observed with increasing cycles fig 10 shows the lateral load deflection curve and the development of secant lateral stiffness versus cycle numbers the stiffness shows degradation with increasing cycles in every sequence that possessed a constant magnitude this phenomenon can be linked to the strain softening soil behavior and the zone of soil that is influenced as the pile moves laterally the reduction in soil strength and stiffness from remolding during any previous loading history softens the pile soil response when the pile is pushed toward the failure condition zhou and randolph 2009 and this effect is countered by any recovery from reconsolidation an alternative mechanism that can also reduce the stiffness during cyclic loading is the opening of a gap around piles murff and hamilton 1993 zhang et al 2011 there was a generally reducing stiffness from seq1 to seq4 as the amplitude of horizontal displacement increased but the first stiffness is significantly higher than the cyclic stiffness observed on the former cyclic episode the extent of the pile resistant soil zone increased from seq1 to seq4 resulting in new soil being involved in the failure mechanism and soil being softened as cycles occurred wang et al 2018 2019 zhang and ng 2017 the degradation rate became smaller from seq1 to seq4 as observed in the hysteresis curve and the corresponding lateral stiffness curve indicating that many cycles of movement the cumulative increase in total strain and the consequent remolding of the local soil led to a reduction in the lateral resistance both of these effects are shown systematically by the selected displacement deflection curve more clearly and thus the effect of cycle numbers was elaborated as shown in fig 11 the vertical displacement histories and corresponding lateral load vertical displacement cycles in the front and middle of the slab are shown in fig 12 influenced by the increasing lateral displacement magnitude in different sequences the vertical displacement increased in magnitude the residual vertical displacement decreased and tended to become constant over time indicating that the bent sank into the soil due to soil softening and remolding yan et al 2018a the residual vertical displacement in the middle of the slab was greater than that in the slab s front which was attributed to the hydraulic loading device s constriction thus the overturning of the wharf was toward the landside which was some difference with practical conditions the lateral load vertical displacement curve tended to be dense with increasing vertical displacement in every sequence indicating that the vertical displacement increased strikingly at the beginning of every sequence the residual vertical displacement decreased to negative values when the residual lateral load deviated toward waterside and the lateral load vertical displacement curve also tended to be dense from seq1 to seq4 the phenomenon can be linked to a gain in the soil s strength immediately local to the pile following each episode of cyclic disturbance leading to pore pressure generation and reconsolidation leading to pore pressure dissipation and increasing soil density zhang et al 2011 the spatial extent of remolding is affected by the amplitude of preceding cycles and the extent of this remolding depends on the number of previous cycles displacement tendencies under monotonic lateral load after cyclic loading are depicted in fig 13 the lateral load exhibited a quick increase whereas the displacement slowly increased at the beginning the displacement of the bent increased quickly toward the waterside and the curve exhibited strong nonlinearity i e the lateral displacement became increasingly large with loading time indicating increasing soil plastic deformation and pile deformation wang et al 2018 the ultimate lateral capacity after cyclic loading can be determined using load displacement curves and the criterion that the load corresponding to the intersection of the two tangents of the elastic stage and failure stage was employed from the functional point of view yan et al 2020a the ultimate lateral load capacity after cyclic loading was 4 mn by comparison the vertical displacement increased indicating that the batter piled wharf was raised under monotonic lateral pulling the increment in the middle of the slab was greater than that in the front indicating the wharf tended to overturn toward the waterside under monotonic lateral pulling fig 14 presents the batter piled wharf s ultimate post cyclic failure mode after cyclic and monotonic pulling load in the centrifuge test the bent overturned toward the landside as indicated by the obliquely oriented slab and piles which was different from the failure mode under a pure pulling load yan et al 2020c the soil around the piles moved toward the waterside due to pile pushing and the pile soil interfaces on the landside separated in the test which reduced the lateral stiffness moreover many fissures see fig 14 b have been observed to develop on the slope in the rear of the backward batter pile which prevented them from transmitting their full pressures onto the pile ong et al 2003 2009 on the other hand this phenomenon has revealed that soil movement has occurred around the batter piled wharf by staking under monotonic load 3 2 pore pressure response the pore pressure response reflects the soil s effective stress conditions and provides key information on the influence of cycles on the soil status and progressive soil shearing ong et al 2006 ppt1 registered positive pore pressures in the seabed soil from seq1 to seq4 as shown in fig 15 a the residual pore pressure and the corresponding magnitude were small over time this is attributed to the location of ppt1 which is relatively far from the piles ong et al 2003 the cyclic loading was transferred from piles and surrounding soil the induced cyclic stress had abated at this location yan et al 2018a the maximum pore pressure was very close to the minimum pore pressure and the residual pore pressure showed an increasing constant tendency with residual lateral load indicating a positive correlation between the pore pressure and residual lateral load although the lateral displacement magnitude increased from seq1 to seq4 it is found that the residual pore pressure only slightly increased with lateral displacement and cycles whereas the magnitude varied little unlike ppt1 ppt2 registered both positive and negative pore pressures around p1 through the cyclic loading process in fig 15 b the residual pore pressure and corresponding magnitude increased evidently over time and maximum values in seq4 were approximately 30 kpa which was evidently greater than those in seabed soil the maximum and residual pore pressures increased whereas the minimum pore pressures first increased then decreased with the increasing residual lateral load this is because the soil around p1 was most affected by the lateral load due to the closest distance to the loading point yan et al 2018a b the soil generated positive pore pressure due to the cyclic progressive undrained shearing and remolding of clay although seepage occurred and pore pressure redistributed over time the negative pore pressure was too small to cancel out the positive pore pressure ong et al 2003 2009 the enclosed hysteresis curve areas evidently increased with increasing cycles and lateral displacement and their backbones curves through peak points of the selected cycles moved upward to large values which elaborated the increasing residual pore pressure and magnitude tendencies ppt3 registered positive pore pressures whose residual values increased over time and pore pressures seemed to have large magnitudes in seq2 and seq3 in fig 15 c the pore pressure first increased slowly with a residual lateral load but then increased at a larger rate the maximum pore pressure was approximately 12 kpa which was smaller than ppt2 but larger than ppt1 indicating the soil shearing and remolding around p3 was slighter than around p1 due to its spatial effect and the loading point yan et al 2018a b the backbones of enclosed hysteresis curves moved upward to large values with increasing cycles and the pore pressure magnitudes slightly varied with lateral displacement ppt4 and ppt5 registered pore pressures in the soil between p4 and p5 and the results are presented in fig 15 d e the pore pressure registered by ppt4 was smaller than that registered by ppt5 indicating that the upper soil was more affected by the cyclic stress induced by the spatial effect of batter piles yan et al 2018a however because of a relatively far distance of ppt4 and ppt5 to the loading point pore pressure values were smaller than those registered by ppt2 and ppt3 the pore pressure magnitude increased from seq1 to seq4 whereas the residual pore pressure only slightly increased at the beginning of the cyclic loading but remained almost constant over time correspondingly the maximum and minimum pore pressures increased and decreased respectively the backbones of enclosed hysteresis curves seemed to coincide with increasing cycles and the pore pressure magnitudes slightly varied with lateral displacement 3 3 soil pressure response the soil pressure response reflected the displacement behaviors of the piles and structure soil interactions lian et al 2014 yan et al 2019 furthermore the soil status can be qualitatively derived by associating the soil pressure with the pore pressure soil pressures around p1 are presented in fig 16 a and the locations of spts are marked on the inset spt1 was located at 13 35 m from the pile head and it registered a constant decreasing increasing soil pressure tendency over time the soil pressure varied little at small residual lateral load but became negative at large lateral load magnitude by comparison spt2 registered positive soil pressures over time which exhibited an increasing decreasing tendency at 15 35 m from the pile head also this is because spt1 and spt2 were located near the slope surface to obtain drainage channels and it is more convenient for the pore pressure to dissipate and the soil to reconsolidate ong et al 2006 yan et al 2018a when the soil pressure increased thus to increase the soil density and strength at these locations zhang et al 2011 however when a large amount of pore pressure continued to generate due to the cyclic loading taken spt2 as an example the soil strength might degrade and soil pressure started to fall therefore the increase or decrease depends on the balance of pore pressure redistribution and soil reconsolidation following this soil pressures of spt7 see fig 16 b exhibited an increasing tendency over time and seemed to possess relatively constant magnitude with increasing lateral load spt8 soil pressures increased first then decreased to negative values over time and residual lateral load notably soil pressures of spt7 and spt8 were located at 11 35 m and 13 35 m from the pile head of p2 the soil pressure of spt3 and spt4 at 17 35 m and 19 35 m from the pile head of p1 first slightly increased and then decreased over time and residual lateral load and the soil pressures obtained large magnitude from seq1 to seq4 indicating the soil pressures were sensitive to lateral displacement magnitude variations by comparison the soil pressures around the bottom of p1 see fig 16 a and middle and bottom of p2 see fig 16 b both showed constant decreasing tendency over time and residual lateral load the inspired soil pressures were small in magnitude this is because the seepage cancelled out the pore pressure generated by cyclic loading at the beginning ong et al 2006 however the soft clay was in poor drainage and the drainage channel was not practical because of the far distance to the slope surface and boundaries yan et al 2018a thus pore pressures were accumulated around piles to induce soil strength degradation liao et al 2019 yan et al 2018b the effective stress was lessened resulting in a decreasing soil pressure because the cyclic stress transferred to the middle and lower soil was relatively small the soil pressure magnitudes were correspondingly small fig 17 shows the selected soil pressure cycles around p1 and p3 the backbones of enclosed hysteresis curves moved downward to large negative pressures with increasing cycles at 17 35 m from the pile head of p1 and the soil pressure magnitudes increased evidently with lateral displacement the hysteretic curve showed the residual soil pressure varied little but the magnitude increased evidently with increasing cycles at 19 35 m from the pile head of p2 indicated by the increasing slopes of the backbones by comparison the backbones of enclosed hysteresis curves slightly moved downward indicating a decreasing soil pressure with increasing cycles and lateral displacement at 15 35 m and 17 35 m from the pile head of p3 it is found that the soil pressure magnitudes varied strikingly around p1 than those around p3 at approximately the same elevations which is attributed to the more intense cyclic stress transferred from the loading point yan et al 2018a the selected soil pressure cycles also revealed that the soil was degraded due to the accumulation of pore pressure 3 4 bending moment response pile bending moment derived from pile strains ko et al 2018 li et al 2016 can reflect a batter piled wharf s structural stress and deformation conditions zhang et al 2011 in the following section the positive bending moment corresponds to waterside curvature and vice versa the bending moment histories of p1 are presented in fig 18 a the bending moment increased rapidly over time in seq1 and this increasing tendency tended to be gentle from seq2 to seq4 at 1 75 m from the pile head whereas the bending moment kept increasing with the residual lateral load the bending moment response was intense because it was more easily affected by the cyclic stress li et al 2016 by comparison the bending moment increased over time and residual lateral load but the increment was small at 5 75 m and 9 75 m from the pile head the residual bending moment below 13 75 m from the pile head generally remained constant or slightly became negative over time and with residual lateral load yan et al 2019 therefore waterside curvature occurred in the upper part of p1 under cyclic loading and the lower part was a little influenced the phenomenon was also found in a pile supported wharf subjected to pulling load and the residual lateral load was considered to be responsible for this phenomenon yan et al 2020c fig 18 b depicts the bending moment histories of p2 the residual bending moment increased in seq1 and seq2 but fell to negative values in seq3 and seq4 at 1 75 m from the pile head this reduction compared to p1 1 was also reflected in the bending moment and residual lateral load relations and was attributed to the shadowing effect of p1 over p2 during cyclic loading the fall of the residual bending moment was probably attributed to some form of rotational degree of freedom relaxation that might have occurred ong et al 2009 the bending moments became slightly positive at 5 75 m and 9 75 m from the pile head and generally remained constant below 13 75 m from the pile head the bending moment magnitudes were larger at 13 75 m and 17 75 m from the pile head of p1 and p2 than that at other locations and seemed to gain stronger responses versus residual lateral load attributed to the intense pile soil interaction ong et al 2015 yan et al 2020c selected bending moment cycles of p1 and p2 are shown in fig 19 the backbones moved up to large bending moment values with cycles and the slope of the backbones varied evidently at 1 75 m from the pile head of p1 by comparison the backbones slightly moved to small bending moment values with cycles and the slopes of backbones were only slightly different at 1 75 m from the pile head of p2 thus demonstrating the shadowing effect of the front pile over the rear pile ong et al 2015 yan et al 2020b the backbone curve of the selected cycles became close to each other with increasing cycles at 13 75 m from pile heads of p1 and p2 and the slope of the backbone showed a decreasing tendency with cycles that is the bending moment magnitudes increased first and subsequently became constant versus the increasing lateral displacement in different sequences however the residual bending moment generally remained constant which corresponded with the abovementioned results fig 20 depicts the bending moment histories and selected bending moment cycles of p3 the maximum bending moment first increased rapidly then tended to be constant over time at 1 75 m from the pile head whereas the minimum bending moment increased in every single sequence but decreased from seq1 to seq4 as a result the residual bending moment was positive and exhibited an increasing decreasing tendency versus residual lateral load the backbones slightly varied from seq1 to seq4 and the magnitude increased with cycles and lateral displacement the residual bending moment was smaller compared to p1 1 because of its relatively far distance from the loading point and the shadowing effect of the front pile over the rear pile the residual bending moments were positive and exhibited an increasing constant tendency over time at 5 75 m and 9 75 m from the pile head whereas they were generally constant over time and with residual lateral load at 13 75 m and 17 75 m from the pile head however their magnitude became larger than those at other elevations and became larger from seq1 to seq4 which was attributed to the pile soil interaction similar to the phenomenon observed in p1 yan et al 2020c zhang et al 2011 the backbone curves were approximately linear with increasing cycles and the bending moment magnitude was sensitive to increasing lateral displacement this indicated that p3 also exhibited a waterside curvature in the upper part but to a lesser extent than p1 fig 21 depicts the bending moment histories of p4 and p5 the residual bending moment increased over time and the corresponding magnitudes also increased from seq1 to seq4 at 2 6 m from the pile head of p4 the bending moment exhibited increasing or increasing decreasing tendency and was positive over time and with residual lateral load at 7 0 m 20 15 m from the pile head of p4 but in smaller values compared to that at 2 6 m from the pile head indicating p4 exhibited a waterside curvature along with the whole pile the reason can be attributed to the soil settlement induced by pore pressure accumulation and soil degradation yan et al 2018a b which pushed the batter pile to exhibit a simple curvature toward waterside however when the settlement tended to be stable the bending moment reduced and this waterside curvature was relieved the bending moment increased evidently over time and the magnitude kept increasing from seq1 to seq4 at 2 60 m from the pile head of p5 the maximum bending moment was approximately 3 5 mn m and the residual bending moment increased rapidly at large residual lateral load the bending moment around batter pile heads was larger than that around plumb piles and the forward batter pile seemed to bear the largest bending moment around the pile head this conclusion corresponded with the phenomenon that the backward batter pile is more easily defected in practical engineering li et al 2018 because of the large bending moment induced eccentric compression at the pile head the different cyclic stress distributions induced by the lateral load and batter piles layout were responsible for the phenomenon the bending moment showed similar increasing tendencies at 7 0 m from the pile head of p5 compared to those around the pile head but in a smaller magnitude the bending moment first decreased then increased over time and residual lateral load at 11 40 m 20 15 m from the pile head of p5 further p5 exhibited waterside curvature at 11 40 m from the pile head but landside curvature at 15 75 m and 20 15 m from the pile head this bending moment distribution revealed that p5 was more affected by the lateral load at the beginning of cyclic loading and the bending moment was positive in the upper part and negative in the lower part yan et al 2020b however the bending moment increased and the landside curvature tended to relieve influenced by the soil settlement because of the pile soil interaction the bending moment magnitudes at 11 40 m and 15 75 m were also larger than those at other elevations giannakou et al 2010 selected bending moment cycles of p4 and p5 are shown in fig 22 the backbones moved up to large values and the magnitude evidently increased with increasing cycles and lateral displacement at 2 60 m from the pile heads of p4 and p5 by comparison the backbones moved up to small values or reduced to negative values with increasing cycles and lateral displacement at 15 57 m from the pile heads of p4 and p5 respectively thus the differences induced by lateral displacement variations were elaborated clearly 4 conclusions this article demonstrated the centrifuge lateral cyclic bearing behaviors of a batter piled wharf in terms of bent displacement pore and soil pressures and bending moment the model s scale was 1 50 and the prototype was a batter piled wharf in tianjin port china two way displacement controlled cycles involved a consecutive packet of 20 cycles for each sequence from seq1 to seq4 with increasing amplitude from y d 0 25 to y d 1 0 y represents the amplitude of the applied lateral displacement d represents the pile diameter of the batter pile was applied a final load step was terminated immediately after the batter piled wharf s lateral displacement exceeded 1 25 m in prototype scale under the large monotonic displacement the main conclusions are as follows 1 the lateral loads vibrated around the residual value the mean value of maximum and minimum lateral loads and deviated toward waterside due to batter piles layout although the maximum and minimum lateral loads generally decreased in every sequence but increased in magnitude from seq1 to seq4 the residual lateral loads generally decreased the cyclic test involving cycles of increasing amplitude showed that the lateral stiffness exhibited degradation with increasing cycles in every sequence that possessed a constant magnitude however the first stiffness is significantly higher than the cyclic stiffness observed on the former cyclic episode while the amplitude of the cyclic movement increased the residual vertical displacement kept decreasing and tended to become constant over time indicating that the bent sank into the soil due to soil softening and remolding which affected the batter piles bending moment distributions the residual vertical displacement in the middle of the slab was greater than the slab s front and in this study the wharf overturned toward the landside the residual vertical displacement decreased to negative values when the residual lateral loads deviated toward waterside and the lateral load vertical displacement curve also tended to be dense with increasing cycles after cyclic loading the ultimate lateral capacity was 4 mn using a criterion that the load corresponding to the intersection of the two tangents of the elastic stage and failure stage the increased vertical displacement indicated that the batter piled wharf was raised under monotonic lateral pulling 2 the residual pore pressure was positive and the corresponding magnitude was small over time in the seabed soil however the residual pore pressure and corresponding magnitude increased evidently over time around the double plumb piles the enclosed hysteresis curve areas evidently increased with increasing cycles and lateral displacement while their backbones moved upward to large values owing to the closest distance from the loading point the pore pressure around the single plumb pile was smaller than that around the double plumb piles but larger than that in the seabed soil because the soil shearing and remolding was slighter than that around double plumb piles the pore pressure in the upper soil was greater than that in the lower soil between the batter piles and the pore pressure values were smaller than those registered around the front piles 3 the residual soil pressures exhibited a constant decreasing increasing or increasing decreasing tendency over time at the upper soil around the double plumb pile whereas they exhibited an increasing or increasing decreasing tendency over time at the upper soil around the single plumb pile the increase or decrease of soil pressure depends on the balance of pore pressure redistribution and soil reconsolidation at the upper soil the lower soil pressure first slightly increased and then decreased or showed constant decreasing tendency over time because the pore pressure generated by cyclic loading was canceled out by the seepage initially pore pressures were accumulated around piles to induce soil strength degradation due to poor drainage conditions resulting in a decreasing soil pressure 4 the plumb piles exhibited waterside curvature in the upper part the bending moment around the pile head was evidently larger for the double plumb piles due to the front pile s shadowing effect over the rear pile the bending moment around the pile head was smaller than that around the front double plumb pile for the single plumb pile but larger than that around the rear double plumb pile the bending moment around batter pile heads was larger than that around plumb piles and the backward batter pile seemed to bear the largest bending moment around the pile head the bending moment exhibited a waterside curvature along with the whole forward batter pile because of the soil settlement induced by pore pressure accumulation and soil degradation the backward batter pile was more affected by the lateral load at the beginning of cyclic loading and the bending moment was positive in the upper part and negative in the lower part however the bending moment increased over time and the landside curvature tended to relieve influenced by the soil settlement data availability statement some or all data models or code that support the findings of this study are available from the

20922,this article investigates bearing behaviors of a batter piled wharf subjected to cyclic episodes of lateral loading with varying amplitude through two way displacement controlled centrifuge modeling results show that the lateral load vibrated around residual values and deviated toward waterside lateral stiffness exhibited degradation with increasing cycles in each constant magnitude sequence the residual vertical displacement kept decreasing and tended to become constant over time the residual pore pressure was positive in the seabed soil and around piles over time the soil around double plumb piles registered larger residual pore pressure and magnitudes than other areas the increase or decrease of soil pressure depends on the balance of pore pressure redistribution and soil reconsolidation in the upper soil and the lower soil registered decreasing soil pressures owing to poor drainage condition induced soil softening plumb piles exhibited waterside curvature in the upper part and the bending moment around the front double plumb pile head was larger than other plumb piles the whole forward batter pile exhibited waterside curvature induced by the soil settlement while the backward batter pile bore the largest bending moment around the pile head and its landside curvature tended to relieve affected by the soil settlement keywords centrifuge modeling batter piled wharf lateral cyclic loading bearing behavior 1 introduction pile supported wharfs are widely used in coastal areas for ship berthing and providing handling sites for portal cranes chiou et al 2011 in soft clay conditions in particular code of china 2010 xie et al 2015 the wharfs front and rear are equipped with double plumb and batter piles see fig 1 to improve the lateral load capacity considering that the single plumb pile s lateral load bearing capacity is limited xie et al 2017 however cyclic lateral loads induced by ship mooring and breasting is still a major concern fan and yuan 2014 yan et al 2020c zhang et al 2015 which will transmit from the superstructure to piles and then to the foundation the stiffness of the lateral response is affected by the cyclic loading zhang et al 2011 zhang and ng 2017 which further affects the cyclic strains and therefore induces fatigue damage that accumulates within both the pile itself and the superstructures andres and paul 2015 as shown in fig 2 the ultimate lateral bearing capacity of the pile supported wharf after cyclic loading must be estimated to ensure that the foundation has sufficient strength in an extreme loading event code of china 2010 zhang et al 2011 previous researchers investigated the lateral static performance of the pile supported wharf using analytical or numerical methods fayyazi et al 2014 investigated the group reduction factors for analysis of laterally loaded pile groups effects of pile spacing pile head condition and soil s friction angle andres and paul 2015 analyzed the elastic stability of idealized plumb pile supported structures which took the coupling between the pile s flexural stiffness lateral stiffness of the surrounding soil and factored gravity loads into consideration wang and he 2017 investigated the lateral static characteristics of a plumb pile supported wharf using finite element methods and proposed simplified methods of calculating the structural displacement they all neglected the effect of the batter piles which induced the torsion of the pile supported wharf under lateral loads and might lead to a large difference in structural bearing behaviors xie et al 2017 built finite element models of a pile supported wharf in the finite element software ansys to investigate the lateral loading behavior and parametric analyzes on the working behavior of batter piled wharf with varying slopes section sizes and load levels being performed compared with the theoretical analysis and the finite element method large scale or prototype tests of pile supported wharfs remain scarce owing to the large equipment costs and technological challenges therefore only a few small scale and centrifuge tests were conducted kawamata 2009 investigated the pile soil interaction of full scale single or capped piles in rockfill by performing a series of lateral load tests to obtain the relationship between the lateral load and the displacement taghavi et al 2015 conducted a series of centrifuge tests to investigate laterally loaded capped pile groups behavior in improved and unimproved soft clay test results revealed that cement deep soil mixing is an effective method to increase the lateral resistance of pile foundations by comparing the lateral resistance however in structural configuration the pile supported wharf is more complicated than single or capped piles yan et al 2020c performed centrifuge tests to investigate the bent displacement the bending moment of a defective pile supported wharf a static lateral load was applied on the pile supported wharf and numerical models were employed to back analyze the centrifuge test which provided design aids for the reinforcement project previous literature reviews also investigated the pile supported wharf s seismic performance in addition to these static lateral assessments chiou et al 2011 and yang et al 2012 developed fragility curves for a pile supported wharf using the capacity spectrum or finite element methods shafieezadeh et al 2012a b conducted 2d and 3d nonlinear seismic analyses of a typical pile supported wharf the results showed that a 2d wharf representation might not fully account for dynamic 3d response characteristics su et al 2017 revealed the pile ground and pile to pile interaction mechanisms salient characteristics by employing a full 3d finite element simulation framework takahashi and takemura 2015 carried out centrifuge model tests to investigate the seismic failure mechanism of a pile supported wharf in front of backfilled gravity type caissons and the effects of liquefaction in the backfill and underlying sand layer on the permanent deformation of the wharf were emphasized and the interaction between piled deck and caisson during the earthquake was measured mccullough et al 2007 employed five pile supported wharf models to measure their seismic performances subjected to recorded acceleration time histories the prototype wharf configurations were very common in the united states although the above large amount of works have been done on the static lateral souri et al 2015 and seismic performances su et al 2014 of a pile supported wharf few types of research have focused on the cyclic lateral behaviors of a batter piled wharf confronting with ship mooring and breasting considering they are the greatest in magnitude and most frequent in particular in the open sea zhang et al 2015 have found that the vibration period of a plumb piled wharf under cyclic loading is longer than that of a batter piled wharf and is much closer to the period of the loading wave through the numerical method and then examined the cyclic response of a plumb piled wharf which found that cyclic amplification of the structure is evident and established a simplified numerical method for calculating the structural displacement response regardless of the huge difference between plumb piled and batter piled wharfs this is far from adequate to evaluate the cyclic structure soil interaction because the remolding and softening of the surrounding soil will degrade the pile soil stiffness as indicated by the cyclic lateral response of a pile in soft clay zhang et al 2011 zhang and ng 2017 and batter piles will alter the stress path and displacement mode of the pile supported wharf yan et al 2020c therefore this article investigated a batter piled wharf s bearing behaviors under lateral cyclic loading through centrifuge modeling a 1 50 scale model was employed e g the centrifuge model was run at 50 g g is the gravity acceleration and the prototype was a five row batter piled wharf that was the front part of a pile supported wharf configuration a series of two way displacement controlled cycles were applied and a large displacement was pulled out of the batter piled wharf to obtain the ultimate lateral capacity the bent displacement pore and soil pressures and bending moment in this loading process were monitored 2 test program 2 1 soil sample preparation an overview of the test package is shown in fig 3 the centrifuge model test was conducted at 50 g in tk c500 in tianjin china details of the centrifuge have been described by yan et al 2020c earlier a schematic diagram of the centrifuge model setup is depicted in fig 4 the strong container used in the test has an internal dimension of 1200 mm in length 1000 mm in width and 1200 mm in depth the strong container was first filled with water and then sand was rained into it at a constant flow rate from a rainer to form a uniform underlying sand layer and the sand density was increased by increasing the height of the fall kaolin clay slurry with a water content of 120 was then added to cover the sand layer the rigid container was then slowly filled with de aired water from the bottom and exceeded 10 cm over the soil surface the soil parameters are listed in table 1 consolidation was performed in a consolidometer and loading weights were applied in a step incremental manner under 1 g condition after approximately 20 days the settlement stopped to increase and the container was moved on the centrifuge at an acceleration of 100 g to obtain overconsolidated clay whose strength increased with depth after the preloading process part of the upper kaolin clay was excavated to form the slope and the seabed gradually with great care reduced soil disturbance and avoided excessive excavations the excavation was manually conducted because the robot excavator and heavy liquid method ong et al 2006 were difficult to implement particularly for bent installation the soil was reconsolidated with an acceleration of 100 g to create the overconsolidated clay sample with a slope of 1 3 the lengths of the model seabed and berm were 610 mm and 110 mm respectively the thickness of the fengpu sand was 200 mm and the thickness of the kaolin clay ranged from 340 mm to 500 mm indicating that the fall from berm to the seabed was 160 mm the vane shear strength was monitored before and after the formal test as shown in fig 5 for the seabed and interface soil the vane shear strengths exhibited a generally uniform distribution in the upper soil but linearly increased with soil depth in the lower soil before the test however the vane shear strength increased in the seabed soil probably owing to the reconsolidation and decreased in the upper interface soil due to soil degradation after the test for the berm soil the vane shear strength decreased in the upper part and increased in the lower part with soil depth before the test which was attributed to the stress relief induced by excavation and the effect of consolidation but decreased in the middle soil and increased in the lower soil after the test the soil strength comparison before and after the test indicated that soil strength might continue to increase and the cyclic loading on the batter piled wharf affected the soil status 2 2 model bent the bent model follows a prototype in tianjin port which possessed a slab girders one row of double plumb piles in the waterside one row of middle single piles and two rows of forward and backward batter piles in the landside as shown in fig 3 b because minor errors in model dimensions may result in great differences the equivalence principle of bending stiffness and the model preparation technique were both considered in the model preparation yan et al 2020a and thus the bent model may not exactly correspond to the prototype fig 4 depicts the dimensions of the bent components the model slab dimensions were 250 mm in length 440 4 mm in width and 7 5 mm in height both lengthwise girders and widthwise girders were used and their lengths were 105 mm and 140 mm respectively the plumb and batter piles were different in dimensions the plumb piles section size was 11 mm 11 mm with a hollow wall thickness of 0 65 mm while the batter piles were 10 mm 10 mm with a hollow wall thickness of 0 60 mm in comparison the dimensions of the prototype plumb piles were 0 55 m 0 55 m with hollows of 0 30 m 0 30 m while the dimensions of the prototype batter piles were 0 50 m 0 50 m with hollows of 0 27 m 0 27 m the oblique angle of the batter piles was 25 24 and the torsional angle was 45 after the preparation of the model the bent model was installed at the designated location of the container the pile tips were 309 2 mm distance to the container bottom and the batter pile tips were 141 2 mm distance to the container wall thus the boundary conditions have little effects on the structure soil interaction yan et al 2019 2 3 transducer layout fig 6 depicts the layout of piles and transducer ids in the test two displacement laser sensors lss were employed to measure the lateral and vertical displacement in the front of the bent and another one was used to monitor the vertical displacement in the middle thus the tilting condition could be derived with these displacements to better present the transducers layout the front and rear double plumb piles were numbered as p1 and p2 the middle plumb pile was numbered as p3 and the forward and backward batter piles were numbered as p4 and p5 respectively five pore pressure transducers ppts were embedded in the seabed soil in the soil around p1 and p3 and in the soil between p4 and p5 and the ppts doted as ppt1 ppt5 six soil pressure transducers spts were evenly distributed every 4 cm around the p1 and the p3 respectively and were noted as spt1 spt12 thus the soil pressure distributions could be derived five strain gauges were evenly distributed on the plumb and batter piles and these sgs on every pile were consecutively numbered from head to bottom for example no 1 2 represented the second sg on p 1 no 2 3 represented the third sg on p 2 and so forth the sgs on the piles were wiped with epoxy resin to protect the sgs from destruction during the test 2 4 test setup a hydraulic loading device was installed on the container after the container was moved to the centrifuge table payload mounting area a servo valve controlled cylinder drove the loading device and the velocity ranged from 0 006 20 mm s the loading point was selected at the front of the slab and connected to the loading device with high strength connections water was added approximately 12 cm above the seabed surface to guarantee enough berthing draft corresponding to 6 m in the prototype the centrifuge spuds up from 1 g to 50 g after loading device installation and water addition and this process lasted 4 h the variation in the slope was very slight during the centrifuge acceleration from 1 g to 50 g two way displacement controlled cycles were imposed and then a large displacement was applied to obtain the ultimate lateral capacity after the cyclic displacement phase the loading device s velocity was 0 5 mm s in the test that is sufficient to ensure undrained conditions the cyclic loading process involved consecutive packets of 20 cycles for each sequence from seq1 to seq4 with increasing amplitude from y d 0 25 to y d 1 0 y represents the amplitude of the applied lateral displacement d represents the pile diameter of the battered pile to identify the influence of previous cyclic movements corresponding to 0 125 m 0 25 m 0 375 m and 0 50 m in the prototype the final load step was terminated after the lateral displacement reached 1 25 m under the large monotonic displacement a large enough displacement from the functional point of view yan et al 2020a in the following section test results are depicted in the prototype scale following the centrifuge principles taylor 1995 3 test results 3 1 load and displacement behaviors the time histories of lateral displacements are presented in fig 7 which showed that the applied lateral displacement corresponded well with the designated revealing that the hydraulic loading device has reliable performance full two way horizontal displacement cycles were performed with amplitudes from y d 0 25 to y d 1 0 and the corresponding loading time were 11 57 days for seq1 23 15 days for seq2 34 72 days for seq3 46 30 days for seq4 and 1 45 days for monotonic loading 117 19 days in total the actual loading time was slightly longer than designated because the loading arm flexure adjustment was considered in the test the time histories of applied lateral loads are shown in fig 8 the lateral loads vibrated around the residual value mean value of the maximum and minimum lateral loads and deviated toward waterside due to batter piles layout the batter piled wharf tilted toward the waterside under lateral pulling loads yan et al 2020c and the remolding was easier toward the waterside due to the slope the residual lateral loads fell quickly to negative values in seq1 and the falling tendency became gentle in seq2 to seq4 indicating that the soil strength decreases sharply when the pile first begins to remold that zone of the soil a relatively progressive degradation occurs in the later cycles until the soil strength stabilizes after many cycles wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 fig 9 shows details of the maximum residual and minimum lateral load tendencies versus cycles in these sequences the maximum and minimum lateral loads generally decreased in every sequence but increased in magnitude from seq1 to seq4 owing to the magnitude variations in lateral displacement although the residual lateral loads in the first few cycles were greater than that in the last few cycles of the former sequence hamilton and murff 1995 generally reducing residual lateral loads were observed with increasing cycles fig 10 shows the lateral load deflection curve and the development of secant lateral stiffness versus cycle numbers the stiffness shows degradation with increasing cycles in every sequence that possessed a constant magnitude this phenomenon can be linked to the strain softening soil behavior and the zone of soil that is influenced as the pile moves laterally the reduction in soil strength and stiffness from remolding during any previous loading history softens the pile soil response when the pile is pushed toward the failure condition zhou and randolph 2009 and this effect is countered by any recovery from reconsolidation an alternative mechanism that can also reduce the stiffness during cyclic loading is the opening of a gap around piles murff and hamilton 1993 zhang et al 2011 there was a generally reducing stiffness from seq1 to seq4 as the amplitude of horizontal displacement increased but the first stiffness is significantly higher than the cyclic stiffness observed on the former cyclic episode the extent of the pile resistant soil zone increased from seq1 to seq4 resulting in new soil being involved in the failure mechanism and soil being softened as cycles occurred wang et al 2018 2019 zhang and ng 2017 the degradation rate became smaller from seq1 to seq4 as observed in the hysteresis curve and the corresponding lateral stiffness curve indicating that many cycles of movement the cumulative increase in total strain and the consequent remolding of the local soil led to a reduction in the lateral resistance both of these effects are shown systematically by the selected displacement deflection curve more clearly and thus the effect of cycle numbers was elaborated as shown in fig 11 the vertical displacement histories and corresponding lateral load vertical displacement cycles in the front and middle of the slab are shown in fig 12 influenced by the increasing lateral displacement magnitude in different sequences the vertical displacement increased in magnitude the residual vertical displacement decreased and tended to become constant over time indicating that the bent sank into the soil due to soil softening and remolding yan et al 2018a the residual vertical displacement in the middle of the slab was greater than that in the slab s front which was attributed to the hydraulic loading device s constriction thus the overturning of the wharf was toward the landside which was some difference with practical conditions the lateral load vertical displacement curve tended to be dense with increasing vertical displacement in every sequence indicating that the vertical displacement increased strikingly at the beginning of every sequence the residual vertical displacement decreased to negative values when the residual lateral load deviated toward waterside and the lateral load vertical displacement curve also tended to be dense from seq1 to seq4 the phenomenon can be linked to a gain in the soil s strength immediately local to the pile following each episode of cyclic disturbance leading to pore pressure generation and reconsolidation leading to pore pressure dissipation and increasing soil density zhang et al 2011 the spatial extent of remolding is affected by the amplitude of preceding cycles and the extent of this remolding depends on the number of previous cycles displacement tendencies under monotonic lateral load after cyclic loading are depicted in fig 13 the lateral load exhibited a quick increase whereas the displacement slowly increased at the beginning the displacement of the bent increased quickly toward the waterside and the curve exhibited strong nonlinearity i e the lateral displacement became increasingly large with loading time indicating increasing soil plastic deformation and pile deformation wang et al 2018 the ultimate lateral capacity after cyclic loading can be determined using load displacement curves and the criterion that the load corresponding to the intersection of the two tangents of the elastic stage and failure stage was employed from the functional point of view yan et al 2020a the ultimate lateral load capacity after cyclic loading was 4 mn by comparison the vertical displacement increased indicating that the batter piled wharf was raised under monotonic lateral pulling the increment in the middle of the slab was greater than that in the front indicating the wharf tended to overturn toward the waterside under monotonic lateral pulling fig 14 presents the batter piled wharf s ultimate post cyclic failure mode after cyclic and monotonic pulling load in the centrifuge test the bent overturned toward the landside as indicated by the obliquely oriented slab and piles which was different from the failure mode under a pure pulling load yan et al 2020c the soil around the piles moved toward the waterside due to pile pushing and the pile soil interfaces on the landside separated in the test which reduced the lateral stiffness moreover many fissures see fig 14 b have been observed to develop on the slope in the rear of the backward batter pile which prevented them from transmitting their full pressures onto the pile ong et al 2003 2009 on the other hand this phenomenon has revealed that soil movement has occurred around the batter piled wharf by staking under monotonic load 3 2 pore pressure response the pore pressure response reflects the soil s effective stress conditions and provides key information on the influence of cycles on the soil status and progressive soil shearing ong et al 2006 ppt1 registered positive pore pressures in the seabed soil from seq1 to seq4 as shown in fig 15 a the residual pore pressure and the corresponding magnitude were small over time this is attributed to the location of ppt1 which is relatively far from the piles ong et al 2003 the cyclic loading was transferred from piles and surrounding soil the induced cyclic stress had abated at this location yan et al 2018a the maximum pore pressure was very close to the minimum pore pressure and the residual pore pressure showed an increasing constant tendency with residual lateral load indicating a positive correlation between the pore pressure and residual lateral load although the lateral displacement magnitude increased from seq1 to seq4 it is found that the residual pore pressure only slightly increased with lateral displacement and cycles whereas the magnitude varied little unlike ppt1 ppt2 registered both positive and negative pore pressures around p1 through the cyclic loading process in fig 15 b the residual pore pressure and corresponding magnitude increased evidently over time and maximum values in seq4 were approximately 30 kpa which was evidently greater than those in seabed soil the maximum and residual pore pressures increased whereas the minimum pore pressures first increased then decreased with the increasing residual lateral load this is because the soil around p1 was most affected by the lateral load due to the closest distance to the loading point yan et al 2018a b the soil generated positive pore pressure due to the cyclic progressive undrained shearing and remolding of clay although seepage occurred and pore pressure redistributed over time the negative pore pressure was too small to cancel out the positive pore pressure ong et al 2003 2009 the enclosed hysteresis curve areas evidently increased with increasing cycles and lateral displacement and their backbones curves through peak points of the selected cycles moved upward to large values which elaborated the increasing residual pore pressure and magnitude tendencies ppt3 registered positive pore pressures whose residual values increased over time and pore pressures seemed to have large magnitudes in seq2 and seq3 in fig 15 c the pore pressure first increased slowly with a residual lateral load but then increased at a larger rate the maximum pore pressure was approximately 12 kpa which was smaller than ppt2 but larger than ppt1 indicating the soil shearing and remolding around p3 was slighter than around p1 due to its spatial effect and the loading point yan et al 2018a b the backbones of enclosed hysteresis curves moved upward to large values with increasing cycles and the pore pressure magnitudes slightly varied with lateral displacement ppt4 and ppt5 registered pore pressures in the soil between p4 and p5 and the results are presented in fig 15 d e the pore pressure registered by ppt4 was smaller than that registered by ppt5 indicating that the upper soil was more affected by the cyclic stress induced by the spatial effect of batter piles yan et al 2018a however because of a relatively far distance of ppt4 and ppt5 to the loading point pore pressure values were smaller than those registered by ppt2 and ppt3 the pore pressure magnitude increased from seq1 to seq4 whereas the residual pore pressure only slightly increased at the beginning of the cyclic loading but remained almost constant over time correspondingly the maximum and minimum pore pressures increased and decreased respectively the backbones of enclosed hysteresis curves seemed to coincide with increasing cycles and the pore pressure magnitudes slightly varied with lateral displacement 3 3 soil pressure response the soil pressure response reflected the displacement behaviors of the piles and structure soil interactions lian et al 2014 yan et al 2019 furthermore the soil status can be qualitatively derived by associating the soil pressure with the pore pressure soil pressures around p1 are presented in fig 16 a and the locations of spts are marked on the inset spt1 was located at 13 35 m from the pile head and it registered a constant decreasing increasing soil pressure tendency over time the soil pressure varied little at small residual lateral load but became negative at large lateral load magnitude by comparison spt2 registered positive soil pressures over time which exhibited an increasing decreasing tendency at 15 35 m from the pile head also this is because spt1 and spt2 were located near the slope surface to obtain drainage channels and it is more convenient for the pore pressure to dissipate and the soil to reconsolidate ong et al 2006 yan et al 2018a when the soil pressure increased thus to increase the soil density and strength at these locations zhang et al 2011 however when a large amount of pore pressure continued to generate due to the cyclic loading taken spt2 as an example the soil strength might degrade and soil pressure started to fall therefore the increase or decrease depends on the balance of pore pressure redistribution and soil reconsolidation following this soil pressures of spt7 see fig 16 b exhibited an increasing tendency over time and seemed to possess relatively constant magnitude with increasing lateral load spt8 soil pressures increased first then decreased to negative values over time and residual lateral load notably soil pressures of spt7 and spt8 were located at 11 35 m and 13 35 m from the pile head of p2 the soil pressure of spt3 and spt4 at 17 35 m and 19 35 m from the pile head of p1 first slightly increased and then decreased over time and residual lateral load and the soil pressures obtained large magnitude from seq1 to seq4 indicating the soil pressures were sensitive to lateral displacement magnitude variations by comparison the soil pressures around the bottom of p1 see fig 16 a and middle and bottom of p2 see fig 16 b both showed constant decreasing tendency over time and residual lateral load the inspired soil pressures were small in magnitude this is because the seepage cancelled out the pore pressure generated by cyclic loading at the beginning ong et al 2006 however the soft clay was in poor drainage and the drainage channel was not practical because of the far distance to the slope surface and boundaries yan et al 2018a thus pore pressures were accumulated around piles to induce soil strength degradation liao et al 2019 yan et al 2018b the effective stress was lessened resulting in a decreasing soil pressure because the cyclic stress transferred to the middle and lower soil was relatively small the soil pressure magnitudes were correspondingly small fig 17 shows the selected soil pressure cycles around p1 and p3 the backbones of enclosed hysteresis curves moved downward to large negative pressures with increasing cycles at 17 35 m from the pile head of p1 and the soil pressure magnitudes increased evidently with lateral displacement the hysteretic curve showed the residual soil pressure varied little but the magnitude increased evidently with increasing cycles at 19 35 m from the pile head of p2 indicated by the increasing slopes of the backbones by comparison the backbones of enclosed hysteresis curves slightly moved downward indicating a decreasing soil pressure with increasing cycles and lateral displacement at 15 35 m and 17 35 m from the pile head of p3 it is found that the soil pressure magnitudes varied strikingly around p1 than those around p3 at approximately the same elevations which is attributed to the more intense cyclic stress transferred from the loading point yan et al 2018a the selected soil pressure cycles also revealed that the soil was degraded due to the accumulation of pore pressure 3 4 bending moment response pile bending moment derived from pile strains ko et al 2018 li et al 2016 can reflect a batter piled wharf s structural stress and deformation conditions zhang et al 2011 in the following section the positive bending moment corresponds to waterside curvature and vice versa the bending moment histories of p1 are presented in fig 18 a the bending moment increased rapidly over time in seq1 and this increasing tendency tended to be gentle from seq2 to seq4 at 1 75 m from the pile head whereas the bending moment kept increasing with the residual lateral load the bending moment response was intense because it was more easily affected by the cyclic stress li et al 2016 by comparison the bending moment increased over time and residual lateral load but the increment was small at 5 75 m and 9 75 m from the pile head the residual bending moment below 13 75 m from the pile head generally remained constant or slightly became negative over time and with residual lateral load yan et al 2019 therefore waterside curvature occurred in the upper part of p1 under cyclic loading and the lower part was a little influenced the phenomenon was also found in a pile supported wharf subjected to pulling load and the residual lateral load was considered to be responsible for this phenomenon yan et al 2020c fig 18 b depicts the bending moment histories of p2 the residual bending moment increased in seq1 and seq2 but fell to negative values in seq3 and seq4 at 1 75 m from the pile head this reduction compared to p1 1 was also reflected in the bending moment and residual lateral load relations and was attributed to the shadowing effect of p1 over p2 during cyclic loading the fall of the residual bending moment was probably attributed to some form of rotational degree of freedom relaxation that might have occurred ong et al 2009 the bending moments became slightly positive at 5 75 m and 9 75 m from the pile head and generally remained constant below 13 75 m from the pile head the bending moment magnitudes were larger at 13 75 m and 17 75 m from the pile head of p1 and p2 than that at other locations and seemed to gain stronger responses versus residual lateral load attributed to the intense pile soil interaction ong et al 2015 yan et al 2020c selected bending moment cycles of p1 and p2 are shown in fig 19 the backbones moved up to large bending moment values with cycles and the slope of the backbones varied evidently at 1 75 m from the pile head of p1 by comparison the backbones slightly moved to small bending moment values with cycles and the slopes of backbones were only slightly different at 1 75 m from the pile head of p2 thus demonstrating the shadowing effect of the front pile over the rear pile ong et al 2015 yan et al 2020b the backbone curve of the selected cycles became close to each other with increasing cycles at 13 75 m from pile heads of p1 and p2 and the slope of the backbone showed a decreasing tendency with cycles that is the bending moment magnitudes increased first and subsequently became constant versus the increasing lateral displacement in different sequences however the residual bending moment generally remained constant which corresponded with the abovementioned results fig 20 depicts the bending moment histories and selected bending moment cycles of p3 the maximum bending moment first increased rapidly then tended to be constant over time at 1 75 m from the pile head whereas the minimum bending moment increased in every single sequence but decreased from seq1 to seq4 as a result the residual bending moment was positive and exhibited an increasing decreasing tendency versus residual lateral load the backbones slightly varied from seq1 to seq4 and the magnitude increased with cycles and lateral displacement the residual bending moment was smaller compared to p1 1 because of its relatively far distance from the loading point and the shadowing effect of the front pile over the rear pile the residual bending moments were positive and exhibited an increasing constant tendency over time at 5 75 m and 9 75 m from the pile head whereas they were generally constant over time and with residual lateral load at 13 75 m and 17 75 m from the pile head however their magnitude became larger than those at other elevations and became larger from seq1 to seq4 which was attributed to the pile soil interaction similar to the phenomenon observed in p1 yan et al 2020c zhang et al 2011 the backbone curves were approximately linear with increasing cycles and the bending moment magnitude was sensitive to increasing lateral displacement this indicated that p3 also exhibited a waterside curvature in the upper part but to a lesser extent than p1 fig 21 depicts the bending moment histories of p4 and p5 the residual bending moment increased over time and the corresponding magnitudes also increased from seq1 to seq4 at 2 6 m from the pile head of p4 the bending moment exhibited increasing or increasing decreasing tendency and was positive over time and with residual lateral load at 7 0 m 20 15 m from the pile head of p4 but in smaller values compared to that at 2 6 m from the pile head indicating p4 exhibited a waterside curvature along with the whole pile the reason can be attributed to the soil settlement induced by pore pressure accumulation and soil degradation yan et al 2018a b which pushed the batter pile to exhibit a simple curvature toward waterside however when the settlement tended to be stable the bending moment reduced and this waterside curvature was relieved the bending moment increased evidently over time and the magnitude kept increasing from seq1 to seq4 at 2 60 m from the pile head of p5 the maximum bending moment was approximately 3 5 mn m and the residual bending moment increased rapidly at large residual lateral load the bending moment around batter pile heads was larger than that around plumb piles and the forward batter pile seemed to bear the largest bending moment around the pile head this conclusion corresponded with the phenomenon that the backward batter pile is more easily defected in practical engineering li et al 2018 because of the large bending moment induced eccentric compression at the pile head the different cyclic stress distributions induced by the lateral load and batter piles layout were responsible for the phenomenon the bending moment showed similar increasing tendencies at 7 0 m from the pile head of p5 compared to those around the pile head but in a smaller magnitude the bending moment first decreased then increased over time and residual lateral load at 11 40 m 20 15 m from the pile head of p5 further p5 exhibited waterside curvature at 11 40 m from the pile head but landside curvature at 15 75 m and 20 15 m from the pile head this bending moment distribution revealed that p5 was more affected by the lateral load at the beginning of cyclic loading and the bending moment was positive in the upper part and negative in the lower part yan et al 2020b however the bending moment increased and the landside curvature tended to relieve influenced by the soil settlement because of the pile soil interaction the bending moment magnitudes at 11 40 m and 15 75 m were also larger than those at other elevations giannakou et al 2010 selected bending moment cycles of p4 and p5 are shown in fig 22 the backbones moved up to large values and the magnitude evidently increased with increasing cycles and lateral displacement at 2 60 m from the pile heads of p4 and p5 by comparison the backbones moved up to small values or reduced to negative values with increasing cycles and lateral displacement at 15 57 m from the pile heads of p4 and p5 respectively thus the differences induced by lateral displacement variations were elaborated clearly 4 conclusions this article demonstrated the centrifuge lateral cyclic bearing behaviors of a batter piled wharf in terms of bent displacement pore and soil pressures and bending moment the model s scale was 1 50 and the prototype was a batter piled wharf in tianjin port china two way displacement controlled cycles involved a consecutive packet of 20 cycles for each sequence from seq1 to seq4 with increasing amplitude from y d 0 25 to y d 1 0 y represents the amplitude of the applied lateral displacement d represents the pile diameter of the batter pile was applied a final load step was terminated immediately after the batter piled wharf s lateral displacement exceeded 1 25 m in prototype scale under the large monotonic displacement the main conclusions are as follows 1 the lateral loads vibrated around the residual value the mean value of maximum and minimum lateral loads and deviated toward waterside due to batter piles layout although the maximum and minimum lateral loads generally decreased in every sequence but increased in magnitude from seq1 to seq4 the residual lateral loads generally decreased the cyclic test involving cycles of increasing amplitude showed that the lateral stiffness exhibited degradation with increasing cycles in every sequence that possessed a constant magnitude however the first stiffness is significantly higher than the cyclic stiffness observed on the former cyclic episode while the amplitude of the cyclic movement increased the residual vertical displacement kept decreasing and tended to become constant over time indicating that the bent sank into the soil due to soil softening and remolding which affected the batter piles bending moment distributions the residual vertical displacement in the middle of the slab was greater than the slab s front and in this study the wharf overturned toward the landside the residual vertical displacement decreased to negative values when the residual lateral loads deviated toward waterside and the lateral load vertical displacement curve also tended to be dense with increasing cycles after cyclic loading the ultimate lateral capacity was 4 mn using a criterion that the load corresponding to the intersection of the two tangents of the elastic stage and failure stage the increased vertical displacement indicated that the batter piled wharf was raised under monotonic lateral pulling 2 the residual pore pressure was positive and the corresponding magnitude was small over time in the seabed soil however the residual pore pressure and corresponding magnitude increased evidently over time around the double plumb piles the enclosed hysteresis curve areas evidently increased with increasing cycles and lateral displacement while their backbones moved upward to large values owing to the closest distance from the loading point the pore pressure around the single plumb pile was smaller than that around the double plumb piles but larger than that in the seabed soil because the soil shearing and remolding was slighter than that around double plumb piles the pore pressure in the upper soil was greater than that in the lower soil between the batter piles and the pore pressure values were smaller than those registered around the front piles 3 the residual soil pressures exhibited a constant decreasing increasing or increasing decreasing tendency over time at the upper soil around the double plumb pile whereas they exhibited an increasing or increasing decreasing tendency over time at the upper soil around the single plumb pile the increase or decrease of soil pressure depends on the balance of pore pressure redistribution and soil reconsolidation at the upper soil the lower soil pressure first slightly increased and then decreased or showed constant decreasing tendency over time because the pore pressure generated by cyclic loading was canceled out by the seepage initially pore pressures were accumulated around piles to induce soil strength degradation due to poor drainage conditions resulting in a decreasing soil pressure 4 the plumb piles exhibited waterside curvature in the upper part the bending moment around the pile head was evidently larger for the double plumb piles due to the front pile s shadowing effect over the rear pile the bending moment around the pile head was smaller than that around the front double plumb pile for the single plumb pile but larger than that around the rear double plumb pile the bending moment around batter pile heads was larger than that around plumb piles and the backward batter pile seemed to bear the largest bending moment around the pile head the bending moment exhibited a waterside curvature along with the whole forward batter pile because of the soil settlement induced by pore pressure accumulation and soil degradation the backward batter pile was more affected by the lateral load at the beginning of cyclic loading and the bending moment was positive in the upper part and negative in the lower part however the bending moment increased over time and the landside curvature tended to relieve influenced by the soil settlement data availability statement some or all data models or code that support the findings of this study are available from the

20923,the aim of this paper is to address the leader follower formation control problem for a group of underactuated unmanned surface vehicles usvs with non diagonal inertia matrix subject to modeling uncertainties and limited sensing capabilities no communication is required among the usvs but every usv is only equipped with on board sensors to measure the line of sight los range and the relative bearing angle the connectivity preserving constraint arisen from the limited sensing capability and the collision avoidance constraint resulting from the safety requirement are imposed on the los range and the relative bearing angle between every follower and its leader these constraints are subsequently incorporated into the tan type barrier lyapunov function based formation control design every usv reconstructs the velocity of its leader using the high gain observer based solely on the available los range and relative bearing angle based on coordinate transformation backstepping procedure dynamic surface control dsc technique and neural network approximation a singularity free formation controller is then developed which guarantees the boundedness of all the closed loop system signals and achieves satisfaction of prescribed performance specifications on the formation errors simulations are performed to verify the effectiveness of the formation control strategy keywords underactuated usvs formation control collision and connectivity constraints prescribed performance 1 introduction the most recent years have witnessed the increasing deployment of multiple unmanned vehicles instead of a single vehicle to perform various maritime tasks such as environmental monitoring search and rescue and ocean resource exploration fahimi 2007 cui et al 2010 liu et al 2016 peng et al 2021 limited energy and coverage of the unmanned vehicle make it challenging to accomplish these tasks within reasonable time and cost using a single vehicle gao and guo 2019 the robustness against the system faults is another weakness comparing with multi vehicle system jin 2016 consequently cooperation of a group of vehicles is more desirable when executing these missions where the coordinated operation of the vehicle group is an important part of the cooperation in general the coordinated operation could be divided into guidance navigation and control of the vehicle group liu et al 2016 thus cooperative control of multiple unmanned surface vehicles usvs is practically motivated in which cooperative formation control of multi vehicle system has attracted considerable attention in control and marine engineering communities during the past two decades arrichiello et al 2006 dong and farrell 2008 sun et al 2018 ghommam and saad 2018 xie et al 2018 lu et al 2018 he et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 lu et al 2020 in practical applications most of the usvs equipped without independent sway actuator belong to a class of underactuated systems which means that the usvs have three degrees of freedom to be controlled but have only two independent control inputs do and pan 2009 dai et al 2019 under this typical configuration designing formation control laws for each individual vehicle to achieve the desired formation shape and simultaneously stabilize the sway dynamics is challenging and important in jin 2016 a formation control strategy for a group of underactuated surface vessels is proposed by controlling the line of sight los range and angle between the follower and its leader to deal with the underactuation where the passive boundedness assumption proposed in li et al 2008 is employed to ensure the boundedness of the sway velocity based on the transverse function approach morin and samson 2003 a dynamic oscillator also called as additional control input is introduced to stabilize the sway dynamics do 2012 where the potential functions are incorporated into the formation control design to guarantee no collisions among the underactuated ships the authors in gu et al 2019 employ the auxiliary variable approach to overcome the difficulty caused by underactuation so as to achieve the containment maneuvering of a group of underactuated surface vehicles to achieve a desired formation shape the usvs are typically equipped with onboard sensors to interact with their neighboring vehicles while the sensing capability of the onboard sensors is often limited for example a fixed stereo camera is generally subject to the field of view constraint and the on board wireless communication device e g wi fi is often subject to limited communication range kan et al 2019 dai et al 2020b under the physical limitation of the onboard sensors it is important to guarantee the connectivity among the vehicles since any connectivity break would lead to failure of establishment of the formation at the initial stage and destruction of the formation during the motion when preserving the connectivity among the vehicles avoiding the collisions among the vehicles is also significant because the collision would cause damage of the vehicles resulting in economic loss and failure of the task abdelaal et al 2018 as a result the connectivity preserving constraint arisen from the limited sensing capability of the onboard sensors and the collision avoidance constraint resulting from the safety requirement are of practically interest during the formation control design a fuzzy logic based collision avoidance algorithm is proposed in hinostroza et al 2019 to achieve cooperative operation of multiple fully actuated usvs in leader follower formation structure in liang et al 2020 the repulsive potential function is employed to avoid the collision among the usvs and the virtual swarm center is designed to keep all usvs connected in the group but the stability of the sway dynamics is neglected a distributed path guided formation control strategy is proposed in peng et al 2019 where the artificial potential functions are applied to avoid the collisions among the vehicles and preserve the initial network connectivity incorporating the path generation and potential functions into the model predictive control the collision avoidance and connectivity maintenance among the autonomous underactuated surface vehicles are guaranteed in tran et al 2020 although the previous works hinostroza et al 2019 liang et al 2020 peng et al 2019 tran et al 2020 provide efficient methods to address the problems of collision avoidance and connectivity preservation they could not achieve pre determined formation control performance indices regarding convergence rate maximum overshoot and steady residual set for the formation errors guaranteeing these performance indices is desirable in many practical applications since slow convergence rate and large maximum overshoot of the formation errors may result in increasing time of formation setup while a large steady state error would lead to imperfect formation and reduced accurate accomplishment of the task based on the above observation in this work we aim to address the formation control problem for a group of uncertain underactuated usvs with non diagonal inertia matrix subject to limited sensing capabilities under connectivity preservation and collision avoidance constraints each usv in the group is equipped with on board sensors to measure the los range and relative bearing angle this typical configuration can release the communication requirement thus the high gain observer is developed for every follower to reconstruct the velocity of its leader using only the available los range and relative bearing angle a coordinate transformation is introduced to overcome the difficulties caused by off diagonal system matrix the tan type barrier lyapunov functions are employed to guarantee the satisfaction of the connectivity preservation and collision avoidance constraints the modeling uncertainties are estimated by the neural networks nns and the dynamic surface control dsc technique is applied to avoid using the derivatives of virtual controls in the actual controllers comparing with jin 2016 the passive boundedness assumption is removed the inertia matrix of the vehicle is non diagonal and the predefined formation control performances are addressed explicitly in our work different from do 2012 gu et al 2019 hinostroza et al 2019 liang et al 2020 peng et al 2019 and tran et al 2020 our proposed formation control protocol requires no information exchange among the vehicles especially the imprecise velocity which is often derived from the position obtained by the global position system gps meanwhile our proposed formation control strategy can guarantee the prescribed transient and steady state performances of the formation errors which is the major difference between our work and do 2012 gu et al 2019 hinostroza et al 2019 liang et al 2020 peng et al 2019 and tran et al 2020 the technical contributions of our work are summarized as follows 1 the connectivity preservation and collision avoidance between every usv and its leader are achieved and the possible controller singularity problem is also avoided 2 by incorporating the tan type barrier functions the prescribed transient and steady state performances of the formation tracking errors are guaranteed despite the presence of modeling uncertainties 3 the feedback information about the leader is only the los range and relative bearing angle that are measured by the on board sensors of the follower based on the available los range and bearing angle the follower reconstructs the velocity of its leader by the high gain observer such that the communication is no longer required 2 problem formulation 2 1 usv dynamics consider a group of n underactuated usvs moving in a horizontal plane with index set n 1 n the kinematics of the i th usv is given by x i u i cos ψ i υ i sin ψ i 1 y i u i sin ψ i υ i cos ψ i ψ i r i with i n where η i x i y i ψ i t is the system output coordinated in the earth fixed frame o e x e y e with x i y i being the position and ψ i being the yaw angle and ν i u i υ i r i t coordinated in the body fixed frame o b x b y b denotes the vehicle velocity with u i υ i and r i being the corresponding velocities in surge sway and yaw respectively the kinetics of the i th vehicle dynamics is given by fossen 2002 2 m i ν i c ν i ν i d ν i ν i τ i where m i m i t 0 denotes the inertia matrix which can be determined using semi empirical methods or several software packages skjetne et al 2005 c ν i denotes the total coriolis and centripetal acceleration matrix d ν i is the damping matrix which is assumed to be unknown due to the inaccurate modeling bell et al 2020 wang et al 2017 and τ i τ u i 0 τ r i t denotes the control inputs with surge force τ u i and yaw moment τ r i the matrices m i c ν i and d ν i are given by m i m 11 i 0 0 0 m 22 i m 23 i 0 m 32 i m 33 i c ν i 0 0 c 13 i υ i r i 0 0 c 23 i u i c 13

vehicle center of gravity x u i y υ i y r i n r i are the added masses and x y n are the hydrodynamic damping coefficients 2 2 coordinate transformation of vehicle dynamics considering the off diagonal inertia matrix m i of the underactuated usv with system dynamics 2 the yaw moment control τ r i will act on the sway dynamics by directly expanding 2 as a result this direct interaction brings difficulty in designing the yaw moment control law to stabilize both sway and yaw dynamics simultaneously the following coordinate transformations are introduced to overcome this difficulty x i x i ε i cos ψ i 3 y i y i ε i sin ψ i υ i υ i ε i r i where ε i m 23 i m 22 i is a small constant since the off diagonal term m 23 i is small compared to the diagonal term m 22 i using coordinate

consider a leader follower formation consisting of n following vehicles and a virtual leader vehicle where the virtual leader moves along a predefined trajectory let η 0 x 0 y 0 ψ 0 t be the trajectory of the virtual leader with x 0 y 0 being the position and ψ 0 being the yaw angle in the leader follower formation there are many pairs of leaders and followers and each follower has a fixed leader the control objective is to design a formation control protocol for every follower such that the follower maintains a desired separation with its leader in the presence of limited sensing capability of the on board sensors the prescribed formation shape can be achieved if each follower in the group maintains the desired separation with its leader as such we can only just consider a pair of leader and follower and the leader is labeled as i 1 while the follower is labeled as i the basic leader follower formation architecture about a pair of leader and follower vehicles is shown in fig 1 the los range d i t and bearing angle θ i t between the follower and its leader as shown in fig 1 is defined as 5 d i t x i 1 x i 2 y i 1 y i 2 6 θ i t atan2 y i x i with x i y i cos ψ i sin ψ i sin ψ i cos ψ i x i 1 x i y i 1 y i where function atan2 y x returns the four quadrant inverse tangent of y and x see dai et al 2018 it should be noticed that the relative distance d i and relative bearing angle θ i are measured by the on board sensor of the i th usv due to the limited sensory capabilities of the on board sensor e g a fixed camera the relative bearing angle θ i should be restricted within the feasible region θ i θ i such that the leader is detectable for the follower where θ i and θ i denote the minimal and maximal detectable relative bearing angle for the follower respectively additionally the sensing range of the on board sensor is often limited to maintain the desired separation we consider the following relative distance and bearing angle constraints namely collision avoidance and connectivity maintenance constraints 7 d i c o l d i t d i c o n 8 θ i θ i t θ i where d i c o l denotes the safety distance and d i c o n d i c o n d i c o l 0 denotes the maximal sensing distance of the on board sensor mounted on the i th usv note that the control law given in 28 would be singular if θ i π 2 however this problem could be avoided by i guaranteeing the satisfaction of the constraint 8 through control design and ii appropriately designing the parameters θ i and θ i in 8 thus we provide a guideline for parameter selection i e 9 θ i π 2 θ i π 2 to guarantee non violation of constraints 7 and 8 the desired distance d i d e s and the desired bearing angle θ i d e s are introduced 10 e d i t d i t d i d e s 11 e θ i t θ i t θ i d e s where d i d e s d i c o l d i c o n 2 and θ i d e s θ i θ i 2 substituting 10 and 11 into 7 and 8 yields d i c o l d i d e s e d i t d i c o n d i d e s 12 θ i θ i d e s e θ i t θ i θ i d e s to provide transient performance specifications on the overall formation errors we further enforce prescribed performance constraints on the transient response of distance error e d i t and bearing angle error e θ i t in the formation control design that is the following time varying constraints are employed 13 β d i t e d i t β d i t β θ i t e θ i t β θ i t where β d i t and β d i t are the prescribed lower and upper bounds of error e d i t while β θ i t and β θ i t are the prescribed lower and upper bounds of error e θ i t the boundary functions β d i t and β θ i t are taken as β d i t β d i 0 β d i exp κ d i t β d i 14 β θ i t β θ i 0 β θ i exp κ θ i t β θ i with β d i 0 d i c o n d i d e s and β θ i 0 θ i θ i d e s where β e d i β θ i denote the allowable maximal values of the steady state formation errors and κ d i and κ θ i are designer specified positive constants note that eq 14 is also called as performance functions bechlioulis and rovithakis 2008 it is clear that if the constraint 13 with 14 is guaranteed by the controller then the constraint 12 is satisfied which indicates that the inequalities 7 and 8 hold assumption 1 the desired trajectory η 0 and its bounded derivative η 0 are provided to the leading vehicle 1 only the follower has no access to the leader s information and only the relative distance d i t and relative bearing angle θ i t between the follower i and its leader i 1 can be measured by the follower s onboard sensors assumption 2 at the initial time t 0 each usv is positioned at a given location that does not violate the collision and connectivity constraints i e it satisfies the conditions d i c o l d i 0 d i c o n and θ i θ i 0 θ i i n formation control objective under assumptions 1 2 the control objective is to design control law τ i for each vehicle i i n such that i each vehicle i tracks its leader vehicle i 1 with non violation of collision as well as connectivity constraints given in 7 and 8 during movement while avoiding the possible controller singularity problem and ii the prescribed transient and steady state performances of the formation errors e d i t and e θ i t in the sense of 13 and 14 is guaranteed 3 observer based formation control design under the constraint condition 13 in this section we present a constructive design technique of adaptive nn formation control that forces the follower to track its leader with desired separation to facilitate the discussion about the constraint condition 13 we introduce a tan type barrier lyapunov function 3 1 tan type barrier lyapunov functions we introduce a time varying tan type barrier lyapunov function as follows jin 2016 15 v z β z 2 π tan π z 2 2 β z 2 where z is the error that should satisfy the inequality β z t z β z t it follows from 15 that v z grows to infinity when the error z approaches the prescribed error bounds β z t and β z t therefore guaranteeing the boundedness of v z could guarantee non violation of the constraint β z t z β z t it is interesting to notice that when the error bound β z tends to infinity we could by l hospital s rule obtain lim β z β z 2 π tan π z 2 2 β z 2 1 2 z 2 which indicates that the tan type barrier lyapunov function 15 is a general approach that would also work in the situation where there is no constraint requirement considering eqs 5 and 6 and differentiating equations 10 and 11 obtain 16 e d i u i cos θ i υ i sin θ i p i 1 t r 1 i 17 e θ i 1 d i u i sin θ i υ i cos θ i p i 1 t r 2 i r i with p i 1 x i 1 y i 1 t r 1 i cos θ i ψ i sin θ i ψ i t and r 2 i sin θ i ψ i cos θ i ψ i t 3 2 high gain observer it should be noticed that the terms p i 1 in 16 and 17 are unavailable for controller implementation under assumption 1 to facilitate the controller development we need to estimate the derivative of the leader s position p i 1 however it is challenging to estimate p i 1 if p i 1 x i 1 y i 1 t is unavailable despite bounded in this work we firstly reconstruct the leader s position p i 1 based on the available information using eqs 5 and 6 we have x i 1 x i d i cos θ i ψ i y i 1 y i d i sin θ i ψ i which gives 18 x i 1 x i d i cos θ i ψ i 19 y i 1 y i d i sin θ i ψ i from eqs 18 and 19 we know that the leader s position p i 1 could be recovered by the follower s position p i and orientation ψ i and the relative information including relative distance d i and relative bearing angle θ i that are measured by the on board sensor e g binocular vision sensor mounted on the follower subsequently a high gain observer is employed to estimate the derivative of the leader s position p i 1 consider the following linear system ς i ξ 1 i ξ 2 i 20 ς i ξ 2 i λ i ξ 2 i ξ 1 i p i 1 where ξ 1 i ξ 1 1 i ξ 2 1 i t and ξ 2 i ξ 1 2 i ξ 2 2 i t are the system states the design parameter ς i is a small positive constant and the design parameter λ i is chosen such that the polynomial s 2 λ i s 1 is hurwitz from system 20 we have 21 ξ 2 i ς i p i 1 ς i ϕ i where ϕ i ξ 2 i λ i ξ 1 i then the reconstruction of the leader s velocity is summarized in the following lemma lemma 1 consider system 20 with p i 1 satisfying p i 1 p 0 i 1 p i 1 p 1 i 1 and p i 1 p 2 i 1 where p i 1 denotes the position of the leader p i 1 is the velocity vector p i 1 is the acceleration vector and p 0 i 1 p 1 i 1 p 2 i 1 are unknown positive constants the term ξ 2 i ς i in 21 can be employed to estimate p i 1 with estimate error ς i ϕ i where ϕ i satisfies ϕ i h i with h i being an unknown constant that depends only on p 0 i 1 p 1 i 1 p 2 i 1 and λ i i e the estimate error could be made arbitrary small by choosing small enough design parameters ς i proof the proof can be found in behtash 1990 remark 1 note that the variable p i 1 denotes the position of the leader the position of the leader p i 1 is the reference signal for the follower i in theorem 1 it should be noticed that our conclusion is that all the signals in the closed loop system including system states and control inputs are bounded obviously if the reference signal to be tracked is unbounded then the estimate of this signal is also unbounded even though the estimate error is stable since this estimation presents into the control laws 28 and 29 an unbounded signal p i 1 would require an infinite control input to obtain the boundedness of all the signals in the closed loop therefore we assume that p i 1 is bounded remark 2 it should be pointed out that the derivative of the leader s position p i 1 is retained in eqs 16 and 17 this is important for the follower to estimate p i 1 from p i 1 where p i 1 can be recovered by the follower s position p i and yaw angle ψ i and the relative information including relative distance d i and relative bearing angle θ i if the kinematic equations in 4 are substituted into eqs 16 and 17 e g dai et al 2020a then it is challenging to estimate the surge velocity u i 1 and sway velocity υ i 1 in the absence of communication since the leader s yaw angle ψ i 1 cannot be measured by the on board sensors mounted on the follower thus the upper bounds of the surge and sway velocities of the leader are estimated in dai et al 2020a while the derivative of the leader s position p i 1 is directly estimated in our work which is less conservative 3 3 formation control design 1 kinematic control design define the following error coordinate transformation 22 e 21 i u i α f u i 23 e 22

signals u i υ i and r i are unmeasured directly in some practical applications since the vehicle is often equipped without acceleration sensor therefore to avoid using the derivatives of virtual

error systems 16 17 36 37 39 and 40 if given any χ i 0 for all initial conditions satisfying v 3 i 0 χ i then we have v 3 i t χ i t 0 and v 3 i ρ i v 3 i δ i which imply that the closed loop error signals e α 1 i e α 2 i e 21 i e 22 i e d i and e θ i are uniformly ultimately bounded proof using inequality 48 we have 50 v 3 i t v 3 i 0 exp ρ i t ϱ i c i t 0 where ϱ i δ i ρ i and c i v 3 i 0 ϱ i from 45 and 50 it follows that 51 β d i 2 π tan π e d i 2 2 β d i 2 β θ i 2 π tan π e θ i 2 2 β θ i 2 1 2 γ i h i 2 1 2 e α 1 i 2 1 2 e α 2 i 2 1 2 e 21 i 2 1 2 e 22 i 2 c i which means that β d i 2 π tan π e d i 2 2 β d i 2 c i β θ i 2 π tan π e θ i 2 2 β θ i 2 c i then we have 52 e d i 2 2 β d i 2 π tan 1 π β d i 2 c i β d i 2 similarly we could obtain 53 e θ i 2 2 β θ i 2 π tan 1 π β θ i 2 c i β

are uniformly ultimately bounded it is worth pointing out that e θ i β θ i with β θ i given in 14 indicates that e θ i will converge to a small neighborhood of zero in a finite time by selecting appropriate boundary function parameters i e large enough κ θ i and small enough β θ i remark 3 it is worth noticing that it would be easy to show the boundedness of the system states for fully actuated usv in the presence of lemma 2 which guarantees the boundedness of all the closed loop error signals under the passive boundedness assumption the boundedness of the system states for underactuated usv can also be obtained easily using lemma 2 however these conclusions cannot be easily extended to the underactuated usv with non diagonal inertia matrix in the absence of passive boundedness assumption different from fully actuated usv there is no independent control input in the sway direction which requires additional efforts to verify the boundedness of the sway velocity in the absence of passive boundedness assumption thus we are motivated to verify the boundedness of the sway velocity in lemma 3 using eqs 22 24 and 28 we have 55 u i a 1 u i υ i tan θ i where a 1 u i e

d i with a 1 r i e 22 i e α 2 i β θ i 2 2 π e θ i 2 β θ i β θ i k θ i sin π e θ i 2 β θ i 2 β θ i e θ i β θ i u i sin θ i ξ 2 i t r 2 i ς i d i h ˆ i d i tanh e θ i q θ i h ˆ i ζ i d i where d i is bounded using 54 and 10 then a 1 r i is bounded substituting the transformation υ i υ i ε i r i given in 3 into 56 yields 57 r i a 2 r i υ i cos θ i d i ε i cos θ i where a 2 r i a 1 r i d i d i ε i cos θ i is bounded substituting equations υ i υ i ε i r i and 57 into 55 gives 58 u i a 2 u i υ i d i tan θ i d i ε i cos θ i where a 2 u i a 1 u i ε i a 2 r i tan θ i is bounded it should be noted that the boundedness of r i in 57 and u i in 58 is related to the boundedness of υ i to show the boundedness of υ i we expand system 2 to obtain the sway dynamics 59 m 33 i υ i m 12 i u i r i m 13 i u

the sway velocity dynamic system 60 with the vehicle parameters satisfying m 11 i 0 m 22 i 0 m 33 i 0 m 33 i 0 and the hydrodynamic coefficients satisfying y υ i 0 y υ i υ i 0 y r i υ i 0 y r i 0 y υ

control design with b i and c i being positive constants where a i b i and c i are given in 74 76 respectively proof see appendix based on lemmas 1 3 the main result of this paper is summarized in theorem 1 where the schematic diagram of the proposed formation control strategy is given in fig 2 theorem 1 under assumptions 1 2 consider a group of n usvs with dynamics 1 and 2 the control laws τ u

χ i then we have v 3 i t χ i t 0 and v 3 i ρ i v 3 i δ i which imply the following i all the signals in the closed loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded and ii the prescribed transient and steady state performances of formation errors e d i t and e θ i t in the sense of 13 is guaranteed which indicates that the possible controller singularity problem is avoided and the constraints on collision avoidance and connectivity maintenance between the follower and its leader are never violated i e d i c o l d i t d i c o n θ i θ i t θ i t 0 proof i the boundedness of the closed loop errors h i e α 1 i e α 2 i e 21 i e 22 i e d i and e θ i has been shown in lemma 2 using eqs 10 and 11 we know that d i and θ i are bounded then the boundedness of the system state η i is guaranteed by eqs 5 and 6 and assumption 1 using lemma 3 we know that υ i is bounded which ensures the boundedness of u i and r i using eqs 58 and 57 then υ i in 3 is bounded due to the boundedness of υ i and r i subsequently the virtual control signals α u i and α r i given in 28 and 29 are bounded note that the boundedness of w ˆ l i and s l i z l i l 1 2 has been shown in 44 and 41 respectively subsequently the control signals τ u i in 42 and τ r i in 43 are also uniformly ultimately bounded therefore all the signals in the closed loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded ii from inequality 54 we have e d i β d i and e θ i β θ i which indicates that the prescribed transient and steady state performances of formation errors given in 13 is guaranteed using inequality 54 and eq 14 we achieve that inequality 12 is satisfied then we have d i c o l d i t d i c o n and θ i θ i t θ i t 0 which means that the connectivity preserving as well as the collision avoidance constraints between the follower and its leader are satisfied while the possible controller singularity problem is also avoided by inequality 9 4 simulation studies to illustrate the performance of the proposed

be achieved by selecting large design parameters k d i k θ i k u i k r i λ i and small design parameters μ u i and μ r i nevertheless it is not suggested to select very large design parameters in

non diagonal inertia matrix and limited sensing capabilities to facilitate the controller development the high gain observer was employed to reconstruct the velocity of the leader using solely the available los range and bearing angle that are measured by the on board sensors of the follower based on nonlinear coordinate transformation tan type barrier lyapunov functions backstepping procedure dsc technique nn approximation and control lyapunov synthesis a leader follower formation control algorithm was developed to guarantee the satisfaction of collision avoidance and connectivity preserving constraints and to avoid the possible controller singularity problem simultaneously in addition the predefined performance indices of the formation tracking errors could also be guaranteed by the proposed formation control strategy despite the presence of modeling uncertainties the proposed formation control strategy is decentralized in the sense that the control signals for every usv are calculated based only on the relative information about its leader consisting of the los range and relative bearing angle the input saturation often severely limits system performance giving rise to undesirable inaccuracy or leading instability design of formation control for uncertain underactuated usvs subject to input saturation has been widely recognized to be practically imperative but challenging this problem will be more challenging when the on board sensors are subject to limited sensing capabilities opportunities for future work include formation control for multiple uncertain underactuated usvs with unknown non diagonal inertia matrix and input saturation under limited sensing capabilities and asymmetric formation error constraint meanwhile we will carry out practical

to a small neighborhood of zero in a finite time as shown in lemma 2 thus a i reduces to a i m 23 i n υ i υ i n υ i r i cos θ i d i ε i cos θ i m 33 i y υ i υ i y υ i r i cos θ i d i ε i cos θ i after the transient stage it should be pointed out that the nonlinear hydrodynamic damping matrix d ν i is usually modeled by taylor series expansion do and pan 2009 which implies that the hydrodynamic damping coefficients satisfy n υ i υ i n υ i r i and y υ i υ i y υ i r i since n υ i υ i and y υ i υ i in sway direction are dominant coefficients comparing with n υ i r i and y υ i r i respectively therefore there exists a negative constant a i such that a i a i 0 using lemma 2 we can achieve that b i and c i are bounded i e b i b i and c i c i with b i and c i being positive constants then inequality 73 can be further rewritten as 77 v υ i υ i a i υ i 2 b i υ i c i it is easy to verify that b i 2 4 a i c i 0 which implies that the inequality a i υ i 2 b i υ i c i 0 holds as long as υ i b i b i 2 4 a i c i 2 a i using inequality 77 we can reach that v υ i 0 when υ i b i b i 2 4 a i c i 2 a i which means that the inequality υ i b i b i 2 4 a i c i 2 a i holds as t tends to infinity therefore we could conclude that the sway velocity of the i th vehicle υ i is ultimately bounded 
20923,the aim of this paper is to address the leader follower formation control problem for a group of underactuated unmanned surface vehicles usvs with non diagonal inertia matrix subject to modeling uncertainties and limited sensing capabilities no communication is required among the usvs but every usv is only equipped with on board sensors to measure the line of sight los range and the relative bearing angle the connectivity preserving constraint arisen from the limited sensing capability and the collision avoidance constraint resulting from the safety requirement are imposed on the los range and the relative bearing angle between every follower and its leader these constraints are subsequently incorporated into the tan type barrier lyapunov function based formation control design every usv reconstructs the velocity of its leader using the high gain observer based solely on the available los range and relative bearing angle based on coordinate transformation backstepping procedure dynamic surface control dsc technique and neural network approximation a singularity free formation controller is then developed which guarantees the boundedness of all the closed loop system signals and achieves satisfaction of prescribed performance specifications on the formation errors simulations are performed to verify the effectiveness of the formation control strategy keywords underactuated usvs formation control collision and connectivity constraints prescribed performance 1 introduction the most recent years have witnessed the increasing deployment of multiple unmanned vehicles instead of a single vehicle to perform various maritime tasks such as environmental monitoring search and rescue and ocean resource exploration fahimi 2007 cui et al 2010 liu et al 2016 peng et al 2021 limited energy and coverage of the unmanned vehicle make it challenging to accomplish these tasks within reasonable time and cost using a single vehicle gao and guo 2019 the robustness against the system faults is another weakness comparing with multi vehicle system jin 2016 consequently cooperation of a group of vehicles is more desirable when executing these missions where the coordinated operation of the vehicle group is an important part of the cooperation in general the coordinated operation could be divided into guidance navigation and control of the vehicle group liu et al 2016 thus cooperative control of multiple unmanned surface vehicles usvs is practically motivated in which cooperative formation control of multi vehicle system has attracted considerable attention in control and marine engineering communities during the past two decades arrichiello et al 2006 dong and farrell 2008 sun et al 2018 ghommam and saad 2018 xie et al 2018 lu et al 2018 he et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 lu et al 2020 in practical applications most of the usvs equipped without independent sway actuator belong to a class of underactuated systems which means that the usvs have three degrees of freedom to be controlled but have only two independent control inputs do and pan 2009 dai et al 2019 under this typical configuration designing formation control laws for each individual vehicle to achieve the desired formation shape and simultaneously stabilize the sway dynamics is challenging and important in jin 2016 a formation control strategy for a group of underactuated surface vessels is proposed by controlling the line of sight los range and angle between the follower and its leader to deal with the underactuation where the passive boundedness assumption proposed in li et al 2008 is employed to ensure the boundedness of the sway velocity based on the transverse function approach morin and samson 2003 a dynamic oscillator also called as additional control input is introduced to stabilize the sway dynamics do 2012 where the potential functions are incorporated into the formation control design to guarantee no collisions among the underactuated ships the authors in gu et al 2019 employ the auxiliary variable approach to overcome the difficulty caused by underactuation so as to achieve the containment maneuvering of a group of underactuated surface vehicles to achieve a desired formation shape the usvs are typically equipped with onboard sensors to interact with their neighboring vehicles while the sensing capability of the onboard sensors is often limited for example a fixed stereo camera is generally subject to the field of view constraint and the on board wireless communication device e g wi fi is often subject to limited communication range kan et al 2019 dai et al 2020b under the physical limitation of the onboard sensors it is important to guarantee the connectivity among the vehicles since any connectivity break would lead to failure of establishment of the formation at the initial stage and destruction of the formation during the motion when preserving the connectivity among the vehicles avoiding the collisions among the vehicles is also significant because the collision would cause damage of the vehicles resulting in economic loss and failure of the task abdelaal et al 2018 as a result the connectivity preserving constraint arisen from the limited sensing capability of the onboard sensors and the collision avoidance constraint resulting from the safety requirement are of practically interest during the formation control design a fuzzy logic based collision avoidance algorithm is proposed in hinostroza et al 2019 to achieve cooperative operation of multiple fully actuated usvs in leader follower formation structure in liang et al 2020 the repulsive potential function is employed to avoid the collision among the usvs and the virtual swarm center is designed to keep all usvs connected in the group but the stability of the sway dynamics is neglected a distributed path guided formation control strategy is proposed in peng et al 2019 where the artificial potential functions are applied to avoid the collisions among the vehicles and preserve the initial network connectivity incorporating the path generation and potential functions into the model predictive control the collision avoidance and connectivity maintenance among the autonomous underactuated surface vehicles are guaranteed in tran et al 2020 although the previous works hinostroza et al 2019 liang et al 2020 peng et al 2019 tran et al 2020 provide efficient methods to address the problems of collision avoidance and connectivity preservation they could not achieve pre determined formation control performance indices regarding convergence rate maximum overshoot and steady residual set for the formation errors guaranteeing these performance indices is desirable in many practical applications since slow convergence rate and large maximum overshoot of the formation errors may result in increasing time of formation setup while a large steady state error would lead to imperfect formation and reduced accurate accomplishment of the task based on the above observation in this work we aim to address the formation control problem for a group of uncertain underactuated usvs with non diagonal inertia matrix subject to limited sensing capabilities under connectivity preservation and collision avoidance constraints each usv in the group is equipped with on board sensors to measure the los range and relative bearing angle this typical configuration can release the communication requirement thus the high gain observer is developed for every follower to reconstruct the velocity of its leader using only the available los range and relative bearing angle a coordinate transformation is introduced to overcome the difficulties caused by off diagonal system matrix the tan type barrier lyapunov functions are employed to guarantee the satisfaction of the connectivity preservation and collision avoidance constraints the modeling uncertainties are estimated by the neural networks nns and the dynamic surface control dsc technique is applied to avoid using the derivatives of virtual controls in the actual controllers comparing with jin 2016 the passive boundedness assumption is removed the inertia matrix of the vehicle is non diagonal and the predefined formation control performances are addressed explicitly in our work different from do 2012 gu et al 2019 hinostroza et al 2019 liang et al 2020 peng et al 2019 and tran et al 2020 our proposed formation control protocol requires no information exchange among the vehicles especially the imprecise velocity which is often derived from the position obtained by the global position system gps meanwhile our proposed formation control strategy can guarantee the prescribed transient and steady state performances of the formation errors which is the major difference between our work and do 2012 gu et al 2019 hinostroza et al 2019 liang et al 2020 peng et al 2019 and tran et al 2020 the technical contributions of our work are summarized as follows 1 the connectivity preservation and collision avoidance between every usv and its leader are achieved and the possible controller singularity problem is also avoided 2 by incorporating the tan type barrier functions the prescribed transient and steady state performances of the formation tracking errors are guaranteed despite the presence of modeling uncertainties 3 the feedback information about the leader is only the los range and relative bearing angle that are measured by the on board sensors of the follower based on the available los range and bearing angle the follower reconstructs the velocity of its leader by the high gain observer such that the communication is no longer required 2 problem formulation 2 1 usv dynamics consider a group of n underactuated usvs moving in a horizontal plane with index set n 1 n the kinematics of the i th usv is given by x i u i cos ψ i υ i sin ψ i 1 y i u i sin ψ i υ i cos ψ i ψ i r i with i n where η i x i y i ψ i t is the system output coordinated in the earth fixed frame o e x e y e with x i y i being the position and ψ i being the yaw angle and ν i u i υ i r i t coordinated in the body fixed frame o b x b y b denotes the vehicle velocity with u i υ i and r i being the corresponding velocities in surge sway and yaw respectively the kinetics of the i th vehicle dynamics is given by fossen 2002 2 m

vehicle center of gravity x u i y υ i y r i n r i are the added masses and x y n are the hydrodynamic damping coefficients 2 2 coordinate transformation of vehicle dynamics considering the off diagonal inertia matrix m i of the underactuated usv with system dynamics 2 the yaw moment control τ r i will act on the sway dynamics by directly expanding 2 as a result this direct interaction brings difficulty in designing the yaw moment control law to stabilize both sway and yaw dynamics simultaneously the following coordinate transformations are introduced to overcome this difficulty x i x i ε i cos ψ i 3 y i y i ε i sin ψ i υ i υ i ε i r i where ε i m 23 i m 22 i is a small constant since the off diagonal term m 23 i is small compared to the diagonal term m 22 i using coordinate

consider a leader follower formation consisting of n following vehicles and a virtual leader vehicle where the virtual leader moves along a predefined trajectory let η 0 x 0 y 0 ψ 0 t be the trajectory of the virtual leader with x 0 y 0 being the position and ψ 0 being the yaw angle in the leader follower formation there are many pairs of leaders and followers and each follower has a fixed leader the control objective is to design a formation control protocol for every follower such that the follower maintains a desired separation with its leader in the presence of limited sensing capability of the on board sensors the prescribed formation shape can be achieved if each follower in the group maintains the desired separation with its leader as such we can only just consider a pair of leader and follower and the leader is labeled as i 1 while the follower is labeled as i the basic leader follower formation architecture about a pair of leader and follower vehicles is shown in fig 1 the los range d i t and bearing angle θ i t between the follower and its leader as shown in fig 1 is defined as 5 d i t x i 1 x i 2 y i 1 y i 2 6 θ i t atan2 y i x i with x i y i cos ψ i sin ψ i sin ψ i cos ψ i x i 1 x i y i 1 y i where function atan2 y x returns the four quadrant inverse tangent of y and x see dai et al 2018 it should be noticed that the relative distance d i and relative bearing angle θ i are measured by the on board sensor of the i th usv due to the limited sensory capabilities of the on board sensor e g a fixed camera the relative bearing angle θ i should be restricted within the feasible region θ i θ i such that the leader is detectable for the follower where θ i and θ i denote the minimal and maximal detectable relative bearing angle for the follower respectively additionally the sensing range of the on board sensor is often limited to maintain the desired separation we consider the following relative distance and bearing angle constraints namely collision avoidance and connectivity maintenance constraints 7 d i c o l d i t d i c o n 8 θ i θ i t θ i where d i c o l denotes the safety distance and d i c o n d i c o n d i c o l 0 denotes the maximal sensing distance of the on board sensor mounted on the i th usv note that the control law given in 28 would be singular if θ i π 2 however this problem could be avoided by i guaranteeing the satisfaction of the constraint 8 through control design and ii appropriately designing the parameters θ i and θ i in 8 thus we provide a guideline for parameter selection i e 9 θ i π 2 θ i π 2 to guarantee non violation of constraints 7 and 8 the desired distance d i d e s and the desired bearing angle θ i d e s are introduced 10 e d i t d i t d i d e s 11 e θ i t θ i t θ i d e s where d i d e s d i c o l d i c o n 2 and θ i d e s θ i θ i 2 substituting 10 and 11 into 7 and 8 yields d i c o l d i d e s e d i t d i c o n d i d e s 12 θ i θ i d e s e θ i t θ i θ i d e s to provide transient performance specifications on the overall formation errors we further enforce prescribed performance constraints on the transient response of distance error e d i t and bearing angle error e θ i t in the formation control design that is the following time varying constraints are employed 13 β d i t e d i t β d i t β θ i t e θ i t β θ i t where β d i t and β d i t are the prescribed lower and upper bounds of error e d i t while β θ i t and β θ i t are the prescribed lower and upper bounds of error e θ i t the boundary functions β d i t and β θ i t are taken as β d i t β d i 0 β d i exp κ d i t β d i 14 β θ i t β θ i 0 β θ i exp κ θ i t β θ i with β d i 0 d i c o n d i d e s and β θ i 0 θ i θ i d e s where β e d i β θ i denote the allowable maximal values of the steady state formation errors and κ d i and κ θ i are designer specified positive constants note that eq 14 is also called as performance functions bechlioulis and rovithakis 2008 it is clear that if the constraint 13 with 14 is guaranteed by the controller then the constraint 12 is satisfied which indicates that the inequalities 7 and 8 hold assumption 1 the desired trajectory η 0 and its bounded derivative η 0 are provided to the leading vehicle 1 only the follower has no access to the leader s information and only the relative distance d i t and relative bearing angle θ i t between the follower i and its leader i 1 can be measured by the follower s onboard sensors assumption 2 at the initial time t 0 each usv is positioned at a given location that does not violate the collision and connectivity constraints i e it satisfies the conditions d i c o l d i 0 d i c o n and θ i θ i 0 θ i i n formation control objective under assumptions 1 2 the control objective is to design control law τ i for each vehicle i i n such that i each vehicle i tracks its leader vehicle i 1 with non violation of collision as well as connectivity constraints given in 7 and 8 during movement while avoiding the possible controller singularity problem and ii the prescribed transient and steady state performances of the formation errors e d i t and e θ i t in the sense of 13 and 14 is guaranteed 3 observer based formation control design under the constraint condition 13 in this section we present a constructive design technique of adaptive nn formation control that forces the follower to track its leader with desired separation to facilitate the discussion about the constraint condition 13 we introduce a tan type barrier lyapunov function 3 1 tan type barrier lyapunov functions we introduce a time varying tan type barrier lyapunov function as follows jin 2016 15 v z β z 2 π tan π z 2 2 β z 2 where z is the error that should satisfy the inequality β z t z β z t it follows from 15 that v z grows to infinity when the error z approaches the prescribed error bounds β z t and β z t therefore guaranteeing the boundedness of v z could guarantee non violation of the constraint β z t z β z t it is interesting to notice that when the error bound β z tends to infinity we could by l hospital s rule obtain lim β z β z 2 π tan π z 2 2 β z 2 1 2 z 2 which indicates that the tan type barrier lyapunov function 15 is a general approach that would also work in the situation where there is no constraint requirement considering eqs 5 and 6 and differentiating equations 10 and 11 obtain 16 e d i u i cos θ i υ i sin θ i p i 1 t r 1 i 17 e θ i 1 d i u i sin θ i υ i cos θ i p i 1 t r 2 i r i with p i 1 x i 1 y i 1 t r 1 i cos θ i ψ i sin θ i ψ i t and r 2 i sin θ i ψ i cos θ i ψ i t 3 2 high gain observer it should be noticed that the terms p i 1 in 16 and 17 are unavailable for controller implementation under assumption 1 to facilitate the controller development we need to estimate the derivative of the leader s position p i 1 however it is challenging to estimate p i 1 if p i 1 x i 1 y i 1 t is unavailable despite bounded in this work we firstly reconstruct the leader s position p i 1 based on the available information using eqs 5 and 6 we have x i 1 x i d i cos θ i ψ i y i 1 y i d i sin θ i ψ i which gives 18 x i 1 x i d i cos θ i ψ i 19 y i 1 y i d i sin θ i ψ i from eqs 18 and 19 we know that the leader s position p i 1 could be recovered by the follower s position p i and orientation ψ i and the relative information including relative distance d i and relative bearing angle θ i that are measured by the on board sensor e g binocular vision sensor mounted on the follower subsequently a high gain observer is employed to estimate the derivative of the leader s position p i 1 consider the following linear system ς i ξ 1 i ξ 2 i 20 ς i ξ 2 i λ i ξ 2 i ξ 1 i p i 1 where ξ 1 i ξ 1 1 i ξ 2 1 i t and ξ 2 i ξ 1 2 i ξ 2 2 i t are the system states the design parameter ς i is a small positive constant and the design parameter λ i is chosen such that the polynomial s 2 λ i s 1 is hurwitz from system 20 we have 21 ξ 2 i ς i p i 1 ς i ϕ i where ϕ i ξ 2 i λ i ξ 1 i then the reconstruction of the leader s velocity is summarized in the following lemma lemma 1 consider system 20 with p i 1 satisfying p i 1 p 0 i 1 p i 1 p 1 i 1 and p i 1 p 2 i 1 where p i 1 denotes the position of the leader p i 1 is the velocity vector p i 1 is the acceleration vector and p 0 i 1 p 1 i 1 p 2 i 1 are unknown positive constants the term ξ 2 i ς i in 21 can be employed to estimate p i 1 with estimate error ς i ϕ i where ϕ i satisfies ϕ i h i with h i being an unknown constant that depends only on p 0 i 1 p 1 i 1 p 2 i 1 and λ i i e the estimate error could be made arbitrary small by choosing small enough design parameters ς i proof the proof can be found in behtash 1990 remark 1 note that the variable p i 1 denotes the position of the leader the position of the leader p i 1 is the reference signal for the follower i in theorem 1 it should be noticed that our conclusion is that all the signals in the closed loop system including system states and control inputs are bounded obviously if the reference signal to be tracked is unbounded then the estimate of this signal is also unbounded even though the estimate error is stable since this estimation presents into the control laws 28 and 29 an unbounded signal p i 1 would require an infinite control input to obtain the boundedness of all the signals in the closed loop therefore we assume that p i 1 is bounded remark 2 it should be pointed out that the derivative of the leader s position p i 1 is retained in eqs 16 and 17 this is important for the follower to estimate p i 1 from p i 1 where p i 1 can be recovered by the follower s position p i and yaw angle ψ i and the relative information including relative distance d i and relative bearing angle θ i if the kinematic equations in 4 are substituted into eqs 16 and 17 e g dai et al 2020a then it is challenging to estimate the surge velocity u i 1 and sway velocity υ i 1 in the absence of communication since the leader s yaw angle ψ i 1 cannot be measured by the on board sensors mounted on the follower thus the upper bounds of the surge and sway velocities of the leader are estimated in dai et al 2020a while the derivative of the leader s position p i 1 is directly estimated in our work which is less conservative 3 3 formation control design 1 kinematic control design define the following error coordinate transformation 22 e 21 i u i α f u i 23 e 22

are uniformly ultimately bounded it is worth pointing out that e θ i β θ i with β θ i given in 14 indicates that e θ i will converge to a small neighborhood of zero in a finite time by selecting appropriate boundary function parameters i e large enough κ θ i and small enough β θ i remark 3 it is worth noticing that it would be easy to show the boundedness of the system states for fully actuated usv in the presence of lemma 2 which guarantees the boundedness of all the closed loop error signals under the passive boundedness assumption the boundedness of the system states for underactuated usv can also be obtained easily using lemma 2 however these conclusions cannot be easily extended to the underactuated usv with non diagonal inertia matrix in the absence of passive boundedness assumption different from fully actuated usv there is no independent control input in the sway direction which requires additional efforts to verify the boundedness of the sway velocity in the absence of passive boundedness assumption thus we are motivated to verify the boundedness of the sway velocity in lemma 3 using eqs 22 24 and 28 we have 55 u i a 1 u i υ i tan θ i where a 1 u i e

bounded using 54 and 10 then a 1 r i is bounded substituting the transformation υ i υ i ε i r i given in 3 into 56 yields 57 r i a 2 r i υ i cos θ i d i ε i cos θ i where a 2 r i a 1 r i d i d i ε i cos θ i is bounded substituting equations υ i υ i ε i r i and 57 into 55 gives 58 u i a 2 u i υ i d i tan θ i d i ε i cos θ i where a 2 u i a 1 u i ε i a 2 r i tan θ i is bounded it should be noted that the boundedness of r i in 57 and u i in 58 is related to the boundedness of υ i to show the boundedness of υ i we expand system 2 to obtain the sway dynamics 59 m 33 i υ i m 12 i u i r i m 13 i u

the sway velocity dynamic system 60 with the vehicle parameters satisfying m 11 i 0 m 22 i 0 m 33 i 0 m 33 i 0 and the hydrodynamic coefficients satisfying y υ i 0 y υ i υ i 0 y r i υ i 0 y r i 0 y υ

control design with b i and c i being positive constants where a i b i and c i are given in 74 76 respectively proof see appendix based on lemmas 1 3 the main result of this paper is summarized in theorem 1 where the schematic diagram of the proposed formation control strategy is given in fig 2 theorem 1 under assumptions 1 2 consider a group of n usvs with dynamics 1 and 2 the control laws τ u

χ i then we have v 3 i t χ i t 0 and v 3 i ρ i v 3 i δ i which imply the following i all the signals in the closed loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded and ii the prescribed transient and steady state performances of formation errors e d i t and e θ i t in the sense of 13 is guaranteed which indicates that the possible controller singularity problem is avoided and the constraints on collision avoidance and connectivity maintenance between the follower and its leader are never violated i e d i c o l d i t d i c o n θ i θ i t θ i t 0 proof i the boundedness of the closed loop errors h i e α 1 i e α 2 i e 21 i e 22 i e d i and e θ i has been shown in lemma 2 using eqs 10 and 11 we know that d i and θ i are bounded then the boundedness of the system state η i is guaranteed by eqs 5 and 6 and assumption 1 using lemma 3 we know that υ i is bounded which ensures the boundedness of u i and r i using eqs 58 and 57 then υ i in 3 is bounded due to the boundedness of υ i and r i subsequently the virtual control signals α u i and α r i given in 28 and 29 are bounded note that the boundedness of w ˆ l i and s l i z l i l 1 2 has been shown in 44 and 41 respectively subsequently the control signals τ u i in 42 and τ r i in 43 are also uniformly ultimately bounded therefore all the signals in the closed loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded ii from inequality 54 we have e d i β d i and e θ i β θ i which indicates that the prescribed transient and steady state performances of formation errors given in 13 is guaranteed using inequality 54 and eq 14 we achieve that inequality 12 is satisfied then we have d i c o l d i t d i c o n and θ i θ i t θ i t 0 which means that the connectivity preserving as well as the collision avoidance constraints between the follower and its leader are satisfied while the possible controller singularity problem is also avoided by inequality 9 4 simulation studies to illustrate the performance of the proposed

be achieved by selecting large design parameters k d i k θ i k u i k r i λ i and small design parameters μ u i and μ r i nevertheless it is not suggested to select very large design parameters in practical applications since large design parameters may lead to a high gain controller that requires powerful actuators therefore the design parameters should be chosen appropriately for obtaining

non diagonal inertia matrix and limited sensing capabilities to facilitate the controller development the high gain observer was employed to reconstruct the velocity of the leader using solely the available los range and bearing angle that are measured by the on board sensors of the follower based on nonlinear coordinate transformation tan type barrier lyapunov functions backstepping procedure dsc technique nn approximation and control lyapunov synthesis a leader follower formation control algorithm was developed to guarantee the satisfaction of collision avoidance and connectivity preserving constraints and to avoid the possible controller singularity problem simultaneously in addition the predefined performance indices of the formation tracking errors could also be guaranteed by the proposed formation control strategy despite the presence of modeling uncertainties the proposed formation control strategy is decentralized in the sense that the control signals for every usv are calculated based only on the relative information about its leader consisting of the los range and relative bearing angle the input saturation often severely limits system performance giving rise to undesirable inaccuracy or leading instability design of formation control for uncertain underactuated usvs subject to input saturation has been widely recognized to be practically imperative but challenging this problem will be more challenging when the on board sensors are subject to limited sensing capabilities opportunities for future work include formation control for multiple uncertain underactuated usvs with unknown non diagonal inertia matrix and input saturation under limited sensing capabilities and asymmetric formation error constraint meanwhile we will carry out practical

the transient stage it should be pointed out that the nonlinear hydrodynamic damping matrix d ν i is usually modeled by taylor series expansion do and pan 2009 which implies that the hydrodynamic damping coefficients satisfy n υ i υ i n υ i r i and y υ i υ i y υ i r i since n υ i υ i and y υ i υ i in sway direction are dominant coefficients comparing with n υ i r i and y υ i r i respectively therefore there exists a negative constant a i such that a i a i 0 using lemma 2 we can achieve that b i and c i are bounded i e b i b i and c i c i with b i and c i being positive constants then inequality 73 can be further rewritten as 77 v υ i υ i a i υ i 2 b i υ i c i it is easy to verify that b i 2 4 a i c i 0 which implies that the inequality a i υ i 2 b i υ i c i 0 holds as long as υ i b i b i 2 4 a i c i 2 a i using inequality 77 we can reach that v υ i 0 when υ i b i b i 2 4 a i c i 2 a i which means that the inequality υ i b i b i 2 4 a i c i 2 a i holds as t tends to infinity therefore we could conclude that the sway velocity of the i th vehicle υ i is ultimately bounded

cable the fdm cable model developed by ablow and schechter 1983 and howell et al 1992 is worthy to note but it still has some limitations such as the ignoring of the cable s rotary inertia terms the singularity of euler angles and the singularity for a slacking cable achievements have been made to address these mentioned limitations for example chatjigeorgiou 2010a 2010b 2013 develops a novel model considering the rotary inertia terms of the cable and they use it to investigate the dynamics of a drilling rotating cable and the dynamics of a pipe with internal fluids running along its length hover 1997 tjavaras et al 1998 develop a model that the euler parameters are replacing the euler angles to describe the cable s attitude motion and they use it to predict the dynamic response of the highly extensible breaking line to overcome the singularity due to tether slack howell et al 1992 shabana and yakoub 2000 develop a model including bending stiffness of the cable secondly the lpm cable model is widely used due to its mathematical simplicity and easy understanding and implementation huang 1994 williams et al 2006 yang et al 2013 a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations can be directly derived from the second law of newton the notable lpm cable model is developed by huang 1994 williams et al 2006 williams and trivailo 2007 and buckham et al 2003 the bending stiffness of the cable is included to address the singularity problem due to the slack of tether buckham et al 2003 2004 thirdly the fem is categorized into two approaches the conventional finite element formulation cfef and the absolute nodal coordinate formulation ancf for the cfef the displacement is used as the state variable and its current position is updated by adding the current displacement up to its previous position buckham et al 2004 and quan et al 2015 2016 adopt the cfef to investigate the dynamic behavior of a low tension tether for the deep sea remotely operated vehicle system for the ancf the position and its gradient are used as state variables sun et al 2011 li and zhu 2019 kim et al 2012 park and kim 2015 deng et al 2018 kawaguti et al 2007 takehara et al 2011 li et al 2015 and zhu 2010 adopt the ancf method to predict the dynamic response of the tcbs finally for the fsm the cable is divided into a series of small segments or rods which experiences a large longitudinal and lateral deformation huston and kamman 1982 kamman and huston 1985 it has been successfully employed to predict the dynamic response of a submerged cable system kamman and huston 1985 2001 the mooring line system chen et al 2001 and the riser system xu et al 2013 xu and zou 2015 for these four mentioned modeling methods each method has each own merits and limitations more detailed information related to the modeling methods of the cable can be found in refs chatjigeorgiou 2008 jain 1994 li and zhu 2019 patel and seyed 1995 in the current paper the fdm is adopted to model the tcbs due to its easy implementation and validation purpose with existing references another critical aspect of the modeling of tcbs is the time integration method in the past decades many studies are devoted to this field gobat et al 2002 koh and rong 2004 li et al 2015 li and zhu 2015 tian et al 2009 zhang and zhang 2016 initially the keller box scheme with second order accuracy is proposed to solve the cable dynamics chatjigeorgiou 2010a 2010b huo et al 2011 park et al 2003 wang et al 2012 wang and sun 2015 however a nonphysical high frequency oscillation is generated furthermore this method has poor numerical stability and is susceptible to crank nicholson noise gobat et al 2002 koh et al 1999 wang et al 2012 later a modified box scheme is proposed to address these defects however this method only has a first order accuracy koh et al 1999 to overcome the accuracy order reduction the generalized alpha method with controllable numerical numbering has been proposed chung and hulbert 1993 gobat and grosenbaugh 2001 gobat et al 2002 it is a second order accuracy approach in both space and time domains it has been widely for the dynamic simulation of the cable tether duo to its easy set the numerical damping through these three parameters α m α k and γ quan et al 2015 tian et al 2009 therefore in the current paper the generalized alpha algorithm is adopted as the time integration method for the tcbs in the current paper the models of the cable and towed body are assembled as the standard procedure in the finite element method firstly the sensitivity analysis of the different time integration methods and the number of elements impacting the dynamic response of the tcbs is conducted then the numerical simulations are conducted in different cable configurations and different tow cases including the straight and turning tows the numerical simulations are compared to sea trial data the results show that the numerical simulation agrees satisfactorily with the sea trial data and the proposed method can be applied to study the dynamic behavior of the tcbs 2 mathematical formulation of towed cable body system 2 1 coordinate systems as shown in fig 1 the motion of the tcbs is described by three orthogonal coordinate systems a global inertial coordinate system oxyz a towed body fixed coordinate system o x y z and a local lagrangian coordinate system otnb the origin o of the global inertial coordinate system is locating at the still water level where the positive x axis points to the straightforward direction the positive z axis points to the vertical downwards and the y axis completes a right hand coordinate system the body fixed coordinate system is a moving frame which is attached to the towed body the origin o of the towed body fixed coordinate system is at center of mass cm of the towed body with x axis being the longitudinal axis directed from aft to fore and z axis pointing to the vertical downwards direction and the y axis completes a right hand coordinate system the transformation matrix t b 2 g from the towed body fixed coordinate system to the global inertial coordinate system is 1

time and length respectively ω ω t ω n ω b t and ω ω t ω n ω b t are the darboux vector of rotation velocity and local curvature respectively in the current paper the angular rotation along the t axis of the local coordinate frame is set as zero duo to the absent of end moments in torsion howell et al 1992 this removes the rotation angle along the t axis out of the state variable 4 ω ω t ω n ω b t α s β β α c β t 5 ω ω t ω n ω b t α s β β α c β t where c and s denote the cos and sin function for the local curvature ω there are only two independent variables ω n and ω b ω t ω b s β c β is removed from the state variable 2 2 2 balance of moments another set of equations can be derived from the balance of moments for the left hand side of this incremental segment chatjigeorgiou 2008 2010b chatjigeorgiou 2010b howell et al 1992 such that 6 m l ω m l 1 ε 3 t f l 0 where t is a unit vector along the tangent direction in the local lagrangian coordinate system 2 2 3 compatibility relationship based on the free of continuity of the stretched segment the cable position r s t is a continuous function of two independent variables the lagrangian coordinate s and time t moreover the partial derivatives r and r are continuous in s and t 7 d d t r d d s r substituting r v l and r 1 ε t into eq 7 yields 8 ε t 1 ε ω t v l ω v l 2 2 4 final governing equations the eom of the infinitesimal segment ds are obtained by combination of eqs 3 8 with t e a ε and they are written in vectoral form chatjigeorgiou 2008 koh and rong 2004 park et al 2003 9 m c y c k c y c n c 0 where y

towed body as presented in refs chatjigeorgiou 2008 tjavaras et al 1998 yuan et al 2014 the cable is supposed to be connected by the pinned joints at the ends of the cable for the towing ship end of the cable we are assuming the mass of the towing ship is much larger than the total mass of the cable and towed body grosenbaugh 2007 wang and sun 2015 thus it leads that the towing ship influences the cable and the cable s effect on the towing ship is ignored thus the first node of the cable shares the velocity of towing ship and it is written as 20 u 0 t v 0 t w 0 t t l 2 g t v s g where t l 2

eq 21 can be found in appendix c 2 5 discretization of the towed cable body system as presented in last section the towing ship is imposed as prescribed boundary condition as listed in eq 20 thus the eoms of the tcbs are obtained by combing eq 9 and eq 17 with consideration of the coupling effect as listed in eq 16 and eq 21 in current paper the central differencing scheme is taken as the spatial scheme for the cable and the generalized alpha method gobat and grosenbaugh 2001 is taken as the temporal discretization scheme for the cable and towed body 2 5 1 spatial discretization of the towed cable the eom of the towed cable listed in eq 9 is a partial differential equation that needs to be discretized in space firstly supposing the cable with a constant length l c is divided into n elements with n 1 nodes taking the j th element as an example j 1 n eq 9 is discretized in space using the central differencing scheme then a set of semi discretized equations are obtained as 22 m c j

tridiagonal form the effect of the towing ship is applied as the prescribed boundary condition as listed eq 20 the coupling terms between the cable and towed body are generated by the eqs 16 and 21 2 7 position coordinate evaluation of the towed cable the state variables of the cable y c u v w ω n ω b α β ε s n s b t does not explicitly contain the position coordinate x y z t however the position

discussion in the current paper the two parameters controlling the accuracy of the newton raphson iteration scheme the residual criterion and the maximum iteration number are set as to 10 8 and 50 respectively the physical parameters of the tcbs are listed in tables 1 3 where the cable contains two types the fairing and bare types the hydrodynamic force coefficients of the towed body are obtained based on the scale model experiment from ref li et al 2015 sun et al 2011 3 1 validation of the proposed method in the section three cases are carried out to validate the proposed method by comparing the nodal position finite element method npfem sun et al 2011 the steady state straight tow at different speeds 5 10 and 15 knots is studied the range of the speed covers most operation range of the towed system sun et al 2011 as shown in fig 3 the towing ship initially starts from a rest situation at a specific constant acceleration to the target speed it then keeps that speed until the steady state configuration is achieved for the comparison purpose the main physical parameters of the towed body and cable are temporary kept the same as the values in ref sun et al 2011 additional parameters of the cable corresponding to its bending motion are listed in tables 1 2 it is because the rod element model is used in the npfem in this section the 460 m length cable is combined by a 325 m bare cable and a 125 m fairing cable the mesh scheme is the same as presented in sun et al 2011 where the 250 m bare cable is uniformly divided into nine elements and the 125 m fairing cable is uniformly divided into three elements the time step size is 0 001 s the results are shown in figs 4 and 5 fig 4 shows the comparison results of steady state cable configuration at these three towing speeds it demonstrates that the match between the present model and the npfem is good however a slight difference can still be observed due to the elemental model s difference where both the axial elongation and bending motions are considered in the present method the npfem only considers the axial elongation motion of the cable fig 5 shows the cable s geometrical configuration time variation when the tcbs is towed from a vertical rest situation to a steady state situation 3 2 sensitivity analysis of the towed cable body system in this section the sensitivity analysis of different time integration methods and the number of elements is conducted in this section the cable is a 150 m fairing cable and its parameters are listed in table 1 the towing ship moves along the positive x axis direction and the velocity profile of the towing ship is shown in fig 6 where the initial velocity of the towing ship is 1 03 m s 2 knots the towing ship accelerates linearly from 1 03 m s to 3 08 m s 6 knots in the 50 s and maintains that speed for 50 s then decelerates linearly from 3 08 m s to 1 03 m s in the last 50s to obtain the steady state of the tcbs at 1 03 m s towing speed an additional dynamic simulation for the tcbs is conducted by bringing the system from a rest situation to the target speed 1 03 m s then the steady solution of this simulation is fed as the initial condition buckham et al 2004 see in fig 6 b the gray line with square symbol furthermore to evaluate the performance of each case in the sensitivity study a new ratio r t i t n is defined where t i i a g is the tension of the cable for each case here the tension of the element connected to the towed body is taken t n is a normalized value that will be given later first as listed in table 4 three cases are conducted to investigate the time integration methods impacting the dynamic response of the system for these three cases a b and c the cable is equally divided into 25 elements and the time step size is set as 0 001s here three different time integration methods are adopted the keller box method the trapezoidal method and the generalized alpha method for the generalized alpha method parameters αm αk and γ are set as 0 419 0 459 and 0 54 respectively these three parameters of the generalized alpha method are set the same without specific presented in the following sections the tension of the generalized alpha method is chosen as t n and the comparison results are shown in figs 7 and 8 and table 5 as shown in fig 7 a and c a periodic oscillation of the cable s tension t and shear force s n can be observed for both the cases a and b conversely the high frequency oscillation of the tension is not observed in case c for example 1 2 variation of the shear force s n can be found see in fig 7 c fig 8 shows the three dimensional configuration of the cable it is easily found the time integration method impact the cable profile is trivial as listed in table 5 second as listed in table 4 another five cases are conducted to investigate the number of elements of the cable impacting the dynamic response the tension of case g is chosen as t n the comparison results are shown in figs 9 and 10 fig 9 a and c shows that the larger the element s number is the higher accuracy of the tension and shear force they are fig 10 shows the three dimensional geometric configuration of the cable it is found a higher number of the elements is expected to obtain the higher accuracy of the geometrical configuration of the cable as show in fig 9 and table 5 the numerical solution converges when the 25 elements are used thus the 25 element mesh scheme for the cable will be used in the following sections the generalized alpha time integration scheme will be used in the following sections due to its advantage of eliminating the spurious frequency oscillation when the cable is divided into small segments 3 3 comparison study with the sea trial data in this section numerical simulation cases are conducted and the results are compared with the sea trial data to make the numerical simulation comparable with the sea trial data a proper initial condition of the tcbs is required to reduce the transient motion of the tcbs at the initial stage it was obtained by executing a separate dynamic simulation in which a stationary cable was hanging vertically in the water column was brought up the specific speed until the tcbs enters a steady state equilibrium configuration buckham et al 2003 2004 in this section two different maneuvering operations of the tcbs are conducted the straight and u turn tows here the numerical simulations are conducted with the velocity of the surrounding fluid being zero v c u r 0 due to no data recorded in the sea trial as presented in tables 1 2 two types of cable are used the fairing cable and the bare cable in which the fairing cable is adopted here to reduce the drag force of the cable to achieve a deeper depth sun et al 2011 wang and huang 2012 3 3 1 straight tow operation in this section as listed in table 6 two numerical simulation cases h and i are conducted one for the short length cable and the other for the long length cable the measured data of the towing ship at the connection point of the cable the first node are shown in fig 11 these data are taken as the boundary condition of the cable dynamic in the numerical simulation as listed in eq 20 in the case h the cable is a 375 m length cable with a 125 m fairing cable at the bottom and a 250 m bare cable at the top in this section as listed in table 7 four different schemes are adopted to investigate the number of elements affecting its dynamic response the comparison results are shown in figs 12 and 13 it is easily observed that the accuracy of numerical simulation increases as the number of elements of the cable increases furthermore the results are convergent as the number of elements increases see fig 12 however the difference between the numerical simulation and sea trial experimental data still can be observed even for the cable is divided into 50 elements the computational loads increase significantly when the number of elements is 50 however as shown in figs 12 and 13 the results do not increase significantly thus the first mesh scheme is applied from a saving computational load perspective the comparison results between the first mesh scheme and sea trial data are shown in fig 14 as shown in fig 11 the towing ship linearly accelerates from 1 85 m s to 2 10 m s in 500 s therefore the towed body is gradually lifted as the accelerated towing ship leading an increase of the normal drag force of the cable see fig 14 a from the comparison results of the z b position coordinate of the towed body and the tension at the towing ship side it can be seen that the numerical results match well with the sea trial data however as shown in fig 14 c e a distinct discrepancy in the attitude motion of the towed body is observed i e the pitch and yaw angles three reasons can be attributed i the velocity of the surrounding fluid is not recorded in the sea trial that leads to a difference in the hydrodynamic force of the towed body ii there is a difference exists in the initial condition between the numerical simulation and sea trial data for the numerical simulation the initial conditions of the tcbs are obtained by running a steady state straight tow simulation buckham et al 2003 conversely there are no records for the sea trial data iii there is a difference existing in the towed body s hydrodynamic force coefficients due to the deviation in geometry surface finishing and the mass of towed body arising from the manufacturing process therefore to improve the prediction accuracy of the attitude motion of the towed body the hydrodynamic coefficients of the towed body should be further analyzed and calibrated with the sea trial data in this section it can be concluded that the predicted response of the cable matches well with the sea trial data however a discrepancy in the attitude of the towed body is observed in the case of i the cable is a 20 m fairing cable it represents the beginning phase in the deployment or recovering processes the other physical properties of the fairing cable are listed in table 1 the cable is equally discretized into 25 elements as recommended in the last section the measured data of the towing ship at the connection point of the cable the first node are shown in fig 15 these data are taken as the boundary condition of the cable dynamic in the numerical simulation as listed in eq 20 the comparison results between the numerical simulation and sea trial data are shown in fig 16 fig 16 shows the variation of the towed body s position coordinate along z b axis the tension at the first node and the attitude of the towed body roll pitch and yaw angles it is easily seen that the results of the numerical simulation fit the sea trial data well see fig 16 a d however a slight discrepancy in the yaw angle is observed the reason is that there is a difference in the initial conditions of the attitude of the towed body this difference is easily noticed at the initial stage in the attitude of the towed body see in fig 16 e 3 3 2 u turn tow operation in this section the ship starts from a straight steady state tow and then performs a u turn with a specific radius after the u turn it returns to a straight steady state tow course in the opposite direction as listed in table 5 another two simulations cases are conducted in the case of j the cable is a 20 m fairing cable and the mesh discrete scheme of the cable is set the same as case h as pointed out at beginning of the simulation part the initial condition of this case is obtained by running a separate dynamic simulation of the tcbs from a rest situation to the specific speed 2 0586 m s the steady state results of this separate dynamic simulation are taken as the initial conditions for the case j buckham et al 2004 li et al 2019 as shown in fig 17 the towing ship starts from a straight steady tow 2 0586 m s in the first 75 s and then performs a u turn with a turning speed of 30 deg min finally it returns to a straight tow 1 9035 m s in opposite direction the comparison results are shown in figs 18 and 19 the same conclusion can be obtained that the results of numerical simulation agree with the sea trial data well for instance as shown in fig 18 e the yaw of the towed body between the numerical simulation and the sea trial data matches well furthermore as shown in fig 19 the trajectory of the towed body closely follows the towing ship s trajectory inside the circle it shows the towed body sharing the center of the towing ship s turn and the radius of the towed body is slightly smaller than the radius of the towing ship the phenomenon has been demonstrated in previous references grosenbaugh 2007 wang and sun 2015 however a distinct discrepancy in the pitch of the towed body is found seen in fig 18 d the same reasons presented in the last section can be attributed besides the drop down phenomenon in the z b position coordinate of the towed body at the turning stage is not observed for both the numerical simulation results and experimental data the reasons are twofold i the application of the low drag fairing cable ii the velocity of the towing ship at the turning stage is not changed significantly for instance for the case j as shown in fig 17 the velocity of the towing ship decreases from 2 0586 m s to 1 5948 m s in the first half circle then it returns to 1 9035 m s in the second half circle and keeps that speed to the end in the case of k the cable is the same as the case h and the mesh discrete scheme also set the same as the case h as shown in figs 20 and 22 a the towing ship starts from a steady state straight tow course 2 28 m s in the first 44 s then performs a u turn with a turning speed of 40 deg min finally it returns to the steady state straight tow 2 28 m s in an opposite direction the comparison results are shown in figs 21 and 22 different from the phenomena of the case j a typical drop down phenomenon of the z b position coordinate of the towed body is observed see fig 21 a grosenbaugh 2007 for instance the towed body dives deeper due to the decrease of the velocity of the towing ship at the first half stage of the u turn and then it goes upper due to the increase of the velocity of the towing ship at the second half stage of the u turn as shown in figs 21 e and fig 22 the towed body follows the trajectory of the towing ship with a delay for example the delay phenomenon of the towed body s yaw angle has been presented for 180 turning maneuvers simulations grosenbaugh 2007 yuan et al 2017 fig 21 d and e shows the difference in the attitude of the towed body pitch and yaw angles is obvious which indicates the hydrodynamic coefficients of the towed body should be further analyzed finally we can conclude that the results of the numerical simulation fit well with the sea trial data and the proposed approach is reliable the hydrodynamic coefficients of the towed body should be further calibrated with the sea trial data due to the discrepancy in the attitude motion of the towed body 4 conclusions a high fidelity mathematical model of the towed cable body system has been developed and implemented the cable with the flexural and torsional stiffnesses is approximated by the finite difference scheme in the space domain meanwhile a six degrees of freedom model of the towed body was incorporated into the cable dynamics then the dynamics of the towed cable and the towed body are simultaneously solved by using the generalized alpha algorithm with a property of controllable numerical dissipation in the high frequency range while minimizing the unwanted low frequency dissipation first the sensitivity analysis of different time integration methods and the number of elements has been conducted for the dynamics of the towed cable body system then numerical simulations are conducted for different maneuvers including the straight and u turn tows the comparison results between the numerical simulation and the sea trial data show the numerical simulation agree with the sea trial data well the proposed method is a highly accurate method that is reliable so it can be used to predict the response of the towed cable body system credit authorship contribution statement yanyan zhao writing original draft code programming data curation gangqiang

20924,a full coupled three dimensional dynamic model of a towed cable body system is developed the towed cable with the axial elasticity bending stiffness and torsional stiffness is approximated by the finite difference method the towed body is model as a rigid body with six degrees of freedom that seamlessly incorporated into the cable dynamics the generalized alpha algorithm is applied as the time integration method first the sensitivity analysis of the different time integration methods and the number of elements impacting the dynamic response is conducted then numerical simulations are conducted for different maneuvers the straight tow and the u turn tow and the results are compared to the experimental sea trial data the comparison results show the proposed approach matches the sea trial data well and the prediction response based on the proposed method is reliable keywords cable dynamics towed body finite difference method generalized alpha sea trial data 1 introduction the increasing exploration of the subsea resources and the mapping of seafloor terrain led to an extensive investigation into the towed cable body systems tcbs to reduce the substantial risk associated with the design of tcbs that composes of a towing ship a towed cable and a towed body a robust numerical simulation program is necessarily needed the maneuvering performance of the tcbs could be evaluated which supplies guidance to the towing maneuverability improves the performance of the tcbs and enhances the safety of the towing activity in the last decades many efforts have been devoted to developing numerical methods for the nonlinear dynamics of the tcbs whereas the characteristic of the cable s nonlinear geometry nonlinear material property and nonlinear hydrodynamic forces are considered among them the following four methods for modeling the towed cable are generally adopted the finite difference method fdm chatjigeorgiou 2008 chatjigeorgiou 2010a doan and nishi 2014 feng and allen 2004 howell et al 1992 park et al 2003 wang and sun 2015 wu and chwang 2000 yuan et al 2014 the lumped parameter method lpm calnan et al 2019 driscoll et al 2000 du et al 2019 huang 1994 williams 2006 yang et al 2013 the finite element method fem buckham et al 2004 li et al 2019 luis et al 2020 quan et al 2015 sun et al 2011 the slender rod flexible segment method fsm chen et al 2001 kamman and huston 1985 xu and zou 2015 firstly for the fdm the governing equations are derived from the principle of balance of forces and equilibrium of moments about an infinitesimal segment of cable the fdm cable model developed by ablow and schechter 1983 and howell et al 1992 is worthy to note but it still has some limitations such as the ignoring of the cable s rotary inertia terms the singularity of euler angles and the singularity for a slacking cable achievements have been made to address these mentioned limitations for example chatjigeorgiou 2010a 2010b 2013 develops a novel model considering the rotary inertia terms of the cable and they use it to investigate the dynamics of a drilling rotating cable and the dynamics of a pipe with internal fluids running along its length hover 1997 tjavaras et al 1998 develop a model that the euler parameters are replacing the euler angles to describe the cable s attitude motion and they use it to predict the dynamic response of the highly extensible breaking line to overcome the singularity due to tether slack howell et al 1992 shabana and yakoub 2000 develop a model including bending stiffness of the cable secondly the lpm cable model is widely used due to its mathematical simplicity and easy understanding and implementation huang 1994 williams et al 2006 yang et al 2013 a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations can be directly derived from the second law of newton the notable lpm cable model is developed by huang 1994 williams et al 2006 williams and trivailo 2007 and buckham et al 2003 the bending stiffness of the cable is included to address the singularity problem due to the slack of tether buckham et al 2003 2004 thirdly the fem is categorized into two approaches the conventional finite element formulation cfef and the absolute nodal coordinate formulation ancf for the cfef the displacement is used as the state variable and its current position is updated by adding the current displacement up to its previous position buckham et al 2004 and quan et al 2015 2016 adopt the cfef to investigate the dynamic behavior of a low tension tether for the deep sea remotely operated vehicle system for the ancf the position and its gradient are used as state variables sun et al 2011 li and zhu 2019 kim et al 2012 park and kim 2015 deng et al 2018 kawaguti et al 2007 takehara et al 2011 li et al 2015 and zhu 2010 adopt the ancf method to predict the dynamic response of the tcbs finally for the fsm the cable is divided into a series of small segments or rods which experiences a large longitudinal and lateral deformation huston and kamman 1982 kamman and huston 1985 it has been successfully employed to predict the dynamic response of a submerged cable system kamman and huston 1985 2001 the mooring line system chen et al 2001 and the riser system xu et al 2013 xu and zou 2015 for these four mentioned modeling methods each method has each own merits and limitations more detailed information related to the modeling methods of the cable can be found in refs chatjigeorgiou 2008 jain 1994 li and zhu 2019 patel and seyed 1995 in the current paper the fdm is adopted to model the tcbs due to its easy implementation and validation purpose with existing references another critical aspect of the modeling of tcbs is the time integration method in the past decades many studies are devoted to this field gobat et al 2002 koh and rong 2004 li et al 2015 li and zhu 2015 tian et al 2009 zhang and zhang 2016 initially the keller box scheme with second order accuracy is proposed to solve the cable dynamics chatjigeorgiou 2010a 2010b huo et al 2011 park et al 2003 wang et al 2012 wang and sun 2015 however a nonphysical high frequency oscillation is generated furthermore this method has poor numerical stability and is susceptible to crank nicholson noise gobat et al 2002 koh et al 1999 wang et al 2012 later a modified box scheme is proposed to address these defects however this method only has a first order accuracy koh et al 1999 to overcome the accuracy order reduction the generalized alpha method with controllable numerical numbering has been proposed chung and hulbert 1993 gobat and grosenbaugh 2001 gobat et al 2002 it is a second order accuracy approach in both space and time domains it has been widely for the dynamic simulation of the cable tether duo to its easy set the numerical damping through these three parameters α m α k and γ quan et al 2015 tian et al 2009 therefore in the current paper the generalized alpha algorithm is adopted as the time integration method for the tcbs in the current paper the models of the cable and towed body are assembled as the standard procedure in the finite element method firstly the sensitivity analysis of the different time integration methods and the number of elements impacting the dynamic response of the tcbs is conducted then the numerical simulations are conducted in different cable configurations and different tow cases including the straight and turning tows the numerical simulations are compared to sea trial data the results show that the numerical simulation agrees satisfactorily with the sea trial data and the proposed method can be applied to study the dynamic behavior of the tcbs 2 mathematical formulation of towed cable body system 2 1 coordinate systems as shown in fig 1 the motion of the tcbs is described by three orthogonal coordinate systems a global inertial coordinate system oxyz a towed body fixed coordinate system o x y z and a local lagrangian coordinate system otnb the origin o of the global inertial coordinate system is locating at the still water level where the positive x axis points to the straightforward direction the positive z axis points to the vertical downwards and the y axis completes a right hand coordinate system the body fixed coordinate system is a moving frame which is attached to the towed body the origin o of the towed body fixed coordinate system is at center of mass cm of the towed body with x axis being the longitudinal axis directed from aft to fore and z axis pointing to the vertical downwards direction and the y axis completes a right hand coordinate system the transformation matrix t b 2 g from the towed body fixed coordinate system to the global inertial coordinate system is 1 t b 2 g c ψ c θ c ψ s θ s φ c φ s ψ c φ c ψ s θ s φ s ψ c θ s ψ c φ c ψ s θ s φ s ψ c ψ sin φ c φ s θ s ψ s θ c θ s φ c θ c φ where symbols c and s denote cosine and sine functions respectively φ θ and ψ are roll pitch and yaw rotation angles of the towed body respectively the origin o of the local lagrangian coordinate system otnb is locating at points along the cable centerline axis where the positive t axis points in the local tangent direction of cable starting from the upper towing point the positive n axis points in the normal direction the direction of curvature and the b axis completes a right handed coordinates system the transformation matrix t l 2 g from the lagrangian coordinate system to the global inertial coordinate system is 2 t l 2 g s α c β c α s α s β s β 0 c β c α c β s α c α s β where α is in plane rotation angle that represents the rotation angle about the y axis into the o t n plane β is out of plane rotation angle about the x axis bring oxy plane into coincidence with plane o t n see in fig 1 2 2 formulation of the cable dynamics considering a stretched segment of the cable 1 ε d s where ds is the unstretched length of the infinitesimal segment and ε is axial strain of this infinitesimal segment letting v l u v w t f i l t s n s b t and m l m t m n m b t denote vectors of velocity internal force and moment in the local lagrangian coordinate system where u v and w are the velocity variables and t s n and s b are the force variables denoting the tension in plane and out of plane shear forces respectively m t m n and m b are the moment variables denoting the axial torsion the in plane bending moment and the out of plane bending moment respectively the equations of motion eom of the cable dynamics are derived from the conservation of

ρ c a v l ω v l f i l ω f i l 1 ε f w l 1 ε f h y l 1 ε f a l where ρ c and a are the material density and the cross section area of the cable segment respectively f e l e w h y a are the vectors of external forces with superscript l representing the term expressed in the local lagrangian coordinate system chatjigeorgiou 2008 howell et al 1992 and the subscripts w hy and a represents the net weight hydrodynamic force and added inertia due to the surrounding fluid per unit stretched length respectively the symbols overhead dot and overhead prime denotes the first order derivative with to time and length respectively ω ω t ω n ω b t and ω ω t ω n ω b t are the darboux vector of rotation velocity and local curvature respectively in the current paper the angular rotation along the t axis of the local coordinate frame is set as zero duo to the absent of end moments in torsion howell et al 1992 this removes the rotation angle along the t axis out of the state variable 4 ω ω t ω n ω b t α s β β α c β t 5 ω ω t ω n ω b t α s β β α c β t where c and s denote the cos and sin function for the local curvature ω there are only two independent variables ω n and ω b ω t ω b s β c β is removed from the state variable 2 2 2 balance of moments another set of equations can be derived from the balance of moments for the left hand side of this incremental segment chatjigeorgiou 2008 2010b chatjigeorgiou 2010b howell et al 1992 such that 6 m l ω m l 1 ε 3 t f l 0 where t is a unit vector along the tangent direction in the local lagrangian coordinate system 2 2 3 compatibility relationship based on the free of continuity of the stretched segment the cable position r s t is a continuous function of two independent variables the lagrangian coordinate s and time t moreover the partial derivatives r and r are continuous in s and t 7 d d t r d d s r substituting r v l and r 1 ε t into eq 7 yields 8 ε t 1 ε ω t v l ω v l 2 2 4 final governing equations the eom of the infinitesimal segment ds are obtained by combination of eqs 3 8 with t e a ε and they are written in vectoral form chatjigeorgiou 2008 koh and rong 2004 park et al 2003 9 m c y c k c y c n c 0 where y c u v w ω n ω b α β ε s n s b t is state variables vector m c and k c are mass and stiffness matrices respectively n c is external forces vector their detailed expressions can be found in appendix a 2 2 5 boundary condition of the cable as presented in refs chatjigeorgiou 2008 tjavaras et al 1998 yuan et al 2014 the cable is supposed to be connected by the pinned joints at the two ends of the cable thus zero of the bending moment of the first node and last nodes of the cable are written as 10 ω 2 0 t ω 3 0 t 0 11 ω 2 l c t ω 3 l c t 0 where l c is the stretched length of the cable the two point boundary value problem as listed in eq 9 is a solvable problem with a property boundary conditions ten boundary conditions are needed all the time yuan et al 2017 yuan et al 2014 in additional to the eqs 10 and 11 six boundary conditions are needed in the current paper these six conditions are relating to the velocity of the first and last nodes of the cable they will be given at the section

towed body as presented in refs chatjigeorgiou 2008 tjavaras et al 1998 yuan et al 2014 the cable is supposed to be connected by the pinned joints at the ends of the cable for the towing ship end of the cable we are assuming the mass of the towing ship is much larger than the total mass of the cable and towed body grosenbaugh 2007 wang and sun 2015 thus it leads that the towing ship influences the cable and the cable s effect on the towing ship is ignored thus the first node of the cable shares the velocity of towing ship and it is written as 20 u 0 t v 0 t w 0 t t l 2 g t v s g where t l 2 g t is the transformation matrix as listed in eq 2 with superscript t denoting the transpose matrix v s g v s x g v s y g v s z g t is a vector of the velocity of the towing ship with superscript g denoting the global inertial coordinate system and it is an input value in the simulation for the towed body end of the cable the dynamic effect between the cable and the towed body is considered as follows i the cable force exerted on the towed body is applied as listed in eq 16 ii the dynamic effect of the towed body on the cable is implemented by imposing a known value to the velocity of the last node of the cable it means the cable shares the velocity of the towed body at the towed body end gao and wang 2018 yuan et al 2017 yuan et al 2014 the velocity is calculated as 21 u l c t v l c t

eq 21 can be found in appendix c 2 5 discretization of the towed cable body system as presented in last section the towing ship is imposed as prescribed boundary condition as listed in eq 20 thus the eoms of the tcbs are obtained by combing eq 9 and eq 17 with consideration of the coupling effect as listed in eq 16 and eq 21 in current paper the central differencing scheme is taken as the spatial scheme for the cable and the generalized alpha method gobat and grosenbaugh 2001 is taken as the temporal discretization scheme for the cable and towed body 2 5 1 spatial discretization of the towed cable the eom of the towed cable listed in eq 9 is a partial differential equation that needs to be discretized in space firstly supposing the cable with a constant length l c is divided into n elements with n 1 nodes taking the j th element as an example j 1 n eq 9 is discretized in space using the central differencing scheme then a set of semi discretized equations are obtained as 22 m c j y c j k c j y c j n c j 0 where y c j y c j y c j 1 t is elemental state variables vector with subscripts j and j 1 referring to nodes of the j th element m c j and k c j are elemental mass and stiffness matrices respectively n c j is external loads vector of the j th element respectively gobat et al 2002 after the eoms of the j th element are obtained then the eoms of the cable with n elements can be obtained by the standard assembly procedure in the conventional finite element method li et al 2015 li and zhu 2015 luis et al 2020 23 m c y c k c y c n c 0 where y c y c 1 y c 2 y c n 1 t is vector of the state variables of the cable with 10 n 1 dimension m c and k c are mass and stiffness matrices with 10 n 1 10 n 1 dimension n c is a vector of the external force with 10 n 1 dimension 2 5 2 temporal discretization of the towed cable the generalized alpha time integration scheme is used to discretize the ordinary differential equation 23 gobat and grosenbaugh 2001 gobat et

al 2002 δ t k is time step size with superscript denoting the current time the numerical solution of eq 24 has a second order accuracy when the parameters α m α k and γ satisfies 26 α m α k γ 0 5 substituting eq 25 into eq 24 to eliminate the unknown vector y c k a new set of nonlinear algebraic equations are generated 27 f 1 δ t k γ α m 1 1 α m m c k α m m k 1 y c k 1 δ t k γ α k 1 α k k c k

velocity vector y c k 1 at previous time is as a known value in obtaining the y c k then the velocity vector y c k is updated for calculating y c k 1 at next time step 28 y c k y c k y c k 1 δ t k 1 γ y c k 1 δ t k γ 2 5 3 temporal discretization of the towed body here the first order differential equation 17 is also discretized by the generalized alpha method it is written as 29 1 α m m b k y b k

and the towed body are discretized by the generalized alpha method the total algebraic equations of the tcbs are obtained by assembling eqs 27 and 31 33 g y f 1 f 2 t where y y c 1 y c 2 y c n 1 y b t is a vector of combined the state variables of the tcbs with 10 n 1 12 dimension in the current paper the newton raphson iteration algorithm is used to solve the algebraic equation 33 denote y k m is an approximation value of the y with superscript k m representing m th iteration at current time k 34 y k m 1 y k m δ y k m where δ y k m is calculated as 35 j δ y k m g y k m 0 where j g y is the jacobian matrix of the eq 33 with respect to state variable vector y and its analytical mathematic expression can be achieved as shown in fig 2 most of the nonzero submatrices are the block tridiagonal form the effect of the towing ship is applied as the prescribed boundary condition as listed eq 20 the coupling terms between the cable and towed body are generated by the eqs 16 and 21 2 7 position coordinate evaluation of the towed cable the state variables of the cable y c u v w ω n ω b α β ε s n s b t does not explicitly contain the position coordinate x y z t however the position coordinate of the cable is needed to know for evaluating the cable s velocity relative to the surrounding fluid and the velocity profile along the cable length in the current paper the position coordinate of the cable is calculated by eq 36 and its discretization form is obtained by the euler method as listed in appendix d 36 x y z 1 ε s α c β 1 ε s β 1 ε c α c β 3 simulation results and discussion in the current paper the two parameters controlling the accuracy of the newton raphson iteration scheme the residual criterion and the maximum iteration number are set as to 10 8 and 50 respectively the physical parameters of the tcbs are listed in tables 1 3 where the cable contains two types the fairing and bare types the hydrodynamic force coefficients of the towed body are obtained based on the scale model experiment from ref li et al 2015 sun et al 2011 3 1 validation of the proposed method in the section three cases are carried out to validate the proposed method by comparing the nodal position finite element method npfem sun et al 2011 the steady state straight tow at different speeds 5 10 and 15 knots is studied the range of the speed covers most operation range of the towed system sun et al 2011 as shown in fig 3 the towing ship initially starts from a rest situation at a specific constant acceleration to the target speed it then keeps that speed until the steady state configuration is achieved for the comparison purpose the main physical parameters of the towed body and cable are temporary kept the same as the values in ref sun et al 2011 additional parameters of the cable corresponding to its bending motion are listed in tables 1 2 it is because the rod element model is used in the npfem in this section the 460 m length cable is combined by a 325 m bare cable and a 125 m fairing cable the mesh scheme is the same as presented in sun et al 2011 where the 250 m bare cable is uniformly divided into nine elements and the 125 m fairing cable is uniformly divided into three elements the time step size is 0 001 s the results are shown in figs 4 and 5 fig 4 shows the comparison results of steady state cable configuration at these three towing speeds it demonstrates that the match between the present model and the npfem is good however a slight difference can still be observed due to the elemental model s difference where both the axial elongation and bending motions are considered in the present method the npfem only considers the axial elongation motion of the cable fig 5 shows the cable s geometrical configuration time variation when the tcbs is towed from a vertical rest situation to a steady state situation 3 2 sensitivity analysis of the towed cable body system in this section the sensitivity analysis of different time integration methods and the number of elements is conducted in this section the cable is a 150 m fairing cable and its parameters are listed in table 1 the towing ship moves along the positive x axis direction and the velocity profile of the towing ship is shown in fig 6 where the initial velocity of the towing ship is 1 03 m s 2 knots the towing ship accelerates linearly from 1 03 m s to 3 08 m s 6 knots in the 50 s and maintains that speed for 50 s then decelerates linearly from 3 08 m s to 1 03 m s in the last 50s to obtain the steady state of the tcbs at 1 03 m s towing speed an additional dynamic simulation for the tcbs is conducted by bringing the system from a rest situation to the target speed 1 03 m s then the steady solution of this simulation is fed as the initial condition buckham et al 2004 see in fig 6 b the gray line with square symbol furthermore to evaluate the performance of each case in the sensitivity study a new ratio r t i t n is defined where t i i a g is the tension of the cable for each case here the tension of the element connected to the towed body is taken t n is a normalized value that will be given later first as listed in table 4 three cases are conducted to investigate the time integration methods impacting the dynamic response of the system for these three cases a b and c the cable is equally divided into 25 elements and the time step size is set as 0 001s here three different time integration methods are adopted the keller box method the trapezoidal method and the generalized alpha method for the generalized alpha method parameters αm αk and γ are set as 0 419 0 459 and 0 54 respectively these three parameters of the generalized alpha method are set the same without specific presented in the following sections the tension of the generalized alpha method is chosen as t n and the comparison results are shown in figs 7 and 8 and table 5 as shown in fig 7 a and c a periodic oscillation of the cable s tension t and shear force s n can be observed for both the cases a and b conversely the high frequency oscillation of the tension is not observed in case c for example 1 2 variation of the shear force s n can be found see in fig 7 c fig 8 shows the three dimensional configuration of the cable it is easily found the time integration method impact the cable profile is trivial as listed in table 5 second as listed in table 4 another five cases are conducted to investigate the number of elements of the cable impacting the dynamic response the tension of case g is chosen as t n the comparison results are shown in figs 9 and 10 fig 9 a and c shows that the larger the element s number is the higher accuracy of the tension and shear force they are fig 10 shows the three dimensional geometric configuration of the cable it is found a higher number of the elements is expected to obtain the higher accuracy of the geometrical configuration of the cable as show in fig 9 and table 5 the numerical solution converges when the 25 elements are used thus the 25 element mesh scheme for the cable will be used in the following sections the generalized alpha time integration scheme will be used in the following sections due to its advantage of eliminating the spurious frequency oscillation when the cable is divided into small segments 3 3 comparison study with the sea trial data in this section numerical simulation cases are conducted and the results are compared with the sea trial data to make the numerical simulation comparable with the sea trial data a proper initial condition of the tcbs is required to reduce the transient motion of the tcbs at the initial stage it was obtained by executing a separate dynamic simulation in which a stationary cable was hanging vertically in the water column was brought up the specific speed until the tcbs enters a steady state equilibrium configuration buckham et al 2003 2004 in this section two different maneuvering operations of the tcbs are conducted the straight and u turn tows here the numerical simulations are conducted with the velocity of the surrounding fluid being zero v c u r 0 due to no data recorded in the sea trial as presented in tables 1 2 two types of cable are used the fairing cable and the bare cable in which the fairing cable is adopted here to reduce the drag force of the cable to achieve a deeper depth sun et al 2011 wang and huang 2012 3 3 1 straight tow operation in this section as listed in table 6 two numerical simulation cases h and i are conducted one for the short length cable and the other for the long length cable the measured data of the towing ship at the connection point of the cable the first node are shown in fig 11 these data are taken as the boundary condition of the cable dynamic in the numerical simulation as listed in eq 20 in the case h the cable is a 375 m length cable with a 125 m fairing cable at the bottom and a 250 m bare cable at the top in this section as listed in table 7 four different schemes are adopted to investigate the number of elements affecting its dynamic response the comparison results are shown in figs 12 and 13 it is easily observed that the accuracy of numerical simulation increases as the number of elements of the cable increases furthermore the results are convergent as the number of elements increases see fig 12 however the difference between the numerical simulation and sea trial experimental data still can be observed even for the cable is divided into 50 elements the computational loads increase significantly when the number of elements is 50 however as shown in figs 12 and 13 the results do not increase significantly thus the first mesh scheme is applied from a saving computational load perspective the comparison results between the first mesh scheme and sea trial data are shown in fig 14 as shown in fig 11 the towing ship linearly accelerates from 1 85 m s to 2 10 m s in 500 s therefore the towed body is gradually lifted as the accelerated towing ship leading an increase of the normal drag force of the cable see fig 14 a from the comparison results of the z b position coordinate of the towed body and the tension at the towing ship side it can be seen that the numerical results match well with the sea trial data however as shown in fig 14 c e a distinct discrepancy in the attitude motion of the towed body is observed i e the pitch and yaw angles three reasons can be attributed i the velocity of the surrounding fluid is not recorded in the sea trial that leads to a difference in the hydrodynamic force of the towed body ii there is a difference exists in the initial condition between the numerical simulation and sea trial data for the numerical simulation the initial conditions of the tcbs are obtained by running a steady state straight tow simulation buckham et al 2003 conversely there are no records for the sea trial data iii there is a difference existing in the towed body s hydrodynamic force coefficients due to the deviation in geometry surface finishing and the mass of towed body arising from the manufacturing process therefore to improve the prediction accuracy of the attitude motion of the towed body the hydrodynamic coefficients of the towed body should be further analyzed and calibrated with the sea trial data in this section it can be concluded that the predicted response of the cable matches well with the sea trial data however a discrepancy in the attitude of the towed body is observed in the case of i the cable is a 20 m fairing cable it represents the beginning phase in the deployment or recovering processes the other physical properties of the fairing cable are listed in table 1 the cable is equally discretized into 25 elements as recommended in the last section the measured data of the towing ship at the connection point of the cable the first node are shown in fig 15 these data are taken as the boundary condition of the cable dynamic in the numerical simulation as listed in eq 20 the comparison results between the numerical simulation and sea trial data are shown in fig 16 fig 16 shows the variation of the towed body s position coordinate along z b axis the tension at the first node and the attitude of the towed body roll pitch and yaw angles it is easily seen that the results of the numerical simulation fit the sea trial data well see fig 16 a d however a slight discrepancy in the yaw angle is observed the reason is that there is a difference in the initial conditions of the attitude of the towed body this difference is easily noticed at the initial stage in the attitude of the towed body see in fig 16 e 3 3 2 u turn tow operation in this section the ship starts from a straight steady state tow and then performs a u turn with a specific radius after the u turn it returns to a straight steady state tow course in the opposite direction as listed in table 5 another two simulations cases are conducted in the case of j the cable is a 20 m fairing cable and the mesh discrete scheme of the cable is set the same as case h as pointed out at beginning of the simulation part the initial condition of this case is obtained by running a separate dynamic simulation of the tcbs from a rest situation to the specific speed 2 0586 m s the steady state results of this separate dynamic simulation are taken as the initial conditions for the case j buckham et al 2004 li et al 2019 as shown in fig 17 the towing ship starts from a straight steady tow 2 0586 m s in the first 75 s and then performs a u turn with a turning speed of 30 deg min finally it returns to a straight tow 1 9035 m s in opposite direction the comparison results are shown in figs 18 and 19 the same conclusion can be obtained that the results of numerical simulation agree with the sea trial data well for instance as shown in fig 18 e the yaw of the towed body between the numerical simulation and the sea trial data matches well furthermore as shown in fig 19 the trajectory of the towed body closely follows the towing ship s trajectory inside the circle it shows the towed body sharing the center of the towing ship s turn and the radius of the towed body is slightly smaller than the radius of the towing ship the phenomenon has been demonstrated in previous references grosenbaugh 2007 wang and sun 2015 however a distinct discrepancy in the pitch of the towed body is found seen in fig 18 d the same reasons presented in the last section can be attributed besides the drop down phenomenon in the z b position coordinate of the towed body at the turning stage is not observed for both the numerical simulation results and experimental data the reasons are twofold i the application of the low drag fairing cable ii the velocity of the towing ship at the turning stage is not changed significantly for instance for the case j as shown in fig 17 the velocity of the towing ship decreases from 2 0586 m s to 1 5948 m s in the first half circle then it returns to 1 9035 m s in the second half circle and keeps that speed to the end in the case of k the cable is the same as the case h and the mesh discrete scheme also set the same as the case h as shown in figs 20 and 22 a the towing ship starts from a steady state straight tow course 2 28 m s in the first 44 s then performs a u turn with a turning speed of 40 deg min finally it returns to the steady state straight tow 2 28 m s in an opposite direction the comparison results are shown in figs 21 and 22 different from the phenomena of the case j a typical drop down phenomenon of the z b position coordinate of the towed body is observed see fig 21 a grosenbaugh 2007 for instance the towed body dives deeper due to the decrease of the velocity of the towing ship at the first half stage of the u turn and then it goes upper due to the increase of the velocity of the towing ship at the second half stage of the u turn as shown in figs 21 e and fig 22 the towed body follows the trajectory of the towing ship with a delay for example the delay phenomenon of the towed body s yaw angle has been presented for 180 turning maneuvers simulations grosenbaugh 2007 yuan et al 2017 fig 21 d and e shows the difference in the attitude of the towed body pitch and yaw angles is obvious which indicates the hydrodynamic coefficients of the towed body should be further analyzed finally we can conclude that the results of the numerical simulation fit well with the sea trial data and the proposed approach is reliable the hydrodynamic coefficients of the towed body should be further calibrated with the sea trial data due to the discrepancy in the attitude motion of the towed body 4 conclusions a high fidelity mathematical model of the towed cable body system has been developed and implemented the cable with the flexural and torsional stiffnesses is approximated by the finite difference scheme in the space domain meanwhile a six degrees of freedom model of the towed body was incorporated into the cable dynamics then the dynamics of the towed cable and the towed body are simultaneously solved by using the generalized alpha algorithm with a property of controllable numerical dissipation in the high frequency range while minimizing the unwanted low frequency dissipation first the sensitivity analysis of different time integration methods and the number of elements has been conducted for the dynamics of the towed cable body system then numerical simulations are conducted for different maneuvers including the straight and u turn tows the comparison results between the numerical simulation and the sea trial data show the numerical simulation agree with the sea trial data well the proposed method is a highly accurate method that is reliable so it can be used to predict the response of the towed cable body system credit authorship contribution statement yanyan zhao writing original draft code programming data curation gangqiang
