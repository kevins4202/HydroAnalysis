4825,the formation of urban coastal flooding is mainly ruled by the interaction between rainfall runoff and storm surge this study aims to advance the understanding of coastal urban flood mechanism by developing an integrated modeling and multivariate analysis framework which involves a hydrologic model storm water management model swmm as the core model coupled with a coastal hydrodynamic model delft3d the uncertainty associated with the flood depth prediction by integrated models is analyzed using the multivariate gaussian copula the performance of the integrated modeling framework is evaluated for the chittagong city of bangladesh which has experienced extreme and frequent coastal urban floods results from modeling indicate that changes in the tidal phase of coastal urban flooding alter the flood s duration and depth the intensity of compound flooding is higher for the co occurrence of rainfall and surge peaks than the occurrence of both events in succession the average flood duration and depth can be increased by about 2 5 h and 0 24 m respectively during compound events when the storm surge occurs during the transition phase between high low tides 2 4 h before peak low high tide the duration of flood extends due to longer surge duration 4 4 5 h finally the multivariate gaussian copula model adjusts the integrated modeling outputs and enhances the skill to predict the inundation depth by 4 6 24 3 the findings of this study are critical for a better understanding of coastal urban flood processes and enhancing the informed decision making for emergency management and planning in low lying coastal regions keywords coastal urban flood integrated modeling framework copula functions multivariate probability compound flooding 1 introduction coastal floods and their respective damage are anticipated to be increased during the next decades hinkel et al 2014 the total number of category 4 and 5 hurricanes in north indian ocean had been increased by about 138 during 1986 1995 to 1996 2005 klotzbach 2006 estimated damage of tropical cyclones tcs shows a rising trend particularly where the tcs wind speed is more than 0 15 ms 1 yr elsner et al 2008 while the coastal population and developments are growing larger coastal cities will be much exposed to the more frequent and intense floods de sherbinin et al 2007 just in 2005 the losses from flooding events around the world was estimated about us 6 billion this number is projected to be about us 52 billion by 2050 hallegatte et al 2013 when a tc makes landfall it initiates tidal surges and brings heavy rainfalls which in turn can causes a compound flooding event in coastal regions tcs in the bay of bengal bring heavy rainfalls about 2 500 5 000 mm yr which are mainly accumulated over the coastal region of the bangladesh and india gaona et al 2018 in this region approximately 9 5 of annual rainfall is originated from the tropical cyclones prat and nelson 2013 hence the coastal flood often occurs in presence of combined storm surges and heavy rainfalls referred as compound flooding particularly more in urban areas compound events are formed by combination of multiple climate drivers where in many cases these extreme events poses overwhelming environmental risks exceeding the natural coping capacity zscheischler et al 2020 compound flood can be formed by a single meteorological event such as a tropical cyclone and extreme precipitation or during successive meteorological events silva araya et al 2018 bacopoulos et al 2016 2009 bilskie and hagen 2018 santiago collazo et al 2019 for example prolonged precipitation events due to formation of a low pressure system during high tide storm surge events can cause compound floods as well serafin et al 2019 the key mechanism of compound flood underlines the rainfall runoff and storm tidal surge interaction the compound flood is often more intense in low gradient coastal areas located in adjacent to tidal rivers or regions which are experiencing significant sea level rise slr comer et al 2017 several factors are involved in formation and intensification of a coastal urban flood such as urbanization climate change and sea level rise one driver is the high imperviousness of urban watersheds which results in shorter runoff response time and higher peak flows shahapure et al 2010 slr is an emerging threat for increasing the incidents of compound flooding in coastal regions bilskie et al 2019 2016 passeri et al 2015 moftakhari et al 2019 the persistence emission of greenhouse gasses and growth of human activities may result in 1 m of slr by 2100 kopp et al 2014 the slr eliminates the freeboard between flood stage and high tide datum vandenberg rodes et al 2016 in low level and low gradient coastal systems depending on topography and bathymetry the system can be tide dominated wave dominated or often a mixed dynamic between high tides and waves can be seen as dominated behavior for the surge modulation critical space and time scales depends on tidal surge amplitude and phase shift with tide horsburgh and wilson 2007 when high tide or tidal surge propagates through the drainage system it delays the drainage of runoff the timing of surge propagation controls the coastal flood duration as the higher water level at drainage outfall can extend the flood duration bunya et al 2010 it is imperative to more precisely investigate and model the underlying physical process of multiple flood drivers including tides waves river discharge and local rainfall in order to enhance our understanding of coastal urban flooding individual and disconnected modeling of flooding events as fluvial pluvial coastal floods can be performed by use of hydrologic or hydrodynamic models however multivariate analysis of coastal urban flood and representation of rainfall runoff and tidal surge interactions calls for more integrated and holistic modeling frameworks 1 1 integrated modeling of rainfall runoff and storm surge the simulation of joint impacts of rainfall runoff and storm surge requires development of a coupled modeling framework mainly by integrating a hydrologic or hydrodynamic model as the base model with a coastal inundation model bacopoulos et al 2016 2009 bakhtyar et al 2020 bilskie and hagen 2018 santiago collazo et al 2019 ye et al 2020 using a single coastal inundation model often oversimplifies the coastal riverine interactions due to the coarse modeling grids and neglects the inland flood contribution this issue can be potentially solved by combining coastal hydrodynamic models e g sea lake and overland surges from hurricanes slosh glahn et al 2009 semi implicit cross scale hydroscience integrated system model schism zhang et al 2020 advanced circulation adcirc dietrich et al 2011 finite volume coastal ocean model fvcom qi et al 2009 delft3d roelvink and van banning 1995 the princeton ocean model pom ezer and mellor 2000 with riverine flood models e g hydrologic engineering center river analysis system hec ras brunner 2002 lisflood fp coulthard et al 2013 mike hydro river mike 11 jason et al 2015 torres et al 2015 yilu and l 2016 for example karamouz et al 2015 developed an integrated modeling system using a hydraulic model as the base model which is linked to a hydrologic model to represent time variant flow hydrograph of watershed runoff hydrologic model can be used as the base model for the simulation of compound flooding by liking and coupling it with a coastal hydrodynamic model joyce et al 2018 santiago collazo et al 2019 silva araya et al 2018 when a hydrologic model is used as the base model the changing water levels or wave heights at the downstream should be used as the boundary condition from storm surge model several hydrologic models such as us epa storm water management model swmm gironás et al 2010 interconnected channel and pond routing icpr joyce et al 2018 soil and water assessment tool swat douglas mankin et al 2010 and hec hydrologic modeling system hec hms knebl et al 2005 are often explored in different studies to represent the capability of simulating overland flow and flow routing for coastal urban flood e g lewis et al 2013 zahmatkesh et al 2015 hervouet 2007 swmm is capable of simulating both rainfall runoff processes and underground drainage systems hydraulic where the latter simulation has been less addressed by other hydrologic models in a coastal urban setting the pluvial flooding combined with sea level rise can be simulated with swmm sadler et al 2020 storm surge effect can be also simulated using wind speed and pressure as meteorological inputs for the parametric cyclone module of the coastal hydrodynamic models tanim and akter 2019 moreover a mass balance based overland flow model governed by the diffusive wave equation for flow routing with tidal boundary conditions can be used for the simulation of compound floods shahapure et al 2010 however this approach is not an efficient method for the tidal dominated systems such as a bay with complex tide surge interactions an integrated modeling system requires simultaneous exchange and share of information between several computational models depending on the tidal surge or wave characteristics 1 2 model coupling current methods of coupling several numerical models can be classified into 4 classes one way two way tight and fully coupling santiago collazo et al 2019 in a one way coupling framework simulation and computation sequences happen one after the other the two way coupling approach exchanges information between models in an iterative manner and the tightly coupling approach has both models included within the same modeling framework santiago collazo et al 2019 finally fully coupled moldering framework offers solving all the physical processes equations simultaneously in one way coupling framework uncertainty associated with the model parameters boundary conditions and modeling process propagates throughout the linked models in series joyce et al 2018 this calls for novel techniques to quantify track and minimize propagated uncertainty through the modeling process and reduce the systematic errors this novelty is represented in this study by employing the joint probability of random events sklar s theorem and copula functions to quantify the uncertainty in one way coupling framework 1 3 uncertainty analysis of models outputs using copulas model set up process for coastal hydrologic systems is also associated with uncertainty in model parameterization where inaccurate parameters might lead into misfit or oversimplifies of the simulation depending on the model objectives a sets of methods and algorithms have been used for this purpose including copula functions lee and salas 2011 liu et al 2020 pareto front khu and madsen 2005 moore et al 2010 bayesian sampling xu et al 2017 markov chain monte carlo simulation zhang et al 2018 and so on among these methods copula is a robust uncertainty assessment tool which maintains spatial and temporal dependence characteristics of the observed and simulated datasets aghakouchak et al 2010 moazami et al 2014 copula functions in simulation of nonlinear dependence structures and model uncertainty is getting broader attention in hydrological studies hao and singh 2016 zengchao and vijay 2020 these functions form the joint multivariate probability distribution of multiple variables using their marginal probability distribution sungur and nelson 2006 application of copulas in compound flood probability and coastal flood risk assessment has been increased in recent years several studies e g zellou and rahali 2019 xu et al 2014 lian et al 2013 investigated the compound flood risk assessment with the dependence between high tide event and heavy rainfall using copulas in a low gradient coastal region the flood transition zone bilskie and hagen 2018 i e tidal and non tidal regime can be found by the propagation of high tide in low elevated places the multivariate copulas maintain the spatial dependence structure of multiple error factors which can be applied to establish bias correction inundation model in flood transition zone therefore the copulas can be engaged in enhancement of the accuracy of coastal urban flood modeling didier et al 2019 sadegh et al 2018 as it is discussed above the key mechanism of coastal urban flood relies on rainfall runoff and tidal surge interaction in this regard the role of tides in coastal urban flood is still poorly understood the main goal of this study is to capture the knowledge gaps for understanding the dynamic mechanism of compound flooding events through development of an integrated modeling framework while the coastal hydrodynamic model or storm surge model is often selected as the base model the rainfall runoff process would be ignored which results in appearance of considerable uncertainty in modeling thus this study offers a holistic and unique approach for modeling which links a hydrological model with a coastal hydrodynamic model accordingly a two way coupled storm surge wave model delft3d and swan and hydrologic model swmm is established the influence of the surge propagation characteristics timing and phase of tidal surge is examined in drainage system of chittagong city to address the issues of the hybrid modeling framework inherent uncertainty this study also utilized a multivariate copula model in the next section critical features of chittagong city as the main study area are described then the proposed compound modeling framework is discussed and all components of the models are presented in section 3 the calibration and validation results of the compound modeling and a multivariate copula are presented in section 4 finally the tidal surge and rainfall runoff interaction results are analyzed in section 5 2 study area historical floods in chittagong city are compelling examples of compound flooding events in urbanized coastal regions and thus selected as the study case the city located at southeastern part of bangladesh coast which is the most vulnerable place of storm tidal surge mullick et al 2019 the main chittagong catchment has the area of about 44 19 km2 where about 230 000 reside in this basin the long term historical average of rainfall is about 3 000 mm year and average temperature is 25 c in chittagong the drainage system of chittagong city comprises of lined channels and natural waterways which accumulate and carry the most of rainfall runoff from upstream and backwater flow from adjacent tidal karnafuli river and bay of bengal fig 1 no sluice gates detention ponds or other flood controlling structures exist in the current system the drainage system has no barrier for the frequent nuisance flooding during high tide or spring tide events from adjacent tidal karnafuli river and bay of bengal three tributaries of karnafuli river including khal no 10 chaktai khal and mohesh khal drain out the rainfall runoff from the city the tide range of the adjacent karnafuli river varies between 4 m and 6 m during a year here we focused more on the tidal affected drainage systems mullick et al 2019 reported that it is less likely that this coastal city is susceptible to coastal flood for the parts with elevation greater than 9 5 m therefore the parts of the chittagong city with higher elevations above 9 5 m were not included in our analysis the coastal urban floods in this city are mainly influenced by the coastal forcing and topography of the adjacent chittagong coast high tide amplitude 4 6 m along with the mild coastal slope intensifies the propagation of the storm surge the tides in chittagong coast are semi diurnal with noticeable variation of m2 harmonic constituents coastal flood frequency and damages in chittagong city have been exacerbated by unregulated urbanization happened in recent years the chittagong coast has experienced the highest number of tropical cyclones in bangladesh coast including cyclone 1991 which resulted in death of 140 000 people alam and dominey howes 2015 during 2013 14 this city experienced about 13 flood events with inundation depths ranging from 0 13 to 0 3 m and the inundation lasts for up to 48 h akter et al 2017 although cyclones may hit other parts of bangladesh coast because the bengal bay has a funnel shape at its head the surges usually accumulate near the chittagong coast hussain et al 2017 in situ hydrographic records have proven that the chittagong coast has the second highest slr 9 47 mm year in the northern indian ocean over the last few decades carvalho and wang 2019 all in all the chittagong city is a compelling test bed for the investigation of the underlying mechanism in compound urban coastal flooding 3 methodology here the modeling has been done in three stages during the first stage a coupled coastal hydrodynamic model delft3d and swan is developed to obtain the downstream tidal boundary conditions including total water level from storm tidal surge wave tide and astronomic tide stage i outputs are then used as the main inputs to force hydrological modeling swmm at the stage ii finally during the stage iii a copula based model is developed to reduce the uncertainty of the modeling process by adjusting the biases from modeling outputs the schematic of integrated framework is presented in fig 2 3 1 storm surge modeling at the first stage the storm surge model for this study should be coupled with a wave flow modeling system for this purpose delft3d flow and swan are selected and coupled in this study the storm tracks cyclone mora and 1991 selected area for storm surge modeling deft3d grids and land use classifications are shown in fig 3 the cyclone track was obtained from international best track archive for climate stewardship ibtracs https www ncdc noaa gov ibtracs and landuse data was obtained from the analysis carried by mullick et al 2019 3 1 1 tide modeling in this research delft3d flow model computes tide and storm surge heights resulted from meteorological forcing i e wind and pressure the hydrodynamic module of delft3d solves the 2d depth averaged or the 3d nonlinear shallow water equations hydraulics 2014 delft3d rgfgrid a boundary fitted grid generation tool is used to generate structured grids for the hydrodynamic module grids were further refined from spline to the aspect ratio below five fig 3 the total number of generated grid cells for this study is 56 637 which cover an area of about 251 000 km2 of the study region the finer resolution grids were assigned over the nearshore and continental shelf resolution of 0 5 1 km to improve the skill of the hydrodynamic modeling the coarser resolution grids were applied at deep sea with maximum 6 km resolution the bathymetry representation for the region was enhanced by merging satellite images derived from gebco bathymetry hydrographic charts of bangladesh navy and mongla port authority the manning s roughness coefficient n varies spatially and they are assigned based on different land cover types and water depth recommended by deb and ferreira 2016 and krien et al 2017 due to the presence of mangrove forests and varieties of vegetation types along the coastal region land cover map from cci lc 2017 are used the whole domain of delft3d flow was forced by harmonic constituents at 16 tide stations krien et al 2016 found 12 dominant harmonic constituents t2 k1 k2 m2 n2 o1 p1 q1 s2 2n2 nu2 and mu2 in the northern bay of bengal and those constituents are used to force the delft3d flow moreover according to rose and bhaskaran 2017 recommendations each station was additionally forced by shallow water and long period harmonic constituents 3 1 2 coupled wave flow modeling to account for the non linear interactions between tides waves atmospheric forcing during storm surges this study couple the hydrodynamic simulation of delft3d with the swan model the currents are adopted from hydrodynamic model and wave characteristics in terms of significant wave height swh then they are passed to delft3d and swan models to get the radiation stresses radiation stresses further produce the wave forcing for the total water level of storm surge the swan model with coupling intervals of 30 min is used for wave flow coupling swan model is implemented using 36 directional and 24 frequency bins to consider the wave propagation in all directions the logarithmic frequency bins range from 0 05 to 1 hz with an angular resolution of 10 wave growth mechanism based on komen et al 1984 is applied to simulate wind waves the quadruplet s discrete interaction approximation was employed to account for the non linear wave wave interactions due to spatial variation of the roughness length near shore the bottom friction is formulated using 0 05 m bottom roughness length scale suggested by madsen et al 1988 thus the wave conditions are estimated using swh and significant wave period to represent the wave characteristics for the shallow water depth induced wave breaking is determined using the breaking index γ 0 73 as per battjes and janssen 1978 spectral model the wave boundary conditions were computed from wave spectra of the wavewatch iii ww3 model and forced with three hour interval wave datasets which further are reanalyzed and interpolated at a 30 min interval to perform hindcasting integral wave parameters i e swh mean wave period peak wave direction are analyzed using matlab from ww3 model results the deep water wave boundary located at the southern open sea is used to enter the wave energy into computational domain finally the coupled wave flow model is developed to simulate the storm surge during cyclone 1991 and mora more information about development and coupling of this model is presented in tanim and akter 2019 3 1 3 wind model representation of the cyclone wind profile is the key element in order to represent accurate storm surge the meteorological forces wind velocity and pressure are modeled using a parametric cyclone model to represent the cyclone generated forcing over coastal water based on holland et al 2010 the use of six hour intervals are considered for cyclone track information from international best track archive the asymmetry of the cyclone wind field was imposed based on the vickery and wadhera 2008 relationship between radius of maximum wind rmw and central pressure at cyclone eye the cyclone track consists of six hour interval cyclone wind speed and pressure which are further disaggregated into 15 min intervals in order to update the cyclone position for swan and delft3d flow model coupling the wind drag force was formulated following wu 1982 1 f d 1 2875 10 3 f o r u 10 7 5 m s 0 8 0 065 u 10 10 3 f o r u 10 7 5 m s where f d is the drag coefficient and u 10 is the wind velocity at 10 m above the ground surface in delft3d model the parametric holland model was incorporated using delft dashboard a matlab toolbox a 60 50 dimension spider grids are developed to represent the spatial pattern of cyclone wind and pressure 3 2 pluvial flood modeling swmm model is selected in this study to simulate the rainfall runoff process and 1 d storm drainage modeling during the flooding events the physical components of swmm such as subcatchments and drainage systems were sketched and prepared for modeling using arcgis the shuttle radar topography mission srtm 30 m resolution digital elevation model dem maps are then analyzed using arc gis v10 1 here the hec geohms terrain processing tool is used to delineate the total of 18 sub catchments about 78 21 of the study area is developed fig 2 hence curve number would be an appropriate method for rainfall runoff modeling ghodsi et al 2020 curve numbers for the study area are derived based on 10 m resolution sentinel 2 satellite imagery information mullick et al 2019 the satellite images are classified into seven land classes developed area sand water body crop land low density vegetation high density vegetation and grassland the information regarding soil type are collected from chittagong development authority cda soil survey 2006 the hydrologic soil group are determined based on the soil infiltration rate the land use information and the hydrologic group of the soil are used to identify the appropriate soil conservation service scs curve number for each pixel considering normal antecedent condition mishra and singh 2003 then the modified scs equation eq 2 was used to estimate the curve numbers in each subcatchment 2 c n a w i 1 i n c n i a i i 1 i n a i where cnaw is the area weighted average curve number for each subcatchment aw cni is the curve number for each land use and soil group i and ai is the total area of each land use type the drainage network existing drainage layout from cda was transferred from arcgis to the swmm model total of 152 transects conduits irregular channel cross section and 136 junction nodes are generated in swmm model to represent the drainage network seven outlets are identified along the karnaphuli river and one outlet is placed at the bay of bengal to allow the surge propagation backwater effect is simulated using the dynamic wave routing method using 30 sec time steps meteorological information such as rainfall wind speed evaporation temperature and humidity was gathered in 3 hour intervals from the only available meteorological station in this region called potenga fig 1 3 2 1 historical coastal urban flood events two tropical cyclones cyclone mora and 1991 were selected in this study to examine the storm surge impacts table 1 the cyclone mora was a category 1 cyclone and cyclone 1991 was category 5 in saffir simpson scale during those cyclone events a 3 hour interval rainfall time series was used for swmm model simulation the models are calibrated and validated just for the cyclone mora later different model scenarios table 2 were generated to obtain rainfall runoff and surge interactions the surge arrival time varies for different scenarios with the changes of 2 hour leads lags from cyclone 1991 the lagging or leading surge arrival time causes sets of new types of interactions between surge and tidal phases consequently the tide surge interaction produces different surge height magnitude that can be assigned as tide phase shifting during the coastal urban flood 3 3 copula joint probability estimation the one way coupling system applied in this study is subjected to errors from boundary conditions this error can be reduced by adjusting biases from observed data using copula functions the sklar s theorem interprets there exist a function copula c that links multivariate distribution g to marginal distributions of random variables fi xi for a d dimensional copula the multivariate distribution is expressed as eq 3 nelsen 2006 3 g x c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f d x d x x 1 x n d r d from the distribution copulas can be constructed as eq 4 4 c u g f 1 1 u 1 f d d u d u u 1 u d 0 1 d and c 0 1 d 0 1 multivariate copula simulates the spatial dependence structure among variables that have independent choice of marginal distribution function aghakouchak et al 2010 copula function has been often used for uncertainty evaluation where uncertainty can be expressed by the probability distribution of the variable a multivariate copula has been utilized in this study where the necessary steps are presented as follows i the biases have been identified between comparing the modeling output results and observed water depth from three stream gauges coastal urban flood information during mora is used for adjusting the model outputs and bias correction about 80 of the dataset has been used to train and calibrate the copula model while the remaining 20 data is employed to evaluate the performance of copula model ii the difference between observed xo and simulated depth xs at each gauge is considered as observed biases εo eq 5 the value of observed bias is obtained during mora for each gauge i separately 5 ε o i 1 n x o i x s i n where n is the number of observations iii the observed biases at each gauge are fitted to their marginal distribution the best fit probability distributions for each observed ensemble of biases are identified using the anderson darling goodness of fit test to check the statistical significance of the fitted distribution at 5 significance level normal distribution is found as the best marginal distribution for observed biases with negligible tail dependence then the cumulative distribution functions cdfs of the biases are computed for each gauge iv four different multivariate copula functions gaussian aghakouchak et al 2010 žežula 2009 2 t copula demarta and mcneil 2005 clayton mcneil 2008 and frank hofert and mächler 2011 liebscher 2008 have been tested here to find the best fit the aic and bic tests are used to find the best fit copula function based on generated cdfs in the previous step table 3 shows the results of aic and bic for four different multivariate copula functions based on this table n dimensional multivariate gaussian copula is selected as the best fit with the lowest aic and bic value while the dimensionality n is 3 which is represented by biases at each three gauges copula models the spatial dependence structure of bias values among different gauges v since the biases at each stream gauge stations are assumed as variables the depth obtained at tidal and non tidal regimes can be treated separately in copula model the gaussian copula is used to generate 1 000 random ensemble samples for each variable biases at three gauges vi the inverses cdfs of randomly generated ensembled are obtained after generating random datasets outliers are detected and removed using mahalanobis distance de maesschalck et al 2000 vii the simulated biases εo are imposed based on flood correlation section 3 4 for identifying the nodes nature tidal or non tidal nodes finally the necessary bias adjustments have been applied on the swmm simulated inundation depths as follows 6 x b a i x s i ε s where x b a i is a bias adjusted depth m at ith stream gauge and x s i is the swmm simulated depth m at ith stream gauge 3 4 flood correlation in order to identify if the coastal urban flood nature is attributed to the fluvial or tidal flooding spearman rank correlation is estimated at each node the spearman rank correlation is a nonparametric indicator which determines if the variable is a monotone function of another variable or not zar 1972 let rx and ry being the rank of the two measurements of variable x and y respectively the spearman rank correlation ρ can be calculated as follows 7 ρ c o v r x r y σ r x σ r y where c o v r x r y indicates the covariance of the rank variables the standard deviations of the variables are σ r x and σ r y the correlation between the two varies between 1 to 1 where 0 indicates no correlation negative and positive values show the negative or positive correlation between variables in order to obtain ρ the inundation depth should be calculated for two different conditions 1 the model is simulated without the tidal curve and 2 the meteorological conditions are excluded and tide curve is used to obtain the inundation depth from tidal flooding the first condition provides inundation depth for pluvial flooding and the second one simulates the coastal flooding from high tide or storm surge 4 results 4 1 model calibration and validation first the hydrologic model should be calibrated based on streamgauge measurements at g1 g2 and g3 the streamgauges g1 and g3 measure tidal flow whereas the streamgauge g2 has non tidal nature the calibration is performed in two stages 1 considering subcatchment width and curve number as calibration parameters and 2 developing a copula model for bias correction the subcatchment parameters are tuned first to achieve a closest fit to the observed dataset then the residual errors should be diminished by the copula model this model is developed based on bias errors obtained from the difference between simulated and observed water level the mean bias will be added to or subtracted from the simulated water level from stage 1 depends if the node has flash or tidal flood nature 4 1 1 copula simulation and bias correction the cdf and pdf of the developed multivariate gaussian copula are shown in fig 4 the pdf and cdf of gaussian copula using randomly generated sample size of 1 000 are shown in fig 4 the cdf was obtained in three gauges showed higher pdf in tidal zone g1 and g3 than other pairs g1 and g2 g2 and g3 the simulation band was adjusted for 95 confidence interval of observed datasets to determine the bias adjusted water level it is clear that from fig 5 the systematic errors in tidal gauges g1 and g3 are more efficiently corrected in comparison to the non tidal gauge g2 the simulated water level at the g3 which is the result of compound flood model indicates lower value than the measured water level fig 5 the g3 gauge is relatively closer to the watershed outlet compared to the other gauges particularly the flood peak was underestimated in compound flood model inclusion of the bias correction module copula model compensates for the errors from the swmm model to improve the results another option could be using a two way coupling technique where the discharge information between both swmm and delft3d model can be exchanged at the regular intervals however the major advantage of using copula model is the simplicity of work minimizing computational time needed for rapid forecasts during the flooding and avoiding the computational complexity caused by higher precision integration 4 1 2 storm surge model validation the storm surge model is validated for the stream gauge g4 during cyclone mora fig 6 a the simulated surge height is affected by tidal influences and small disturbances from the atmospheric forcings about 7 29 percent bias was observed from the gauge measurement which indicates the slight overestimation of 0 35 m surge height the timing and maximum surge height during the cyclone 1991 were further used for validation using the study deb and ferreira 2016 dube et al 2009 fig 6b the maximum surge height was recorded about 4 82 m during the cyclone whereas this number is estimated about 4 7 m and 5 2 m by dube et al 2009 and deb and ferreira 2016 respectively the timing of the peak surge is consistent with deb and ferreira 2016 results 4 1 3 statistical analysis of results in order to evaluate the performance of the coastal urban flood model three statistical tests are performed coefficient of determination r2 percent bias pbias root mean square error rmse table 4 summarizes the model performance assessment during the calibration and validation periods to estimate the storm surge height calibrated model developed by tanim and akter 2019 was used this model is also validated based on information from station g4 during the cyclone mora fig 6a the rmse of the storm surge height estimated about 0 24 m whereas the r2 is about 0 90 the rmse of the simulated water level from bias corrected hydrologic model is about 0 09 0 17 m the copula model 4 6 24 3 improved the predicted inundation depth for biased corrected results from the non corrected models the r2 value 0 95 0 98 at the tidal stream gauges of g1 and g3 represented a reasonable tie with the observed water level on the other hand the non tidal stream gauge s g3 r2 value is estimated about 0 78 to 0 81 the r2 values verify the dependence structure was maintained by the use of multivariate copula in tidal and non tidal nodes the tidal water level data are normally distributed and as the tide shows a harmonic behavior however the water level fluctuations in non tidal gauges has relatively random behavior and this in order to better train the copula model further gauge measurements are required unfortunately there is just one non tidal streamgauge located in the study area and information from this gauge is available thus the copula parameters i e kendall s tau and spearman s rho might pose slight discrepancies in simulated water level 4 2 storm surge simulation to evaluate the performance of the modeling framework the model is used to simulate the storm surge and flood during the cyclone mora and cyclone 1991 the surge peak at chittagong coast was observed about 1 5 2 m during the cyclone mora and 4 4 5 m during cyclone 1991 fig 7 the surge was amassed near the chittagong coast fig 7a and 7b at its landfall location and peak surge duration lasted for about 2 h during cyclone mora and 4 5 h during cyclone 1991 the encircled bay shape near the coast accumulates the surges it is expected that category 5 storms cyclone 1991 comes with greater flood extent and higher surge height fig 7a and b thereby the coastal flood in that cyclone is more intense and the change of tide phase is more prominent the maximum surge height was obtained when the cyclonic force superimposed with the low tide i e the baseline scenario fig 7a the strong wind over the shallow water had increased the surge height the wind wave and elevated water level adjacent to the coast led to coastal flooding according to the horsburgh and wilson 2007 for a tidal surge the surge height is inversely related to the water depth so the surge height during low tides would be higher than the surge height when wind wave coincides with high tide fig 7b the landfall of cyclone mora occurred during the transition phase of high to low tide after the surge peak the immediate low tide phase was not fully developed due to the dropping tide level fig 7b but the landfall of cyclone 1991 was occurred during low tide and caused an extreme flood however the tide surge interaction is one reason which attributes to the maximum surge levels since the wind speed intensity and track of each cyclone can vary considerably they can also produce spatially varied surge maxima in different places and times 4 3 tidal surge and rainfall interaction varying surge arrival time technique is used here for measuring the effect of tide phase shifting on surge height which can produce the tide surge interactions at all possible magnitudes fig 8 a represents the surge height with seven different flood scenarios at the outlet location g4 the magnitude of the surge height was found at it maximum level 4 08 4 8 m in three flood scenarios base 6 h lag and 6 h lead scenarios it is prominent that when high low tide coincides with storm surge the water level would reach to its maximum level this surge hydrograph shape of the northern bay of bengal can better explain the tide surge interactions antony and unnikrishnan 2013 shallow bathymetry adjacent to chittagong coast largely reduces the wave height thus the storm surge process is mainly governed by the tide surge interaction the bathymetric configuration of nearshore amplifies the surge height in tide dominated bay horsburgh and wilson 2007 broad continental shelf of the northern bay of bengal has significant contribution to the formation and magnitude of the tidal surge during high tide phase 6 h lag the surge propagation is faster than the low tide phase base mainly due to relatively smaller bottom friction at high tide and it generates higher phase speed by rise of the water level hussain and tajima 2017 therefore the effects of the bottom friction on the water column during surge propagation in high tide are less in comparison to lower water levels during low tide conditions since the effects of the bottom friction are less the water column can move faster a tropical cyclone brings enormous rainfall to the coast during the cyclone 1991 the peak rainfall occurred 5 h later than the surge peak fig 8 consequently at first the coastal flood was dominated by the effect of storm surge propagation then heavy rainfall contributed to the compound coastal urban flood and the event became more intense as it is shown in table 5 the base scenario represents the most intense flooding condition table 5 the tropical cyclone induced rainfall follows a wavelike diurnal cycle and two extreme rainfalls gaona et al 2018 hence the tc rainfall is highly varied in both temporal and spatial extent two tropical cyclone induced rainfall extremes can be happened in about 18 h difference gaona and villarini 2018 two rainfall peaks was recorded at 17 00 utc apr 29 and 1 00 utc apr 30 which indicates the diurnal rainfall peaks the overflowed nodes in drainage system and time duration of overflows are shows in fig 9 for a total of 72 h flood simulation the flood response is strongly correlated with tide phase and rainfall intensity the temporal correlation of rainfall intensity and surge peak mostly dominates the intensity of compound flood given the ensemble of model scenarios the number of overflow nodes depends on the tide phase and flood duration fig 9 the maximum inundated nodes were found when the cyclone made landfall with low baseline scenario or high tide phase baseline scenario and 6 h lead lag when the surge height was found maximum the situation can be even staggered if the peak rainfall coincides with the high tide i e 6 h lag scenario when the surge arrives during the high tide phase the flood water cannot drain out because of the high water level at the downstream the duration of surge peak offers a considerable effect on flood duration for flood scenarios 4 h lag 2 h lag and 2 h lead the peak surge durations are around 4 4 5 h and the surge height were estimated about 3 06 3 6 m table 5 when surge interacts with the dropping phase of low tide 2 h lag the surge propagation speed is relatively slower than the rising phase of high tide 4 h lead consequently in slower case 2 h lag the flood has become relatively stable it is also notable that the duration of overflow at nodes for scenarios 2 h lag and 2 h lead are identical fig 9 in both scenarios the timing and peak of surge curves represent similar characteristics fig 9a the least number of nodes were inundated for flood scenario of 4 h lead fig 9 the generated surge peak for this flood scenario coincided with the high tide and no other surge peak were observed hence this scenario has the least number of inundated nodes similarly the inundated nodes were reduced for the flood scenario of 6 h lead in other words when the surge arrival time shifts by a 6 h the interaction between rainfall and surge become stronger and their peaks are at the highest level consequently the number of inundated nodes were reduced by 7 56 in comparison to the baseline scenario however during surge peak of flood scenario with 4 h lead the tide range was obtained 5 6 m which is similar to the high tide event without storm surge in the chittagong coast the tide range amplifies up to 6 m during june july the coincidence of high tide storm surge and rainfall peak can result in extreme coastal urban flood risk pirazzoli et al 2006 thus a high tidal event which is accompanied by an intense precipitation event can form extreme flood in the city the maximum high tide event usually occurs during spring high tide 4 4 flood correlation the outcome of the spearman rank correlation confirmed that the coastal urban flood has compound flood nature contribution from both rainfall runoff and tide the rainfall is the prime factor for urban coastal flooding as for flash flooding it shows ρ 0 12 1 00 fig 10 a about 83 nodes have ρ value above 0 75 for flash flood mostly those nodes are located at the upstream part of the study area the ρ value for tidal flood was obtained between 0 29 and 0 99 with average of 0 51 which indicates that the nature of extreme flood events of the city has secondary sources from tidal effect about 33 of the drainage nodes demonstrated strong correlation ρ value 0 75 with tidal flood apparently in a particular node for tidal flood with the increase of ρ value the flood correlation was decreased with flash flood the distribution of those nodes illustrated in fig 10b and showed the downstream part of the drainage system has significant tidal effect for tidal flood the ρ value increases from upstream to downstream this followed the tidal amplitude which has highest magnitude at outlet that gradually reduced with the inland distance the tropical cyclone induced rainfall has significant rainfall variation with gradual decreasing pattern with the increased distance from coast knight and davis 2007 the surge or tidal flood dominated nodes located near 2 5 km from the adjacent karnafuli river and bay of bengal during passage of tropical cyclone the urbanization of the cities is also responsible for heterogeneous nature of flooding in those nodes apart from the downstream part of the drainage system 5 nodes in the inner part fig 10b showed moderate correlation ρ value 0 5 with tidal flood due to low elevation of drain although the casualties of tropical cyclones frequently attributed to storm surge the flood correlation in this study shows the tropical induced rainfall is mainly responsible 4 5 spatial change of flood 4 5 1 flood duration the spatial changes of flood duration and depth with different flood scenarios are investigated in this section from the swmm simulation it was obtained that the mean flood duration of baseline scenario was 12 55 h fig 11 a about 16 nodes were inundated for 25 37 h in total 3 days flood event simulation when the tide phase was led by 2 h from low tide 2 h lead 92 nodes showed 0 18 0 6 h flood duration difference with respect to baseline scenario δd fig 11b similarly when the tide phase was led by 4 h the mean δd was obtained 0 974 h fig 11c further the tide phase was advanced 6 h from low tide phase i e 6 h lead flood scenario had mean of δd about 1 52 h fig 11d the flood duration was decreased for the leading tide phase due to the rainfall amount was low at those flood scenarios even after the surge peak was 3 06 3 6 m when tide phase was lagged by 2 h and 4 h the mean δd was increased by 1 75 and 1 95 h respectively two factors are responsible to increase the flood duration the surge peak duration for flood scenario 2 h lag and 4 h lag was 4 4 5 h and the maximum rainfall also occurs close to the peak surge period consequently the flood duration was increased in those cases maximum mean δd of 2 42 h was observed in flood scenario 6 h lag in this scenario the peak surge and peak rainfall occurred simultaneously that create most durable flood scenario however in some nodes for the flood scenario 2 and 4 h lag has longer inundation period than 6 h lag fig 11e and 11f this is caused by the inadequate drainage capacity and low elevation of those nodes subsequently the water logging period also increases 4 5 2 flood depth the relation between tide phase shift and compound flood depth as well as the relative change of inundation depth with respect to baseline scenario δh is shown in fig 12 based on the flood duration and flood depth the flood intensity was classified in three classes including high moderate and low table 5 the simulated maximum inundation depth was reached up to 3 76 m during cyclone 1991 fig 12a about 84 of total nodes were inundated with flood depth 0 31 0 6 m the inundation depth of baseline scenario was found 0 31 3 76 m the inundation depth was relatively high near outfall as well as in some low gradient nodes at the upstream part of the study area the elevation near riverbank is relatively high due to hilly terrain but the center of the city is relatively low which is mainly in control for long inundation period in the center of city about 80 nodes have minor response δh between 0 14 to 0 0 with change of the tide phase in different flood scenarios and 20 nodes rapidly response with changing the tide phase those nodes are tidal in nature and have higher spearman correlations with tidal flood when tide phase was led from surge peak the inundation depth was reduced in tidal nodes with δh ranging from 0 54 to 0 15 marked with yellow nodes in fig 12e and 12 g besides with lag of tide phase the flood depth was increased in tidal nodes δh between 0 01 and 0 24 marked with dark blue nodes in fig 12e and 12 g when storm surge and extreme precipitation occurs in succession 2 h 4 h and 6 h lead times the δh was not significantly changed rather the flood depth was reduced on average about 0 05 m the flood scenario 2 h lead and 4 h lag typically result in the lowest number of inundation nodes but when storm surge and extreme precipitation occurs simultaneously e g 6 h lag the compound flood depth even exceeds baseline scenario the δh was increased by 0 01 0 24 m in 5 nodes while on average the flood depth was increased by 0 1 m in compare to baseline scenario fig 12g when the high tide propagates through the drainage network it delays the runoff disposal to the adjacent karnafuli river consequently the flood duration and depth were increased and the flood also extended in the upstream part of catchment area fig 12a and 12 g when the surge propagates the karnafuli river adjacent coast was faster inundated before inundated in the upstream part of the catchment however a 2d inundation model is more appropriate to detect the δh rather than a 1d swmm model if the invert elevation of a node is located below the high tide elevation the drainage system is more susceptible to tidal flood these nodes which represent the highest inundation depth due to tidal flood can reduce the drainage capacity even before the runoff from rainfall propagates through the drain the phenomena which is so called nuisance flooding moftakhari et al 2018 moreover in most cases the downstream drainage section is inadequate to carry the compound flood runoff nevertheless all nodes accounted in this study was not tidal nodes the alarming slr may extend the flood transition zones particularly with the increase of tidal nodes about 17 nodes of the study area have elevation below high tide level therefore with increasing slr a significant portion of the city can be submerged 5 conclusions and discussions this study highlights a hybrid modeling process of compound flood to investigate rainfall runoff and storm tidal surge interactions since complex characteristics of hydraulics and hydrologic processes in coastal urban areas cannot be represented and resolved by single modeling framework this study employed a compound flood model using a hydrologic model swmm as the base model coupled with a coastal hydrodynamic model delft3d the multivariate gaussian copula function is used to represent the uncertainty of model outputs and indicated a reasonable performance to characterize the systematic errors of one way coupling to enhance the calibration of compound flood model the tide phase shifts in coastal urban flood has pronounced effect on flood duration and depth in this study area a compound flood is more intense when peak rainfall and surge peak occur simultaneously rather than in succession when storm surge make landfall in high low tide the surge height reaches at maximum level consequently mean flood duration and depth can be increased by 2 5 h and 0 0 24 m respectively when the storm surge superimposes in a transition phase between high low tide 2 4 h before low high tide the compound flood is more durable as longer surge peak duration 4 4 5 h may occur again the highest time interval between rainfall peak and surge peak make the compound flood less intense and in this case the inundated nodes can be decreased by 7 59 8 9 analyzing coastal urban flood nature requires a better understanding of the main drivers and nature of flood the spearman correlation can be used to identify tidal nodes the coastal urban flood management can benefit from the proper identification of flood correlation with rainfall runoff or tide particularly for designing the urban drainage system one major limitation in different statistical approaches is ignoring the storm surge probability during the low tide surge interaction current models result show high probability of extreme water level when surge arrives during low tide using coastal hydrodynamic model the physical process of surge amplification was considered more appropriately in this study and showed that the non linear tide surge interactions can result in higher surge height and more intense flood during rising low and high tide phase current model framework can be improved using two way coupling techniques where the discharge information between both swmm and delft3d model can be exchanged at regular intervals but the main advantage of using this copula model is the minimizing computational time needed for rapid forecasts during the flooding and avoiding the computational complexity despite those achievements still discrepancies present in several model formulation steps accordingly in future study the hybrid modeling can be improved as follows 1 the copula uncertainty model applied in this study is subject to errors because the limited number of gauges there should be more gauges in particularly tide affected drainage system to characterize the systematic errors as the compound flood probability is high in those drains 2 the coastal hydrodynamic model domain can be extended in drainage network in order to properly account surge decay moreover a 2d hydrologic model or inundation model is more appropriate to represent the compound flood depth 3 the hydrologic model swmm uses a timeseries format for the rainfall input also for this study area the rainfall data are gathered in 3 hr intervals availability of better rainfall measurement and inputs such as radar doppler information can potentially improve the proficiency of rainfall runoff model outputs 4 the study area is 30 and 85 km away from the landfall location of cyclone 1991 and mora respectively although this distance is negligible as the maximum surge height usually produce in area of maximum wind radius the surge height could be even more in case a cyclone made landfall in the study area to meet such purpose synthetic cyclone track can be generated from hurricane weather forecasting hwrf model 5 the 6 hr lead scenario represents that the peak rainfall has arrived before surge peak and the baseline scenario shows the peak rainfall has occurred after arrival of the surge peak it is suggested to consider intensity duration frequency curve of tropical cyclone induced rainfalls and the effect of timing of rainfall peak arrival before or after the peak surge on compound flood intensity in the future studies during a compound flood still the biggest threat to chittagong city is intense precipitation strong correlation of tidal flood was also observed which indicates current sea level has already posed an alarming risk for the compound flood spearman correlation can be used to identify the flood transition zone indicates most of the nodes are rainfall runoff dominated and the tidal nodes are primarily located in low gradient region having invert elevation below high tide level high tide or surge height put additional risk to dispose rainfall runoff by reducing the drainage capacity in tidal nodes it is highly recommended to establish sluicegate at each outfall with adequate pumping facility however to construct such flood control structures not the only solution because without proper controlling the outfall sluice will not

4825,the formation of urban coastal flooding is mainly ruled by the interaction between rainfall runoff and storm surge this study aims to advance the understanding of coastal urban flood mechanism by developing an integrated modeling and multivariate analysis framework which involves a hydrologic model storm water management model swmm as the core model coupled with a coastal hydrodynamic model delft3d the uncertainty associated with the flood depth prediction by integrated models is analyzed using the multivariate gaussian copula the performance of the integrated modeling framework is evaluated for the chittagong city of bangladesh which has experienced extreme and frequent coastal urban floods results from modeling indicate that changes in the tidal phase of coastal urban flooding alter the flood s duration and depth the intensity of compound flooding is higher for the co occurrence of rainfall and surge peaks than the occurrence of both events in succession the average flood duration and depth can be increased by about 2 5 h and 0 24 m respectively during compound events when the storm surge occurs during the transition phase between high low tides 2 4 h before peak low high tide the duration of flood extends due to longer surge duration 4 4 5 h finally the multivariate gaussian copula model adjusts the integrated modeling outputs and enhances the skill to predict the inundation depth by 4 6 24 3 the findings of this study are critical for a better understanding of coastal urban flood processes and enhancing the informed decision making for emergency management and planning in low lying coastal regions keywords coastal urban flood integrated modeling framework copula functions multivariate probability compound flooding 1 introduction coastal floods and their respective damage are anticipated to be increased during the next decades hinkel et al 2014 the total number of category 4 and 5 hurricanes in north indian ocean had been increased by about 138 during 1986 1995 to 1996 2005 klotzbach 2006 estimated damage of tropical cyclones tcs shows a rising trend particularly where the tcs wind speed is more than 0 15 ms 1 yr elsner et al 2008 while the coastal population and developments are growing larger coastal cities will be much exposed to the more frequent and intense floods de sherbinin et al 2007 just in 2005 the losses from flooding events around the world was estimated about us 6 billion this number is projected to be about us 52 billion by 2050 hallegatte et al 2013 when a tc makes landfall it initiates tidal surges and brings heavy rainfalls which in turn can causes a compound flooding event in coastal regions tcs in the bay of bengal bring heavy rainfalls about 2 500 5 000 mm yr which are mainly accumulated over the coastal region of the bangladesh and india gaona et al 2018 in this region approximately 9 5 of annual rainfall is originated from the tropical cyclones prat and nelson 2013 hence the coastal flood often occurs in presence of combined storm surges and heavy rainfalls referred as compound flooding particularly more in urban areas compound events are formed by combination of multiple climate drivers where in many cases these extreme events poses overwhelming environmental risks exceeding the natural coping capacity zscheischler et al 2020 compound flood can be formed by a single meteorological event such as a tropical cyclone and extreme precipitation or during successive meteorological events silva araya et al 2018 bacopoulos et al 2016 2009 bilskie and hagen 2018 santiago collazo et al 2019 for example prolonged precipitation events due to formation of a low pressure system during high tide storm surge events can cause compound floods as well serafin et al 2019 the key mechanism of compound flood underlines the rainfall runoff and storm tidal surge interaction the compound flood is often more intense in low gradient coastal areas located in adjacent to tidal rivers or regions which are experiencing significant sea level rise slr comer et al 2017 several factors are involved in formation and intensification of a coastal urban flood such as urbanization climate change and sea level rise one driver is the high imperviousness of urban watersheds which results in shorter runoff response time and higher peak flows shahapure et al 2010 slr is an emerging threat for increasing the incidents of compound flooding in coastal regions bilskie et al 2019 2016 passeri et al 2015 moftakhari et al 2019 the persistence emission of greenhouse gasses and growth of human activities may result in 1 m of slr by 2100 kopp et al 2014 the slr eliminates the freeboard between flood stage and high tide datum vandenberg rodes et al 2016 in low level and low gradient coastal systems depending on topography and bathymetry the system can be tide dominated wave dominated or often a mixed dynamic between high tides and waves can be seen as dominated behavior for the surge modulation critical space and time scales depends on tidal surge amplitude and phase shift with tide horsburgh and wilson 2007 when high tide or tidal surge propagates through the drainage system it delays the drainage of runoff the timing of surge propagation controls the coastal flood duration as the higher water level at drainage outfall can extend the flood duration bunya et al 2010 it is imperative to more precisely investigate and model the underlying physical process of multiple flood drivers including tides waves river discharge and local rainfall in order to enhance our understanding of coastal urban flooding individual and disconnected modeling of flooding events as fluvial pluvial coastal floods can be performed by use of hydrologic or hydrodynamic models however multivariate analysis of coastal urban flood and representation of rainfall runoff and tidal surge interactions calls for more integrated and holistic modeling frameworks 1 1 integrated modeling of rainfall runoff and storm surge the simulation of joint impacts of rainfall runoff and storm surge requires development of a coupled modeling framework mainly by integrating a hydrologic or hydrodynamic model as the base model with a coastal inundation model bacopoulos et al 2016 2009 bakhtyar et al 2020 bilskie and hagen 2018 santiago collazo et al 2019 ye et al 2020 using a single coastal inundation model often oversimplifies the coastal riverine interactions due to the coarse modeling grids and neglects the inland flood contribution this issue can be potentially solved by combining coastal hydrodynamic models e g sea lake and overland surges from hurricanes slosh glahn et al 2009 semi implicit cross scale hydroscience integrated system model schism zhang et al 2020

l 2016 for example karamouz et al 2015 developed an integrated modeling system using a hydraulic model as the base model which is linked to a hydrologic model to represent time variant flow hydrograph of watershed runoff hydrologic model can be used as the base model for the simulation of compound flooding by liking and coupling it with a coastal hydrodynamic model joyce et al 2018 santiago collazo et al 2019 silva araya et al 2018 when a hydrologic model is used as the base model the changing water levels or wave heights at the downstream should be used as the boundary condition from storm surge model several hydrologic models such as us epa storm water management model swmm gironás et al 2010 interconnected channel and pond routing icpr joyce et al 2018 soil and water assessment tool swat douglas mankin et al 2010 and hec hydrologic modeling system hec hms knebl et al 2005 are often explored in different studies to represent the capability of simulating overland flow and flow routing for coastal urban flood e g lewis et al 2013 zahmatkesh et al 2015 hervouet 2007 swmm is capable of simulating both rainfall runoff processes and underground drainage systems hydraulic where the latter simulation has been less addressed by other hydrologic models in a coastal urban setting the pluvial flooding combined with sea level rise can be simulated with swmm sadler et al 2020 storm surge effect can be also simulated using wind speed and pressure as meteorological inputs for the parametric cyclone module of the coastal hydrodynamic models tanim and akter 2019 moreover a mass balance based overland flow model governed by the diffusive wave equation for flow routing with tidal boundary conditions can be used for the simulation of compound floods shahapure et al 2010 however this approach is not an efficient method for the tidal dominated systems such as a bay with complex tide surge interactions an integrated modeling system requires simultaneous exchange and share of information between several computational models depending on the tidal surge or wave characteristics 1 2 model coupling current methods of coupling several numerical models can be classified into 4 classes one way two way tight and fully coupling santiago collazo et al 2019 in a one way coupling framework simulation and computation sequences happen one after the other the two way coupling approach exchanges information between models in an iterative manner and the tightly coupling approach has both models included within the same modeling framework santiago collazo et al 2019 finally fully coupled moldering framework offers solving all the physical processes equations simultaneously in one way coupling framework uncertainty associated with the model parameters boundary conditions and modeling process propagates throughout the linked models in series joyce et al 2018 this calls for novel techniques to quantify track and minimize propagated uncertainty through the modeling process and reduce the systematic errors this novelty is represented in this study by employing the joint probability of random events sklar s theorem and copula functions to quantify the uncertainty in one way coupling framework 1 3 uncertainty analysis of models outputs using copulas model set up process for coastal hydrologic systems is also associated with uncertainty in model parameterization where inaccurate parameters might lead into misfit or oversimplifies of the simulation depending on the model objectives a sets of methods and algorithms have been used for this purpose including copula functions lee and salas 2011 liu et al 2020 pareto front khu and madsen 2005 moore et al 2010 bayesian sampling xu et al 2017 markov chain monte carlo simulation zhang et al 2018 and so on among these methods copula is a robust uncertainty assessment tool which maintains spatial and temporal dependence characteristics of the observed and simulated datasets aghakouchak et al 2010 moazami et al 2014 copula functions in simulation of nonlinear dependence structures and model uncertainty is getting broader attention in hydrological studies hao and singh 2016 zengchao and vijay 2020 these functions form the joint multivariate probability distribution of multiple variables using their marginal probability distribution sungur and nelson 2006 application of copulas in compound flood probability and coastal flood risk assessment has been increased in recent years several studies e g zellou and rahali 2019 xu et al 2014 lian et al 2013 investigated the compound flood risk assessment with the dependence between high tide event and heavy rainfall using copulas in a low gradient coastal region the flood transition zone bilskie and hagen 2018 i e tidal and non tidal regime can be found by the propagation of high tide in low elevated places the multivariate copulas maintain the spatial dependence structure of multiple error factors which can be applied to establish bias correction inundation model in flood transition zone therefore the copulas can be engaged in enhancement of the accuracy of coastal urban flood modeling didier et al 2019 sadegh et al 2018 as it is discussed above the key mechanism of coastal urban flood relies on rainfall runoff and tidal surge interaction in this regard the role of tides in coastal urban flood is still poorly understood the main goal of this study is to capture the knowledge gaps for understanding the dynamic mechanism of compound flooding events through development of an integrated modeling framework while the coastal hydrodynamic model or storm surge model is often selected as the base model the rainfall runoff process would be ignored which results in appearance of considerable uncertainty in modeling thus this study offers a holistic and unique approach for modeling which links a hydrological model with a coastal hydrodynamic model accordingly a two way coupled storm surge wave model delft3d and swan and hydrologic model swmm is established the influence of the surge propagation characteristics timing and phase of tidal surge is examined in drainage system of chittagong city to address the issues of the hybrid modeling framework inherent uncertainty this study also utilized a multivariate copula model in the next section critical features of chittagong city as the main study area are described then the proposed compound modeling framework is discussed and all components of the models are presented in section 3 the calibration and validation results of the compound modeling and a multivariate copula are presented in section 4 finally the tidal surge and rainfall runoff interaction results are analyzed in section 5 2 study area historical floods in chittagong city are compelling examples of compound flooding events in urbanized coastal regions and thus selected as the study case the city located at southeastern part of bangladesh coast which is the most vulnerable place of storm tidal surge mullick et al 2019 the main chittagong catchment has the area of about 44 19 km2 where about 230 000 reside in this basin the long term historical average of rainfall is about 3 000 mm year and average temperature is 25 c in chittagong the drainage system of chittagong city comprises of lined channels and natural waterways which accumulate and carry the most of rainfall runoff from upstream and backwater flow from adjacent tidal karnafuli river and bay of bengal fig 1 no sluice gates detention ponds or other flood controlling structures exist in the current system the drainage system has no barrier for the frequent nuisance flooding during high tide or spring tide events from adjacent tidal karnafuli river and bay of bengal three tributaries of karnafuli river including khal no 10 chaktai khal and mohesh khal drain out the rainfall runoff from the city the tide range of the adjacent karnafuli river varies between 4 m and 6 m during a year here we focused more on the tidal affected drainage systems mullick et al 2019 reported that it is less likely that this coastal city is susceptible to coastal flood for the parts with elevation greater than 9 5 m therefore the parts of the chittagong city with higher elevations above 9 5 m were not included in our analysis the coastal urban floods in this city are mainly influenced by the coastal forcing and topography of the adjacent chittagong coast high tide amplitude 4 6 m along with the mild coastal slope intensifies the propagation of the storm surge the tides in chittagong coast are semi diurnal with noticeable variation of m2 harmonic constituents coastal flood frequency and damages in chittagong city have been exacerbated by unregulated urbanization happened in recent years the chittagong coast has experienced the highest number of tropical cyclones in bangladesh coast including cyclone 1991 which resulted in death of 140 000 people alam and dominey howes 2015 during 2013 14 this city experienced about 13 flood events with inundation depths ranging from 0 13 to 0 3 m and the inundation lasts for up to 48 h akter et al 2017 although cyclones may hit other parts of bangladesh coast because the bengal bay has a funnel shape at its head the surges usually accumulate near the chittagong coast hussain et al 2017 in situ hydrographic records have proven that the chittagong coast has the second highest slr 9 47 mm year in the northern indian ocean over the last few decades carvalho and wang 2019 all in all the chittagong city is a compelling test bed for the investigation of the underlying mechanism in compound urban coastal flooding 3 methodology here the modeling has been done in three stages during the first stage a coupled coastal hydrodynamic model delft3d and swan is developed to obtain the downstream tidal boundary conditions including total water level from storm tidal surge wave tide and astronomic tide stage i outputs are then used as the main inputs to force hydrological modeling swmm at the stage ii finally during the stage iii a copula based model is developed to reduce the uncertainty of the modeling process by adjusting the biases from modeling outputs the schematic of integrated framework is presented in fig 2 3 1 storm surge modeling at the first stage the storm surge model for this study should be coupled with a wave flow modeling system for this purpose delft3d flow and swan are selected and coupled in this study the storm tracks cyclone mora and 1991 selected area for storm surge modeling deft3d grids and land use classifications are shown in fig 3 the cyclone track was obtained from international best track archive for climate stewardship ibtracs https www ncdc noaa gov ibtracs and landuse data was obtained from the analysis carried by mullick et al 2019 3 1 1 tide modeling in this research delft3d flow model computes tide and storm surge heights resulted from meteorological forcing i e wind and pressure the hydrodynamic module of delft3d solves the 2d depth averaged or the 3d nonlinear shallow water equations hydraulics 2014 delft3d rgfgrid a boundary fitted grid generation tool is used to generate structured grids for the hydrodynamic module grids were further refined from spline to the aspect ratio below five fig 3 the total number of generated grid cells for this study is 56 637 which cover an area of about 251 000 km2 of the study region the finer resolution grids were assigned over the nearshore and continental shelf resolution of 0 5 1 km to improve the skill of the hydrodynamic modeling the coarser resolution grids were applied at deep sea with maximum 6 km resolution the bathymetry representation for the region was enhanced by merging satellite images derived from gebco bathymetry hydrographic charts of bangladesh navy and mongla port authority the manning s roughness coefficient n varies spatially and they are assigned based on different land cover types and water depth recommended by deb and ferreira 2016 and krien et al 2017 due to the presence of mangrove forests and varieties of vegetation types along the coastal region land cover map from cci lc 2017 are used the whole domain of delft3d flow was forced by harmonic constituents at 16 tide stations krien et al 2016 found 12 dominant harmonic constituents t2 k1 k2 m2 n2 o1 p1 q1 s2 2n2 nu2 and mu2 in the northern bay of bengal and those constituents are used to force the delft3d flow moreover according to rose and bhaskaran 2017 recommendations each station was additionally forced by shallow water and long period harmonic constituents 3 1 2 coupled wave flow modeling to account for the non linear interactions between tides waves atmospheric forcing during storm surges this study couple the hydrodynamic simulation of delft3d with the swan model the currents are adopted from hydrodynamic model and wave characteristics in terms of significant wave height swh then they are passed to delft3d and swan models to get the radiation stresses radiation stresses further produce the wave forcing for the total water level of storm surge the swan model with coupling intervals of 30 min is used for wave flow coupling swan model is implemented using 36 directional and 24 frequency bins to consider the wave propagation in all directions the logarithmic frequency bins range from 0 05 to 1 hz with an angular resolution of 10 wave growth mechanism based on komen et al 1984 is applied to simulate wind waves the quadruplet s discrete interaction approximation was employed to account for the non linear wave wave interactions due to spatial variation of the roughness length near shore the bottom friction is formulated using 0 05 m bottom roughness length scale suggested by madsen et al 1988 thus the wave conditions are estimated using swh and significant wave period to represent the wave characteristics for the shallow water depth induced wave breaking is determined using the breaking index γ 0 73 as per battjes and janssen 1978 spectral model the wave boundary conditions were computed from wave spectra of the wavewatch iii ww3 model and forced with three hour interval wave datasets which further are reanalyzed and interpolated at a 30 min interval to perform hindcasting integral wave parameters i e swh mean wave period peak wave direction are analyzed using matlab from ww3 model results the deep water wave boundary located at the southern open sea is used to enter the wave energy into computational domain finally the coupled wave flow model is developed to simulate the storm surge during cyclone 1991 and mora more information about development and coupling of this model is presented in tanim and akter 2019 3 1 3 wind model representation of the cyclone wind profile is the key element in order to represent accurate storm surge the meteorological forces wind velocity and pressure are modeled using a parametric cyclone model to represent the cyclone generated forcing over coastal water based on holland et al 2010 the use of six hour intervals are considered for cyclone track information from international best track archive the asymmetry of the cyclone wind field was imposed based on the vickery and wadhera 2008 relationship between radius of maximum wind rmw and central pressure at cyclone eye the cyclone track consists of six hour interval cyclone wind speed and pressure which are further disaggregated into 15 min intervals in order to update the cyclone position for swan and delft3d flow model coupling the wind drag force was formulated following wu 1982 1 f d 1 2875 10 3 f o r u 10 7 5 m s 0 8 0 065 u 10 10 3 f o r u 10 7 5 m s where f d is the drag coefficient and u 10 is the wind velocity at 10 m above the ground surface in delft3d model the parametric holland model was incorporated using delft dashboard a matlab toolbox a 60 50 dimension spider grids are developed to represent the spatial pattern of cyclone wind and pressure 3 2 pluvial flood modeling swmm model is selected in this study to simulate the rainfall runoff process and 1 d storm drainage modeling during the flooding events the physical components of swmm such as subcatchments and drainage systems were sketched and prepared for modeling using arcgis the shuttle radar topography mission srtm 30 m resolution digital elevation model dem maps are then analyzed using arc gis v10 1 here the hec geohms terrain processing tool is used to delineate the total of 18 sub catchments about 78 21 of the study area is developed fig 2 hence curve number would be an appropriate method for rainfall runoff modeling ghodsi et al 2020 curve numbers for the study area are derived based on 10 m resolution sentinel 2 satellite imagery information mullick et al 2019 the satellite images are classified into seven land classes developed area sand water body crop land low density vegetation high density vegetation and grassland the information regarding soil type are collected from chittagong development authority cda soil survey 2006 the hydrologic soil group are determined based on the soil infiltration rate the land use information and the hydrologic group of the soil are used to identify the appropriate soil conservation service scs curve number for each pixel considering normal antecedent condition mishra and singh 2003 then the modified scs equation eq 2 was used to estimate the curve numbers in each subcatchment 2 c n a w i 1 i n c n i a i i 1 i n a i where cnaw is the area weighted average curve number for each subcatchment aw cni is the curve number for each land use and soil group i and ai is the total area of each land use type the drainage network existing drainage layout from cda was transferred from arcgis to the swmm model total of 152 transects conduits irregular channel cross section and 136 junction nodes are generated in swmm model to represent the drainage network seven outlets are identified along the karnaphuli river and one outlet is placed at the bay of bengal to allow the surge propagation backwater effect is simulated using the dynamic wave routing method using 30 sec time steps meteorological information such as rainfall wind speed evaporation temperature and humidity was gathered in 3 hour intervals from the only available meteorological station in this region called potenga fig 1 3 2 1 historical coastal urban flood events two tropical cyclones cyclone mora and 1991 were selected in this study to examine the storm surge impacts table 1 the cyclone mora was a category 1 cyclone and cyclone 1991 was category 5 in saffir simpson scale during those cyclone events a 3 hour interval rainfall time series was used for swmm model simulation the models are calibrated and validated just for the cyclone mora later different model scenarios table 2 were generated to obtain rainfall runoff and surge interactions the surge arrival time varies for different scenarios with the changes of 2 hour leads lags from cyclone 1991 the lagging or leading surge arrival time causes sets of new types of interactions between surge and tidal phases consequently the tide surge interaction produces different surge height magnitude that can be assigned as tide phase shifting during the coastal urban flood 3 3 copula joint probability estimation the one way coupling system applied in this study is subjected to errors from boundary conditions this error can be reduced by adjusting biases from observed data using copula functions the sklar s theorem interprets there exist a function copula c that links multivariate distribution g to marginal distributions of random variables fi xi for a d dimensional copula the multivariate distribution is expressed as eq 3 nelsen 2006 3 g x c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f d x d x x 1 x n d r d from the distribution copulas can be constructed as eq 4 4 c u g f 1 1 u 1 f d d u d u u 1 u d 0 1 d and c 0 1 d 0 1 multivariate copula simulates the spatial dependence structure among variables that have independent choice of marginal distribution function aghakouchak et al 2010 copula function has been often used for uncertainty evaluation where uncertainty can be expressed by the probability distribution of the variable a multivariate copula has been utilized in this study where the necessary steps are presented as follows i the biases have been identified between comparing the modeling output results and observed water depth from three stream gauges coastal urban flood information during mora is used for adjusting the model outputs and bias correction about 80 of the dataset has been used to train and calibrate the copula model while the remaining 20 data is employed to evaluate the performance of copula model ii the difference between observed xo and simulated depth xs at each gauge is considered as observed biases εo eq 5 the value of observed bias is obtained during mora for each gauge i separately 5 ε o i 1 n x o i x s i n where n is the number of observations iii the observed biases at each gauge are fitted to their marginal distribution the best fit probability distributions for each observed ensemble of biases are identified using the anderson darling goodness of fit test to check the statistical significance of the fitted distribution at 5 significance level normal distribution is found as the best marginal distribution for observed biases with negligible tail dependence then the cumulative distribution functions cdfs of the biases are computed for each gauge iv four different multivariate copula functions gaussian aghakouchak et al 2010 žežula 2009 2 t copula demarta and mcneil 2005 clayton mcneil 2008 and frank hofert and mächler 2011 liebscher 2008 have been tested here to find the best fit the aic and bic tests are used to find the best fit copula function based on generated cdfs in the previous step table 3 shows the results of aic and bic for four different multivariate copula functions based on this table n dimensional multivariate gaussian copula is selected as the best fit with the lowest aic and bic value while the dimensionality n is 3 which is represented by biases at each three gauges copula models the spatial dependence structure of bias values among different gauges v since the biases at each stream gauge stations are assumed as variables the depth obtained at tidal and non tidal regimes can be treated separately in copula model the gaussian copula is used to generate 1 000 random ensemble samples for each variable biases at three gauges vi the inverses cdfs of randomly generated ensembled are obtained after generating random datasets outliers are detected and removed using mahalanobis distance de maesschalck et al 2000 vii the simulated biases εo are imposed based on flood correlation section 3 4 for identifying the nodes nature tidal or non tidal nodes finally the necessary bias adjustments have been applied on the swmm simulated inundation depths as follows 6 x b a i x s i ε s where x b a i is a bias adjusted depth m at ith stream gauge and x s i is the swmm simulated depth m at ith stream gauge 3 4 flood correlation in order to identify if the coastal urban flood nature is attributed to the fluvial or tidal flooding spearman rank correlation is estimated at each node the spearman rank correlation is a nonparametric indicator which determines if the variable is a monotone function of another variable or not zar 1972 let rx and ry being the rank of the two measurements of variable x and y respectively the spearman rank correlation ρ can be calculated as follows 7 ρ c o v r x r y σ r x σ r y where c o v r x r y indicates the covariance of the rank variables the standard deviations of the variables are σ r x and σ r y the correlation between the two varies between 1 to 1 where 0 indicates no correlation negative and positive values show the negative or positive correlation between variables in order to obtain ρ the inundation depth should be calculated for two different conditions 1 the model is simulated without the tidal curve and 2 the meteorological conditions are excluded and tide curve is used to obtain the inundation depth from tidal flooding the first condition provides inundation depth for pluvial flooding and the second one simulates the coastal flooding from high tide or storm surge 4 results 4 1 model calibration and validation first the hydrologic model should be calibrated based on streamgauge measurements at g1 g2 and g3 the streamgauges g1 and g3 measure tidal flow whereas the streamgauge g2 has non tidal nature the calibration is performed in two stages 1 considering subcatchment width and curve number as calibration parameters and 2 developing a copula model for bias correction the subcatchment parameters are tuned first to achieve a closest fit to the observed dataset then the residual errors should be diminished by the copula model this model is developed based on bias errors obtained from the difference between simulated and observed water level the mean bias will be added to or subtracted from the simulated water level from stage 1 depends if the node has flash or tidal flood nature 4 1 1 copula simulation and bias correction the cdf and pdf of the developed multivariate gaussian copula are shown in fig 4 the pdf and cdf of gaussian copula using randomly generated sample size of 1 000 are shown in fig 4 the cdf was obtained in three gauges showed higher pdf in tidal zone g1 and g3 than other pairs g1 and g2 g2 and g3 the simulation band was adjusted for 95 confidence interval of observed datasets to determine the bias adjusted water level it is clear that from fig 5 the systematic errors in tidal gauges g1 and g3 are more efficiently corrected in comparison to the non tidal gauge g2 the simulated water level at the g3 which is the result of compound flood model indicates lower value than the measured water level fig 5 the g3 gauge is relatively closer to the watershed outlet compared to the other gauges particularly the flood peak was underestimated in compound flood model inclusion of the bias correction module copula model compensates for the errors from the swmm model to improve the results another option could be using a two way coupling technique where the discharge information between both swmm and delft3d model can be exchanged at the regular intervals however the major advantage of using copula model is the simplicity of work minimizing computational time needed for rapid forecasts during the flooding and avoiding the computational complexity caused by higher precision integration 4 1 2 storm surge model validation the storm surge model is validated for the stream gauge g4 during cyclone mora fig 6 a the simulated surge height is affected by tidal influences and small disturbances from the atmospheric forcings about 7 29 percent bias was observed from the gauge measurement which indicates the slight overestimation of 0 35 m surge height the timing and maximum surge height during the cyclone 1991 were further used for validation using the study deb and ferreira 2016 dube et al 2009 fig 6b the maximum surge height was recorded about 4 82 m during the cyclone whereas this number is estimated about 4 7 m and 5 2 m by dube et al 2009 and deb and ferreira 2016 respectively the timing of the peak surge is consistent with deb and ferreira 2016 results 4 1 3 statistical analysis of results in order to evaluate the performance of the coastal urban flood model three statistical tests are performed coefficient of determination r2 percent bias pbias root mean square error rmse table 4 summarizes the model performance assessment during the calibration and validation periods to estimate the storm surge height calibrated model developed by tanim and akter 2019 was used this model is also validated based on information from station g4 during the cyclone mora fig 6a the rmse of the storm surge height estimated about 0 24 m whereas the r2 is about 0 90 the rmse of the simulated water level from bias corrected hydrologic model is about 0 09 0 17 m the copula model 4 6 24 3 improved the predicted inundation depth for biased corrected results from the non corrected models the r2 value 0 95 0 98 at the tidal stream gauges of g1 and g3 represented a reasonable tie with the observed water level on the other hand the non tidal stream gauge s g3 r2 value is estimated about 0 78 to 0 81 the r2 values verify the dependence structure was maintained by the use of multivariate copula in tidal and non tidal nodes the tidal water level data are normally distributed and as the tide shows a harmonic behavior however the water level fluctuations in non tidal gauges has relatively random behavior and this in order to better train the copula model further gauge measurements are required unfortunately there is just one non tidal streamgauge located in the study area and information from this gauge is available thus the copula parameters i e kendall s tau and spearman s rho might pose slight discrepancies in simulated water level 4 2 storm surge simulation to evaluate the performance of the modeling framework the model is used to simulate the storm surge and flood during the cyclone mora and cyclone 1991 the surge peak at chittagong coast was observed about 1 5 2 m during the cyclone mora and 4 4 5 m during cyclone 1991 fig 7 the surge was amassed near the chittagong coast fig 7a and 7b at its landfall location and peak surge duration lasted for about 2 h during cyclone mora and 4 5 h during cyclone 1991 the encircled bay shape near the coast accumulates the surges it is expected that category 5 storms cyclone 1991 comes with greater flood extent and higher surge height fig 7a and b thereby the coastal flood in that cyclone is more intense and the change of tide phase is more prominent the maximum surge height was obtained when the cyclonic force superimposed with the low tide i e the baseline scenario fig 7a the strong wind over the shallow water had increased the surge height the wind wave and elevated water level adjacent to the coast led to coastal flooding according to the horsburgh and wilson 2007 for a tidal surge the surge height is inversely related to the water depth so the surge height during low tides would be higher than the surge height when wind wave coincides with high tide fig 7b the landfall of cyclone mora occurred during the transition phase of high to low tide after the surge peak the immediate low tide phase was not fully developed due to the dropping tide level fig 7b but the landfall of cyclone 1991 was occurred during low tide and caused an extreme flood however the tide surge interaction is one reason which attributes to the maximum surge levels since the wind speed intensity and track of each cyclone can vary considerably they can also produce spatially varied surge maxima in different places and times 4 3 tidal surge and rainfall interaction varying surge arrival time technique is used here for measuring the effect of tide phase shifting on surge height which can produce the tide surge interactions at all possible magnitudes fig 8 a represents the surge height with seven different flood scenarios at the outlet location g4 the magnitude of the surge height was found at it maximum level 4 08 4 8 m in three flood scenarios base 6 h lag and 6 h lead scenarios it is prominent that when high low tide coincides with storm surge the water level would reach to its maximum level this surge hydrograph shape of the northern bay of bengal can better explain the tide surge interactions antony and unnikrishnan 2013 shallow bathymetry adjacent to chittagong coast largely reduces the wave height thus the storm surge process is mainly governed by the tide surge interaction the bathymetric configuration of nearshore amplifies the surge height in tide dominated bay horsburgh and wilson 2007 broad continental shelf of the northern bay of bengal has significant contribution to the formation and magnitude of the tidal surge during high tide phase 6 h lag the surge propagation is faster than the low tide phase base mainly due to relatively smaller bottom friction at high tide and it generates higher phase speed by rise of the water level hussain and tajima 2017 therefore the effects of the bottom friction on the water column during surge propagation in high tide are less in comparison to lower water levels during low tide conditions since the effects of the bottom friction are less the water column can move faster a tropical cyclone brings enormous rainfall to the coast during the cyclone 1991 the peak rainfall occurred 5 h later than the surge peak fig 8 consequently at first the coastal flood was dominated by the effect of storm surge propagation then heavy rainfall contributed to the compound coastal urban flood and the event became more intense as it is shown in table 5 the base scenario represents the most intense flooding condition table 5 the tropical cyclone induced rainfall follows a wavelike diurnal cycle and two extreme rainfalls gaona et al 2018 hence the tc rainfall is highly varied in both temporal and spatial extent two tropical cyclone induced rainfall extremes can be happened in about 18 h difference gaona and villarini 2018 two rainfall peaks was recorded at 17 00 utc apr 29 and 1 00 utc apr 30 which indicates the diurnal rainfall peaks the overflowed nodes in drainage system and time duration of overflows are shows in fig 9 for a total of 72 h flood simulation the flood response is strongly correlated with tide phase and rainfall intensity the temporal correlation of rainfall intensity and surge peak mostly dominates the intensity of compound flood given the ensemble of model scenarios the number of overflow nodes depends on the tide phase and flood duration fig 9 the maximum inundated nodes were found when the cyclone made landfall with low baseline scenario or high tide phase baseline scenario and 6 h lead lag when the surge height was found maximum the situation can be even staggered if the peak rainfall coincides with the high tide i e 6 h lag scenario when the surge arrives during the high tide phase the flood water cannot drain out because of the high water level at the downstream the duration of surge peak offers a considerable effect on flood duration for flood scenarios 4 h lag 2 h lag and 2 h lead the peak surge durations are around 4 4 5 h and the surge height were estimated about 3 06 3 6 m table 5 when surge interacts with the dropping phase of low tide 2 h lag the surge propagation speed is relatively slower than the rising phase of high tide 4 h lead consequently in slower case 2 h lag the flood has become relatively stable it is also notable that the duration of overflow at nodes for scenarios 2 h lag and 2 h lead are identical fig 9 in both scenarios the timing and peak of surge curves represent similar characteristics fig 9a the least number of nodes were inundated for flood scenario of 4 h lead fig 9 the generated surge peak for this flood scenario coincided with the high tide and no other surge peak were observed hence this scenario has the least number of inundated nodes similarly the inundated nodes were reduced for the flood scenario of 6 h lead in other words when the surge arrival time shifts by a 6 h the interaction between rainfall and surge become stronger and their peaks are at the highest level consequently the number of inundated nodes were reduced by 7 56 in comparison to the baseline scenario however during surge peak of flood scenario with 4 h lead the tide range was obtained 5 6 m which is similar to the high tide event without storm surge in the chittagong coast the tide range amplifies up to 6 m during june july the coincidence of high tide storm surge and rainfall peak can result in extreme coastal urban flood risk pirazzoli et al 2006 thus a high tidal event which is accompanied by an intense precipitation event can form extreme flood in the city the maximum high tide event usually occurs during spring high tide 4 4 flood correlation the outcome of the spearman rank correlation confirmed that the coastal urban flood has compound flood nature contribution from both rainfall runoff and tide the rainfall is the prime factor for urban coastal flooding as for flash flooding it shows ρ 0 12 1 00 fig 10 a about 83 nodes have ρ value above 0 75 for flash flood mostly those nodes are located at the upstream part of the study area the ρ value for tidal flood was obtained between 0 29 and 0 99 with average of 0 51 which indicates that the nature of extreme flood events of the city has secondary sources from tidal effect about 33 of the drainage nodes demonstrated strong correlation ρ value 0 75 with tidal flood apparently in a particular node for tidal flood with the increase of ρ value the flood correlation was decreased with flash flood the distribution of those nodes illustrated in fig 10b and showed the downstream part of the drainage system has significant tidal effect for tidal flood the ρ value increases from upstream to downstream this followed the tidal amplitude which has highest magnitude at outlet that gradually reduced with the inland distance the tropical cyclone induced rainfall has significant rainfall variation with gradual decreasing pattern with the increased distance from coast knight and davis 2007 the surge or tidal flood dominated nodes located near 2 5 km from the adjacent karnafuli river and bay of bengal during passage of tropical cyclone the urbanization of the cities is also responsible for heterogeneous nature of flooding in those nodes apart from the downstream part of the drainage system 5 nodes in the inner part fig 10b showed moderate correlation ρ value 0 5 with tidal flood due to low elevation of drain although the casualties of tropical cyclones frequently attributed to storm surge the flood correlation in this study shows the tropical induced rainfall is mainly responsible 4 5 spatial change of flood 4 5 1 flood duration the spatial changes of flood duration and depth with different flood scenarios are investigated in this section from the swmm simulation it was obtained that the mean flood duration of baseline scenario was 12 55 h fig 11 a about 16 nodes were inundated for 25 37 h in total 3 days flood event simulation when the tide phase was led by 2 h from low tide 2 h lead 92 nodes showed 0 18 0 6 h flood duration difference with respect to baseline scenario δd fig 11b similarly when the tide phase was led by 4 h the mean δd was obtained 0 974 h fig 11c further the tide phase was advanced 6 h from low tide phase i e 6 h lead flood scenario had mean of δd about 1 52 h fig 11d the flood duration was decreased for the leading tide phase due to the rainfall amount was low at those flood scenarios even after the surge peak was 3 06 3 6 m when tide phase was lagged by 2 h and 4 h the mean δd was increased by 1 75 and 1 95 h respectively two factors are responsible to increase the flood duration the surge peak duration for flood scenario 2 h lag and 4 h lag was 4 4 5 h and the maximum rainfall also occurs close to the peak surge period consequently the flood duration was increased in those cases maximum mean δd of 2 42 h was observed in flood scenario 6 h lag in this scenario the peak surge and peak rainfall occurred simultaneously that create most durable flood scenario however in some nodes for the flood scenario 2 and 4 h lag has longer inundation period than 6 h lag fig 11e and 11f this is caused by the inadequate drainage capacity and low elevation of those nodes subsequently the water logging period also increases 4 5 2 flood depth the relation between tide phase shift and compound flood depth as well as the relative change of inundation depth with respect to baseline scenario δh is shown in fig 12 based on the flood duration and flood depth the flood intensity was classified in three classes including high moderate and low table 5 the simulated maximum inundation depth was reached up to 3 76 m during cyclone 1991 fig 12a about 84 of total nodes were inundated with flood depth 0 31 0 6 m the inundation depth of baseline scenario was found 0 31 3 76 m the inundation depth was relatively high near outfall as well as in some low gradient nodes at the upstream part of the study area the elevation near riverbank is relatively high due to hilly terrain but the center of the city is relatively low which is mainly in control for long inundation period in the center of city about 80 nodes have minor response δh between 0 14 to 0 0 with change of the tide phase in different flood scenarios and 20 nodes rapidly response with changing the tide phase those nodes are tidal in nature and have higher spearman correlations with tidal flood when tide phase was led from surge peak the inundation depth was reduced in tidal nodes with δh ranging from 0 54 to 0 15 marked with yellow nodes in fig 12e and 12 g besides with lag of tide phase the flood depth was increased in tidal nodes δh between 0 01 and 0 24 marked with dark blue nodes in fig 12e and 12 g when storm surge and extreme precipitation occurs in succession 2 h 4 h and 6 h lead times the δh was not significantly changed rather the flood depth was reduced on average about 0 05 m the flood scenario 2 h lead and 4 h lag typically result in the lowest number of inundation nodes but when storm surge and extreme precipitation occurs simultaneously e g 6 h lag the compound flood depth even exceeds baseline scenario the δh was increased by 0 01 0 24 m in 5 nodes while on average the flood depth was increased by 0 1 m in compare to baseline scenario fig 12g when the high tide propagates through the drainage network it delays the runoff disposal to the adjacent karnafuli river consequently the flood duration and depth were increased and the flood also extended in the upstream part of catchment area fig 12a and 12 g when the surge propagates the karnafuli river adjacent coast was faster inundated before inundated in the upstream part of the catchment however a 2d inundation model is more appropriate to detect the δh rather than a 1d swmm model if the invert elevation of a node is located below the high tide elevation the drainage system is more susceptible to tidal flood these nodes which represent the highest inundation depth due to tidal flood can reduce the drainage capacity even before the runoff from rainfall propagates through the drain the phenomena which is so called nuisance flooding moftakhari et al 2018 moreover in most cases the downstream drainage section is inadequate to carry the compound flood runoff nevertheless all nodes accounted in this study was not tidal nodes the alarming slr may extend the flood transition zones particularly with the increase of tidal nodes about 17 nodes of the study area have elevation below high tide level therefore with increasing slr a significant portion of the city can be submerged 5 conclusions and discussions this study highlights a hybrid modeling process of compound flood to investigate rainfall runoff and storm tidal surge interactions since complex characteristics of hydraulics and hydrologic processes in coastal urban areas cannot be represented and resolved by single modeling framework this study employed a compound flood model using a hydrologic model swmm as the base model coupled with a coastal hydrodynamic model delft3d the multivariate gaussian copula function is used to represent the uncertainty of model outputs and indicated a reasonable performance to characterize the systematic errors of one way coupling to enhance the calibration of compound flood model the tide phase shifts in coastal urban flood has pronounced effect on flood duration and depth in this study area a compound flood is more intense when peak rainfall and surge peak occur simultaneously rather than in succession when storm surge make landfall in high low tide the surge height reaches at maximum level consequently mean flood duration and depth can be increased by 2 5 h and 0 0 24 m respectively when the storm surge superimposes in a transition phase between high low tide 2 4 h before low high tide the compound flood is more durable as longer surge peak duration 4 4 5 h may occur again the highest time interval between rainfall peak and surge peak make the compound flood less intense and in this case the inundated nodes can be decreased by 7 59 8 9 analyzing coastal urban flood nature requires a better understanding of the main drivers and nature of flood the spearman correlation can be used to identify tidal nodes the coastal urban flood management can benefit from the proper identification of flood correlation with rainfall runoff or tide particularly for designing the urban drainage system one major limitation in different statistical approaches is ignoring the storm surge probability during the low tide surge interaction current models result show high probability of extreme water level when surge arrives during low tide using coastal hydrodynamic model the physical process of surge amplification was considered more appropriately in this study and showed that the non linear tide surge interactions can result in higher surge height and more intense flood during rising low and high tide phase current model framework can be improved using two way coupling techniques where the discharge information between both swmm and delft3d model can be exchanged at regular intervals but the main advantage of using this copula model is the minimizing computational time needed for rapid forecasts during the flooding and avoiding the computational complexity despite those achievements still discrepancies present in several model formulation steps accordingly in future study the hybrid modeling can be improved as follows 1 the copula uncertainty model applied in this study is subject to errors because the limited number of gauges there should be more gauges in particularly tide affected drainage system to characterize the systematic errors as the compound flood probability is high in those drains 2 the coastal hydrodynamic model domain can be extended in drainage network in order to properly account surge decay moreover a 2d hydrologic model or inundation model is more appropriate to represent the compound flood depth 3 the hydrologic model swmm uses a timeseries format for the rainfall input also for this study area the rainfall data are gathered in 3 hr intervals availability of better rainfall measurement and inputs such as radar doppler information can potentially improve the proficiency of rainfall runoff model outputs 4 the study area is 30 and 85 km away from the landfall location of cyclone 1991 and mora respectively although this distance is negligible as the maximum surge height usually produce in area of maximum wind radius the surge height could be even more in case a cyclone made landfall in the study area to meet such purpose synthetic cyclone track can be generated from hurricane weather forecasting hwrf model 5 the 6 hr lead scenario represents that the peak rainfall has arrived before surge peak and the baseline scenario shows the peak rainfall has occurred after arrival of the surge peak it is suggested to consider intensity duration frequency curve of tropical cyclone induced rainfalls and the effect of timing of rainfall peak arrival before or after the peak surge on compound flood intensity in the future studies during a compound flood still the biggest threat to chittagong city is intense precipitation strong correlation of tidal flood was also observed which indicates current sea level has already posed an alarming risk for the compound flood spearman correlation can be used to identify the flood transition zone indicates most of the nodes are rainfall runoff dominated and the tidal nodes are primarily located in low gradient region having invert elevation below high tide level high tide or surge height put additional risk to dispose rainfall runoff by reducing the drainage capacity in tidal nodes it is highly recommended to establish sluicegate at each outfall with adequate pumping facility however to construct such flood control structures not the only solution because without proper controlling the outfall sluice will not

4826,the spatiotemporal variability in precipitation could have a significant impact on ground subsidence in this paper we utilize a previously developed one dimensional theory of consolidation for a two fluid system the generalization of biot s theory to investigate the impact of a time dependent fluid flux across the surface of an unsaturated soil on the solid deformation and pore pressure responses we consider three prescribed fluid flux patterns and the associated gradient of pore water pressure constant periodic and exponential flux patterns we employ a fourier series representation and laplace transformation in the space and time domains to derive a complete set of closed form analytical solutions including the complementary and particular solutions describing both transient and steady state excess pore water and pore air pressure responses as well as the total settlement induced by the fluid flux using two different types of soil i e clay and sand we demonstrate the dependence of the solution on the initial water saturation and hydraulic conductivity in the saturated and unsaturated regimes results of this study reveal that the fluid flux across the surface could have a significant impact on the dissipation of excess pore water pressure and the time evolution of the total settlement of the ground surface the effect on the pore water pressure is more significant for sand than for clay irrespective of moisture content mainly because of the much higher hydraulic conductivity of sand finally we show that the hydraulic conductivity has a dominant

for many decades the problem of coupled solid deformation fluid flow in fully saturated or variably saturated soils caused by variations in external loading or drops in pore fluid pressure has been of great interest not only to hydrogeologists concerned with the prediction of ground subsidence e g galloway et al 1998 kim and parizek 1999 borja and choo 2016 zhang et al 2019 but also to geotechnical engineers concerned with the stability of slopes and the safety and functionality of building foundations e g borja 1992 borja et al 2012b 2012a borja and white 2010 phien wej et al 2006 the mathematical basis of the theory describing water movement in a saturated and deformable porous medium is described by a parabolic partial differential equation for excess pore water pressure that is analogous to the diffusion equation governing the heat flow in solids which was advanced more than 90 years ago by terzaghi 1925 terzaghi s one dimensional theory of consolidation is characterized by a weak link between the solid deformation and pore water pressure through the coefficient of consolidation which are solved sequentially rather than simultaneously although terzaghi s theory has been widely accepted as a significant advance in the mechanics of saturated porous media it does not describe the fully coupled problem where the solid deformation is strongly linked to the pore fluid pressure strong coupling exists for problems in two and three dimensions biot 1956 wang 2000 lo et al 2002 where the balance of linear momentum and balance of fluid mass must be solved simultaneously a mathematical framework was advanced by biot 1941 known as the theory of poroelasticity which provides a more robust treatment of the strong coupling between the solid deformation and pore fluid pressure in a water saturated porous medium the result is a set of coupled partial differential equations where the dependent variables are the solid displacement and excess pore water pressure for one dimensional deformation and flow the two equations uncouple thus simplifying the solution to the problem the theory of poroelasticity was later extended in the dynamic regime to cover wave propagation and attenuation through an elastic fluid saturated porous medium biot 1956 1962 the presence of a second immiscible fluid in the pore spaces within a soil significantly impacts the hydro mechanical coupling between the solid skeleton displacement and the interstitial fluid pressure borja et al 2013 lo et al 2009 2010 song and borja 2014a 2014b based on an average pressure of the non wetting and wetting fluids in the pore spaces bishop 1959 included the effect of partial saturation in biot s 1941 theory to define an effective stress for unsaturated porous media using the continuum principles of thermodynamics borja 2006 presented a rigorous theoretical definition of the effective stress tensor for isotropic porous media which was later demonstrated to be energy conjugate to the rate of deformation of the solid skeleton zhao and borja 2020 later extended the development of effective stress to anisotropic elasto plastic porous media safai and pinder 1979 derived a mixed stress displacement form of partial differential equations to analyze the subsidence phenomena occurring in unsaturated porous media fredlund and hasan 1979 incorporated constitutive mathematical relations linking two stress variables net stress and matrix suction to changes in volume of the soil matrix and water to develop two coupled partial differential equations for the excess pore water and air pressures the model of fredlund and hasan 1979 was generalized to three dimensional problem by dakshanamurthy et al 1984 a set of semi analytical or analytical solutions rooted in the fredlund and hasan 1979 model subjected to either semi permeable or fully permeable boundary condition were deduced to quantify the impact of different types of time dependent surface loading on consolidation in unsaturated soils e g ramp sinusoidal and exponential patterns e g shan et al 2012 zhou et al 2014 wang et al 2017 lo et al 2014 extended the biot 1941 model of consolidation including the concept of effective stress to a more general formulation that contains three coupled partial differential equations with the solid displacement vector as well as the excess pore water and air pressures as dependent variables a series of papers were later devoted to constructing the closed form analytical solutions which systematically cover a comprehensive robust evaluation of the effect due to inherent physical properties and mechanisms such as soil types cyclic loading gravity forces or layered deposition on the poroelastic behaviors in unsaturated soils lo and lee 2015 lo et al 2016 2017 2020 chao et al 2018 deng et al 2019 the studies mentioned above have focused on two central routes toward a better understanding of the coupled deformation flow phenomena in unsaturated porous media a advancing a unifying framework for the development of governing conservation equations and constitutive laws and b assessing quantitatively the impact of various types of external loading on the consolidation process in recent years there have been a number of field observations suggesting that the intensity of precipitation may play a crucial role on the seepage consolidation of fully saturated or partially saturated soils the discrepancy in the average rates of ground subsidence between the wet season may october and dry season november april has reached up to 3 cm year in the southern taiwan during the period of 1995 2000 hsieh et al 2011 similar evidence in the variation of ground subsidence due to fluctuations in rainfall intensity has also been reported from a long term field observation in china gong et al 2018 using the technique of synthetic aperture radar interferometry yang et al 2019 concluded that 60 74 of the annual land subsidence in the central taiwan during the years 2016 and 2017 could be attributed to the scarcity of rainfall during the dry season these observations underscore the necessity to conduct scientific studies to investigate the impact of the flux boundary condition on the poroelastic behavior in unsaturated soils this type of boundary condition requires capturing the hydrological process that truly reflects the climate controlled or soil controlled infiltration or exfiltration measured in terms of the rate of precipitation or rate of potential infiltration or evaporation the main objective of this paper is to develop an analytical technique for incorporating the impact of the flux boundary condition on the coupled stress strain and pressure flow behaviors of unsaturated soils our starting point is the consolidation model of poroelasticity developed by lo et al 2014 to a two fluid system the generalization of biot s 1941 theory the characteristic feature of the proposed model is that the deformation flow mechanisms are rigorously coupled and biot s linear stress strain relationship for a two fluid system accommodates the momentum exchange at the interface caused by the relative motion between solid and fluids the boundary value problem is then formulated based on the conservation laws and the prescribed surface fluid fluxes at the boundary three different types of water pressure gradients are examined including constant periodic and exponential gradients the problem is solved analytically using laplace transformation and fourier series representation that accommodates both steady state and transient poroelastic behaviors the analytical solutions are evaluated numerically using matlab with elasticity and hydraulic parameters applicable to two different types of soil i e sand and clay to examine quantitatively the influence of the flux boundary condition on the spatial and temporal evolutions of the excess pore water pressure and ground settlement 2 model equations poroelasticity theory has become a robust approach for analyzing the intricate time dependent coupling between the deformable solid matrix and compressible interstitial fluids in a variably saturated porous medium such as soils rock masses and biological materials brutsaert 1964 berryman et al 1988 cowin 1999 cheng 2020 employing the continuum mechanics of mixtures truesdell 1984 lo et al 2014 presented a one dimensional model of poroelasticity in the quasi static regime for describing consolidation in a deformable porous medium permeated by two immiscible viscous compressible fluids under a constant total compaction stress which consists of two coupled partial differential equations with p 1 and p 2 as dependent variables the equations take the form 1 1 q 1 p 1 t q 2 p 2 t b 1 2 p 1 z 2 1 2 q 3 p 1 t q 4 p 2 t b 2 2 p 2 z 2 where q 1 q 2 q 3 and q 4 are the elasticity coefficients and b 1 and b 2 are relative fluid mobilities defined by 2 1 q 1 s 1 2 α 2 k b 4 3 g θ 1 2 a 33 a 23 2 a 22 a 33 2 2 q 2

coefficient also known as the effective stress coefficient biot and willis 1957 wang 2000 k s is the bulk modulus of the solid particle a 22 a 23 and a 33 denote the linear elasticity coefficients related to directly measurable soil properties lo et al 2005 lo and sposito 2013 as shown in appendix a once the excess pore water and air pressures p 1 z t and p 2 z t are obtained from eq 1 the time dependent total settlement s t can be in turn evaluated by lo et al 2014 3 s t 0 h w z d z 1 k b 4 3 g p h α 0 h s 1 p 1 s 2 p 2 d z where w denotes a component of the displacement vector of the solid phase along the vertical z direction p refers to the surface total compression stress and h signifies the thickness of an unsaturated soil it should be noted that all physical parameters in eq 1 are evaluated in a reference configuration taken here as the undeformed state prior to the application of an external load because we are dealing with an elastic porous medium undergoing very small deformations biot 1956 lo et al 2005 the central problem in standard theory of poroelasticity accordingly the value of a physical property induced in the current deformed configuration is equal to the value in the reference configuration denoted by a superscript 0 plus the difference between the current and reference values denoted by capital delta δ e g the water saturation s 2 in the current configuration is determined by s 2 s 2 0 δ s 2 the latter is a function of capillary pressure δ s 2 d s 1 d p c p 2 p 1 lo et al 2005 lo and lee 2015 where p c p 1 p 2 is the capillary pressure and d s 1 d p c is the slope evaluated in the reference configuration of the curve relating capillary pressure to the relative saturation of air lo and lee 2015 have demonstrated that the assumption of linearity is a reasonable approximation under the range of water saturation and the magnitude of external load that are examined in the current study changes in water saturation δ s 2 s 2 0 are shown to be small less than 2 6 so that soils behave elastically and exhibit a linear relation between their strain and the applied stress indeed we note that most naturally occurring soil deposits often reveal heterogeneity in their material properties such as double porosity caused by aggregated structures choo et al 2016 and spatial variability in soil texture arising from stratifications lo et al 2020 among others our study serves as an essential first step toward developing a more comprehensive theory to better understand the impacts of fluid flux boundary conditions on the consolidation behavior of soils 3 initial and boundary conditions initial conditions are prescribed by considering an instantaneous undrained response i e no change in air or water content throughout the soil layer when p is applied at the top surface z h of the soil sample at t 0 this condition can be expressed mathematically as 4 1 p 1 z 0 γ 1 p α α ϕ a 12 k v u θ 1 p 4 2 p 2 z 0 γ 2 p α α ϕ a 13 k v u θ 2 p where γ ξ denotes the loading efficiency of the fluid phase ξ a 11 a 12 and a 13 are the linear elasticity coefficients lo et al 2005 lo and sposito 2013 as also summarized in appendix a k v u is the undrained vertical bulk modulus or undrained p wave modulus of an unsaturated soil lo et al 2014 defined as the change in uniaxial stress with respect to uniaxial strain under undrained conditions lo and sposito 2013 wang 2000 k v u has the physical representation in terms of measurable parameters 4 3 k v u a 11 2 α ϕ α ϕ a 12 2 α ϕ α ϕ a 13 4 3 g in reference to the boundary condition a time varying water flux induced by potential infiltration or exfiltration due to precipitation or evaporation is allowed at the top surface leading to a transient pressure gradient 5 p 2 z z h i t where z is defined as being positive upward from an arbitrary datum within the soil column thus i t m l 2 t 2 is positive for infiltration and negative for exfiltration equation 5 thus specifies the normal derivative of pore fluid pressure at the boundary conventionally termed the neumann or second type boundary condition mcowen 2003 whereas the top surface is considered permeable to water it is considered to be impervious to air which is governed by 6 p 1 z z h 0 the bottom z 0 surface of the soil sample is fully permeable with respect to both air and water i e 7 p 1 0 t p 2 0 t 0 a schematic diagram of the problem geometry and boundary conditions considered in the current study is illustrated in fig 1 4 analytical solutions it can be seen that the boundary condition for p 2 z t in eq 5 is nonhomogeneous since the problem to be solved is linear according to the principle of superposition courant and hilbert 1962 we can decompose the problem examined into sub problems solving each sub problem individually and then adding the results of each hence the solution to p 2 z t can be assumed to be of the form 8 p 2 z t p 2 z t p 2 z t where p 2 z t is the component of the solution of p 2 z t accounting for the homogeneous boundary condition whereas p 2 z t is responsible for the nonhomogeneous part introducing eq 8 into eq 1 yields the result 9 1 q 1 p 1 t q 2 p 2 t b 1 2 p 1 z 2 q 2 p 2 t 9 2 q 3 p 1 t q 4 p 2 t b 2 2 p 2 z 2 b 2 2 p 2 z 2 q 4 p 2 t similarly we can rewrite the boundary conditions in eqs 5 and 7 as 10 1 p 2 z z h i t p 2 z z h 10 2 p 2 0 t p 2 0 t accordingly eq 10 implies that if p 2 z t is known eq 10 serves as the boundary conditions prescribed for p 2 z t in order to make the boundary conditions for p 2 z t in eq 10 homogeneous we set 11 1 p 2 z z h i t 11 2 p 2 0 t 0 and the fourth term in eq 9 2 equal to zero i e 11 3 2 p 2 z 2 0 by solving eq 11 one obtains the solution of p 2 z t as 12 p 2 z t i t z next substituting eq 12 into eq 9 we get 13 1 q 1 p 1 t q 2 p 2 t b 1 2 p 1 z 2 q 2 i t t z 13 2 q 3 p 1 t q 4 p 2 t b 2 2 p 2 z 2 q 4 i t t z together with the boundary conditions 14 1 p 2 z z h p 1 z z h 0 14 2 p 2 0 t p 1 0 t 0 and the initial conditions 15 1 p 1 z 0 γ 1 p 15 2 p 2 z 0 γ 2 p p 2 z 0 γ 2 p i 0 z following lo et al 2014 we take the solution of p 1 z t and p 2 z t to be given by a fourier trigonometric series of the form 16 1 p 1 z t n 1 p 1 n t sin λ n z 16 2 p 2 z t n 1 p 2 n t sin λ n z where λ n 2 n 1 π 2 h and the functions p 1 n t and p 2 n t are to be determined subsequently it is evident that if the series defined in eq 16 is convergent the boundary conditions in eq 14 are satisfied guenther and lee 1988 similarly the source term on the right side of eq 13 is also assumed to have the fourier series solution 17 i t t z m 1 g m t sin λ m z if the function on the left side of eq 17 is a bounded function satisfying dirichlet s conditions in the interval 0 h eq 17 can be recognized as a fourier sine series representation with the fourier coefficients guenther and lee 1988 18 g m t 2 h 0 h i t t z sin λ m z d z application of eqs 16 and 17 into eq 13 gives rise to 19 1 n 1 q 1 p 1 n t q 2 p 2 n t b 1 λ n 2 p 1 n t sin λ n z q 2 m 1 g m t sin λ m z 19 2 n 1 q 3 p 1 n t q 4 p 2 n t b 2 λ n 2 p 2 n t sin λ n z q 4 m 1 g m t sin λ m z where the primes denote differentiation with respect to t 4 1 constant pressure gradient it is of interest to investigate how the poroelastic response of unsaturated soils varies with different kinds of time dependent pressure gradients caused by precipitation or evaporation three typical surface flux patterns namely constant periodic and exponential patterns are investigated in the current study to identify their importance on the seepage consolidation behavior of unsaturated soils and then to quantify their relative impact let us first consider a time invariant fluid flux type i e a constant pressure gradient i t w this situation could arise when the rainfall input rate is less than the saturated hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soils and thus the infiltration rate can take on a constant value as described in the foregoing section to solve p 1 z t and p 2 z t we need to determine g m t and p 2 z 0 it follows from eqs 15 2 and 18 that one has 20 1 p 2 z 0 γ 2 p i 0 z γ 2 p w z 20 2 g m t 0 leading eq 19 to become 21 1 n 1 q 1 p 1 n t q 2 p 2 n t b 1 λ n 2 p 1 n t sin λ n z 0 21 2 n 1 q 3 p 1 n t q 4 p 2 n t b 2 λ n 2 p 2 n t sin λ n z 0 since the function sin λ n z is orthogonal on the interval of 0 l guenther and lee 1988 one can multiply both sides of eq 21 by sin λ n z integrate with respect to z from 0 to h then interchange the order of summation and integration and again assume a convergent series hence eq 21 reduces to two coupled ordinary differential equations 22 1 q 1 p 1 n t q 2 p 2 n t b 1 λ n 2 p 1 n t 0 22 2 q 3 p 1 n t q 4 p 2 n t b 2 λ n 2 p 2 n t 0 employing the laplace

periodic type flux boundary and investigate how it affects the solid skeleton deformation and the interstitial fluid flow in unsaturated soils this flux boundary condition could occur when the

to evaluate the linear elasticity coefficients q i i 1 4 and relative fluid mobilities b j j 1 2 in eq 1 we need the water retention curve describing the relationship between the capillary pressure p c and the water saturation s 2 as well as the hydraulic conductivity function describing the relationship between the relative permeabilities k r ξ and the water saturation s 2 the well known van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 model is used for this purpose 40 1 1 χ h c n m s 2 e θ 2 θ 2 r θ 2 s θ 2 r 40 2 k r 1 s 2 e 1 s 2 e η 1 s 2 e 1 m 2 m 40 3 k r 2 s 2 e s 2 e η 1 1 s 2 e 1 m m 2 where h c p c ρ 2 g is the matric potential head ρ 2 denoting the material density of water χ n and m are model parameters obtained by fitting experimental data m 1 1 n η is the pore connectivity parameter and θ 2 r and θ 2 s are the residual and saturated volumetric fractions of water van genuchten 1980 we set the water saturation s 2 e equal to the effective water saturation in eq 40 numerical calculations for eqs 25 32 and 39 are carried out in matlab to evaluate the excess pore water pressure p 2 z t along with the time dependent total settlement s t in unsaturated soils with two very different hydraulic conductivities namely sand and clay table 1 lists the elasticity coefficients and hydraulic parameters necessary for numerical studies taken from lo et al 2007 the fitting coefficients for the water retention curve and hydraulic conductivity function corresponding to unsaturated sand and clay respectively are cited from rawls et al 1992 and summarized in table 2 to verify the closed form analytical solution obtained in the current study we compare it to the solution determined for the excess pore water pressure in the biot 1941 model of consolidation under the flux boundary condition as stipulated in section 4 1 the derivation of which is given in appendix e a comparison of the results obtained between eq e7 1 and eq 25 2 when the latter is specialized to full saturation s 2 1 is graphically presented in fig 2 the figure shows an excellent agreement between the results obtained from this study and the biot 1941 model of consolidation the water pressure gradient prescribed at the top surface is 102 n m3 which is the maximum magnitude to ensure that the dimensionless pore water pressure normalized by p is less or equal to unity physically implying that water does not pond at the surface as an aside for the persistence of a constant water pressure gradient it is necessary that the rainfall intensity arising from this gradient is less than the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity figs 3 and 4 depict the relationship between the dimensionless pore water pressure p 2 p and depth as a function of initial water saturation s 2 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 before the application of external loading for unsaturated sand and clay under the constant and no water pressure gradients respectively the water saturations lie within the range observed in field clays where interstitial water and air can be described in a continuum mechanics formulation lo et al 2014 the pore water pressure gradients that replicate rainfall events are 104 n m3 and 105 n m3 respectively for unsaturated sand and clay above which surface water ponding would occur three different time periods corresponding to the rainfall durations of 1 h 12 h and 24 h are selected an examination of the parameter γ 2 in eq 4 2 shows that it takes a numerical value of 0 21 0 20 and 0 30 for clay with respect to s 2 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 whereas the corresponding value in sand is computed to be 0 02 0 03 and 0 06 respectively the physical interpretation of these values is that water sustains a 20 30 portion of an external load at the moment when it is imposed to unsaturated clay as opposed to unsaturated sand where the load is almost 94 98 borne by the solid skeleton within the spectrum of initial water saturation investigated s 2 0 7 0 9 it is clear from figs 3 and 4 that the dimensionless pore water pressure is indeed elevated due to the presence of surface water flux and enhances with an increase in initial water saturation the enhancement is more significant in sand this result can be readily understood that an unsaturated soil with a higher initial water saturation has a higher hydraulic conductivity leading to more water infiltration and in turn more buildup of excess water pressure accordingly this would yield less total settlement a result as demonstrated in figs 5 and 6 inspection of these two figures also points out that the maximum difference in total settlement between the constant and no water pressure gradients occurs at s 2 0 9 irrespective of soil type this is physically consistent with figs 2 and 3 where the greatest variation in excess pore water pressure also appears at this water content i e s 2 0 9 in contrast to unsaturated sand the effect on the dimensionless pore water pressure because of the introduction of surface water pressure gradient is obvious only at the top boundary for unsaturated clay fig 5 c indicates that the accumulation of pore water pressure owing to surface water flux is more than its dissipation in unsaturated sand see also fig 3 c thus causing its total settlement to be smaller than that initially generated at t 0 the maximum difference in total settlement is found in unsaturated sand at s 2 0 9 which is approximately 0 3 cm in one day to gain more physical insight into the impact of surface fluid flux on soil consolidation behaviors under full and partial moisture contents the dependence of dimensionless pore water pressure on depth h 1 10 m and initial water saturation s 2 0 7 0 8 0 9 and 1 is plotted in figs 7 and 8 for sand and clay respectively one can observe from figs 7 and 8 that with an expectation in unsaturated sand at s 2 0 7 the excess pore water pressure is greatest in a water saturated soil s 2 1 this is because more surface water is permitted for quick infiltration due to its higher hydraulic conductivity the influence of surface fluid flux and moisture content on total settlement is illustrated in figs 9 and 10 respectively as opposed to unsaturated soils water sustains an external load almost entirely 99 100 at the moment when it is applied to saturated soils thus no immediate settlement takes place mathematically this is because the loading coefficient γ in eq e4 4 is equal to 0 99 and 1 for saturated sand and clay respectively changes in total settlement due to variations in water saturation are more significant in clay with a maximum discrepancy of around 6 cm in one day between s 2 1 and s 2 0 7 under a constant water pressure gradient of 102 n m3 figs 11 and 12 respectively show variations in dimensionless pore water pressure in unsaturated sand and clay subjected to the periodic type and no water pressure gradients with respect to initial water saturation s 2 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 along depth the water pressure gradient is assumed to oscillate between 10 3 and 10 4 n m3 in unsaturated sand and between 10 4 and 10 5 n m3 in unsaturated clay the period is one cycle per hour a comparison of figs 3 4 and 11 12 evidently indicates that for given water saturation and soil type the excess pore water pressure under the periodic type water pressure gradient is always less than that under the constant type one this is due to the fact that total water flux entering into the top boundary at the former is smaller than that at the latter a graphical representation of the distribution of total settlement s t with initial water saturation s 2 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 under the periodic type and no water pressure gradients is given in figs 13 and 14 for unsaturated sand and clay respectively it is apparent that the total settlement in unsaturated sand exhibits the response of a harmonic oscillation the effect of the exponential type water pressure gradient on the excess pore water pressure is evaluated in figs 15 and 16 respectively for unsaturated sand and clay at various initial water saturations depths and elapsed times figs 17 and 18 provide a quantitative description of the time evolution of the corresponding total settlement the exponential type fluid flux occurs as the rainfall rate is greater than the saturated hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soils therefore the pressure gradient is assumed to decay from 10 6 to 10 5 n m3 and from 10 5 to 10 4 n m3 for unsaturated clay and sand with a decay time constant α k of 0 1 1 sec respectively the range of surface fluid flux is one order of magnitude greater than that examined for the periodic type by comparing figs 3 6 with figs 15 18 we can see that the excess pore water pressure and time dependent total settlement generated by the exponential type water pressure gradient reveals a similar tendency to those subjected to the constant water pressure gradient 6 conclusions it has been known for many years that the rate of ground subsidence exhibits pronounced temporal fluctuations with rainfall during the dry and wet seasons to better understand this phenomenon the current study develops a physically based model that quantifies the impacts of surface fluid flux on the settlement behavior of both unsaturated and saturated soils the formulation leads to a set of nonhomogeneous coupled partial differential equations due to the presence of source terms arising naturally from the flux boundary condition closed form analytical solutions are derived using the technique of fourier series representation and laplace transformation the proposed solution is sufficiently general in that it provides a direct approach for incorporating any arbitrary form of surface fluid flux the analytical solutions derived from the proposed approach consist of complementary and particular solutions describing the transient and steady state excess pore water and pore air pressures as well as the total settlement resulting from an applied surface fluid flux under a constant total compressive force they are useful in practice in that they quantify the ground settlement and pore fluid pressures due to surface fluid flux caused by rainfall or evaporation events for a given moisture content variations in the excess pore water pressure and the rate of settlement are more significant for sand than for clay due to the high hydraulic conductivity of sand for the same soil an increase in the initial water saturation also enhances the dissipation of excess pore pressure and ground settlement but the main takeaway from this study is that the hydraulic conductivity has the most significant impact on the dissipation of excess pore pressure and the rate of ground settlement resulting from surface fluid flux for both unsaturated and saturated soils credit authorship contribution statement weicheng lo conceptualization methodology writing original draft supervision juiche chang validation writing review editing

4826,the spatiotemporal variability in precipitation could have a significant impact on ground subsidence in this paper we utilize a previously developed one dimensional theory of consolidation for a two fluid system the generalization of biot s theory to investigate the impact of a time dependent fluid flux across the surface of an unsaturated soil on the solid deformation and pore pressure responses we consider three prescribed fluid flux patterns and the associated gradient of pore water pressure constant periodic and exponential flux patterns we employ a fourier series representation and laplace transformation in the space and time domains to derive a complete set of closed form analytical solutions including the complementary and particular solutions describing both transient and steady state excess pore water and pore air pressure responses as well as the total settlement induced by the fluid flux using two different types of soil i e clay and sand we demonstrate the dependence of the solution on the initial water saturation and hydraulic conductivity in the saturated and unsaturated regimes results of this study reveal that the fluid flux across the surface could have a significant impact on the dissipation of excess pore water pressure and the time evolution of the total settlement of the ground surface the effect on the pore water pressure is more significant for sand than for clay irrespective of moisture content mainly because of the much higher hydraulic conductivity of sand finally we show that the hydraulic conductivity has a dominant

for many decades the problem of coupled solid deformation fluid flow in fully saturated or variably saturated soils caused by variations in external loading or drops in pore fluid pressure has been of great interest not only to hydrogeologists concerned with the prediction of ground subsidence e g galloway et al 1998 kim and parizek 1999 borja and choo 2016 zhang et al 2019 but also to geotechnical engineers concerned with the stability of slopes and the safety and functionality of building foundations e g borja 1992 borja et al 2012b 2012a borja and white 2010 phien wej et al 2006 the mathematical basis of the theory describing water movement in a saturated and deformable porous medium is described by a parabolic partial differential equation for excess pore water pressure that is analogous to the diffusion equation governing the heat flow in solids which was advanced more than 90 years ago by terzaghi 1925 terzaghi s one dimensional theory of consolidation is characterized by a weak link between the solid deformation and pore water pressure through the coefficient of consolidation which are solved sequentially rather than simultaneously although terzaghi s theory has been widely accepted as a significant advance in the mechanics of saturated porous media it does not describe the fully coupled problem where the solid deformation is strongly linked to the pore fluid pressure strong coupling exists for problems in two and three dimensions biot 1956 wang 2000 lo et al 2002 where the balance of linear momentum and balance of fluid mass must be solved simultaneously a mathematical framework was advanced by biot 1941 known as the theory of poroelasticity which provides a more robust treatment of the strong coupling between the solid deformation and pore fluid pressure in a water saturated porous medium the result is a set of coupled partial differential equations where the dependent variables are the solid displacement and excess pore water pressure for one dimensional deformation and flow the two equations uncouple thus simplifying the solution to the problem the theory of poroelasticity was later extended in the dynamic regime to cover wave propagation and attenuation through an elastic fluid saturated porous medium biot 1956 1962 the presence of a second immiscible fluid in the pore spaces within a soil significantly impacts the hydro mechanical coupling between the solid skeleton displacement and the interstitial fluid pressure borja et al 2013 lo et al 2009 2010 song and borja 2014a 2014b based on an average pressure of the non wetting and wetting fluids in the pore spaces bishop 1959 included the effect of partial saturation in biot s 1941 theory to define an effective stress for unsaturated porous media using the continuum principles of thermodynamics borja 2006 presented a rigorous theoretical definition of the effective stress tensor for isotropic porous media which was later demonstrated to be energy conjugate to the rate of deformation of the solid skeleton zhao and borja 2020 later extended the development of effective stress to anisotropic elasto plastic porous media safai and pinder 1979 derived a mixed stress displacement form of partial differential equations to analyze the subsidence phenomena occurring in unsaturated porous media fredlund and hasan 1979 incorporated constitutive mathematical relations linking two stress variables net stress and matrix suction to changes in volume of the soil matrix and water to develop two coupled partial differential equations for the excess pore water and air pressures the model of fredlund and hasan 1979 was generalized to three dimensional problem by dakshanamurthy et al 1984 a set of semi analytical or analytical solutions rooted in the fredlund and hasan 1979 model subjected to either semi permeable or fully permeable boundary condition were deduced to quantify the impact of different types of time dependent surface loading on consolidation in unsaturated soils e g ramp sinusoidal and exponential patterns e g shan et al 2012 zhou et al 2014 wang et al 2017 lo et al 2014 extended the biot 1941 model of consolidation including the concept of effective stress to a more general formulation that contains three coupled partial differential equations with the solid displacement vector as well as the excess pore water and air pressures as dependent variables a series of papers were later devoted to constructing the closed form analytical solutions which systematically cover a comprehensive robust evaluation of the effect due to inherent physical properties and mechanisms such as soil types cyclic loading gravity forces or layered deposition on the poroelastic behaviors in unsaturated soils lo and lee 2015 lo et al 2016 2017 2020 chao et al 2018 deng et al 2019 the studies mentioned above have focused on two central routes toward a better understanding of the coupled deformation flow phenomena in unsaturated porous media a advancing a unifying framework for the development of governing conservation equations and constitutive laws and b assessing quantitatively the impact of various types of external loading on the consolidation process in recent years there have been a number of field observations suggesting that the intensity of precipitation may play a crucial role on the seepage consolidation of fully saturated or partially saturated soils the discrepancy in the average rates of ground subsidence between the wet season may october and dry season november april has reached up to 3 cm year in the southern taiwan during the period of 1995 2000 hsieh et al 2011 similar evidence in the variation of ground subsidence due to fluctuations in rainfall intensity has also been reported from a long term field observation in china gong et al 2018 using the technique of synthetic aperture radar interferometry yang et al 2019 concluded that 60 74 of the annual land subsidence in the central taiwan during the years 2016 and 2017 could be attributed to the scarcity of rainfall during the dry season these observations underscore the necessity to conduct scientific studies to investigate the impact of the flux boundary condition on the poroelastic behavior in unsaturated soils this type of boundary condition requires capturing the hydrological process that truly reflects the climate controlled or soil controlled infiltration or exfiltration measured in terms of the rate of precipitation or rate of potential infiltration or evaporation the main objective of this paper is to develop an analytical technique for incorporating the impact of the flux boundary condition on the coupled stress strain and pressure flow behaviors of unsaturated soils our starting point is the consolidation model of poroelasticity developed by lo et al 2014 to a two fluid system the generalization of biot s 1941 theory the characteristic feature of the proposed model is that the deformation flow mechanisms are rigorously coupled and biot s linear stress strain relationship for a two fluid system accommodates the momentum exchange at the interface caused by the relative motion between solid and fluids the boundary value problem is then formulated based on the conservation laws and the prescribed surface fluid fluxes at the boundary three different types of water pressure gradients are examined including constant periodic and exponential gradients the problem is solved analytically using laplace transformation and fourier series representation that accommodates both steady state and transient poroelastic behaviors the analytical solutions are evaluated numerically using matlab with elasticity and hydraulic parameters applicable to two different types of soil i e sand and clay to examine quantitatively the influence of the flux boundary condition on the spatial and temporal evolutions of the excess pore water pressure and ground settlement 2 model equations poroelasticity theory has become a robust approach for analyzing the intricate time dependent coupling between the deformable solid matrix and compressible interstitial fluids in a variably saturated porous medium such as soils rock masses and biological materials brutsaert 1964 berryman et al 1988 cowin 1999 cheng 2020 employing the continuum mechanics of mixtures truesdell 1984 lo et al 2014 presented a one dimensional model of poroelasticity in the quasi static regime for describing consolidation in a deformable porous medium permeated by two immiscible viscous compressible fluids under a constant total compaction stress which consists of two coupled partial differential equations with p 1 and p 2 as dependent variables the equations take the form 1 1 q 1 p 1 t q 2 p 2 t b 1 2 p 1 z 2 1 2 q 3 p 1 t q

related to directly measurable soil properties lo et al 2005 lo and sposito 2013 as shown in appendix a once the excess pore water and air pressures p 1 z t and p 2 z t are obtained from eq 1 the time

phase along the vertical z direction p refers to the surface total compression stress and h signifies the thickness of an unsaturated soil it should be noted that all physical parameters in eq 1 are evaluated in a reference configuration taken here as the undeformed state prior to the application of an external load because we are dealing with an elastic porous medium undergoing very small deformations biot 1956 lo et al 2005 the central problem in standard theory of poroelasticity accordingly the value of a physical property induced in the current deformed configuration is equal to the value in the reference configuration denoted by a superscript 0 plus the difference between the current and reference values denoted by capital delta δ e g the water saturation s 2 in the current configuration is determined by s 2 s 2 0 δ s 2 the latter is a function of capillary pressure δ s 2 d s 1 d p c p 2 p 1 lo et al 2005 lo and lee 2015 where p c p 1 p 2 is the capillary pressure and d s 1 d p c is the slope evaluated in the reference configuration of the curve relating capillary pressure to the relative saturation of air lo and lee 2015 have demonstrated that the assumption of linearity is a reasonable approximation under the range of water saturation and the magnitude of external load that are examined in the current study changes in water saturation δ s 2 s 2 0 are shown to be small less than 2 6 so that soils behave elastically and exhibit a linear relation between their strain and the applied stress indeed we note that most naturally occurring soil deposits often reveal heterogeneity in their material properties such as double porosity caused by aggregated structures choo et al 2016 and spatial variability in soil texture arising from stratifications lo et al 2020 among others our study serves as an essential first step toward developing a more comprehensive theory to better understand the impacts of fluid flux boundary conditions on the consolidation behavior of soils 3 initial and boundary conditions initial conditions are prescribed by considering an instantaneous undrained response i e no change in air or water content throughout the soil layer when p is applied at the top surface z h of the soil sample at t 0 this condition can be expressed mathematically as 4 1 p 1 z 0 γ 1 p α α ϕ a 12 k v u θ 1 p 4 2 p 2 z 0 γ 2 p α α ϕ a 13 k v u θ 2 p

varying water flux induced by potential infiltration or exfiltration due to precipitation or evaporation is allowed at the top surface leading to a transient pressure gradient 5 p 2 z z h i t where z is defined as being positive upward from an arbitrary datum within the soil column thus i t m l 2 t 2 is positive for infiltration and negative for exfiltration equation 5 thus specifies the normal derivative of pore fluid pressure at the boundary conventionally termed the neumann or second type boundary condition mcowen 2003 whereas the top surface is considered permeable to water it is considered to be impervious to air which is governed by 6 p 1 z z h 0 the bottom z 0 surface of the soil sample is fully permeable with respect to both air and water i e 7 p 1 0 t p 2 0 t 0 a schematic diagram of the problem geometry and boundary conditions considered in the current study is illustrated in fig 1 4 analytical solutions it can be seen that the boundary condition for p 2 z t in eq 5 is nonhomogeneous since the problem to be solved is linear according to the principle of superposition courant and hilbert 1962 we can decompose the problem examined into sub problems solving each sub problem individually and then adding the results of each hence the solution to p 2 z t can be assumed to be of the form 8 p 2 z t p 2 z t p 2 z t where p 2 z t is the component of the solution of p 2 z t accounting for the homogeneous boundary condition whereas p 2 z t is responsible for the nonhomogeneous part introducing eq 8 into eq 1 yields the result 9 1 q 1 p 1 t q 2 p 2 t b 1 2 p 1 z 2 q 2 p 2 t 9 2 q 3 p 1 t q 4 p 2 t b 2 2 p 2 z 2 b 2 2 p 2 z 2 q 4 p 2 t similarly we can rewrite the boundary conditions in eqs 5 and 7 as 10 1 p 2 z z h i t p 2 z z h 10 2 p 2 0 t p 2 0 t accordingly eq 10 implies that if p 2 z t is known eq 10 serves as the boundary conditions prescribed for p 2 z t in order to make the boundary conditions for p 2 z t in eq 10 homogeneous we set 11 1 p 2 z z h i t 11 2 p 2 0 t 0 and the fourth term in eq 9 2 equal to zero i e 11 3 2 p 2 z 2 0 by solving eq 11 one obtains the solution of p 2 z t as 12 p 2 z t i t z next substituting eq 12 into eq 9 we get 13 1 q 1 p 1 t q 2 p 2 t b 1 2 p 1 z 2 q 2 i t t z 13 2 q 3 p 1 t q 4 p 2 t b 2 2 p 2 z 2 q 4 i t t z together with the boundary conditions 14 1 p 2 z z h p 1 z z h 0 14 2 p 2 0 t p 1 0 t 0 and the initial conditions 15 1 p 1 z 0 γ 1 p 15 2 p 2 z 0 γ 2 p p 2 z 0 γ 2 p i 0 z following lo et al 2014 we take the solution of p 1 z t and p 2 z t to be given by a fourier trigonometric series of the form 16 1 p 1 z t n 1 p 1 n t sin λ n z 16 2 p 2 z t n 1 p 2 n t sin λ n z where λ n 2 n 1 π 2 h and the functions p 1 n t and p 2 n t are to be determined subsequently it is evident that if the series defined in eq 16 is convergent the boundary conditions in eq 14 are satisfied guenther and lee 1988 similarly the source term on the right side of eq 13 is also assumed to have the fourier series solution 17 i t t z m 1 g m t sin λ m z if the function on the left side of eq 17 is a bounded function satisfying dirichlet s conditions in the interval 0 h eq 17 can be recognized as a fourier sine series representation with the fourier coefficients guenther and lee 1988 18 g m t 2 h 0 h i t t z sin λ m z d z application of eqs 16 and 17 into eq 13 gives rise to 19 1 n 1 q 1 p 1 n t

respect to t 4 1 constant pressure gradient it is of interest to investigate how the poroelastic response of unsaturated soils varies with different kinds of time dependent pressure gradients caused by precipitation or evaporation three typical surface flux patterns namely constant periodic and exponential patterns are investigated in the current study to identify their importance on the seepage consolidation behavior of unsaturated soils and then to quantify their relative impact let us first consider a time invariant fluid flux type i e a constant pressure gradient i t w this situation could arise when the rainfall input rate is less than the saturated hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soils and thus the infiltration rate can take on a constant value as described in the foregoing section to solve p 1 z t and p 2 z t we need to determine g m t and p 2 z 0 it follows from eqs 15 2 and 18 that one has 20 1 p 2 z 0 γ 2 p i 0 z γ 2 p w z 20 2 g m t 0 leading eq 19 to become 21 1 n 1 q 1 p 1 n t q 2 p 2 n t b 1 λ n 2 p 1 n t sin λ n z 0 21 2 n 1 q 3 p 1 n t q 4 p 2 n t b 2 λ n 2 p 2 n t sin λ n z 0 since the function sin λ n z is orthogonal on the interval of 0 l guenther and lee 1988 one can multiply both sides of eq 21 by sin λ n z integrate with respect to z from 0 to h then interchange the order of summation and integration and again assume a convergent series hence eq 21 reduces to two coupled ordinary differential equations 22 1 q 1 p 1 n t q 2 p 2 n t b 1 λ n 2 p 1 n t 0 22 2 q 3 p 1 n t q 4 p 2 n t b 2 λ n 2 p 2 n t 0 employing the laplace

periodic type flux boundary and investigate how it affects the solid skeleton deformation and the interstitial fluid flow in unsaturated soils this flux boundary condition could occur when the

4 3 exponential type pressure gradient in this section we are concerned with whether the exponential type flux boundary is of great importance in affecting the poroelastic response of unsaturated

to evaluate the linear elasticity coefficients q i i 1 4 and relative fluid mobilities b j j 1 2 in eq 1 we need the water retention curve describing the relationship between the capillary pressure p c and the water saturation s 2 as well as the hydraulic conductivity function describing the relationship between the relative permeabilities k r ξ and the water saturation s 2 the well known van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 model is used for this purpose 40 1 1 χ h c n m s 2 e θ 2 θ 2 r θ 2 s θ 2 r 40 2 k r 1 s 2 e 1 s 2 e η 1 s 2 e 1 m 2 m 40 3 k r 2 s 2 e s 2 e η 1 1 s 2 e 1 m m 2 where h c p c ρ 2 g is the matric potential head ρ 2 denoting the material density of water χ n and m are model parameters obtained by fitting experimental data m 1 1 n η is the pore connectivity parameter and θ 2 r and θ 2 s are the residual and saturated volumetric fractions of water van genuchten 1980 we set the water saturation s 2 e equal to the effective water saturation in eq 40 numerical calculations for eqs 25 32 and 39 are carried out in matlab to evaluate the excess pore water pressure p 2 z t along with the time dependent total settlement s t in unsaturated soils with two very different hydraulic conductivities namely sand and clay table 1 lists the elasticity coefficients and hydraulic parameters necessary for numerical studies taken from lo et al 2007 the fitting coefficients for the water retention curve and hydraulic conductivity function corresponding to unsaturated sand and clay respectively are cited from rawls et al 1992 and summarized in table 2 to verify the closed form analytical solution obtained in the current study we compare it to the solution determined for the excess pore water pressure in the biot 1941 model of consolidation under the flux boundary condition as stipulated in section 4 1 the derivation of which is given in appendix e a comparison of the results obtained between eq e7 1 and eq 25 2 when the latter is specialized to full saturation s 2 1 is graphically presented in fig 2 the figure shows an excellent agreement between the results obtained from this study and the biot 1941 model of consolidation the water pressure gradient prescribed at the top surface is 102 n m3 which is the maximum magnitude to ensure that the dimensionless pore water pressure normalized by p is less or equal to unity physically implying that water does not pond at the surface as an aside for the persistence of a constant water pressure gradient it is necessary that the rainfall intensity arising from this gradient is less than the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity figs 3 and 4 depict the relationship between the dimensionless pore water pressure p 2 p and depth as a function of initial water saturation s 2 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 before the application of external loading for unsaturated sand and clay under the constant and no water pressure gradients respectively the water saturations lie within the range observed in field clays where interstitial water and air can be described in a continuum mechanics formulation lo et al 2014 the pore water pressure gradients that replicate rainfall events are 104 n m3 and 105 n m3 respectively for unsaturated sand and clay above which surface water ponding would occur three different time periods corresponding to the rainfall durations of 1 h 12 h and 24 h are selected an examination of the parameter γ 2 in eq 4 2 shows that it takes a numerical value of 0 21 0 20 and 0 30 for clay with respect to s 2 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 whereas the corresponding value in sand is computed to be 0 02 0 03 and 0 06 respectively the physical interpretation of these values is that water sustains a 20 30 portion of an external load at the moment when it is imposed to unsaturated clay as opposed to unsaturated sand where the load is almost 94 98 borne by the solid skeleton within the spectrum of initial water saturation investigated s 2 0 7 0 9 it is clear from figs 3 and 4 that the dimensionless pore water pressure is indeed elevated due to the presence of surface water flux and enhances with an increase in initial water saturation the enhancement is more significant in sand this result can be readily understood that an unsaturated soil with a higher initial water saturation has a higher hydraulic conductivity leading to more water infiltration and in turn more buildup of excess water pressure accordingly this would yield less total settlement a result as demonstrated in figs 5 and 6 inspection of these two figures also points out that the maximum difference in total settlement between the constant and no water pressure gradients occurs at s 2 0 9 irrespective of soil type this is physically consistent with figs 2 and 3 where the greatest variation in excess pore water pressure also appears at this water content i e s 2 0 9 in contrast to unsaturated sand the effect on the dimensionless pore water pressure because of the introduction of surface water pressure gradient is obvious only at the top boundary for unsaturated clay fig 5 c indicates that the accumulation of pore water pressure owing to surface water flux is more than its dissipation in unsaturated sand see also fig 3 c thus causing its total settlement to be smaller than that initially generated at t 0 the maximum difference in total settlement is found in unsaturated sand at s 2 0 9 which is approximately 0 3 cm in one day to gain more physical insight into the impact of surface fluid flux on soil consolidation behaviors under full and partial moisture contents the dependence of dimensionless pore water pressure on depth h 1 10 m and initial water saturation s 2 0 7 0 8 0 9 and 1 is plotted in figs 7 and 8 for sand and clay respectively one can observe from figs 7 and 8 that with an expectation in unsaturated sand at s 2 0 7 the excess pore water pressure is greatest in a water saturated soil s 2 1 this is because more surface water is permitted for quick infiltration due to its higher hydraulic conductivity the influence of surface fluid flux and moisture content on total settlement is illustrated in figs 9 and 10 respectively as opposed to unsaturated soils water sustains an external load almost entirely 99 100 at the moment when it is applied to saturated soils thus no immediate settlement takes place mathematically this is because the loading coefficient γ in eq e4 4 is equal to 0 99 and 1 for saturated sand and clay respectively changes in total settlement due to variations in water saturation are more significant in clay with a maximum discrepancy of around 6 cm in one day between s 2 1 and s 2 0 7 under a constant water pressure gradient of 102 n m3 figs 11 and 12 respectively show variations in dimensionless pore water pressure in unsaturated sand and clay subjected to the periodic type and no water pressure gradients with respect to initial water saturation s 2 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 along depth the water pressure gradient is assumed to oscillate between 10 3 and 10 4 n m3 in unsaturated sand and between 10 4 and 10 5 n m3 in unsaturated clay the period is one cycle per hour a comparison of figs 3 4 and 11 12 evidently indicates that for given water saturation and soil type the excess pore water pressure under the periodic type water pressure gradient is always less than that under the constant type one this is due to the fact that total water flux entering into the top boundary at the former is smaller than that at the latter a graphical representation of the distribution of total settlement s t with initial water saturation s 2 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 under the periodic type and no water pressure gradients is given in figs 13 and 14 for unsaturated sand and clay respectively it is apparent that the total settlement in unsaturated sand exhibits the response of a harmonic oscillation the effect of the exponential type water pressure gradient on the excess pore water pressure is evaluated in figs 15 and 16 respectively for unsaturated sand and clay at various initial water saturations depths and elapsed times figs 17 and 18 provide a quantitative description of the time evolution of the corresponding total settlement the exponential type fluid flux occurs as the rainfall rate is greater than the saturated hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soils therefore the pressure gradient is assumed to decay from 10 6 to 10 5 n m3 and from 10 5 to 10 4 n m3 for unsaturated clay and sand with a decay time constant α k of 0 1 1 sec respectively the range of surface fluid flux is one order of magnitude greater than that examined for the periodic type by comparing figs 3 6 with figs 15 18 we can see that the excess pore water pressure and time dependent total settlement generated by the exponential type water pressure gradient reveals a similar tendency to those subjected to the constant water pressure gradient 6 conclusions it has been known for many years that the rate of ground subsidence exhibits pronounced temporal fluctuations with rainfall during the dry and wet seasons to better understand this phenomenon the current study develops a physically based model that quantifies the impacts of surface fluid flux on the settlement behavior of both unsaturated and saturated soils the formulation leads to a set of nonhomogeneous coupled partial differential equations due to the presence of source terms arising naturally from the flux boundary condition closed form analytical solutions are derived using the technique of fourier series representation and laplace transformation the proposed solution is sufficiently general in that it provides a direct approach for incorporating any arbitrary form of surface fluid flux the analytical solutions derived from the proposed approach consist of complementary and particular solutions describing the transient and steady state excess pore water and pore air pressures as well as the total settlement resulting from an applied surface fluid flux under a constant total compressive force they are useful in practice in that they quantify the ground settlement and pore fluid pressures due to surface fluid flux caused by rainfall or evaporation events for a given moisture content variations in the excess pore water pressure and the rate of settlement are more significant for sand than for clay due to the high hydraulic conductivity of sand for the same soil an increase in the initial water saturation also enhances the dissipation of excess pore pressure and ground settlement but the main takeaway from this study is that the hydraulic conductivity has the most significant impact on the dissipation of excess pore pressure and the rate of ground settlement resulting from surface fluid flux for both unsaturated and saturated soils credit authorship contribution statement weicheng lo conceptualization methodology writing original draft supervision juiche chang validation writing review editing

4827,climatic shifts disturbances and land use change can alter hydrologic flowpaths water quality and water supply to downstream communities prior research investigating streamflow generation processes in mountainous areas has largely focused on high elevation alpine and subalpine catchments less is known about these processes in lower elevation foothills and montane catchments in these lower elevation ecoregions precipitation shifts seasonally from snow to rain which can result in differing seasonal flowpaths we analyzed stream water for electrical conductivity sio2 ca mg na cl so4 k and dissolved organic carbon on both a weekly and storm event basis from april to august 2018 in three small 10 km2 foothill catchments and one larger 63 2 km2 catchment extending from the foothills to the subalpine ecoregions in the colorado front range using two end member hydrograph separations and concentration runoff relationships we inferred the dominant catchment scale flowpaths of precipitation to the streams we selected catchments with varying land use to investigate the relationship between these characteristics and hydrologic flowpaths we observed that concentrations of lithogenic constituents generally increased and dissolved organic carbon decreased as seasonal runoff decreased in the three foothill catchments reflecting a transition from shallow subsurface flowpaths to deeper subsurface flowpaths elevated so4 and cl concentrations during low flow periods in two of our catchments suggest that historical or current anthropogenic activities such as mining application of road salt and or near stream septic systems affect local stream and groundwater chemistry in a foothill catchment with anthropogenic and geologic impervious surfaces streamflow during

santos et al 2014 sklash et al 1979 the overarching goal of this study is to advance our limited knowledge of how lower elevation mountainous catchments function in the semi arid colorado front range our approach examines catchments with and without anthropogenic impacts such as mining and low density housing as well as catchments that vary in the proportion of annual precipitation inputs i e snow vs rain given that these ecoregions are experiencing trends towards greater rainfall contributions to peak flows kampf and lefsky 2016 we conducted our study in the summer to investigate rain driven processes we address the following research questions what are the dominant flowpaths in lower elevation catchments with varying land use during summer storm events as inferred by hydrometrics and stream chemistry and how do hydrologic flowpaths in these catchments change from early to late summer we address these questions by performing hydrograph separations investigating stream chemistry and runoff behavior during storm events and analyzing the relationship between constituent concentrations and runoff 2 study area we conducted our study in the boulder creek watershed 1 160 km2 located in the colorado front range fig 1 the watershed spans an elevation gradient from 1 480 to 4 120 m and can be divided into five major climatic zones ecoregions plains 1 450 1 800 m foothill 1800 2400 m montane 2400 2700 m subalpine 2700 3500 m and alpine 3500 4200 m murphy 2006 excluding the plains ecoregion which is downstream of our study area the foothill and montane ecoregions comprise 58 of the watershed and the subalpine and alpine regions comprise 42 the foothill regions are underlain by precambrian metamorphic and granitic bedrock predominately gneiss and schist the subalpine regions contain those rock types and also minimal tertiary volcanics and quaternary alluvium deposits see figure in murphy 2006 p 4 summer mid june through mid september precipitation is characterized by convective thunderstorms with substantial spatial variation in rainfall the majority of precipitation in the subalpine and alpine regions is delivered as snow in the winter and spring while in the montane and foothills ecoregions annual precipitation is 30 60 snow 25 40 rain and 15 30 mixed snow and rain that is air temperature crossed 2 c during the event cowie 2010 lower elevations in the boulder creek watershed receive a greater percentage of precipitation in april september than do higher elevations e g the plains receive about 65 of precipitation during that time compared to the subalpine receiving about 53 during that time murphy et al 2015 table s5 highest runoff in boulder creek typically occurs from april june from snowmelt and mixed rain snow events and annual low flow occurs from september to march murphy 2006 we compared three catchments in the foothill and lower montane ecoregions of the watershed keystone gulch hawkin gulch and lost gulch fig 1 these foothill

tremuloides kaufmann et al 2006 most of hawkin gulch and upper portions of keystone gulch are boulder county designated environmental conservation areas keystone gulch has considerably more anthropogenic impacts than hawkin or lost gulch including low density housing and a low intensity trafficked paved road that extends the entire elevation range of the catchment keystone gulch also contains 38 historical underground hard rock mines which are primarily located within a 3 km2 radius and have tunnels that are typically 100 m long lovering and goddard 1950 we compared the three foothills catchments to the larger 63 2 km2 fourmile creek catchment which extends from the foothills to subalpine ecosystems to investigate the impact of prolonged snowmelt on stream chemistry and hydrologic flowpaths table 1 climate in the lower portion of the fourmile creek catchment is similar to the foothills catchments mean annual precipitation 500 600 mm murphy et al 2015 but due to higher winter precipitation in in the headwaters fourmile creek receives greater contributions from snowmelt land use is similar to keystone gulch with roads low density housing and underground mines though the mines are more spatially extensive lovering and goddard 1950 3 data collection and methods 3 1 precipitation data and sampling local incremental rainfall data from 1 0 mm tipping bucket rain gauges were obtained from the mile high flood district mhfd 2019 the mhfd magnolia site is the closest site to the foothill catchments and was primarily used to estimate rainfall in those catchments and both the mhfd betasso and logan mill sites were evaluated for fourmile creek fig 1 daily precipitation totals and maximum 30 min rainfall intensities i30 were calculated at all sites we used i30 because in mountainous terrain in this region most of the 1 hour rainfall falls in the first 30 min moody and martin 2001 and this metric has been used in evaluating flow response in this region murphy et al 2015 2018 maximum i30 is calculated by summing tipping bucket rainfall data within a 30 minute period and doubling the value to obtain units of mm hr moody and martin 2001 we used data from the betasso national atmospheric deposition program nadp site for concentrations of ca and mg in precipitation nadp 2019 see fig 1 for location at this site in an open canopy we deployed a sequential sampler to measure rainfall and collect multiple precipitation samples during storms but it malfunctioned subsequently we collected bulk precipitation samples for electrical conductivity ec analysis at this site the bulk precipitation sampler was washed using ultra pure deionized water di water three times before each sample collection 3 2 stream discharge and electrical conductivity continuous stream stage data were obtained at all sites except lost gulch for keystone and hawkin gulch we recorded stage every 5 min with a calibrated submerged pressure transducer model cs451 and a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc logan ut usa measured discharge weekly using a flow meter aquacalc pro jbs instruments columbus oh usa and calculated a stage discharge relationship fourmile creek discharge data 5 min interval were retrieved from the u s geological survey usgs stream gaging station fourmile creek at orodell co 06727500 located approximately 100 m upstream of its confluence with boulder creek u s geological survey usgs 2019 see fig 1 for location we did not install a pressure transducer at lost gulch due to resource constraints but measured discharge when samples were collected at all catchments runoff mm hr was calculated by dividing stream discharge by drainage area temperature corrected ec was recorded every 5 min using laboratory calibrated conductivity loggers model u24 001 onset computer corporation bourne ma usa at all sites to account for instrument data drift we calibrated ec data to weekly measurements collected with a laboratory calibrated hand held ec meter model 2052 amber science inc eugene oregon usa an instrument malfunction at fourmile creek resulted in the loss of 5 min ec data from that catchment additionally we measured ec in every water sample and selected 3 6 samples per sampled storm event for complete water chemistry analysis based on variations in discharge and ec 3 3 water sampling stream samples were collected as grab samples at all sites across the season from april 18 to august 1 table 1 approximately every week less in april and early may or until the streams stopped flowing we refer to seasonal changes throughout this paper to reflect this period of april 18 to august 1 additional grab samples were collected before and after typically within 24 hr before the start and 24 hr after the end storm events during storm events samples were collected at keystone gulch hawkin gulch and fourmile creek using automatic samplers model 6712 teledyne isco lincoln ne usa on a 15 min or 30 min interval depending on storm forecast automatic samplers were programmed to begin sampling based on rising stream stage compared to current stage previous stage behavior and future storm forecast during some storm events increases in stage were not large enough to activate the automatic samplers storm samples were not collected at lost gulch 3 4 laboratory analysis we preserved water samples

s1 all stream chemistry data are available from the boulder creek critical zone observatory database http www hydroshare org 3 5 concentration runoff relationships to investigate how hydrologic flowpaths change from early to late summer we developed linear regressions between concentration runoff c r at each site for each site c r relationships for ec sio2 ca mg na cl so4 doc and k were fitted using both grab and storm water samples combined with the formula 1 l o g c a b l o g r where a is the slope intercept b is the slope r is runoff mm hr and c is a predicted constituent concentration expressed in mg l a negative slope b 0 indicates constituent dilution where the concentrations decrease with increased discharge while a positive slope b 0 indicates enrichment where the concentrations increase with increased discharge godsey et al 2009 all data analyses was run in the r statistical package r core team 2018 3 6 hydrograph separation to infer dominant hydrologic flowpaths during storm events we used a one tracer two end member mixing model to perform hydrograph separations in keystone gulch and hawkin gulch two adjacent catchments which are similar in elevation and precipitation but differ in anthropogenic impacts for a two end member system the hydrograph separation is calculated as 2 e v e n t w a t e r f r a c t i o n t r a c e r m i x t r a c e

are end members and ec or constituents ca or mg are a tracer several conditions and assumptions must be met to perform the two end member hydrograph separation 1 only two components are contributing to stormflow during the event baseflow and event water 2 tracer values of each component are significantly different and remain constant during the event or changes are known and 3 streamwater is completely mixed and there is minimal evaporation klaus and mcdonnell 2013 wels et al 1991 after confirming that the tracer values of each component are significantly different and assuming conditions 2 and 3 were met we separated storm hydrographs into event water and pre event water contributions using ec as a tracer while ec is frequently used as a tracer in hydrograph separation studies it does not always behave conservatively in the environment laudon and slaymaker 1997 so we assessed its suitability as a conservative tracer by comparing hydrograph separation results derived using ec as a tracer to those derived using ca and mg as tracers because ec is largely controlled by major constituents such as ca and mg hydrograph separations based on either ec ca or mg should yield similar results through a quantitative comparison using linear regression we assumed that a high r2 and near one to one slope between ec and primarily bedrock derived solutes with minimal biological activity mg ca would indicate the suitability of ec as a conservative tracer if these conditions were met hydrograph separation results were obtained using ec as a tracer due to the comparatively higher temporal resolution of collection in comparison to grab sampling for ca and mg to estimate error in these hydrograph separations results from two end member hydrograph separations using ec ca and mg as tracers were compared fig s3 and table s2 we primarily used hydrograph separation results using ec as a tracer in the results and discussion we also evaluated error in the ec value of precipitation used for hydrograph separations the sequential precipitation sampler malfunctioned during some storm events and thus ec values for precipitation during individual storms were not available in addition to comparing ec derived hydrograph separations to those derived from mg and ca values three different hydrograph separations for each storm event were calculated using the average ec value two standard deviations 18 2 µs cm 20 8 µs cm and 15 6 µs cm respectively of all precipitation samples collected to investigate if the mean 18 2 µs cm is a representative precipitation ec tracer value using two standard deviations as the event ec tracer value minimally changed the results of component contributions 2 and 18 2 µs cm was exclusively used as the tracer value for event water in final hydrograph separation analysis uncertainty estimates for the final mixing model results utilizing ec as a tracer were obtained following the methodology derived by genereux 1998 following this method the standard deviation of streamflow ec measurements 48 h prior to the start of each event the standard deviation of ec in precipitation and the manufacturer s reported instrument error were propagated to estimate uncertainty for each individual sample s mixing model calculation these uncertainty estimates were then characterized by the mean median and range of uncertainty estimates for the event and pre event fractions calculated using eqs 2 and 3 4 results 4 1 precipitation during the 2018 water year october 1 2017 to september 30 2018 57 of annual precipitation fell from april

with 10 mm precipitation with the two largest events occurring on june 18 27 mm and may 2 24 mm a prolonged dry period occurred from june 20 to july 15 when 7 mm of precipitation fell in 24 days similar to previous studies in this area we observed substantial spatial variation in rainfall during summer convective storms murphy et al 2015 table s3 for example on june 18 all gages recorded 20 mm except two sites within the fourmile creek catchment logan mill and gold hill which recorded 4 mm 4 2 stream runoff runoff in all the catchments varied by several orders of magnitude during the study period with runoff generally decreasing from mid may to august fig 2 runoff values from the foothill catchments were similar to each other throughout the season ranging from 0 0005 mm hr to 0 08 mm hr and were lower than runoff of fourmile creek keystone hawkin and lost gulch had intermittent flow which ceased on july 12 july 24 and july 4 respectively and did not flow again except intermittently in response to storms during the study period runoff increased in response to storm events in all catchments the largest storm of the season june 18 caused runoff to peak at 0 08 mm hr and 0 03 mm hr at keystone gulch and hawkin gulch respectively fig 2 seasonal peak runoff at fourmile creek 0 14 mm hr occurred in response to an early season storm on may 18 4 3 seasonal times series of electrical conductivity and constituents 4 3 1 electrical conductivity ec was related to runoff and responded to storm events in all study catchments but the response differed among the catchments fig 2 in general ec was inversely related to runoff across the season being lowest in mid may during high runoff and highest in july during low runoff ec values in the three foothill catchments were similar to each other throughout the season range 126 403 μs cm mean 267 μs cm 62 sd but ec was typically lower in fourmile creek range 144 285 μs cm during the first half of the study period which coincided with snowmelt in the headwaters of fourmile creek natural resources conservation service records indicated snowmelt in upper fourmile creek began on approximately may 4 and was snow free by may 23 united states department of agriculture usda national resources conservation service nrcs 2019 fourmile creek ec increased from 187 μs cm on june 15 to 305 μs cm on july 4 approaching values of the foothill catchments after early july ec at fourmile creek increased similarly to ec at the foothill catchments for the rest of the season fig 2 during storms ec of hawkin gulch always decreased but ec in fourmile creek increased above pre storm values ec at keystone gulch decreased during all storms except during the storm runoff response on may 22 in which ec increased above pre storm ec levels 4 3 2 major cations anions and silica we observed seasonal variations in lithogenic constituent sio2 ca cl mg na so4 and k concentrations with the lowest concentrations during the spring runoff period may and the highest concentrations in june and july during low flow fig 2 the three foothill catchments had similar concentrations of sio2 ca mg and k but keystone gulch had higher concentrations of cl and na fourmile creek usually had lower concentrations of most lithogenic constituents than the foothill catchments during spring runoff but similar or higher concentrations during the low flow period of late june and july fig 2 in comparison to the foothill catchments fourmile creek always had lower sio2 concentrations and higher so4 concentrations concentrations of cl and na in keystone gulch 7 2 21 2 mg l cl 6 6 12 5 mg l na were more similar to fourmile creek 4 1 30 6 mg l cl 6 1 12 5 mg l na than to the other foothill catchments 2 2 11 3 mg l cl 5 0 8 8 mg l na at all sites no3 concentrations were typically below detection limit 105 out of 158 samples were 0 01 mg l with a maximum value of 2 2 mg l 4 3 3 dissolved organic carbon keystone gulch generally had the highest doc concentrations 3 6 14 0 mg l median 7 2 mg l 2 1 sd of all the study sites while fourmile creek had the lowest concentrations 2 5 7 0 mg l median 3 3 mg l 1 3 sd figs 2 and 3 hawkin gulch and lost gulch usually had similar doc concentrations throughout the season 1 9 8 1 mg l median 4 2 mg l 2 1 sd seasonal variations in doc were similar across all sites and doc concentrations were highest in the high runoff period early may to june during the low runoff period june to august doc concentrations generally remained constant at each catchment 6 5 mg l at keystone gulch and 3 5 mg l at the other sites 4 3 4 metals metal concentrations in all watersheds were generally low concentrations of as be cd co cr mo ni p pb sb se and w were nearly always below detection limits at all sites concentrations of fe ranged from 0 002 mg l below detection limit to 0 07 mg l in the foothill catchments fe concentrations were highest in keystone gulch mean concentration 0 021 mg l and lowest in hawkin gulch mean concentration 0 006 mg l across all sites concentrations of zn were typically low and ranged from 0 001 to 0 08 mg l mn concentrations at fourmile creek and keystone gulch were always higher ranged from 0 001 to 0 132 mg l than in lost gulch and hawkin gulch ranged from 0 001 mg l to 0 002 mg l 4 4 concentration runoff relationships c r relationships were strong r2 0 50 p 0 01 for ca mg na cl and so4 in all catchments except for cl and so4 in lost gulch fig 3 table 2 log sio2 r relationships were strong in hawkin and lost gulch r2 0 65 p 0 01 but weaker in keystone gulch and fourmile creek r2 0 35 p 0 01 relationships between runoff and k or doc were generally weaker and more variable table 2 c r relationships exhibited different slope characteristics among constituents fig 3 table 2 at all catchments the relationships between runoff and ec sio2 ca mg na cl so4 and k concentrations had negative slopes except for cl at lost gulch doc r exhibited positive slopes at all catchments except at keystone gulch where the slope was approximately zero fig 3 4 5 storm event response and hydrograph separations at the foothill catchments streamflow dynamics during storm events differed between the keystone and hawkin gulch catchments across the five sampled storm events total precipitation ranged from 3 to 38 mm maximum i30 ranged from 3 to 33 mm hr during a storm on june 18 gages in all catchments recorded an i30 15 mm hr during three of four sampled storm events keystone gulch exhibited a rapid runoff response to rainfall with a rapid 10 to 30 min time to peak and a subsequent steep recession while hawkin gulch exhibited a longer 45 65 min response table 3 figs 4 and 5 during the low intensity storm event on june 17 max i30 6 mm hr however keystone gulch and hawkin gulch both had very small and slow runoff responses during all storms keystone gulch had higher runoff peaks than hawkin gulch table 3 for example during the largest storm of the season on june 18 fig 2 runoff rates at keystone gulch and hawkin gulch peaked at 0 08 mm hr and 0 03 mm hr respectively fig 4 concentrations of sio2 ca cl and so4 in hawkin and keystone gulch generally decreased during storm events the greatest decrease occurred on june 18 within ten minutes concentrations of sio2 ca cl and so4 decreased 60 to 80 in keystone gulch and 15 30 in hawkin gulch fig 4 concentrations of doc peaked on the falling limb at 12 7 mg l in keystone gulch and 16 6 mg l in hawkin gulch lithogenic constituent concentrations increased with increased runoff during the storm events on may 22 fig s2 at keystone gulch for all storm events hawkin gulch s runoff response to rainfall was dominated by pre event water contributions event water estimates 50 table 3 in contrast event water estimates at keystone gulch peaked above 50 during three out of the four storm events and ranged from 21 on june 17 to 70 during the largest runoff event of the season on june 18 fig 5 and the timing of peak event water generally coincided with peak runoff this large dilution on june 18 coincided with the highest event water fraction 70 calculated at keystone gulch during this storm peak doc at keystone gulch occurred 80 min after peak event water contributions to streamflow while in hawkin gulch doc concentrations peaked 30 min after peak event water contributions keystone gulch had much higher doc concentrations 20 7 mg l in response to the storm on july 15 than during the larger june 18 storm 12 7 mg l this may be related to keystone gulch being completely dry before the july 15 storm calculated event water estimates using ca and mg as tracers are similar to using ec as a tracer for ca and mg linear regression r2 is 0 97 and 0 95 and slope is 0 84 and 0 86 respectively fig s3 average percent differences between using ec as a tracer versus using ca and mg were lower at hawkin gulch 14 8 than at keystone gulch 26 9 the time to peak event water was the same regardless of which tracer was used in the hydrograph separation for one storm event on may 22 at keystone gulch using ec mg or ca as tracers violated the assumption that tracer values of each component are significantly different and remain constant during the event or changes are known during all other events calculated uncertainty estimates for mixing model results utilizing ec as a tracer were relatively small with a mean uncertainty for event fractions at both catchments ranging from 0 02 to 0 06 with a mean of 0 03 uncertainty calculations for individual mixing model results and summary statistics of these calculations can be found in tables s4 and s5 5 discussion 5 1 how do hydrologic flowpaths change from early to late summer in lower elevation catchments with varying land use relations between stream runoff and water chemistry in our catchments suggest a transition in dominant flowpaths from the shallow subsurface during high flow to deeper groundwater during low flow concentrations of lithogenic e g sio2 ca mg and na constituents increased with decreasing runoff during the season while the bioactive constituent doc decreased figs 2 and 3 many studies have shown this same pattern and attributed it to a shift of flowpaths from the doc rich weathering product poor shallow subsurface to deeper flowpaths moving through bedrock or deep soil boyer et al 1997 burns et al 2016 hornberger et al 1994 chorover et al 2017 godsey et al 2009 murphy et al 2018 stallard and murphy 2014 slopes of c r relationships for sio2 ca mg and na in our catchments are shallow range 0 25 to 0 04 table 3 and similar to the near chemostatic slopes found by godsey et al 2009 in a study of 59 geochemically diverse us catchments our results differ from c r relationships of alpine and subalpine catchments in colorado which are strongly dependent on the magnitude of runoff there low flow periods tend toward chemostatic behavior while high flow periods are chemodynamic with substantial dilution of lithogenic solutes stottlemyer and troendle 1992 podzorski 2018 these higher elevation systems experience dilution of lithogenic constituents that persists into late summer early fall due to prolonged snowmelt lithogenic constituents in our catchments however were lowest in late may early june and were higher during the remainder of the summer when streamflow was low the differences between stream water chemistry and c r relationships in foothill montane catchments and subalpine alpine catchments in the colorado front range likely result from the greater contribution of seasonal snowmelt to streamflow and a longer snowmelt season at higher elevations cowie et al 2017 williams et al 2011 the average date of complete snowpack melt from water years 2008 2017 was may 31 at the subalpine niwot ridge snotel site elevation 3321 m but nearly a month earlier april 28 at montane elevation 2734 m gordon gulch united states department of agriculture usda national resources conservation service nrcs 2019 anderson and ragar 2019 in fourmile creek which extends from the foothills to the subalpine lithogenic constituent concentrations were lower from may to mid june when snowmelt derived from the subalpine region controlled stream discharge fig 2 after snowmelt waned ec and concentrations of ca and na increased approaching levels similar to those of the foothill catchments fig 2 zhang et al 2018 estimated that 24 of annual discharge in boulder creek was sourced from groundwater flow from the montane ecoregions however this estimate did not include foothills catchments and our results suggest that 24 may be an underestimate of groundwater contributions from low to mid elevation catchments williams et al 2011 observed an increase in base cation concentrations in stream water with decreasing elevation in headwater catchments in the boulder creek watershed which may also indicate greater groundwater contributions at lower elevations recent work by kampf and lefsky 2016 demonstrated that peak snow water equivalents have declined over the past three decades throughout the colorado front range if snowpack depth and snow water equivalent continue to decrease with increasing temperatures in high elevation areas catchments in the foothills and montane ecoregions may contribute not only a greater proportion of annual flow but also impact water quality with higher concentrations of lithogenic constituents water chemistry suggests that anthropogenic activities such as housing roads and historical mining affect keystone gulch and fourmile creek to a varying seasonal degree we observed high concentrations of cl in these catchments particularly during low flow conditions in the later season chloride concentration is low in the boulder creek granodiorite which underlies our study sites gable 1980 so bedrock is not a likely source in urbanized catchments high cl concentrations in streamwater are typically linked to a combination of both effluent from local septic systems and long term road salt application sherwood 1989 gutchess et al 2016 kelly et al 2008 stets et al 2018 several residences with domestic sewage systems are located adjacent to the stream channel in both keystone gulch and fourmile creek and may contribute cl to the groundwater system the u s natural resource conservation service nrcs assessed the soils in these areas to be very limited for septic use which suggests that less effective performance of septic systems may be expected soil survey staff natural resources conservation service united states department of agriculture usda 2020 thus it is possible that wastewater which can be elevated in chloride gutchess et al 2016 may be contributing to nearby streams in addition boulder county applies a mixture of sand and 5 10 rock salt nacl to roads that parallel keystone gulch and fourmile creek boulder county 2019 and it is possible that cl enters local groundwater and is transported to streams kelly et al 2008 ledford et al 2016 perera et al 2013 sherwood 1989 residence times of cl in altered groundwater systems has been estimated to range from 20 to 30 years gutchess et al 2016 to hundreds and thousands of years novotny et al 2009 highlighting a potential long term impact of land use change on stream chemistry in the colorado front range elevated so4 concentrations in fourmile creek may be related to the presence of widespread historical underground mines in this catchment minimal so4 is present in boulder creek granodiorite which underlies most of our study area gable 1980 but pyrite is present in ore deposits in the fourmile creek catchment lovering and goddard 1950 plumlee et al 1995 and oxidation of pyrite can lead to elevated so4 in waters downstream of mines nordstrom 2011 2009 indeed mine discharge in the fourmile creek catchment which is derived from deeper flowpaths through abandoned subsurface mine workings murphy et al 2020 contains elevated so4 mccleskey et al 2012 murphy et al 2020b during spring snowmelt runoff derived from the upstream subalpine region provides dilution of the stream keystone gulch also contains historical underground mines but we did not observe high concentrations of so4 in that catchment in contrast to the ore in fourmile creek the telluride ore mined in keystone gulch has limited pyrite plumlee et al 1995 and the mines are less spatially extensive while flowpaths in keystone gulch may also intersect historical mines the resultant mine discharge would likely have low so4 concentrations limitations on property access prevented us from sampling of mine discharge in keystone gulch despite the presence of mines in both of these watersheds metal concentrations were generally low and can be attributed to the type of ore deposit in both plumlee et al 1995 other studies have suggested that atmospheric deposition is a considerable source of both cl and so4 to montane and foothills catchments in the boulder creek watershed aguirre et al 2017 mills 2016 but the reported deposition and stream fluxes do not fully explain the patterns we observed in our catchments dust deposition in the montane foothills region is greatest during the early summer months with the highest rates being between the months of may and july aguirre et al 2017 heindel et al 2020 however cl and so4 concentrations in our streams became more dilute during these months and only increased late in the summer out of phase with seasonal deposition patterns in nearby montane gordon gulch cl and so4 concentrations were variable yet consistently higher in streamwater than in groundwater concentrations in groundwater remained relatively constant throughout the year but stream concentrations became more enriched in response to summer rain events especially in the late fall following prolonged dry periods mills 2016 concentrations of so4 and cl in streamwater increased in response to a large rain event in late june in fourmile creek and keystone gulch respectively fig 2 but this response was not consistent among all catchments or across all rain events as would be expected if atmospheric deposition was the primary driver for so4 and cl enrichment in streams in addition peak so4 and cl concentrations in fourmile creek and keystone gulch stream water during our study were 10 times greater than those observed in gordon gulch over a three year period mills 2016 therefore while atmospheric deposition may contribute to so4 and cl to some degree in our catchments it is likely a small fraction 5 2 what are the dominant flowpaths during summer storm events in foothill catchments comparing the timing and magnitude of peak event water fractions hydrograph and constituent behavior indicated dominant flowpaths during storm events differed between keystone gulch and hawkin gulch peak event water estimates at hawkin gulch table 3 the largely undisturbed foothills catchment were consistent with past studies where storm hydrographs are dominated by pre event water contributions brown et al 1999 buttle 1994 buttle and peters 1997 marc et al 2001 genereux and hooper 2012 gibson et al 2005 hoeg et al 2000 hooper and shoemaker 1986 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 sklash et al 1979 event water contributions typically peaked on the falling limb indicating that substantial volumes of event water were delivered to hawkin gulch after peak runoff concentrations of doc and lithogenic constituents were highest and lowest respectively on the falling limb suggesting that this event water traveled through shallow subsurface flowpaths intersecting doc rich soils boyer et al 1997 hornberger et al 1994 mcdowell and likens 1988 mcglynn et al 1999 mills 2016 in contrast keystone gulch the foothill catchment with anthropogenic disturbances had peak event water contributions 50 that coincided with peak or near peak runoff and low doc and lithogenic constituent concentrations this suggests the rapid pulse of event water at keystone gulch is likely not delivered through shallow subsurface flowpaths klaus et al 2013 mcdonnell 1990 or overland flowpaths over soils both of which are typically rich in doc gremillion et al 2000 pearce 1990 we posit that overland flow that bypasses both doc and lithogenic constituents is the primary contributor of event water contributions at keystone gulch although overland flow across impervious surfaces has been shown to flush accumulated doc on roads and pavement into streams during storm events aitkenhead peterson et al 2009 hook and yeakley 2005 wise et al 2019 these studies were in highly urbanized watersheds with more traffic intensive roads relative to keystone gulch keystone gulch has low density low intensity trafficked roads and it is possible that flowpaths across impervious surfaces in keystone gulch have low doc concentrations another possible explanation for the large pulse of event water at keystone gulch is overland flow across several near stream rock outcrops upstream of our sampling point rock outcrop complexes make up approximately 14 of the area of keystone gulch and are concentrated near the stream outlet and along an ephemeral tributary in the upper portion of the catchment u s geological survey usgs 2020 at the panola mountain research watershed in georgia burns et al 2001 showed constituent dilute water was sourced from upstream rock outcrops and dominated peak runoff during storm responses however with our current data set the precise mechanism for the quick delivery of event water at keystone gulch cannot be definitively determined 6 conclusion this research contributes to a broader understanding of current streamflow generating processes in foothill catchments of the western us and provides a baseline from which future climatic variability and disturbances to such catchments may be assessed we found that lithogenic constituent concentrations in foothill catchments increased throughout the summer and showed less seasonal variation than higher elevation catchments due to relatively lower snowmelt contribution event water contributions in a disturbed catchment e g housing and road development were higher than event water contributions in a neighboring catchment with no disturbances the presence of higher cl concentrations in the disturbed catchments suggest that road salt or septic systems may be affecting stream chemistry while the presence of higher so4 in one of the mined catchments but not the other may be related to ore type and or spatial extent of mines our results highlight the importance of considering different components of land use in the wildland urban interface when investigating stream chemistry and runoff generation processes in the context of future development our findings have implications for predicting future changes in stream chemistry and hydrology in

4827,climatic shifts disturbances and land use change can alter hydrologic flowpaths water quality and water supply to downstream communities prior research investigating streamflow generation processes in mountainous areas has largely focused on high elevation alpine and subalpine catchments less is known about these processes in lower elevation foothills and montane catchments in these lower elevation ecoregions precipitation shifts seasonally from snow to rain which can result in differing seasonal flowpaths we analyzed stream water for electrical conductivity sio2 ca mg na cl so4 k and dissolved organic carbon on both a weekly and storm event basis from april to august 2018 in three small 10 km2 foothill catchments and one larger 63 2 km2 catchment extending from the foothills to the subalpine ecoregions in the colorado front range using two end member hydrograph separations and concentration runoff relationships we inferred the dominant catchment scale flowpaths of precipitation to the streams we selected catchments with varying land use to investigate the relationship between these characteristics and hydrologic flowpaths we observed that concentrations of lithogenic constituents generally increased and dissolved organic carbon decreased as seasonal runoff decreased in the three foothill catchments reflecting a transition from shallow subsurface flowpaths to deeper subsurface flowpaths elevated so4 and cl concentrations during low flow periods in two of our catchments suggest that historical or current anthropogenic activities such as mining application of road salt and or near stream septic systems affect local stream and groundwater chemistry in a foothill catchment with anthropogenic and geologic impervious surfaces streamflow during storm responses was sourced from faster surficial flowpaths compared to a less disturbed neighboring catchment highlighting the influence of anthropogenic land use on runoff generation this study

santos et al 2014 sklash et al 1979 the overarching goal of this study is to advance our limited knowledge of how lower elevation mountainous catchments function in the semi arid colorado front range our approach examines catchments with and without anthropogenic impacts such as mining and low density housing as well as catchments that vary in the proportion of annual precipitation inputs i e snow vs rain given that these ecoregions are experiencing trends towards greater rainfall contributions to peak flows kampf and lefsky 2016 we conducted our study in the summer to investigate rain driven processes we address the following research questions what are the dominant flowpaths in lower elevation catchments with varying land use during summer storm events as inferred by hydrometrics and stream chemistry and how do hydrologic flowpaths in these catchments change from early to late summer we address these questions by performing hydrograph separations investigating stream chemistry and runoff behavior during storm events and analyzing the relationship between constituent concentrations and runoff 2 study area we conducted our study in the boulder creek watershed 1 160 km2 located in the colorado front range fig 1 the watershed spans an elevation gradient from 1 480 to 4 120 m and can be divided into five major climatic zones ecoregions plains 1 450 1 800 m foothill 1800 2400 m montane 2400 2700 m subalpine 2700 3500 m and alpine 3500 4200 m murphy 2006 excluding the plains ecoregion which is downstream of our study area the foothill and montane ecoregions comprise 58 of the watershed and the subalpine and alpine regions comprise 42 the foothill regions are underlain by precambrian metamorphic and granitic bedrock predominately gneiss and schist the subalpine regions contain those rock types and also minimal tertiary volcanics and quaternary alluvium deposits see figure in murphy 2006 p 4 summer mid june through mid september precipitation is characterized by convective thunderstorms with substantial spatial variation in rainfall the majority of precipitation in the subalpine and alpine regions is delivered as snow in the winter and spring while in the montane and foothills ecoregions annual precipitation is 30 60 snow 25 40 rain and 15 30 mixed snow and rain that is air temperature crossed 2 c during the event cowie 2010 lower elevations in the boulder creek watershed receive a greater percentage of precipitation in april september than do higher elevations e g the plains receive about 65 of precipitation during that time compared to the subalpine receiving about 53 during that time murphy et al 2015 table s5 highest runoff in boulder creek typically occurs from april june from snowmelt and mixed rain snow events and annual low flow occurs from september to march murphy 2006 we compared three catchments in the foothill and lower montane ecoregions of the watershed keystone gulch hawkin gulch and lost gulch fig 1 these foothill

and east facing slopes are typically dominated by more shade tolerant rocky mountain douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii var glauca and colorado blue spruce picea pungens with few aspen populus tremuloides kaufmann et al 2006 most of hawkin gulch and upper portions of keystone gulch are boulder county designated environmental conservation areas keystone gulch has considerably more anthropogenic impacts than hawkin or lost gulch including low density housing and a low intensity trafficked paved road that extends the entire elevation range of the catchment keystone gulch also contains 38 historical underground hard rock mines which are primarily located within a 3 km2 radius and have tunnels that are typically 100 m long lovering and goddard 1950 we compared the three foothills catchments to the larger 63 2 km2 fourmile creek catchment which extends from the foothills to subalpine ecosystems to investigate the impact of prolonged snowmelt on stream chemistry and hydrologic flowpaths table 1 climate in the lower portion of the fourmile creek catchment is similar to the foothills catchments mean annual precipitation 500 600 mm murphy et al 2015 but due to higher winter precipitation in in the headwaters fourmile creek receives greater contributions from snowmelt land use is similar to keystone gulch with roads low density housing and underground mines though the mines are more spatially extensive lovering and goddard 1950 3 data collection and methods 3 1 precipitation data and sampling local incremental rainfall data from 1 0 mm tipping bucket rain gauges were obtained from the mile high flood district mhfd 2019 the mhfd magnolia site is the closest site to the foothill catchments and was primarily used to estimate rainfall in those catchments and both the mhfd betasso and logan mill sites were evaluated for fourmile creek fig 1 daily precipitation totals and maximum 30 min rainfall intensities i30 were calculated at all sites we used i30 because in mountainous terrain in this region most of the 1 hour rainfall falls in the first 30 min moody and martin 2001 and this metric has been used in evaluating flow response in this region murphy et al 2015 2018 maximum i30 is calculated by summing tipping bucket rainfall data within a 30 minute period and doubling the value to obtain units of mm hr moody and martin 2001 we used data from the betasso national atmospheric deposition program nadp site for concentrations of ca and mg in precipitation nadp 2019 see fig 1 for location at this site in an open canopy we deployed a sequential sampler to measure rainfall and collect multiple precipitation samples during storms but it malfunctioned subsequently we collected bulk precipitation samples for electrical conductivity ec analysis at this site the bulk precipitation sampler was washed using ultra pure deionized water di water three times before each sample collection 3 2 stream discharge and electrical conductivity continuous stream stage data were obtained at all sites except lost gulch for keystone and hawkin gulch we recorded stage every 5 min with a calibrated submerged pressure transducer model cs451 and a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc logan ut usa measured discharge weekly using a flow meter aquacalc pro jbs instruments columbus oh usa and calculated a stage discharge relationship fourmile creek discharge data 5 min interval were retrieved from the u s geological survey usgs stream gaging station fourmile creek at orodell co 06727500 located approximately 100 m upstream of its confluence with boulder creek u s geological survey usgs 2019 see fig 1 for location we did not install a pressure transducer at lost gulch due to resource constraints but measured discharge when samples were collected at all catchments runoff mm hr was calculated by dividing stream discharge by drainage area temperature corrected ec was recorded every 5 min using laboratory calibrated conductivity loggers model u24 001 onset computer corporation bourne ma usa at all sites to account for instrument data drift we calibrated ec data to weekly measurements collected with a laboratory calibrated hand held ec meter model 2052 amber science inc eugene oregon usa an instrument malfunction at fourmile creek resulted in the loss of 5 min ec data from that catchment additionally we measured ec in every water sample and selected 3 6 samples per sampled storm event for complete water chemistry analysis based on variations in discharge and ec 3 3 water sampling stream samples were collected as grab samples at all sites across the season from april 18 to august 1 table 1 approximately every week less in april and early may or until the streams stopped flowing we refer to seasonal changes throughout this paper to reflect this period of april 18 to august 1 additional grab samples were collected before and after typically within 24 hr before the start and 24 hr after the end storm events during storm events samples were collected at keystone gulch hawkin gulch and fourmile creek using automatic samplers model 6712 teledyne isco lincoln ne usa on a 15 min or 30 min interval depending on storm forecast automatic samplers were programmed to begin sampling based on rising stream stage compared to current stage previous stage behavior and future storm forecast during some storm events increases in stage were not large enough to activate the automatic samplers storm samples were not collected at lost gulch 3 4 laboratory analysis we preserved water samples following standard techniques of cooling filtering and acidifying samples for laboratory analysis mccleskey et al 2012 stream water samples were analyzed for major cations and anions doc metals al as b ba be cd co cr cu fe li mn mo ni p pb sb se sr u v w zn ec and ph precipitation samples were analyzed for ec refer to the si for details on laboratory analytical methods precision and accuracy table s1 all stream chemistry data are available from the boulder creek critical zone observatory database http www hydroshare org 3 5 concentration runoff relationships to investigate how hydrologic flowpaths change from early to late summer we developed linear regressions between concentration runoff c r at each site for each site c r relationships for ec sio2 ca mg na cl so4 doc and k were fitted using both grab and storm water samples combined with the formula 1 l o g c a b l o g r where a is the slope intercept b is the slope r is runoff mm hr and c is a predicted constituent concentration expressed in mg l a negative slope b 0 indicates constituent dilution where the concentrations decrease with increased discharge while a positive slope b 0 indicates enrichment where the concentrations increase with increased discharge godsey et al 2009 all data analyses was run in the r statistical package r core team 2018 3 6 hydrograph separation to infer dominant hydrologic flowpaths during storm events we used a one tracer two end member mixing model to perform hydrograph separations in keystone gulch and hawkin gulch two adjacent catchments which are similar in elevation and precipitation but differ in anthropogenic impacts for a two end member system the hydrograph separation is calculated as 2 e v e n t w a t e r f r a c t i o n t r a c e r m i x t r a c e r p r e e v e n t t r a c e r e v e n t t r a c e r p r e e v e n t 3 p r e e v e n t f r a c t i o n 1 e v e n t w a t e r f r a c t i o n where pre event water baseflow and event water precipitation are end members and ec or constituents ca or mg are a tracer several conditions and assumptions must be met to perform the two end member hydrograph separation 1 only two components are contributing to stormflow during the event baseflow and event water 2 tracer values of each component are significantly different and remain constant during the event or changes are known and 3 streamwater is completely mixed and there is minimal evaporation klaus and mcdonnell 2013 wels et al 1991 after confirming that the tracer values of each component are significantly different and assuming conditions 2 and 3 were met we separated storm hydrographs into event water and pre event water contributions using ec as a tracer while ec is frequently used as a tracer in hydrograph separation studies it does not always behave conservatively in the environment laudon and slaymaker 1997 so we assessed its suitability as a conservative tracer by comparing hydrograph separation results derived using ec as a tracer to those derived using ca and mg as tracers because ec is largely controlled by major constituents such as ca and mg hydrograph separations based on either ec ca or mg should yield similar results through a quantitative comparison using linear regression we assumed that a high r2 and near one to one slope between ec and primarily bedrock derived solutes with minimal biological activity mg ca would indicate the suitability of ec as a conservative tracer if these conditions were met hydrograph separation results were obtained using ec as a tracer due to the comparatively higher temporal resolution of collection in comparison to grab sampling for ca and mg to estimate error in these hydrograph separations results from two end member hydrograph separations using ec ca and mg as tracers were compared fig s3 and table s2 we primarily used hydrograph separation results using ec as a tracer in the results and discussion we also evaluated error in the ec value of precipitation used for hydrograph separations the sequential precipitation sampler malfunctioned during some storm events and thus ec values for precipitation during individual storms were not available in addition to comparing ec derived hydrograph separations to those derived from mg and ca values three different hydrograph separations for each storm event were calculated using the average ec value two standard deviations 18 2 µs cm 20 8 µs cm and 15 6 µs cm respectively of all precipitation samples collected to investigate if the mean 18 2 µs cm is a representative precipitation ec tracer value using two standard deviations as the event ec tracer value minimally changed the results of component contributions 2 and 18 2 µs cm was exclusively used as the tracer value for event water in final hydrograph separation analysis uncertainty estimates for the final mixing model results utilizing ec as a tracer were obtained following the methodology derived by genereux 1998 following this method the standard deviation of streamflow ec measurements 48 h prior to the start of each event the standard deviation of ec in precipitation and the manufacturer s reported instrument error were propagated to estimate uncertainty for each individual sample s mixing model calculation these uncertainty estimates were then characterized by the mean median and range of uncertainty estimates for the event and pre event fractions calculated using eqs 2 and 3 4 results 4 1 precipitation during the 2018 water year october 1 2017 to september 30 2018 57 of annual precipitation fell from april through july near our field catchments at the betasso nadp site fig 1 with the highest monthly precipitation totals occurring in may 129 mm and june 60 mm fig s1 in may and june there were ten storms with 10 mm precipitation with the two largest events occurring on june 18 27 mm and may 2 24 mm a prolonged dry period occurred from june 20 to july 15 when 7 mm of precipitation fell in 24 days similar to previous studies in this area we observed substantial spatial variation in rainfall during summer convective storms murphy et al 2015 table s3 for example on june 18 all gages recorded 20 mm except two sites within the fourmile creek catchment logan mill and gold hill which recorded 4 mm 4 2 stream runoff runoff in all the catchments varied by several orders of magnitude during the study period with runoff generally decreasing from mid may to august fig 2 runoff values from the foothill catchments were similar to each other throughout the season ranging from 0 0005 mm hr to 0 08 mm hr and were lower than runoff of fourmile creek keystone hawkin and lost gulch had intermittent flow which ceased on july 12 july 24 and july 4 respectively and did not flow again except intermittently in response to storms during the study period runoff increased in response to storm events in all catchments the largest storm of the season june 18 caused runoff to peak at 0 08 mm hr and 0 03 mm hr at keystone gulch and hawkin gulch respectively fig 2 seasonal peak runoff at fourmile creek 0 14 mm hr occurred in response to an early season storm on may 18 4 3 seasonal times series of electrical conductivity and constituents 4 3 1 electrical conductivity ec was related to runoff and responded to storm events in all study catchments but the response differed among the catchments fig 2 in general ec was inversely related to runoff across the season being lowest in mid may during high runoff and highest in july during low runoff ec values in the three foothill catchments were similar to each other throughout the season range 126 403 μs cm mean 267 μs cm 62 sd but ec was typically lower in fourmile creek range 144 285 μs cm during the first half of the study period which coincided with snowmelt in the headwaters of fourmile creek natural resources conservation service records indicated snowmelt in upper fourmile creek began on approximately may 4 and was snow free by may 23 united states department of agriculture usda national resources conservation service nrcs 2019 fourmile creek ec increased from 187 μs cm on june 15 to 305 μs cm on july 4 approaching values of the foothill catchments after early july ec at fourmile creek increased similarly to ec at the foothill catchments for the rest of the season fig 2 during storms ec of hawkin gulch always decreased but ec in fourmile creek increased above pre storm values ec at keystone gulch decreased during all storms except during the storm runoff response on may 22 in which ec increased above pre storm ec levels 4 3 2 major cations anions and silica we observed seasonal variations in lithogenic constituent sio2 ca cl mg na so4 and k concentrations with the lowest concentrations during the spring runoff period may and the highest concentrations in june and july during low flow fig 2 the three foothill catchments had similar concentrations of sio2 ca mg and k but keystone gulch had higher concentrations of cl and na fourmile creek usually had lower concentrations of most lithogenic constituents than the foothill catchments during spring runoff but similar or higher concentrations during the low flow period of late june and july fig 2 in comparison to the foothill catchments fourmile creek always had lower sio2 concentrations and higher so4 concentrations concentrations of cl and na in keystone gulch 7 2 21 2 mg l cl 6 6 12 5 mg l na were more similar to fourmile creek 4 1 30 6 mg l cl 6 1 12 5 mg l na than to the other foothill catchments 2 2 11 3 mg l cl 5 0 8 8 mg l na at all sites no3 concentrations were typically below detection limit 105 out of 158 samples were 0 01 mg l with a maximum value of 2 2 mg l 4 3 3 dissolved organic carbon keystone gulch generally had the highest doc concentrations 3 6 14 0 mg l median 7 2 mg l 2 1 sd of all the study sites while fourmile creek had the lowest concentrations 2 5 7 0 mg l median 3 3 mg l 1 3 sd figs 2 and 3 hawkin gulch and lost gulch usually had similar doc concentrations throughout the season 1 9 8 1 mg l median 4 2 mg l 2 1 sd seasonal variations in doc were similar across all sites and doc concentrations were highest in the high runoff period early may to june during the low runoff period june to august doc concentrations generally remained constant at each catchment 6 5 mg l at keystone gulch and 3 5 mg l at the other sites 4 3 4 metals metal concentrations in all watersheds were generally low concentrations of as be cd co cr mo ni p pb sb se and w were nearly always below detection limits at all sites concentrations of fe ranged from 0 002 mg l below detection limit to 0 07 mg l in the foothill catchments fe concentrations were highest in keystone gulch mean concentration 0 021 mg l and lowest in hawkin gulch mean concentration 0 006 mg l across all sites concentrations of zn were typically low and ranged from 0 001 to 0 08 mg l mn concentrations at fourmile creek and keystone gulch were always higher ranged from 0 001 to 0 132 mg l than in lost gulch and hawkin gulch ranged from 0 001 mg l to 0 002 mg l 4 4 concentration runoff relationships c r relationships were strong r2 0 50 p 0 01 for ca mg na cl and so4 in all catchments except for cl and so4 in lost gulch fig 3 table 2 log sio2 r relationships were strong in hawkin and lost gulch r2 0 65 p 0 01 but weaker in keystone gulch and fourmile creek r2 0 35 p 0 01 relationships between runoff and k or doc were generally weaker and more variable table 2 c r relationships exhibited different slope characteristics among constituents fig 3 table 2 at all catchments the relationships between runoff and ec sio2 ca mg na cl so4 and k concentrations had negative slopes except for cl at lost gulch doc r exhibited positive slopes at all catchments except at keystone gulch where the slope was approximately zero fig 3 4 5 storm event response and hydrograph separations at the foothill catchments streamflow dynamics during storm events differed between the keystone and hawkin gulch catchments across the five sampled storm events total precipitation ranged from 3 to 38 mm maximum i30 ranged from 3 to 33 mm hr during a storm on june 18 gages in all catchments recorded an i30 15 mm hr during three of four sampled storm events keystone gulch exhibited a rapid runoff response to rainfall with a rapid 10 to 30 min time to peak and a subsequent steep recession while hawkin gulch exhibited a longer 45 65 min response table 3 figs 4 and 5 during the low intensity storm event on june 17 max i30 6 mm hr however keystone gulch and hawkin gulch both had very small and slow runoff responses during all storms keystone gulch had higher runoff peaks than hawkin gulch table 3 for example during the largest storm of the season on june 18 fig 2 runoff rates at keystone gulch and hawkin gulch peaked at 0 08 mm hr and 0 03 mm hr respectively fig 4 concentrations of sio2 ca cl and so4 in hawkin and keystone gulch generally decreased during storm events the greatest decrease occurred on june 18 within ten minutes concentrations of sio2 ca cl and so4 decreased 60 to 80 in keystone gulch and 15 30 in hawkin gulch fig 4 concentrations of doc peaked on the falling limb at 12 7 mg l in keystone gulch and 16 6 mg l in hawkin gulch lithogenic constituent concentrations increased with increased runoff during the storm events on may 22 fig s2 at keystone gulch for all storm events hawkin gulch s runoff response to rainfall was dominated by pre event water contributions event water estimates 50 table 3 in contrast event water estimates at keystone gulch peaked above 50 during three out of the four storm events and ranged from 21 on june 17 to 70 during the largest runoff event of the season on june 18 fig 5 and the timing of peak event water generally coincided with peak runoff this large dilution on june 18 coincided with the highest event water fraction 70 calculated at keystone gulch during this storm peak doc at keystone gulch occurred 80 min after peak event water contributions to streamflow while in hawkin gulch doc concentrations peaked 30 min after peak event water contributions keystone gulch had much higher doc concentrations 20 7 mg l in response to the storm on july 15 than during the larger june 18 storm 12 7 mg l this may be related to keystone gulch being completely dry before the july 15 storm calculated event water estimates using ca and mg as tracers are similar to using ec as a tracer for ca and mg linear regression r2 is 0 97 and 0 95 and slope is 0 84 and 0 86 respectively fig s3 average percent differences between using ec as a tracer versus using ca and mg were lower at hawkin gulch 14 8 than at keystone gulch 26 9 the time to peak event water was the same regardless of which tracer was used in the hydrograph separation for one storm event on may 22 at keystone gulch using ec mg or ca as tracers violated the assumption that tracer values of each component are significantly different and remain constant during the event or changes are known during all other events calculated uncertainty estimates for mixing model results utilizing ec as a tracer were relatively small with a mean uncertainty for event fractions at both catchments ranging from 0 02 to 0 06 with a mean of 0 03 uncertainty calculations for individual mixing model results and summary statistics of these calculations can be found in tables s4 and s5 5 discussion 5 1 how do hydrologic flowpaths change from early to late summer in lower elevation catchments with varying land use relations between stream runoff and water chemistry in our catchments suggest a transition in dominant flowpaths from the shallow subsurface during high flow to deeper groundwater during low flow concentrations of lithogenic e g sio2 ca mg and na constituents increased with decreasing runoff during the season while the bioactive constituent doc decreased figs 2 and 3 many studies have shown this same pattern and attributed it to a shift of flowpaths from the doc rich weathering product poor shallow subsurface to deeper flowpaths moving through bedrock or deep soil boyer et al 1997 burns et al 2016 hornberger et al 1994 chorover et al 2017 godsey et al 2009 murphy et al 2018 stallard and murphy 2014 slopes of c r relationships for sio2 ca mg and na in our catchments are shallow range 0 25 to 0 04 table 3 and similar to the near chemostatic slopes found by godsey et al 2009 in a study of 59 geochemically diverse us catchments our results differ from c r relationships of alpine and subalpine catchments in colorado which are strongly dependent on the magnitude of runoff there low flow periods tend toward chemostatic behavior while high flow periods are chemodynamic with substantial dilution of lithogenic solutes stottlemyer and troendle 1992 podzorski 2018 these higher elevation systems experience dilution of lithogenic constituents that persists into late summer early fall due to prolonged snowmelt lithogenic constituents in our catchments however were lowest in late may early june and were higher during the remainder of the summer when streamflow was low the differences between stream water chemistry and c r relationships in foothill montane catchments and subalpine alpine catchments in the colorado front range likely result from the greater contribution of seasonal snowmelt to streamflow and a longer snowmelt season at higher elevations cowie et al 2017 williams et al 2011 the average date of complete snowpack melt from water years 2008 2017 was may 31 at the subalpine niwot ridge snotel site elevation 3321 m but nearly a month earlier april 28 at montane elevation 2734 m gordon gulch united states department of agriculture usda national resources conservation service nrcs 2019 anderson and ragar 2019 in fourmile creek which extends from the foothills to the subalpine lithogenic constituent concentrations were lower from may to mid june when snowmelt derived from the subalpine region controlled stream discharge fig 2 after snowmelt waned ec and concentrations of ca and na increased approaching levels similar to those of the foothill catchments fig 2 zhang et al 2018 estimated that 24 of annual discharge in boulder creek was sourced from groundwater flow from the montane ecoregions however this estimate did not include foothills catchments and our results suggest that 24 may be an underestimate of groundwater contributions from low to mid elevation catchments williams et al 2011 observed an increase in base cation concentrations in stream water with decreasing elevation in headwater catchments in the boulder creek watershed which may also indicate greater groundwater contributions at lower elevations recent work by kampf and lefsky 2016 demonstrated that peak snow water equivalents have declined over the past three decades throughout the colorado front range if snowpack depth and snow water equivalent continue to decrease with increasing temperatures in high elevation areas catchments in the foothills and montane ecoregions may contribute not only a greater proportion of annual flow but also impact water quality with higher concentrations of lithogenic constituents water chemistry suggests that anthropogenic activities such as housing roads and historical mining affect keystone gulch and fourmile creek to a varying seasonal degree we observed high concentrations of cl in these catchments particularly during low flow conditions in the later season chloride concentration is low in the boulder creek granodiorite which underlies our study sites gable 1980 so bedrock is not a likely source in urbanized catchments high cl concentrations in streamwater are typically linked to a combination of both effluent from local septic systems and long term road salt application sherwood 1989 gutchess et al 2016 kelly et al 2008 stets et al 2018 several residences with domestic sewage systems are located adjacent to the stream channel in both keystone gulch and fourmile creek and may contribute cl to the groundwater system the u s natural resource conservation service nrcs assessed the soils in these areas to be very limited for septic use which suggests that less effective performance of septic systems may be expected soil survey staff natural resources conservation service united states department of agriculture usda 2020 thus it is possible that wastewater which can be elevated in chloride gutchess et al 2016 may be contributing to nearby streams in addition boulder county applies a mixture of sand and 5 10 rock salt nacl to roads that parallel keystone gulch and fourmile creek boulder county 2019 and it is possible that cl enters local groundwater and is transported to streams kelly et al 2008 ledford et al 2016 perera et al 2013 sherwood 1989 residence times of cl in altered groundwater systems has been estimated to range from 20 to 30 years gutchess et al 2016 to hundreds and thousands of years novotny et al 2009 highlighting a potential long term impact of land use change on stream chemistry in the colorado front range elevated so4 concentrations in fourmile creek may be related to the presence of widespread historical underground mines in this catchment minimal so4 is present in boulder creek granodiorite which underlies most of our study area gable 1980 but pyrite is present in ore deposits in the fourmile creek catchment lovering and goddard 1950 plumlee et al 1995 and oxidation of pyrite can lead to elevated so4 in waters downstream of mines nordstrom 2011 2009 indeed mine discharge in the fourmile creek catchment which is derived from deeper flowpaths through abandoned subsurface mine workings murphy et al 2020 contains elevated so4 mccleskey et al 2012 murphy et al 2020b during spring snowmelt runoff derived from the upstream subalpine region provides dilution of the stream keystone gulch also contains historical underground mines but we did not observe high concentrations of so4 in that catchment in contrast to the ore in fourmile creek the telluride ore mined in keystone gulch has limited pyrite plumlee et al 1995 and the mines are less spatially extensive while flowpaths in keystone gulch may also intersect historical mines the resultant mine discharge would likely have low so4 concentrations limitations on property access prevented us from sampling of mine discharge in keystone gulch despite the presence of mines in both of these watersheds metal concentrations were generally low and can be attributed to the type of ore deposit in both plumlee et al 1995 other studies have suggested that atmospheric deposition is a considerable source of both cl and so4 to montane and foothills catchments in the boulder creek watershed aguirre et al 2017 mills 2016 but the reported deposition and stream fluxes do not fully explain the patterns we observed in our catchments dust deposition in the montane foothills region is greatest during the early summer months with the highest rates being between the months of may and july aguirre et al 2017 heindel et al 2020 however cl and so4 concentrations in our streams became more dilute during these months and only increased late in the summer out of phase with seasonal deposition patterns in nearby montane gordon gulch cl and so4 concentrations were variable yet consistently higher in streamwater than in groundwater concentrations in groundwater remained relatively constant throughout the year but stream concentrations became more enriched in response to summer rain events especially in the late fall following prolonged dry periods mills 2016 concentrations of so4 and cl in streamwater increased in response to a large rain event in late june in fourmile creek and keystone gulch respectively fig 2 but this response was not consistent among all catchments or across all rain events as would be expected if atmospheric deposition was the primary driver for so4 and cl enrichment in streams in addition peak so4 and cl concentrations in fourmile creek and keystone gulch stream water during our study were 10 times greater than those observed in gordon gulch over a three year period mills 2016 therefore while atmospheric deposition may contribute to so4 and cl to some degree in our catchments it is likely a small fraction 5 2 what are the dominant flowpaths during summer storm events in foothill catchments comparing the timing and magnitude of peak event water fractions hydrograph and constituent behavior indicated dominant flowpaths during storm events differed between keystone gulch and hawkin gulch peak event water estimates at hawkin gulch table 3 the largely undisturbed foothills catchment were consistent with past studies where storm hydrographs are dominated by pre event water contributions brown et al 1999 buttle 1994 buttle and peters 1997 marc et al 2001 genereux and hooper 2012 gibson et al 2005 hoeg et al 2000 hooper and shoemaker 1986 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 sklash et al 1979 event water contributions typically peaked on the falling limb indicating that substantial volumes of event water were delivered to hawkin gulch after peak runoff concentrations of doc and lithogenic constituents were highest and lowest respectively on the falling limb suggesting that this event water traveled through shallow subsurface flowpaths intersecting doc rich soils boyer et al 1997 hornberger et al 1994 mcdowell and likens 1988 mcglynn et al 1999 mills 2016 in contrast keystone gulch the foothill catchment with anthropogenic disturbances had peak event water contributions 50 that coincided with peak or near peak runoff and low doc and lithogenic constituent concentrations this suggests the rapid pulse of event water at keystone gulch is likely not delivered through shallow subsurface flowpaths klaus et al 2013 mcdonnell 1990 or overland flowpaths over soils both of which are typically rich in doc gremillion et al 2000 pearce 1990 we posit that overland flow that bypasses both doc and lithogenic constituents is the primary contributor of event water contributions at keystone gulch although overland flow across impervious surfaces has been shown to flush accumulated doc on roads and pavement into streams during storm events aitkenhead peterson et al 2009 hook and yeakley 2005 wise et al 2019 these studies were in highly urbanized watersheds with more traffic intensive roads relative to keystone gulch keystone gulch has low density low intensity trafficked roads and it is possible that flowpaths across impervious surfaces in keystone gulch have low doc concentrations another possible explanation for the large pulse of event water at keystone gulch is overland flow across several near stream rock outcrops upstream of our sampling point rock outcrop complexes make up approximately 14 of the area of keystone gulch and are concentrated near the stream outlet and along an ephemeral tributary in the upper portion of the catchment u s geological survey usgs 2020 at the panola mountain research watershed in georgia burns et al 2001 showed constituent dilute water was sourced from upstream rock outcrops and dominated peak runoff during storm responses however with our current data set the precise mechanism for the quick delivery of event water at keystone gulch cannot be definitively determined 6 conclusion this research contributes to a broader understanding of current streamflow generating processes in foothill catchments of the western us and provides a baseline from which future climatic variability and disturbances to such catchments may be assessed we found that lithogenic constituent concentrations in foothill catchments increased throughout the summer and showed less seasonal variation than higher elevation catchments due to relatively lower snowmelt contribution event water contributions in a disturbed catchment e g housing and road development were higher than event water contributions in a neighboring catchment with no disturbances the presence of higher cl concentrations in the disturbed catchments suggest that road salt or septic systems may be affecting stream chemistry while the presence of higher so4 in one of the mined catchments but not the other may be related to ore type and or spatial extent of mines our results highlight the importance of considering different components of land use in the wildland urban interface when investigating stream chemistry and runoff generation processes in the context of future development our findings have implications for predicting future changes in stream chemistry and hydrology in

4828,understanding the hydraulic connections between overburden aquifers is key to safe coal mining however accurately identifying such connections remains challenging conventional investigation methods include geophysical investigation pumping test and hydrochemical analysis which are time consuming expensive and cannot determine continuous variations in hydraulic connection in this paper we performed time series analysis for analyzing water level time series data to identify the hydraulic connections between overburden aquifers in a coalfield the proposed method can identify such connections more clearly than hydrochemical methods it is especially useful in areas where an aquifer system is subject to strong perturbations keywords hydraulic connection correlation analysis time series analysis aquifer systems 1 introduction in coalfields multiple aquifers with different hydraulic and mechanicals properties generally overlie the coal seams qu et al 2020b disturbance by coal mining can cause new fractures to develop in different strata that can breach the hydraulic barriers between previously unconnected aquifers this may lead to water inrush and deterioration of water quality in coalfields izadi et al 2011 adhikary and guo 2014 as a coalfield s hydrogeological setting may change dynamically investigation of the hydraulic connections between overburden aquifers is challenging common methods used for investigating such hydraulic connections include hydrochemical and isotopic methods han et al 2013 murkute 2014 gomo and vermeulen 2014 qu et al 2018 geophysical methods yu et al 2007 and pumping tests theis 1935 jacob 1940 however these are time consuming expensive and do not reveal temporal variation in the hydraulic connections between overburden aquifers in hydrology time series analysis is a useful tool for investigating the signal responses of a hydrological system in time series analysis the aquifer system is treated as a black box in which input data are related to output data through statistical functions and used to understand the structure and mechanism of an aquifer system larocque et al 1998 kim et al 2000 since the 20th century time series methods have been widely used to interpret geological data such as water levels discharges and precipitation in addition they have provided valuable information on the hydrogeological behavior of geometrically complex fractured and karstic aquifers chatfield 2000 bernard and delay 2008 sahu et al 2009 zhang and lópez 2019 however time series analysis is rarely used to investigate hydraulic connections among overburden aquifers in coalfield in 2013 hydrogeological investigation was completed in the caojiatan coalfield northwestern china and no further investigations have been carried out because of their difficulty and a huge workload thus changes in hydraulic connections between overburden aquifers after mining production remain unknown accordingly it is challenging to prevent water disasters during mining when dramatic changes have occurred li et al 2018 to meet this challenge this study uses hydrochemical methods cross correlation coherence analysis and wavelet coherence analysis of water level time series data to characterize variation in the hydraulic connections between overburden aquifers in caojiatan coalfield water levels were measured hourly at six monitoring wells from 2018 to 2019 then the hydraulic connections derived from hydrochemical analysis and time series data analysis was compared a precise conceptualized flowchart with a problem statement and key component in this study is below fig 1 2 study area 2 1 overview of the coalfield covering an area of 109 28 km2 the caojiatan coalfield is located north of yulin city shaanxi province china fig 2 it has a typical semi arid continental monsoon climate the mean annual precipitation is 434 mm of which 66 falls in july august and september the caojiatan coalfield is located at the southern margin of the maowusu desert and more than 70 of it is desert the main landforms are desert bottomland and dunes hydrogeological investigation of caojiatan coalfield was completed in 2013 before construction of the coalfield s infrastructure began stoping work started at the end of 2018 and the working face currently being mined is panel 122106 which is located in the no 12 mining area in the south of the coalfield and is being mined from the northeast to southwest fig 2 a mine drainage pump house is located on the northwestern end of the main roadway which is perpendicular to panel 122106 and drainage work began in april 2019 2 2 geology and hydrogeology the study area is within the ordos basin and most of the surface is covered by a quaternary sand layer there are no large faults depressions or magmatic activity in the area wang et al 2010 from bottom to top the strata of the coalfield consists of the middle jurassic yan an group j2y the zhiluo group j2z anding group j2a neogene baode group n2b and quaternary eolian sand q4 eol fig 2 li et al 2008 yang et al 2015 the j2a and j2z strata are in conformable contact while the other strata are in unconformable contact the main mined coal seam is 2 2 coal located in stratum j2y there are five main aquifers aquitards in the coalfield j2y sandstone aquifer j2z sandstone aquifer j2a weathered bedrock aquifer n2b red clay aquitard and the q4 eol pore aquifer according to aquifer tests the specific capacity and water yield of different aquifers are shown in table 1 the main groundwater recharge source in this area is precipitation the main river in the mining area is the yeji river located to the southeast which is seasonal 3 method 3 1 data observation in this study data including groundwater level and barometric pressure were obtained from pressure transducers installed in six observation wells hereafter wells these six wells included one well located in the quaternary aquifer labeled ssg3 at a depth of 47 m two wells located in the anding group weathered bedrock aquifer labeled fhg1 and fhg3 at depths of 171 and 127 m and three wells located in the zhiluo group sandstone aquifer labeled zlg1 zlg2 and zlg3 at depths of 320 276 and 240 m fig 2 we used data loggers in the six wells to observe the dynamic variations in groundwater level solinst leveloggers solinst canada ltd fig 4 a f and solinst barologger was equipped in the zlg2 well to observe the barometric pressure fig 4g all the wells were located away from the 122106 working face so the water levels were not affected by mining wells fhg1 and fhg3 were in the j2a weathering bedrock aquifer which is the main water source differences in the short term changes in fhg1 and fhg3 are caused by pumping fhg1 is located near a factory and is affected by pumping while fhg3 is located further away and thus shows little disturbance fig 2 in this study disturbance of drainage represented the influence of mine drainage which is the daily work during coal mining to prevent from inrush water disaster by coincidence a drainage pump house is located near zlg2 and started work in april 2019 so the massive drawdown of the groundwater level was observed in zlg2 after april 2019 fig 4d however no detailed drainage data is available we deduced its potential drainage from the mining progress schedule 3 2 samples collection and analysis sixteen water samples were collected in the caojiatan coalfield in june and december 2018 including two from quaternary groundwater ssg1 ssg3 six from j2a groundwater fhg1 fhg3 six from j2z groundwater zlg1 zlg3 and two from surface water s1 s2 groundwater samples were measured at the state key laboratory of biogeology and environmental geology and the moe key laboratory of groundwater circulation and environmental evolution china university of geosciences beijing the results are shown in table 2 the ph was tested in situ using a portable multi parameter monitor manta 2 0 major ions na k ca2 mg2 f no3 so4 2 cl were measured by ion chromatography at a precision of 1 hco3 and co3 2 were measured by conventional titration with hcl the total dissolved solids tds were obtained by the formula tds ca2 mg2 na k so4 2 no3 cl f co3 2 hco3 0 5hco3 stable isotope ratios δd and δ18o were determined by a liquid water isotope analyzer lgr lwia 24d according to the vsmow standard with precisions of 0 21 and 0 04 respectively 3 3 correlation analysis in hydrology bivariate analysis can be used to characterize the transformation of two signals in terms of their correlations this includes cross correlation analysis in the time domain coherence analysis in the frequency domain wavelet coherence analysis in the frequency and time domain cross amplitude and gain function etc larocque et al 1998 yan et al 2017 in this study we used a cross correlation coherence and wavelet coherence analysis to identify the correlation between groundwater levels in different aquifers 3 3 1 cross correlation analysis cross correlation analysis is generally used to determine the relationship between an input series xt and an output series yt it gives the extent of correlation between the two series as the vary over time intervals the cross correlation function rxy k is defined as 1 r xy k c xy k σ x σ y c xy k 1 n t 1 n k x t x y t k y where k is lag time cxy k is the cross correlogram σx and σy are the standard deviations of the two time series and x and y are the means of series xt and yt respectively the cross correlation function is not symmetrical rxy k ryx k and if k 0 x replaces y in eq 1 and vice versa both rxy k 0 and rxy k 0 for k 0 would indicate an effect massei et al 2006 lee and lee 2000 in this study the groundwater levels monitored at different aquifers were used as input and output signals to conduct cross correlation analysis and identify the hydraulic connections between different aquifers 3 3 2 coherence analysis the cross spectral density function sxy f corresponds to the fourier transform of the cross correlation function the coherence function shows the relationship between the two time series in terms of frequency randolph et al 1970 zhang 2010 which indicates whether changes in the output series correspond to the same type of changes in the input series as one method of cross spectral analysis the coherence function coxy f can show the linearity of relationship which depends on the simple and cross spectral density functions sx f sy f and sxy f and is defined as 2 c o xy f s xy f s x f s y f where f is frequency cycles per day cpd the value of coxy f varies between 0 and 1 where 0 indicates two independent time series and 1 indicates two dependent series sahu 2004 3 3 3 wavelet coherence wavelet coherence wtc is a powerful tool for analyzing nonstationary signals yan et al 2017 a time series can be converted into a time frequency space based on wtc and to attempt to identify the correlation between different signals the wtc is defined as follow zhang et al 2019 3 r 2 x y s s 1 w x y 2 s s 1 w x s s 1 w y where x and y are the terms of the two time series w is the cross wavelet transform s is the wavelet scale and s is a smoothing operator the range of the wtc is between 0 and 1 4 results 4 1 hydrochemical analysis 4 1 1 water type a piper trigram can vividly describe the relative concentrations of major ions in different water samples similarities and differences between hydrochemical types can be determined by the distribution of the positions of the water samples in the trigram subrahmanyam and yadaiah 2001 as shown in fig 5 samples of surface water and q4 eol groundwater fall within the left side of the diamond area and exhibit higher concentrations of ca2 na mg2 and hco3 with the hydrochemical types being dominated by ca mg hco3 and na mg hco3 by contrast samples of deep groundwater j2a and j2z show main ion characteristics of higher concentrations of na hco3 and cl with the hydrochemical types dominated by na hco3 and na cl hco3 meanwhile there is a clear sequence from surface water over q4 eol groundwater to the j2a and j2z groundwater especially in the cations ternary diagram the dominant cations of j2a and j2z groundwater is similar but different from those of surface water and q4 eol groundwater 4 1 2 stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes the composition of stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes is affected by meteorological processes the values and distribution characteristics of δd and δ18o provide a basis for the investigation of groundwater recharge sources yeh et al 2011 and hydraulic connection horst et al 2007 craig 1961 was the first to find a linear relationship between δd and δ18o in global rainfall namely the craig equation δd 8δ18o 10 which is called the global meteoric water line gmwl the study area is part of the yushen coalfield and it is thus reasonable to use the line as the lmwl of the study area thus we chose the local meteoric precipitation line in yulin area as the reference line where δd 7 33δ18o 2 14 wang et al 2010 as fig 6 shows the δ18o and δd values of j2a groundwater are closed to that of j2z groundwater but different from surface water and q4 eol groundwater which is consistent to the regularity of water types above in addition the δ18o and δd values in surface water and q4 eol groundwater are more positive than those of j2a and j2z groundwater all the water samples in the study area were located near the lmwl with no obvious deviation with only the surface water samples deviating slightly to the upper right and showing obvious evaporation 4 2 correlation analysis in correlation analysis water level time series from different aquifers were treated as the system s input and output signals that should contain the information needed to characterize the hydraulic connections between the aquifers of the underground mine complex zhang 2010 the relationship between water level time series data are of great interest because groundwater level data is readily measured and their correlations are the most relevant variable in determining hydraulic connection firstly a cross correlation analysis was performed with groundwater level data from june 2018 to june 2019 from the j2a weathered bedrock aquifer wells fhg1 and fhg3 and those in the q4 eol aquifer well ssg3 and j2z sandstone aquifer wells zlg1 zlg3 as the input and output signals the water levels monitored in this period were stable without large variation during this period the cross correlation function corresponding to a lag time of 0 day between the water level data from the q4 eol aquifer and j2a weathered bedrock aquifer was 0 5 fig 7 a indicating a moderate correlation by contrast the cross correlation function corresponding lag time of 0 day between the water levels in aquifers j2a and j2z was 0 9 with a positive rxy k fig 7b c indicating strong correlation meanwhile it is obvious that the cross correlation between fhg1 and fhg3 is similar to that between j2a and j2z groundwater indicating that the cross correlation between j2a and j2z water levels is similar to those of water levels within the same aquifers according to the pumping test results fig 14 we found that the hydraulic conductivities of wells drilled in the same aquifers were similar while there were obvious differences between wells drilled in different aquifers in addition the water levels in aquifer j2a wells fhg1 and fhg3 were similar but different to those in aquifer j2z fig 4 thus the hydraulic conductivity and water levels in wells drilled in the same aquifer were similar but different to those of wells in other aquifers indicating that the heterogeneity within an aquifer is less than that between two adjacent aquifers in addition to cross correlation analysis coherence analysis and wavelet coherence analysis can also show the linear relationship between input and output signals angelini 1997 ghanbari and bravo 2011 zhang et al 2019 in order to identify the multiple components induced the fluctuations of water level the spectral analyses of ssg3 fhg1 and zlg1 were involved in frequency band of 0 3 cpd it is helpful to identify the wanted components induced fluctuation of water level in different aquifers as shown in fig 8 a no obvious amplitude was observed in entire frequency bands indicating that the water level in ssg3 is difficult to respond to multiple components by contrast the obvious amplitudes were observed in multiple frequency bands in fhg1 and zlg1 fig 8b c indicating that the water level in fhg1 and zlg1 both show response to precipitation earth tides and barometric pressure qu et al 2020a and then coherence and wavelet coherence analyses were used to investigate the correlations between different aquifers as fig 9 a shows the coherence function shows good coherence 0 82 coxy f 0 69 at a 95 confidence level between the input signal fhg1 and output signal zlg1 at low frequencies 0 01 0 05 cpd in addition the coherence observed at higher frequencies especially at 0 93 cpd 1 cpd 1 93 cpd and 2 cpd is higher than that at low frequencies by contrast the coherence function shows poor coherence coxy f 0 5 at a 95 confidence level between the input signal fhg1 and output signal ssg3 at multiple frequencies fig 9b in addition the water levels in fhg1 and zlg1 are highly coherent at a 95 confidence level with coherence coefficients 0 9 within the period band of 0 5 1 days throughout the entire dataset fig 10 it is inferred that the water level data for aquifers j2a and j2z have good coherence at multiple frequencies over the whole study period which is consistent with the results of the cross correlation and coherence analyses 5 discussion 5 1 hydrochemical characteristics as fig 5 shows the hydrochemical types of different water samples show zoning characteristics among them the hydrochemical types of surface water are similar to those of q4 eol groundwater with j2a groundwater being similar to j2z groundwater it is inferred that a hydraulic connection may exist between j2a groundwater and j2z groundwater in addition according to the hydrogen and oxygen isotopes the surface water samples plot further to the right of the lmwl which indicates more intense evaporation according to the hydrogeological conditions surface water is located on the surface and is susceptible to evaporation because of its shallow water level depth by contrast the samples of j2a and j2z groundwater plot closer to the lmwl which indicates that the main recharge source is precipitation with weak evaporation in addition the hydrogen and oxygen isotope concentrations in j2a and j2z groundwater were relatively low indicating that the groundwater recharge might occur in a cold period in consideration of its depleted δd δ18o values qu et al 2018 according to the relative positions of the sampling points fig 6 the different aquifers show obvious differences in hydrogen and oxygen isotope characteristics but the j2a and j2z groundwater sampling points show a distribution of similar δd δ18o values indicating they have the same recharge source and have a hydraulic connection in order to draw an inference regarding the respective temperatures of groundwater recharge we estimated the temperature t of recharge eqs 4 thomas and theresa 2013 li et al 2013 as 4 δ 18 o 0 7 t 13 6 the results are shown in table 3 we found that the recharge temperature of j2a groundwater were both closed to those of j2z groundwater but different to those of surface water and q4 eol groundwater indicating that the recharge source of j2a groundwater is close to j2z groundwater thus j2a and j2z groundwater may have a hydraulic connection which is consistent with the results above according to the results of hydrochemical analysis the possible hydraulic connection between the j2a and j2z aquifers can be explained by the hydrogeological conditions in the study area according to the geological strata profiles of the wells fig 3 j2a aquifer is adjacent to j2z aquifer with conformable contact however j2a aquifer is separated from q4 eol aquifer by an n2b red clay aquitard so their hydraulic connection is weak although the strong permeability of q4 eol aquifer is beneficial to the downward leakage of groundwater this process is blocked by the n2b red clay aquitard in contrast the groundwater in the underlying j2a aquifer can enter j2z aquifer after precipitation recharge via a hydraulic connection 5 2 correlation analysis according to the long term observations groundwater levels fig 4 except for well zlg2 the groundwater levels in other wells remained relatively stable without obvious change the q4 eol groundwater level ssg3 showed slight fluctuation which may be caused by seasonal precipitation fig 4g the dynamics of the j2a groundwater level wells fhg1 and fhg3 are characterized by slow declines and slight rises which may be caused by lateral runoff recharge meanwhile the groundwater level of j2z aquifer wells zlg1 and zlg3 shows consistent dynamics consistent with those of j2a aquifer as for well zlg2 the groundwater level dynamics were consistent with those of other j2z wells before april 2019 then the groundwater level dropped sharply due to drainage disturbance afterward therefore correlation analyses before and after drainage disturbance is necessary to investigate the influence of drainage on hydraulic connection 5 2 1 hydraulic connection under natural condition in cross correlation analysis different cross correlation functions rxy k were associated with different lag times k to show the responses between the input and output signals the lag time with the highest cross correlation function is called the delay the time lag between time 0 and the time of the maximum cross correlation function which determines how fast the system propagates to the output point zhang 2010 as fig 7 shows the cross correlation function of groundwater levels in aquifers j2a and j2z shows that the delay is very short ranging from 1 5 days fig 7c d as indicated by the cross correlation function reaching a maximum 0 9 at a lag of 1 5 days which indicates that the input signal j2a groundwater level is transferred rapidly through the system into the output signal j2z groundwater level there are two possible reasons for this phenomenon 1 aquifer j2a is adjacent to aquifer j2z and their continuous stratigraphic deposition would facilitate a hydraulic connection 2 according to the results of pumping tests in the study area the hydraulic conductivity and specific capacity of different aquifers were obtained as fig 14 shows the hydraulic conductivity and specific capacity of aquifer j2a ranged from 0 32 to 0 53 m d and 0 03 0 07 l s m moderate permeability indicating that the system may be dominated by permeable features i e primary and tectonic fractures sahu et al 2009 groundwater flow predominantly occurs through fractures resulting in a higher potential groundwater flow in aquifer j2a thus j2a groundwater can readily enter j2z groundwater creating a hydraulic connection in contrast the cross correlation function between the groundwater levels of j2a and q4 eol indicates that the delay is around 50 days fig 7a as indicated by the maximum correlation of around 0 7 occurring with a lag of 50 days which indicates that the output signal q4 eol groundwater level responds to the input signal j2a groundwater level after about two months the delay between the j2a and q4 eol groundwater levels was approximately 50 times longer than that between the j2a and j2z groundwater levels the possible reason is the blockage caused by the n2b red clay aquitard between aquifers j2a and q4 eol according to li et al 2011 in northern shaanxi province the hydraulic conductivity of n2b red clay aquitard ranges from 0 00326 to 0 00705 m d indicating poor permeability in this scenario the velocity of groundwater flow in the n2b red clay aquitard would be much slower than that in j2a aquifer thus it is difficult to make a hydraulic connection between aquifers j2a and q4 eol in order to quantify the fluxes of groundwater flow between different aquifers the vertical fluxes per area q were calculated domenico and schwartz 1998 5 q a k h 1 h 2 l a 1 m 2 where q is the vertical fluxes per area between two aquifers a is the area of cross section k is the hydraulic conductivity between two aquifers k is the hydraulic conductivity of the n2b aquitard between aquifers q4 eol and j2a and the hydraulic conductivity of j2a aquifer between j2z and j2a aquifer because j2a and j2z aquifers are in conformable contact h1 h2 is the difference in water level between two aquifers l is the thickness between two aquifers the thickness of n2b aquitard between q4 eol and j2a and the thickness of j2a aquifer between j2z and j2a aquifer as shown in table 4 the q value between aquifers j2z and j2a was obviously larger than that between aquifers q4 eol and j2a indicating a bad hydraulic connection between q4 eol and j2a aquifer and good hydraulic connection between aquifers j2z and j2a in order to verify the correlation between the j2a and j2z groundwater levels the coherence analysis and wavelet coherence analysis were conducted as fig 9a shows the q4 eol and j2a groundwater levels had poor coherence at multiple frequencies especially the tidal band at 1 93 cpd m2 tide the amplitude of m2 represents aquifer confinement aquifer q4 eol is unconfined so the poor confinement of q4 eol may lead to decoupling from aquifer j2a consequently the changes in groundwater level in q4 eol will be unlikely to be transmitted by pressure in contrast good coherence between the groundwater levels in wells fhg1 and zlg1 at low frequencies was found fig 9b in hydrology low frequencies are generally affected by long term factors such as precipitation herman et al 2009 so it is inferred that the j2a and j2z aquifer groundwater levels show similar response to precipitation in addition the coherence observed at 0 9 1 cpd and 1 9 2 cpd is higher than that at lower frequencies according to the general characteristics of spectrum analysis 0 9 1 cpd and 1 9 2 cpd correspond to the main frequencies of the earth tide and barometric pressure response k1 1 002 cpd o1 0 93 cpd m2 1 93 cpd s2 2 cpd xue et al 2016 fig 8 the high coherence at these frequencies indicates that the j2a and j2z groundwater level both are likely to be associated with the earth tide and barometric pressure since the coherence function indicates whether the changes in the output series correspond to the same type of changes in the input signal zhang 2010 in fig 10 the water levels in wells fhg1 and zlg1 are highly coherent at a 95 confidence level the coherence coefficients are 0 9 within the band between 0 5 and 1 days corresponding to the main periods of the earth tide and barometric pressure responses k1 0 997 days o1 1 076 days m2 0 518 days s2 0 5 days the arrows are mainly pointing right in the wavelet coherence analysis indicating a good positive correlation and short lag time between the water levels in wells fhg1 and zlg1 zhang et al 2019 the study wells fhg1 and zlg1 were nearly 100 m apart both the coherence and wavelet coherence analysis results show that there is high coherence in the frequency bands of 0 9 1 cpd and 1 9 2 cpd which are dominated by the tidal and barometric pressure effects indicating confinement of the aquifer thus the possibility of natural leakage is low furthermore a good correlation between fhg1 and zlg3 7 km apart was found and natural leakage between them is negligible in this case the correlation between fhg1 and zlg1 is similar to that of fhg1 and zlg3 indicating that the influence of natural leakage is negligible although the high coherence between the groundwater levels in aquifers j2a and j2z with barometric pressure and tide indeed indicate aquifer confinement it is not due to a good hydraulic connection between the aquifers according to previous studies in a perfectly confined aquifer groundwater flow only occurs within the aquifer and there is no vertical leakage due to the pore elastic deformation caused by barometric pressure and tidal strain thus no hydraulic connection could be found hsieh et al 1987 wang et al 2018 for a purely unconfined aquifer only vertical hydraulic diffusion occurs due to pore elastic deformation roeloffs 1996 however most natural aquifers are neither perfectly confined at the tidal and barometric pressure frequency nor purely unconfined but are somewhere in between wang et al 2018 thus vertical leakage also exists in these aquifers even when they show a barometric pressure or tidal response which means that a hydraulic connection exists in these aquifers the calculations of the vertical fluxes between different aquifers also show that the vertical fluxes between aquifers j2a and j2z are significantly larger than those of aquifers q4 eol and j2a table 4 indicating that there is a hydraulic connection between aquifers j2a and j2z in conclusion the correlation analysis shows that there is a strong correlation between j2a and j2z groundwater in both the time and frequency domain indicating the presence of hydraulic connection in order to verify the reasonability of correlation analysis on identifying hydraulic connection the traditional method pumping tests were carried out in the study area peng et al 2019 two sets of pumping tests were performed to detect the hydraulic connection between q4 eol and j2a aquifers and j2a and j2z aquifers as shown in fig 15a the static observation depth of groundwater level in q4 eol aquifer is 13 1 m but without decline after the pumping maximum pumping depth reached 74 m in j2a aquifer indicating the poor hydraulic connection between q4 eol and j2a aquifers by contrast the static observation depth of groundwater level in j2a aquifer is 5 2 m but show obvious variation approximate 1 01 m after the pumping maximum pumping depth reached 56 m in j2z aquifer fig 15b it indicated good hydraulic connection with a small delay 1 day between j2a and j2z groundwater level which is consistent with correlation analysis above 5 2 2 hydraulic connection under drainage disturbance as discussed above the purpose of this study was to investigate the hydraulic connection among different overburden aquifers in caojiatan coalfield during the study period the groundwater levels in wells ssg3 fhg1 fhg3 zlg1 and zlg3 were stable without any large changes however the groundwater level in well zlg2 showed abnormal changes after april 2019 well zlg2 is located approximately 50 m from a drainage pumping room fig 2 and is far away from the other wells 2km thus drainage disturbance only had a large impact on the groundwater level in zlg2 since there were no other wells within 2 km of the pumping room we cannot determine the range of disturbance distances exactly in order to investigate whether correlation analysis can provide useful information about the changes of hydraulic connection affected by drainage disturbance we analyzed water level data collected before and after drainage to quantify the impacts of human activity on the hydraulic connection between different aquifers the changes in hydrogeological properties and hydrological responses to external loading e g precipitation earth tides or barometric pressure before and after drainage were characterized and compared to provide a better understanding of the hydraulic connections and how they are affected by drainage cross correlation analysis was performed on time series of groundwater levels in wells fhg1 and zlg2 for selected periods of time where continuous water level data were available as fig 11 a shows the cross correlation function between fhg1 and zlg2 was positive prior to drainage with a maximum of 0 9 meanwhile the delay is closed to zero indicating a good hydraulic response between j2a and j2z groundwater however the graph fig 11b shows different behavior with respect to the post disturbance condition the maximum cross correlation function was reduced to 0 48 which is 47 lower than that pre disturbance this sharp drop in the correlation in the time domain can be interpreted in terms of variation in groundwater level groundwater levels in wells fhg1 and zlg2 were stable under natural conditions with only low fluctuation due to water exchange between aquifers or the micro dynamics caused by earth tides or barometric pressure however the groundwater level in well zlg2 showed a significant decline from 1190 m to 1160 m after mine drainage disturbance as an independent signal the strong disturbance of mine drainage can break the correlation between the input and output signals in this system although the fhg1 groundwater level remained stable over the entire study period the drainage disturbance induced a significant change in the zlg2 groundwater level which would weaken the cross correlation between the two in addition to cross correlation analysis coherence analysis and wavelet coherence analysis were used to further explain the results of the cross correlation analysis fig 12 shows variations in the coherence function for pre and post disturbance drainage conditions in fig 12a at a 95 confidence level high coherence was observed between the input fhg1 groundwater level and output zlg2 groundwater level signals at multiple frequencies before drainage disturbance in contrast the coherence function at a 95 confidence level decreased after drainage fig 12b with the ranges of 0 58 0 7 and 0 74 0 88 at frequencies 0 9 1 cpd and 1 9 2 cpd respectively decreasing to 0 06 0 08 and 0 07 0 1 fig 12 indicating less coherence between the input and output signals in addition it can be seen that the water levels in wells fhg1 and zlg2 were highly coherent at a 95 confidence level with coherence coefficients 0 9 within the band between 0 5 and 1 days around the semidiurnal and diurnal components before april 2019 fig 13 in the wavelet coherence analysis the arrows are mainly pointing right indicating a good positive correlation and short lag time between the water levels in wells fhg1 and zlg2 before april 2019 however after the drainage disturbance april 2019 the coherence coefficients decreased from 0 9 to 0 4 within the 0 5 1 day period previous studies have concluded that a sharp drop in groundwater level caused by external disturbance has a great impact on the tidal and barometric pressure responses of a well s water level zhang et al 2019 the possible reason is that human activities have caused atmospheric pressure to enter the aquifer through extraction tunnels or other passages which counteracts the effect of atmospheric pressure on the aquifer so the barometric effect disappears and the confinement of the aquifer gets worse in addition drainage that induces a large decline in water level may affect the pore pressure david et al 2017 so the tidal inducement of the transmission of strain may be disturbed consequently the tidal response of water level may disappear after drainage disturbance 6 conclusions based on hydrochemical methods and correlation analysis this study investigated the hydraulic connections between overburden aquifers in caojiatan coalfield the results show that the hydrochemical type and hydrogen and oxygen isotope characteristics in the j2a weathered bedrock aquifer are close to those of the j2z sandstone aquifer indicative of a hydraulic connection between them the results of cross correlation and coherence analysis show that the groundwater levels in aquifers j2a and j2z are highly cross correlated with a rapid response speed and long response time meanwhile the groundwater levels in j2a and j2z show good coherence at multiple frequencies in conclusion it can be inferred that continuous long term monitoring of groundwater levels and hydrochemical data is required to investigate the hydraulic connections between overburden aquifers hydrochemical methods and correlation analysis can identify such connections in addition correlation analysis can also investigate changes in hydraulic connections caused by mine drainage or other disturbances thereby providing a reference for mining safety of course it is necessary to fully understand the hydrogeological conditions of the study area beforehand this study will be a useful reference for the regular

4828,understanding the hydraulic connections between overburden aquifers is key to safe coal mining however accurately identifying such connections remains challenging conventional investigation methods include geophysical investigation pumping test and hydrochemical analysis which are time consuming expensive and cannot determine continuous variations in hydraulic connection in this paper we performed time series analysis for analyzing water level time series data to identify the hydraulic connections between overburden aquifers in a coalfield the proposed method can identify such connections more clearly than hydrochemical methods it is especially useful in areas where an aquifer system is subject to strong perturbations keywords hydraulic connection correlation analysis time series analysis aquifer systems 1 introduction in coalfields multiple aquifers with different hydraulic and mechanicals properties generally overlie the coal seams qu et al 2020b disturbance by coal mining can cause new fractures to develop in different strata that can breach the hydraulic barriers between previously unconnected aquifers this may lead to water inrush and deterioration of water quality in coalfields izadi et al 2011 adhikary and guo 2014 as a coalfield s hydrogeological setting may change dynamically investigation of the hydraulic connections between overburden aquifers is challenging common methods used for investigating such hydraulic connections include hydrochemical and isotopic methods han et al 2013 murkute 2014 gomo and vermeulen 2014 qu et al 2018 geophysical methods yu et al 2007 and pumping tests theis 1935 jacob 1940 however these are time consuming expensive and do not reveal temporal variation in the hydraulic connections between overburden aquifers in hydrology time series analysis is a useful tool for investigating the signal responses of a hydrological system in time series analysis the aquifer system is treated as a black box in which input data are related to output data through statistical functions and used to understand the structure and mechanism of an aquifer system larocque et al 1998 kim et al 2000 since the 20th century time series methods have been widely used to interpret geological data such as water levels discharges and precipitation in addition they have provided valuable information on the hydrogeological behavior of geometrically complex fractured and karstic aquifers chatfield 2000 bernard and delay 2008 sahu et al 2009 zhang and lópez 2019 however time series analysis is rarely used to investigate hydraulic connections among overburden aquifers in coalfield in 2013 hydrogeological investigation was completed in the caojiatan coalfield northwestern china and no further investigations have been carried out because of their difficulty and a huge workload thus changes in hydraulic connections between overburden aquifers after mining production remain unknown accordingly it is challenging to prevent water disasters during mining when dramatic changes have occurred li et al 2018 to meet this challenge this study uses hydrochemical methods cross correlation coherence analysis and wavelet coherence analysis of water level time series data to characterize variation in the hydraulic connections between overburden aquifers in caojiatan coalfield water levels were measured hourly at six monitoring wells from 2018 to 2019 then the hydraulic connections derived from hydrochemical analysis and time series data analysis was compared a precise conceptualized flowchart with a problem statement and key component in this study is below fig 1 2 study area 2 1 overview of the coalfield covering an area of 109 28 km2 the caojiatan coalfield is located north of yulin city shaanxi province china fig 2 it has a typical semi arid continental monsoon climate the mean annual precipitation is 434 mm of which 66 falls in july august and september the caojiatan coalfield is located at the southern margin of the maowusu desert and more than 70 of it is desert the main landforms are desert bottomland and dunes hydrogeological investigation of caojiatan coalfield was completed in 2013 before construction of the coalfield s infrastructure began stoping work started at the end of 2018 and the working face currently being mined is panel 122106 which is located in the no 12 mining area in the south of the coalfield and is being mined from the northeast to southwest fig 2 a mine drainage pump house is located on the northwestern end of the main roadway which is perpendicular to panel 122106 and drainage work began in april 2019 2 2 geology and hydrogeology the study area is within the ordos basin and most of the surface is covered by a quaternary sand layer there are no large faults depressions or magmatic activity in the area wang et al 2010 from bottom to top the strata of the coalfield consists of the middle jurassic yan an group j2y the zhiluo group j2z anding group j2a neogene baode group n2b and quaternary eolian sand q4 eol fig 2 li et al 2008 yang et al 2015 the j2a and j2z strata are in conformable contact while the other strata are in unconformable contact the main mined coal seam is 2 2 coal located in stratum j2y there are five main aquifers aquitards in the coalfield j2y sandstone aquifer j2z sandstone aquifer j2a weathered bedrock aquifer n2b red clay aquitard and the q4 eol pore aquifer according to aquifer tests the specific capacity and water yield of different aquifers are shown in table 1 the main groundwater recharge source in this area is precipitation the main river in the mining area is the yeji river located to the southeast which is seasonal 3 method 3 1 data observation in this study data including groundwater level and barometric pressure were obtained from pressure transducers installed in six observation wells hereafter wells these six wells included one well located in the quaternary aquifer labeled ssg3 at a depth of 47 m two wells located in the anding group weathered bedrock aquifer labeled fhg1 and fhg3 at depths of 171 and 127 m and three wells located in the zhiluo group sandstone aquifer labeled zlg1 zlg2 and zlg3 at depths of 320 276 and 240 m fig 2 we used data loggers in the six wells to observe the dynamic variations in groundwater level solinst leveloggers solinst canada ltd fig 4 a f and solinst barologger was equipped in the zlg2 well to observe the barometric pressure fig 4g all the wells were located away from the 122106 working face so the water levels were not affected by mining wells fhg1 and fhg3 were in the j2a weathering bedrock aquifer which is the main water source differences in the short term changes in fhg1 and fhg3 are caused by pumping fhg1 is located near a factory and is affected by pumping while fhg3 is located further away and thus shows little disturbance fig 2 in this study disturbance of drainage represented the influence of mine drainage which is the daily work during coal mining to prevent from inrush water disaster by coincidence a drainage pump house is located near zlg2 and started work in april 2019 so the massive drawdown of the groundwater level was observed in zlg2 after april 2019 fig 4d however no detailed drainage data is available we deduced its potential drainage from the mining progress schedule 3 2 samples collection and analysis sixteen water samples were collected in the caojiatan coalfield in june and december 2018 including two from quaternary groundwater ssg1 ssg3 six from j2a groundwater fhg1 fhg3 six from j2z groundwater zlg1 zlg3 and two from surface water s1 s2 groundwater samples were measured at the state key laboratory of biogeology and environmental geology and the moe key laboratory of groundwater circulation and environmental evolution china university of geosciences beijing the results are shown in table 2 the ph was tested in situ using a portable multi parameter monitor manta 2 0 major ions na k ca2 mg2 f no3 so4 2 cl were measured by ion chromatography at a precision of 1 hco3 and co3 2 were measured by conventional titration with hcl the total dissolved solids tds were obtained by the formula tds ca2 mg2 na k so4 2 no3 cl f co3 2 hco3 0 5hco3 stable isotope ratios δd and δ18o were determined by a liquid water isotope analyzer lgr lwia 24d according to the vsmow standard with precisions of 0 21 and 0 04 respectively 3 3 correlation analysis in hydrology bivariate analysis can be used to characterize the transformation of two signals in terms of their correlations this includes cross correlation analysis in the time domain coherence analysis in the frequency domain wavelet coherence analysis in the frequency and time domain cross amplitude and gain function etc larocque et al 1998 yan et al 2017 in this study we used a cross correlation coherence and wavelet coherence analysis to identify the correlation between groundwater levels in different aquifers 3 3 1 cross correlation analysis cross correlation analysis is generally used to determine the relationship between an input series xt and an output series yt it gives the extent of correlation between the two series as the vary over time intervals the cross correlation function rxy k is defined as 1 r xy k c xy k σ x σ y c xy k 1 n t 1 n k x t x y t k y where k is lag time cxy k is the cross correlogram σx and σy are the standard deviations of the two time series and x and y are the means of series xt and yt respectively the cross correlation function is not symmetrical rxy k ryx k and if k 0 x replaces y in eq 1 and vice versa both rxy k 0 and rxy k 0 for k 0 would indicate an effect massei et al 2006 lee and lee 2000 in this study the groundwater levels monitored at different aquifers were used as input and output signals to conduct cross correlation analysis and identify the hydraulic connections between different aquifers 3 3 2 coherence analysis the cross spectral density function sxy f corresponds to the fourier transform of the cross correlation function the coherence function shows the relationship between the two time series in terms of frequency randolph et al 1970 zhang 2010 which indicates whether changes in the output series correspond to the same type of changes in the input series as one method of cross spectral analysis the coherence function coxy f can show the linearity of relationship which depends on the simple and cross spectral density functions sx f sy f and sxy f and is defined as 2 c o xy f s xy f s x f s y f where f is frequency cycles per day cpd the value of coxy f varies between 0 and 1 where 0 indicates two independent time series and 1 indicates two dependent series sahu 2004 3 3 3 wavelet coherence wavelet coherence wtc is a powerful tool for analyzing nonstationary signals yan et al 2017 a time series can be converted into a time frequency space based on wtc and to attempt to identify the correlation between different signals the wtc is defined as follow zhang et al 2019 3 r 2 x y s s 1 w x y 2 s s 1 w x s s 1 w y where x and y are the terms of the two time series w is the cross wavelet transform s is the wavelet scale and s is a smoothing operator the range of the wtc is between 0 and 1 4 results 4 1 hydrochemical analysis 4 1 1 water type a piper trigram can vividly describe the relative concentrations of major ions in different water samples similarities and differences between hydrochemical types can be determined by the distribution of the positions of the water samples in the trigram subrahmanyam and yadaiah 2001 as shown in fig 5 samples of surface water and q4 eol groundwater fall within the left side of the diamond area and exhibit higher concentrations of ca2 na mg2 and hco3 with the hydrochemical types being dominated by ca mg hco3 and na mg hco3 by contrast samples of deep groundwater j2a and j2z show main ion characteristics of higher concentrations of na hco3 and cl with the hydrochemical types dominated by na hco3 and na cl hco3 meanwhile there is a clear sequence from surface water over q4 eol groundwater to the j2a and j2z groundwater especially in the cations ternary diagram the dominant cations of j2a and j2z groundwater is similar but different from those of surface water and q4 eol groundwater 4 1 2 stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes the composition of stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes is affected by meteorological processes the values and distribution characteristics of δd and δ18o provide a basis for the investigation of groundwater recharge sources yeh et al 2011 and hydraulic connection horst et al 2007 craig 1961 was the first to find a linear relationship between δd and δ18o in global rainfall namely the craig equation δd 8δ18o 10 which is called the global meteoric water line gmwl the study area is part of the yushen coalfield and it is thus reasonable to use the line as the lmwl of the study area thus we chose the local meteoric precipitation line in yulin area as the reference line where δd 7 33δ18o 2 14 wang et al 2010 as fig 6 shows the δ18o and δd values of j2a groundwater are closed to that of j2z groundwater but different from surface water and q4 eol groundwater which is consistent to the regularity of water types above in addition the δ18o and δd values in surface water and q4 eol groundwater are more positive than those of j2a and j2z groundwater all the water samples in the study area were located near the lmwl with no obvious deviation with only the surface water samples deviating slightly to the upper right and showing obvious evaporation 4 2 correlation analysis in correlation analysis water level time series from different aquifers were treated as the system s input and output signals that should contain the information needed to characterize the hydraulic connections between the aquifers of the underground mine complex zhang 2010 the relationship between water level time series data are of great interest because groundwater level data is readily measured and their correlations are the most relevant variable in determining hydraulic connection firstly a cross correlation analysis was performed with groundwater level data from june 2018 to june 2019 from the j2a weathered bedrock aquifer wells fhg1 and fhg3 and those in the q4 eol aquifer well ssg3 and j2z sandstone aquifer wells zlg1 zlg3 as the input and output signals the water levels monitored in this period were stable without large variation during this period the cross correlation function corresponding to a lag time of 0 day between the water level data from the q4 eol aquifer and j2a weathered bedrock aquifer was 0 5 fig 7 a indicating a moderate correlation by contrast the cross correlation function corresponding lag time of 0 day between the water levels in aquifers j2a and j2z was 0 9 with a positive rxy k fig 7b c indicating strong correlation meanwhile it is obvious that the cross correlation between fhg1 and fhg3 is similar to that between j2a and j2z groundwater indicating that the cross correlation between j2a and j2z water levels is similar to those of water levels within the same aquifers according to the pumping test results fig 14 we found that the hydraulic conductivities of wells drilled in the same aquifers were similar while there were obvious differences between wells drilled in different aquifers in addition the water levels in aquifer j2a wells fhg1 and fhg3 were similar but different to those in aquifer j2z fig 4 thus the hydraulic conductivity and water levels in wells drilled in the same aquifer were similar but different to those of wells in other aquifers indicating that the heterogeneity within an aquifer is less than that between two adjacent aquifers in addition to cross correlation analysis coherence analysis and wavelet coherence analysis can also show the linear relationship between input and output signals angelini 1997 ghanbari and bravo 2011 zhang et al 2019 in order to identify the multiple components induced the fluctuations of water level the spectral analyses of ssg3 fhg1 and zlg1 were involved in frequency band of 0 3 cpd it is helpful to identify the wanted components induced fluctuation of water level in different aquifers as shown in fig 8 a no obvious amplitude was observed in entire frequency bands indicating that the water level in ssg3 is difficult to respond to multiple components by contrast the obvious amplitudes were observed in multiple frequency bands in fhg1 and zlg1 fig 8b c indicating that the water level in fhg1 and zlg1 both show response to precipitation earth tides and barometric pressure qu et al 2020a and then coherence and wavelet coherence analyses were used to investigate the correlations between different aquifers as fig 9 a shows the coherence function shows good coherence 0 82 coxy f 0 69 at a 95 confidence level between the input signal fhg1 and output signal zlg1 at low frequencies 0 01 0 05 cpd in addition the coherence observed at higher frequencies especially at 0 93 cpd 1 cpd 1 93 cpd and 2 cpd is higher than that at low frequencies by contrast the coherence function shows poor coherence coxy f 0 5 at a 95 confidence level between the input signal fhg1 and output signal ssg3 at multiple frequencies fig 9b in addition the water levels in fhg1 and zlg1 are highly coherent at a 95 confidence level with coherence coefficients 0 9 within the period band of 0 5 1 days throughout the entire dataset fig 10 it is inferred that the water level data for aquifers j2a and j2z have good coherence at multiple frequencies over the whole study period which is consistent with the results of the cross correlation and coherence analyses 5 discussion 5 1 hydrochemical characteristics as fig 5 shows the hydrochemical types of different water samples show zoning characteristics among them the hydrochemical types of surface water are similar to those of q4 eol groundwater with j2a groundwater being similar to j2z groundwater it is inferred that a hydraulic connection may exist between j2a groundwater and j2z groundwater in addition according to the hydrogen and oxygen isotopes the surface water samples plot further to the right of the lmwl which indicates more intense evaporation according to the hydrogeological conditions surface water is located on the surface and is susceptible to evaporation because of its shallow water level depth by contrast the samples of j2a and j2z groundwater plot closer to the lmwl which indicates that the main recharge source is precipitation with weak evaporation in addition the hydrogen and oxygen isotope concentrations in j2a and j2z groundwater were relatively low indicating that the groundwater recharge might occur in a cold period in consideration of its depleted δd δ18o values qu et al 2018 according to the relative positions of the sampling points fig 6 the different aquifers show obvious differences in hydrogen and oxygen isotope characteristics but the j2a and j2z groundwater sampling points show a distribution of similar δd δ18o values indicating they have the same recharge source and have a hydraulic connection in order to draw an inference regarding the respective temperatures of groundwater recharge we estimated the temperature t of recharge eqs 4 thomas and theresa 2013 li et al 2013 as 4 δ 18 o 0 7 t 13 6 the results are shown in table 3 we found that the recharge temperature of j2a groundwater were both closed to those of j2z groundwater but different to those of surface water and q4 eol groundwater indicating that the recharge source of j2a groundwater is close to j2z groundwater thus j2a and j2z groundwater may have a hydraulic connection which is consistent with the results above according to the results of hydrochemical analysis the possible hydraulic connection between the j2a and j2z aquifers can be explained by the hydrogeological conditions in the study area according to the geological strata profiles of the wells fig 3 j2a aquifer is adjacent to j2z aquifer with conformable contact however j2a aquifer is separated from q4 eol aquifer by an n2b red clay aquitard so their hydraulic connection is weak although the strong permeability of q4 eol aquifer is beneficial to the downward leakage of groundwater this process is blocked by the n2b red clay aquitard in contrast the groundwater in the underlying j2a aquifer can enter j2z aquifer after precipitation recharge via a hydraulic connection 5 2 correlation analysis according to the long term observations groundwater levels fig 4 except for well zlg2 the groundwater levels in other wells remained relatively stable without obvious change the q4 eol groundwater level ssg3 showed slight fluctuation which may be caused by seasonal precipitation fig 4g the dynamics of the j2a groundwater level wells fhg1 and fhg3 are characterized by slow declines and slight rises which may be caused by lateral runoff recharge meanwhile the groundwater level of j2z aquifer wells zlg1 and zlg3 shows consistent dynamics consistent with those of j2a aquifer as for well zlg2 the groundwater level dynamics were consistent with those of other j2z wells before april 2019 then the groundwater level dropped sharply due to drainage disturbance afterward therefore correlation analyses before and after drainage disturbance is necessary to investigate the influence of drainage on hydraulic connection 5 2 1 hydraulic connection under natural condition in cross correlation analysis different cross correlation functions rxy k were associated with different lag times k to show the responses between the input and output signals the lag time with the highest cross correlation function is called the delay the time lag between time 0 and the time of the maximum cross correlation function which determines how fast the system propagates to the output point zhang 2010 as fig 7 shows the cross correlation function of groundwater levels in aquifers j2a and j2z shows that the delay is very short ranging from 1 5 days fig 7c d as indicated by the cross correlation function reaching a maximum 0 9 at a lag of 1 5 days which indicates that the input signal j2a groundwater level is transferred rapidly through the system into the output signal j2z groundwater level there are two possible reasons for this phenomenon 1 aquifer j2a is adjacent to aquifer j2z and their continuous stratigraphic deposition would facilitate a hydraulic connection 2 according to the results of pumping tests in the study area the hydraulic conductivity and specific capacity of different aquifers were obtained as fig 14 shows the hydraulic conductivity and specific capacity of aquifer j2a ranged from 0 32 to 0 53 m d and 0 03 0 07 l s m moderate permeability indicating that the system may be dominated by permeable features i e primary and tectonic fractures sahu et al 2009 groundwater flow predominantly occurs through fractures resulting in a higher potential groundwater flow in aquifer j2a thus j2a groundwater can readily enter j2z groundwater creating a hydraulic connection in contrast the cross correlation function between the groundwater levels of j2a and q4 eol indicates that the delay is around 50 days fig 7a as indicated by the maximum correlation of around 0 7 occurring with a lag of 50 days which indicates that the output signal q4 eol groundwater level responds to the input signal j2a groundwater level after about two months the delay between the j2a and q4 eol groundwater levels was approximately 50 times longer than that between the j2a and j2z groundwater levels the possible reason is the blockage caused by the n2b red clay aquitard between aquifers j2a and q4 eol according to li et al 2011 in northern shaanxi province the hydraulic conductivity of n2b red clay aquitard ranges from 0 00326 to 0 00705 m d indicating poor permeability in this scenario the velocity of groundwater flow in the n2b red clay aquitard would be much slower than that in j2a aquifer thus it is difficult to make a hydraulic connection between aquifers j2a and q4 eol in order to quantify the fluxes of groundwater flow between different aquifers the vertical fluxes per area q were calculated domenico and schwartz 1998 5 q a k h 1 h 2 l a 1 m 2 where q is the vertical fluxes per area between two aquifers a is the area of cross section k is the hydraulic conductivity between two aquifers k is the hydraulic conductivity of the n2b aquitard between aquifers q4 eol and j2a and the hydraulic conductivity of j2a aquifer between j2z and j2a aquifer because j2a and j2z aquifers are in conformable contact h1 h2 is the difference in water level between two aquifers l is the thickness between two aquifers the thickness of n2b aquitard between q4 eol and j2a and the thickness of j2a aquifer between j2z and j2a aquifer as shown in table 4 the q value between aquifers j2z and j2a was obviously larger than that between aquifers q4 eol and j2a indicating a bad hydraulic connection between q4 eol and j2a aquifer and good hydraulic connection between aquifers j2z and j2a in order to verify the correlation between the j2a and j2z groundwater levels the coherence analysis and wavelet coherence analysis were conducted as fig 9a shows the q4 eol and j2a groundwater levels had poor coherence at multiple frequencies especially the tidal band at 1 93 cpd m2 tide the amplitude of m2 represents aquifer confinement aquifer q4 eol is unconfined so the poor confinement of q4 eol may lead to decoupling from aquifer j2a consequently the changes in groundwater level in q4 eol will be unlikely to be transmitted by pressure in contrast good coherence between the groundwater levels in wells fhg1 and zlg1 at low frequencies was found fig 9b in hydrology low frequencies are generally affected by long term factors such as precipitation herman et al 2009 so it is inferred that the j2a and j2z aquifer groundwater levels show similar response to precipitation in addition the coherence observed at 0 9 1 cpd and 1 9 2 cpd is higher than that at lower frequencies according to the general characteristics of spectrum analysis 0 9 1 cpd and 1 9 2 cpd correspond to the main frequencies of the earth tide and barometric pressure response k1 1 002 cpd o1 0 93 cpd m2 1 93 cpd s2 2 cpd xue et al 2016 fig 8 the high coherence at these frequencies indicates that the j2a and j2z groundwater level both are likely to be associated with the earth tide and barometric pressure since the coherence function indicates whether the changes in the output series correspond to the same type of changes in the input signal zhang 2010 in fig 10 the water levels in wells fhg1 and zlg1 are highly coherent at a 95 confidence level the coherence coefficients are 0 9 within the band between 0 5 and 1 days corresponding to the main periods of the earth tide and barometric pressure responses k1 0 997 days o1 1 076 days m2 0 518 days s2 0 5 days the arrows are mainly pointing right in the wavelet coherence analysis indicating a good positive correlation and short lag time between the water levels in wells fhg1 and zlg1 zhang et al 2019 the study wells fhg1 and zlg1 were nearly 100 m apart both the coherence and wavelet coherence analysis results show that there is high coherence in the frequency bands of 0 9 1 cpd and 1 9 2 cpd which are dominated by the tidal and barometric pressure effects indicating confinement of the aquifer thus the possibility of natural leakage is low furthermore a good correlation between fhg1 and zlg3 7 km apart was found and natural leakage between them is negligible in this case the correlation between fhg1 and zlg1 is similar to that of fhg1 and zlg3 indicating that the influence of natural leakage is negligible although the high coherence between the groundwater levels in aquifers j2a and j2z with barometric pressure and tide indeed indicate aquifer confinement it is not due to a good hydraulic connection between the aquifers according to previous studies in a perfectly confined aquifer groundwater flow only occurs within the aquifer and there is no vertical leakage due to the pore elastic deformation caused by barometric pressure and tidal strain thus no hydraulic connection could be found hsieh et al 1987 wang et al 2018 for a purely unconfined aquifer only vertical hydraulic diffusion occurs due to pore elastic deformation roeloffs 1996 however most natural aquifers are neither perfectly confined at the tidal and barometric pressure frequency nor purely unconfined but are somewhere in between wang et al 2018 thus vertical leakage also exists in these aquifers even when they show a barometric pressure or tidal response which means that a hydraulic connection exists in these aquifers the calculations of the vertical fluxes between different aquifers also show that the vertical fluxes between aquifers j2a and j2z are significantly larger than those of aquifers q4 eol and j2a table 4 indicating that there is a hydraulic connection between aquifers j2a and j2z in conclusion the correlation analysis shows that there is a strong correlation between j2a and j2z groundwater in both the time and frequency domain indicating the presence of hydraulic connection in order to verify the reasonability of correlation analysis on identifying hydraulic connection the traditional method pumping tests were carried out in the study area peng et al 2019 two sets of pumping tests were performed to detect the hydraulic connection between q4 eol and j2a aquifers and j2a and j2z aquifers as shown in fig 15a the static observation depth of groundwater level in q4 eol aquifer is 13 1 m but without decline after the pumping maximum pumping depth reached 74 m in j2a aquifer indicating the poor hydraulic connection between q4 eol and j2a aquifers by contrast the static observation depth of groundwater level in j2a aquifer is 5 2 m but show obvious variation approximate 1 01 m after the pumping maximum pumping depth reached 56 m in j2z aquifer fig 15b it indicated good hydraulic connection with a small delay 1 day between j2a and j2z groundwater level which is consistent with correlation analysis above 5 2 2 hydraulic connection under drainage disturbance as discussed above the purpose of this study was to investigate the hydraulic connection among different overburden aquifers in caojiatan coalfield during the study period the groundwater levels in wells ssg3 fhg1 fhg3 zlg1 and zlg3 were stable without any large changes however the groundwater level in well zlg2 showed abnormal changes after april 2019 well zlg2 is located approximately 50 m from a drainage pumping room fig 2 and is far away from the other wells 2km thus drainage disturbance only had a large impact on the groundwater level in zlg2 since there were no other wells within 2 km of the pumping room we cannot determine the range of disturbance distances exactly in order to investigate whether correlation analysis can provide useful information about the changes of hydraulic connection affected by drainage disturbance we analyzed water level data collected before and after drainage to quantify the impacts of human activity on the hydraulic connection between different aquifers the changes in hydrogeological properties and hydrological responses to external loading e g precipitation earth tides or barometric pressure before and after drainage were characterized and compared to provide a better understanding of the hydraulic connections and how they are affected by drainage cross correlation analysis was performed on time series of groundwater levels in wells fhg1 and zlg2 for selected periods of time where continuous water level data were available as fig 11 a shows the cross correlation function between fhg1 and zlg2 was positive prior to drainage with a maximum of 0 9 meanwhile the delay is closed to zero indicating a good hydraulic response between j2a and j2z groundwater however the graph fig 11b shows different behavior with respect to the post disturbance condition the maximum cross correlation function was reduced to 0 48 which is 47 lower than that pre disturbance this sharp drop in the correlation in the time domain can be interpreted in terms of variation in groundwater level groundwater levels in wells fhg1 and zlg2 were stable under natural conditions with only low fluctuation due to water exchange between aquifers or the micro dynamics caused by earth tides or barometric pressure however the groundwater level in well zlg2 showed a significant decline from 1190 m to 1160 m after mine drainage disturbance as an independent signal the strong disturbance of mine drainage can break the correlation between the input and output signals in this system although the fhg1 groundwater level remained stable over the entire study period the drainage disturbance induced a significant change in the zlg2 groundwater level which would weaken the cross correlation between the two in addition to cross correlation analysis coherence analysis and wavelet coherence analysis were used to further explain the results of the cross correlation analysis fig 12 shows variations in the coherence function for pre and post disturbance drainage conditions in fig 12a at a 95 confidence level high coherence was observed between the input fhg1 groundwater level and output zlg2 groundwater level signals at multiple frequencies before drainage disturbance in contrast the coherence function at a 95 confidence level decreased after drainage fig 12b with the ranges of 0 58 0 7 and 0 74 0 88 at frequencies 0 9 1 cpd and 1 9 2 cpd respectively decreasing to 0 06 0 08 and 0 07 0 1 fig 12 indicating less coherence between the input and output signals in addition it can be seen that the water levels in wells fhg1 and zlg2 were highly coherent at a 95 confidence level with coherence coefficients 0 9 within the band between 0 5 and 1 days around the semidiurnal and diurnal components before april 2019 fig 13 in the wavelet coherence analysis the arrows are mainly pointing right indicating a good positive correlation and short lag time between the water levels in wells fhg1 and zlg2 before april 2019 however after the drainage disturbance april 2019 the coherence coefficients decreased from 0 9 to 0 4 within the 0 5 1 day period previous studies have concluded that a sharp drop in groundwater level caused by external disturbance has a great impact on the tidal and barometric pressure responses of a well s water level zhang et al 2019 the possible reason is that human activities have caused atmospheric pressure to enter the aquifer through extraction tunnels or other passages which counteracts the effect of atmospheric pressure on the aquifer so the barometric effect disappears and the confinement of the aquifer gets worse in addition drainage that induces a large decline in water level may affect the pore pressure david et al 2017 so the tidal inducement of the transmission of strain may be disturbed consequently the tidal response of water level may disappear after drainage disturbance 6 conclusions based on hydrochemical methods and correlation analysis this study investigated the hydraulic connections between overburden aquifers in caojiatan coalfield the results show that the hydrochemical type and hydrogen and oxygen isotope characteristics in the j2a weathered bedrock aquifer are close to those of the j2z sandstone aquifer indicative of a hydraulic connection between them the results of cross correlation and coherence analysis show that the groundwater levels in aquifers j2a and j2z are highly cross correlated with a rapid response speed and long response time meanwhile the groundwater levels in j2a and j2z show good coherence at multiple frequencies in conclusion it can be inferred that continuous long term monitoring of groundwater levels and hydrochemical data is required to investigate the hydraulic connections between overburden aquifers hydrochemical methods and correlation analysis can identify such connections in addition correlation analysis can also investigate changes in hydraulic connections caused by mine drainage or other disturbances thereby providing a reference for mining safety of course it is necessary to fully understand the hydrogeological conditions of the study area beforehand this study will be a useful reference for the regular investigations of hydraulic connections in other coalfields credit authorship contribution statement shen qu methodology data curation formal analysis writing original draft investigation zheming shi

4829,with the increase of the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation in the context of global warming the subsequent impact on groundwater ecosystem is urgently needed to be investigated to understand the impact of heavy rain event hre on groundwater microbial communities sampling campaigns were conducted at xikuangshan xks the world largest antimony deposit in dry period dp without precipitation and wet period with an hre respectively samples were subsequently subjected to high throughput sequencing function prediction by faprotax and physicochemical properties analysis results demonstrated that hre significantly shifted the bacterial compositions potential functions and microbial interactions betaproteobacteria dominated in dp whereas gammaproteobacteria was abundant in hre microbial functions such as aromatic compound degradation nitrate reduction sulfate respiration and methanol oxidation were enriched in hre moreover hre also disturbed microbial interactions and resulted in a loosely connected and less stable co occurrence network of bacterial communities multiple variables such as ph sb po4 3 eh ect controlled groundwater bacterial communities and predicted functions during hre and dp whereas sb concentration was the most important one our results firstly demonstrated that hre results in significant variations in the composition potential functions and interactions of bacterial communities in high sb groundwater and enhanced our understanding on the response of microbial community to extreme precipitation in the context of global warming keywords xikuangshan antinomy mine deposit groundwater microbial communities environmental factors heavy rain event microbial interaction 1 introduction antimony sb a metalloid is one of the priority pollutants listed by european union and the united states li 2015 which can cause serious environmental issues and pose health threats on human beings smichowski 2008 sb in high concentration has been demonstrated to significantly impact on microbial communities in soils and sediments hamamura et al 2013 lehr et al 2007 shen et al 2013 meanwhile microorganisms are also actively involved in the biogeochemical processes of sb including transformation li et al 2015a nies 1999 uptake hamamura et al 2013 meng et al 2004 yang et al 2013 oxidation lehr et al 2007 li et al 2015a and release from sb bearing minerals and rocks loni et al 2020 sb contamination in groundwater has also been reported in several locations around the world fu et al 2010 johannesson and tang 2009 kawamoto and morisawa 2003 smichowski 2008 ungureanu et al 2015 wen et al 2016 however microbial communities are far less investigated in groundwater with sb contamination moreover the routine snap shot sampling strategy to some extent limits our understanding about the microbial variations under different climate scenarios such as heavy rain event hre which could have massively impact on groundwater microbial communities yang et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 local rainfall is highly connected with groundwater via recharge during rainy seasons which was mainly responsible for the seasonal variation of water table level deng et al 2014 gao et al 2010 ma et al 2011 water table fluctuation fundamentally controls the redox condition and thus impacts on geochemical processes of arsenic antimony and iron as well as other elements tong et al 2014a 2014b besides the impact on water table level hre can also result in sharp changes of physicochemical properties for example hre can result in notable changes in physicochemical properties including ph electrical conductivity ec po4 3 so4 2 and contaminant contents mohamed et al 2014 which would subsequently shift bacterial abundance and community constituents sugiyama et al 2016 with the increase of frequency and magnitude of hre in south china under the scenario of global warming allan and soden 2008 it is of significance to investigate the influence of hre on groundwater microbial communities particularly at the area with sb contamination to evaluate the impact of climate change on groundwater ecosystems groundwater in xks the world largest sb deposit with a long mining history is contaminated with sb the averaged sb concentration in groundwater in xks was 24 7 μg l which was much higher than the regulation value 5 0 μg l of wto and chinese government fu et al 2016 wen et al 2016 xks has several aquifers and some of them are located in the ledges such as the lower shetianqiao karst aquifer and the upper magunao karst aquifer wen et al 2017 2016 the groundwater level indicates remarkable seasonal variation due to the seasonal precipitation rainy season leads to the sharp rise of the groundwater level and dramatic increase in water flow generally the monthly and annual variations of the groundwater level are 2 4 m and 7 6 m respectively wen 2017 this provides us to a great chance to investigate the influence of hre on groundwater level and related physic chemistry under the scenario of enhanced precipitation in context of global warming particularly in sb contaminated groundwater ecosystems to date great achievements have been made on the isolation identification of antimony oxidizing bacteria and the molecular mechanism of antimonite oxidation via proteomics and genomics hamamura et al 2013 luo et al 2014 meanwhile studies about microbial communities in contaminated river sediments and soils around mining areas also enhanced our knowledge about microbial diversity in natural environments with high sb kataoka et al 2018 sun et al 2019 wang et al 2018 however microbial communities and their correlation with environmental factors in groundwater at xks mining area is far less studied particularly the impact of hre on groundwater microbial communities in this study we hypothesize that at xks mining area 1 hre significantly shifts the composition and functions of microbial communities in groundwater 2 sb concentration fundamentally constructs the groundwater microbial communities our efforts in this study will offer new knowledge about the impact of hre on microbial diversity potential functions and their correlation with environmental factors in groundwater with high concentration of antimony 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of sampling site the xikuangshan xks sb

physicochemical characteristics of groundwater samples water samples were moderately alkaline with ph ranged between 7 40 and 8 92 across the heavy rain event hre and dry period dp tables s1 and s2 eh

difference was observed in other physicochemical properties in hre ph correlated with the concentrations of sb and po4 3 negatively p 0 01 whilst it was positively correlated with the concentrations of as and so4 2 p 0 01 table s3 significant positive correlations were observed between the concentration of po4 3 and eh p 0 01 no3 p 0 01 and mg2 p 0 05 table s3 in dp ph negatively correlated with the concentrations of sb po4 3 and ca2 table s4 whereas significant positive correlations were observed between the concentration of as and ec p 0 01 po4 3 p 0 01 table s4 3 2 structure of microbial communities shannon wiener index was over 4 in both sampling periods fig 2 a and higher in hre than that in dp fig 2b microbial communities were dominated by proteobacteria at the phylum level fig s1a with a relative abundance over 50 in all samples and at the class level the top 10 otus in proteobacteria accounted for 85 13 of all otus overall samples in hre had lower abundance of betaproteobacteria and higher abundance of gammaproteobacteria than those in dp fig s1b heatmap analysis showed the shift of microbial community cluster during hre fig 3 a bacterial phyla such as fusobacteria verrucomicrobia and aquificae in sample 4 5 were enriched during hre compared with those in dp at the same sites fig 3a bacteroidetes in sample 5 omnitrophica in sample 1 and 2 were enriched during dp a similar phenomena was also observed at the genu level fig s3 the relative abundances of phyla such as bacteroidetes omnitrophica dhveg 6 tm6 diapherotrites spirochaetes and classes such as sphingobacteriia bacterioidia and negativicutes were statistically different between hre and dp fig 3b differences in microbial communities among samples were revealed by the pcoa plots fig 4 a overall bacterial communities were clearly distinguished between sampling periods despite of some overlap between hre and dp the two axes of pcoa explained 25 8 of the total variation among different communities fig 4a the loading bar of samples in pcoa were shown in table s8 permanova analysis showed that microbial communities had significant difference between hre and dp with p 0

samples collected in hre axis 1 and axis 2 explained 45 2 and 5 9 of the variation respectively fig 5 a sb showed a strong impact p 0 002 on microbial communities which explained 22 8 of the variation fig 5a gammaproteobacteria and op3 positively correlated with sb concentration in hre table s5 besides sb ph and concentrations of mg2 and po4 3 significantly p 0 05 controlled the microbial communities in groundwater of xks with an explanation of 9 2 4 2 and 0 2 of the variation respectively fig 5a for samples collected in dp axis 1 and axis 2 of the rda plot explained 49 9 and 15 5 of the variation respectively fig 5c sb also showed a strong impact p 0 002 on microbial communities which explained 32 4 of the variation ph and concentrations of po4 3 also significantly p 0 05 controlled the microbial communities with an explanation of 5 3 and 8 1 respectively acidobacteria deltaproteobacteria and op3 positively correlated with sb concentration in dp table s5 as for the denoted functions in hre axis 1 and axis 2 of the rda plot fig 5b explained 32 9 of and 20 2 of the variation respectively sb also significantly impacted p 0 002 on potential functions of microbial communities with an explanation of 20 6 besides sb ph and concentrations of as and po4 3 also significantly p 0 05 impacted on the denoted functions in groundwater with an explanation of 8 3 14 1 and 16 0 respectively on the contrast axis 1 and axis 2 of the rda plot fig 5d explained 30 6 of and 26 6 of the variation in potential functions respectively for samples collected in dp sb p 0 01 and po4 3 concentration p 0 01 significantly controlled denoted functions which explained 19 0 and 13 0 of their variation some potential functions showed significant correlations with environmental factors table s6 for example dark thiosulfate oxidation negatively correlated with sb concentration but positively with as in hre nitrification and respiration of sulfur compounds positively correlated with sb concentration in dp 3 4 co occurrence networks of bacterial communities co occurrence networks of bacterial communities in hre showed a well modularity with 6 modules in total more positive links were observed among different modules indicating a synchronic response to environmental changes key nodes with degrees 50 were affiliated with the phyla of firmicutes deinococcus thermus bacteroidetes lentisphaerae gemmatimonadetes and proteobacteria in hre fig 6 a and 6c most parameters of the network such as average degree closeness centrality eigenvector centrality density average clustering coefficient and average path length were lower than those of the co occurrence network in dp expect the average path length table 2 six modules were also observed in the occurrence network of bacterial communities in dp fig 6b which were more positively connected with each other compared with the networks of hre the key nodes in dp were more diverse and fell into actinobacteria chloroflexi proteobacteria acidobacteria verrucomicrobia microgenomates and nitrospirae fig 6d most indexes of the network were higher than those in hre except the average path length table 2 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of hre on groundwater microbial communities both microbial communities and their predicted functions were clearly distinguished by sampling periods e g hre and dp as indicated by pcoa fig 4 which demonstrated shifts both in bacterial communities and their functions due to the hre recently the impacts of extreme rainfall event on physicochemical properties and community structures have been confirmed in the groundwater of a deep aquifer in uk reiss et al 2019 hre can significantly change the physicochemical parameters in a relatively short time reiss et al 2019 the most dramatic variation observed during hre in our study is the significant decrease of eh due to the increase of water table and depletion of dissolved oxygen in groundwater which were also observed in previous studies kelly 2001 redox potential has been confirmed to significantly control the oxidation state of antimony and arsenic armiento et al 2017 guo et al 2012 masscheleyn et al 1991 and microbial groups involved in the biogeochemical reactions husson 2013 li et al 2015b in this study decreased eh in hre resulted in the enrichment of autotrophic anaerobic betaproteobacteria table s7 which use bicarbonate or carbon dioxide as carbon sources and nitrite ammonium thiosulfate or sulfide as electron donors garrity et al 2005 for example rhodocyclales was anaerobe commonly found in sediment aquatic and anaerobic mud george et al 2005 heavy rain event may also increase fecal microorganisms such as escherichia coli of the class gammaproteobacteria in groundwater as we observed in this study 0 1 in dp vs 1 2 in hre due to the rapid flow of rainwater into the shallow aquifer sugiyama et al 2016 moreover our statistical analysis confirmed the significant negative and positive impacts of eh on concentrations of as and sb in this study tables s3 and s4 therefore we surmise the clear shifts in microbial communities may result from the impact of hre on physicochemical properties of groundwater furthermore hre may also change microbial potential functions such functions as aromatic compound degradation nitrate reduction nitrate respiration nitrogen respiration sulfate respiration methanol oxidation and methylotrophy fig s2 were enriched in hre other functions such as denitrifying and sulfate reduction also are enhanced during hre as confirmed by other research zhou et al 2015 besides the impact of hre on microbial communities and their potential functions hre also resulted in a different co occurrence network of bacterial communities fig 6 hre diluted and scattered some microbial groups in groundwater fig 6a and 6c due to the large recharge of rainfall in a short time datry et al 2004 sugiyama et al 2016 phylum microgenomates as a significant fraction of the microbial populations in groundwater systems danczak et al 2017 usually serve as key node in the network fig 6b and d however hre sharply changed the microbial communities as well as their potential functions fig 6a and c subsequently lead to the changes in co occurrence network for example nitrospirae and verrucomicrobia lost their degree edge number linked with a node from dp to hre whereas the degrees of deinococcus thermus and bacteroidetes increased this was consistent with the increase in their relative abundances decreased eh in hre is favored for anaerobic bacteroidetes du et al 2014 but not for aerobic nitrospirae zhou et al 2015 the network of microbial communities in hre was characterized with low degree low closeness centrality and low eigenvector centrality table 2 which confirmed a loosely connected and less stable network 4 2 impact of environmental factors on groundwater microbial communities multiple variables such as sb and ph have been confirmed to construct bacterial communities in soils and sediments with high sb hamamura et al 2013 shen et al 2013 sun et al 2019 xiao et al 2017 for example microbial diversity is reduced significantly in soils contaminated with as and sb sun et al 2019 our results showed that sb greatly shaped the composition of microbial communities in groundwater samples fig 5 and selected highly specific microbial groups with a z value 3 fig 3 despite of different sampling periods groundwater samples with high sb concentrations were characterized by specific groups of chlamydiae actinobacteria and acidobacteria which were also observed in heavily contaminated soils with antimony luo et al 2014 at the genus level fig s3 most specific groups belonged to alphaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria which can survive in polluted environments mbadinga et al 2011 sangwan et al 2015 shi et al 2013 some of the specific genus such as chromobacterium lysobacter bdellovibrio sphingobium clostridium and limnobacter were also reported in environments with sb or as contaminations ciprandi et al 2012 liu et al 2015 sangwan et al 2015 shi et al 2013 moreover sb also showed significant impacts on microbial potential functions despite of the different sampling periods fig 5b and d albeit the impact of sb during hre was weakened overall sb and po4 3 showed significant positive impacts on most potential functions in dp fig 5d whereas microbial functions were more scattered in the rda plot and controlled by more environmental variables in hre fig 5b and table s6 in fact dark thiosulfate oxidation and sulfate reduction were confirmed to be coupled with sb cycling wen et al 2016 nitrate ammonification and nitrification were significantly positively correlated with the concentration of sb table s6 in dp whereas nitrification had significant correlation with as in hre few functions link with sb were detected due to the lack of knowledge on functional genes responsible for sb cycling hill et al 2016 beside sb concentration ph was another significant factor impacting microbial communities in our study with an explanation of 9 2 in hre and 5 3 in dp in fact ph has been widely demonstrated to be a crucial environmental factor controlling soil microbial communities at global regional and local scales and across different habitats gong et al 2015 liu et al 2014 yun et al 2016 furthermore ph also significantly shape aquatic microbial communities griebler and lueders 2010 our groundwater was generally neutral or weakly alkaline which was similar with water ph values in other typical antimony mining area ashley et al 2003 2006 flakova et al 2012 which mainly result from the neutralization of carbonate rocks ashley et al 2006 flakova et al 2012 getaneh and alemayehu 2006 water ph can explain 37 44 of the variation in microbial community structure in the shallow aquifers underlying sugarcane and banana fields wakelin et al 2011 in dp ph positively correlated with the abundance of alphaproteobacteria p 0 004 r2 0 359 and bacteroidets p 0 00018 r2 0 531 whereas negatively impacted on gammaproteobacteria p 0 009 r2 0 306 these observations were coincided by the study of near surface groundwater microbiomes yan et al 2020 the decrease of gammaproteobacteria with the increase of ph resulted in a lower ratio of gammaproteobacteria to betaproteobacteria in groundwater samples fig s1 compared that under neutral conditions this observation was consistent with the result of previous study on groundwater microbial communities geesink et al 2018 in fact each microbial group has its own optimal ph conditions for growth therefore different ph values in natural environments would favor for different microbial groups besides the direct impact of ph on bacterial communities ph may also shift bacterial compositions via indirect impact on other physicochemical parameters for example ph greatly impacts the release adsorption oxidation and bioavailability of sb he et al 2019 zheng et al 2006 which subsequently impact on bacterial communities ph also affects the adsorption of sb on a variety of adsorbents he et al 2019 which is closely linked to the bioavailability of sb and thus indirectly impact on microorganisms in our case ph was found to be significantly related with other environmental variables such as a negative correlation with sb concentration p 0 017 r2 0 265 po4 3 p 0 001 r2 0 634 and eh p 2 8596e 11 r2 0 908 in all samples tables s3 and s4 other environmental factors such as po4 3 mg2 no3 and eh also affected microbial communities in groundwater of xks po4 3 is an important nutrient for microbial growth and superfluous input of phosphorous into the river and lakes will result in algae bloom anderson et al 2002 sampling sites 1 and 2 were geographically close to the residential area and people usually washed their clothes in the rivers which leads to the elevated concentration of po4 3 holman et al 2008 microbial communities at these two sites were characterized by high biomass and low diversity as indicated by the relative high dna concentration recovered from a given water volume and high shannon wiener index in dp po4 3 at these two sites was much lower which resulted in an obvious shift of composition and diversity of microbial communities as revealed by heatmap fig 3 average concentration of no3 was higher in hre than in dp table 1 which showed significant correlation with potential functions of bacterial communities in hre fig 5 although nitrate was a popular electron acceptor for microbes under anaerobic conditions it did not show a statistically significant impact on the microbial community structures 4 3 implication extreme precipitation event is proposed to occur with high frequencies and large amplitude with the scenario of global warming allan and soden 2008 due to the active interaction between surface water and groundwater especially at karst area extreme precipitation events would dramatically impact on the groundwater table as well as groundwater physicochemical properties deng et al 2014 besides that we found that heavy rain event also significantly impacts on microbial ecosystems in groundwater hre shifted the composition and potential functions of bacterial communities furthermore hre would disrupt microbial interactions and make the microbial network unstable flood like what happened in yangtze river region in the summer of 2020 might damage microbial ecosystem completely although we observed the impact of sb on microbial communities is weakened during hre how microbial variation during hre impact on sb geochemical behavior still remains mysterious at this moment and merits further investigation our results offer new knowledge about how hre impacts underground water ecosystem and give us some clues to evaluate the impact of global warm on subsurface biosphere 5 conclusion this is the first study which reported the impacts of heavy rain event hre on microbial communities in sb contaminated groundwater at xks our results confirmed that hre strongly shifted microbial communities in composition function and interaction among different groups phyla such as bacteroidetes omnitrophica dhveg 6 tm6 diapherotrites and spirochaetes were enriched in hre microbial functions such as aromatic compound degradation nitrate reduction sulfate respiration and methanol oxidation were enriched in hre hre disturbed microbial interactions and resulted in a less stable network multiple environmental variables such as sb ph eh po4 3 mg2 and as constructed microbial communities in groundwater at xks mining area with sb as the most important one although the impact of sb was weakened during hre gammaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria were positively correlating with sb concentration which indicated the high potential of their involvement in the biogeochemistry of sb in natural ecosystems our results offer valuable information to understand the variation in bacterial communities and their roles in elemental cycling in term of enhanced precipitation with the scenario of global warming and high frequency

level deng et al 2014 gao et al 2010 ma et al 2011 water table fluctuation fundamentally controls the redox condition and thus impacts on geochemical processes of arsenic antimony and iron as well as other elements tong et al 2014a 2014b besides the impact on water table level hre can also result in sharp changes of physicochemical properties for example hre can result in notable changes in physicochemical properties including ph electrical conductivity ec po4 3 so4 2 and contaminant contents mohamed et al 2014 which would subsequently shift bacterial abundance and community constituents sugiyama et al 2016 with the increase of frequency and magnitude of hre in south china under the scenario of global warming allan and soden 2008 it is of significance to investigate the influence of hre on groundwater microbial communities particularly at the area with sb contamination to evaluate the impact of climate change on groundwater ecosystems groundwater in xks the world largest sb deposit with a long mining history is contaminated with sb the averaged sb concentration in groundwater in xks was 24 7 μg l which was much higher than the regulation value 5 0 μg l of wto and chinese government fu et al 2016 wen et al 2016 xks has several aquifers and some of them are located in the ledges such as the lower shetianqiao karst aquifer and the upper magunao karst aquifer wen et al 2017 2016 the groundwater level indicates remarkable seasonal variation due to the seasonal precipitation rainy season leads to the sharp rise of the groundwater level and dramatic increase in water flow generally the monthly and annual variations of the groundwater level are 2 4 m and 7 6 m respectively wen 2017 this provides us to a great chance to investigate the influence of hre on groundwater level and related physic chemistry under the scenario of enhanced precipitation in context of global warming particularly in sb contaminated groundwater ecosystems to date great achievements have been made on the isolation identification of antimony oxidizing bacteria and the molecular mechanism of antimonite oxidation via proteomics and genomics hamamura et al 2013 luo et al 2014 meanwhile studies about microbial communities in contaminated river sediments and soils around mining areas also enhanced our knowledge about microbial diversity in natural environments with high sb kataoka et al 2018 sun et al 2019 wang et al 2018 however microbial communities and their correlation with environmental factors in groundwater at xks mining area is far less studied particularly the impact of hre on groundwater microbial communities in this study we hypothesize that at xks mining area 1 hre significantly shifts the composition and functions of microbial communities in groundwater 2 sb concentration fundamentally constructs the groundwater microbial communities our efforts in this study will offer new knowledge about the impact of hre on microbial diversity potential functions and their correlation with environmental factors in groundwater with high concentration of antimony 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of sampling site the xikuangshan xks sb

physicochemical characteristics of groundwater samples water samples were moderately alkaline with ph ranged between 7 40 and 8 92 across the heavy rain event hre and dry period dp tables s1 and s2 eh dramatically increased from 45 2 mv to 89 5 mv in hre to 127 9 mv to 24 1 mv in dp tables s1 and s2 and showed significant difference between hre and dp table 1 as indicated by anova no significant difference was observed in other physicochemical properties in hre ph correlated with the concentrations of sb and po4 3 negatively p 0 01 whilst it was positively correlated with the concentrations of as and so4 2 p 0 01 table s3 significant positive correlations were observed between the concentration of po4 3 and eh p 0 01 no3 p 0 01 and mg2 p 0 05 table s3 in dp ph negatively correlated with the concentrations of sb po4 3 and ca2 table s4 whereas significant positive correlations were observed between the concentration of as and ec p 0 01 po4 3 p 0 01 table s4 3 2 structure of microbial communities shannon wiener index was over 4 in both sampling periods fig 2 a and higher in hre than that in dp fig 2b microbial communities were dominated by proteobacteria at the phylum level fig s1a with a relative abundance over 50 in all samples and at the class level the top 10 otus in proteobacteria accounted for 85 13 of all otus overall samples in hre had lower abundance of betaproteobacteria and higher abundance of gammaproteobacteria than those in dp fig s1b heatmap analysis showed the shift of microbial community cluster during hre fig 3 a bacterial phyla such as fusobacteria verrucomicrobia and aquificae in sample 4 5 were enriched during hre compared with those in dp at the same sites fig 3a bacteroidetes in sample 5 omnitrophica in sample 1 and 2 were enriched during dp a similar phenomena was also observed at the genu level fig s3 the relative abundances of phyla such as bacteroidetes omnitrophica dhveg 6 tm6 diapherotrites spirochaetes and classes such as sphingobacteriia bacterioidia and negativicutes were statistically different between hre and dp fig 3b differences in microbial communities among samples were revealed by the pcoa plots fig 4 a overall bacterial communities were clearly distinguished between sampling periods despite of some overlap between hre and dp the two axes of pcoa explained 25 8 of the total variation among different communities fig 4a the loading bar of samples in pcoa were shown in table s8 permanova analysis showed that microbial communities had significant difference between hre and dp with p 0 03 fig 4a similarly potential functions annotated by faprotax also fell into 2 groups clearly according to sampling periods hre and dp and the two axes of pcoa explained 31 05 of the variation fig 4b 3 3 relationship among environmental factors microbial communities and potential functions rda results showed that multiple factors significantly impacted on microbial communities in groundwater for samples collected in hre axis 1 and axis 2 explained 45 2 and 5 9 of the variation respectively fig 5 a sb showed a strong impact p 0 002 on microbial communities which explained 22 8 of the variation fig 5a gammaproteobacteria and op3 positively correlated with sb concentration in hre table s5 besides sb ph and concentrations of mg2 and po4 3 significantly p 0 05 controlled the microbial communities in groundwater of xks with an explanation of 9 2 4 2 and 0 2 of the variation respectively fig 5a for samples collected in dp axis 1 and axis 2 of the rda plot explained 49 9 and 15 5 of the variation respectively fig 5c sb also showed a strong impact p 0 002 on microbial communities which explained 32 4 of the variation ph and concentrations of po4 3 also significantly p 0 05 controlled the microbial communities with an explanation of 5 3 and 8 1 respectively acidobacteria deltaproteobacteria and op3 positively correlated with sb concentration in dp table s5 as for the denoted functions in hre axis 1 and axis 2 of the rda plot fig 5b explained 32 9 of and 20 2 of the variation respectively sb also significantly impacted p 0 002 on potential functions of microbial communities with an explanation of 20 6 besides sb ph and concentrations of as and po4 3 also significantly p 0 05 impacted on the denoted functions in groundwater with an explanation of 8 3 14 1 and 16 0 respectively on the contrast axis 1 and axis 2 of the rda plot fig 5d explained 30 6 of and 26 6 of the variation in potential functions respectively for samples collected in dp sb p 0 01 and po4 3 concentration p 0 01 significantly controlled denoted functions which explained 19 0 and 13 0 of their variation some potential functions showed significant correlations with environmental factors table s6 for example dark thiosulfate oxidation negatively correlated with sb concentration but positively with as in hre nitrification and respiration of sulfur compounds positively correlated with sb concentration in dp 3 4 co occurrence networks of bacterial communities co occurrence networks of bacterial communities in hre showed a well modularity with 6 modules in total more positive links were observed among different modules indicating a synchronic response to environmental changes key nodes with degrees 50 were affiliated with the phyla of firmicutes deinococcus thermus bacteroidetes lentisphaerae gemmatimonadetes and proteobacteria in hre fig 6 a and 6c most parameters of the network such as average degree closeness centrality eigenvector centrality density average clustering coefficient and average path length were lower than those of the co occurrence network in dp expect the average path length table 2 six modules were also observed in the occurrence network of bacterial communities in dp fig 6b which were more positively connected with each other compared with the networks of hre the key nodes in dp were more diverse and fell into actinobacteria chloroflexi proteobacteria acidobacteria verrucomicrobia microgenomates and nitrospirae fig 6d most indexes of the network were higher than those in hre except the average path length table 2 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of hre on groundwater microbial communities both microbial communities and their predicted functions were clearly distinguished by sampling periods e g hre and dp as indicated by pcoa fig 4 which demonstrated shifts both in bacterial communities and their functions due to the hre recently the impacts of extreme rainfall event on physicochemical properties and community structures have been confirmed in the groundwater of a deep aquifer in uk reiss et al 2019 hre can significantly change the physicochemical parameters in a relatively short time reiss et al 2019 the most dramatic variation observed during hre in our study is the significant decrease of eh due to the increase of water table and depletion of dissolved oxygen in groundwater which were also observed in previous studies kelly 2001 redox potential has been confirmed to significantly control the oxidation state of antimony and arsenic armiento et al 2017 guo et al 2012 masscheleyn et al 1991 and microbial groups involved in the biogeochemical reactions husson 2013 li et al 2015b in this study decreased eh in hre resulted in the enrichment of autotrophic anaerobic betaproteobacteria table s7 which use bicarbonate or carbon dioxide as carbon sources and nitrite ammonium thiosulfate or sulfide as electron donors garrity et al 2005 for example rhodocyclales was anaerobe commonly found in sediment aquatic and anaerobic mud george et al 2005 heavy rain event may also increase fecal microorganisms such as escherichia coli of the class gammaproteobacteria in groundwater as we observed in this study 0 1 in dp vs 1 2 in hre due to the rapid flow of rainwater into the shallow aquifer sugiyama et al 2016 moreover our statistical analysis confirmed the significant negative and positive impacts of eh on concentrations of as and sb in this study tables s3 and s4 therefore we surmise the clear shifts in microbial communities may result from the impact of hre on physicochemical properties of groundwater furthermore hre may also change microbial potential functions such functions as aromatic compound degradation nitrate reduction nitrate respiration nitrogen respiration sulfate respiration methanol oxidation and methylotrophy fig s2 were enriched in hre other functions such as denitrifying and sulfate reduction also are enhanced during hre as confirmed by other research zhou et al 2015 besides the impact of hre on microbial communities and their potential functions hre also resulted in a different co occurrence network of bacterial communities fig 6 hre diluted and scattered some microbial groups in groundwater fig 6a and 6c due to the large recharge of rainfall in a short time datry et al 2004 sugiyama et al 2016 phylum microgenomates as a significant fraction of the microbial populations in groundwater systems danczak et al 2017 usually serve as key node in the network fig 6b and d however hre sharply changed the microbial communities as well as their potential functions fig 6a and c subsequently lead to the changes in co occurrence network for example nitrospirae and verrucomicrobia lost their degree edge number linked with a node from dp to hre whereas the degrees of deinococcus thermus and bacteroidetes increased this was consistent with the increase in their relative abundances decreased eh in hre is favored for anaerobic bacteroidetes du et al 2014 but not for aerobic nitrospirae zhou et al 2015 the network of microbial communities in hre was characterized with low degree low closeness centrality and low eigenvector centrality table 2 which confirmed a loosely connected and less stable network 4 2 impact of environmental factors on groundwater microbial communities multiple variables such as sb and ph have been confirmed to construct bacterial communities in soils and sediments with high sb hamamura et al 2013 shen et al 2013 sun et al 2019 xiao et al 2017 for example microbial diversity is reduced significantly in soils contaminated with as and sb sun et al 2019 our results showed that sb greatly shaped the composition of microbial communities in groundwater samples fig 5 and selected highly specific microbial groups with a z value 3 fig 3 despite of different sampling periods groundwater samples with high sb concentrations were characterized by specific groups of chlamydiae actinobacteria and acidobacteria which were also observed in heavily contaminated soils with antimony luo et al 2014 at the genus level fig s3 most specific groups belonged to alphaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria which can survive in polluted environments mbadinga et al 2011 sangwan et al 2015 shi et al 2013 some of the specific genus such as chromobacterium lysobacter bdellovibrio sphingobium clostridium and limnobacter were also reported in environments with sb or as contaminations ciprandi et al 2012 liu et al 2015 sangwan et al 2015 shi et al 2013 moreover sb also showed significant impacts on microbial potential functions despite of the different sampling periods fig 5b and d albeit the impact of sb during hre was weakened overall sb and po4 3 showed significant positive impacts on most potential functions in dp fig 5d whereas microbial functions were more scattered in the rda plot and controlled by more environmental variables in hre fig 5b and table s6 in fact dark thiosulfate oxidation and sulfate reduction were confirmed to be coupled with sb cycling wen et al 2016 nitrate ammonification and nitrification were significantly positively correlated with the concentration of sb table s6 in dp whereas nitrification had significant correlation with as in hre few functions link with sb were detected due to the lack of knowledge on functional genes responsible for sb cycling hill et al 2016 beside sb concentration ph was another significant factor impacting microbial communities in our study with an explanation of 9 2 in hre and 5 3 in dp in fact ph has been widely demonstrated to be a crucial environmental factor controlling soil microbial communities at global regional and local scales and across different habitats gong et al 2015 liu et al 2014 yun et al 2016 furthermore ph also significantly shape aquatic microbial communities griebler and lueders 2010 our groundwater was generally neutral or weakly alkaline which was similar with water ph values in other typical antimony mining area ashley et al 2003 2006 flakova et al 2012 which mainly result from the neutralization of carbonate rocks ashley et al 2006 flakova et al 2012 getaneh and alemayehu 2006 water ph can explain 37 44 of the variation in microbial community structure in the shallow aquifers underlying sugarcane and banana fields wakelin et al 2011 in dp ph positively correlated with the abundance of alphaproteobacteria p 0 004 r2 0 359 and bacteroidets p 0 00018 r2 0 531 whereas negatively impacted on gammaproteobacteria p 0 009 r2 0 306 these observations were coincided by the study of near surface groundwater microbiomes yan et al 2020 the decrease of gammaproteobacteria with the increase of ph resulted in a lower ratio of gammaproteobacteria to betaproteobacteria in groundwater samples fig s1 compared that under neutral conditions this observation was consistent with the result of previous study on groundwater microbial communities geesink et al 2018 in fact each microbial group has its own optimal ph conditions for growth therefore different ph values in natural environments would favor for different microbial groups besides the direct impact of ph on bacterial communities ph may also shift bacterial compositions via indirect impact on other physicochemical parameters for example ph greatly impacts the release adsorption oxidation and bioavailability of sb he et al 2019 zheng et al 2006 which subsequently impact on bacterial communities ph also affects the adsorption of sb on a variety of adsorbents he et al 2019 which is closely linked to the bioavailability of sb and thus indirectly impact on microorganisms in our case ph was found to be significantly related with other environmental variables such as a negative correlation with sb concentration p 0 017 r2 0 265 po4 3 p 0 001 r2 0 634 and eh p 2 8596e 11 r2 0 908 in all samples tables s3 and s4 other environmental factors such as po4 3 mg2 no3 and eh also affected microbial communities in groundwater of xks po4 3 is an important nutrient for microbial growth and superfluous input of phosphorous into the river and lakes will result in algae bloom anderson et al 2002 sampling sites 1 and 2 were geographically close to the residential area and people usually washed their clothes in the rivers which leads to the elevated concentration of po4 3 holman et al 2008 microbial communities at these two sites were characterized by high biomass and low diversity as indicated by the relative high dna concentration recovered from a given water volume and high shannon wiener index in dp po4 3 at these two sites was much lower which resulted in an obvious shift of composition and diversity of microbial communities as revealed by heatmap fig 3 average concentration of no3 was higher in hre than in dp table 1 which showed significant correlation with potential functions of bacterial communities in hre fig 5 although nitrate was a popular electron acceptor for microbes under anaerobic conditions it did not show a statistically significant impact on the microbial community structures 4 3 implication extreme precipitation event is proposed to occur with high frequencies and large amplitude with the scenario of global warming allan and soden 2008 due to the active interaction between surface water and groundwater especially at karst area extreme precipitation events would dramatically impact on the groundwater table as well as groundwater physicochemical properties deng et al 2014 besides that we found that heavy rain event also significantly impacts on microbial ecosystems in groundwater hre shifted the composition and potential functions of bacterial communities furthermore hre would disrupt microbial interactions and make the microbial network unstable flood like what happened in yangtze river region in the summer of 2020 might damage microbial ecosystem completely although we observed the impact of sb on microbial communities is weakened during hre how microbial variation during hre impact on sb geochemical behavior still remains mysterious at this moment and merits further investigation our results offer new knowledge about how hre impacts underground water ecosystem and give us some clues to evaluate the impact of global warm on subsurface biosphere 5 conclusion this is the first study which reported the impacts of heavy rain event hre on microbial communities in sb contaminated groundwater at xks our results confirmed that hre strongly shifted microbial communities in composition function and interaction among different groups phyla such as bacteroidetes omnitrophica dhveg 6 tm6 diapherotrites and spirochaetes were enriched in hre microbial functions such as aromatic compound degradation nitrate reduction sulfate respiration and methanol oxidation were enriched in hre hre disturbed microbial interactions and resulted in a less stable network multiple environmental variables such as sb ph eh po4 3 mg2 and as constructed microbial communities in groundwater at xks mining area with sb as the most important one although the impact of sb was weakened during hre gammaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria were positively correlating with sb concentration which indicated the high potential of their involvement in the biogeochemistry of sb in natural ecosystems our results offer valuable information to understand the variation in bacterial communities and their roles in elemental cycling in term of enhanced precipitation with the scenario of global warming and high frequency
