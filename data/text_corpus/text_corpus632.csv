3160,we used stable isotopes to help assess ecohydrological partitioning in different types of urban green space in the city of berlin we focused particularly on the role of the near surface of soils as a crucial interface that determines shallow subsurface non hortonian flows and water cycling in cities grassland soils tended to be wetter than soils under continuous urban tree cover and areas around individual trees in parks or on streets this is consistent with greater interception losses and transpiration from trees soil water isotopes showed distinct seasonality in response to precipitation inputs mixing with resident soil water and the effects of evaporative fractionation effects of fractionation were most marked under individual trees and grasslands where the effects of evaporation on the isotopic composition of percolating water from the upper 0 1 m of the soil was also most pronounced isotope dynamics showed that under all land covers the upper soils had rapid water turnover and were dominated by younger water 2 months old at depths of 0 4 m more damping was evident with water being 6 months old isotopes in plant water also show seasonal variations which were more marked in grasses than trees mixing models revealed that grass most likely recycled shallow younger soil water in transpiration whilst trees were more dependent on deeper older sub soil and groundwater sources these preliminary results highlight the urgent need for a much greater understanding of water movement and cycling in the shallow critical zone of urban green spaces this is essential to manage future resilience to climate change and understand the trade offs between partitioning urban water between evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge keywords urban hydrology

world war ii ywf young water fraction 1 introduction there is increasing awareness of the importance of urban green space in large cities which brings multiple benefits including enhanced biodiversity nielsen et al 2014 greater amenity chen wang 2013 and improved physical and mental health for citizens who 2016 braubach et al 2017 a crucial role of urban green space is its influence on water cycling and the ecohydrological partitioning of rainfall higher rainfall infiltration enhances the retention of water in urban areas both reducing local flood risk le et al 2019 fiori volpi 2020 and increasing soil moisture storage and groundwater recharge dietz 2007 kuhlemann et al 2021a b as a result of this the concept of green infrastructure where green spaces are protected and enhanced for greater water retention to mitigate floods and water scarcity in conurbations is gaining popularity he et al 2021 urban green space also enhances evapotranspiration that can help mitigate the urban heat island effect through cooling from latent heat fluxes at the local gago et al 2013 to city scale oke 1989 consequently the management design and creation of urban green space is a critical component of any urban planning seeking to build resilience to climate change in towns and cities and balance potentially competing water demands it follows that there is an important need to quantify the spatial and temporal variability of ecohydrological partitioning in urban green spaces in large towns and cities this need for a water sensitive urban design generates urgent research challenges in urban hydrology this necessitates moving on from focussing on stormwater management resulting from hortonian overland flow from low permeability surfaces to incorporating a more process based understanding of how water moves through the highly heterogeneous and poorly understood subsurface of urban areas bonneau et al 2018 indeed there is a need to integrate more urban sites into critical zone studies that seek to quantify the cycling of water and elements between the atmosphere soils and vegetation in different geographical settings grant dietrich 2017 tetzlaff et al 2017 currently the ecohydrology of urban green space is poorly understood nouri et al 2016 ward et al 2016 with few investigations into soil water fluxes michopoulos 2011 furthermore the scale of green areas as well as their shape orientation and location in relation to surrounding buildings and river networks can be influential in urban water cycling meili et al 2019 2021 for understanding ecohydrological partitioning and sources of root water uptake under different vegetation communities guderle et al 2018 soil moisture dynamics are key to understanding the interactions between rainfall inputs evaporation and root water uptake albasha et al 2015 thomas et al 2020 the differences in water use between contrasting generic vegetation types e g trees shrubs and grass have been quantified in empirical studies kannenberg et al 2021 kuhlemann et al 2021a b werner et al 2021 whilst only a few modelling studies have resolved rainfall partitioning into interception soil evaporation and transpiration under different urban vegetation e g gillefalk et al 2021a b however most studies to date are small scale and limited in terms of understanding the heterogeneity in large scale urban landscapes one reason is that there are obvious logistical challenges for monitoring risks of vandalism access to privately owned land etc that limit equipment installations stable isotopes of water are effective tracers in urban areas that can capture both the effects of natural urban hydrology involving green spaces and the technical water cycle e g effluent discharges infiltration into sewers and water distribution systems ehleringer et al 2016 kracht 2007 kuhlemann et al 2020 soulsby et al 2014 isotopes can provide powerful insights into water movement through the critical zone in an urban setting from precipitation through the flow paths in soils sprenger et al 2015 groundwater scheliga et al 2017 and vegetation allen et al 2019 sprenger et al 2016 as well as associated mixing processes in each compartment additionally isotopes in urban areas can indicate the effects of artificial irrigation on the isotopic composition of streams fillo et al 2021 via changes in soil water sources of runoff gómez navarro et al 2019 extraction of soil waters for isotope analysis can provide a time integrated insight into subsurface processes such as infiltration of rain evaporation mixing during percolation and the spatio temporal variability of potential sources of root water uptake e g sprenger et al 2019 sources can often be approximated from the sampling of plant xylem water and using mixing models to apportion sources based on soil water isotopes brinkmann et al 2019 evaristo et al 2019 wang et al 2017 here we report a study from parts of central berlin the capital city of germany green space covers 30 of the city varying from large and small parks through extensive gardens and allotments to individual trees widespread damage in berlin during the second world war ww2 and progressive policies to enhance urban green space since the reunification resulted in a bias towards a relatively young tree distribution senuvk 2021a nevertheless tree mortality has been relatively high in berlin particularly following a major drought in 2018 19 raising questions about the current and future resilience of urban vegetation smith et al 2019 the present study builds on previous plot scale studies in berlin gillefalk et al 2021a b kuhlemann et al 2021a b to extend our understanding of ecohydrological partitioning in contrasting green spaces in a major city upscaled over larger areas the specific research questions are 1 how does the soil water content differ in time and space in contrasting areas of urban green space in a major city 2 can soil water stable isotopes show differences in evaporation and the pathways and timescales of subsurface water movement under contrasting green space 3 can isotopes of soil and plant xylem water be used to provide preliminary insights into dominant sources of root water uptake under contrasting urban vegetation types 2 data and methodology as a city berlin fig 1 a has undergone profound land use changes in the

storms while winter is characterized by low intensity frontal rain our study focused on three core experimental sites in green space close to the centre of berlin fig 1 with subsites within each all sites are managed and accessible to the public and while grassland sites were occasionally mown and some trees were subject to occasional pruning discussion with park managers confirmed that none of the sites where isotope sampling was conducted were irrigated vegetation at each site was identified via the greenspace information system gris of berlin and the mobile app pl ntnet joly et al 2014

our core site h encompassing thirteen plots and weekly at eighteen parks including our other two core sites vp and tg encompassing 37 plot sites unfortunately equipment failures and delayed repairs due to the covid pandemic resulted in two major data gaps between june to july 2020 and september to mid october 2020 though the seasonal dynamics as well as short term variability were sufficiently well captured at the reference site at sueo swc was recorded in duplicates at three depths 10 15 40 50 and 90 100 cm in an hourly resolution details in kuhlemann et al 2021a b 3 3 soil water isotopes soil water isotopes were analyzed in vapour extracted from soil samples collected at our three core sites monthly between march and november 2020 each site consisted of two locations 10 m distance with each of these comprising two profiles extracted in close proximity to each other 10 cm we sub sampled at four depths 0 5 5 15 15 25 25 35 cm giving four replicates of each depth from which the two samples in close proximity were combined and analysed in one bag we used a sampling ring for depth until 5 cm below 5 cm we used a soil auger diameter of 4 cm the sampled soil was quickly stored in metalized bags cb400 420siz weber packaging gmbh güglingen germany and zip locked air tight sample collection was not possible in april 2020 due to fieldwork restrictions under the covid 19 lockdown isotope ratios were measured in the laboratory using the direct vapour equilibrium dve method wassenaar et al 2008 soil samples were allowed to equilibrate for 48 h before vapour extraction and analysis all samples contained 2 3 ml of residual water hendry et al 2015 gralher et al 2021 four blocks of three different standards vsmow referred for the dve were set up and were measured with the samples at the beginning the end and during the first and second third of the bags the vapour in each bag was measured for 8 10 min to ensure a stable plateau sdh2oppm 100 for plateau identification gradient and quantile filters were used to create a reliable mean the standards were used for drift control over the measurement and the year and to convert from the vapour phase back into the liquid phase 3 4 plant water isotopes monthly samples for plant water extraction were collected on the same day as soil samples grass samples were taken by clipping grass turf directly above the soil sample location for grass we sampled the hypocotyl the part of the grass between blade and root to minimise the effects of any leaf water which might have been partially transpired twigs from trees table 1 were sampled with telescopic pruning shears samples were frozen on return to the laboratory cryogenic vacuum extraction using the setup and protocol described in koeniger et al 2016 was then used to derive water samples an extraction time of 90 min west et al 2006 was used with an extraction efficiency of 95 99 before the extraction an empty vial is frozen with liquid nitrogen and evacuated by a vacuum pump next the sample is frozen and connected to the evacuated vial via a stainless steel capillary tube koeniger et al 2011 afterwards to extract the water the sample vial was placed in a 105 c heated custom built isolated aluminium block gaj et al 2016 after extraction the xylem water samples were measured using crds l 2130i picarro inc santa clara ca usa precision 0

screened at 4 5 6 5 m b g l with an average groundwater depth of 3 3 m b g l along with the liquid samples from precipitation and xylem water groundwater samples were analyzed using a crds analyzer and referenced to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow standard 3 6 data analysis processing of isotope analysis data and the majority of other data analyses were conducted using r script r version 4 0 4 2021 02 15 r core team 2021 we used wilcoxon signed rank tests to evaluate if groups were statistically different p 0 05 wilcoxon 1945 to quantify variations of dynamics of pooled groups the coefficient of variation between both was calculated which is a unitless normalization of the standard deviation by the mean maity 2022 line conditioned excess lc excess was calculated to show the deviation of isotope samples from the local meteoric water line lmwl due to evaporative fractionation landwehr and coplen 2006 the lmwl was derived from long term data at steglitz kuhlemann et al 2021a b samples with a negative lc excess plot below the lmwl are considered to be fractionated compared to precipitation and groundwater samples which plot along the lmwl the local soil evaporation line lsel eq s1 in supplemental material is based on the craig gordon equation and atmospheric variables were also derived gibson et al 2008 using hydroclimatic variables assuming an isotopic equilibrium in the atmosphere details of the estimation were also reported in the supplemental material eq s2 s4 because recent studies have shown a likely methodology based systematic bias in the isotopic composition of xylem water extractions from woody plants e g allen kirchner 2022 chen et al 2020 landgraf et al 2021 we applied a deuterium correction to these data that was also used in some data analyses this was done simply for comparison with the raw data without any assumption about which was closer to the true isotopic composition for plant isotope samples we adapted the isotopic signature of the woody vegetation based on findings from chen et al 2020 by increasing the measured δ2h values by the mean value 8 1 following chen et al 2020 in goldsmith allen 2021 reported offsets to vary widely for european beech fagus sylvatica barbeta et al 2020 reported an offset of 11 0 and 3 0 for δ 2h and δ 18o and allen kirchner 2022 determined a mean offset from various studies of 6 1 3 4 so 8 1 was used as a reasonable first approximation of potential offset unfortunately there was insufficient data to apply species or site specific corrections as done for example in duvert et al 2021 to ensure comparability were corrected data is used the uncorrected results are provided in the supplemental material we also conducted a first approximation of the fraction of evaporated water f with the none steady model described in the isotopic mass balance in eq 1 gonfiantini 1986 hamilton et al 2005 in the upper soil 1 f 1 δ s δ δ p δ 1 m the non steady model assumes that no water is flowing in or out from in our case fractionated bulk soil water δ s and loss only occurs due to evaporative loss from the source pool δ p skrzypek et al 2015 fractionation is limited by the enrichment slope m eq s5 welhan fritz 1977 and isotopic enrichment factor δ eq s6 gat gonfiantini 1981 preliminary results showed that correction of soil water isotopes with linear regression to estimate the original unfractionated water source δ p cf sprenger et al 2017 can lead to negative evaporative fractions instead the original water source was estimated using the running weighted mean of precipitation for 15 day antecedent periods as the source pool δ p we chose 15 days as this followed the damped isotopic dynamics in the respective depths see below and partially accounts for mixing and storage in the soil the 15 days also roughly approximate the mean transit times mtt of the upper soil horizon see below the young water fraction ywf i e the proportion of soil water with ages of 2 3 months is a simple but useful method to compare differing water age dynamics between sites von freyberg et al 2018 and can be viewed as a metric of ecohydrological functioning we estimated ywf using the ratio between seasonal variation in precipitation and soil water kirchner 2016a 2016b only including precipitation from 2020 the ywf is the ratio between the amplitudes from sine wave fitted curves of soil and precipitation signals the ywf was estimated with an r script which contains iteratively reweighted least squares irls kirchner knapp 2020 version 1 4 as a further measure of water age dynamics and ecohydrological functioning the mtt of soil and plant waters were estimated with the convolutional integral method mcguire mcdonnell 2006 tetzlaff et al 2018 the gamma distribution fits a shape parameter α and scale parameter β to estimate the tracer breakthrough curve from rainfall inputs for the optimization we used the evolutionary algorithm solver microsoft excel 2016 16 0 4266 1001 64 bit from frontline solvers for the optimization of the mtt we used the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 as an objective function the kge takes the correlation mean bias and variability bias into account and shows optimal results with 1 knoben et al 2019 we averaged the best estimates for δ 2h and δ 18o to find the optimal parameters for the gamma distribution by maximizing the kge from both calculations we are aware that mtt calculations as well as ywf have limitations regarding being potentially biased by fractionation processes so we are using their results in a qualitative comparative sense finally to estimate the approximate sources of root water uptake rwu bayesian end member mixing analysis emma was applied with the mixsiar r package version 3 1 12 2020 10 20 the plant water isotope data both uncorrected and corrected were divided into potential soil water and groundwater sources for each sampling period stock semmens 2016 stock et al 2018 as tracers we implemented both stable isotopes to compare the potential source of plant water isotopes in the different sampled soil layers and deep soil groundwater using our groundwater samples each layer was treated separately and was not pooled leading to five potential sources each sampling date and location were calculated separately although mixsiar allowed specifying priors we used an uninformative prior e g the dirichlet distribution was set to 1 details about the model convergence can be found in the supplemental material in the table st1 to optimize the source contribution of soil water in xylem markov chain monte carlo utilized 1 000 000 runs with the first 500 000 burn in results discarded 4 results 4 1 dynamics in hydroclimate and soil moisture the study was undertaken in 2020 which followed the marked 2018 19 drought in berlin meaning that deeper soil water storage and groundwater levels were still below the long term average kuhlemann et al 2021a b the year was characterized by a mild winter and warm summer fig 2 a precipitation for the year totalled 471 mm which was 77 mm 14 lower than the long term average 1981 2010 the wettest periods occurred in february september and october which were the only months with precipitation above average the largest events occurred in summer and were convectional haacke paton 2021 april was the driest month with very little rain potential evaporation penman monteith fao 1998 was high 2 5 6 mm d throughout most of the main growing season april to september near surface soil moisture at all sites showed clear seasonality between the wetter winter and drier summer fig 2c there was a rapid decline in water content at all sites which started in mid march due to the low spring precipitation input and onset of increased potential evaporation fig 2a soil moisture variations in summer showed periods where top soils became almost completely dry but these were punctuated by rapid increases in swc in response to high intensity short term convectional rainfall events which drove re wetting july to august and september followed by rapid dry outs overall summer soil moisture content remained lower than in winter data from the station at sueo suggests that summer rewetting in berlin s soils was largely restricted to the upper soil layers but the site showed a generally good agreement in dynamics overall upper soils in the grasslands tended to have about 6 8 higher swc than those with tree cover in winter and 1 4 summer table 2 in terms of inter site differences site h was wetter by 14 swc than vp or tg with h g2 the wettest soils of the monitored sites median swc of 33 the sites h g2 and h t1 had the most marked response to rewetting in july vegetation influenced patterns in soil moisture were apparent in the more spatially extensive data across the secondary sites fig 3 this monitoring puts our core sites into a berlin wide context the median swc of tg g2 ranks in the driest 27 and vp g1 in the driest 36 of the investigated grassland sites in contrast h g1 was about 8 drier than the median swc of all sites while h g2 was wetter than 88 of all grassland sites with the highest swc of the forest site tg fs2 is in the lowest third in terms of wetness while h fs2 is in the upper 88 of all sites differences in vegetation cover and between sites on the water content of the upper soils were both significant median wilcoxon test p 0 05 however there were some exceptions for example the tree site with open bare soil had similar median swc to both forests and grasslands trees with grassland and street trees had significantly lower swc than trees with open soil and forests with shrubs and undercanopy p 0 05 but were similar p 0 8 to forests throughout the year the median coefficient of variation for swc for different sites 0 57 was similar to vegetation cover 0 61 implying local conditions e g soil radiation humidity effects of any irrigation etc are almost equally important to vegetation soils tended to be drier under patchier vegetation such as street trees or individual trees with grassland grasslands had the widest range of swc and the most marked dynamics we observed that some grassland sites had relatively high swcs which in a few cases resulted from irrigation and other factors e g poor subsurface drainage run on from impervious surfaces etc 4 2 soil water isotope dynamics precipitation isotopes displayed an expected seasonality with more depleted ratios i e more negative values in the winter months fig 2b in contrast summer precipitation was more enriched i e less negative though day to day variability could be large and intense summer events were often quite depleted variability in stable isotope inputs was damped in soil waters but followed the general direction of the seasonal precipitation cycle soil water isotopes from the sites were pooled into forest h fs2 tg fs2 grassland h g1 h g2 vp g1 tg g2 and tree h t1 sites andare summarized in table 3 soil water isotopes generally showed distinct fractionation signals due to evaporation generally plotting between the lmwl and lsel fig 4 a the mean slope of the lsel based on hydroclimatic data and precipitation isotopes was 3 08 being similar to gibson et al 2008 lsel δ 2 h 3 08 δ 18 o 26 13 the intersect between the lsel and lmwl was 47 1 and 6 8 for δ 2h and δ 18o respectively which was similar to the median precipitation isotopes of 47 5 and 6 9 respectively throughout the year the intersect was slightly higher in summer and lower in winter the lmwl with almost no change in the slope generally statistical differences between land cover types pairwise wilcoxon test for δ 2h could be found between the grassland and both forest and trees p 0 05 while the tree site and forest sites were not statistically different p value 0 1 from each other fractionation expressed as lc excess showed site to site statistical differences median p value 0 01 and the pooled data for the forest grassland and trees were similar p 0 05 this suggests that evaporative fractionation was more strongly influenced by site specific conditions rather than simple land cover controls the fractionation in soil isotopes was particularly marked in the grassland sites at vp g1 and tg g1 both were not significantly different lc excess p value 0 14 with contrasting land uses being more similar at h mean p value of lc excess 0 39 fig 4b h the most fractionated sites in vp and tg were close to the lsel with the lowest measured lc excess of 57 table 3 these grassland sites also had the highest recreational footfall were most exposed to the sun and had the greatest loss of grass cover over the summer the standard deviation sd in lc excess was also highest at the grassland sites vp g1 and tg g1 with 14 18 compared to 7 8 for forests at 0 5 cm table 3 probably due to high radiation leading to less uniform evaporation in the grasslands and more open tree cover sites in the top soil due to the high heterogeneity in soil characteristics in the near surface for all sites replicate soil water isotope samples became more similar with increasing depths for δ 2h δ 18o and lc excess expressed by a decreasing sd table 3 regression through the pooled soil samples for all sites showed differences between different vegetation cover more clearly the data for the grassland sites showed the lowest regression gradient of all fits table 4 in contrast the forest sites had the steepest regression slope closest to the lmwl with single trees without grass cover being intermediate table 4 during summer potential evaporation exceeded cumulative precipitation in most months fig 5 a leading to coincidence in the seasonality of precipitation inputs and evaporative fractionation enriching the isotopic composition of the soil water fig 5b d in the first set of samples in march soil water at all sites had isotope ratios with depleted signatures reflecting antecedent winter precipitation also at this time all sites showed little or no evidence of evaporative fractionation in their lc excess values the subsequent input of enriched summer rainfall from may along with the effects of the evaporative fraction were apparent in the heat maps fig 5 the propagation of enrichment from the upper soil layers to depth as the summer progressed is consistent with advective dispersive transport expected in soils as infiltrating rainfall mixes with and displaces soil water kirchner et al 2001 however the greater mixing with depth reduced variability in the isotope signature these propagation and transformation effects of the fractionation signals through the soil profile were particularly clear in the lc excess which was most marked for the grassland and tree sites with open soils following the summer soil water at most depths at all sites became more negative again following the depleted rain in late september and october 2020 fig 2b 4 3 dynamics in groundwater and plant water isotopes stable water isotopes in gw showed limited variation and no evaporative fractionation effects fig 4 gw was more negative than the intercept of the lsel gw h was relatively constant over the year with median values for δ 2h and δ 18o of 63 6 and 8 95 and sd values of 0 3 and 0 05 respectively in contrast gw bp indicated slightly stronger but still damped seasonality with median values for δ2h and δ 18o of 59 7 and 8 36 respectively and associated sds of 2 4 and 0 3 table 3 both gw wells were more negative than median precipitation implying that gw recharge was mostly occurring as a result of winter rainfall plant water extracted from both grass and trees generally had a similar isotopic range to soil water but was generally more fractionated fig 4b h table 3 the median lc excess for all xylem samples was 12 13 greater fractionation in plant water was also evident in the grass extracts which were similar to shallow soil water especially during drier periods in summer fig 4 c d g h almost all grass samples plotted similar to the lsel but some plotted below it all tree xylem samples at all sites plotted below the lmwl max lc excess 2 68 and were on average 0 7 and 10 lower than soil water samples for δ 2h δ 18o respectively some effects of fractionation were persistent independently of evaporative fractionation in the source water as no xylem sample plotted on the lmwl lc excess 0 plant water isotopes displayed less distinct seasonal variation compared to near surface soil isotopes during the summer months grass revealed generally greater variability median δ 2h 41 15 sd 14 2 than trees median δ 2h 56 3 sd 6 28 fig 4 grass water isotopes particular in tg g2 and vp g1 also showed a clear response to the depletion in precipitation isotopes between august and september fig 2b consistent with quick turnover times through root water uptake and transpiration tree samples showed enrichment in march and may as well as in november with a slight enrichment between july and august with a short rewetting phase in the upper soil large differences in the isotopic composition of xylem water from sampled individual trees were observed the norwegian maple tg fs2 and horse chestnut h t1 showed slight enrichment during summer 10 for δ 2h in august september compared to other trees all trees had higher isotope ratios at the start of sampling in march and at the end of sampling in november 40 to 50 for δ 2h and most depleted in summer 60 this contrasted with the seasonal precipitation input signal there is a suggestion that the depleted rainfall signal in autumn may be reflected in the norwegian maples tg fs2 where replicated plant xylem samples also showed low variability after the autumn re wetting the intra species comparison revealed that over the year the median values of xylem isotopes between trees were generally not significantly different from each other wilcoxon rank sum test p 0 05 the only exceptions were δ 2h values of the horse chestnut p 0 05 while grass samples were not significantly different between sites p 0 3 they were significant different to tree samples p 0 05 this gives a preliminary insight about potentially different water sources between trees and grass though the isotopic composition of water in grass stems seemed to be site independent 4 4 evaporative fraction as approximation of soil evaporation to gain a first approximation of soil evaporation within each sample we estimated the evaporative fraction based on the running means of the weighted precipitation inputs fig 6 open tree sites had similar evaporative fractions 20 of bulk soil water as grassland sites with poor vegetation cover tg g2 vp g1 and followed the lc excess seasonal cycle all sites had an evaporative fraction below 5 until june generally the evaporated fraction reached 10 20 for all sites except h g2 which had the lowest evaporated fraction of about 5 during the summer months for all sites the deeper soil 15 cm had low evaporative fractions and variability was more damped showing mixing with unfractionated water on percolation h fs2 and h g1 were very similar in seasonal dynamics and maxima of evaporated fraction with around 5 10 summer evaporation from soil were estimated the highest mean evaporative fractions with about 20 occurred in h t1 a site with open bare soil and 15 at both tg sites in july consistent with lc excess the highest evaporative fractions at the grassland sites were observed a month later in august it seems likely that the higher fractionation and evaporation from grassland sites were related to the poor grass cover and higher solar radiation exposure as well as thinner humidity boundary layer an exception was the wet h g2 site which was less used recreationally and retained a much denser grass cover however the lower the lc excess the higher was the deviation between evaporative fraction and lc excess which suggests an underestimation of evaporative fraction in high turnover sites in terms of rapid loss of water due to soil evaporation given that for vp g1 and tg g1 lc excess minima were 57 table 3 and swc was between 0 and 5 fig 2c the 20 30 evaporated fractions seemed to be rather low the evaporated fractions were also slightly negative whenever the lc excess was positive positive lc excess can be related directly to recent rainfall infiltrating into the soil 4 5 young water fractions fitting sine waves to estimate the ywf gave only a qualitative indication of the influence of young water in soil water turnover times as estimates were variously affected by fractionation fig 7 for δ18o the equivalent results for δ2h are shown in supplementary fig 1 although most fits were good in the deeper soil for the upper 5 cm ywf was usually 1 with some higher p values 0 05 indicating that the fits were not significant this was particularly the case for sites with high evaporative fractionation e g tg g2 and vp g1 mean lc excess in summer 30 despite this the effect of the seasonal variation in precipitation was clear and the shape of the fitted curves reflected the general dynamics of tracer transport through the soil profile being damped and lagged with depth compared to precipitation input consistent with advection dispersion for most sites there was a consistent decrease in the ywf with depth fig 7 the time lag between peaks from 0 to 5 to 25 35 cm was the shortest with 49 days for h g2 70 days for h fs2 ht 1 tg g2 and tg fs2 and 98 and 126 days for vp g1 and h g1 respectively the results are indicative of very rapid turnover of water in the upper profile within 35 cm of the soil profile and slowing with depth though the soil water remained dominated 50 by the ywf in comparison variation in groundwater was very damped indicating very limited new water influence 4 6 mean transit times of soil water and xylem water estimated mtts from a convolution integral model of soil water isotopic composition at different soil depths are also only meant as a first approximation due to the effects of fractionation in the upper soils fig 8 table 5 for most sites the kge as a measure for the model optimization was generally above 0 8 indicating quite good model fits most exceptions were for the 0 5 cm depths where kge was occasionally lower the kge generally improved with increasing depth as fractionation effects became less important and damping of the soil isotopic dynamic through mixing was more pronounced and reduced isotopic variation the lowest kge was indeed at the site with the highest isotopic fractionation 0 87 in δ 18o vp g1 this implies that apart from the uppermost soil layers the mtts can be considered as reasonable and more reliable with increasing soil depth the shape α and rate β parameters for each distribution are documented in table 5 α increased with depth at most sites reflecting the damping though this was not consistent resulting mtts varied from around one week in the upper soil 0 5 cm and increased to an average of about 17 weeks 4 months or a maximum of 22 weeks 5 months in 25 35 cm depth fig 8 there were no consistent differences between vegetation groups as these were confounded by the effects of evaporative factors the grassland site h g2 with the lowest lc excess and highest soil moisture content showed the shortest mtt in deeper soil and the longest mtt in the upper soil the age of plant water was also approximated by the convolution integral from precipitation inputs again the numbers are qualitative and only indicative but are consistent with a rapid turnover of shallow soil water for grass root water uptake where transpiration was estimated to have an age of a few days with much older water of 6 months in the trees these differences in transpiration ages are broadly consistent with those reported elsewhere sprenger et al 2019 though estimation of the mtt from plant water was highly uncertain as kge values were generally low table 4 the grass plant water mtt fits had some of the lowest kges while those for tree xylem were generally higher it was notable that trees with the poorest fits had enriched xylem water isotopes during spring and autumn 4 7 sources of root water uptake the wilcoxon paired test showed that the isotopic composition of the soil samples at each depth and location of all sites were significantly different p 0 05 accordingly they could be used in the end member mixing the approximate contributions of soil water from different depths to the plant water samples from each site are presented in fig 9 as these are derived from a bayesian endmember mixing analysis fig 10 shows the means from fig 9 in relation to their credible intervals from the monte carlo markov chain see for details in supplementary material table st1 for figs 9 and 10 we used the corrected data 8 1 δ 2h however the uncorrected data showed broadly similar results fig s2 for comparison absolute differences are shown in fig s3 table st1 summarizes also the convergence parameters generally the model converged relatively well though the mixing analysis for grass samples showed a poorer fit compared to trees for the grassland sites the dominance of the upper soil waters in explaining the plant water composition was striking with at least 50 of water contribution attributed to the upper 5 cm as indicated by the lc excess and the heatmaps fig 5 the deeper soils experienced relatively limited percolation during the study period particularly at vp g1 and tg g2 where around 75 90 of rwu was derived from the first 25 cm data from the grassland sites with higher swc at humboldthain suggested more seasonality in rwu and utilization of deeper soil water later in the summer which is consistent with the greater grass coverage resulting from a much more limited recreational footfall the uncertainty intervals fig 10 had wide ranges though even these suggest that deep soil water was an unlikely water source for vp g1 and tg g2 over the year deeper soil water below 15 cm or groundwater could account for 50 of plant water for most tree forest sites with in some cases a suggestion of seasonal variation at different depths fig 2b with decreasing water content in the upper soil observed at the core sites as the summer progressed the mixing model inferred a greater contribution of deep sources of rwu at most tree sites due to limited sample numbers these inferences are tentative and the relative importance of site and species factors are unclear however the modelling gave some preliminary evidence that different trees may vary sources of uptake in contrasting ways depending on water availability for example the horse chestnut at h t1 was estimated to have taken 25 less deep soil water at the beginning of august and then again in october november following wetter conditions figs 9 and 2c this change is greater than the bayesian uncertainty intervals fig 10 and may reflect the uptake from the wetter upper soils for almost all other tree species the rwu from 15 25 and 25 35 cm was rather constant over the year with about 10 and 40 respectively though with high uncertainties for apportioning the 25 35 cm and gw deep soil waters which both had less variable isotopic signatures fig 10 the european beech h fs2 and the hornbeam vp g1 are known as shallow rooting species kreutzer 1961 therefore the lower contribution from gw deep soil is unsurprising in contrast the european beech at vp g1 was inferred to have a greater gw deep soil water with higher mean values and lower uncertainty intervals possibly reflecting its age and deeper rooting patterns geoportal berlin gris 2021 5 discussion 5 1 1 spatial variations in urban soil moisture change in soil moisture storage is a key dynamic in the critical zone of urban areas that is poorly understood due to logistical challenges in monitoring both public and private urban green space the portable moisture probe used here in opportunistic sampling proved a flexible tool that yielded valuable insights into the swc of urban top soils at both the core monitoring locations and distributed range of secondary sites despite some heterogeneity in site characteristics the results showed a generally consistent pattern of grassland top soils being wetter than those under the cover of groups of trees or individual trees in urban parkland these spatially distributed results correspond to the plot scale observations of kuhlemann et al 2021 at the sueo at steglitz and associated modelling results by gillefalk et al 2021a b the differences in swc most likely reflect the interception losses from tree canopies in summer as well as generally higher transpiration from trees snelgrove et al 2020 conversely soil evaporation is higher in grasslands as indicated by the lc excess in the isotope data considering the urban heat island effect of about 1 5 2 c affecting berlin s green spaces vulova et al 2020 it can be speculated that soil evaporation in urban areas of berlin is higher than in surrounding areas also some smaller areas of urban green space may receive run on from surrounding impervious surfaces which may supplement soil moisture in meeting et demands gillefalk et al 2021a b however the added complexity caused by the potential effect of changes in grassland cover caused for example by heavy summer recreational activities makes direct comparisons difficult these insights into urban soil moisture dynamics demonstrate the utility of direct soil moisture monitoring campaigns that although logistically challenging are increasingly feasible in addition to the continuous monitoring at sueo in the past year berlin senate has established some core soil moisture monitoring sites across the city pflanzenschutzamt berlin 2020 it is easy to envisage how these sites of profile integrated monitoring could be complemented by opportunistic citizen science sampling campaigns to characterize the distributed patterns of changes in soil surface moisture content across extensive areas of the city fenner et al 2017 such data would help with the calibration of remote sensed products from satellite data which have exciting potential for understanding large scale changes in urban soils this could be also used in land surface models to give greater predictability of urban soil moisture conditions beck et al 2021 5 2 the value of soil water isotopes insights into evaporation subsurface flow paths and mixing collection of monthly bulk samples of soil water for isotope analysis complemented the near daily or weekly soil moisture measurements at the three core sites the isotope sampling still very limited in urban settings highlighted changes over a greater depth up to 35 cm than the soil moisture 5 cm and revealed further differences in patterns of soil water dynamics between sites and under contrasting vegetation covers these include differences in the infiltration of precipitation in evaporation via fractionation revealed by lc excess and redistribution by mixing and advection in the subsurface the monthly time resolution lack of winter data and effects of fractionation at some sites make the application of isotope based methods such as assessing the ywf and mtt uncertain kirchner 2016a b however they were still useful in providing preliminary insights into timescales of soil water dynamics in terms of water ages and thus are provisional metrics of ecohydrological functioning in general there was rapid water recycling in the upper soils at all sites with young water 2 months old dominating this was the case especially under grass but also under trees for the upper 15 cm intense summer rainstorms drove infiltration and soil moisture turnover as well as providing a water source for evaporation and rwu deeper soil water at 35 cm was older though still typically 4 5 months old indeed the isotope data showed limited percolation of rainfall inputs during the summer due to the high storage capacity of the upper soils and high atmospheric demand for green water fluxes again this is broadly consistent with the work of kuhlemann et al 2021 and gillefalk et al 2021a b at sueo where groundwater recharge from the soil was limited to winter the results are also in line with recent work in forest and grassland areas around berlin douinot et al 2019 kleine et al 2021 thus soil water isotopes can help understand the distribution of water in the urban critical zone and the relative hydrological partitioning into evaporative losses and groundwater recharge however there is a clear need for more isotope studies in a wider range of urban settings to better understand heterogeneities in the water balance and water age distributions 5 3 insights into sources of root water uptake from soil water and plant water isotopes even with limited sampling of isotopes in plant water at the core monitoring sites very useful preliminary insights into sources of water used by urban vegetation were gained in general the isotopic composition of plant water particularly in the grass was similar to soil water hirl et al 2019 plant water samples tended to be fractionated especially for trees though if corrected for potential method related offsets the data plotted close to the lmwl both visual inspections of the data and application of the mixing model showed that most 80 rwu in grasses could be attributed to the upper 15 cm of soils whilst for trees 50 of rwu was derived from deeper soil layers beyond this conclusions are tentative due to the limited sampling replication and potential methodological issues but there are suggestions that some trees at certain sites access deeper waters as soils become drier in the summer despite this both grass and trees showed evidence of rapid response to rainfall inputs for example for depleted rainfall in late summer these more qualitative insights are consistent with ecohydrological modelling studies in berlin by gillefalk et al 2021a b who showed that trees likely draw from both shallow younger and deeper older soil water sources to sustain larger transpiration fluxes whilst grasses mainly derive moisture from younger sources in the near surface however although our estimates of plant water sources and mtts seem to be in the right order of magnitude miguez macho fan 2021 sprenger et al 2019 they do not account for temporary storage internal mixing and physiological mechanisms in plants that can affect the composition of plant water especially in trees knighton et al 2020 smith et al 2022 and are therefore not well constrained the fact that for some tree sites such as the horse chestnuts with the poorest fits for mtts kge 0 21 0 45 had enriched plant water samples during spring and autumn is consistent with slower transpiration outside the growing season which may lead to fractionation within the trees oerter bowen 2019 thus whilst the simplifying assumptions of the mtt method may give an approximation for grass that is in the right order of magnitude the complex internal biophysical processes in trees together with long internal flow paths from the roots in the xylem likely resulted in highly uncertain estimates nevertheless some differences to other studies become apparent for example studies of tree xylem water across a range of sites in switzerland showed the dominant use of winter precipitation in sustaining rwu allen et al 2019 this possibly reflects differences in adaptation strategies by different species to climatic variations which result in variable soil moisture availability throughout the year and in some cases trees taking deeper water in drier conditions tetzlaff et al 2021 it has also been established that uptake from rooting networks especially from large trees integrate waters of varying ages from days to years which can also have internal travel times within the tree days to months before they are sampled in xylem seeger weiler 2021 smith et al 2022 in particular the winter storage of plant xylem water in non transpiring deciduous trees has been shown to fractionate over winter which may be why the first plant xylem water samples in spring are enriched in most of the trees sampled mccutcheon et al 2017 clearly our preliminary results merely scratch the surface of the complexity of water sources for urban trees but the further application of isotopes techniques in studies of plant water relations in urban settings have outstanding potential for elucidating key interactions that have management implications smith et al 2021 5 4 management implications rainfall can be partitioned into blue water such as groundwater recharge or runoff or green water fluxes including evaporation from soils or interception on vegetation surfaces as well as transpiration these new insights into water partitioning in urban green space is timely in the context of management implications cities are increasingly concerned with building resilience for climate change with higher temperatures and altered rainfall regimes changing the boundary conditions for urban design pyke et al 2011 in this context the role of urban green space in providing a areas for infiltration and water retention and b sources of water for et and urban cooling need to be thoroughly understood in different geographical locations where priorities for water management are likely to differ chang et al 2018 obviously enhancing et may reduce groundwater recharge in urban areas where it comprises an important component of water supplies increasing urban tree cover will likely increase green water fluxes though the impacts on blue water fluxes will depend upon factors such as species used planting densities location soil characteristics and management neill et al 2021 tree species previously successfully planted and grown may not be sustainable under climate change scenarios for example shallower rooting trees like beeches fabiani et al 2022 may be more drought susceptible than deeper rooting oaks thomas hartmann 1998 further there is some evidence that species composition can affect overall evapotranspiration rates with higher diversity increasing water losses van peer et al 2004 similarly although urban grasslands generally use less water they are more heavily used recreationally and at the monitoring sites here this resulted in a loss of grass cover over the summer with increased soil evaporation and potentially enhanced runoff from hydrophobic conditions hassane 2011 similar to our work other studies have shown the importance of near surface water sources in sustaining urban grasslands guderle et al 2018 consequently irrigation may need to become more extensive if water is available to subsidise near surface soil water to increase the resilience of existing vegetation to a warmer drier climate rather than the greater expense of using treated tap water or pumped groundwater one could use runoff from roofs or pre treated wastewater to mitigate periods of water stress and increase green water fluxes for berlin gillefalk et al 2021a b the addition of recycled water such as treated wastewater would maintain transpiration particular on grass but also enhance transpiration from trees reducing urban heat increasing groundwater recharge and thus enhancing the social economic value of the greenspace every city will have contrasting priorities and context specific challenges for building resilience to climate changes so it is crucial that an evidence base for understanding plant water interactions in urban green space is rapidly developed this can then help guide implement and assess new green infrastructure in future low impact developments in the management of urban water golden hoghooghi 2018 6 conclusions our unique data set of combined frequent manual monitoring of soil moisture and monthly sampling of bulk soil water stable isotopes over a longer period in an urban setting revealed contrasting patterns of water partitioning and re distribution in the upper critical zone of urban green spaces in a major city berlin in 2020 soils were wetter under grasslands than trees and showed greater effects of evaporative fractionation soils were characterised by rapid water turnover and were dominated by young water i e 2 months old though this influence decreased with depth during the summer little water percolated below the rooting zone with grass almost exclusively using near surface soil moisture to sustain transpirations whilst deeper rooting trees were less dependent on shallow water sources though this varied between species the opportunistic sampling of larger scale surface soil moisture measurement used here provided some preliminary but still highly novel insights into shallow subsurface non hortonian flow paths in urban green spaces however much more detailed information is needed in a wider range of geographical settings to be incorporated into models and quantify variations in the water balance and ecohydrological response times in wet and dry periods of differing longevity such data model fusion is required for an evidence base to manage

3160,we used stable isotopes to help assess ecohydrological partitioning in different types of urban green space in the city of berlin we focused particularly on the role of the near surface of soils as a crucial interface that determines shallow subsurface non hortonian flows and water cycling in cities grassland soils tended to be wetter than soils under continuous urban tree cover and areas around individual trees in parks or on streets this is consistent with greater interception losses and transpiration from trees soil water isotopes showed distinct seasonality in response to precipitation inputs mixing with resident soil water and the effects of evaporative fractionation effects of fractionation were most marked under individual trees and grasslands where the effects of evaporation on the isotopic composition of percolating water from the upper 0 1 m of the soil was also most pronounced isotope dynamics showed that under all land covers the upper soils had rapid water turnover and were dominated by younger water 2 months old at depths of 0 4 m more damping was evident with water being 6 months old isotopes in plant water also show seasonal variations which were more marked in grasses than trees mixing models revealed that grass most likely recycled shallow younger soil water in transpiration whilst trees were more dependent on deeper older sub soil and groundwater sources these preliminary results highlight the urgent need for a much greater understanding of water movement and cycling in the shallow critical zone of urban green spaces this is

nielsen et al 2014 greater amenity chen wang 2013 and improved physical and mental health for citizens who 2016 braubach et al 2017 a crucial role of urban green space is its influence on water cycling and the ecohydrological partitioning of rainfall higher rainfall infiltration enhances the retention of water in urban areas both reducing local flood risk le et al 2019 fiori volpi 2020 and increasing soil moisture storage and groundwater recharge dietz 2007 kuhlemann et al 2021a b as a result of this the concept of green infrastructure where green spaces are protected and enhanced for greater water retention to mitigate floods and water scarcity in conurbations is gaining popularity he et al 2021 urban green space also enhances evapotranspiration that can help mitigate the urban heat island effect through cooling from latent heat fluxes at the local gago et al 2013 to city scale oke 1989 consequently the management design and creation of urban green space is a critical component of any urban planning seeking to build resilience to climate change in towns and cities and balance potentially competing water demands it follows that there is an important need to quantify the spatial and temporal variability of ecohydrological partitioning in urban green spaces in large towns and cities this need for a water sensitive urban design generates urgent research challenges in urban hydrology this necessitates moving on from focussing on stormwater management resulting from hortonian overland flow from low permeability surfaces to incorporating a more process based understanding of how water moves through the highly heterogeneous and poorly understood subsurface of urban areas bonneau et al 2018 indeed there is a need to integrate more urban sites into critical

around 50 secondary sites fig 1b for soil moisture measurements were located in plots of different sizes and land use in the centre of berlin mitte and berlin pankow north some of these soil moisture sites are partially irrigated and some others have a particular urban character like individual street trees we also had access to data from the steglitz urban ecohydrologic observatory sueo fig 1a a

undertaken in 2020 we considered spring as march to may summer from june to august and september to november as autumn with the main growing season in spring and summer climatic data including precipitation mean daily vapour pressure deficit relative humidity and wind speed were obtained from the dwd deutscher wetter dienst german weather service station at berlin tegel close to the study

our core site h encompassing thirteen plots and weekly at eighteen parks including our other two core sites vp and tg encompassing 37 plot sites unfortunately equipment failures and delayed repairs due to the covid pandemic resulted in two major data gaps between june to july 2020 and september to mid october 2020 though the seasonal dynamics as well as short term variability were sufficiently well captured at the reference site at sueo swc was recorded in duplicates at three depths 10 15 40 50 and 90 100 cm in an hourly resolution details in kuhlemann et al 2021a b 3 3 soil water isotopes soil water isotopes were analyzed in vapour extracted from soil samples collected at our three core sites monthly between march and november 2020 each site consisted of two locations 10 m distance with each of these comprising two profiles extracted in close proximity to each other 10 cm we sub sampled at four depths 0 5 5 15 15 25 25 35 cm giving four replicates of each depth from which the two samples in close proximity were combined and analysed in one bag we used a sampling ring for depth until 5 cm below 5 cm we used a soil auger diameter of 4 cm the sampled soil was quickly stored in metalized bags cb400 420siz weber packaging gmbh güglingen germany and zip locked air tight sample collection was not possible in april 2020 due to fieldwork restrictions under the covid 19 lockdown isotope ratios were measured in the laboratory using the direct vapour equilibrium dve method wassenaar et al 2008 soil samples were allowed to equilibrate for 48 h before vapour extraction and analysis all samples contained 2 3 ml of residual water hendry et al 2015 gralher et al 2021 four blocks of three different standards vsmow referred for the dve were set up and were measured with the samples at the beginning the end and during the first and second third of the bags the vapour in each bag was measured for 8 10 min to ensure a stable plateau sdh2oppm 100 for plateau identification gradient and quantile filters were used to create a reliable mean the standards were used for drift control over the measurement and the year and to convert from the vapour phase back into the liquid phase 3 4 plant water isotopes monthly samples for plant water extraction were collected on the same day as soil samples grass samples were taken by clipping grass turf directly above the soil sample location for grass we sampled the hypocotyl the part of the grass between blade and root to minimise the effects of any leaf water which might have been partially transpired twigs from trees table 1 were sampled with telescopic pruning shears samples were frozen on return to the laboratory cryogenic vacuum extraction using the setup and protocol described in koeniger et al 2016 was then used to derive water samples an extraction time of 90 min west et al 2006 was used with an extraction efficiency of 95 99 before the extraction an empty vial is frozen with liquid nitrogen and evacuated by a vacuum pump next the sample is frozen and connected to the evacuated vial via a stainless steel capillary tube koeniger et al 2011 afterwards to extract the water the sample vial was placed in a 105 c heated custom built isolated aluminium block gaj et al 2016 after extraction the xylem water samples were measured using crds l 2130i picarro inc santa clara ca usa precision 0

screened at 4 5 6 5 m b g l with an average groundwater depth of 3 3 m b g l along with the liquid samples from precipitation and xylem water groundwater samples were analyzed using a crds analyzer and referenced to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow standard 3 6 data analysis processing of isotope analysis data and the majority of other data analyses were conducted using r script r version 4 0 4 2021 02 15 r core team 2021 we used wilcoxon signed rank tests to evaluate if groups were statistically different p 0 05 wilcoxon 1945 to quantify variations of dynamics of pooled groups the coefficient of variation between both was calculated which is a unitless normalization of the standard deviation by the mean maity 2022 line conditioned excess lc excess was calculated to show the deviation of isotope samples from the local meteoric water line lmwl due to evaporative fractionation landwehr and coplen 2006 the lmwl was derived from long term data at steglitz kuhlemann et al

equilibrium in the atmosphere details of the estimation were also reported in the supplemental material eq s2 s4 because recent studies have shown a likely methodology based systematic bias in the isotopic composition of xylem water extractions from woody plants e g allen kirchner 2022 chen et al 2020 landgraf et al 2021 we applied a deuterium correction to these data that was also used in some data analyses this was done simply for comparison with the raw data without any assumption about which was closer to the true isotopic composition for plant isotope samples we adapted the isotopic signature of the woody vegetation based on findings from chen et al 2020 by increasing the measured δ2h values by the mean value 8 1 following chen et al 2020 in goldsmith allen 2021 reported offsets to vary widely for european beech fagus sylvatica barbeta et al 2020 reported an offset of 11 0 and 3 0 for δ 2h and δ 18o and allen kirchner 2022 determined a mean offset from various studies of 6 1 3 4 so 8 1 was used as a reasonable first approximation of potential offset unfortunately there was insufficient data to apply species or site specific corrections as done for example in duvert et al 2021 to ensure comparability were corrected data is used the uncorrected results are provided in the supplemental material we also conducted a first approximation of the fraction of evaporated water f

slope m eq s5 welhan fritz 1977 and isotopic enrichment factor δ eq s6 gat gonfiantini 1981 preliminary results showed that correction of soil water isotopes with linear regression to estimate the original unfractionated water source δ p cf sprenger et al 2017 can lead to negative evaporative fractions instead the original water source was estimated using the running weighted mean of precipitation for 15 day antecedent periods as the source pool δ p we chose 15 days as this followed the damped isotopic dynamics in the respective depths see below and partially accounts for mixing and storage in the soil the 15 days also roughly approximate the mean transit times mtt of the upper soil horizon see below the young water fraction ywf i e the proportion of soil water with ages of 2 3 months is a simple but useful method to compare differing water age dynamics between sites von freyberg et al 2018 and can be viewed as a metric of ecohydrological functioning we estimated ywf using the ratio between seasonal variation in precipitation and soil water kirchner 2016a 2016b only including precipitation from 2020 the ywf is the ratio between the amplitudes from sine wave fitted curves of soil and precipitation signals the ywf was estimated with an r script which contains iteratively reweighted least squares irls kirchner knapp 2020 version 1 4 as a further measure of water age dynamics and ecohydrological functioning the mtt of soil and plant waters were estimated with the convolutional integral method mcguire mcdonnell 2006 tetzlaff et al 2018 the gamma distribution fits a shape parameter α and scale parameter β to estimate the tracer breakthrough curve from rainfall inputs for the optimization we used the evolutionary algorithm solver microsoft excel 2016 16 0 4266 1001 64 bit from frontline solvers for the optimization of the mtt we used the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 as an objective function the kge takes the correlation mean bias and variability bias into account and shows optimal results with 1 knoben et al 2019 we averaged the best estimates for δ 2h and δ 18o to find the optimal parameters for the gamma distribution by maximizing the kge from both calculations we are aware that mtt calculations as well as ywf have limitations regarding being potentially biased by fractionation processes so we are using their results in a qualitative comparative sense finally to estimate the approximate sources of root water uptake rwu bayesian end member mixing analysis emma was applied with the mixsiar r package version 3 1 12 2020 10 20 the plant water isotope data both uncorrected and corrected were divided into potential soil water and groundwater sources for each sampling period stock semmens 2016 stock et al 2018 as tracers we implemented both stable isotopes to compare the potential source of plant water isotopes in the different sampled soil layers and deep soil groundwater using our groundwater samples each layer was treated separately and was not pooled leading to five potential sources each sampling date and location were calculated separately although mixsiar allowed specifying priors we used an uninformative prior e g the dirichlet distribution was set to 1 details about the model convergence can be found in the supplemental material in the table st1 to optimize the source contribution of

in 2020 which followed the marked 2018 19 drought in berlin meaning that deeper soil water storage and groundwater levels were still below the long term average kuhlemann et al 2021a b the year was characterized by a mild winter and warm summer fig 2 a precipitation for the year totalled 471 mm which was 77 mm 14 lower than the long term average 1981 2010 the wettest periods occurred in february september and october which were the only months with precipitation above average the largest events occurred in summer and were convectional haacke paton 2021 april was the driest month with very little rain potential evaporation penman monteith fao 1998 was high 2 5 6 mm d throughout most of the main growing season april to september near surface soil moisture at all sites showed clear seasonality between the wetter winter and drier summer fig 2c there was a rapid decline in water content at all sites which started in mid march due to the low spring precipitation input and onset of increased potential evaporation fig 2a soil moisture variations in summer showed periods where top soils became almost completely dry but these were punctuated by rapid increases in swc in response to high intensity short term convectional rainfall events which drove re wetting july to august and september followed by rapid dry outs overall summer soil moisture content remained lower than in winter data from the station at sueo suggests that summer rewetting in berlin s soils was largely restricted to the upper soil layers but the site showed a generally good agreement in dynamics overall upper soils in the grasslands tended to have about 6 8 higher swc than those with tree cover in winter and 1 4 summer table 2 in terms of inter site differences site h was wetter by 14 swc than vp or tg with h g2 the wettest soils of the monitored sites median swc of 33 the sites h g2 and h t1 had the most marked response to rewetting in july vegetation influenced patterns in soil moisture were apparent in the more spatially extensive data across the secondary sites fig 3 this monitoring puts our core sites into a berlin wide context the median swc of tg g2 ranks in the driest 27 and vp g1 in the driest 36 of the investigated grassland sites in contrast h g1 was about 8 drier than the median swc of all sites while h g2 was wetter than 88 of all grassland sites with the highest swc of the forest site tg fs2 is in the lowest third in terms of wetness while h fs2 is in the upper 88 of all sites differences in vegetation cover and between sites on the water content of the upper soils were both significant median wilcoxon test p 0 05 however there were some exceptions for example the tree site with open bare soil had similar median swc to both forests and grasslands trees with grassland and street trees had significantly lower swc than trees with open soil and forests with shrubs and undercanopy p 0 05 but were similar p 0 8 to forests throughout the year the median coefficient of variation for swc for different sites 0 57 was similar to vegetation cover 0 61 implying local conditions e g soil radiation humidity effects of any irrigation etc are almost equally important to vegetation soils tended to be drier under patchier vegetation such as street trees or individual trees with grassland grasslands had the widest range of swc and the most marked dynamics we observed that some grassland sites had relatively high swcs which in a few cases resulted from irrigation and other factors e g poor subsurface drainage run on from impervious surfaces etc 4 2 soil water isotope dynamics precipitation isotopes displayed an expected seasonality with more depleted ratios i e more negative values in the winter months fig 2b in contrast summer precipitation was more enriched i e less negative though day to day variability could be large and intense summer events were often quite depleted variability in stable isotope inputs was damped in soil waters but followed the general direction of the seasonal precipitation cycle soil water isotopes from the sites were pooled into forest h fs2 tg fs2 grassland h g1 h g2 vp g1 tg g2 and tree h t1 sites andare summarized in table 3 soil water isotopes generally showed distinct fractionation signals due to evaporation generally plotting between the lmwl and lsel fig 4 a the mean slope of the lsel based on hydroclimatic data and precipitation isotopes was 3 08 being similar to gibson et al 2008 lsel δ 2 h 3 08 δ 18 o 26 13 the intersect between the lsel and lmwl was 47 1 and 6 8 for δ 2h and δ 18o respectively which was similar to the median precipitation isotopes of 47 5 and 6 9 respectively throughout the year the intersect was slightly higher in summer and lower in winter the lmwl with almost no change in the slope generally statistical differences between land cover types pairwise wilcoxon test for δ 2h could be found between the grassland and both forest and trees p 0 05 while the tree site and forest sites were not statistically different p value 0 1 from each other fractionation expressed as lc excess showed site to site statistical differences median p value 0 01 and the pooled data for the forest grassland and trees were similar p 0 05 this suggests that evaporative fractionation was more strongly influenced by site specific conditions rather than simple land cover controls the fractionation in soil isotopes was particularly marked in the grassland sites at vp g1 and tg g1 both were not significantly different lc excess p value 0 14 with contrasting land uses being more similar at h mean p value of lc excess 0 39 fig 4b h the most fractionated sites in vp and tg were close to the lsel with the lowest measured lc excess of 57 table 3 these grassland sites also had the highest recreational footfall were most exposed to the sun and had the greatest loss of grass cover over the summer the standard deviation sd in lc excess was also highest at the grassland sites vp g1 and tg g1 with 14 18 compared to 7 8 for forests at 0 5 cm table 3 probably due to high radiation leading to less uniform evaporation in the grasslands and more open tree cover sites in the top soil due to the high heterogeneity in soil characteristics in the near surface for all sites replicate soil water isotope samples became more similar with increasing depths for δ 2h δ 18o and lc excess expressed by a decreasing sd table 3 regression through the pooled soil samples for all sites showed differences between different vegetation cover more clearly the data for the grassland sites showed the lowest regression gradient of all fits table 4 in contrast the forest sites had the steepest regression slope closest to the lmwl with single trees without grass cover being intermediate table 4 during summer potential evaporation exceeded cumulative precipitation in most months fig 5 a leading to coincidence in the seasonality of precipitation inputs and evaporative fractionation enriching the isotopic composition of the soil water fig 5b d in the first set of samples in march soil water at all sites had isotope ratios with depleted signatures reflecting antecedent winter precipitation also at this time all sites showed little or no evidence of evaporative fractionation in their lc excess values the subsequent input of enriched summer rainfall from may along with the effects of the evaporative fraction were apparent in the heat maps fig 5 the propagation of enrichment from the upper soil layers to depth as the summer progressed is consistent with advective dispersive transport expected in soils as infiltrating rainfall mixes with and displaces soil water kirchner et al 2001 however the greater mixing with depth reduced variability in the isotope signature these propagation and transformation effects of the fractionation signals through the soil profile were particularly clear in the lc excess which was most marked for the grassland and tree sites with open soils following the summer soil water at most depths at all sites became more negative again following the depleted rain in late september and october 2020 fig 2b 4 3 dynamics in groundwater and plant water isotopes stable water isotopes in gw showed limited variation and no evaporative fractionation effects fig 4 gw was more negative than the intercept of the lsel gw h was relatively constant over the year with median values for δ 2h and δ 18o of 63 6 and 8 95 and sd values of 0 3 and 0 05 respectively in contrast gw bp indicated slightly stronger but still damped seasonality with median values for δ2h and δ 18o of 59 7 and 8 36 respectively and associated sds of 2 4 and 0 3 table 3 both gw wells were more negative than median precipitation implying that gw recharge was mostly occurring as a result of winter rainfall plant water extracted from both grass and trees generally had a similar isotopic range to soil water but was generally more fractionated fig 4b h table 3 the median lc excess for all xylem samples was 12 13 greater fractionation in plant water was also evident in the grass extracts which were similar to shallow soil water especially during drier periods in summer fig 4 c d g h almost all grass samples plotted similar to the lsel but some plotted below it all tree xylem samples at all sites plotted below the lmwl max lc excess 2 68 and were on average 0 7 and 10 lower than soil water samples for δ 2h δ 18o respectively some effects of fractionation were persistent independently of evaporative fractionation in the source water as no xylem sample plotted on the lmwl lc excess 0 plant water isotopes displayed less distinct seasonal variation compared to near surface soil isotopes during the summer months grass revealed generally greater variability median δ 2h 41 15 sd 14 2 than trees median δ 2h 56 3 sd 6 28 fig 4 grass water isotopes particular in tg g2 and vp g1 also showed a clear response to the depletion in precipitation isotopes between august and september fig 2b consistent with quick turnover times through root water uptake and transpiration tree samples showed enrichment in march and may as well as in november with a slight enrichment between july and august with a short rewetting phase in the upper soil large differences in the isotopic composition of xylem water from sampled individual trees were observed the norwegian maple tg fs2 and horse chestnut h t1 showed slight enrichment during summer 10 for δ 2h in august september compared to other trees all trees had higher isotope ratios at the start of sampling in march and at the end of sampling in november 40 to 50 for δ 2h and most depleted in summer 60 this contrasted with the seasonal precipitation input signal there is a suggestion that the depleted rainfall signal in autumn may be reflected in the norwegian maples tg fs2 where replicated plant xylem samples also showed low variability after the autumn re wetting the intra species comparison revealed that over the year the median values of xylem isotopes between trees were generally not significantly different from each other wilcoxon rank sum test p 0 05 the only exceptions were δ 2h values of the horse chestnut p 0 05 while grass samples were not significantly different between sites p 0 3 they were significant different to tree samples p 0 05 this gives a preliminary insight about potentially different water sources between trees and grass though the isotopic composition of water in grass stems seemed to be site independent 4 4 evaporative fraction as approximation of soil evaporation to gain a first approximation of soil evaporation within each sample we estimated the evaporative fraction based on the running means of the weighted precipitation inputs fig 6 open tree sites had similar evaporative fractions 20 of bulk soil water as grassland sites with poor vegetation cover tg g2 vp g1 and followed the lc excess seasonal cycle all sites had an evaporative fraction below 5 until june generally the evaporated fraction reached 10 20 for all sites except h g2 which had the lowest evaporated fraction of about 5 during the summer months for all sites the deeper soil 15 cm had low evaporative fractions and variability was more damped showing mixing with unfractionated water on percolation h fs2 and h g1 were very similar in seasonal dynamics and maxima of evaporated fraction with around 5 10 summer evaporation from soil were estimated the highest mean evaporative fractions with about 20 occurred in h t1 a site with open bare soil and 15 at both tg sites in july consistent with lc excess the highest evaporative fractions at the grassland sites were observed a month later in august it seems likely that the higher fractionation and evaporation from grassland sites were related to the poor grass cover and higher solar radiation exposure as well as thinner humidity boundary layer an exception was the wet h g2 site which was less used recreationally and retained a much denser grass cover however the lower the lc excess the higher was the deviation between evaporative fraction and lc excess which suggests an underestimation of evaporative fraction in high turnover sites in terms of rapid loss of water due to soil evaporation given that for vp g1 and tg g1 lc excess minima were 57 table 3 and swc was between 0 and 5 fig 2c the 20 30 evaporated fractions seemed to be rather low the evaporated fractions were also slightly negative whenever the lc excess was positive positive lc excess can be related directly to recent rainfall infiltrating into the soil 4 5 young water fractions fitting sine waves to estimate the ywf gave only a qualitative indication of the influence of young water in soil water turnover times as estimates were variously affected by fractionation fig 7 for δ18o the equivalent results for δ2h are shown in supplementary fig 1 although most fits were good in the deeper soil for the upper 5 cm ywf was usually 1 with some higher p values 0 05 indicating that the fits were not significant this was particularly the case for sites with high evaporative fractionation e g tg g2 and vp g1 mean lc excess in summer 30 despite this the effect of the seasonal variation in precipitation was clear and the shape of the fitted curves reflected the general dynamics of tracer transport through the soil profile being damped and lagged with depth compared to precipitation input consistent with advection dispersion for most sites there was a consistent decrease in the ywf with depth fig 7 the time lag between peaks from 0 to 5 to 25 35 cm was the shortest with 49 days for h g2 70 days for h fs2 ht 1 tg g2 and tg fs2 and 98 and 126 days for vp g1 and h g1 respectively the results are indicative of very rapid turnover of water in the upper profile within 35 cm of the soil profile and slowing with depth though the soil water remained dominated 50 by the ywf in comparison variation in groundwater was very damped indicating very limited new water influence 4 6 mean transit times of soil water and xylem water estimated mtts from a convolution integral model of soil water isotopic composition at different soil depths are also only meant as a first approximation due to the effects of fractionation in the upper soils fig 8 table 5 for most sites the kge as a measure for the model optimization was generally above 0 8 indicating quite good model fits most exceptions were for the 0 5 cm depths where kge was occasionally lower the kge generally improved with increasing depth as fractionation effects became less important and damping of the soil isotopic dynamic through mixing was more pronounced and reduced isotopic variation the lowest kge was indeed at the site with the highest isotopic fractionation 0 87 in δ 18o vp g1 this implies that apart from the uppermost soil layers the mtts can be considered as reasonable and more reliable with increasing soil depth the shape α and rate β parameters for each distribution are documented in table 5 α increased with depth at most sites reflecting the damping though this was not consistent resulting mtts varied from around one week in the upper soil 0 5 cm and increased to an average of about 17 weeks 4 months or a maximum of 22 weeks 5 months in 25 35 cm depth fig 8 there were no consistent differences between vegetation groups as these were confounded by the effects of evaporative factors the grassland site h g2 with the lowest lc excess and highest soil moisture content showed the shortest mtt in deeper soil and the longest mtt in the upper soil the age of plant water was also approximated by the convolution integral from precipitation inputs again the numbers are qualitative and only indicative but are consistent with a rapid turnover of shallow soil water for grass root water uptake where transpiration was estimated to have an age of a few days with much older water of 6 months in the trees these differences in transpiration ages are broadly consistent with those reported elsewhere sprenger et al 2019 though estimation of the mtt from plant water was highly uncertain as kge values were generally low table 4 the grass plant water mtt fits had some of the lowest kges while those for tree xylem were generally higher it was notable that trees with the poorest fits had enriched xylem water isotopes during spring and autumn 4 7 sources of root water uptake the wilcoxon paired test showed that the isotopic composition of the soil samples at each depth and location of all sites were significantly different p 0 05 accordingly they could be used in the end member mixing the approximate contributions of soil water from different depths to the plant water samples from each site are presented in fig 9 as these are derived from a bayesian endmember mixing analysis fig 10 shows the means from fig 9 in relation to their credible intervals from the monte carlo markov chain see for details in supplementary material table st1 for figs 9 and 10 we used the corrected data 8 1 δ 2h however the uncorrected data showed broadly similar results fig s2 for comparison absolute differences are shown in fig s3 table st1 summarizes also the convergence parameters generally the model converged relatively well though the mixing analysis for grass samples showed a poorer fit compared to trees for the grassland sites the dominance of the upper soil waters in explaining the plant water composition was striking with at least 50 of water contribution attributed to the upper 5 cm as indicated by the lc excess and the heatmaps fig 5 the deeper soils experienced relatively limited percolation during the study period particularly at vp g1 and tg g2 where around 75 90 of rwu was derived from the first 25 cm data from the grassland sites with higher swc at humboldthain suggested more seasonality in rwu and utilization of deeper soil water later in the summer which is consistent with the greater grass coverage resulting from a much more limited recreational footfall the uncertainty intervals fig 10 had wide ranges though even these suggest that deep soil water was an unlikely water source for vp g1 and tg g2 over the year deeper soil water below 15 cm or groundwater could account for 50 of plant water for most tree forest sites with in some cases a suggestion of seasonal variation at different depths fig 2b with decreasing water content in the upper soil observed at the core sites as the summer progressed the mixing model inferred a greater contribution of deep sources of rwu at most tree sites due to limited sample numbers these inferences are tentative and the relative importance of site and species factors are unclear however the modelling gave some preliminary evidence that different trees may vary sources of uptake in contrasting ways depending on water availability for example the horse chestnut at h t1 was estimated to have taken 25 less deep soil water at the beginning of august and then again in october november following wetter conditions figs 9 and 2c this change is greater than the bayesian uncertainty intervals fig 10 and may reflect the uptake from the wetter upper soils for almost all other tree species the rwu from 15 25 and 25 35 cm was rather constant over the year with about 10 and 40 respectively though with high uncertainties for apportioning the 25 35 cm and gw deep soil waters which both had less variable isotopic signatures fig 10 the european beech h fs2 and the hornbeam vp g1 are known as shallow rooting species kreutzer 1961 therefore the lower contribution from gw deep soil is unsurprising in contrast the european beech at vp g1 was inferred to have a greater gw deep soil water with higher mean values and lower uncertainty intervals possibly reflecting its age and deeper rooting patterns geoportal berlin gris 2021 5 discussion 5 1 1 spatial variations in urban soil moisture change in soil moisture storage is a key dynamic in the critical zone of urban areas that is poorly understood due to logistical challenges in monitoring both public and private urban green space the portable moisture probe used here in opportunistic sampling proved a flexible tool that yielded valuable insights into the swc of urban top soils at both the core monitoring locations and distributed range of secondary sites despite some heterogeneity in site characteristics the results showed a generally consistent pattern of grassland top soils being wetter than those under the cover of groups of trees or individual trees in urban parkland these spatially distributed results correspond to the plot scale observations of kuhlemann et al 2021 at the sueo at steglitz and associated modelling results by gillefalk et al 2021a b the differences in swc most likely reflect the interception losses from tree canopies in summer as well as generally higher transpiration from trees snelgrove et al 2020 conversely soil evaporation is higher in grasslands as indicated by the lc excess in the isotope data considering the urban heat island effect of about 1 5 2 c affecting berlin s green spaces vulova et al 2020 it can be speculated that soil evaporation in urban areas of berlin is higher than in surrounding areas also some smaller areas of urban green space may receive run on from surrounding impervious surfaces which may supplement soil moisture in meeting et demands gillefalk et al 2021a b however the added complexity caused by the potential effect of changes in grassland cover caused for example by heavy summer recreational activities makes direct comparisons difficult these insights into urban soil moisture dynamics demonstrate the utility of direct soil moisture monitoring campaigns that although logistically challenging are increasingly feasible in addition to the continuous monitoring at sueo in the past year berlin senate has established some core soil moisture monitoring sites across the city pflanzenschutzamt berlin 2020 it is easy to envisage how these sites of profile integrated monitoring could be complemented by opportunistic citizen science sampling campaigns to characterize the distributed patterns of changes in soil surface moisture content across extensive areas of the city fenner et al 2017 such data would help with the calibration of remote sensed products from satellite data which have exciting potential for understanding large scale changes in urban soils this could be also used in land surface models to give greater predictability of urban soil moisture conditions beck et al 2021 5 2 the value of soil water isotopes insights into evaporation subsurface flow paths and mixing collection of monthly bulk samples of soil water for isotope analysis complemented the near daily or weekly soil moisture measurements at the three core sites the isotope sampling still very limited in urban settings highlighted changes over a greater depth up to 35 cm than the soil moisture 5 cm and revealed further differences in patterns of soil water dynamics between sites and under contrasting vegetation covers these include differences in the infiltration of precipitation in evaporation via fractionation revealed by lc excess and redistribution by mixing and advection in the subsurface the monthly time resolution lack of winter data and effects of fractionation at some sites make the application of isotope based methods such as assessing the ywf and mtt uncertain kirchner 2016a b however they were still useful in providing preliminary insights into timescales of soil water dynamics in terms of water ages and thus are provisional metrics of ecohydrological functioning in general there was rapid water recycling in the upper soils at all sites with young water 2 months old dominating this was the case especially under grass but also under trees for the upper 15 cm intense summer rainstorms drove infiltration and soil moisture turnover as well as providing a water source for evaporation and rwu deeper soil water at 35 cm was older though still typically 4 5 months old indeed the isotope data showed limited percolation of rainfall inputs during the summer due to the high storage capacity of the upper soils and high atmospheric demand for green water fluxes again this is broadly consistent with the work of kuhlemann et al 2021 and gillefalk et al 2021a b at sueo where groundwater recharge from the soil was limited to winter the results are also in line with recent work in forest and grassland areas around berlin douinot et al 2019 kleine et al 2021 thus soil water isotopes can help understand the distribution of water in the urban critical zone and the relative hydrological partitioning into evaporative losses and groundwater recharge however there is a clear need for more isotope studies in a wider range of urban settings to better understand heterogeneities in the water balance and water age distributions 5 3 insights into sources of root water uptake from soil water and plant water isotopes even with limited sampling of isotopes in plant water at the core monitoring sites very useful preliminary insights into sources of water used by urban vegetation were gained in general the isotopic composition of plant water particularly in the grass was similar to soil water hirl et al 2019 plant water samples tended to be fractionated especially for trees though if corrected for potential method related offsets the data plotted close to the lmwl both visual inspections of the data and application of the mixing model showed that most 80 rwu in grasses could be attributed to the upper 15 cm of soils whilst for trees 50 of rwu was derived from deeper soil layers beyond this conclusions are tentative due to the limited sampling replication and potential methodological issues but there are suggestions that some trees at certain sites access deeper waters as soils become drier in the summer despite this both grass and trees showed evidence of rapid response to rainfall inputs for example for depleted rainfall in late summer these more qualitative insights are consistent with ecohydrological modelling studies in berlin by gillefalk et al 2021a b who showed that trees likely draw from both shallow younger and deeper older soil water sources to sustain larger transpiration fluxes whilst grasses mainly derive moisture from younger sources in the near surface however although our estimates of plant water sources and mtts seem to be in the right order of magnitude miguez macho fan 2021 sprenger et al 2019 they do not account for temporary storage internal mixing and physiological mechanisms in plants that can affect the composition of plant water especially in trees knighton et al 2020 smith et al 2022 and are therefore not well constrained the fact that for some tree sites such as the horse chestnuts with the poorest fits for mtts kge 0 21 0 45 had enriched plant water samples during spring and autumn is consistent with slower transpiration outside the growing season which may lead to fractionation within the trees oerter bowen 2019 thus whilst the simplifying assumptions of the mtt method may give an approximation for grass that is in the right order of magnitude the complex internal biophysical processes in trees together with long internal flow paths from the roots in the xylem likely resulted in highly uncertain estimates nevertheless some differences to other studies become apparent for example studies of tree xylem water across a range of sites in switzerland showed the dominant use of winter precipitation in sustaining rwu allen et al 2019 this possibly reflects differences in adaptation strategies by different species to climatic variations which result in variable soil moisture availability throughout the year and in some cases trees taking deeper water in drier conditions tetzlaff et al 2021 it has also been established that uptake from rooting networks especially from large trees integrate waters of varying ages from days to years which can also have internal travel times within the tree days to months before they are sampled in xylem seeger weiler 2021 smith et al 2022 in particular the winter storage of plant xylem water in non transpiring deciduous trees has been shown to fractionate over winter which may be why the first plant xylem water samples in spring are enriched in most of the trees sampled mccutcheon et al 2017 clearly our preliminary results merely scratch the surface of the complexity of water sources for urban trees but the further application of isotopes techniques in studies of plant water relations in urban settings have outstanding potential for elucidating key interactions that have management implications smith et al 2021 5 4 management implications rainfall can be partitioned into blue water such as groundwater recharge or runoff or green water fluxes including evaporation from soils or interception on vegetation surfaces as well as transpiration these new insights into water partitioning in urban green space is timely in the context of management implications cities are increasingly concerned with building resilience for climate change with higher temperatures and altered rainfall regimes changing the boundary conditions for urban design pyke et al 2011 in this context the role of urban green space in providing a areas for infiltration and water retention and b sources of water for et and urban cooling need to be thoroughly understood in different geographical locations where priorities for water management are likely to differ chang et al 2018 obviously enhancing et may reduce groundwater recharge in urban areas where it comprises an important component of water supplies increasing urban tree cover will likely increase green water fluxes though the impacts on blue water fluxes will depend upon factors such as species used planting densities location soil characteristics and management neill et al 2021 tree species previously successfully planted and grown may not be sustainable under climate change scenarios for example shallower rooting trees like beeches fabiani et al 2022 may be more drought susceptible than deeper rooting oaks thomas hartmann 1998 further there is some evidence that species composition can affect overall evapotranspiration rates with higher diversity increasing water losses van peer et al 2004 similarly although urban grasslands generally use less water they are more heavily used recreationally and at the monitoring sites here this resulted in a loss of grass cover over the summer with increased soil evaporation and potentially enhanced runoff from hydrophobic conditions hassane 2011 similar to our work other studies have shown the importance of near surface water sources in sustaining urban grasslands guderle et al 2018 consequently irrigation may need to become more extensive if water is available to subsidise near surface soil water to increase the resilience of existing vegetation to a warmer drier climate rather than the greater expense of using treated tap water or pumped groundwater one could use runoff from roofs or pre treated wastewater to mitigate periods of water stress and increase green water fluxes for berlin gillefalk et al 2021a b the addition of recycled water such as treated wastewater would maintain transpiration particular on grass but also enhance transpiration from trees reducing urban heat increasing groundwater recharge and thus enhancing the social economic value of the greenspace every city will have contrasting priorities and context specific challenges for building resilience to climate changes so it is crucial that an evidence base for understanding plant water interactions in urban green space is rapidly developed this can then help guide implement and assess new green infrastructure in future low impact developments in the management of urban water golden hoghooghi 2018 6 conclusions our unique data set of combined frequent manual monitoring of soil moisture and monthly sampling of bulk soil water stable isotopes over a longer period in an urban setting revealed contrasting patterns of water partitioning and re distribution in the upper critical zone of urban green spaces in a major city berlin in 2020 soils were wetter under grasslands than trees and showed greater effects of evaporative fractionation soils were characterised by rapid water turnover and were dominated by young water i e 2 months old though this influence decreased with depth during the summer little water percolated below the rooting zone with grass almost exclusively using near surface soil moisture to sustain transpirations whilst deeper rooting trees were less dependent on shallow water sources though this varied between species the opportunistic sampling of larger scale surface soil moisture measurement used here provided some preliminary but still highly novel insights into shallow subsurface non hortonian flow paths in urban green spaces however much more detailed information is needed in a wider range of geographical settings to be incorporated into models and quantify variations in the water balance and ecohydrological response times in wet and dry periods of differing longevity such data model fusion is required for an evidence base to manage

3161,water saving through deficit irrigation management is a prominent approach to improving water productivity wp in sustainable agriculture however it is not feasible to assess many irrigation scenarios and their impact on wp therefore crop modeling is a valuable tool for evaluating the effect of different irrigation scenarios on yield and wp no study has evaluated surface irrigation and transition to sprinkler irrigation under different climatic scenarios and irrigation strategies in this study historical remotely sensed crop growth and field measured grain yield gy data were used to calibrate and validate the aquacrop model for a wide wheat cultivated area then the model was used to investigate the impact of different surface deficit irrigation strategies under five different climatic scenarios including wet normal and dry on wp and gy then the model was used to assess the effect of different sprinkler irrigation strategies and their application efficiency on wp and gy under the climatic scenarios based on aquacrop scenario analyses irrigation water requirements varied between 270 and 620 mm in different growing seasons regarding rainfall characteristics amount and distribution also reducing irrigation water by 30 improved wp between 0 and 18 in different growing seasons moreover sprinkler irrigation could improve wp and sustain yield production only in normal and wet years with high application efficiency and proper irrigation strategy otherwise sprinkler irrigation would decrease wp and increase the pressure on water recourses therefore in such areas with erratic rainfalls synchronizing irrigation strategy with the rainfall characteristics increases wp and sustains crop production keywords aquacrop remote sensing sprinkler irrigation deficit irrigation water productivity 1 introduction water is the most critical input for agricultural production and plays an important role in food security due to the increase in the global population a sustainable food production system is required to feed the population sandhu irmak 2019 however land and water resources as the major components of food production in rainfed and irrigated agriculture are limited which are also negatively impacted by climate change and drought abbaspour et al 2009 faramarzi et al 2009 in this regard irrigated agriculture which accounts for about 70 80 of worldwide freshwater withdrawal in the arid and semi arid regions fereres and soriano 2007 foley et al 2011 hoekstra et al 2012 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 vaghefi et al 2019 represents ca 20 of the total cultivated land and contributes ca 40 of the total food produced in the world bruinsma 2017 it is however nearly twice as productive as rainfed agriculture per unit of land it is estimated that the irrigated area should expand more than 20 and the irrigated crop yields should improve by 40 above the current yields for meeting the food requirement in 2025 lascano and sojka 2007 therefore efficient irrigation water management is critical for sustainable crop production and conservation of water resources bjorneberg et al 2020 in this regard improving water productivity wp defined as crop yield per unit of water consumption is a worldwide recommended approach kijne et al 2003 hedley et al 2014 to reduce irrigation water conserve water resources and achieve sustainable agriculture molden et al 2003 kijne et al 2003 kang et al 2017 adetoro et al 2021 bhoutika et al 2022 water saving irrigation managements and strategies that reduce water application combined with sustainable crop production are required to obtain optimum wp in agriculture deficit irrigation defined as the application of irrigation water lower than the full crop water requirements fereres and soriano 2007 ahmadi et al 2010 is proposed as a water saving strategy to increase wp zhao et al 2020 liu and song 2020 pardo et al 2020 however the crop growth stages show diverse responses to different levels of water stress induced by deficit irrigation hochman 1982 gupta et al 2001 xiangxiang et al 2013 therefore knowing or determining the drought tolerant crop growth stages and applying the appropriate deficit irrigation scenarios that lead to the optimum wp is critical in sustainable irrigation water management garcía vila et al 2009 xiangxiang et al 2013 moreover erratic rainfall over different growing seasons would result in diverse irrigation requirements therefore precise irrigation scheduling based on rainfall characteristics and soil water content would result in higher wp by reducing water loss and sustaining crop production li et al 2019 liu and song 2020 nevertheless wp is a temporal and spatial scale dependent water efficiency term molden et al 2003 and is not purely a crop characteristic but affected by climate bowen 2003 climatic demand or evapotranspiration et determines the crop water requirement while crop yield might be more or less independent of climate provided that there are no climatic conditions that act as limiting factors ahmadi et al 2010 therefore the comparison of wps among different climates just indicates the potential of any climate to achieve a certain level of wp however under water stress conditions identifying the water saving irrigation strategies in order to achieve efficient use of irrigation water could be done either by field experiments and or crop modeling field experiments are generally time and cost intensive to assess potential irrigation scenarios greaves and wang 2017 rather the cropping models would provide a cost effective and viable platform to assess the water management strategies for optimizing the use of limited water resources in irrigated agriculture under diverse past present or future climatic conditions garcía vila et al 2009 xiangxiang et al 2013 kisekka et al 2017 masasi et al 2019 crop models generally simulate dynamic crop growth based on complex interactions between environmental and vegetative conditions crop models have been used to analyze the effect of environmental stresses on crops and evaluate diverse crop management scenarios and practices boote et al 1996 farahani et al 2009 most crop models are complex and require numerous input variables sandhu irmak 2019 the aquacrop model raes et al 2009 which has been developed by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao is a water driven crop model that is evaluated successfully on many crops and showed a robust and reliable performance in studying water management and irrigation scenarios in the arid and semi arid areas where are suffering from not reliable irrigation water resources garcía vila et al 2009 araya et al 2010 andarzian et al 2011 wellens et al 2013 xiangxiang et al 2013 ahmadi et al 2015 kim and kaluarachchi 2015 marta et al 2019 purposely aquacrop has been used to study irrigation water levels todorovic et al 2009 mousavizadeh et al 2016 masasi et al 2019 deficit irrigation strategies geerts et al 2010 iqbal et al 2014 ahmadi et al 2015 and farm irrigation management garcía vila et al 2009 heng et al 2009 masasi et al 2020 in addition to deficit irrigation for improving the wp innovative irrigation technologies such as sprinkler irrigation have also been recommended for increasing the wp worldwide hedley et al 2014 liu and shen 2018 liu and song 2020 through i more uniform application of water burt et al 1997 ii reduction of runoff losses and wind drift burt et al 1997 jury and vaux 2007 iii improvement in irrigation scheduling and timely irrigation water delivery as well as addressing crop sensitivity at certain developmental stages jury and vaux 2007 bjorneberg et al 2020 iv use of soil water content monitoring to ensure correct amounts of irrigation water are applied at the right time jury and vaux 2007 bjorneberg et al 2020 therefore simulating the impact of different sprinkler irrigation schedulings and efficiency in diverse climatic conditions i e rainfall amount and distribution on crop production could result in the achievement of improved wp scenarios in a recent comprehensive study in the arid area of the usa bjorneberg et al 2020 showed that converting the furrow irrigation system to sprinkler irrigation can lead to water saving by the farmers which would impact the watershed water balance several studies recommended that sprinkler irrigation would allow for proper water allocation depending on the crop requirement for optimum water saving at large scale compared to surface irrigation skhiri and dechmi 2012 bjorneberg et al 2020 liu and song 2020 showed that aquacrop is a strong modeling and decision making tool in irrigation scheduling and calculating irrigation requirements based on different climatic conditions cropping systems and on demand irrigation practices for improving wp moreover in a recent study davarpanah and ahmadi 2021 used the aquacrop model to simulate winter wheat under regulated deficit irrigation in a large irrigation and drainage network in the hot and humid region southwest of iran they showed that for achieving the highest wheat grain yield gy and wp a combination of regulated di scenarios and the water delivery systems i e rotational and on demand irrigation are the main factors under different climatic variations although previous studies used modeling to assess the effect of deficit irrigation and irrigation scheduling on wp and yield few studies investigated the effect of different water saving irrigation strategies on wp and sustainable crop production under different rainfall characteristics during the growing season moreover the majority of the former applications of the aquacrop were based on either surface irrigation or rainfed conditions due to inherent differences between the surface and sprinkler irrigation in water application on the field that would result in various irrigation efficiencies therefore simulating sprinkler irrigation becomes more complex than surface irrigation on the other hand currently more than 90 of the irrigated lands in iran are under surface irrigation ahmadabad et al 2021 and the public agencies highly recommend farmers adapt sprinkler irrigation to improve wp sabzevar et al 2021 nasrollahi et al 2021 however due to shortage of freshwater resources and heavy pressure on the extremely depleted groundwater resources in the south of iran ahmadi and sedghamiz 2007 ahmadi et al 2018 it is required to adopt efficient sprinkler irrigation systems combined with on demand and rotational irrigation planning and deficit irrigation scenarios subject to different rainfall amount and distribution to meet part of the crop water requirement moreover crop models when applied under different climatic condition scenarios need crop growth historical data that might not always be accessible in such conditions retrieving crop growth information through remote sensing rs techniques is a precise fast and low cost approach recently rs has been used to provide reliable information to facilitate data collection especially in wide cultivated areas zhao et al 2013 trombetta et al 2016 li et al 2017 in this regard crop models can be calibrated and validated by remotely sensed historical crop growth data to improve simulation accuracy and decrease uncertainties li et al 2017 therefore using rs data could be helpful in crop modeling under different water management practices due to the lack of historical information of observed crop growth and vegetative status in many locations worldwide such as iran introducing the rs data in the aquacrop model can substantially help farm managers and researchers calibrate the aquacrop to simulate diverse irrigation scenarios to the best of our knowledge no study has so far focused on the application of aquacrop to evaluate the surface irrigation and transition to sprinkler irrigation management under different deficit irrigation scenarios irrigation scheduling and climate conditions using the historical remotely sensed data of crop growth status during the growing season this study could potentially serve as a valuable and applicable protocol for other researchers and farm engineers worldwide who are curious and concerned about how changing irrigation systems would affect soil hydrology irrigation water requirement wp and crop yield due to the impact of climate change on water resources and rainfall characteristics faramarzi et al 2009 abbaspour et al 2009 hendrix and salehyan 2012 tataw et al 2016 it is necessary to model crop growth and irrigation management and planning based on erratic rainfall amounts and distribution this study partly answers this concern the objectives of this study are i historical based remotely sensed parametrization of aquacrop model in a large wheat cultivated area in a warm and semi arid region in iran to simulate winter wheat growth and gy ii investigate the impact of different deficit irrigation strategies scenarios and systems on gy and wp of winter wheat in different rainfall characteristics iii investigate the effect of transition from surface to sprinkler irrigation based on the induced variations of soil hydrology on reducing irrigation water amount irrigation scheduling and improving wp under different rainfall conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 study area cultivation and irrigation data the study was conducted in the bajgah area school of agriculture shiraz university fars province iran 29 36 n 52 32 e with 1810 msl fig 1 the area is semi arid with a long term annual average rainfall of 386 mm ahmadi et al 2018 table 1 shows the soil s physical properties based on a comprehensive soil physicochemical study solhi 1988 the whole study area has a deep and uniform soil texture with free drainage as described in table 1 in total there are 28 fields in the study area as shown in fig 1 the area of each field is presented in supplementary table 1 the details on cultivation practice irrigation management and scheduling and harvested winter wheat gy in each field from 2012 to 2013 until 2017 2018 growing seasons were obtained from the farm management section of the school of agriculture however due to limited groundwater resources in the region and fallow practice around 8 10 fields were sown each year out of the 28 fields the details of the cultivated fields in each growing season are presented in supplementary table 2 the corresponding harvested gy of each field in each growing season is provided in supplementary table 2 the pishtaz wheat cultivar was grown in all growing seasons as it was the recommended cultivar spii 2015 during the studied growing seasons and depending on the climatic conditions previous field harvest and machinery availability the wheat seeds were mainly sown in november at a rate of 200 250 kg seeds ha 1 the wheat crops were harvested between 14 and 25 june as a local practice the urea 46 n no3 was applied at the rate of 300 kg ha 1 in two broadcasting events after sowing and the beginning of the jointing stage table 2 the irrigation method was border irrigation wheat fields were irrigated six times during the growing seasons details of the irrigation management and scheduling are shown in table 2 2 2 aquacrop model description aquacrop is a water driven model used to simulate daily crop growth steduto et al 2009 it is a simple model and requires a small number of soil and crop parameters which are divided into conservative and non conservative parameters raes et al 2012 the conservative crop parameters are not affected by time location and management and can be used with no or just minor adjustments in simulations however the non conservative parameters change due to the local conditions and crop phenology however the non conservative parameters are not generally calibrated but are obtained from the local information montoya et al 2016 davarpanah and ahmadi 2021 the aquacrop model simulates the yield and biomass of various field and horticultural crops under different environmental field and irrigation managements on a daily time scale in fact the major factors that distinguish aquacrop from the other crop models are its emphasis on crop water use incorporating canopy cover instead of leaf area index and separation of evapotranspiration into soil evaporation and plant transpiration steduto et al 2009 ahmadi et al 2015 therefore accurate simulation of cc is central for precise gy and biomass simulation nyakudya and stroosnijder 2014 vanuytrecht et al 2014 however cc is not frequently measured in field experiments and leaf area index lai is measured as a surrogate for crop growth development since neither cc nor lai was measured during the studied growing seasons we used the remotely sensed lai calculated using the historical images of the landsat 8 oli satellite over the study area for comparison of the simulated cc values by the aquacrop with the remotely sensed based cc of the farms pollock and kanemasu 1979 in this regard several studies have confirmed the robustness and usefulness of the application of the in season remotely sensed lai in the calibration and validation of crop models for yield simulation huang et al 2015 dong et al 2016 xie et al 2017 dhakar et al 2021 the remote sensing images of landsat 8 oli were downloaded from the https earthexplorer usgs gov the acquired images were from march to june for each growing season that included the main growth stages of winter wheat in the region i e jointing booting flowering grain filling and senescence table 2 the dates of downloaded images for each growing season are summarized in supplementary table 3 although the landsat 8 oli images acquisition period is generally 16 days the study area was visible in three different landsat satellite paths and rows over the study area in 7 9 days frequency i e path 162 row 39 path 162 row 40 path 163 row 39 this helped remarkably for higher temporal resolution of lai and cc assessment the image processing to calculate lai was done in the envi software version 5 3 1 fig 2 the remotely sensed lai was converted to cc based on the empirical equation reported for wheat by nielsen et al 2012 which is particularly recommended for use in the aquacrop model as 1 cc 94 00 1 exp 0 43 l a i 0 52 in this equation cc is canopy cover in and lai is leaf area index obtained from landsat images in m2 m 2 water productivity wp kg m 3 was calculated by the following equation 2 wp gy r i where gy is the harvested gy at the end of the growing season in kg r and i are the total amount of rainfall and irrigation water during the growing season in m3 respectively 2 3 calibration and validation of aquacrop so far the aquacrop has not been calibrated and validated in the study area for wheat crops the latest version of the aquacrop model version 6 1 was calibrated and validated based on gy and cc most of the crop models are generally calibrated and validated based on short period field experiments on small plots however in this study the aquacrop model was calibrated and validated over large winter wheat cultivated area and therefore we used relatively long term historical data six consecutive growing seasons of crop growth remotely sensed data and gy field measured data to cover variations of climatic conditions in calibration and validation this approach would represent the real environmental conditions in calibration and validation and makes the calibrated model a stronger and more reliable tool for improved decision making in this regard the model was calibrated for 2012 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 2017 and then was validated for 2013 2014 2015 2016 and 2017 2018 growing seasons every other year was chosen for calibration and validation during the six growing seasons to prevent systematic impacts on modeling inputs and outputs the cumulative rainfall reference evapotranspiration eto and average air temperature for the calibration and validation growing seasons are shown in fig 3 a fig 4 a and fig 4b respectively the weather data was collected from the meteorological station located within field 12 fig 1 the eto was calculated based on the modified penman monteith equation for the study area razzaghi sepaskhah 2012 the measured gy of each cultivated field in each growing season was used for calibration and validation supplementary table 2 due to variations of cc and gy in different fields the standard deviation sd of cc and gy data in each growing season was used to define a statistically significant domain for accurate and reliable simulations the sd is a statistical measure for the dispersion of a dataset from its average consequently the simulated values that fall within the sd of the measured data are a reliable way to validate the accuracy and robustness of the calibration and validation ginoux et al 2004 chiti et al 2010 montoya et al 2016 the aquacrop model was calibrated by trial and error for adjusting the crop parameters such that the simulated cc and gy matched closely to the average of the gy measurements and the remotely sensed cc in the cultivated fields in each growing season supplementary table 2 table 3 shows the calibrated parameters for the winter wheat in the study area otherwise the default model values were used 2 4 statistical indices normalized root mean square error nrmse and residual coefficient error crm was used to evaluate the goodness of calibration and validation which was estimated by the following equations 3 nrmse 1 σ i 1 n o i p i 2 n 4 crm i 1 n o i i 1 n p i i 1 n o i where nrmse is the normalized root mean square error crm is the residual coefficient error oi and pi are observed and predicted values respectively n is the number of observations and σ is the average of observation values nrmse shows the amount of error between observed and predicted values in that case nrmse 0 1 represents the excellent prediction 0 1 nrmse 0 2 represents good performance 0 2 nrmse 0 3 represents fair prediction nrmse 0 3 is poor prediction also crm value indicates the overestimation or underestimation of the prediction compared with observation so approaching crm value to zero represents the fitness of prediction 2 5 growing seasons for irrigation scenario analyses five winter wheat growing seasons including 2003 2004 2007 2008 2009 2010 2010 2011 and 2018 2019 were selected to assess winter wheat growth in different rainfall amounts and distribution the cumulative rainfall eto and average air temperature during the five selected growing seasons are shown in fig 3b fig 4c fig 4d as shown in fig 3b 2003 2004 was a wet growing season with 586 mm rainfall and 2007 2008 was a dry growing season with 127 mm rainfall additionally there are three different normal growing seasons in terms of rainfall distribution such that 2009 2010 is a wet autumn 49 rainfall during autumn with 286 mm rainfall 2010 2011 is a wet winter 89 rainfall during winter with 263 mm rainfall and 2018 2019 is a wet spring 37 rainfall during spring with 372 mm 2 6 deficit irrigation strategies on surface irrigation three deficit irrigation strategies as explained below were used to investigate the wheat crop response to water stress in the five selected growing seasons for irrigation scenario analyses each deficit irrigation strategy includes different irrigation scenarios fig 5 shows the procedure of crop modeling and details of three deficit irrigation strategies in this study none of the deficit irrigation strategies was applied in the first irrigation in the germination stage 1 dap table 2 due to the sensitivity of the wheat seeds in the germination stage 2 6 1 conventional deficit irrigation cdi in this strategy different di scenarios were considered such that a fixed deficit irrigation level was applied on the five in season irrigation events i e jointing booting flowering grain filling and senescence stages table 2 the seven deficit irrigation levels started with 10 deficit irrigation and increased by 10 to 70 the goal of this strategy was to simulate crop growth and yield under mild 10 cdi to severe water 70 cdi stress imposed during the whole growing season after jointing table 2 for example under 10 cdi irrigation depth in any of the five irrigation events will be 90 mm and in total 50 mm will be saved over the five irrigation events likewise under 70 cdi irrigation depth will be 30 mm in each irrigation event and in total 350 mm will be saved 2 6 2 single regulated deficit irrigation srdi this strategy was aimed to assess the crop growth responses to deficit irrigation in a single irrigation event or single growth stage table 2 this strategy will show the most sensitive crop growth stage s that deficit irrigation may suppress crop growth therefore deficit irrigation was imposed separately on any irrigation event i e each growth stage seven levels of deficit irrigation in each growth stage were applied from 10 to 70 with 10 intervals 2 6 3 dual regulated deficit irrigation drdi preliminary modeling output based on the traditional irrigation management of 620 mm in the study area table 2 showed that drainage happened during the jointing and or booting growth stages in all growing seasons for irrigation scenario analysis except the dry growing season of 2007 2008 fig 3 this drainage could result from spring rainfall events that coincided with the irrigation events in the booting and jointing table 2 fig 3 therefore it implied that reducing irrigation amount in these two crop growth stages is possible hence in the drdi strategy two approaches were followed in one approach deficit irrigation was applied in the jointing and booting stages rdij b therefore imposed deficit irrigation on the jointing and booting stages was a combination of 10 to 70 deficit irrigation with 10 intervals in the second approach due to uncertainty in the water supply in late growing seasons crops may be subjected to terminal drought i e drought during grain filling that is the most devastating environmental stress in wheat production habuš jerčić et al 2018 moreover it is well known that high temperatures fig 4 during the terminal drought would cause heat stress which may result in simultaneous heat and water stresses therefore being aware and knowing that combined heat and water stress decreases gy severely fahad et al 2017 luan and vico 2021 solaraju murali et al 2021 we aimed to investigate the effect of terminal drought in different growing seasons for irrigation scenarios analyses thus rdij gf imposed deficit irrigation in the jointing and grain filling stages was a combination of 10 to 70 deficit irrigation with 10 intervals 2 7 sprinkler irrigation scheduling in simulating crop growth and yield under sprinkler irrigation aquacrop can only consider a fraction of total applied water gross irrigation depth that reaches the soil surface net irrigation depth in arid and semi arid areas wind drift and evaporation losses may account for a significant fraction of the total applied water that does not reach the soil surface between 5 and 40 naderi et al 2018 maroufpoor et al 2018 maroufpoor et al 2019 in these situations the calculation of wp based on only net irrigation depth may cause an overestimation in wp indeed the calculation of wp in sprinkler irrigation has to be based on gross irrigation depth total applied water emitted from the sprinkler nozzles therefore gross irrigation depth is needed to estimate wp under sprinkler irrigation thus the gross irrigation depth for calculating wp in sprinkler irrigation was estimated by net irrigation depth and irrigation efficiency as eq 5 5 gross irrigation depth m m net irrigation depth m m irrigation efficiency two sprinkler irrigation efficiencies of 60 as the current sprinkler irrigation efficiency in the region abbasi et al 2017 and 75 as the theoretical sprinkler irrigation efficiency irmak et al 2011 rai et al 2017 were considered to estimate the gross irrigation depth in sprinkler irrigation in addition to develop new sprinkler irrigation strategies different net irrigation scenarios were adapted that are illustrated in fig 5 the details of all sprinkler irrigation strategies and scenarios are shown in table 4 net irrigation depth in eq 5 is based on the irrigation depth values in table 4 which are calculated according to the following sprinkler irrigation strategies it is noticeable that each sprinkler irrigation strategy may include different sprinkler irrigation scenarios regarding the approach of the strategy table 4 2 7 1 traditional based sprinkler irrigation strategy tra and tra the surface irrigation depth in table 2 was converted to the net irrigation depth in sprinkler irrigation table 4 according to the reported surface irrigation efficiencies in the study region as 45 tra and 55 trb abbasi et al 2017 the irrigation depth in surface irrigation scheduling i e 100 mm table 2 was converted to the net irrigation depth in sprinkler irrigation i e 45 mm and 55 mm respectively table 4 then the gross irrigation depth total applied water in sprinkler irrigation was calculated by sprinkler irrigation efficiencies i e 60 and 75 based on eq 5 it should be noted that the irrigation in the germination stage 1 dap table 2 was remained constant 120 mm table 2 due to reducing the risk of water stress in the germination especially in dry growing seasons 2 7 2 rotational based sprinkler irrigation strategy ro in this strategy sprinkler irrigation was scheduled based on the experimental approach of mehrabi and sepaskhah 2018 this study has made an irrigation scheduling for winter wheat in the study area for two growing seasons by measuring soil water deficit and then increasing soil water content to field capacity due to the different climatic conditions in different growing seasons regarding rainfall amount and distribution some irrigation depths in the mehrabi and sepaskhah 2018 study did not increase soil water content to field capacity in some growing seasons therefore in some irrigation events the soil water content reached field capacity by increasing irrigation depth manually in the model table 4 2 7 3 constraint based sprinkler irrigation strategy cb in this strategy four constraints were considered to determine the depth and the date of irrigation events in each growing season as i considering at least 10 day irrigation frequency due to decrease the risks of crops fungal diseases induced by high humidity ii between 1 and 200 dap no water stress should occur such as canopy expansion stress in vegetative growth stomatal closure and early senescence stresses in reproductive growth as defined in aquacrop model iii setting an irrigation event at the beginning of the flowering stage to ensure no water stress during this stage iv increasing soil water content to field capacity in each irrigation event these constraints are recommended by the local experts and the farm management section 2 7 4 conditional rotational based sprinkler irrigation strategy cr the relationship between gy and irrigation amount in all deficit irrigation scenarios will be explained in section 3 5 showed that the total irrigation water 620 mm table 2 could be reduced by 150 mm without gy loss i e 470 mm total net irrigation depth in this strategy 120 mm of irrigation was considered for germination 1 dap and the rest of the irrigation amount 470 120 350 was applied in five irrigation events equally such that no drainage happened 70 mm in each irrigation event table 4 however the date of irrigation events in each growing season was determined based on simulated soil water content by the aquacrop such that when the soil water content was depleted to 65 of the total available water psto upper 0 65 as the upper threshold for stomatal closure table 3 an irrigation event was applied to avoid water stress on stomatal opening in this strategy an irrigation event was set based on the depleted soil water content therefore due to the diverse rainfall amounts in different growing seasons there was no fixed number of irrigation events or fixed irrigation events in a specific growth period in addition due to the high rainfall amounts during the spring of 2018 2019 five irrigation events were sufficient to prevent water stress on stomatal opening during the growing season which means 400 mm of net irrigation was enough table 4 2 7 5 water saving based sprinkler irrigation strategy ws this strategy which is a novel irrigation scheduling approach for sprinkler irrigation in the study area was mainly developed based on the results of the deficit irrigation scenarios section 2 6 in this approach the most proper deficit irrigation scenarios which improved wp with slight gy reduction were considered based on the results of all deficit irrigation scenarios on wp reducing the total irrigation from 620 mm to 420 mm would increase wp with a minor gy loss therefore 200 mm could be saved 120 mm out of 420 mm was applied in the germination stage then in total 60 mm out of 300 mm was applied during the jointing and booting stage based on the results of drdij b i e 70 deficit irrigation section 2 6 3 and the rest of 240 mm were equally distributed in the remaining growth stages on flowering grain filling and senescence stages table 4 and table 2 3 results 3 1 aquacrop calibration and validation fig 6 shows the remotely sensed and simulated cc by aquacrop in the calibration and validation in the calibration aquacrop showed excellent performance in cc simulation in the middle of the growing season between 130 and 190 dap when cc was maximum a minor overestimation appeared in the cc simulation after 190 dap with decreasing cc at the beginning of the senescence stage table 2 although the cc simulation in the late growing season was not so accurate as in the middle of the growing seasons the model correctly simulated the decreasing trend of cc fig 6 fig 6 also shows the remotely sensed and simulated cc in the validation the simulation of cc in the validation was very accurate in the middle of all growing seasons 130 190 dap except in 2017 2018 in which the remotely sensed cc between 176 and 185 dap increased sharply however the model could not follow the increase in the cc pattern fig 7 shows the simulated and measured gy in calibration and validation slight overestimation was found in the aquacrop simulations low nrmse and crm values indicate that aquacrop simulated winter wheat gy precisely the model slightly underestimated gy in the validation though the nrmse and crm values indicate excellent model simulations however the simulations in the calibration and validation were fully in the domain of sd which means that the simulations were well in the range of observed gy values of 8 10 fields supplementary table 2 3 2 simulations of soil hydrology processes in the growing seasons for irrigation scenarios under the traditional surface irrigation management table 2 the calibrated and validated aquacrop was used to simulate the winter wheat growth and gy in five different and non consecutive growing seasons with diverse climatic conditions table 5 the simulated daily soil hydrology and the soil water content variations in the growing seasons for irrigation scenario analyses are illustrated in fig 8 the simulated gy in the five selected growing seasons varied between 5 986 and 7 029 mg ha 1 the lowest and the highest simulated gy productions were in 2004 2005 and 2009 2010 respectively additionally in the five growing seasons wp and drainage varied between 0 5 and 0 84 kg m 3 and 13 and 479 mm respectively the wet growing season 2004 2005 showed the lowest wp due to the highest rainfall amount and consequently the highest drainage while the highest wp was in the dry growing season 2007 2008 due to the lowest rainfall amount and lowest drainage table 5 in fig 8 in wet and normal growing seasons high amounts of drainage in different crop stages show over irrigation which causes excess drainage therefore reducing irrigation depth or deficit irrigation can reduce drainage and improve wp 3 3 simulation of gy and wp under deficit irrigation 3 3 1 conventional deficit irrigation cdi fig 9 shows simulated wp and gy of winter wheat under 10 to 70 cdi wp showed different responses to cdi in different growing seasons due to diverse rainfall conditions fig 3b in 2018 2019 wp had a constantly increasing trend and cdi 70 increased wp by 48 compared to those wp under the traditional irrigation management table 5 due to the high rainfall in the spring and no gy reduction fig 3b in 2004 2005 10 to 60 of cdi did not affect wp considerably and cdi 70 decreased wp by 18 in 2009 2010 and 2010 2011 the highest wp was observed in cdi 50 which increased wp by 23 and 27 respectively in contrast in 2007 2008 10 to 70 of cdi decreased wp from 0 84 kg m 3 to 0 21 kg m 3 due to low rainfall and low soil water content fig 3b and fig 8 due to the strategic and economic importance of the winter wheat high gy reduction caused by deficit irrigation may not be acceptable by farmers and public organizations thus gy production under all cdi scenarios was investigated in detail fig 9b shows winter wheat gy under different levels of cdi in five growing seasons in 2007 2008 gy decreased sharply under cdi due to low rainfall and severe water stress fig 3b alternatively 10 to 40 of cdi did not decrease gy significantly in normal and wet growing seasons in 2018 2019 cdi did not affect gy due to high rainfall during spring fig 3b this shows the significance of spring rainfall for maintaining winter wheat gy under different levels of conventional deficit irrigation 3 3 2 single regulated deficit irrigation srdi different levels of deficit irrigation were imposed on any irrigation event or growth stage except the first irrigation germination stage table 2 as srdi the wp and gy under srdi simulations for the selected growing seasons are shown in fig 10 a and fig 10b respectively the effect of 10 to 70 deficit irrigation on the wp and gy of each growth stage is shown as the mean sd to summarize the results of 175 simulated scenarios in this section as shown in fig 10 srdi improved wp in comparison with table 5 with no gy reduction in any growth stages for all growing seasons except 2007 2008 the srdi increased wp between null to 9 in different growing seasons the highest increment of wp was observed in 2010 2011 wet winter and the lowest was in 2007 2008 dry in 2007 2008 srdi in different growth stages positively affected wp while suppressed gy production the highest gy reduction was attributed to 2007 2008 in which 70 of srdi in the jointing stage decreased gy by 10 compared to the gy under traditional irrigation management table 5 fig 10 fig 10 indicates that 10 to 70 deficit irrigation in winter wheat growth stages table 2 improved wp with no remarkable gy reduction in the wet and normal growing seasons in contrast significant gy reduction was observed under srdi in jointing and booting stages in the dry growing season this reveals that proper irrigation management under jointing and booting stages is important for sustainable crop production 3 3 3 dual regulated deficit irrigation strategy drdi simulations showed high amounts of drainage occurred during the jointing and booting stages of winter wheat in normal and wet growing seasons under the traditional irrigation management fig 8 and table 5 thus deficit irrigation was imposed in the jointing and booting stages rdij b and jointing and grain filling stages rdij gf to increase wp fig 11 shows the simulated gy and wp of winter wheat under rdi scenarios in different growing seasons the specific rdi scenario which resulted in the highest wp in each growing season has been mentioned beside each box in fig 11 in general in comparison with table 5 rdij b increased wp between null 2007 2008 and 20 2010 2011 in all five growing seasons fig 11b reducing 70 of irrigation depth in both jointing and booting stages increased wp with minor or null gy reduction in all growing seasons except 2007 2008 fig 11b and d as shown in the 3 3 2 section rdij b had a suppressing effect on gy in 2007 2008 rdij b scenarios reduced gy between 2 and 20 in 2007 2008 however in 2007 2008 wp slightly increased under 10 and 30 of di in the jointing and booting stages j10 b30 respectively therefore based on the simulations rdij b could be applied in normal and wet growing seasons to increase wp with sustainable crop production moreover winter wheat gy and wp was also simulated under deficit irrigation in jointing and grain filling stages rdij gf to assess the impact of terminal drought on the crop fig 11a and b results showed that rdij gf did not affect gy in normal and wet growing seasons based on the simulations in fig 11a rdij gf increased wp between null 2007 2008 and 19 2010 2011 in all five growing seasons the gy reduction was observed only in 2007 2008 in which gy decreased between null and 17 under different levels of rdij gf fig 11b therefore reducing 70 of irrigation depth in the jointing and grain filling stages resulted in increasing wp with no gy reduction in all growing seasons except 2007 2008 in contrast rdij gf reduced gy remarkably in 2007 2008 3 4 relationship between grain yield production deficit irrigation and water productivity fig 12 shows the simulation of winter wheat wp and gy under all cdi srdi and drdi scenarios against irrigation water depth each point in fig 12 represents the gy or wp of any single deficit irrigation scenario under cdi srdi and drdi strategies in all growing seasons except 2007 2008 irrigation depth higher than 470 mm did not contribute to crop production fig 12b in addition reducing irrigation depth to 470 mm increased wp by 18 compared to traditional irrigation management table 5 in 2009 2010 2010 2011 and 2018 2019 10 in 2004 2005 and did not affect wp in 2007 2008 furthermore in fig 12a 420 mm of irrigation increased wp by 24 compared to table 5 in 2009 2010 and 2018 2019 22 in 2010 2011 12 in 2004 2005 and 6 in 2007 2008 overall irrigation depth below 420 mm in all growing seasons except the wet spring reduced gy compared to the threshold gy production simulated under 420 mm fig 12b 3 5 adaptive and non adaptive irrigation managements in the previous section we assumed that deficit irrigation practices are adaptive such that farm managers can manage the irrigation under different climatic conditions without any restriction of water resources however due to several uncertainties in rainfall events and water supply such as break down or failure of the pumping systems regulation in groundwater extraction water laws the crops would likely be experiencing different levels of unexpected and unregulated water stress during the main growth stages table 2 to address this uncertainty in gy and wp simulation we defined a series of non adaptive combined deficit irrigation scenarios that may likely happen during the wheat growth supplementary tables 4 and 5 summarize the non adaptive irrigation management scenarios and the simulated gy and wp respectively we considered different combinations of specific deficit irrigation levels during the jointing to senescence growth stages supplementary table 5 shows the recommended scenarios bold numbers in each growing season based on the highest simulated wp and the relative grain yield rgy compared to the traditional surface irrigation scheduling table 2 and table 5 the results showed that different non adaptive deficit irrigation scenarios improved wp with minor or no gy reduction in all five growing seasons even in the dry year in all growing seasons wp varied between 0 14 kg m 3 and 1 kg m 3 obtained in 2004 2005 and 2009 2010 respectively furthermore the results showed that all non adaptive scenarios increased wp in 2009 2010 wet autumn and 2018 2019 wet spring although their rgy varied between 60 96 and 100 generally these scenarios provide a beneficial tool in crop production management to improve wp and water management in drought conditions where water supply is limited 3 6 simulating water productivity and grain yield under sprinkler irrigation in all sprinkler irrigation scenarios table 4 the net irrigation depth varied between 345 mm and 880 mm the wide range of irrigation depth in sprinkler scenarios indicates that these scenarios were provided considering different rainfall conditions table 6 shows the simulation of winter wheat wp and rgy under different sprinkler irrigation scenarios with 60 and 75 application efficiency in five growing seasons we compared wp and gy under sprinkler scenarios and traditional surface irrigation management thus in table 6 wp values higher than those in table 5 are shown in bold also rgy relative grain yield values greater or equal to 95 are shown in bold the wp and rgy varied between 0 38 kg ha 1 to 0 87 kg ha 1 and 43 to 108 respectively the impact of sprinkler irrigation on wp varied between 55 and 32 compared with table 5 the highest wp was in 2018 2019 under ro strategy with 75 of sprinkler irrigation application efficiency in contrast the lowest wp was in 2007 2008 under tra strategy with 60 of sprinkler irrigation application efficiency the results clearly showed that 60 of sprinkler irrigation application efficiency decreased wp under all sprinkler irrigation scenarios mainly except in 2018 2019 compared to those under the traditional surface irrigation management table 5 in 2004 2005 with low spring rainfall fig 3b all sprinkler irrigation scenarios had a negative or marginal positive impact on wp also all sprinkler irrigation scenarios reduced wp in 2007 2008 due to a dry year fig 3b alternatively all sprinkler irrigation scenarios with 75 sprinkler irrigation application efficiency increased wp in 2018 2019 with wet spring fig 3b with 75 of application efficiency ws and cb strategies increased wp in all growing seasons except the dry year 2007 2008 under ro and cb strategies rgys were higher or equal to 95 but the corresponding wps were lower than those obtained under the traditional surface irrigation management except in 2018 2019 table 5 furthermore cr and ws strategies showed good gy and wp improvement only in normal and wet growing seasons rgy 96 generally based on table 6 cr and ws strategies which were developed based on the deficit irrigation scenarios section 2 6 improved wp and gy compared to the other sprinkler irrigation strategies 4 discussion 4 1 aquacrop simulation and assessment fig 6 and fig 7 show that aquacrop accurately simulates winter wheat cc and gy in fig 6 the overestimation in the simulation of cc in the late calibration growing seasons could be attributed to neglecting the effect of high temperature on cc by the aquacrop model andarzian et al 2011 xiangxiang et al 2013 trombetta et al 2016 han et al 2020 in fact other researchers have also indicated the overestimation of cc by aquacrop during the late season and senescence ahmadi et al 2015 the overestimation of aquacrop in simulation cc in the late growing season would also affect the final gy simulation because aquacrop estimates gy through cc steduto et al 2009 raes et al 2009 however the nrmse values in fig 7 show that the model could precisely estimate wheat gy during the six consecutive growing seasons accurate simulations of gy in calibration and validation fig 7 clearly demonstrate that using aquacrop in those regions that there are no previous historical reports or observations of crop growth data cc calculation according to the remotely sensed based lai is an accurate reliable and low cost method in simulating winter wheat cc and gy other studies have also shown that using crop remotely sensed growth data in aquacrop is a precise and straightforward method to simulate different crops growth including wheat maize alfalfa barley and tomato trombetta et al 2016 kim and kaluarachchi 2015 marta et al 2019 corbari et al 2021 other studies have also shown that using remotely sensed data in aquacrop modeling helped estimate crop water requirement marta et al 2019 and irrigation scheduling corbari et al 2021 therefore the results imply that aquacrop is a robust crop growth model in optimizing irrigation scheduling and evaluating crop response to different irrigation managements and scenarios under different climatic conditions garcía vila et al 2009 geerts et al 2010 4 2 deficit irrigation based on the results of cdi scenarios fig 9 reducing irrigation water to 470 mm 30 cdi increases wp with no significant gy reduction except in dry growing seasons in this context other studies confirmed our results and proposed cdi to improve wp fereres and soriano 2007 farré and faci 2009 davarpanah and ahmadi 2021 investigated the irrigation scheduling of wheat in a hot and warm climate in the southwest of iran where its climate is greatly different from our study area they reported that imposing cdi 40 increases wp and imposing higher levels of cdi would decrease wp and gy sharply especially in dry growing seasons zhao et al 2020 recommended imposing mild water stress 40 to increase wheat wp and water use efficiency with minor gy reduction however in our study the cdi 30 is the recommended irrigation management in normal and wet growing seasons to improve wp with no gy reduction fig 9 the results of srdi and rdij b show that the jointing and booting are the most sensitive stages versus water stress respectively table 2 fig 10 and fig 11b however fig 10 shows that imposing any level of srdi on any growth stage increases wp and does not affect gy in normal and wet growing seasons it seems rainfall during jointing and booting stages in normal and wet growing seasons prevents crop water stress fig 3b fig 8 fig 10 and fig 11b our study confirms the previous study in this area which revealed that water stress during the jointing stage reduces gy remarkably mehrabi and sepaskhah 2019 many studies have also confirmed that water stress in jointing and booting stages of wheat decreased gy and wp hochman 1982 gupta et al 2001 xiangxiang et al 2013 liu et al 2016 the srdi and rdij b indicate that although imposing deficit irrigation during the jointing and booting stages in low rainfall conditions does not reduce wp it would severely cause gy reduction this shows the high interaction of irrigation water and rainfall on sustaining wheat gy in the study area the effect of rdij gf in the jointing and grain filling stages of winter wheat on gy and wp was investigated to assess the impact of terminal drought fig 11 the results show that terminal drought reduces gy and wp only in dry growing seasons no gy reduction was observed in normal and wet growing seasons and rdij gf increased wp in this context regarding the high temperature in the late growing seasons fig 4d the crop may be under heat stress rdij gf imposes water stress during the jointing and grain filling the late growing season stages table 2 therefore under rdij gf scenarios crops may simultaneously face heat and water stress in the late growing season many studies reported that combined heat and water stress had a devastating multiplicative effect on gy reduction barnabás et al 2008 fahad et al 2017 luan and vico 2021 solaraju murali et al 2021 aquacrop does not consider heat stress in the late growing season andarzian et al 2011 trombetta et al 2016 han et al 2020 thus the model may not accurately simulate crop growth under rdij gb scenarios it seems aquacrop is weak in the simulation of crop growth and consequently soil hydrology processes under terminal drought it is recommended that future versions of the model would include the effect of heat stress on the whole water relations of plants and soil in the aquacrop generally results of crop response to deficit irrigation managements show that a properly managed deficit irrigation practice cdi srdi drdi could be applied in winter wheat fields as a water saving irrigation strategy to increase wp and conserve water resources results of cdi fig 9 srdi fig 10 rdij b fig 11 and simulated drainage in different growing seasons table 5 and fig 8 show that the traditional surface irrigation management in the study area table 2 is basically suitable and applicable mostly for low rainfall conditions or dry growing seasons thus applying the traditional irrigation scheduling table 2 would cause much water loss through drainage in normal and wet growing seasons table 5 and fig 8 figs 9 10 and 11 show that rainfall amount and distribution are critical factors in designing a proper and dynamic climate based irrigation scheduling and selecting the most productive deficit irrigation strategy in the study area therefore in such areas with erratic rainfall events fig 3b irrigation scheduling based on the rainfall condition of each growing season would lead to higher wp improved achievement in saving water in wet growing seasons and sustainable crop production in dry growing seasons in our study the relationship between gy production and deficit irrigation shows irrigation water requirement varies between 270 and 620 mm in different growing seasons depending on the rainfall condition fig 8 also non adaptive scenarios were provided and simulated by aquacrop to guide farmers in managing unexpected water stress therefore aquacrop could serve powerful modeling and decision making tool to guide farmers in selecting proper irrigation management and planning based on water supply climatic and rainfall conditions under climate change therefore enhancing the climate resilience of irrigated agriculture such as irrigation management and irrigation method sprinkler irrigation is required to improve water use management and crop production hedley et al 2014 ward 2022 4 3 sprinkler irrigation scheduling based on the results of our simulations table 6 sprinkler irrigation in the dry growing season of 2007 2008 mostly decreased wp and gy in general since under low rainfall conditions crop water requirement is solely dependent on irrigation therefore crop water requirement shall be supplied through the sprinkler irrigation system which implies more frequent irrigation events and higher irrigation depth per irrigation event table 4 this will certainly increase more water loss wind drift or evaporation through a higher number of irrigation events in dry years than wet years when part of the crop water requirement is met by rainfall that indeed does not bear any losses such as wind drift or evaporation this is a very critical point in sprinkler irrigation system management under dry conditions to adapt irrigation schedulings such as over night irrigation or by improvement in designing the systems such as the layout of the laterals and sprinklers that reduce the risk of water loss zareabyaneh et al 2019 therefore wp and or gy of wheat under sprinkler irrigation in dry climates could potentially be improved by appropriate system management and design to increase soil water content in the root zone without drainage fig 8 this concern has also been recently argued by bjorneberg et al 2020 that in order to increase irrigation efficicny in changing furrow irrigation to sprinkler irrigation in an arid region irrigation scheduling should be based on soil moisture measurement or daily et to match crop water requirement on individual fields therfeore any amount of irrigation water that is lost due to higher evaporation wind drift and losses through deep percolation bjorneberg et al 2020 faryabi et al 2020 during the growing season will consequently not contribute to gy production thus increasing the gross irrigation amount does not necessarily result in a higher gy in general it is believed that sprinkler irrigation would increase wp in the arid and semi arid areas by saving more water ghadami firouzabadi et al 2020 bjorneberg et al 2020 however our analysis and results showed that higher wp under sprinkler irrigation could not always be achieved other researchers reported similar findings in agreement with our results maroufpoor et al 2019 abbasi et al 2017 moulaee et al 2016 skhiri and dechmi 2012 fard et al 2020 showed decreasing wp and gy under sprinkler irrigation compared with flood irrigation seyedan et al 2018 investigated wheat wp and gy under sprinkler and surface irrigation and showed that although sprinkler irrigation increased wp it caused remarkable gy reduction thus it is clear that high wp under sprinkler irrigation could be achieved through proper sprinkler irrigation management and strategy based on climatic conditions therefore rainfall amount and its distribution along the growing season should be considered in sprinkler irrigation management for proper water allocation to increase gy and wp in this regard liu and song 2020 argued that irrigation systems are developed and invested but the potential wp is not achieved yet due to poor relevance knowledge of irrigation systems operators our study shows that although sprinkler irrigation increases wp in normal and wet growing seasons it is not a productive irrigation method in drought conditions furthermore more frequent mild to severe drought events in the future dai 2013 vaghefi et al 2019 may limit the usage of sprinkler irrigation systems in arid and semi arid areas based on the results of our study moreover in such areas with highly erratic and uncertain annual rainfalls irrigation strategies must be synchronized according to the rainfall characteristics amount and distribution and soil water content during the growing season in order to increase wp and sustainable gy production supplementary table 5 and supplementary table 6 can help farmers managers water allocators and stakeholders to select and design the proper irrigation scheduling synchronized based on the climatic condition of the growing season weather and rainfall forecast technologies may help in advance for real time irrigation scheduling rao et al 1992 wang and cai 2009 cai et al 2011 lorite et al 2015 specific system design management and operation of sprinkler systems are essential to increase the application efficiency under dry conditions to improve wp and water resources conservation bjorneberg et al 2020 faryabi et al 2020 5 conclusion in this study the water driven aquacrop model was calibrated and validated to simulate winter wheat growth and gy under the surface irrigation scheduling in different growing seasons due to the lack of historical crop growth data remotely sensed lai provided crop growth data in calibration and validation then the calibrated and validated aquacrop model was used to simulate wheat growth and gy in five different growing seasons under different irrigation scenarios to investigate the effect of deficit irrigation on gy and wp the results showed that remotely sensed crop growth data are helpful in the calibration and validation of the aquacrop model aquacrop simulation of winter wheat growth in the five growing seasons showed that the traditional surface irrigation management is based on low rainfall conditions to avoid gy loss induced by water stress therefore it caused a remarkable water loss in normal and wet growing seasons also simulated winter wheat growth and gy under different deficit irrigation scenarios showed that reducing irrigation depth by 150 mm can improve wp with no gy reduction in normal and wet growing seasons in such climates with erratic rainfall fixed irrigation management would result in high water loss in normal and wet growing seasons therefore deficit irrigation could be applied to save water in normal and wet years as a result flexible irrigation scheduling is recommended to conserve water resources in normal and wet growing seasons and sustain crop production in dry growing seasons aquacrop was used to simulate wheat gy and wp under different sprinkler irrigation scheduling with different application efficiency the results indicated that sprinkler irrigation with an application efficiency of 60 decreased wp due to high water losses and irrigation water requirements based on simulations ws and cr sprinkler irrigation strategies with 75 sprinkler irrigation efficiency improved wp with no significant gy reduction only in normal and wet growing seasons alternatively sprinkler irrigation increased water requirements in dry growing seasons compared with surface irrigation scheduling and decreased wp table 2 therefore sprinkler irrigation in dry years would increase the pressure on water recourses declaration of competing

3161,water saving through deficit irrigation management is a prominent approach to improving water productivity wp in sustainable agriculture however it is not feasible to assess many irrigation scenarios and their impact on wp therefore crop modeling is a valuable tool for evaluating the effect of different irrigation scenarios on yield and wp no study has evaluated surface irrigation and transition to sprinkler irrigation under different climatic scenarios and irrigation strategies in this study historical remotely sensed crop growth and field measured grain yield gy data were used to calibrate and validate the aquacrop model for a wide wheat cultivated area then the model was used to investigate the impact of different surface deficit irrigation strategies under five different climatic scenarios including wet normal and dry on wp and gy then the model was used to assess the effect of different sprinkler irrigation strategies and their application efficiency on wp and gy under the climatic scenarios based on aquacrop scenario analyses irrigation water requirements varied between 270 and 620 mm in different growing seasons regarding rainfall characteristics amount and distribution also reducing irrigation water by 30 improved wp between 0 and 18 in different growing seasons moreover sprinkler irrigation could improve wp and sustain yield production only in normal and wet years with high application efficiency and proper irrigation strategy otherwise sprinkler irrigation would decrease wp and increase the pressure on water recourses therefore in such areas with erratic rainfalls synchronizing irrigation strategy with the rainfall characteristics increases wp and sustains crop production keywords aquacrop remote sensing sprinkler irrigation deficit irrigation water productivity 1 introduction water is the most critical input for agricultural production and plays an important role in food security due to the increase in the global population a sustainable food production system is required to feed the population sandhu irmak 2019 however land and water resources as the major components of food production in rainfed and irrigated agriculture are limited which are also negatively impacted by climate change and drought abbaspour et al 2009 faramarzi et al 2009 in this regard irrigated agriculture which accounts for about 70 80 of worldwide freshwater withdrawal in the arid and semi arid regions fereres and soriano 2007 foley et al 2011 hoekstra et al 2012 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 vaghefi et al 2019 represents ca 20 of the total cultivated land and contributes ca 40 of the total food produced in the world bruinsma 2017 it is however nearly twice as productive as rainfed agriculture per unit of land it is estimated that the irrigated area should expand more than 20 and the irrigated crop yields should improve by 40 above the current yields for meeting the food requirement in 2025 lascano and sojka 2007 therefore efficient irrigation water management is critical for sustainable crop production and conservation of water resources bjorneberg et al 2020 in this regard improving water productivity wp defined as crop yield per unit of water consumption is a worldwide recommended approach kijne et al 2003 hedley et al 2014 to reduce irrigation water conserve water resources and achieve sustainable agriculture molden et al 2003 kijne et al 2003 kang et al 2017 adetoro et al 2021 bhoutika et al 2022 water saving irrigation managements and strategies that reduce water application combined with sustainable crop production are required to obtain optimum wp in agriculture deficit irrigation defined as the application of irrigation water lower than the full crop water requirements fereres and soriano 2007 ahmadi et al 2010 is proposed as a water saving strategy to increase wp zhao et al 2020 liu and song 2020 pardo et al 2020 however the crop growth stages show diverse responses to different levels of water stress induced by deficit irrigation hochman 1982 gupta et al 2001 xiangxiang et al 2013 therefore knowing or determining the drought tolerant crop growth stages and applying the appropriate deficit irrigation scenarios that lead to the optimum wp is critical in sustainable irrigation water management garcía vila et al 2009 xiangxiang et al 2013 moreover erratic rainfall over different growing seasons would result in diverse irrigation requirements therefore precise irrigation scheduling based on rainfall characteristics and soil water content would result in higher wp by reducing water loss and sustaining crop production li et al 2019 liu and song 2020 nevertheless wp is a temporal and spatial scale dependent water efficiency term molden et al 2003 and is not purely a crop characteristic but affected by climate bowen 2003 climatic demand or evapotranspiration et determines the crop water requirement while crop yield might be more or less independent of climate provided that there are no climatic conditions that act as limiting factors ahmadi et al 2010 therefore the comparison of wps among different climates just indicates the potential of any climate to achieve a certain level of wp however under water stress conditions identifying the water saving irrigation strategies in order to achieve efficient use of irrigation water could be done either by field experiments and or crop modeling field experiments are generally time and cost intensive to assess potential irrigation scenarios greaves and wang 2017 rather the cropping models would provide a cost effective and viable platform to assess the water management strategies for optimizing the use of limited water resources in irrigated agriculture under diverse past present or future climatic conditions garcía vila et al 2009 xiangxiang et al 2013 kisekka et al 2017 masasi et al 2019 crop models generally simulate dynamic crop growth based on complex interactions between environmental and vegetative conditions crop models have been used to analyze the effect of environmental stresses on crops and evaluate diverse crop management scenarios and practices boote et al 1996 farahani et al 2009 most crop models are complex and require numerous input variables sandhu irmak 2019 the aquacrop model raes et al 2009 which has been developed by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao is a water driven crop model that is evaluated successfully on many crops and showed a robust and reliable performance in studying water management and irrigation scenarios in the arid and semi arid areas where are suffering from not reliable irrigation water resources garcía vila et al 2009 araya et al 2010 andarzian et al 2011 wellens et al 2013 xiangxiang et al 2013 ahmadi et al 2015 kim and kaluarachchi 2015 marta et al 2019 purposely aquacrop has been used to study irrigation water levels todorovic et al 2009 mousavizadeh et al 2016 masasi et al 2019 deficit irrigation strategies geerts et al 2010 iqbal et al 2014 ahmadi et al 2015 and farm irrigation management garcía vila et al 2009 heng et al 2009 masasi et al 2020 in addition to deficit irrigation for improving the wp innovative irrigation technologies such as sprinkler irrigation have also been recommended for increasing the wp worldwide hedley et al 2014 liu and shen 2018 liu and song 2020 through i more uniform application of water burt et al 1997 ii reduction of runoff losses and wind drift burt et al 1997 jury and vaux 2007 iii improvement in irrigation scheduling and timely irrigation water delivery as well as addressing crop sensitivity at certain developmental stages jury and vaux 2007 bjorneberg et al 2020 iv use of soil water content monitoring to ensure correct amounts of irrigation water are applied at the right time jury and vaux 2007 bjorneberg et al 2020 therefore simulating the impact of different sprinkler irrigation schedulings and efficiency in diverse climatic conditions i e rainfall amount and distribution on crop production could result in the achievement of improved wp scenarios in a recent comprehensive study in the arid area of the usa bjorneberg et al 2020 showed that converting the furrow irrigation system to sprinkler irrigation can lead to water saving by the farmers which would impact the watershed water balance several studies recommended that sprinkler irrigation would allow for proper water allocation depending on the crop requirement for optimum water saving at large scale compared to surface irrigation skhiri and dechmi 2012 bjorneberg et al 2020 liu and song 2020 showed that aquacrop is a strong modeling and decision making tool in irrigation scheduling and calculating irrigation requirements based on different climatic conditions cropping systems and on demand irrigation practices for improving wp moreover in a recent study davarpanah and ahmadi 2021 used the aquacrop model to simulate winter wheat under regulated deficit irrigation in a large irrigation and drainage network in the hot and humid region southwest of iran they showed that for achieving the highest wheat grain yield gy and wp a combination of regulated di scenarios and the water delivery systems i e rotational and on demand irrigation are the main factors under different climatic variations although previous studies used modeling to assess the effect of deficit irrigation and irrigation scheduling on wp and yield few studies investigated the effect of different water saving irrigation strategies on wp and sustainable crop production under different rainfall characteristics during the growing season moreover the majority of the former applications of the aquacrop were based on either surface irrigation or rainfed conditions due to inherent differences between the surface and sprinkler irrigation in water application on the field that would result in various irrigation efficiencies therefore simulating sprinkler irrigation becomes more complex than surface irrigation on the other hand currently more than 90 of the irrigated lands in iran are under surface irrigation ahmadabad et al 2021 and the public agencies highly recommend farmers adapt sprinkler irrigation to improve wp sabzevar et al 2021 nasrollahi et al 2021 however due to shortage of freshwater resources and heavy pressure on the extremely depleted groundwater resources in the south of iran ahmadi and sedghamiz 2007 ahmadi et al 2018 it is required to adopt efficient sprinkler irrigation systems combined with on demand and rotational irrigation planning and deficit irrigation scenarios subject to different rainfall amount and distribution to meet part of the crop water requirement moreover crop models when applied under different climatic condition scenarios need crop growth historical data that might not always be accessible in such conditions retrieving crop growth information through remote sensing rs techniques is a precise fast and low cost approach recently rs has been used to provide reliable information to facilitate data collection especially in wide cultivated areas zhao et al 2013 trombetta et al 2016 li et al 2017 in this regard crop models can be calibrated and validated by remotely sensed historical crop growth data to improve simulation accuracy and decrease uncertainties li et al 2017 therefore using rs data could be helpful in crop modeling under different water management practices due to the lack of historical information of observed crop growth and vegetative status in many locations worldwide such as iran introducing the rs data in the aquacrop model can substantially help farm managers and researchers calibrate the aquacrop to simulate diverse irrigation scenarios to the best of our knowledge no study has so far focused on the application of aquacrop to evaluate the surface irrigation and transition to sprinkler irrigation management under different deficit irrigation scenarios irrigation scheduling and climate conditions using the historical remotely sensed data of crop growth status during the growing season this study could potentially serve as a valuable and applicable protocol for other researchers and farm engineers worldwide who are curious and concerned about how changing irrigation systems would affect soil hydrology irrigation water requirement wp and crop yield due to the impact of climate change on water resources and rainfall characteristics faramarzi et al 2009 abbaspour et al 2009 hendrix and salehyan 2012 tataw et al 2016 it is necessary to model crop growth and irrigation management and planning based on erratic rainfall amounts and distribution this study partly answers this concern the objectives of this study are i historical based remotely sensed parametrization of aquacrop model in a large wheat cultivated area in a warm and semi arid region in iran to simulate winter wheat growth and gy ii investigate the impact of different deficit irrigation strategies scenarios and systems on gy and wp of winter wheat in different rainfall characteristics iii investigate the effect of transition from surface to sprinkler irrigation based on the induced variations of soil hydrology on reducing irrigation water amount irrigation scheduling and improving wp under different rainfall conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 study area cultivation and irrigation data the study was conducted in the bajgah area school of agriculture shiraz university fars province iran 29 36 n 52 32 e with 1810 msl fig 1 the area is semi arid with a long term annual average rainfall of 386 mm ahmadi et al 2018 table 1 shows the soil s physical properties based on a comprehensive soil physicochemical study solhi 1988 the whole study area has a deep and uniform soil texture with free drainage as described in table 1 in total there are 28 fields in the study area as shown in fig 1 the area of each field is presented in supplementary table 1 the details on cultivation practice irrigation management and scheduling and harvested winter wheat gy in each field from 2012 to 2013 until 2017 2018 growing seasons were obtained from the farm management section of the school of agriculture however due to limited groundwater resources in the region and fallow practice around 8 10 fields were sown each year out of the 28 fields the details of the cultivated fields in each growing season are presented in supplementary table 2 the corresponding harvested gy of each field in each growing season is provided in supplementary table 2 the pishtaz wheat cultivar was grown in all growing seasons as it was the recommended cultivar spii 2015 during the studied growing seasons and depending on the climatic conditions previous field harvest and machinery availability the wheat seeds were mainly sown in november at a rate of 200 250 kg seeds ha 1 the wheat crops were harvested between 14 and 25 june as a local practice the urea 46 n no3 was applied at the rate of 300 kg ha 1 in two broadcasting events after sowing and the beginning of the jointing stage table 2 the irrigation method was border irrigation wheat fields were irrigated six times during the growing seasons details of the irrigation management and scheduling are shown in table 2 2 2 aquacrop model description aquacrop is a water driven model used to simulate daily crop growth steduto et al 2009 it is a simple model and requires a small number of soil and crop parameters which are divided into conservative and non conservative parameters raes et al 2012 the conservative crop parameters are not affected by time location and management and can be used with no or just minor adjustments in simulations however the non conservative parameters change due to the local conditions and crop phenology however the non conservative parameters are not generally calibrated but are obtained from the local information montoya et al 2016 davarpanah and ahmadi 2021 the aquacrop model simulates the yield and biomass of various field and horticultural crops under different environmental field and irrigation managements on a daily time scale in fact the major factors that distinguish aquacrop from the other crop models are its emphasis on crop water use incorporating canopy cover instead of leaf area index and separation of evapotranspiration into soil evaporation and plant transpiration steduto et al 2009 ahmadi et al 2015 therefore accurate simulation of cc is central for precise gy and biomass simulation nyakudya and stroosnijder 2014 vanuytrecht et al 2014 however cc is not frequently measured in field experiments and leaf area index lai is measured as a surrogate for crop growth development since neither cc nor lai was measured during the studied growing seasons we used the remotely sensed lai calculated using the historical images of the landsat 8 oli satellite over the study area for comparison of the simulated cc values by the aquacrop with the remotely sensed based cc of the farms pollock and kanemasu 1979 in this regard several studies have confirmed the robustness and usefulness of the application of the in season remotely sensed lai in the calibration and validation of crop models for yield simulation huang et al 2015 dong et al 2016 xie et al 2017 dhakar et al 2021 the remote sensing images of landsat 8 oli were downloaded from the https earthexplorer usgs gov the acquired images were from march to june for each growing season that included the main growth stages of winter wheat in the region i e jointing booting flowering grain filling and senescence table 2 the dates of downloaded images for each growing season are summarized in supplementary table 3 although the landsat 8 oli images acquisition period is generally 16 days the study area was visible in three different landsat satellite paths and rows over the study area in 7 9 days frequency i e path 162 row 39 path 162 row 40 path 163 row 39 this helped remarkably for higher temporal resolution of lai and cc assessment the image processing to calculate lai was done in the envi software version 5 3 1 fig 2 the remotely sensed lai was converted to cc based on the empirical equation reported for wheat by nielsen et al 2012 which is particularly recommended for use in the aquacrop model as 1 cc 94 00 1 exp 0 43 l a i 0 52 in this equation cc is canopy cover in and lai is leaf area index obtained from landsat images in m2 m 2 water productivity wp kg m 3 was calculated by the following equation 2 wp gy r i where gy is the harvested gy at the end of the growing season in kg r and i are the total amount of rainfall and irrigation water during the growing season in m3 respectively 2 3 calibration and validation of aquacrop so far the aquacrop has not been calibrated and validated in the study area for wheat crops the latest version of the aquacrop model version 6 1 was calibrated and validated based on gy and cc most of the crop models are generally calibrated and validated based on short period field experiments on small plots however in this study the aquacrop model was calibrated and validated over large winter wheat cultivated area and therefore we used relatively long term historical data six consecutive growing seasons of crop growth remotely sensed data and gy field measured data to cover variations of climatic conditions in calibration and validation this approach would represent the real environmental conditions in calibration and validation and makes the calibrated model a stronger and more reliable tool for improved decision making in this regard the model was calibrated for 2012 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 2017 and then was validated for 2013 2014 2015 2016 and 2017 2018 growing seasons every other year was chosen for calibration and validation during the six growing seasons to prevent systematic impacts on modeling inputs and outputs the cumulative rainfall reference evapotranspiration eto and average air temperature for the calibration and validation growing seasons are shown in fig 3 a fig 4 a and fig 4b respectively the weather data was collected from the meteorological station located within field 12 fig 1 the eto was calculated based on the modified penman monteith equation for the study area razzaghi sepaskhah 2012 the measured gy of each cultivated field in each growing season was used for calibration and validation supplementary table 2 due to variations of cc and gy in different fields the standard deviation sd of cc and gy data in each growing season was used to define a statistically significant domain for accurate and reliable simulations the sd is a statistical measure for the dispersion of a dataset from its average consequently the simulated values that fall within the sd of the measured data are a reliable way to validate the accuracy and robustness of the calibration and validation ginoux et al 2004 chiti et al 2010 montoya et al 2016 the aquacrop model was calibrated by trial and error for adjusting the crop parameters such that the simulated cc and gy matched closely to the average of the gy measurements and the remotely sensed cc in the cultivated fields in each growing season supplementary table 2 table 3 shows the calibrated parameters for the winter wheat in the study area otherwise the default model values were used 2 4 statistical indices normalized root mean square error nrmse and residual coefficient error crm was used to evaluate the goodness of calibration and validation which was estimated by the following equations 3 nrmse 1 σ i 1 n o i p i 2 n 4 crm i 1 n o i i 1 n p i i 1 n o i where nrmse is the normalized root mean square error crm is the residual coefficient error oi and pi are observed and predicted values respectively n is the number of observations and σ is the average of observation values nrmse shows the amount of error between observed and predicted values in that case nrmse 0 1 represents the excellent prediction 0 1 nrmse 0 2 represents good performance 0 2 nrmse 0 3 represents fair prediction nrmse 0 3 is poor prediction also crm value indicates the overestimation or underestimation of the prediction compared with observation so approaching crm value to zero represents the fitness of prediction 2 5 growing seasons for irrigation scenario analyses five winter wheat growing seasons including 2003 2004 2007 2008 2009 2010 2010 2011 and 2018 2019 were selected to assess winter wheat growth in different rainfall amounts and distribution the cumulative rainfall eto and average air temperature during the five selected growing seasons are shown in fig 3b fig 4c fig 4d as shown in fig 3b 2003 2004 was a wet growing season with 586 mm rainfall and 2007 2008 was a dry growing season with 127 mm rainfall additionally there are three different normal growing seasons in terms of rainfall distribution such that 2009 2010 is a wet autumn 49 rainfall during autumn with 286 mm rainfall 2010 2011 is a wet winter 89 rainfall during winter with 263 mm rainfall and 2018 2019 is a wet spring 37 rainfall during spring with 372 mm 2 6 deficit irrigation strategies on surface irrigation three deficit irrigation strategies as explained below were used to investigate the wheat crop response to water stress in the five selected growing seasons for irrigation scenario analyses each deficit irrigation strategy includes different irrigation scenarios fig 5 shows the procedure of crop modeling and details of three deficit irrigation strategies in this study none of the deficit irrigation strategies was applied in the first irrigation in the germination stage 1 dap table 2 due to the sensitivity of the wheat seeds in the germination stage 2 6 1 conventional deficit irrigation cdi in this strategy different di scenarios were considered such that a fixed deficit irrigation level was applied on the five in season irrigation events i e jointing booting flowering grain filling and senescence stages table 2 the seven deficit irrigation levels started with 10 deficit irrigation and increased by 10 to 70 the goal of this strategy was to simulate crop growth and yield under mild 10 cdi to severe water 70 cdi stress imposed during the whole growing season after jointing table 2 for example under 10 cdi irrigation depth in any of the five irrigation events will be 90 mm and in total 50 mm will be saved over the five irrigation events likewise under 70 cdi irrigation depth will be 30 mm in each irrigation event and in total 350 mm will be saved 2 6 2 single regulated deficit irrigation srdi this strategy was aimed to assess the crop growth responses to deficit irrigation in a single irrigation event or single growth stage table 2 this strategy will show the most sensitive crop growth stage s that deficit irrigation may suppress crop growth therefore deficit irrigation was imposed separately on any irrigation event i e each growth stage seven levels of deficit irrigation in each growth stage were applied from 10 to 70 with 10 intervals 2 6 3 dual regulated deficit irrigation drdi preliminary modeling output based on the traditional irrigation management of 620 mm in the study area table 2 showed that drainage happened during the jointing and or booting growth stages in all growing seasons for irrigation scenario analysis except the dry growing season of 2007 2008 fig 3 this drainage could result from spring rainfall events that coincided with the irrigation events in the booting and jointing table 2 fig 3 therefore it implied that reducing irrigation amount in these two crop growth stages is possible hence in the drdi strategy two approaches were followed in one approach deficit irrigation was applied in the jointing and booting stages rdij b therefore imposed deficit irrigation on the jointing and booting stages was a combination of 10 to 70 deficit irrigation with 10 intervals in the second approach due to uncertainty in the water supply in late growing seasons crops may be subjected to terminal drought i e drought during grain filling that is the most devastating environmental stress in wheat production habuš jerčić et al 2018 moreover it is well known that high temperatures fig 4 during the terminal drought would cause heat stress which may result in simultaneous heat and water stresses therefore being aware and knowing that combined heat and water stress decreases gy severely fahad et al 2017 luan and vico 2021 solaraju murali et al 2021 we aimed to investigate the effect of terminal drought in different growing seasons for irrigation scenarios analyses thus rdij gf imposed deficit irrigation in the jointing and grain filling stages was a combination of 10 to 70 deficit irrigation with 10 intervals 2 7 sprinkler irrigation scheduling in simulating crop growth and yield under sprinkler irrigation aquacrop can only consider a fraction of total applied water gross irrigation depth that reaches the soil surface net irrigation depth in arid and semi arid areas wind drift and evaporation losses may account for a significant fraction of the total applied water that does not reach the soil surface between 5 and 40 naderi et al 2018 maroufpoor et al 2018 maroufpoor et al 2019 in these situations the calculation of wp based on only net irrigation depth may cause an overestimation in wp indeed the calculation of wp in sprinkler irrigation has to be based on gross irrigation depth total applied water emitted from the sprinkler nozzles therefore gross irrigation depth is needed to estimate wp under sprinkler irrigation thus the gross irrigation depth for calculating wp in sprinkler irrigation was estimated by net irrigation depth and irrigation efficiency as eq 5 5 gross irrigation depth m m net irrigation depth m m irrigation efficiency two sprinkler irrigation efficiencies of 60 as the current sprinkler irrigation efficiency in the region abbasi et al 2017 and 75 as the theoretical sprinkler irrigation efficiency irmak et al 2011 rai et al 2017 were considered to estimate the gross irrigation depth in sprinkler irrigation in addition to develop new sprinkler irrigation strategies different net irrigation scenarios were adapted that are illustrated in fig 5 the details of all sprinkler irrigation strategies and scenarios are shown in table 4 net irrigation depth in eq 5 is based on the irrigation depth values in table 4 which are calculated according to the following sprinkler irrigation strategies it is noticeable that each sprinkler irrigation strategy may include different sprinkler irrigation scenarios regarding the approach of the strategy table 4 2 7 1 traditional based sprinkler irrigation strategy tra and tra the surface irrigation depth in table 2 was converted to the net irrigation depth in sprinkler irrigation table 4 according to the reported surface irrigation efficiencies in the study region as 45 tra and 55 trb abbasi et al 2017 the irrigation depth in surface irrigation scheduling i e 100 mm table 2 was converted to the net irrigation depth in sprinkler irrigation i e 45 mm and 55 mm respectively table 4 then the gross irrigation depth total applied water in sprinkler irrigation was calculated by sprinkler irrigation efficiencies i e 60 and 75 based on eq 5 it should be noted that the irrigation in the germination stage 1 dap table 2 was remained constant 120 mm table 2 due to reducing the risk of water stress in the germination especially in dry growing seasons 2 7 2 rotational based sprinkler irrigation strategy ro in this strategy sprinkler irrigation was scheduled based on the experimental approach of mehrabi and sepaskhah 2018 this study has made an irrigation scheduling for winter wheat in the study area for two growing seasons by measuring soil water deficit and then increasing soil water content to field capacity due to the different climatic conditions in different growing seasons regarding rainfall amount and distribution some irrigation depths in the mehrabi and sepaskhah 2018 study did not increase soil water content to field capacity in some growing seasons therefore in some irrigation events the soil water content reached field capacity by increasing irrigation depth manually in the model table 4 2 7 3 constraint based sprinkler irrigation strategy cb in this strategy four constraints were considered to determine the depth and the date of irrigation events in each growing season as i considering at least 10 day irrigation frequency due to decrease the risks of crops fungal diseases induced by high humidity ii between 1 and 200 dap no water stress should occur such as canopy expansion stress in vegetative growth stomatal closure and early senescence stresses in reproductive growth as defined in aquacrop model iii setting an irrigation event at the beginning of the flowering stage to ensure no water stress during this stage iv increasing soil water content to field capacity in each irrigation event these constraints are recommended by the local experts and the farm management section 2 7 4 conditional rotational based sprinkler irrigation strategy cr the relationship between gy and irrigation amount in all deficit irrigation scenarios will be explained in section 3 5 showed that the total irrigation water 620 mm table 2 could be reduced by 150 mm without gy loss i e 470 mm total net irrigation depth in this strategy 120 mm of irrigation was considered for germination 1 dap and the rest of the irrigation amount 470 120 350 was applied in five irrigation events equally such that no drainage happened 70 mm in each irrigation event table 4 however the date of irrigation events in each growing season was determined based on simulated soil water content by the aquacrop such that when the soil water content was depleted to 65 of the total available water psto upper 0 65 as the upper threshold for stomatal closure table 3 an irrigation event was applied to avoid water stress on stomatal opening in this strategy an irrigation event was set based on the depleted soil water content therefore due to the diverse rainfall amounts in different growing seasons there was no fixed number of irrigation events or fixed irrigation events in a specific growth period in addition due to the high rainfall amounts during the spring of 2018 2019 five irrigation events were sufficient to prevent water stress on stomatal opening during the growing season which means 400 mm of net irrigation was enough table 4 2 7 5 water saving based sprinkler irrigation strategy ws this strategy which is a novel irrigation scheduling approach for sprinkler irrigation in the study area was mainly developed based on the results of the deficit irrigation scenarios section 2 6 in this approach the most proper deficit irrigation scenarios which improved wp with slight gy reduction were considered based on the results of all deficit irrigation scenarios on wp reducing the total irrigation from 620 mm to 420 mm would increase wp with a minor gy loss therefore 200 mm could be saved 120 mm out of 420 mm was applied in the germination stage then in total 60 mm out of 300 mm was applied during the jointing and booting stage based on the results of drdij b i e 70 deficit irrigation section 2 6 3 and the rest of 240 mm were equally distributed in the remaining growth stages on flowering grain filling and senescence stages table 4 and table 2 3 results 3 1 aquacrop calibration and validation fig 6 shows the remotely sensed and simulated cc by aquacrop in the calibration and validation in the calibration aquacrop showed excellent performance in cc simulation in the middle of the growing season between 130 and 190 dap when cc was maximum a minor overestimation appeared in the cc simulation after 190 dap with decreasing cc at the beginning of the senescence stage table 2 although the cc simulation in the late growing season was not so accurate as in the middle of the growing seasons the model correctly simulated the decreasing trend of cc fig 6 fig 6 also shows the remotely sensed and simulated cc in the validation the simulation of cc in the validation was very accurate in the middle of all growing seasons 130 190 dap except in 2017 2018 in which the remotely sensed cc between 176 and 185 dap increased sharply however the model could not follow the increase in the cc pattern fig 7 shows the simulated and measured gy in calibration and validation slight overestimation was found in the aquacrop simulations low nrmse and crm values indicate that aquacrop simulated winter wheat gy precisely the model slightly underestimated gy in the validation though the nrmse and crm values indicate excellent model simulations however the simulations in the calibration and validation were fully in the domain of sd which means that the simulations were well in the range of observed gy values of 8 10 fields supplementary table 2 3 2 simulations of soil hydrology processes in the growing seasons for irrigation scenarios under the traditional surface irrigation management table 2 the calibrated and validated aquacrop was used to simulate the winter wheat growth and gy in five different and non consecutive growing seasons with diverse climatic conditions table 5 the simulated daily soil hydrology and the soil water content variations in the growing seasons for irrigation scenario analyses are illustrated in fig 8 the simulated gy in the five selected growing seasons varied between 5 986 and 7 029 mg ha 1 the lowest and the highest simulated gy productions were in 2004 2005 and 2009 2010 respectively additionally in the five growing seasons wp and drainage varied between 0 5 and 0 84 kg m 3 and 13 and 479 mm respectively the wet growing season 2004 2005 showed the lowest wp due to the highest rainfall amount and consequently the highest drainage while the highest wp was in the dry growing season 2007 2008 due to the lowest rainfall amount and lowest drainage table 5 in fig 8 in wet and normal growing seasons high amounts of drainage in different crop stages show over irrigation which causes excess drainage therefore reducing irrigation depth or deficit irrigation can reduce drainage and improve wp 3 3 simulation of gy and wp under deficit irrigation 3 3 1 conventional deficit irrigation cdi fig 9 shows simulated wp and gy of winter wheat under 10 to 70 cdi wp showed different responses to cdi in different growing seasons due to diverse rainfall conditions fig 3b in 2018 2019 wp had a constantly increasing trend and cdi 70 increased wp by 48 compared to those wp under the traditional irrigation management table 5 due to the high rainfall in the spring and no gy reduction fig 3b in 2004 2005 10 to 60 of cdi did not affect wp considerably and cdi 70 decreased wp by 18 in 2009 2010 and 2010 2011 the highest wp was observed in cdi 50 which increased wp by 23 and 27 respectively in contrast in 2007 2008 10 to 70 of cdi decreased wp from 0 84 kg m 3 to 0 21 kg m 3 due to low rainfall and low soil water content fig 3b and fig 8 due to the strategic and economic importance of the winter wheat high gy reduction caused by deficit irrigation may not be acceptable by farmers and public organizations thus gy production under all cdi scenarios was investigated in detail fig 9b shows winter wheat gy under different levels of cdi in five growing seasons in 2007 2008 gy decreased sharply under cdi due to low rainfall and severe water stress fig 3b alternatively 10 to 40 of cdi did not decrease gy significantly in normal and wet growing seasons in 2018 2019 cdi did not affect gy due to high rainfall during spring fig 3b this shows the significance of spring rainfall for maintaining winter wheat gy under different levels of conventional deficit irrigation 3 3 2 single regulated deficit irrigation srdi different levels of deficit irrigation were imposed on any irrigation event or growth stage except the first irrigation germination stage table 2 as srdi the wp and gy under srdi simulations for the selected growing seasons are shown in fig 10 a and fig 10b respectively the effect of 10 to 70 deficit irrigation on the wp and gy of each growth stage is shown as the mean sd to summarize the results of 175 simulated scenarios in this section as shown in fig 10 srdi improved wp in comparison with table 5 with no gy reduction in any growth stages for all growing seasons except 2007 2008 the srdi increased wp between null to 9 in different growing seasons the highest increment of wp was observed in 2010 2011 wet winter and the lowest was in 2007 2008 dry in 2007 2008 srdi in different growth stages positively affected wp while suppressed gy production the highest gy reduction was attributed to 2007 2008 in which 70 of srdi in the jointing stage decreased gy by 10 compared to the gy under traditional irrigation management table 5 fig 10 fig 10 indicates that 10 to 70 deficit irrigation in winter wheat growth stages table 2 improved wp with no remarkable gy reduction in the wet and normal growing seasons in contrast significant gy reduction was observed under srdi in jointing and booting stages in the dry growing season this reveals that proper irrigation management under jointing and booting stages is important for sustainable crop production 3 3 3 dual regulated deficit irrigation strategy drdi simulations showed high amounts of drainage occurred during the jointing and booting stages of winter wheat in normal and wet growing seasons under the traditional irrigation management fig 8 and table 5 thus deficit irrigation was imposed in the jointing and booting stages rdij b and jointing and grain filling stages rdij gf to increase wp fig 11 shows the simulated gy and wp of winter wheat under rdi scenarios in different growing seasons the specific rdi scenario which resulted in the highest wp in each growing season has been mentioned beside each box in fig 11 in general in comparison with table 5 rdij b increased wp between null 2007 2008 and 20 2010 2011 in all five growing seasons fig 11b reducing 70 of irrigation depth in both jointing and booting stages increased wp with minor or null gy reduction in all growing seasons except 2007 2008 fig 11b and d as shown in the 3 3 2 section rdij b had a suppressing effect on gy in 2007 2008 rdij b scenarios reduced gy between 2 and 20 in 2007 2008 however in 2007 2008 wp slightly increased under 10 and 30 of di in the jointing and booting stages j10 b30 respectively therefore based on the simulations rdij b could be applied in normal and wet growing seasons to increase wp with sustainable crop production moreover winter wheat gy and wp was also simulated under deficit irrigation in jointing and grain filling stages rdij gf to assess the impact of terminal drought on the crop fig 11a and b results showed that rdij gf did not affect gy in normal and wet growing seasons based on the simulations in fig 11a rdij gf increased wp between null 2007 2008 and 19 2010 2011 in all five growing seasons the gy reduction was observed only in 2007 2008 in which gy decreased between null and 17 under different levels of rdij gf fig 11b therefore reducing 70 of irrigation depth in the jointing and grain filling stages resulted in increasing wp with no gy reduction in all growing seasons except 2007 2008 in contrast rdij gf reduced gy remarkably in 2007 2008 3 4 relationship between grain yield production deficit irrigation and water productivity fig 12 shows the simulation of winter wheat wp and gy under all cdi srdi and drdi scenarios against irrigation water depth each point in fig 12 represents the gy or wp of any single deficit irrigation scenario under cdi srdi and drdi strategies in all growing seasons except 2007 2008 irrigation depth higher than 470 mm did not contribute to crop production fig 12b in addition reducing irrigation depth to 470 mm increased wp by 18 compared to traditional irrigation management table 5 in 2009 2010 2010 2011 and 2018 2019 10 in 2004 2005 and did not affect wp in 2007 2008 furthermore in fig 12a 420 mm of irrigation increased wp by 24 compared to table 5 in 2009 2010 and 2018 2019 22 in 2010 2011 12 in 2004 2005 and 6 in 2007 2008 overall irrigation depth below 420 mm in all growing seasons except the wet spring reduced gy compared to the threshold gy production simulated under 420 mm fig 12b 3 5 adaptive and non adaptive irrigation managements in the previous section we assumed that deficit irrigation practices are adaptive such that farm managers can manage the irrigation under different climatic conditions without any restriction of water resources however due to several uncertainties in rainfall events and water supply such as break down or failure of the pumping systems regulation in groundwater extraction water laws the crops would likely be experiencing different levels of unexpected and unregulated water stress during the main growth stages table 2 to address this uncertainty in gy and wp simulation we defined a series of non adaptive combined deficit irrigation scenarios that may likely happen during the wheat growth supplementary tables 4 and 5 summarize the non adaptive irrigation management scenarios and the simulated gy and wp respectively we considered different combinations of specific deficit irrigation levels during the jointing to senescence growth stages supplementary table 5 shows the recommended scenarios bold numbers in each growing season based on the highest simulated wp and the relative grain yield rgy compared to the traditional surface irrigation scheduling table 2 and table 5 the results showed that different non adaptive deficit irrigation scenarios improved wp with minor or no gy reduction in all five growing seasons even in the dry year in all growing seasons wp varied between 0 14 kg m 3 and 1 kg m 3 obtained in 2004 2005 and 2009 2010 respectively furthermore the results showed that all non adaptive scenarios increased wp in 2009 2010 wet autumn and 2018 2019 wet spring although their rgy varied between 60 96 and 100 generally these scenarios provide a beneficial tool in crop production management to improve wp and water management in drought conditions where water supply is limited 3 6 simulating water productivity and grain yield under sprinkler irrigation in all sprinkler irrigation scenarios table 4 the net irrigation depth varied between 345 mm and 880 mm the wide range of irrigation depth in sprinkler scenarios indicates that these scenarios were provided considering different rainfall conditions table 6 shows the simulation of winter wheat wp and rgy under different sprinkler irrigation scenarios with 60 and 75 application efficiency in five growing seasons we compared wp and gy under sprinkler scenarios and traditional surface irrigation management thus in table 6 wp values higher than those in table 5 are shown in bold also rgy relative grain yield values greater or equal to 95 are shown in bold the wp and rgy varied between 0 38 kg ha 1 to 0 87 kg ha 1 and 43 to 108 respectively the impact of sprinkler irrigation on wp varied between 55 and 32 compared with table 5 the highest wp was in 2018 2019 under ro strategy with 75 of sprinkler irrigation application efficiency in contrast the lowest wp was in 2007 2008 under tra strategy with 60 of sprinkler irrigation application efficiency the results clearly showed that 60 of sprinkler irrigation application efficiency decreased wp under all sprinkler irrigation scenarios mainly except in 2018 2019 compared to those under the traditional surface irrigation management table 5 in 2004 2005 with low spring rainfall fig 3b all sprinkler irrigation scenarios had a negative or marginal positive impact on wp also all sprinkler irrigation scenarios reduced wp in 2007 2008 due to a dry year fig 3b alternatively all sprinkler irrigation scenarios with 75 sprinkler irrigation application efficiency increased wp in 2018 2019 with wet spring fig 3b with 75 of application efficiency ws and cb strategies increased wp in all growing seasons except the dry year 2007 2008 under ro and cb strategies rgys were higher or equal to 95 but the corresponding wps were lower than those obtained under the traditional surface irrigation management except in 2018 2019 table 5 furthermore cr and ws strategies showed good gy and wp improvement only in normal and wet growing seasons rgy 96 generally based on table 6 cr and ws strategies which were developed based on the deficit irrigation scenarios section 2 6 improved wp and gy compared to the other sprinkler irrigation strategies 4 discussion 4 1 aquacrop simulation and assessment fig 6 and fig 7 show that aquacrop accurately simulates winter wheat cc and gy in fig 6 the overestimation in the simulation of cc in the late calibration growing seasons could be attributed to neglecting the effect of high temperature on cc by the aquacrop model andarzian et al 2011 xiangxiang et al 2013 trombetta et al 2016 han et al 2020 in fact other researchers have also indicated the overestimation of cc by aquacrop during the late season and senescence ahmadi et al 2015 the overestimation of aquacrop in simulation cc in the late growing season would also affect the final gy simulation because aquacrop estimates gy through cc steduto et al 2009 raes et al 2009 however the nrmse values in fig 7 show that the model could precisely estimate wheat gy during the six consecutive growing seasons accurate simulations of gy in calibration and validation fig 7 clearly demonstrate that using aquacrop in those regions that there are no previous historical reports or observations of crop growth data cc calculation according to the remotely sensed based lai is an accurate reliable and low cost method in simulating winter wheat cc and gy other studies have also shown that using crop remotely sensed growth data in aquacrop is a precise and straightforward method to simulate different crops growth including wheat maize alfalfa barley and tomato trombetta et al 2016 kim and kaluarachchi 2015 marta et al 2019 corbari et al 2021 other studies have also shown that using remotely sensed data in aquacrop modeling helped estimate crop water requirement marta et al 2019 and irrigation scheduling corbari et al 2021 therefore the results imply that aquacrop is a robust crop growth model in optimizing irrigation scheduling and evaluating crop response to different irrigation managements and scenarios under different climatic conditions garcía vila et al 2009 geerts et al 2010 4 2 deficit irrigation based on the results of cdi scenarios fig 9 reducing irrigation water to 470 mm 30 cdi increases wp with no significant gy reduction except in dry growing seasons in this context other studies confirmed our results and proposed cdi to improve wp fereres and soriano 2007 farré and faci 2009 davarpanah and ahmadi 2021 investigated the irrigation scheduling of wheat in a hot and warm climate in the southwest of iran where its climate is greatly different from our study area they reported that imposing cdi 40 increases wp and imposing higher levels of cdi would decrease wp and gy sharply especially in dry growing seasons zhao et al 2020 recommended imposing mild water stress 40 to increase wheat wp and water use efficiency with minor gy reduction however in our study the cdi 30 is the recommended irrigation management in normal and wet growing seasons to improve wp with no gy reduction fig 9 the results of srdi and rdij b show that the jointing and booting are the most sensitive stages versus water stress respectively table 2 fig 10 and fig 11b however fig 10 shows that imposing any level of srdi on any growth stage increases wp and does not affect gy in normal and wet growing seasons it seems rainfall during jointing and booting stages in normal and wet growing seasons prevents crop water stress fig 3b fig 8 fig 10 and fig 11b our study confirms the previous study in this area which revealed that water stress during the jointing stage reduces gy remarkably mehrabi and sepaskhah 2019 many studies have also confirmed that water stress in jointing and booting stages of wheat decreased gy and wp hochman 1982 gupta et al 2001 xiangxiang et al 2013 liu et al 2016 the srdi and rdij b indicate that although imposing deficit irrigation during the jointing and booting stages in low rainfall conditions does not reduce wp it would severely cause gy reduction this shows the high interaction of irrigation water and rainfall on sustaining wheat gy in the study area the effect of rdij gf in the jointing and grain filling stages of winter wheat on gy and wp was investigated to assess the impact of terminal drought fig 11 the results show that terminal drought reduces gy and wp only in dry growing seasons no gy reduction was observed in normal and wet growing seasons and rdij gf increased wp in this context regarding the high temperature in the late growing seasons fig 4d the crop may be under heat stress rdij gf imposes water stress during the jointing and grain filling the late growing season stages table 2 therefore under rdij gf scenarios crops may simultaneously face heat and water stress in the late growing season many studies reported that combined heat and water stress had a devastating multiplicative effect on gy reduction barnabás et al 2008 fahad et al 2017 luan and vico 2021 solaraju murali et al 2021 aquacrop does not consider heat stress in the late growing season andarzian et al 2011 trombetta et al 2016 han et al 2020 thus the model may not accurately simulate crop growth under rdij gb scenarios it seems aquacrop is weak in the simulation of crop growth and consequently soil hydrology processes under terminal drought it is recommended that future versions of the model would include the effect of heat stress on the whole water relations of plants and soil in the aquacrop generally results of crop response to deficit irrigation managements show that a properly managed deficit irrigation practice cdi srdi drdi could be applied in winter wheat fields as a water saving irrigation strategy to increase wp and conserve water resources results of cdi fig 9 srdi fig 10 rdij b fig 11 and simulated drainage in different growing seasons table 5 and fig 8 show that the traditional surface irrigation management in the study area table 2 is basically suitable and applicable mostly for low rainfall conditions or dry growing seasons thus applying the traditional irrigation scheduling table 2 would cause much water loss through drainage in normal and wet growing seasons table 5 and fig 8 figs 9 10 and 11 show that rainfall amount and distribution are critical factors in designing a proper and dynamic climate based irrigation scheduling and selecting the most productive deficit irrigation strategy in the study area therefore in such areas with erratic rainfall events fig 3b irrigation scheduling based on the rainfall condition of each growing season would lead to higher wp improved achievement in saving water in wet growing seasons and sustainable crop production in dry growing seasons in our study the relationship between gy production and deficit irrigation shows irrigation water requirement varies between 270 and 620 mm in different growing seasons depending on the rainfall condition fig 8 also non adaptive scenarios were provided and simulated by aquacrop to guide farmers in managing unexpected water stress therefore aquacrop could serve powerful modeling and decision making tool to guide farmers in selecting proper irrigation management and planning based on water supply climatic and rainfall conditions under climate change therefore enhancing the climate resilience of irrigated agriculture such as irrigation management and irrigation method sprinkler irrigation is required to improve water use management and crop production hedley et al 2014 ward 2022 4 3 sprinkler irrigation scheduling based on the results of our simulations table 6 sprinkler irrigation in the dry growing season of 2007 2008 mostly decreased wp and gy in general since under low rainfall conditions crop water requirement is solely dependent on irrigation therefore crop water requirement shall be supplied through the sprinkler irrigation system which implies more frequent irrigation events and higher irrigation depth per irrigation event table 4 this will certainly increase more water loss wind drift or evaporation through a higher number of irrigation events in dry years than wet years when part of the crop water requirement is met by rainfall that indeed does not bear any losses such as wind drift or evaporation this is a very critical point in sprinkler irrigation system management under dry conditions to adapt irrigation schedulings such as over night irrigation or by improvement in designing the systems such as the layout of the laterals and sprinklers that reduce the risk of water loss zareabyaneh et al 2019 therefore wp and or gy of wheat under sprinkler irrigation in dry climates could potentially be improved by appropriate system management and design to increase soil water content in the root zone without drainage fig 8 this concern has also been recently argued by bjorneberg et al 2020 that in order to increase irrigation efficicny in changing furrow irrigation to sprinkler irrigation in an arid region irrigation scheduling should be based on soil moisture measurement or daily et to match crop water requirement on individual fields therfeore any amount of irrigation water that is lost due to higher evaporation wind drift and losses through deep percolation bjorneberg et al 2020 faryabi et al 2020 during the growing season will consequently not contribute to gy production thus increasing the gross irrigation amount does not necessarily result in a higher gy in general it is believed that sprinkler irrigation would increase wp in the arid and semi arid areas by saving more water ghadami firouzabadi et al 2020 bjorneberg et al 2020 however our analysis and results showed that higher wp under sprinkler irrigation could not always be achieved other researchers reported similar findings in agreement with our results maroufpoor et al 2019 abbasi et al 2017 moulaee et al 2016 skhiri and dechmi 2012 fard et al 2020 showed decreasing wp and gy under sprinkler irrigation compared with flood irrigation seyedan et al 2018 investigated wheat wp and gy under sprinkler and surface irrigation and showed that although sprinkler irrigation increased wp it caused remarkable gy reduction thus it is clear that high wp under sprinkler irrigation could be achieved through proper sprinkler irrigation management and strategy based on climatic conditions therefore rainfall amount and its distribution along the growing season should be considered in sprinkler irrigation management for proper water allocation to increase gy and wp in this regard liu and song 2020 argued that irrigation systems are developed and invested but the potential wp is not achieved yet due to poor relevance knowledge of irrigation systems operators our study shows that although sprinkler irrigation increases wp in normal and wet growing seasons it is not a productive irrigation method in drought conditions furthermore more frequent mild to severe drought events in the future dai 2013 vaghefi et al 2019 may limit the usage of sprinkler irrigation systems in arid and semi arid areas based on the results of our study moreover in such areas with highly erratic and uncertain annual rainfalls irrigation strategies must be synchronized according to the rainfall characteristics amount and distribution and soil water content during the growing season in order to increase wp and sustainable gy production supplementary table 5 and supplementary table 6 can help farmers managers water allocators and stakeholders to select and design the proper irrigation scheduling synchronized based on the climatic condition of the growing season weather and rainfall forecast technologies may help in advance for real time irrigation scheduling rao et al 1992 wang and cai 2009 cai et al 2011 lorite et al 2015 specific system design management and operation of sprinkler systems are essential to increase the application efficiency under dry conditions to improve wp and water resources conservation bjorneberg et al 2020 faryabi et al 2020 5 conclusion in this study the water driven aquacrop model was calibrated and validated to simulate winter wheat growth and gy under the surface irrigation scheduling in different growing seasons due to the lack of historical crop growth data remotely sensed lai provided crop growth data in calibration and validation then the calibrated and validated aquacrop model was used to simulate wheat growth and gy in five different growing seasons under different irrigation scenarios to investigate the effect of deficit irrigation on gy and wp the results showed that remotely sensed crop growth data are helpful in the calibration and validation of the aquacrop model aquacrop simulation of winter wheat growth in the five growing seasons showed that the traditional surface irrigation management is based on low rainfall conditions to avoid gy loss induced by water stress therefore it caused a remarkable water loss in normal and wet growing seasons also simulated winter wheat growth and gy under different deficit irrigation scenarios showed that reducing irrigation depth by 150 mm can improve wp with no gy reduction in normal and wet growing seasons in such climates with erratic rainfall fixed irrigation management would result in high water loss in normal and wet growing seasons therefore deficit irrigation could be applied to save water in normal and wet years as a result flexible irrigation scheduling is recommended to conserve water resources in normal and wet growing seasons and sustain crop production in dry growing seasons aquacrop was used to simulate wheat gy and wp under different sprinkler irrigation scheduling with different application efficiency the results indicated that sprinkler irrigation with an application efficiency of 60 decreased wp due to high water losses and irrigation water requirements based on simulations ws and cr sprinkler irrigation strategies with 75 sprinkler irrigation efficiency improved wp with no significant gy reduction only in normal and wet growing seasons alternatively sprinkler irrigation increased water requirements in dry growing seasons compared with surface irrigation scheduling and decreased wp table 2 therefore sprinkler irrigation in dry years would increase the pressure on water recourses declaration of competing

1 introduction shortage of water resources and discrepancies between supply and demand are increasingly prominent in the inland area of northwest china restricting possibilities for economic and social development in the region over recent decades population has increased rapidly leading to a sharp increase in water demand in an area with limited resources guo et al 2015a 2015b groundwater is a vital source of irrigation and drinking water in arid and semiarid regions and water withdrawals commonly exceed natural rates of renewal edmunds 2003 causing large declines in groundwater levels qiu 2010 this is the case for china in addition salinization of groundwater occurs in many areas as a result of river regulation land use change irrigation and groundwater exploitation huang and pang 2012 given the rapid economic development and increasing population in the shule river basin srb an improved understanding of the regional water cycle including moisture sources and groundwater recharge mechanisms is essential for regional planning the srb is an inland river basin located at the western end of the hexi corridor in northwest china fig 1 the shule river rises in the qilian mountains and flows through the yumen tashi sub basin to the lower gobi desert where it disappears ma et al 2005 groundwater and river water are important sources for oases in the middle and lower regions of the srb the water is used mainly for farmland irrigation near changma in the yumen tashi sub basin huahai in the huahai sub basin and shuangta in the guazhou sub basin guo et al 2015a 2015b zhao 2017 by 2020 the population had increased to 5 4 105 as a result of the migration of a large agricultural workforce to the region concurrently the area of irrigated farmland has grown to 1 3 103 km2 water resources bulletin of gansu province 2020 over pumping of groundwater for irrigation has caused the hydraulic heads in aquifers to decreased by 0 15 m a from 2000 to 2010 wang et al 2016 large scale agriculture and other human activities have also led to severe sulfate pollution and deterioration of drinking water quality through acidification and salinization who 1998 examples of high so4 2 concentrations in river water average 199 mg l and shallow groundwater average 383 mg l are documented in the heihe river basin hrb adjacent to the study area li et al 2013a 2013b moreover the disparity between high evaporation rates and low precipitation has caused water resource shortage and degradation therefore understanding the sources and quality of groundwater and surface water

has been little systematic study of the origins of surface water and ages of groundwater a new dataset consisting of multiple isotope parameters δ18o δd 3h 14c and sulfate isotopes is presented table

picture of the contributions of meltwater to aquifers of the srb in addition previously published δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 of surface water and groundwater from the neighboring hrb li et al 2013a 2013b are compared with similar data for the srb the major goals of the study were 1 to investigate the modern moisture sources in the headwaters of srb 2 to relate values of δ18o and δd in surface water to those in the regional ice archives 3 to improve the understanding of the origins of surface water and groundwater in the srb along with residence times of the latter 4 to investigate the role of climate change in particular changes in sources of moisture over time in generating the large ranges of δ18o and δd values in srb groundwater and surface water 5 to constrain the sources of dissolved sulfate in the srb our results will provide an improved basis for planning to prevent further degradation of the regional environment in the srb 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the srb is

sampled from available irrigation wells in active use groundwater and surface water samples were collected in glass bottles rinsed five times with the sampled water before sampling sample sites along the shule river are shown in fig 1 with detail in figs s1 and s2 a total of 80 153 and 13 representative groundwater surface water and snowpack samples respectively were obtained samples for measurement of δ18o and δd were stored in rinsed 2 ml glass storage vials sealed with parafilm beneath the lids for measurement of 14c we precipitated dissolved inorganic carbon dic from 25l samples in the field four such samples were taken at each site qi et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 samples for 3h measurement were stored in sealed 500 ml glass bottles washed at least five times before collecting 2 4 analysis of stable isotopes and radioactive isotopes values of δ18o and δd were measured using a picarro l2140 water isotope analyzer at the shaanxi key laboratory of earth surface system and environmental carrying capacity northwest university xi an china to avoid memory effects each sample was measured ten times and the first three measurements were discarded the analytical precision 1σ was better than 0 1 for δd and 0 025 for δ18o the values of δ18o and δd are calibrated using international standards vsmow and slap coplen 1995 three working standards with values given as δ18o δd

tritium samples were electrolytically enriched and then measured by low background liquid scintillation spectrometry in a quantulus 1220 instrument the detection limit was 1 0 tu carbon from dic was converted into benzene the 14c content was measured in a quantulus 1220 low background liquid scintillation spectrometer qi et al 2016 the analytical precision 1σ varied from about 1 0 pmc near 14 0

hrb zhao et al 2018 suggesting that similar factors affect the isotope data in precipitation throughout the qilian mountains many data with δ18o 2 plot to the right of the lmwl because of evaporation from falling raindrops fig 3 the lmwl of the srb from zhao 2017 has lower slope than the ur lmwl indicating secondary evaporation caused by dry conditions in the mr and lr in common with other datasets for precipitation at high altitude in the qilian mountains summer rain june september has high mean monthly values of δ18o usually 5 while rain at other times of the year has values 10 zhao et al 2011 fig 4 for 2018 amount weighted means of δ18o δd in august at suli were 12 3 79 8 which were significantly lower than those of urumqi controlled by the westerlies hong kong controlled by the east asian summer monsoon and in the srb in other years zhao 2017 fig 4 in addition the amount weighted means of δ18o were lower from july to september fig 4 consistent with the isotope pattern observed in lhasa where precipitation is controlled by the indian summer monsoon ism 3 1 2 surface water more negative values of δ18o δd of surface water were found in the ur arithmetic means 8 6 53 9

close to the lmwl and are much lower than those of shule river water collected in the same period in the ur values of δ18o and δd of laohugou ice meltwater wu et al 2016 and shiyi snow ice meltwater

pmc as expected for post bomb recharge that has dissolved some rock carbon groundwaters with 80 pmc have a wide range of tritium content from below detection to 22 tu 3 3 sulfate isotopes in surface water and groundwater values of δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 of groundwater varied from 3 2 to 12 4 and 1 8 to 15 5 with arithmetic means of 9 6 and 9 3 respectively in surface water δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 ranged from 1 0 to 11 0 and from 2 2 to 10 5 with arithmetic means of 6 1 and 5 1 respectively table s4 the arithmetic means of δ34sso4 δ18oso4 values of the groundwater were 5 6 7 6 9 3 11 4 and 10 9 8 4 in the ur mr and lr respectively mean so4 2 and no3 concentrations are 559 5 mg l and 6 8 mg l in groundwater and 323 2 mg l and 2 4 mg l in river water respectively table s2 and s3 4 discussion 4 1 usefulness of tritium and 14c data in fig 8 groundwater can be classified into three groups group 1 green area has high uncorrected 14c activity 80 pmc and represents groundwater of short residence time mainly post bomb recharge with some mixing with older water group 2 blue area has low tritium 10 tu and 14c activity 80 pmc with shallow and deep groundwater in the srb indicating recharge mainly from pre bomb precipitation group 3 yellow area is an intermediate group with uncorrected 14c values of 15 80 pmc and tritium contents above 15 tu indicating mixtures of old water and post bomb precipitation e g gw 2 in the ur 16 7 tu 16 4 pmc in the mr and lr this study like that of zhao et al 2018 shows that mixing of water of different residence times is typical mixing may occur in wells with long screens that sample water of different residence times or as a result of irrigation reflux of low pmc irrigation water mixed with post bomb rainwater at the surface tritium data are useful for identifying groundwater containing some recent recharge tritium in zhangye precipitation from 1985 assuming 35 tu see fig 5 of zhao et al 2018 will remain detectable 1 5 tu until about 2040 tritium in 2002 precipitation average 20 tu after the regional anthropogenic pulse of tritium will remain detectable until about 2050 these calculations assume no mixing between with older groundwater residence times estimated from 14c data are useful only as approximate indications for samples with tritium below detection correction of 14c data will not be attempted here because correction protocols cannot readily be applied to groundwater mixtures 4 2 moisture sources in the upper region normally both summer and winter precipitation in the qilian mountains originate as moisture transported from the west yu et al 2006 yao et al 2009 zhao et al 2011 zhao et al 2016 jiang et al 2019 the westerly circulation pattern yielded consisitent seasonal patterns of δ18o from 2013 to 2016 in srb and urumqi zhao 2017 fig 4 abnormally negative δ18o in precipitation from august 2018 and a similar trend of δ18o in lhasa in combination with wind directions revealed a strong incursion of ism moisture into the ur of the srb figs 4 and 7 at present and during the holocene the east asian summer monsoon easm appears to have extended no further west than longitude 101 e under most conditions li et al 2018 and therefore does not bring moisture to the hrb and srb on the tibetan plateau the influence of the ism at present extends to 33 34 n on the basis of isotope data in precipitation tian et al 2001 also failing to reach the hrb and srb under usual conditions a past incursion 12 ka of the ism into the qilian mountains has been suggested by zhao et al 2018 as an explanation of the isotope composition of type 3 groundwater fig 6 the monsoon moisture in august 2018 was advected around the eastern edge of the tibetan plateau and imparted a low δ18o signature to precipitation these observations strengthen the argument that past incursions of ism might explain the low values of δ18o and δd in type 3 groundwater 4 3 sources of surface water in qilian mountains the ur el intersects the ur lmwl and snow ice meltwater lines for the laohugou and shiyi at δ18o near 10 4 corresponding to a mixture of precipitation with high altitude meltwater fig 5 our results are consistent with those of zhang et al 2019 who estimated an average contribution of 23 6 of glacier meltwater to ur surface water from 1971 to 2013 the intersection for the dang river el with the ur lmwl is poorly defined but appears to be at δ18o 12 data of he 2013 ma et al 2013 while the intersection for the heihe river with the ur lmwl for that basin is at 8 1 zhao et al 2018 glacial meltwater therefore contributes a larger fraction to the dang river than to the other rivers consistent with ma et al 2013 who observed that the meltwater contributes significantly to dang river the distinctive surface water in each basin might be an artefact of sampling in different years if the mean δ18o and δd of precipitation change from year to year however groundwater commonly integrates the isotope variations of surface water over multiple years both surface water and groundwater indicate a source on the lmwl near δ18o 10 in the ur of the srb despite their similar ranges of altitude and climate each basin appears to have a distinctive source of surface water the reasons are discussed below 4 4 sources of groundwater in the middle and lower regions groundwater of the mr and lr plots within a quadrilateral three sides of which can be considered as distinctive sources of water and end members of mixing labled 1 2 and 3 in fig 6 type 1 is shule river surface water type 2 corresponds to the isotope composition of ice accumulated in the dunde ice sheet between 12 ka and 2005 ce thompson 2000 takeuchi et al 2009 and type 3 comprising a group of evaporated waters delimits the data downwards corresponding to a pre 12 ka incursion of the ism as discussed by zhao et al 2018 among the water types the following kinds of mixing occur a lr groundwater sampled in this study forms a linear trend between type 1 and older type 2 at the type 2 end of the trend are samples gw 12 and 13 groundwater associated with the tashi river the mixing is therefore between water derived from shule and tashi rivers which enter the lr separately b mr groundwater forms a poorly defined mixing trend between type 1 and younger type 2 c groundwater in the mr near the tashi river wang et al 2016 includes type 2 mixtures of type 2 with evaporated type 3 and mixtures of type 2 with unevaporated type 3 source water d lr groundwater from the dunhuang sub basin this study ma et al 2013 plots between types 2 pre 1925 dunde ice and 3 so also does most beishan groundwater wang et al 2015a 2015b e ur groundwater data coincide with the evaporation trend for ur surface water the dunde ice sheet does not lie within the srb fig 1b its importance to this study lies in providing a continuous record of isotopes in precipitation archived as ice over the last 12 ka fig 6c a record that we assume applies to all ice of similar age present or formerly present in the srb such ice is the source of type 2 water at dunde ice about 12 ka old rests on bedrock thompson 2000 earlier ice was removed suggesting a warm climatic event just prior to 12 ka earlier ice may not have been uniformly removed in neighboring parts of the qilian mountains as will be discussed below zhao et al 2018 noted that the source of type 3 water in the hrb could not be found in the dunde ice archive or in recent precipitation this study confirms the regional presence of similar water in the hexi corridor beishan and qilian mountains assuming an evaporation slope of 5 justified by measurements on present day surface water fig 5b pre evaporation values of δ18o of type 3 water on the lmwl or the dunde ice line are between 14 and 20 too low to originate from ice like that at dunde but resembling present day ism precipitation on the tibetan plateau fig 6a e g in present day surface water in southern tibet ice at noijin kangsang from 1864 to 2006 and precipitation at lhasa zhao et al 2012 international atomic energy agency 2021b incursion of the ism into the qilian mountains prior to 12 ka ago may account for type 3 water zhao et al 2018 present day snowpack and winter precipitation also overlap type 3 source water in isotope composition fig 5a and 6a wang et al 2016 suggested that present meltwater from snowpack and ice was the source of type 3 groundwater near the tashi river we propose that the origin of type 3 water is precipitation archived as ice older than 12 ka for the following reasons 1 winter precipitation at present makes up only about 20 of total precipitation in the region zhou et al 2015 2 present day surface water in main stem of the shule river did not resemble snowpack or winter precipitation in 2018 and 2020 this study or in 2011 2013 he et al 2015 under present climatic conditions the shule river does not deliver type 3 water to the mr and lr 3 bulk precipitation since 12 ka as evidenced by ice at dunde cannot provide runoff of the required composition the set of end members in fig 6a and 6b is consistent with the evolution of precipitation sources and isotopes in the qilian mountains as suggested by zhao et al 2018 prior to 12 ka at a time that cannot be specified more precisely precipitation had isotope characteristics of present day ism precipitation on the tibetan plateau in the hexi corridor region long term incursion of the ism or the easm extended north into beishan since 12 ka most moisture has been advected from the west and has evolved isotopically as shown in fig 6c the isotope composition of high altitude precipitation is unlikely to have differed across the catchments of the srb for which water isotope data exist the shule river mainstem dang and tashi rivers instead the catchments may have differed in the timing and relative amounts of contributions of end members 2 and 3 to runoff types 2 and 3 water are present in ancient groundwater dunhuang sub basin and beishan and in runoff dang river the degree of evaporation of each end member varies between sub catchments e g the type 3 component of groundwater is highly evaporated near the dang river but not in all cases near the tashi river which is shorter and steeper in gradient ice corresponding to type 3 appears to persist and contribute strongly to runoff in the dang and tashi river catchments but may be absent in the ur of the shule and heihe rivers however due to the uncertainties and limitations of the stable isotope method it is difficult to quantify the contribution of different recharge sources scanlon et al 2002 shi et al 2021 4 5 long term climate change in the srb regional and global contexts the lack of bulk δ18o values lower than 11 5 in dunde ice fig 6c thompson 2000 indicates that a strong positive shift in δ18o from 14 to 11 5 occurred in qilian mountains precipitation before 12 ka late pleistocene to early holocene shifts of this nature have been documented in many regions across the globe they are commonly ascribed to temperature change following the last ice age jasechko et al 2015 well dated isotope shifts at 10 12 ka in greenland ice johnsen et al 2001 and 13 15 ka in southwestern north america wagner et al 2010 may be compared with the pre 12 ka isotope shift in the qilian mountains where the δ18o shift is larger than elsewhere and is probably due to changing predominant wind directions zhao et al 2018 another large positive and apparently accelerating shift in δ18o of qilian mountains precipitation since the 19th century present in dunde ice fig 6c using data from takeuchi et al 2009 li et al 2015 correlates in time with climatic drying and loss of surface water in the tarim basin to the west of the srb putnam et al 2016 the present study confirms the regional extent of the pre 12 ka isotope shift in the qilian mountains and north to the beishan mountains jiang et al 2019 attempted to date isotope shifts in several arid basins of north china including the shule and heihe river basins on the basis of simple relations between δ18o δd and corrected 14c content in groundwater this study and zhao et al 2018 indicate that interpreting the timing of isotope shifts in these basins is more complicated than assumed in jiang et al 2019 recharge of ancient precipitation in the piedmont basins occurs in part after delayed melting of ice archives preserving the ancient stable isotope signatures but imparting a 14c signature younger than that of the ancient precipitation 4 6 identifying sulfate sources in fig 9 a the δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 for the srb are compared with likely sulfate sources much of the ranges of both δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 is present in the ur of the shule river where the following sources of sulfate are likely lower carboniferous marine lcm sulfate is present in a gypsum evaporite at the base of the carboniferous to triassic shelf sediments tong 2016 sulfide sources include cambrian volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits and their host rocks jiang et al 1999 and organic rich shelf sediments zuza et al 2018 that are likely sources of bacterially reduced sulfur sulfate formed by oxidation of such sulfide is likely to have a broad range of δ34sso4 and low values of δ18oso4 related to δ18o of meteoric water at the site of oxidation of sulfide van stempvoort et al 1994 regional dust sulfate represented by three gypsum nodules from the chinese loess plateau near xining and lanzhou jeong and lee 2010 is a third possible source the shule and heihe river catchments have similar geology li et al 2013a 2013b zuza et al 2018 meng et al 2020 but the δ34sso4 ranges of sulfide derived sulfate differ in the two basins and data for heihe river surface water form a linear trend that is not present in the shule river fig 9 in the srb groundwater in the ur and surface water have similar ranges of δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 forming a broad array best explained as mixing between evaporite sulfate and sulfate formed by oxidation of sulfide of wide ranging δ34sso4 the data for the mr and lr groundwater including several examples of old groundwater as defined in fig 8 plot between loess gypsum and lcm sulfate suggesting that sulfate in the mr and lr consists of mixtures of the regional dust sulfate with lcm sulfate fig 9 the mixed water type of fig 8 has a wider range of δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 than young and old water consistent with the complex mixing of sulfate in irrigation water and rainwater high sulfate concentrations in lr groundwater table s4 may reflect pollution from commonly used n p k fertilizers sulfate added to groundwater from fertilizer behaves conservatively in irrigation water where nitrate is also present balci et al 2007 the samples most likely to contain agricultural sulfate pollution are those also containing high nitrate 20 mg l such samples have the same range of δ34sso4 as low nitrate samples fig 9b additions of so4 without cl would generate low cl so4 ratios no evidence of such additions has been found table s4 sulfate in high nitrate lr groundwater is not distinctive in δ34sso4 or in δ18oso4 fig 9a therefore sulfate isotopes in this case fail to identify agricultural sulfate pollution 4 7 water management implications considered together isotope data collected in the srb over the last decade indicate that ancient precipitation has contributed and continues to contribute much of the water currently being used in the srb ma et al 2013 wang et al 2015a 2015b 2016 accelerated melting of the ice archive of ancient precipitation in a warming climate regime may exhaust this source of water in the interior of asia climate has been warming since 1950 lone et al 2021 ma et al 2013 wang et al 2010 whether the loss of ancient ice will be compensated or exacerbated by changes in precipitation amount remains to be evaluated long term water management and agricultural plans should take account of the worst case scenario which is accelerating melting of glaciers concurrent with gradually decreasing precipitation 5 conclusions 1 the similar lmwls for the ur of the srb δd 7 8δ18o 18 1 and the ur of the hrb indicate that similar moisture sources and condensation processes operate throughout the qilian mountains however in august 2018 strong monsoon activity advected moisture to the srb headwaters generating precipitation with δ18o and δd values lower than those observed in years with westerly moisture sources 2 values of δ18o and δd indicate an evaporation trend of slope near 5 in ur surface water of the shule river evaporated surface water in the shule dang and heihe rivers originates from different points on the lmwl observations best explained by different mixtures of recent precipitation with ancient precipitation archived in ice 3 values of δ18o and δd in groundwater result from mixing of three types of water 1 present day runoff in the shule river 2 ice accumulated over the past 12 ka and 3 evaporated water that originated as precipitation with δ18o values between 14 and 20 groundwater in sub basins recharged from the shule tashi and dang rivers has distinctive arrays of δ18o and δd data corresponding to different mixing proportions of the three water types 4 type 3 water did not originate as precipitation from the last 12 ka but may represent incursions of monsoonal moisture prior to 12 ka such an incursion was regional in the hexi corridor affecting the basins of the heihe and shule rivers and the beishan 5 groundwater of this study can be classed as recent water with short residence time old water with long residence time and mixed water mixtures of old water and post bomb precipitation in many cases the residence times of older recharge cannot be well constrained by 14c because of mixing arising either from sampling well construction or from irrigation reflux 6 sulfate in the surface and groundwater water originates from evaporitic gypsum and oxidized sulfide in the ur with possible contributions of regional dust sulfate in the mr and lr sulfate from fertilizer cannot be distinguished isotopically from mixtures of the natural sources credit authorship contribution statement cong

3162,isotopes δ18o and δd δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 tritium and 14c were employed to reveal moisture sources in precipitation and sources of surface water and groundwater as well as groundwater residence

incursion of the indian summer monsoon in august 2018 resulting in abnormally low δ18o and δd values surface water in the upper srb yields an evaporation trend of slope near 5 with an origin near δ18o 10 on the lmwl other catchments of similar altitude in the qilian mountains have evaporation trends with different origin points indicating different input fractions of meltwater from ancient ice for

representing precipitation over the last 12 ka and 3 evaporated water that cannot be explained as precipitation from the last 12 ka type 3 water originated as water with δ18o values between 14 and 20

isotopes δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 in dissolved sulfate from groundwater and surface water indicate mixing of sulfur derived from evaporite and sulfide but do not identify sulfate pollution from fertilizer

social development in the region over recent decades population has increased rapidly leading to a sharp increase in water demand in an area with limited resources guo et al 2015a 2015b groundwater is a vital source of irrigation and drinking water in arid and semiarid regions and water withdrawals commonly exceed natural rates of renewal edmunds 2003 causing large declines in groundwater levels qiu 2010 this is the case for china in addition salinization of groundwater occurs in many areas as a result of river regulation land use change irrigation and groundwater exploitation huang and pang 2012 given the rapid economic development and increasing population in the shule river basin srb an improved understanding of the regional water cycle including moisture sources and groundwater recharge mechanisms is essential for regional planning the srb is an inland river basin located at the western end of the hexi corridor in northwest china fig 1 the shule river rises in the qilian mountains and flows through the yumen tashi sub basin to the lower gobi desert where it disappears ma et al 2005 groundwater and river water are important sources for oases in the middle and lower regions of the srb the water is used mainly for farmland irrigation near changma in the yumen tashi sub basin huahai in the huahai sub basin and shuangta in the guazhou sub basin guo et al 2015a 2015b zhao 2017 by 2020 the population had increased to 5 4 105 as a result of the migration of a large agricultural workforce to the region concurrently the area of irrigated farmland has grown to 1 3 103 km2 water resources bulletin of gansu province 2020 over pumping of groundwater for irrigation has caused the hydraulic heads in aquifers to decreased by 0 15 m a from 2000 to 2010 wang et al 2016 large scale agriculture and other human activities have also led to severe sulfate pollution and deterioration of drinking water quality through acidification and salinization who 1998 examples of high so4 2 concentrations in river water average 199 mg l and shallow groundwater average 383 mg l are documented in the heihe river basin hrb adjacent to the study area li et al 2013a 2013b moreover the disparity between high evaporation rates and low precipitation has caused water resource shortage and degradation therefore understanding the sources and quality of groundwater and surface water in this region is of great significance to the sustainable development and effective management of water resources in the basin in hydrological studies stable isotopes δ18o and δd have been used to constrain atmospheric moisture sources and the sources and interactions of surface water and groundwater e g fontes 1980 gat 1996 clark and fritz 1997 tritium 3h t has a half life of 12 43 years unterweger 1980 and is useful for differentiating recharge prior to and since the atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons eastoe et al 2011 the annually averaged concentration of tritium in precipitation at mid latitudes over most of the world was lower than 10 tu before 1952 clark and fritz 1997 in the region including the study area natural tritium concentrations appear to be near 10 tu zhao et al 2018 an anthropogenic pulse of tritium unrelated to atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons is recorded in 1987 2002 rainwater from zhangye in the hrb zhao et al 2018 and is likely to have affected the srb also for older groundwater radiocarbon in dissolved inorganic carbon is useful in constraining residence time geyh 2000 eastoe et al 2010 values of δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 can be used to determine the sources of sulfate in surface water and groundwater and the effects of fractionating processes such as redox reactions seal et al 2000 sulfate sources can be identified more precisely if δ18oso4 values are used in conjunction with δ34sso4 for example where oxidation of sulfide is a source of sulfate or where δ34sso4 values in source materials overlap previous studies focused on separate parts of the srb for example wang et al 2015 focused on the upper ur and middle mr reaches he et al 2015 and guo et al 2017 on the mr guo et al 2015 on the mr and lower reaches lr and ma et al 2013 and wang et al 2016 on the lr only none of them attempted to interpret the isotope data at the basin scale or in the context of an extensive dataset for o and h isotopes in dated ice of the region spanning the last 12 ka thompson 2000 takeuchi et al 2009 li et al 2015 the qilian mountains which function as a natural water tower for the hexi corridor of china are essentially the only local source of water sun et al 2016 wang et al 2018 in the high altitude area of the qilian mountains where water resources originate li et al 2013a 2013b and in the lower parts of the srb there has been little systematic study of the origins of surface water and ages of groundwater a new dataset consisting of multiple isotope parameters δ18o δd 3h 14c and sulfate isotopes is presented table s1 s2 s3 and s4 in our study our data represent 163 precipitation samples and 13 snowpack samples collected in the ur and 153 surface water samples and 80 groundwater samples from throughout the srb we also use previously published data for δ18o and δd as follows to add to the dataset for the local meteoric water line lmwl in the headwaters of the srb we use data for precipitation in the ur wu et al 2016 to relate ice archives to regional hydrology we cite isotope data to for the dunde ice sheet thompson 2000 takeuchi et al 2009 and for ice meltwater of laohugou wu et al 2016 and shiyi li et al 2015 glaciers we include previous datasets for surface water and groundwater in the mr and lr he 2013 li et al 2015 ma et al 2013 wang et al 2015a 2015b wang et al 2016 to provide a full regional picture of the contributions of meltwater to aquifers of the srb in addition previously published δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 of surface water and groundwater from the neighboring hrb li et al 2013a 2013b are compared with similar data for the srb the major goals of the study were 1 to investigate the modern moisture sources in the headwaters of srb 2 to relate values of δ18o and δd in surface water to those in the regional ice archives 3 to improve the understanding of the origins of surface water and groundwater in the srb along with residence times of the latter 4 to investigate the role of climate change in particular changes in sources of moisture over time in generating the large ranges of δ18o and δd values in srb groundwater and surface water 5 to constrain the sources of dissolved sulfate in the srb our results will provide an improved basis for planning to prevent further degradation of the regional environment in the srb 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the srb is

collection stored in 2 ml glass bottles and refrigerated at 4 c until measurement data of wu et al 2016 in the ur representing may to october in 2013 were used in addition to the new data to construct a lmwl for ur of the srb in addition we also cite the lmwl of the srb from zhao 2017 in changma 96 49 e 39 52 n 2160 m a s l shuangta 99 52 e 40 33 n 1171 m a s l danghe reservoir 96 18 e 39 57 n 1406

the shule river are shown in fig 1 with detail in figs s1 and s2 a total of 80 153 and 13 representative groundwater surface water and snowpack samples respectively were obtained samples for measurement of δ18o and δd were stored in rinsed 2 ml glass storage vials sealed with parafilm beneath the lids for measurement of 14c we precipitated dissolved inorganic carbon dic from 25l samples in the field four such samples were taken at each site qi et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 samples for 3h measurement were stored in sealed 500 ml glass bottles washed at least five times before collecting 2 4 analysis of stable isotopes and radioactive isotopes values of δ18o and δd were measured using a picarro l2140 water isotope analyzer at the shaanxi key laboratory of earth surface system and environmental carrying capacity northwest university xi an china to avoid memory effects each sample was measured ten times and the first three measurements were discarded the analytical precision 1σ was better than 0 1 for δd and 0 025 for δ18o the values of δ18o and δd are calibrated using international standards vsmow and slap coplen 1995 three working standards with values given as δ18o δd

tritium samples were electrolytically enriched and then measured by low background liquid scintillation spectrometry in a quantulus 1220 instrument the detection limit was 1 0 tu carbon from dic was converted into benzene the 14c content was measured in a quantulus 1220 low background liquid scintillation spectrometer qi et al 2016 the analytical precision 1σ varied from about 1 0 pmc near 14 0

precipitation we used the ncep ncar national centers for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research wang et al 2017 reanalysis datasets to calculate the wind and humidity fields at 600 hpa in january and august for 2018 and 2019 for the hexi corridor region 3 results 3 1 stable o and h isotopes 3 1 1 precipitation precipitation δ18o and δd at suli in the ur ranged from 20 8

hrb zhao et al 2018 suggesting that similar factors affect the isotope data in precipitation throughout the qilian mountains many data with δ18o 2 plot to the right of the lmwl because of evaporation from falling raindrops fig 3 the lmwl of the srb from zhao 2017 has lower slope than the ur lmwl indicating secondary evaporation caused by dry conditions in the mr and lr in common with other datasets for precipitation at high altitude in the qilian mountains summer rain june september has high mean monthly values of δ18o usually 5 while rain at other times of the year has values 10 zhao et al 2011 fig 4 for 2018 amount weighted means of δ18o δd in august at suli were 12 3 79 8 which were significantly lower than those of urumqi controlled by the westerlies hong kong controlled by the east asian summer monsoon and in the srb in other years zhao 2017 fig 4 in addition the amount weighted means of δ18o were lower from july to september fig 4 consistent with the isotope pattern observed in lhasa where precipitation is controlled by the indian summer monsoon ism 3 1 2 surface water more negative values of δ18o δd of surface water were found in the ur arithmetic means 8 6 53 9

lmwl near a δ18o value of 10 4 the slope 5 is best defined in the ur for which more data are available fig 5 b values of δ18o and δd of snowpack samples collected in april 2018 and december 2020 plot close to the lmwl and are much lower than those of shule river water collected in the same period in the ur values of δ18o and δd of laohugou ice meltwater wu et al 2016 and shiyi snow ice meltwater

to 105 4 pmc in a plot of tritium vs 14c fig 8 no separation of ur mr and lr samples or of shallow and deep groundwaters emerges a group of young waters has high tritium 8 13 tu and 14c content 80 105 pmc as expected for post bomb recharge that has dissolved some rock carbon groundwaters with 80 pmc have a wide range of tritium content from below detection to 22 tu 3 3 sulfate isotopes in surface water and groundwater values of δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 of groundwater varied from 3 2 to 12 4 and 1 8 to 15 5 with arithmetic means of 9 6 and 9 3 respectively in surface water δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 ranged from 1 0 to 11 0 and from 2 2 to 10 5 with arithmetic means of 6 1 and 5 1 respectively table s4 the arithmetic means of δ34sso4 δ18oso4 values of the groundwater were 5 6 7 6 9 3 11 4 and 10 9 8 4 in the ur mr and lr respectively mean so4 2 and no3 concentrations are 559 5 mg l and 6 8 mg l in groundwater and 323 2 mg l and 2 4 mg l in river water respectively table s2 and s3 4 discussion 4 1 usefulness of tritium and 14c data in fig 8 groundwater can be classified into three groups group 1 green area has high uncorrected 14c activity 80 pmc and represents groundwater of short residence time mainly post bomb recharge with some mixing with older water group 2 blue area has low tritium 10 tu and 14c activity 80 pmc with shallow and deep groundwater in the srb indicating recharge mainly from pre bomb precipitation group 3 yellow area is an intermediate group with uncorrected 14c values of 15 80 pmc and tritium contents above 15 tu indicating mixtures of old water and post bomb precipitation e g gw 2 in the ur 16 7 tu 16 4 pmc in the mr and lr this study like that of zhao et al 2018 shows that mixing of water of different residence times is typical mixing may occur in wells with long screens that sample water of different residence times or as a result of irrigation reflux of low pmc irrigation water mixed with post bomb rainwater at the surface tritium data are useful for identifying groundwater containing some recent recharge tritium in zhangye precipitation from 1985 assuming 35 tu see fig 5 of zhao et al 2018 will remain detectable 1 5 tu until about 2040 tritium in 2002 precipitation average 20 tu after the regional anthropogenic pulse of tritium will remain detectable until about 2050 these calculations assume no mixing between with older groundwater residence times estimated from 14c data are useful only as approximate indications for samples with tritium below detection correction of 14c data will not be attempted here because correction protocols cannot readily be applied to groundwater mixtures 4 2 moisture sources in the upper region normally both summer and winter precipitation in the qilian mountains originate as moisture transported from the west yu et al 2006 yao et al 2009 zhao et al 2011 zhao et al 2016 jiang et al 2019 the westerly circulation pattern yielded consisitent seasonal patterns of δ18o from 2013 to 2016 in srb and urumqi zhao 2017 fig 4 abnormally negative δ18o in precipitation from august 2018 and a similar trend of δ18o in lhasa in combination with wind directions revealed a strong incursion of ism moisture into the ur of the srb figs 4 and 7 at present and during the holocene the east asian summer monsoon easm appears to have extended no further west than longitude 101 e under most conditions li et al 2018 and therefore does not bring moisture to the hrb and srb on the tibetan plateau the influence of the ism at present extends to 33 34 n on the basis of isotope data in precipitation tian et al 2001 also failing to reach the hrb and srb under usual conditions a past incursion 12 ka of the ism into the qilian mountains has been suggested by zhao et al 2018 as an explanation of the isotope composition of type 3 groundwater fig 6 the monsoon moisture in august 2018 was advected around the eastern edge of the tibetan plateau and imparted a low δ18o signature to precipitation these observations strengthen the argument that past incursions of ism might explain the low values of δ18o and δd in type 3 groundwater 4 3 sources of surface water in qilian mountains the ur el intersects the ur lmwl and snow ice meltwater lines for the laohugou and shiyi at δ18o near 10 4 corresponding to a mixture of precipitation with high altitude meltwater fig 5 our results are consistent with those of zhang et al 2019 who estimated an average contribution of 23 6 of glacier meltwater to ur surface water from 1971 to 2013 the intersection for the dang river el with the ur lmwl is poorly defined but appears to be at δ18o 12 data of he 2013 ma et al 2013 while the intersection for the heihe river with the ur lmwl for that basin is at 8 1 zhao et al 2018 glacial meltwater therefore contributes a larger fraction to the dang river than to the other rivers consistent with ma et al 2013 who observed that the meltwater contributes significantly to dang river the distinctive surface water in each basin might be an artefact of sampling in different years if the mean δ18o and δd of precipitation change from year to year however groundwater commonly integrates the isotope variations of surface water over multiple years both surface water and groundwater indicate a source on the lmwl near δ18o 10 in the ur of the srb despite their similar ranges of altitude and climate each basin appears to have a distinctive source of surface water the reasons are discussed below 4 4 sources of groundwater in the middle and lower regions groundwater of the mr and lr plots within a quadrilateral three sides of which can be considered as distinctive sources of water and end members of mixing labled 1 2 and 3 in fig 6 type 1 is shule river surface water type 2 corresponds to the isotope composition of ice accumulated in the dunde ice sheet between 12 ka and 2005 ce thompson 2000 takeuchi et al 2009 and type 3 comprising a group of evaporated waters delimits the data downwards corresponding to a pre 12 ka incursion of the ism as discussed by zhao et al 2018 among the water types the following kinds of mixing occur a lr groundwater sampled in this study forms a linear trend between type 1 and older type 2 at the type 2 end of the trend are samples gw 12 and 13 groundwater associated with the tashi river the mixing is therefore between water derived from shule and tashi rivers which enter the lr separately b mr groundwater forms a poorly defined mixing trend between type 1 and younger type 2 c groundwater in the mr near the tashi river wang et al 2016 includes type 2 mixtures of type 2 with evaporated type 3 and mixtures of type 2 with unevaporated type 3 source water d lr groundwater from the dunhuang sub basin this study ma et al 2013 plots between types 2 pre 1925 dunde ice and 3 so also does most beishan groundwater wang et al 2015a 2015b e ur groundwater data coincide with the evaporation trend for ur surface water the dunde ice sheet does not lie within the srb fig 1b its importance to this study lies in providing a continuous record of isotopes in precipitation archived as ice over the last 12 ka fig 6c a record that we assume applies to all ice of similar age present or formerly present in the srb such ice is the source of type 2 water at dunde ice about 12 ka old rests on bedrock thompson 2000 earlier ice was removed suggesting a warm climatic event just prior to 12 ka earlier ice may not have been uniformly removed in neighboring parts of the qilian mountains as will be discussed below zhao et al 2018 noted that the source of type 3 water in the hrb could not be found in the dunde ice archive or in recent precipitation this study confirms the regional presence of similar water in the hexi corridor beishan and qilian mountains assuming an evaporation slope of 5 justified by measurements on present day surface water fig 5b pre evaporation values of δ18o of type 3 water on the lmwl or the dunde ice line are between 14 and 20 too low to originate from ice like that at dunde but resembling present day ism precipitation on the tibetan plateau fig 6a e g in present day surface water in southern tibet ice at noijin kangsang from 1864 to 2006 and precipitation at lhasa zhao et al 2012 international atomic energy agency 2021b incursion of the ism into the qilian mountains prior to 12 ka ago may account for type 3 water zhao et al 2018 present day snowpack and winter precipitation also overlap type 3 source water in isotope composition fig 5a and 6a wang et al 2016 suggested that present meltwater from snowpack and ice was the source of type 3 groundwater near the tashi river we propose that the origin of type 3 water is precipitation archived as ice older than 12 ka for the following reasons 1 winter precipitation at present makes up only about 20 of total precipitation in the region zhou et al 2015 2 present day surface water in main stem of the shule river did not resemble snowpack or winter precipitation in 2018 and 2020 this study or in 2011 2013 he et al 2015 under present climatic conditions the shule river does not deliver type 3 water to the mr and lr 3 bulk precipitation since 12 ka as evidenced by ice at dunde cannot provide runoff of the required composition the set of end members in fig 6a and 6b is consistent with the evolution of precipitation sources and isotopes in the qilian mountains as suggested by zhao et al 2018 prior to 12 ka at a time that cannot be specified more precisely precipitation had isotope characteristics of present day ism precipitation on the tibetan plateau in the hexi corridor region long term incursion of the ism or the easm extended north into beishan since 12 ka most moisture has been advected from the west and has evolved isotopically as shown in fig 6c the isotope composition of high altitude precipitation is unlikely to have differed across the catchments of the srb for which water isotope data exist the shule river mainstem dang and tashi rivers instead the catchments may have differed in the timing and relative amounts of contributions of end members 2 and 3 to runoff types 2 and 3 water are present in ancient groundwater dunhuang sub basin and beishan and in runoff dang river the degree of evaporation of each end member varies between sub catchments e g the type 3 component of groundwater is highly evaporated near the dang river but not in all cases near the tashi river which is shorter and steeper in gradient ice corresponding to type 3 appears to persist and contribute strongly to runoff in the dang and tashi river catchments but may be absent in the ur of the shule and heihe rivers however due to the uncertainties and limitations of the stable isotope method it is difficult to quantify the contribution of different recharge sources scanlon et al 2002 shi et al 2021 4 5 long term climate change in the srb regional and global contexts the lack of bulk δ18o values lower than 11 5 in dunde ice fig 6c thompson 2000 indicates that a strong positive shift in δ18o from 14 to 11 5 occurred in qilian mountains precipitation before 12 ka late pleistocene to early holocene shifts of this nature have been documented in many regions across the globe they are commonly ascribed to temperature change following the last ice age jasechko et al 2015 well dated isotope shifts at 10 12 ka in greenland ice johnsen et al 2001 and 13 15 ka in southwestern north america wagner et al 2010 may be compared with the pre 12 ka isotope shift in the qilian mountains where the δ18o shift is larger than elsewhere and is probably due to changing predominant wind directions zhao et al 2018 another large positive and apparently accelerating shift in δ18o of qilian mountains precipitation since the 19th century present in dunde ice fig 6c using data from takeuchi et al 2009 li et al 2015 correlates in time with climatic drying and loss of surface water in the tarim basin to the west of the srb putnam et al 2016 the present study confirms the regional extent of the pre 12 ka isotope shift in the qilian mountains and north to the beishan mountains jiang et al 2019 attempted to date isotope shifts in several arid basins of north china including the shule and heihe river basins on the basis of simple relations between δ18o δd and corrected 14c content in groundwater this study and zhao et al 2018 indicate that interpreting the timing of isotope shifts in these basins is more complicated than assumed in jiang et al 2019 recharge of ancient precipitation in the piedmont basins occurs in part after delayed melting of ice archives preserving the ancient stable isotope signatures but imparting a 14c signature younger than that of the ancient precipitation 4 6 identifying sulfate sources in fig 9 a the δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 for the srb are compared with likely sulfate sources much of the ranges of both δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 is present in the ur of the shule river where the following sources of sulfate are likely lower carboniferous marine lcm sulfate is present in a gypsum evaporite at the base of the carboniferous to triassic shelf sediments tong 2016 sulfide sources include cambrian volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits and their host rocks jiang et al 1999 and organic rich shelf sediments zuza et al 2018 that are likely sources of bacterially reduced sulfur sulfate formed by oxidation of such sulfide is likely to have a broad range of δ34sso4 and low values of δ18oso4 related to δ18o of meteoric water at the site of oxidation of sulfide van stempvoort et al 1994 regional dust sulfate represented by three gypsum nodules from the chinese loess plateau near xining and lanzhou jeong and lee 2010 is a third possible source the shule and heihe river catchments have similar geology li et al 2013a 2013b zuza et al 2018 meng et al 2020 but the δ34sso4 ranges of sulfide derived sulfate differ in the two basins and data for heihe river surface water form a linear trend that is not present in the shule river fig 9 in the srb groundwater in the ur and surface water have similar ranges of δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 forming a broad array best explained as mixing between evaporite sulfate and sulfate formed by oxidation of sulfide of wide ranging δ34sso4 the data for the mr and lr groundwater including several examples of old groundwater as defined in fig 8 plot between loess gypsum and lcm sulfate suggesting that sulfate in the mr and lr consists of mixtures of the regional dust sulfate with lcm sulfate fig 9 the mixed water type of fig 8 has a wider range of δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 than young and old water consistent with the complex mixing of sulfate in irrigation water and rainwater high sulfate concentrations in lr groundwater table s4 may reflect pollution from commonly used n p k fertilizers sulfate added to groundwater from fertilizer behaves conservatively in irrigation water where nitrate is also present balci et al 2007 the samples most likely to contain agricultural sulfate pollution are those also containing high nitrate 20 mg l such samples have the same range of δ34sso4 as low nitrate samples fig 9b additions of so4 without cl would generate low cl so4 ratios no evidence of such additions has been found table s4 sulfate in high nitrate lr groundwater is not distinctive in δ34sso4 or in δ18oso4 fig 9a therefore sulfate isotopes in this case fail to identify agricultural sulfate pollution 4 7 water management implications considered together isotope data collected in the srb over the last decade indicate that ancient precipitation has contributed and continues to contribute much of the water currently being used in the srb ma et al 2013 wang et al 2015a 2015b 2016 accelerated melting of the ice archive of ancient precipitation in a warming climate regime may exhaust this source of water in the interior of asia climate has been warming since 1950 lone et al 2021 ma et al 2013 wang et al 2010 whether the loss of ancient ice will be compensated or exacerbated by changes in precipitation amount remains to be evaluated long term water management and agricultural plans should take account of the worst case scenario which is accelerating melting of glaciers concurrent with gradually decreasing precipitation 5 conclusions 1 the similar lmwls for the ur of the srb δd 7 8δ18o 18 1 and the ur of the hrb indicate that similar moisture sources and condensation processes operate throughout the qilian mountains however in august 2018 strong monsoon activity advected moisture to the srb headwaters generating precipitation with δ18o and δd values lower than those observed in years with westerly moisture sources 2 values of δ18o and δd indicate an evaporation trend of slope near 5 in ur surface water of the shule river evaporated surface water in the shule dang and heihe rivers originates from different points on the lmwl observations best explained by different mixtures of recent precipitation with ancient precipitation archived in ice 3 values of δ18o and δd in groundwater result from mixing of three types of water 1 present day runoff in the shule river 2 ice accumulated over the past 12 ka and 3 evaporated water that originated as precipitation with δ18o values between 14 and 20 groundwater in sub basins recharged from the shule tashi and dang rivers has distinctive arrays of δ18o and δd data corresponding to different mixing proportions of the three water types 4 type 3 water did not originate as precipitation from the last 12 ka but may represent incursions of monsoonal moisture prior to 12 ka such an incursion was regional in the hexi corridor affecting the basins of the heihe and shule rivers and the beishan 5 groundwater of this study can be classed as recent water with short residence time old water with long residence time and mixed water mixtures of old water and post bomb precipitation in many cases the residence times of older recharge cannot be well constrained by 14c because of mixing arising either from sampling well construction or from irrigation reflux 6 sulfate in the surface and groundwater water originates from evaporitic gypsum and oxidized sulfide in the ur with possible contributions of regional dust sulfate in the mr and lr sulfate from fertilizer cannot be distinguished isotopically from mixtures of the natural sources credit authorship contribution statement cong

3163,nutrient loading caused by human activities can drive changes in methane ch4 production pathways yet the mechanisms and magnitudes of estuary ch4 emissions remain poorly understood here we investigated ch4 fluxes and δ 13c ch4 values in wet and dry seasons from five subtropical estuaries with varying human activity intensity and hydrologic conditions water dissolved ch4 concentrations varied from 0 19 to 0 51 µmol ch4 l 1 in these studied estuaries resulting in coincident water air ch4 fluxes ranging from 5 46 to 29 6 µg ch4 m 2h 1 water ch4 concentrations and fluxes were significantly lower in the wet than dry season and were higher in the high human impacted estuaries indicating that large discharge and water flow could slow down areal ch4 emissions the ratios of c ch4 to organic carbon oc were much higher and showed a positive response to increasing nitrogen concentrations in high human impacted estuaries suggesting that eutrophic estuaries trigger high ch4 emissions in addition an increase in δ 13c ch4 and a declining in fractionation factor α app from the low to high human impacted estuaries were accompanied by a switch of ch4 production from hydrogenotrophic to acetoclastic pathways these results suggest that human activity intensity can drive the alterations in the pathways and magnitudes of ch4 production and that hydrologic conditions can modify ch4 emissions which have important implications for estimates of ch4 emissions from global estuaries under increasing human activity intensity keywords methane hydrologic characteristics human activity eutrophication climate warming subtropical estuary 1 introduction methane ch4 an important greenhouse gas contributes about 20 of global radiative forcing ipcc 2013 and thus plays an important role in global climate warming kirschke et al 2013 estuaries are increasingly recognized as a significant contributor to the global carbon cycle and greenhouse gas emissions borges and abril 2011 bauer et al 2013 and account for 3 of ch4 emission from natural sources borges and abril 2011 ch4 production is highly dependent on temperature yvon durocher et al 2014 wik et al 2014 oxygen concentration steinle et al 2017 and organic carbon quality romeijn et al 2019 thus leading to a large variation in ch4 emissions across diverse aquatic ecosystems kirschke et al 2013 sawakuchi et al 2014 crawford et al 2017 rosentreter et al 2017 therefore estuary ch4 emissions become increasingly important in the context of global climate warming and human activity cloern et al 2016 cotovicz et al 2016 beaulieu et al 2019 wells et al 2020 numerous studies examined the spatial and temporal variations of estuary ch4 emissions cotovicz et al 2016 rosentreter et al 2017 crucial uncertainties however still exist in terms of estuary ch4 production pathways and emission magnitudes in response to varying human activity intensity which can trigger large constraints on the projections of ch4 emissions from global estuaries ch4 is primarily produced from organic molecule decomposition acetoclastic pathway or co2 reduction hydrogenotrophic pathway under anaerobic conditions flury and ulseth 2019 but their importance to ch4 production is highly variable in different aquatic environments in oligotrophic environments ch4 production is derived mainly from co2 reduction due to limited energy for methanogens stegen et al 2018 large inputs of nutrient from human activity can intensify oxygen consumption and exacerbate water eutrophication which in return increases labile organic matter production high availability and quality of organic matter combined with low dissolved oxygen conditions can dramatically trigger anaerobic ch4 production cloern et al 2016 beaulieu et al 2019 consequently estuary ch4 production could be switched from hydrogenotrophic to acetoclastic pathways when human activity intensifies it should be noted that ch4 production and consumption can cause 13c fractionation whiticar 1999 it is known that 13c can be depleted in ch4 production whereas ch4 oxidation increases δ 13c ch4 conrad 1999 whiticar 1999 in addition acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic pathways have quite different δ 13c ch4 values whiticar 1999 huang and hall 2018 therefore an apparent fractionation factor αapp between δ 13c co2 and δ 13c ch4 can distinguish major ch4 production pathway in natural environments whiticar 1999 conrad 2005 hydrologic conditions can also provide additional constraints water residence time for benthic ch4 production or water column ch4 oxidation on ch4 emission in estuaries rosentreter et al 2018 wells et al 2020 hydrologic changes between the wet and dry seasons can affect ch4 production and emission by altering biogeochemical factors for benthic ch4 production and gas transfer velocity ho et al 2016 rosentreter et al 2017 in addition dissolved oxygen concentrations affected by water residence time have great influence on ch4 production and oxidation rosentreter et al 2018 flury and ulseth 2019 subsequently resulting in different ch4 emissions large water discharge and high water turbulence can increase ch4 emission rosentreter et al 2018 groundwater contributes largely to ch4 emissions in mangrove dominated estuaries dutta et al 2015 rosentreter et al 2018 and small estuaries surrounded by wetlands sadat noori et al 2016 their importance to surface water ch4 dynamics in estuaries spanning hydrologic condition gradients is yet to be validated therefore there is a large knowledge gap about how the differences and changes in hydrologic conditions modify estuary ch4 emission the objective of this study was to determine the mechanisms and magnitudes of estuary ch4 emissions driven by different human activity intensities and hydrologic conditions we hypothesized that estuary ch4 emissions would increase with the increasing human activity intensity and will be higher in dry than wet seasons which could be due to long water residence time and low dissolved oxygen conditions favoring biological ch4 production and higher methanogenic substrate availability promoting anaerobic acetoclastic pathway of ch4 production we tested this hypothesis by seasonal measurements of ch 4 concentrations fluxes and isotopic δ 13c ch4 compositions in five subtropical estuaries with varying human activity intensity and hydrologic conditions this study can improve understanding of mechanisms underlying ch4 production and emission in estuarine environments 2 material and methods 2 1 study area in this study field surveys were carried out in five subtropical estuaries in fujian province of southeast china in may 2019 and june 2020 wet seasons and october 2019 and october 2020 dry seasons figure s1 mean annual temperature and precipitation range from 18 1 to 21 4 c and from 1231 to 1450 mm while the majority of precipitation falls between march and september these selected estuaries subsequently referred to by their river names encompass different hydrologic characteristics and human activity intensity table 1 min river is characterized by the greatest length and catchment area and mulan river exhibits the lowest discharge and catchment area human activity intensity was defined by the city population and sewage outlets along the estuaries corresponding to differences in nitrogen loading table 1 these five estuaries were classified as low human activity intensity jiaoxi river estuary moderate human activity intensity mulan river estuary and high human activity intensity min river estuary jin river estuary and jiulong river estuary table 1 gives more detailed information about hydrologic characteristics climatic variables and human activity intensity in these studied estuaries 2 2 samples collection and measurements water and gas samples were collected in triplicate from five sites along the salinity gradient within each estuary all samples were collected through the main channel under the duration of high tide surface water was pumped from 20 cm water depth and stored in a 50 ml gas tight glass serum bottle with no headspace and was then immediately preserved by adding 100 µl of saturated hgcl2 to stop microbial activity another 500 ml of water was sampled with polyethylene bottles for measuringt of water parameters benthic sediments were collected using a grab bucket air gas at 1 m above the water surface was collected in a 50 ml airbag delin dalian china the water samples were stored in a cool box and gas samples were kept in dark conditions and then transported to the laboratory within 6 h 222rn concentrations of surface water were measured using a radon analyzer rad7 durridge air temperature wind speed and atmospheric pressure at 1 m above the water surface were determined by a digital anemometer as h6 aicevoss china and manometer gm510 benetech china respectively water temperature ph conductivity and dissolved oxygen do were measured with a portable multi parameter meter sl1000 hach usa water velocity and salinity were determined by a portable flow meter ls300 a xiangruide china and a salinity meter ysi model 30 inc yellow springs ohio usa respectively dissolved organic carbon doc in sediments was extracted via deionized water total nitrogen tn and doc in surface water and sediments were measured using a toc analyzer toc vcph shimadzu kyoto japan po4 3 p was determined with a continuous flow nutrient autoanalyzer san plus skalar analytical b v 400 ml of water sample was filtered through gf f glass fiber filter whatman and the suspended particle on the filter was then weighed after drying 2 3 ch4 concentration and flux dissolved ch4 concentration in the water sample was determined by the headspace equilibrium technique wanninkhof 1992 briefly 20 ml of headspace was created by replacing the equal volume of ultrahigh purity helium and the bottle was then shaken vigorously for 30 min to keep the gas equilibrium between water and gas phases the ch4 in headspace gas was measured using a gas chromatograph gc 2014 shimadzu kyoto japan equipped with a flame ionization detector fid dissolved ch4 concentration was then calculated based on the bunsen solubility coefficient as a function of temperature and salinity wanninkhof 1992 farías et al 2017 water ch4 saturation relative to the atmospheric equilibrium was also determined cole et al 2010 diffusive ch4 flux across the water air interface is calculated using the thin boundary layer equation liss and slater 1974 flury and ulseth 2019 1 f w k x c w c eq m 1000 where f w is the ch4 flux µg m 2h 1 kx denotes the gas transfer velocity cm h 1 c w is the measured concentration of ch4 in water sample nmol l 1 c eq stands for water saturation of ch4 concentration nmol l 1 m represents the molar mass of ch4 16 g mol 1 the physical transfer of gas across the water air interface is empirically parameterized to account for wind speed borges abril 2011 wells et al 2018 we

the wind speed at 1 m above the water surface m s 1 the s c is calculated according to the following equation wanninkhof 1992 flury and ulseth 2019 7 s c 1897 8 114 28 t 3 2902 t 2 0 039061 t 3 where t is the in situ measured water temperature oc 2 4 analysis and calculation of δ 13ch4 and α app water sample for analysis of δ 13c ch4 and δ 13c co2 was pumped at a water depth of 20 cm and stored in a 120 ml gas tight glass serum bottle the bottle was immediately preserved by adding 200 µl of saturated solution of hgcl2 without any bubbles headspace in the bottle was created by injecting 30 ml of ultrahigh purity helium the δ 13c ch4 and δ 13c co2 in headspace gas were determined using an isotope ratio mass spectrometry thermo fisher delta v plus coupled to a gas chromatograph the 13c 12c ratios of ch4 and co2 are referenced to the standard vienna pee dee belemnite vpdb carbon stable isotopes of co2 and ch4 are converted to standard δ 13c notation and reported in per mile given that carbon cycling and atmospheric ch4 can affect the water δ 13c a two pool mixing equation was used to calibrate the measured δ 13c ch4 wells et al 2020 8 δ 13 c c h 4 δ 13 c c h 4 mix c mia δ 13 c c h 4 atmos c atmos c mix c atmos where c mix is the measured dissolved water ch4 concentration δ 13c ch4 mix is the dissolved water ch4 isotopic composition c atmos is the water ch4 concentration at 100 atmospheric saturation and δ 13c ch4 atmos denotes the isotopic composition 47 of atmospheric ch4 whiticar 1999 the δ 13c ch4 values from the acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic pathways varied between 32 and 70 valentine et al 2004 huang and hall 2018 and between 55 and 115 corbett et al 2013 huang and hall 2018 respectively the ch4 production can cause the 13c depletion whereas ch4 oxidation increases δ 13c ch4 and decreases δ 13c co2 huang and hall 2018 therefore the fractionation factor α app which is calculated by the ratio between δ 13c co2 and δ 13c ch4 could actually determine the ch4 production pathways conrad 2005 rosentreter et al 2018 flury and ulseth 2019 the α app is estimated according to the below equation conrad 2005 9 α app δ 13 c c o 2 1000 δ 13 c c h 4 1000 where δ 13c co2 and δ 13c ch4 are the isotopic compositions of δ 13c co2 and δ 13c ch4 respectively to distinguish ch4 production between the acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic pathways a threshold value of 1 055 is used for α app as suggested by whiticar 1999 and flury and ulseth 2019 here the α app value 1 055 indicates that co2 reduction is the dominant methanogenic process whereas the α app value 1 055 suggests that the acetoclastic pathway is the dominant methanogenic process 2 5 statistical analysis significant differences in hydrologic variables and ch4 emissions rates across the different seasons and estuaries were examined using two way anova analysis multiple comparisons of δ 13c ch4 δ 13c co2 and αapp between the estuaries were performed using tukey s least significant difference method the best models for explaining the variations in water ch4 concentration saturation and flux were identified using stepwise regression analysis statistical analyses were conducted using spss software version 22 0 spss inc chicago il usa and a p value 0 05 was considered statistically significant for all tests 3 results 3 1 hydrographical characteristics water discharge ranged largely from

did not differ between the wet and dry seasons except for the jx estuary where do concentrations were much lower in the dry than wet seasons water salinity was much higher in the dry than the wet

po4 3 p concentrations were much higher in the mlx estuary than in other estuaries 3 2 water ch4 saturation and concentration these five estuaries were consistently supersaturated in ch4 with saturation generally decreasing along the salinity gradient fig 1 water ch4 saturations were also generally higher in the dry than wet seasons f 42 p 0 001 and increased from the minimally 119 6 0 to

ch4 concentrations were also significantly higher in the dry than wet seasons f 24 p 0 001 3 3 kx value and ch4 flux the kx values varied largely among the diffusion models and sampling sites table 3 kx values ranged from 1 40 to 7 68 cm h 1 for dmw92a from 3 99 to 10 5 cm h 1 for dmrc01 from 2 96 to 6 23 cm h 1 for dmcl98 from 1 35 to 6 06 cm h 1 for dmmy95 from 2 80 to 8 49 cm h 1 for dmcw03 kx values were the highest for dmrc01 followed by dmcw03 and dmcl98 in addition kx values were generally higher in the dry than wet seasons throughout the sampling sites the ch4 fluxes across the sampling sites were in a range of 1 63 46 4 µg m 2h 1 for dmw92a 2 49 69 2 µg m 2h 1 for dmrc01 1 51 40 5 µg m 2h 1 for dmcl98 1 41 37 0 µg m 2h 1 for dmmy95 1 99 52 0 µg m 2h 1 for dmcw03 except for the dry season of 2020 in the jx estuary the ch4 fluxes did not differ among the diffusion models p 0 05 table 3 in addition the average ch4 fluxes of the five models were comparable with the fluxes estimated by dmcl98 the ch4 fluxes estimated by dmcl98 were conservatively used in the subsequent results fig 2e 2f ch4 fluxes ranged from 1 51 to 40 5 µg m 2h 1 across these estuaries and seasons the mean ch4 fluxes varied significantly from the minimally 5 46 4 04 µg m 2h 1 to moderately 9 50 6 20 µg m 2h 1 and then to highly 35 6 10 0 µg m 2h 1 impacted estuaries f 119 p 0 001 ch4 fluxes were also significantly higher in the dry than wet seasons f 106 p 0 001 3 4 water δ 13c ch4 and biological sources the δ 13c ch4 values within each estuary were more negative from freshwater to estuary mouth fig 3 the δ 13c ch4 also increased from 87 in the minimally impacted estuaries to 81 in the moderately impacted estuaries and then to 56 in the highly impacted estuaries f 173 p 0 001 but did not differ significantly between the wet and dry seasons f 7 2 p 0 05 the δ 13c co2 decreased from 11 5 in the minimally impacted estuaries to 13 4 in the moderately and highly impacted estuaries f 4 2 p 0 004 but there was no significant difference in δ 13c co2 between the wet and dry seasons f 4 1 p 0 05 the relationships between δ 13c ch4 and δ 13c co2 differed between the estuaries the αapp values decreased from 1 082 in the minimally impacted estuaries to 1 074 in the moderately impacted estuaries and then to 1 046 in the highly impacted estuaries f 122 p 0 001 and were also higher in the dry than wet seasons f 13 0 p 0 01 in the minimally and moderately impacted estuaries the α app for all the sampled water indicated that ch4 was mainly produced from hydrogenotrophic pathway 95 fig 4 the majority 70 95 of αapp in collected water from the highly impacted estuaries was indicative for acetoclastic ch4 production whereas 5 30 was attributed to the hydrogenotrophic process the ratios of c ch4 to organic carbon c ch4 oc in water samples ranged from 0 14 to 3 27 10 3 fig 5 and the average was higher in the highly impacted estuaries than in the minimally and moderately impacted estuaries p 0 001 the ratios of c ch4 oc positively increased as nitrogen increase in the highly impacted estuaries r 2 0 22 p 0 001 it should be noted however that there were no significant relationships between them in the minimally and moderately impacted estuaries fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 spatial variability of estuary ch4 emissions numerous studies reported increasing magnitudes of water dissolved ch4 concentrations and water air fluxes in estuaries with increasing human activity intensity in this study it was observed that water dissolved ch4 concentrations increased significantly from 0 14 to 0 66 µmol l 1 across these estuaries as human activity intensity increased the mj jj and jlj estuaries with high human activity intensity presented high ch4 concentrations which were 2 3 times higher than those in the minimally impacted estuaries these five studied estuaries were oversaturated in ch4 presenting large potential ch4 emissions in addition high water ch4 concentrations led to corresponding high ch4 saturations fig 2c 2d suggesting that ch4 concentration level is critical for estuary ch4 emission capacity wells et al 2020 we found that water dissolved ch4 concentrations in the five studied estuaries were one order of magnitude higher than those in fitzroy river and constant creek estuaries from 26 to 53 nmol l 1 rosentreter et al 2018 but were comparable to johnstone river estuary from 0 18 to 0 42 µmol l 1 rosentreter et al 2018 and brisbane river estuary from 0 03 to 0 58 µmol l 1 musenze et al 2014 which are both strongly affected by nutrient loading and human activity however the water ch4 concentrations varied from 12 to 40 nmol l 1 in the eight subtropical estuaries of se queensland wells et al 2020 which were much lower than those in our studied estuaries although the eight subtropical estuaries in se queensland presented a land use gradient wells et al 2020 the n concentrations in these estuaries tn 0 31 0 97 mg l 1 were much lower than those in the five studied estuaries tn 0 64 5 59 mg l 1 further confirming that human activity intensity and nutrient loading control the water ch4 concentrations in the human impacted estuaries water air ch4 fluxes increased significantly with increasing human activity intensity corresponding to the water ch4 concentrations across the five estuaries the ch4 fluxes in the five estuaries 5 46 35 6 µg ch4 m 2h 1 estimated by the dmcl98 model were consistent with the eight subtropical estuaries spanning land use gradient in se queensland of australia 6 5 34 5 µg ch4 m 2h 1 wells et al 2020 we also found that the estuary ch4 fluxes of these studies were much lower than those in urban rivers of beijing 2 2 mg ch4 m 2h 1 wang et al 2021 and global mean of streams and rivers 5 5 mg ch4 m 2h 1 stanley et al 2016 therefore human activity intensity and nutrient loading drive the differences of water ch4 fluxes in the estuaries shifting from the low to high ch4 emissions with increasing human activity intensity these results suggest that the positive relationship between eutrophication and ch4 fluxes established for freshwater environments stanley et al 2016 beaulieu et al 2019 may hold for the estuaries in addition the evidence that estuary ch4 emissions would become intense under increasing human activity intensity has great uncertainty in projecting ch4 fluxes of global estuaries in the future since global change and human activity would strongly affect the ecological functions of estuaries cloern et al 2016 the ch4 fluxes calculated from ch4 concentrations are uncertain which could be mainly attributed to the kx values wells et al 2020 the interactions of winds water currents and tides can affect surface water turbulence and gas evasion causing the fundamental uncertainties in kx value calculations ho et al 2016 the large differences in kx values would cause differences in the ch4 fluxes borges abril 2011 which may in return lead to a large uncertainty of the upscaling ch4 emissions however we could not address this gap as it is well beyond the scope of this study notably we compared the ch4 fluxes under the previously reported diffusion models to highlight that kx is better for estimating ch4 fluxes in studied estuaries we found that the kx values varied greatly among the dmw92a dmrc01 dmcl98 dmmy95 and dmcw03 models table 3 however the ch4 fluxes were not significantly variable although there were differences in ch4 fluxes among the diffusion modes in addition the average ch4 fluxes of these five diffusion models were consistent with the fluxes estimated by the dmcl98 model strongly suggesting that the kx of dmcl98 model is critical for ch4 estimation in these estuaries these uncertainties in our ch4 flux estimations emphasize the necessity to standardize how estuary k values are parameterized and highlight the difficulty in comparing estuary ch4 fluxes with previous studies 4 2 estuary ch4 emissions associated with hydrologic conditions hydrologic conditions can affect estuary ch4 emissions because ch4 production and diffusion are greatly affected by these conditions ho et al 2016 rosentreter et al 2017 rosentreter et al 2018 in this study across the three highly impacted estuaries we found that the ch4 fluxes were much lower in the mj than in the jj and jlj estuaries although the mj is a highly impacted estuary water tn and po4 3 p concentrations were much lower mostly because the mj is characterized by the largest discharge and water flow minimizing nutrients concentrations however the mlx as a moderately impacted and minimal discharge and water flow estuary presented a comparable ch4 fluxes with the jx in addition high water turbidity in the mlx could also inhibit the high nutrient from fueling biological growth and further decrease labile c for ch4 production which could be attributed to the poor productivity and photodegradation cory and kling 2018 wells et al 2020 we also found that the ch4 fluxes were significantly lower in the wet than dry seasons which was most likely due to the high water flow weakening benthic ch4 production and decreasing the ch4 residence time rosentreter et al 2018 wells et al 2020 it has also been reported that high water flow can decrease the water residence time so there is not enough time for biogeochemical c reactions and breaking the favorable conditions for ch4 production borges et al 2018 rosentreter et al 2018 the differences in water velocities between the estuaries can drive the variations of ch4 diffusion capacity with high water velocity increasing ch4 diffusion and decreasing water dissolved ch4 concentrations thereby presenting low ch4 fluxes ho et al 2016 brankovits and pohlman 2020 compared to other estuaries the high water velocity may also be an important factor favoring low ch4 fluxes in the jx and mlx estuaries subsequently the large effects of hydrologic conditions on ch4 emissions suggest that the estuaries should be properly classified based on the hydrologic characteristics when upscaling ch4 fluxes for global estuaries 4 3 estuary ch4 sources and controls the large variations in estuary ch4 emissions with human activity intensity gradient reflected that ch4 production processes differ across the estuaries rosentreter et al 2018 wells et al 2020 in the minimally and moderately impacted estuaries the δ 13c ch4 values were more negative varying from 102 to 64 across the sampled waters which could be due to the dominance of ch4 production from co2 reduction corbett et al 2013 huang and hall 2018 high αapp values increasing from 1 049 to 1 096 further confirmed that the ch4 production is primarily produced by the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in both the minimally and moderately impacted estuaries 95 occurrence frequency the other explanation may be that low labile organic c in benthic sediments drives the hydrogenotrophic pathway to produce ch4 flury and ulseth 2019 causing low ch4 emissions in the estuaries under low and moderate human activity intensity conditions however the δ 13c ch4 values fell between 70 7 and 46 3 and the αapp were in a range of 1 025 1 064 in the highly impacted estuaries meaning that the ch4 production is produced by the acetoclastic methanogenesis because this pathway can be favored under the labile c enriched conditions rosentreter et al 2018 flury and ulseth 2019 the dominance of ch4 production from the acetoclastic pathway in the highly impacted estuaries 70 95 occurrence frequency can be supported by the high doc concentrations in benthic sediments increasing anaerobic ch4 production figure 7 the αapp decreased significantly from 1 082 in the minimally impacted estuaries to 1 074 in the moderately impacted estuaries and then to 1 046 in the highly impacted estuaries fig 4 further suggesting the certain switch of the ch4 production pathways across the human activity intensity gradient notably the δ 13c ch4 signatures in the five studied estuaries were generally higher in the wet than dry seasons which may support the intensive oxidation of ch4 in the wet season because ch4 oxidation can increase the 13c of residual ch4 huang and hall 2018 flury and ulseth 2019 brankovits and pohlman 2020 the decreases in ch4 fluxes from the freshwater endmember to estuary mouth in the five estuaries could also suggest that labile organic c decreases from the freshwater endmember to the estuary mouth likely favoring hydrogenotrophic ch4 production towards the estuary mouth it is therefore most likely that the δ 13c ch4 and αapp differences between the estuaries reflect the c cycle differences and the change in labile organic c from the minimally to highly impacted estuaries with increasing human activity intensity the increases in nutrient and organic c inputs can increase biological oxygen consumption triggering the anaerobic conditions further favoring anaerobic ch4 production wang et al 2021 in addition the evidence that more labile organic c is created by eutrophication beaulieu et al 2019 combined with low water dissolved oxygen would fuelch4 production due to energetically favorable biological c decomposition of methanogenic microorganisms under anaerobic conditions parkes et al 2012 zhou et al 2019 the ratio of c ch4 oc positively increased with the increasing n levels in the highly impacted estuaries whereas there were no relationships between them in the minimally and moderately impacted estuaries fig 5 reflecting that eutrophic systems present high ch4 production and become increasingly important in ch4 emissions beaulieu et al 2019 relative to freshwater environments the high so4 2 reduction coupled with ch4 oxidation in estuarine and coastal sediments chuang et al 2016 may contribute to the decline of water ch4 fluxes towards the estuary mouth this may also drive the spatial variations of ch4 flux regardless of the labile organic c decrease along the estuary rosentreter et al 2018 we also used the multiple stepwise regression models to demonstrate that water velocity suspended sediment tn temperature salinity and doc could predict the dynamics of ch4 fluxes across the estuaries and seasons adj r 2 0 63 p 0 001 meanwhile tn t 3 1 69 and temperature t 4 4 29 were positively correlated with ch4 fluxes table s2 further confirming that ch4 emissions would increase under eutrophication and global climate warming scenarios it has been reported that groundwater and wastewater are the important sources of water ch4 in estuarine environments sadat noori et al 2016 rosentreter et al 2018 other studies documented that the significantly positive relationship between doc and 222rn concentrations supported the importance of groundwater to surface water ch4 sadat noori et al 2016 however there was a negative relationship between them throughout the five estuaries fig 6 a 6b although groundwater is rich in ch4 and can increase surface water ch4 sadat noori et al 2016 rosentreter et al 2018 only a positive relationship was observed between water 222rn and ch4 concentrations in the dry season fig 6 furthermore we may constrain the ch4 fluxes from the groundwater contributing surface water ch4 emissions by determining surface water 222rn concentrations we thus used the ratios of ch4 to 222rn nmol ch4 dpm 222rn to enable the groundwater to fill the gap in estuary ch4 fluxes the ch4 222rn ratios varied between 63 and 122 in the minimally impacted estuaries between 43 and 201 in the moderately impacted estuaries and between 100 and 455 in the highly impacted estuaries which were much higher than the range of 1 7 previously reported in the shallow aquifers where groundwater dominated the source of surface water ch4 sadat noori et al 2016 this comparison could indicate that groundwater inputs only contribute little to surface water ch4 fluxes in the five studied estuaries the significant effects of wastewater on ch4 source in the highly impacted estuaries were undermined by the fact that the ch4 fluxes were much lower in the mj than those in the jj and jlj even though there are more sewage outlets along the mj table s1 as well the significant relationships between sediment doc contents and water ch4 concentrations in the wet and dry seasons likely suggest that internal ch4 production not the external inputs is critical for estuary ch4 emissions wells et al 2020 wang et al 2021 therefore groundwater and wastewater inputs could not fully explain the variations in surface water ch4 emissions in the studied estuaries 4 4 implications for estuary ch4 emissions estuary ch4 emissions are substantially responsible for global climate warming potential with human activity intensity increases ipcc 2013 wells et al 2020 in this study the warming potential of estuary ch4 emissions increased fivefold from the minimally 137 µg co2 equivalents m 2h 1 to highly 740 µg co2 equivalents m 2h 1 impacted estuaries in terms of co2 balance in estuaries the emissions of water ch4 in co2 equiv acquired from the studied estuaries could offset approximately1 6 of the average co2 sink found in china estuaries 32 mg co2 m 2h 1 yi 2017 these results suggest that estuaries may play an important role in climate warming and that estuary ch4 emissions would be amplified under increasing human activity intensity human modifications of estuary environments cloern et al 2016 wells et al 2020 mean that the increase in estuary ch4 emission driven by human activity is crucial for upscaling ch4 fluxes from global estuaries with important implications on global c budgets the hydrologic conditions primarily modify seasonal variations in ch4 emissions within the estuary by altering biogeochemical factors for benthic ch4 production wells et al 2020 and gas transfer velocity ho et al 2016 rosentreter et al 2017 which further causes the uncertainties in quantifying ch4 emissions the estuaries with different hydrological characteristics can also present different capacity systems of areal ch4 emissions rosentreter et al 2018 therefore hydrologic conditions that possibly drive the alterations of estuary ch4 emissions should be also considered in projecting ch4 emissions from global estuaries diffusion is the molecular transport of ch4 after being oxidized in water column whereas ebullition emits ch4 to the atmosphere directly delsontro et al 2015 it is known that ebullition can be the dominant emission pathway possibly contributing over 90 of the total emitted ch4 from some aquatic systems crawford et al 2014 sawakuchi et al 2014 delsontro et al 2015 wang et al 2021 total ch4 emissions from our studied estuaries are thus underestimated as we did not measure ebullition the reason is that the ebullition of ch4 is expected to be higher in the high human impacted estuaries because high organic carbon can trigger acetoclastic ch4 formation in addition low oxygen or anoxic conditions in the highly impacted systems can further fuel ch4 production possibly corresponding to more ebullition of ch4 compared to the minimally impacted systems wang et al 2021 future work should include ebullitive estimates as they are required for better projections of estuarine ch4 emissions under climate change and other relevant human activities 5 conclusion water dissolved ch4 concentrations and fluxes in the estuaries increased significantly with increasing human activity intensity there were significant seasonal variations of water ch4 concentrations and fluxes high discharge and water flow could decrease estuary areal ch4 emissions although the estuaries were consistently and strongly affected by human activity an increase in δ 13c ch4 value from the minimally to highly impacted estuaries was accompanied by a switch from the hydrogenotrophic to acetoclastic pathways of ch4 production the ratios of c ch4 oc were much higher in the highly impacted estuaries confirming that eutrophic estuaries present high ch4 production capacity these results suggest that human activity intensity and hydrologic conditions together modify the processes and magnitudes of ch4 production

3163,nutrient loading caused by human activities can drive changes in methane ch4 production pathways yet the mechanisms and magnitudes of estuary ch4 emissions remain poorly understood here we investigated ch4 fluxes and δ 13c ch4 values in wet and dry seasons from five subtropical estuaries with varying human activity intensity and hydrologic conditions water dissolved ch4 concentrations varied from 0 19 to 0 51 µmol ch4 l 1 in these studied estuaries resulting in coincident water air ch4 fluxes ranging from 5 46 to 29 6 µg ch4 m 2h 1 water ch4 concentrations and fluxes were significantly lower in the wet than dry season and were higher in the high human impacted estuaries indicating that large discharge and water flow could slow down areal ch4 emissions the ratios of c ch4 to organic carbon oc were much higher and showed a positive response to increasing nitrogen concentrations in high human impacted estuaries suggesting that eutrophic estuaries trigger high ch4 emissions in addition an increase in δ 13c ch4 and a declining in fractionation factor α app from the low to high human impacted estuaries were accompanied by a switch of ch4 production from hydrogenotrophic to acetoclastic pathways these results suggest that human activity intensity can drive the alterations in the pathways and magnitudes of ch4 production and that hydrologic conditions can modify ch4 emissions which have important implications for estimates of ch4 emissions from global estuaries under increasing human activity intensity keywords methane hydrologic characteristics human activity eutrophication climate warming subtropical estuary 1 introduction methane ch4 an important greenhouse gas contributes about 20 of global radiative forcing ipcc 2013 and thus plays an important role in global climate warming kirschke et al 2013 estuaries are increasingly recognized as a significant contributor to the global carbon cycle and greenhouse gas emissions borges and abril 2011 bauer et al 2013 and account for 3 of ch4 emission from natural sources borges and abril 2011 ch4 production is highly dependent on temperature yvon durocher et al 2014 wik et al 2014 oxygen concentration steinle et al 2017 and organic carbon quality romeijn et al 2019 thus leading to a large variation in ch4 emissions across diverse aquatic ecosystems kirschke et al 2013 sawakuchi et al 2014 crawford et al 2017 rosentreter et al 2017 therefore estuary ch4 emissions become increasingly important in the context of global climate warming and human activity cloern et al 2016 cotovicz et al 2016 beaulieu et al 2019 wells et al 2020 numerous studies examined the spatial and temporal variations of estuary ch4 emissions cotovicz et al 2016 rosentreter et al 2017 crucial uncertainties however still exist in terms of estuary ch4 production pathways and emission magnitudes in response to varying human activity intensity which can trigger large constraints on the projections of ch4 emissions from global estuaries ch4 is primarily produced from organic molecule decomposition acetoclastic pathway or co2 reduction hydrogenotrophic pathway under anaerobic conditions flury and ulseth 2019 but their importance to ch4 production is highly variable in different aquatic environments in oligotrophic environments ch4 production is derived mainly from co2 reduction due to limited energy for methanogens stegen et al 2018 large inputs of nutrient from human activity can intensify oxygen consumption and exacerbate water eutrophication which in return increases labile organic matter production high availability and quality of organic matter combined with low dissolved oxygen conditions can dramatically trigger anaerobic ch4 production cloern et al 2016 beaulieu et al 2019 consequently estuary ch4 production could be switched from hydrogenotrophic to acetoclastic pathways when human activity intensifies it should be noted that ch4 production and consumption can cause 13c fractionation whiticar 1999 it is known that 13c can be depleted in ch4 production whereas ch4 oxidation increases δ 13c ch4 conrad 1999 whiticar 1999 in addition acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic pathways have quite different δ 13c ch4 values whiticar 1999 huang and hall 2018 therefore an apparent fractionation factor αapp between δ 13c co2 and δ 13c ch4 can distinguish major ch4 production pathway in natural environments whiticar 1999 conrad 2005 hydrologic conditions can also provide additional constraints water residence time for benthic ch4 production or water column ch4 oxidation on ch4 emission in estuaries rosentreter et al 2018 wells et al 2020 hydrologic changes between the wet and dry seasons can affect ch4 production and emission by altering biogeochemical factors for benthic ch4 production and gas transfer velocity ho et al 2016 rosentreter et al 2017 in addition dissolved oxygen concentrations affected by water residence time have great influence on ch4 production and oxidation rosentreter et al 2018 flury and ulseth 2019 subsequently resulting in different ch4 emissions large water discharge and high water turbulence can increase ch4 emission rosentreter et al 2018 groundwater contributes largely to ch4 emissions in mangrove dominated estuaries dutta et al 2015 rosentreter et al 2018 and small estuaries surrounded by wetlands sadat noori et al 2016 their importance to surface water ch4 dynamics in estuaries spanning hydrologic condition gradients is yet to be validated therefore there is a large knowledge gap about how the differences and changes in hydrologic conditions modify estuary ch4 emission the objective of this study was to determine the mechanisms and magnitudes of estuary ch4 emissions driven by different human activity intensities and hydrologic conditions we hypothesized that estuary ch4 emissions would increase with the increasing human activity intensity and will be higher in dry than wet seasons which could be due to long water residence time and low dissolved oxygen conditions favoring biological ch4 production and higher methanogenic substrate availability promoting anaerobic acetoclastic pathway of ch4 production we tested this hypothesis by seasonal measurements of ch 4 concentrations fluxes and isotopic δ 13c ch4 compositions in five subtropical estuaries with varying human activity intensity and hydrologic conditions this study can improve understanding of mechanisms underlying ch4 production and emission in estuarine environments 2 material and methods 2 1 study area in this study field surveys were carried out in five subtropical estuaries in fujian province of southeast china in may 2019 and june 2020 wet seasons and october 2019 and october 2020 dry seasons figure s1 mean annual temperature and precipitation range from 18 1 to 21 4 c and from 1231 to 1450 mm while the majority of precipitation falls between march and september these selected estuaries subsequently referred to by their river names encompass different hydrologic characteristics and human activity intensity table 1 min river is characterized by the greatest length and catchment area and mulan river exhibits the lowest discharge and catchment area human activity intensity was defined by the city population and sewage outlets along the estuaries corresponding to differences in nitrogen loading table 1

collection and measurements water and gas samples were collected in triplicate from five sites along the salinity gradient within each estuary all samples were collected through the main channel under the duration of high tide surface water was pumped from 20 cm water depth and stored in a 50 ml gas tight glass serum bottle with no headspace and was then immediately preserved by adding 100 µl of saturated hgcl2 to stop microbial activity another 500 ml of water was sampled with polyethylene bottles for measuringt of water parameters benthic sediments were collected using a grab bucket air gas

laboratory within 6 h 222rn concentrations of surface water were measured using a radon analyzer rad7 durridge air temperature wind speed and atmospheric pressure at 1 m above the water surface were

dissolved organic carbon doc in sediments was extracted via deionized water total nitrogen tn and doc in surface water and sediments were measured using a toc analyzer toc vcph shimadzu kyoto japan po4 3 p was determined with a continuous flow nutrient autoanalyzer san plus skalar analytical b v 400 ml of water sample was filtered through gf f glass fiber filter whatman and the suspended particle on the filter was then weighed after drying 2 3 ch4 concentration and flux dissolved ch4 concentration in the water sample was determined by the headspace equilibrium technique wanninkhof 1992 briefly 20 ml of headspace was created by replacing the equal volume of ultrahigh purity helium and the bottle was then shaken vigorously for 30 min to keep the gas equilibrium between water and gas phases the ch4 in headspace gas was measured using a gas chromatograph gc 2014 shimadzu kyoto japan equipped with a flame ionization detector fid dissolved ch4 concentration was then calculated based on the bunsen solubility coefficient as a function of temperature and salinity wanninkhof 1992 farías et al 2017 water ch4 saturation relative to the atmospheric equilibrium was also determined cole et al 2010 diffusive ch4 flux across the water air interface is calculated using the thin boundary layer equation liss and slater 1974 flury and ulseth 2019 1 f w k x c w c eq m 1000 where f w is the ch4 flux µg m 2h 1 kx denotes the gas transfer velocity cm h 1 c w is the measured concentration of ch4 in water sample nmol l 1 c eq stands for water saturation of ch4 concentration nmol l 1 m represents the molar mass of ch4 16 g mol 1 the physical transfer of gas across the water air interface is empirically parameterized to account for wind speed borges abril 2011 wells et al 2018 we

t is the in situ measured water temperature oc 2 4 analysis and calculation of δ 13ch4 and α app water sample for analysis of δ 13c ch4 and δ 13c co2 was pumped at a water depth of 20 cm and stored in a 120 ml gas tight glass serum bottle the bottle was immediately preserved by adding 200 µl of saturated solution of hgcl2 without any bubbles headspace in the bottle was created by injecting 30 ml of ultrahigh purity helium the δ 13c ch4 and δ 13c co2 in headspace gas were determined using an isotope ratio mass spectrometry thermo fisher delta v plus coupled to a gas chromatograph the 13c 12c ratios of ch4 and co2 are referenced to the standard vienna pee dee belemnite vpdb carbon stable isotopes of co2 and ch4 are converted to standard δ 13c notation and reported in per mile given that carbon cycling and atmospheric ch4 can affect the water δ 13c a two pool mixing equation was used to calibrate the measured δ 13c ch4 wells et al 2020 8 δ 13 c c h 4 δ 13 c c h 4 mix c mia δ 13 c c h 4 atmos c atmos c mix c atmos where c mix is the measured dissolved water ch4 concentration δ 13c ch4 mix is the dissolved water ch4 isotopic composition c atmos is the water ch4 concentration at 100 atmospheric saturation and δ 13c ch4 atmos denotes the isotopic composition 47 of atmospheric ch4 whiticar 1999 the δ 13c ch4 values from the acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic pathways varied between 32 and 70 valentine et al 2004 huang and hall 2018 and between 55 and 115 corbett et al 2013 huang and hall 2018 respectively the ch4 production can cause the 13c depletion whereas ch4 oxidation increases δ 13c ch4 and decreases δ 13c co2 huang and hall 2018 therefore the fractionation factor α app which is calculated by the ratio between δ 13c co2 and δ 13c ch4 could actually determine the ch4 production pathways conrad 2005 rosentreter et al 2018 flury and ulseth 2019 the α app is estimated according to the below equation conrad 2005 9 α app δ 13 c c o 2 1000 δ 13 c c h 4 1000 where δ 13c co2 and δ 13c ch4 are the isotopic compositions of δ 13c co2 and δ 13c ch4 respectively to distinguish ch4 production between the acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic pathways a threshold value of 1 055 is used for α app as suggested by whiticar 1999 and flury and ulseth 2019 here the α app value 1 055 indicates that co2 reduction is the dominant methanogenic process whereas the α app value 1 055 suggests that the acetoclastic pathway is the dominant methanogenic process 2 5 statistical analysis significant differences in hydrologic variables and ch4 emissions rates across the different seasons and estuaries were examined using two way anova analysis multiple comparisons of δ 13c ch4 δ 13c co2 and αapp between the estuaries were performed using tukey s least significant difference method the best models for explaining the variations in water ch4 concentration saturation and flux were identified using stepwise regression analysis statistical analyses were conducted using spss software version 22 0 spss inc chicago il usa and a p value 0 05 was considered statistically significant for all tests 3 results 3 1 hydrographical characteristics water discharge ranged largely from

the dry season of 2020 in the jx estuary the ch4 fluxes did not differ among the diffusion models p 0 05 table 3 in addition the average ch4 fluxes of the five models were comparable with the fluxes estimated by dmcl98 the ch4 fluxes estimated by dmcl98 were conservatively used in the subsequent results fig 2e 2f ch4 fluxes ranged from 1 51 to 40 5 µg m 2h 1 across these estuaries and seasons the

not differ significantly between the wet and dry seasons f 7 2 p 0 05 the δ 13c co2 decreased from 11 5 in the minimally impacted estuaries to 13 4 in the moderately and highly impacted estuaries f 4

values decreased from 1 082 in the minimally impacted estuaries to 1 074 in the moderately impacted estuaries and then to 1 046 in the highly impacted estuaries f 122 p 0 001 and were also higher in the dry than wet seasons f 13 0 p 0 01 in the minimally and moderately impacted estuaries the α app for all the sampled water indicated that ch4 was mainly produced from hydrogenotrophic pathway 95 fig 4 the majority 70 95 of αapp in collected water from the highly impacted estuaries was indicative for acetoclastic ch4 production whereas 5 30 was attributed to the hydrogenotrophic process the ratios of c ch4 to organic carbon c ch4 oc in water samples ranged from 0 14 to 3 27 10 3 fig 5 and the average was higher in the highly impacted estuaries than in the minimally and moderately impacted estuaries p 0 001 the ratios of c ch4 oc positively increased as nitrogen increase in the highly impacted estuaries r 2 0 22 p 0 001 it should be noted however that there were no significant relationships between them in the minimally and moderately impacted estuaries fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 spatial variability of estuary ch4 emissions numerous studies reported increasing magnitudes of water dissolved ch4 concentrations and water air fluxes in estuaries with increasing human activity intensity in this study it was observed that water dissolved ch4 concentrations increased significantly from 0 14 to 0 66 µmol l 1 across these estuaries as human activity intensity increased the mj jj and jlj estuaries with high human activity intensity presented high ch4 concentrations which were 2 3 times higher than those in the minimally impacted estuaries these five studied estuaries were oversaturated in ch4 presenting large potential ch4 emissions in addition high water ch4 concentrations led to corresponding high ch4 saturations fig 2c 2d suggesting that ch4 concentration level is critical for estuary ch4 emission capacity wells et al 2020 we found that water dissolved ch4 concentrations in the five studied estuaries were one order of magnitude higher than those in fitzroy river and constant creek estuaries from 26 to 53 nmol l 1 rosentreter et al 2018 but were comparable to johnstone river estuary from 0 18 to 0 42 µmol l 1 rosentreter et al 2018 and brisbane river estuary from 0 03 to 0 58 µmol l 1 musenze et al 2014 which are both strongly affected by nutrient loading and human activity however the water ch4 concentrations varied from 12 to 40 nmol l 1 in the eight subtropical estuaries of se queensland wells et al 2020 which were much lower than those in our studied estuaries although the eight subtropical estuaries in se queensland presented a land use gradient wells et al 2020 the n concentrations in these estuaries tn 0 31 0 97 mg l 1 were much lower than those in the five studied estuaries tn 0 64 5 59 mg l 1 further confirming that human activity intensity and nutrient loading control the water ch4 concentrations in the human impacted estuaries water air ch4 fluxes increased significantly with increasing human activity intensity corresponding to the water ch4 concentrations across the five estuaries the ch4 fluxes in the five estuaries 5 46 35 6 µg ch4 m 2h 1 estimated by the dmcl98 model were consistent with the eight subtropical estuaries spanning land use gradient in se queensland of australia 6 5 34 5 µg ch4 m 2h 1 wells et al 2020 we also found that the estuary ch4 fluxes of these studies were much lower than those in urban rivers of beijing 2 2 mg ch4 m 2h 1 wang et al 2021 and global mean of streams and rivers 5 5 mg ch4 m 2h 1 stanley et al 2016 therefore human activity intensity and nutrient loading drive the differences of water ch4 fluxes in the estuaries shifting from the low to high ch4 emissions with increasing human activity intensity these results suggest that the positive relationship between eutrophication and ch4 fluxes established for freshwater environments stanley et al 2016 beaulieu et al 2019 may hold for the estuaries in addition the evidence that estuary ch4 emissions would become intense under increasing human activity intensity has great uncertainty in projecting ch4 fluxes of global estuaries in the future since global change and human activity would strongly affect the ecological functions of estuaries cloern et al 2016 the ch4 fluxes calculated from ch4 concentrations are uncertain which could be mainly attributed to the kx values wells et al 2020 the interactions of winds water currents and tides can affect surface water turbulence and gas evasion causing the fundamental uncertainties in kx value calculations ho et al 2016 the large differences in kx values would cause differences in the ch4 fluxes borges abril 2011 which may in return lead to a large uncertainty of the upscaling ch4 emissions however we could not address this gap as it is well beyond the scope of this study notably we compared the ch4 fluxes under the previously reported diffusion models to highlight that kx is better for estimating ch4 fluxes in studied estuaries we found that the kx values varied greatly among the dmw92a dmrc01 dmcl98 dmmy95 and dmcw03 models table 3 however the ch4 fluxes were not significantly variable although there were differences in ch4 fluxes among the diffusion modes in addition the average ch4 fluxes of these five diffusion models were consistent with the fluxes estimated by the dmcl98 model strongly suggesting that the kx of dmcl98 model is critical for ch4 estimation in these estuaries these uncertainties in our ch4 flux estimations emphasize the necessity to standardize how estuary k values are parameterized and highlight the difficulty in comparing estuary ch4 fluxes with previous studies 4 2 estuary ch4 emissions associated with hydrologic conditions hydrologic conditions can affect estuary ch4 emissions because ch4 production and diffusion are greatly affected by these conditions ho et al 2016 rosentreter et al 2017 rosentreter et al 2018 in this study across the three highly impacted estuaries we found that the ch4 fluxes were much lower in the mj than in the jj and jlj estuaries although the mj is a highly impacted estuary water tn and po4 3 p concentrations were much lower mostly because the mj is characterized by the largest discharge and water flow minimizing nutrients concentrations however the mlx as a moderately impacted and minimal discharge and water flow estuary presented a comparable ch4 fluxes with the jx in addition high water turbidity in the mlx could also inhibit the high nutrient from fueling biological growth and further decrease labile c for ch4 production which could be attributed to the poor productivity and photodegradation cory and kling 2018 wells et al 2020 we also found that the ch4 fluxes were significantly lower in the wet than dry seasons which was most likely due to the high water flow weakening benthic ch4 production and decreasing the ch4 residence time rosentreter et al 2018 wells et al 2020 it has also been reported that high water flow can decrease the water residence time so there is not enough time for biogeochemical c reactions and breaking the favorable conditions for ch4 production borges et al 2018 rosentreter et al 2018 the differences in water velocities between the estuaries can drive the variations of ch4 diffusion capacity with high water velocity increasing ch4 diffusion and decreasing water dissolved ch4 concentrations thereby presenting low ch4 fluxes ho et al 2016 brankovits and pohlman 2020 compared to other estuaries the high water velocity may also be an important factor favoring low ch4 fluxes in the jx and mlx estuaries subsequently the large effects of hydrologic conditions on ch4 emissions suggest that the estuaries should be properly classified based on the hydrologic characteristics when upscaling ch4 fluxes for global estuaries 4 3 estuary ch4 sources and controls the large variations in estuary ch4 emissions with human activity intensity gradient reflected that ch4 production processes differ across the estuaries rosentreter et al 2018 wells et al 2020 in the minimally and moderately impacted estuaries the δ 13c ch4 values were more negative varying from 102 to 64 across the sampled waters which could be due to the dominance of ch4 production from co2 reduction corbett et al 2013 huang and hall 2018 high αapp values increasing from 1 049 to 1 096 further confirmed that the ch4 production is primarily produced by the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in both the minimally and moderately impacted estuaries 95 occurrence frequency the other explanation may be that low labile organic c in benthic sediments drives the hydrogenotrophic pathway to produce ch4 flury and ulseth 2019 causing low ch4 emissions in the estuaries under low and moderate human activity intensity conditions however the δ 13c ch4 values fell between 70 7 and 46 3 and the αapp were in a range of 1 025 1 064 in the highly impacted estuaries meaning that the ch4 production is produced by the acetoclastic methanogenesis because this pathway can be favored under the labile c enriched conditions rosentreter et al 2018 flury and ulseth 2019 the dominance of ch4 production from the acetoclastic pathway in the highly impacted estuaries 70 95 occurrence frequency can be supported by the high doc concentrations in benthic sediments increasing anaerobic ch4 production figure 7 the αapp decreased significantly from 1 082 in the minimally impacted estuaries to 1 074 in the moderately impacted estuaries and then to 1 046 in the highly impacted estuaries fig 4 further suggesting the certain switch of the ch4 production pathways across the human activity intensity gradient notably the δ 13c ch4 signatures in the five studied estuaries were generally higher in the wet than dry seasons which may support the intensive oxidation of ch4 in the wet season because ch4 oxidation can increase the 13c of residual ch4 huang and hall 2018 flury and ulseth 2019 brankovits and pohlman 2020 the decreases in ch4 fluxes from the freshwater endmember to estuary mouth in the five estuaries could also suggest that labile organic c decreases from the freshwater endmember to the estuary mouth likely favoring hydrogenotrophic ch4 production towards the estuary mouth it is therefore most likely that the δ 13c ch4 and αapp differences between the estuaries reflect the c cycle differences and the change in labile organic c from the minimally to highly impacted estuaries with increasing human activity intensity the increases in nutrient and organic c inputs can increase biological oxygen consumption triggering the anaerobic conditions further favoring anaerobic ch4 production wang et al 2021 in addition the evidence that more labile organic c is created by eutrophication beaulieu et al 2019 combined with low water dissolved oxygen would fuelch4 production due to energetically favorable biological c decomposition of methanogenic microorganisms under anaerobic conditions parkes et al 2012 zhou et al 2019 the ratio of c ch4 oc positively increased with the increasing n levels in the highly impacted estuaries whereas there were no relationships between them in the minimally and moderately impacted estuaries fig 5 reflecting that eutrophic systems present high ch4 production and become increasingly important in ch4 emissions beaulieu et al 2019 relative to freshwater environments the high so4 2 reduction coupled with ch4 oxidation in estuarine and coastal sediments chuang et al 2016 may contribute to the decline of water ch4 fluxes towards the estuary mouth this may also drive the spatial variations of ch4 flux regardless of the labile organic c decrease along the estuary rosentreter et al 2018 we also used the multiple stepwise regression models to demonstrate that water velocity suspended sediment tn temperature salinity and doc could predict the dynamics of ch4 fluxes across the estuaries and seasons adj r 2 0 63 p 0 001 meanwhile tn t 3 1 69 and temperature t 4 4 29 were positively correlated with ch4 fluxes table s2 further confirming that ch4 emissions would increase under eutrophication and global climate warming scenarios it has been reported that groundwater and wastewater are the important sources of water ch4 in estuarine environments sadat noori et al 2016 rosentreter et al 2018 other studies documented that the significantly positive relationship between doc and 222rn concentrations supported the importance of groundwater to surface water ch4 sadat noori et al 2016 however there was a negative relationship between them throughout the five estuaries fig 6 a 6b although groundwater is rich in ch4 and can increase surface water ch4 sadat noori et al 2016 rosentreter et al 2018 only a positive relationship was observed between water 222rn and ch4 concentrations in the dry season fig 6 furthermore we may constrain the ch4 fluxes from the groundwater contributing surface water ch4 emissions by determining surface water 222rn concentrations we thus used the ratios of ch4 to 222rn nmol ch4 dpm 222rn to enable the groundwater to fill the gap in estuary ch4 fluxes the ch4 222rn ratios varied between 63 and 122 in the minimally impacted estuaries between 43 and 201 in the moderately impacted estuaries and between 100 and 455 in the highly impacted estuaries which were much higher than the range of 1 7 previously reported in the shallow aquifers where groundwater dominated the source of surface water ch4 sadat noori et al 2016 this comparison could indicate that groundwater inputs only contribute little to surface water ch4 fluxes in the five studied estuaries the significant effects of wastewater on ch4 source in the highly impacted estuaries were undermined by the fact that the ch4 fluxes were much lower in the mj than those in the jj and jlj even though there are more sewage outlets along the mj table s1 as well the significant relationships between sediment doc contents and water ch4 concentrations in the wet and dry seasons likely suggest that internal ch4 production not the external inputs is critical for estuary ch4 emissions wells et al 2020 wang et al 2021 therefore groundwater and wastewater inputs could not fully explain the variations in surface water ch4 emissions in the studied estuaries 4 4 implications for estuary ch4 emissions estuary ch4 emissions are substantially responsible for global climate warming potential with human activity intensity increases ipcc 2013 wells et al 2020 in this study the warming potential of estuary ch4 emissions increased fivefold from the minimally 137 µg co2 equivalents m 2h 1 to highly 740 µg co2 equivalents m 2h 1 impacted estuaries in terms of co2 balance in estuaries the emissions of water ch4 in co2 equiv acquired from the studied estuaries could offset approximately1 6 of the average co2 sink found in china estuaries 32 mg co2 m 2h 1 yi 2017 these results suggest that estuaries may play an important role in climate warming and that estuary ch4 emissions would be amplified under increasing human activity intensity human modifications of estuary environments cloern et al 2016 wells et al 2020 mean that the increase in estuary ch4 emission driven by human activity is crucial for upscaling ch4 fluxes from global estuaries with important implications on global c budgets the hydrologic conditions primarily modify seasonal variations in ch4 emissions within the estuary by altering biogeochemical factors for benthic ch4 production wells et al 2020 and gas transfer velocity ho et al 2016 rosentreter et al 2017 which further causes the uncertainties in quantifying ch4 emissions the estuaries with different hydrological characteristics can also present different capacity systems of areal ch4 emissions rosentreter et al 2018 therefore hydrologic conditions that possibly drive the alterations of estuary ch4 emissions should be also considered in projecting ch4 emissions from global estuaries diffusion is the molecular transport of ch4 after being oxidized in water column whereas ebullition emits ch4 to the atmosphere directly delsontro et al 2015 it is known that ebullition can be the dominant emission pathway possibly contributing over 90 of the total emitted ch4 from some aquatic systems crawford et al 2014 sawakuchi et al 2014 delsontro et al 2015 wang et al 2021 total ch4 emissions from our studied estuaries are thus underestimated as we did not measure ebullition the reason is that the ebullition of ch4 is expected to be higher in the high human impacted estuaries because high organic carbon can trigger acetoclastic ch4 formation in addition low oxygen or anoxic conditions in the highly impacted systems can further fuel ch4 production possibly corresponding to more ebullition of ch4 compared to the minimally impacted systems wang et al 2021 future work should include ebullitive estimates as they are required for better projections of estuarine ch4 emissions under climate change and other relevant human activities 5 conclusion water dissolved ch4 concentrations and fluxes in the estuaries increased significantly with increasing human activity intensity there were significant seasonal variations of water ch4 concentrations and fluxes high discharge and water flow could decrease estuary areal ch4 emissions although the estuaries were consistently and strongly affected by human activity an increase in δ 13c ch4 value from the minimally to highly impacted estuaries was accompanied by a switch from the hydrogenotrophic to acetoclastic pathways of ch4 production the ratios of c ch4 oc were much higher in the highly impacted estuaries confirming that eutrophic estuaries present high ch4 production capacity these results suggest that human activity intensity and hydrologic conditions together modify the processes and magnitudes of ch4 production

terrain is low and flat and the drainage is relatively restricted the sediments are mainly composed of fine silts and sands and are characterized by moderate permeability slow runoff and little

while the reservoir water can flow into dlj from the outlet sluice from 2007 to 2015 the discharge data of the dlj at the outlet between r1 and s1 fig 1 show that the average monthly flow of the dlj

fertilizer cf sewage and manure sw m were determined detailed in table s1 3 results 3 1 the spatial and temporal variation of water chemistry parameters in cz the cz in tianjin was formed by river sedimentation seawater intrusion and multiple transgression events meng et al 2009 supported by the hydrochemistry of samples the seasonal variation in water chemistry parameters is shown in fig s 3c

the do in the summer july and august were lower than that in spring and winter april and november han et al 2021 the ph variation of all samples ranged from 7 5 to 9 3 with an average value of 8 5 0 3 fig s3 in terms of spatial variation the ec showed a significant salinity gradient ranging from 0 5 to 50 1 ms cm fig s3 a of which the upstream and midstream had a mean value of 1 8 0 9 ms cm and 7 5 10 2 ms cm respectively downstream average 25 7 15 4 ms cm and seawater 46 2 3 2 ms cm exhibited relatively high ec piper figure and gibbs figure can visualize the hydrochemical facies and the factors controlling water chemistry gibbs 1970 roy et al 2022 fig 2 a illustrates that the hydrochemical facies calculated as the proportion of the total anions and cations giménez forcada 2019 showed little temporal variations but significant spatial differences fig 2 a and fig s4 the water type from the upstream to the downstream gradually transitioned from hco3 so4 cl ca na mg into the cl so4 na mg type and evolved into cl na type water at the downstream i e decreasing ca2 and increasing na and cl owing to the gradually increase seawater contribution fig 2 b and c the impact of human engineering factors e g dam building was evaluated using the δr re ec value i e river s ec value minus reservoir s ec value during the sampling period four sample sets r2 re1 r3 re2 r4 re3 r7 re6 were chosen to assess the impact effect of artificial dams for example the average value of δr re ec was 0 1 1 4 ms cm during the dam opening period and was 30 7 4 8 ms cm during the dams closing period fig s5 indicating that artificial sluices could effectively prevent the intrusion of seawater into the reservoir water in the study area this result demonstrated that the management of dams could influence the water chemical components in present weak hydrological cz rivers the seawater fraction f provided information on the spatially affected vary by seawater abou zakhem and hafez 2007 based on equation 2 the average f value was 44 1 32 3 downstream which was higher than the downstream of yellow river 7 7 8 8 fan et al 2014 the f value decreased to 11 0 22 3 in midstream and changed little upstream 0 1 1 8 indicating that this cz is severely affected by seawater intrusion moreover the reservoir water was less affected than the midstream at 5 2 4 1 owing to artificial dams fig 3 3 2 isotopic compositions δ18o δd of water the water stable isotope values in the study area ranged from 72 3 to 6 0 for δd mean 30 3 16 2 n 101 and from 9 5 to 1 6 for δ18o h2o mean 2 7 2 8 n 101 fig 3 seasonal changes are shown in fig s6 water isotope data showed similar trends with the local meteoric water line lmwl zhang et al 2017 in contrast all surface water isotope compositions approached the lmwl and were situated in the lower right fig 3 with linear fitting performance on the test results the correlation is significant δd 5 6 δ18o 15 2 n 101 r2 0 94 p 0 01 in terms of spatial distribution salinity concentration gradually increases to the coastline fig 4 a the water isotope values appeared in a similar trend fig 4 b c consistent with the basis for the subdivision of the river between upstream and downstream the d excess is an important indicator of the relationship between hydrogen and oxygen isotopes indicating the atmospheric humidity of the water vapor source and the hydrological environment such as the process of regional evaporation and fractionation araguás araguás et al 1998 cui and li 2015 tian et al 2007 the d excess calculated by d excess δd 8 δ18o varied from 25 1 to 6 9 with a mean value of 8 5 7 9 fig 4 d july had the lowest d excess value average july br 14 9 5 7 and average july ar 14 9 5 0 april had the highest d excess average value of 2 9 6 0 3 3 n concentration and isotopic composition no3 n was the main component in the study area with an average value of 0 4 0 6 mg l and a maximum value of 2 9 mg l fig s7 the average no2 n was 0 05 0 2 mg l the maximum value 1 36 mg l fig s7 and 32 samples were below the detection limit 0 005 mg l the average value of nh4 n was 0 1 0 3 mg l and the maximum value was 1 43 mg l fig s7 the average value of δ15n no3 was 11 8 4 5 with a range of 4 7 20 7 the average value of δ18o no3 was 7 3 6 6 ranging from 2 3 to 25 3 fig 5 however the distribution of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 isotopes in the study area was more heterogeneous the samples in april had the lowest value of δ15n no3 average δ15n no3 7 7 3 1 and average δ18o no3 10 1 8 5 δ15n no3 in july and august average δ15n no3 11 4 4 0 was higher than in april november had the highest δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 with an average of 14 0 4 3 and 7 2 5 0 respectively c n ranged from 3 4 to 8 9 mean 4 8 1 2 n 40 which overlaps with the c n ratio of both phytoplankton 4 8 wissel et al 2005 and bacterioplankton 3 5 lehmann et al 2002 fig 6 the spatial variation of c n was small and the average c n of different water streams showed a slight decrease from 5 0 in upstream 4 5 in midstream to 4 2 in downstream the δ15n value of pon ranged from 0 1 to 18 0 mean 9 3 5 0 n 40 the mean of δ15n pon decreased from upstream 13 1 to downstream 10 8 however δ15n pon in waters showed a lower mean value in the reservoir samples 3 7 than in river water particularly in july br ranging from 2 4 to18 0 with an average of 11 7 it can be concluded that seasonal change had no noticeable effect on the distribution of δ15n pon 4 discussion 4 1 seawater intrusion and weathering determining water chemical components in cz the decreased mixing ratio of the seawater f obtained from equation 2 from downstream 44 32 through midstream 11 22 to upstream 0 1 2 further supports the influence of seawater intrusion on the properties of natural water in the study area fig 3 especially as an explanation of spatial variation due to the fragility of coastal ecosystems rising sea levels and changing climate seawater intrusion occurs in most coastal areas worldwide werner et al 2013 but the vast regional differences lead to uncertainty in the assessment of seawater intrusion compared with similar cz studies for example the highest f fraction in the essaouira basin was 16 ouhamdouch et al 2021 while the mean f value on the syrian coast north of latakia was 4 3 abou zakhem and hafez 2007 which were both of them below the present study average 16 30 hydrochemical studies of seawater intrusion can represent one extreme of the freshwater saltwater mixture but this mixing is superimposed with other processes pulido leboeuf 2004 the gibbs figure fig 2 b and c allows the contribution of two end members seawater and weathering to be explored li et al 2020 marandi and shand 2018 recognizing that most of the remaining water chemical components lie between these two end members also affected by the evaporation and precipitation process compared to other coastal rivers e g pearl river delta yangtze river estuary and the lower reaches of the yellow river the water composition of the study area was quite different fig s8 a and b for example the water chemistry of the pearl river delta li et al 2020 and the yangtze river estuary ding et al 2014 are substantially different from the seawater end member and the hydrochemical facies were mainly of the hco3 and so4 2 type which is primarily attributable to weathering however the water in the lower reaches of the yellow river fan et al 2014 and the tianjin cz area showed a certain degree of similarity it may be linked to the flat terrain and weak hydrodynamic conditions of the cz region in northern china represented by the yellow river delta and the present study area the apparent gradient of water isotopes from upstream to downstream demonstrated that varied water sources contributed from seawater and freshwater which also agreed with those obtained by the results of seawater fraction fig 3 in addition the relationship between the water isotope data and the lmwl further indicated the influence of the evaporation and precipitation process in the study area fig 3 the negative d excess value especially in the summer might further indicate that high altitude unbalanced vapor in the study area was mixed with saturated vapor near the seawater controlled by the summer monsoon shi et al 2021 however unlike the single variation of water isotopes with the distance from the coastal area the d excess variation was more irregular fig 4 d related to an unbalanced evaporation effect in the study area roy et al 2022 wu et al 2019 the linear mixing models show that many factors do ec t water isotopes and chemical components influenced the monthly samples and streams table s2 quantified using pca four principal components pcs were extracted via the pca method and explained 92 8 of the variance table s3 pc 1 and pc 2 explained 72 8 of the total variance fig 7 a among them pc 1 was 58 5 of the variance contribution rate of seven ion compositions and ec in the water body changing significantly under the influence of seawater intrusion downstream and weathering upstream fig 2 b and c huang et al 2013 jia et al 2012 so pc 1 was defined as the seawater intrusion and weathering factor siwf pc 2 was dominated by t ph and do with a variance contribution of 14 3 mainly determined by changes in the seasonal hydrochemical characteristics zhang et al 2012 it can be defined as the water quality seasonal factor wqsf pc 3 was correlated with water isotopes and had a variance contribution of 11 7 pc 4 was associated with total alkalinity and had a variance contribution of 8 3 table s2 pc 3 and pc 4 might be influenced by the evaporation and precipitation process probably due to the warm and semi humid continental monsoon climate the difference in water chemistry characteristics between april july and august was insignificant however there were apparent differences between these three months and november the former three months were affected to a similar extent by siwf and wqsf while the latter was influenced mainly by wqsf fig 7 b the spatial effects of siwf and wqsf on water quality parameters were more spatially significant siwf can determine the classification of different river streams upstream downstream with the eigenvalue of 7 6 and showed apparent changes in the horizontal axis fig 7 c this suggested that the siwf was the major factor influencing water quality parameters its influence was far more than wqsf the eigenvalue is 1 9 similar to other studies güler et al 2012 jia et al 2012 pc 3 and pc 4 with a combined contribution of 20 0 indicated that the influence of the evaporation and precipitation process should also be considered thus the results of pca showed four major factors that can be used as a quantitative reference frame for the cz water chemical properties 4 2 nitrogen processes seasonal changes in pon isotope values were not noticeable here fig 6 a but the δ15n pon of the river mean 11 7 was significantly higher than the δ15n pon of the reservoir mean 3 7 fig 6 b conceivably the higher value of δ15n pon might be due to industrial and domestic sewage contribution to the river while the reservoir had lower δ15n pon values under the influence of aquatic plants aravena et al 1993 compared with the n biogeochemical cycle organic matter degradation assimilation and absorption of the river the internal environment of the reservoir is more stable and the low c n and δ15n pon depleted organic matter is gradually released from the dominant position the contribution of 15n depleted bacterial biomass gradually increased lehmann et al 2002 the relationship between δ15n pon and c n shows that the pon in the reservoir mainly originated from bacterioplankton and phytoplankton fig 6 part of the midstream and downstream river samples was related to livestock waste and effluent detritus and only one reservoir site was influenced by organic matter from terrestrial soil microorganisms such as nitrifying bacteria could preferentially absorb the 14n generated by degradation reducing δ15n pon lehmann et al 2002 nitrogen isotope fractionation is also dependent on the growth rate of phytoplankton and the size of the din pool needoba and harrison 2004 wissel et al 2005 under the condition of n limitation the change of microbial gene would result in a shift in the community which leads to the increase in c n behrenfeld et al 2021 consistent with the present c n results average value was 4 8 1 2 furthermore the weak hydrodynamic condition of surface water in the study area prolonged the residence time of terrestrial pollutants it facilitated n consumption through biological assimilation liu et al 2020 which resulted in the low din content the δ15n pon displayed the endogenous characteristics of the river itself fig 6 in other words the self purification of the aquatic system decreased the concentration of din the isotopic fractionation of nitrate was obtained using the difference between δ15n no3 and δ15n pon assuming the rayleigh fractionation process van hale and frew 2010 in the one way reaction substrate s to product p process s and p represent no3 and pon respectively 4 ε 1000 α 1 1000 δ 15 n p δ 15 n s 1 δ 15 n p 1000 δ 15 n pon δ 15 n no 3 where ε is the isotope enrichment factor kendall et al 2008 thomas and rose 2003 the average ε value calculated in the present study was 1 5 4 5 ranging from 11 2 to 6 0 most of the ε values were negative suggesting that the lighter n was used preferentially during assimilation however it should note that phytoplankton assimilation utilized both ammonium and nitrate e g the present water samples with nh4 n for phytoplankton assimilation thus this calculation may overestimate the isotopic fractionation of nitrate during the assimilation as more obvious isotopic fractionation was observed in the assimilation of ammonium than nitrate waser et al 1998 4 3 nitrate sources qualitative and quantitative evidence potential nitrate sources include precipitation fertilizer soil reduced n fertilizer industrial sewage and animal manure sw m peters et al 2020 normally the source of n in precipitation has a high δ18o value 60 and δ15n of about 15 to 15 kendall et al 2007 in contrast the δ18o of nitrate fertilizer was lower than precipitation and predominately about 0 per mil but the range of δ15n is similar for both sources elliott et al 2007 kendall et al 2007 xue et al 2009 only three samples in the study area had a low δ15n value and a high δ18o value fig 5 implying a mixture of precipitation and fertilizer sources other samples 80 were fell in the typical range of sw m sources with δ15n no3 of 8 to 25 and δ18o no3 of 5 to 15 fig 5 el gaouzi et al 2013 wassenaar 1995 xing and liu 2016 xue et al 2009 in addition to the sources mentioned above soil organic nitrogen son was one of the essential sources and its no3 composition was generally considered to contribute between 2 and 8 xue et al 2009 a small number of samples in the study include a contribution from son consistent with the results obtained from pon a clear relationship between salinity and nitrate isotopes has not been received fig s9 so simple mixtures of seawater and freshwater cannot be responsible for nitrate isotopic variations which also observed in other studies archana et al 2018 ye et al 2015 wankel et al 2006 as well as the sources recognized above biologically mediated processes e g nitrification denitrification nitrogen fixation diffusion and volatilization are set to change significantly δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values as the low average concentration of nh4 n 0 12 mg l in the study area the effect of volatilization can be ignored sebilo et al 2006 yin et al 2020 biological participation in the n process can be identified which may modify the isotopic signature of n sources during the nitrification process nh4 might conceivably be turned into no3 by microorganisms theoretically the three oxygen atoms in nitrate no3 originate as one third air reported in the literature as δ18o o2 23 5 and two thirds dissolved o2 in water water sample δ18o measured in this study δ18o h2o ranges from 9 5 to 1 6 lin et al 2019 kendall et al 2007 5 δ 18 o no 3 1 3 δ 18 o o 2 2 3 δ 18 o h 2 o according to equation 5 it is calculated that the nitrate δ18o no3 produced by nitrification in the study area should be between 1 5 8 9 the light gray interval in fig 5 the measured results of the samples are in good agreement with the calculated predictions suggesting that most of the water in the study area was affected by nitrification there were eight water samples with relatively high δ18o no3 which might be influenced by the involvement of 18o enriched h2o during nitrification due to strong water evaporation li et al 2010 another six samples have relatively low δ18o no3 this might be linked to the oxygen atom exchange between nitrite and water during nitrification kool et al 2011 liu et al 2021 nitrate is converted to n2o or n2 due to denitrification and the content of no3 in water is reduced with enrichment of residual δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in a 2 1 ratio chen et al 2009 fenech et al 2012 zhang et al 2019b few samples with high δ15n no3 and low no3 might be affected by denitrification such as r7 r8 and re6 samples in the midstream fig 5 but the high dissolved oxygen concentration average 11 1 2 8 mg l n 101 in the study area supported the absence of denitrification based on the four nitrate sources presented in table s1 the contribution of different nitrate sources to nitrate in water expressed as mean s d with 25th and 75th confidence intervals can be quantitatively estimated mixsiar model table s4 and table s5 previous studies reported that sw and m have similar δ15n no3 values xue et al 2009 but a little different δ18o no3 values yin et al 2020 these two sources were combined as one end member from anthropological contribution sw m δ15n no3 14 4 3 2 δ18o no3 6 7 3 1 peters et al 2020 xian et al 2016 the mixsiar results showed that sw m contributed 52 23 of nitrates in contrast ap sn and cf contributed the remaining which indicated that the main contribution of nitrate derives from sw and m therefore the results of the quantitative estimation of no3 sources using the mixsiar model are consistent with the qualitative analysis results obtained by the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 isotopic signatures fig 5 table s4 detailed end member contribution information of different river segments and their uncertainties are shown in fig s10 furthermore the results also showed differences among river streams fig 8 fig 8a showed that sw m accounted for the vast majority of the contribution sources 60 of both river streams and reservoirs indeed in the posterior density distribution the peaks of the other four endmembers were all clustered together with sw m alone occupying the other side fig s2 c e were observed which may result in the overestimation of sw it should note that isotopic fractionation may influence the isotopic composition of end members and influence the source s proportion wild et al 2020 yue et al 2020 in the present study the major transformation of nitrogen is nitrification which may induce isotopic fractionation when the nh4 in the substrate has not been completely transformed this isotopic fractionation of nitrification depended on the degree of nitrification average δ15n no3 3 0 1 0 and average δ18o no3 4 1 1 3 buchwald and casciotti 2010 santoro and casciotti 2011 considering this isotopic fractionation effect the posterior density distribution seems more reliable fig s2 d f and the mixsiar results indicate that the contribution of sw m accounts for 39 12 61 13 and 57 15 from upstream midstream to downstream table s5 which also indicate the main contribution of sw m fig 8 b among them the upstream and reservoir sn contribution is more significant reaching 48 17 and 47 22 respectively consistent with farmlands distribution in the upstream and reservoir surrounding fig 1 4 4 implication for environmental management in cz the seasonal variation of water quality in the tianjin cz is mainly attributed to the operation of sluices which limited the amount of seawater intrusion during the dry season therefore artificial control of dams should be a key factor when considering the change in chemical components and water quality chen et al 2021 in addition to connecting river water and seawater some of these dams connect river and reservoir which could directly result in significant changes in the water quality of reservoir water e g ec fig s5 therefore when a large amount of reservoir water is used for drinking or irrigation it is necessary to consider closing dams to ensure water quality furthermore the water quality of the present cz rivers water changes in different seasons liu et al 2020 as for spatial variation combined with an exploration of the n geochemical process a box conceptual model for a cz of flat terrain and weak hydrodynamic conditions is proposed which shows the different extent of seawater intrusion evaporation and precipitation processes and the conversion and fractionation of n by comparing the nitrate isotopic composition δ15n no3 versus δ18o no3 of the present study area and other coastal areas fig 9 including the pearl river delta and the yellow river in china xuan et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 mun river in thailand liu et al 2021 bou areg in north morocco re and sacchi 2017 and eurasian coastal arctic thibodeau et al 2017 which indicated higher δ15n no3 in the present study area might attribute to sewage and manure sw m contribution policies for nitrate management in the tianjin cz should focus on the impact of sw m which exerts a significant control on the local nitrate pollution therefore controlling public and private sw m disposal seems necessary in the study area according to model calculations the downstream and midstream areas are likely to be more significantly influenced by sw m 60 the significant spatial heterogeneity presented unique challenges for the development of sustainable use in the tianjin cz and consideration of precisely delineated nitrate management models is an essential aspect of future water quality management policy in addition cognizance of temporal and spatial variation is critical to successful water management policy in the present cz there are numerous low flow czs worldwide whose water properties are also controlled by dams and are threatened by pollutant discharging liu et al 2021 xuan et al 2020 therefore potential similarities with the present cz may offer relevant insights and promote the development of management strategies based on the present study therefore the dlj and bdg are responsible for the migration and transformation of water and consequently can be regarded as the hot spot area of the cz for the land sea water and n interactions fig 10 additionally the present cz has the characteristics of a typical cz environment in northern china whose hydrodynamic conditions are monitored by dams emerging industries and well developed intensive agriculture ma et al 2012a therefore the present results offer a wider analog for czs in silty coastal zones like many coastal wetlands around the world brinson and malvárez 2002 they are particularly threatened by both anthropogenic e g reclamation water diversion damming pollution resource overuse and natural desertification and climate change factors an et al 2007 zhang et al 2021 5 conclusions based on hydrochemistry and various isotope methods this study carried out sampling and analysis of natural water in the area surrounding the beidagang reservoir and the duliujian river in a typical northern china coastal zone regional hydrochemical properties showed significant differences under seawater intrusion and weathering and the varying degrees of evaporation and precipitation processes the n content was depleted due to biological consumption and n stable isotope results show that bacterioplankton and phytoplankton contribute to nitrogen fractionation in pon during the n cycle nitrification was the cause of nitrate production and animal sewage and manure were the main source contributors to no3 while denitrification occurs rarely this work emphasized that cz management should consider the complexity of the water environment and the coupling of natural effects and human activities the results can guide cz intervention

3164,coastal zones cz are ecologically and environmentally significant and it is thus critical to study the interactions among different types of natural cz waters for better understanding biogeochemical processes water samples n 101 were analyzed for multiple stable isotopes δ18o h2o δd h2o δ15n pon δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in seawater river water reservoir water and groundwater at tianjin cz to demonstrate the spatial variations in the cz aqueous environment and to identify key influencing processes factors of the n geochemical cycle this study confirmed that weathering dominated upstream water properties whereas seawater intrusion determined the downstream and midstream water chemical components where the seawater fraction was 44 and 11 respectively evaporation and precipitation processes were active across the whole cz area but their impacts on water chemical components were less significant than seawater intrusion and weathering dam regulation in cz rivers has significantly affected water chemical components and the nitrogen cycle the isotopic evidence indicated that bacterioplankton and phytoplankton were the primary forms of pon the dual nitrate isotopes revealed that animal manure and industrial sewage contributed the leading nitrate to river water the spatial variation of their contribution was quantitated from upstream to midstream and downstream

environmental effects and providing policy support for regional management of the cz previous studies indicated that principal component analysis pca based on spatial and temporal distribution of

in the cz huang et al 2013 shrestha and kazama 2007 singh et al 2004 in addition isotope techniques can be used as natural intrinsic tracers to tackle environmental questions for example the variation of water isotope compositions δ18o h2o and δd h2o provide information for water evaporation migration transformation and hydraulic connection gibson et al 1996 helena et al 2000 the stable isotope

intervention river duliujian river northern china in cz was chosen to understand the potential factors influencing water quality the principal factors were comprehensively evaluated using pca water isotopes pon stable isotope and nitrate dual stable isotopes the objectives of the present study were to 1 explore the effects of land and sea interactions and monsoonal climate on the water properties of cz 2 reveal the temporal and spatial characteristics of n in pon and nitrate and 3 quantitatively determine the effects of various hydrochemical conditions and nitrate sources on different river reaches a conceptual framework for tianjin cz was developed which can aid the understanding of other czs with similar natural conditions and support environmental management 2

n sources the duliujian river has 27 factory sewage outfalls throughout the river channel mainly distributed in the midstream of the dlj river liu et al 2020 while there are more villages upstream the terrain is low and flat and the drainage is relatively restricted the sediments are mainly composed of fine silts and sands and are characterized by moderate permeability slow runoff and little recharge resulting in a weak hydrodynamic force hu et al 2009 according to china s national surface water environmental quality standard gb 3838 2002 96 of the water around the bdg was worse than the category v water standard from 2015 to 2017 he et al 2020 the sluices mainly control the flow fluctuation in the reservoir and rivers the river water can enter the reservoir from the inlet sluice while the reservoir water can flow into dlj from the outlet sluice from 2007 to 2015 the discharge data of the dlj at the outlet between r1 and s1 fig 1 show that the average monthly flow of the dlj is close to 0 from january to june flow periods were from july to december with discharge below 10 m3 s fig s1 in such cases of low surface runoff the closure of the sluices can raise the surface water level the bdg and dlj re1 re3 connected through the sluice therefore the characteristics of flow conditions in the study area are weak hydrodynamic 2 2 water sampling and analytical methods

processes to determine the water chemical components in the study area güler et al 2002 thyne et al 2004 thirteen physical and chemical variables from the data set consisting of all water samples n

components pcs for 90 95 of the variation güler et al 2012 2 4 nitrate sources apportionment the bayesian source distribution mixing model mixsiar stable isotope analysis in r ver 1 3 1093 was used to estimate the contribution of different sources when quantifying the source apportionment of nitrate stock et al 2018 the mixsiar can estimate source contribution while accounting for variability in the source and mixture tracer data moore and semmens 2008 and include fixed and random effects as covariates explaining variability in mixture proportions the model can be expressed as follows 3 x i j 1 j p j s j s j n μ j δ j 2 where x1 was the ith mixture of fitted data where i 1 2 3 n pj was the proportional contributions or mixing fractions of j source j 1 n sj was the isotope value of the j source obtained from a normal distribution with mean μ j and standard deviation δj 2 this study used mixsiar analysis the non informative prior distribution of mixing contributions of avoiding uncertainty the pairs plot showed that the correlations between five sources and posterior probability distributions of possible source contributions to the mixture were determined by explicitly considering source uncertainty fig s2 generally the gelman diagnostic should be 1 05 for better convergence of the model when running the model mcmc parameters were set to long chain length 300 000

sedimentation seawater intrusion and multiple transgression events meng et al 2009 supported by the hydrochemistry of samples the seasonal variation in water chemistry parameters is shown in fig s 3c

the do in the summer july and august were lower than that in spring and winter april and november han et al 2021 the ph variation of all samples ranged from 7 5 to 9 3 with an average value of 8 5 0 3 fig s3 in terms of spatial variation the ec showed a significant salinity gradient ranging from 0 5 to 50 1 ms cm fig s3 a of which the upstream and midstream had a mean value of 1 8 0 9 ms cm and 7 5

factors e g dam building was evaluated using the δr re ec value i e river s ec value minus reservoir s ec value during the sampling period four sample sets r2 re1 r3 re2 r4 re3 r7 re6 were chosen to assess the impact effect of artificial dams for example the average value of δr re ec was 0 1 1 4 ms cm during the dam opening period and was 30 7 4 8 ms cm during the dams closing period fig s5 indicating that artificial sluices could effectively prevent the intrusion of seawater into the reservoir water in the study area this result demonstrated that the management of dams could influence the water chemical components in present weak hydrological cz rivers the seawater fraction f provided information on the spatially affected vary by seawater abou zakhem and hafez 2007 based on equation 2 the average f value was 44 1 32 3 downstream which was higher than the downstream of yellow river 7 7 8 8 fan et al 2014 the f value decreased to 11 0 22 3 in midstream and changed little upstream 0 1 1 8 indicating that this cz is severely affected by seawater intrusion moreover the reservoir water was less affected than the midstream at 5 2 4 1 owing to artificial dams fig 3 3 2 isotopic compositions δ18o δd of water the water stable isotope values in the study area ranged from 72 3 to 6 0 for δd mean 30 3 16 2 n 101 and from 9 5 to 1 6 for δ18o h2o mean 2 7 2 8 n 101 fig 3 seasonal changes are shown in fig s6 water isotope data showed similar trends with the local meteoric water line lmwl zhang et al 2017 in contrast all surface water isotope compositions approached the lmwl and were situated in the lower right fig 3 with linear fitting performance on the test results the correlation is significant δd 5 6 δ18o 15 2 n 101 r2 0 94 p 0 01 in terms of spatial distribution salinity concentration gradually increases to the coastline fig 4 a the water isotope values appeared in a similar trend fig 4 b c consistent with the basis for the subdivision of the river between upstream and downstream the d excess is an important indicator of the relationship between hydrogen and oxygen isotopes indicating the atmospheric humidity of the water vapor source and the hydrological environment such as the process of regional evaporation and fractionation araguás araguás et al 1998 cui and li 2015 tian et al 2007 the d excess calculated by d excess δd 8 δ18o varied from 25 1 to 6 9 with a mean value of 8 5 7 9 fig 4 d july had the lowest d excess value average july br 14 9 5 7 and average july ar 14 9 5 0 april had the highest d excess average value of 2 9 6 0 3 3 n concentration and isotopic composition no3 n was the main component in the study area with an average value of 0 4 0 6 mg l and a maximum value of 2 9 mg l fig s7 the average no2 n was 0 05 0 2 mg l the maximum value 1 36 mg l fig s7 and 32 samples were below the detection limit 0 005 mg l the average value of nh4 n was 0 1 0 3 mg l and the maximum value was 1 43 mg l fig s7 the average value of δ15n no3 was 11 8 4 5 with a range of 4 7 20 7 the average value of δ18o no3 was 7 3 6 6 ranging from 2 3 to 25 3 fig 5 however the distribution of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 isotopes in the study area was more heterogeneous the samples in april had the lowest value of δ15n no3 average δ15n no3 7 7 3 1 and average δ18o no3 10 1 8 5 δ15n no3 in july and august average δ15n no3 11 4 4 0 was higher than in april november had the highest δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 with an average of 14 0 4 3 and 7 2 5 0 respectively c n ranged from 3 4 to 8 9 mean 4 8 1 2 n 40 which overlaps with the c n ratio of both phytoplankton 4 8 wissel et al 2005 and bacterioplankton 3 5 lehmann et al 2002 fig 6 the spatial variation of c n was small and the average c n of different water streams showed a slight decrease from 5 0 in upstream 4 5 in midstream to 4 2 in downstream the δ15n value of pon ranged from 0 1 to 18 0 mean 9 3 5 0 n 40 the mean of δ15n pon decreased from upstream 13 1 to downstream 10 8 however δ15n pon in waters showed a lower mean value in the reservoir samples 3 7 than in river water particularly in july br ranging from 2 4 to18 0 with an average of 11 7 it can be concluded that seasonal change had no noticeable effect on the distribution of δ15n pon 4 discussion 4 1 seawater intrusion and weathering determining water chemical components in cz the decreased mixing ratio of the seawater f obtained from equation 2 from downstream 44 32 through midstream 11 22 to upstream 0 1 2 further supports the influence of seawater intrusion on the properties of natural water in the study area fig 3 especially as an explanation of spatial variation due to the fragility of coastal ecosystems rising sea levels and changing climate seawater intrusion occurs in most coastal areas worldwide werner et al 2013 but the vast regional differences lead to uncertainty in the assessment of seawater intrusion compared with similar cz studies for example the highest f fraction in the essaouira basin was 16 ouhamdouch et al 2021 while the mean f value on the syrian coast north of latakia was 4 3 abou zakhem and hafez 2007 which were both of them below the present study average 16 30 hydrochemical studies of seawater intrusion can represent one extreme of the freshwater saltwater mixture but this mixing is superimposed with other processes pulido leboeuf 2004 the gibbs figure fig 2 b and c allows the contribution of two end members seawater and weathering to be explored li et al 2020 marandi and shand 2018 recognizing that most of the remaining water chemical components lie between these two end members also affected by the evaporation and precipitation process compared to other coastal rivers e g pearl river delta yangtze river estuary and the lower reaches of the yellow river the water composition of the study area was quite different fig s8 a and b for example the water chemistry of the pearl river delta li et al 2020 and the yangtze river estuary ding et al 2014 are substantially different from the seawater end member and the hydrochemical facies were mainly of the hco3 and so4 2 type which is primarily attributable to weathering however the water in the lower reaches of the yellow river fan et al 2014 and the tianjin cz area showed a certain degree of similarity it may be linked to the flat terrain and weak hydrodynamic conditions of the cz region in northern china represented by the yellow river delta and the present study area the apparent gradient of water isotopes from upstream to downstream demonstrated that varied water sources contributed from seawater and freshwater which also agreed with those obtained by the results of seawater fraction fig 3 in addition the relationship between the water isotope data and the lmwl further indicated the influence of the evaporation and precipitation process in the study area fig 3 the negative d excess value especially in the summer might further indicate that high altitude unbalanced vapor in the study area was mixed with saturated vapor near the seawater controlled by the summer monsoon shi et al 2021 however unlike the single variation of water isotopes with the distance from the coastal area the d excess variation was more irregular fig 4 d related to an unbalanced evaporation effect in the study area roy et al 2022 wu et al 2019 the linear mixing models show that many factors do ec t water isotopes and chemical components influenced the monthly samples and streams table s2 quantified using pca four principal components pcs were extracted via the pca method and explained 92 8 of the variance table s3 pc 1 and pc 2 explained 72 8 of the total variance fig 7 a among them pc 1 was 58 5 of the variance contribution rate of seven ion compositions and ec in the water body changing significantly under the influence of seawater intrusion downstream and weathering upstream fig 2 b and c huang et al 2013 jia et al 2012 so pc 1 was defined as the seawater intrusion and weathering factor siwf pc 2 was dominated by t ph and do with a variance contribution of 14 3 mainly determined by changes in the seasonal hydrochemical characteristics zhang et al 2012 it can be defined as the water quality seasonal factor wqsf pc 3 was correlated with water isotopes and had a variance contribution of 11 7 pc 4 was associated with total alkalinity and had a variance contribution of 8 3 table s2 pc 3 and pc 4 might be influenced by the evaporation and precipitation process probably due to the warm and semi humid continental monsoon climate the difference in water chemistry characteristics between april july and august was insignificant however there were apparent differences between these three months and november the former three months were affected to a similar extent by siwf and wqsf while the latter was influenced mainly by wqsf fig 7 b the spatial effects of siwf and wqsf on water quality parameters were more spatially significant siwf can determine the classification of different river streams upstream downstream with the eigenvalue of 7 6 and showed apparent changes in the horizontal axis fig 7 c this suggested that the siwf was the major factor influencing water quality parameters its influence was far more than wqsf the eigenvalue is 1 9 similar to other studies güler et al 2012 jia et al 2012 pc 3 and pc 4 with a combined contribution of 20 0 indicated that the influence of the evaporation and precipitation process should also be considered thus the results of pca showed four major factors that can be used as a quantitative reference frame for the cz water chemical properties 4 2 nitrogen processes seasonal changes in pon isotope values were not noticeable here fig 6 a but the δ15n pon of the river mean 11 7 was significantly higher than the δ15n pon of the reservoir mean 3 7 fig 6 b conceivably the higher value of δ15n pon might be due to industrial and domestic sewage contribution to the river while the reservoir had lower δ15n pon values under the influence of aquatic plants aravena et al 1993 compared with the n biogeochemical cycle organic matter degradation assimilation and absorption of the river the internal environment of the reservoir is more stable and the low c n and δ15n pon depleted organic matter is gradually released from the dominant position the contribution of 15n depleted bacterial biomass gradually increased lehmann et al 2002 the relationship between δ15n pon and c n shows that the pon in the reservoir mainly originated from bacterioplankton and phytoplankton fig 6 part of the midstream and downstream river samples was related to livestock waste and effluent detritus and only one reservoir site was influenced by organic matter from terrestrial soil microorganisms such as nitrifying bacteria could preferentially absorb the 14n generated by degradation reducing δ15n pon lehmann et al 2002 nitrogen isotope fractionation is also dependent on the growth rate of phytoplankton and the size of the din pool needoba and harrison 2004 wissel et al 2005 under the condition of n limitation the change of microbial gene would result in a shift in the community which leads to the increase in c n behrenfeld et al 2021 consistent with the present c n results average value was 4 8 1 2 furthermore the weak hydrodynamic condition of surface water in the study area prolonged the residence time of terrestrial pollutants it facilitated n consumption through biological assimilation liu et al 2020 which resulted in the low din content the δ15n pon displayed the endogenous characteristics of the river itself fig 6 in other words the self purification of the aquatic system decreased the concentration of din the isotopic fractionation of nitrate was obtained using the difference between δ15n no3 and δ15n pon assuming the rayleigh fractionation process van hale and frew 2010 in the one way reaction substrate s to product p process s and p represent no3 and pon respectively 4 ε 1000 α 1 1000 δ 15 n p δ 15 n s 1 δ 15 n p 1000 δ 15 n pon δ 15 n no 3 where ε is the isotope enrichment factor kendall et al 2008 thomas and rose 2003 the average ε value calculated in the present study was 1 5 4 5 ranging from 11 2 to 6 0 most of the ε values were negative suggesting that the lighter n was used preferentially during assimilation however it should note that phytoplankton assimilation utilized both ammonium and nitrate e g the present water samples with nh4 n for phytoplankton assimilation thus this calculation may overestimate the isotopic fractionation of nitrate during the assimilation as more obvious isotopic fractionation was observed in the assimilation of ammonium than nitrate waser et al 1998 4 3 nitrate sources qualitative and quantitative evidence potential nitrate sources include precipitation fertilizer soil reduced n fertilizer industrial sewage and animal manure sw m peters et al 2020 normally the source of n in precipitation has a high δ18o value 60 and δ15n of about 15 to 15 kendall et al 2007 in contrast the δ18o of nitrate fertilizer was lower than precipitation and predominately about 0 per mil but the range of δ15n is similar for both sources elliott et al 2007 kendall et al 2007 xue et al 2009 only three samples in the study area had a low δ15n value and a high δ18o value fig 5 implying a mixture of precipitation and fertilizer sources other samples 80 were fell in the typical range of sw m sources with δ15n no3 of 8 to 25 and δ18o no3 of 5 to 15 fig 5 el gaouzi et al 2013 wassenaar 1995 xing and liu 2016 xue et al 2009 in addition to the sources mentioned above soil organic nitrogen son was one of the essential sources and its no3 composition was generally considered to contribute between 2 and 8 xue et al 2009 a small number of samples in the study include a contribution from son consistent with the results obtained from pon a clear relationship between salinity and nitrate isotopes has not been received fig s9 so simple mixtures of seawater and freshwater cannot be responsible for nitrate isotopic variations which also observed in other studies archana et al 2018 ye et al 2015 wankel et al 2006 as well as the sources recognized above biologically mediated processes e g nitrification denitrification nitrogen fixation diffusion and volatilization are set to change significantly δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values as the low average concentration of nh4 n 0 12 mg l in the study area the effect of volatilization can be ignored sebilo et al 2006 yin et al 2020 biological participation in the n process can be identified which may modify the isotopic signature of n sources during the nitrification process nh4 might conceivably be turned into no3 by microorganisms theoretically the three oxygen atoms in nitrate no3 originate as one third air reported in the literature as δ18o o2 23 5 and two thirds dissolved o2 in water water sample δ18o measured in this study δ18o h2o ranges from 9 5 to 1 6 lin et al 2019 kendall et al 2007 5 δ 18 o no 3 1 3 δ 18 o o 2 2 3 δ 18 o h 2 o according to equation 5 it is calculated that the nitrate δ18o no3 produced by nitrification in the study area should be between 1 5 8 9 the light gray interval in fig 5 the measured results of the samples are in good agreement with the calculated predictions suggesting that most of the water in the study area was affected by nitrification there were eight water samples with relatively high δ18o no3 which might be influenced by the involvement of 18o enriched h2o during nitrification due to strong water evaporation li et al 2010 another six samples have relatively low δ18o no3 this might be linked to the oxygen atom exchange between nitrite and water during nitrification kool et al 2011 liu et al 2021 nitrate is converted to n2o or n2 due to denitrification and the content of no3 in water is reduced with enrichment of residual δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in a 2 1 ratio chen et al 2009 fenech et al 2012 zhang et al 2019b few samples with high δ15n no3 and low no3 might be affected by denitrification such as r7 r8 and re6 samples in the midstream fig 5 but the high dissolved oxygen concentration average 11 1 2 8 mg l n 101 in the study area supported the absence of denitrification based on the four nitrate sources presented in table s1 the contribution of different nitrate sources to nitrate in water expressed as mean s d with 25th and 75th confidence intervals can be quantitatively estimated mixsiar model table s4 and table s5 previous studies reported that sw and m have similar δ15n no3 values xue et al 2009 but a little different δ18o no3 values yin et al 2020 these two sources were combined as one end member from anthropological contribution sw m δ15n no3 14 4 3 2 δ18o no3 6 7 3 1 peters et al 2020 xian et al 2016 the mixsiar results showed that sw m contributed 52 23 of nitrates in contrast ap sn and cf contributed the remaining which indicated that the main contribution of nitrate derives from sw and m therefore the results of the quantitative estimation of no3 sources using the mixsiar model are consistent with the qualitative analysis results obtained by the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 isotopic signatures fig 5 table s4 detailed end member contribution information of different river segments and their uncertainties are shown in fig s10 furthermore the results also showed differences among river streams fig 8 fig 8a showed that sw m accounted for the vast majority of the contribution sources 60 of both river streams and reservoirs indeed in the posterior density distribution the peaks of the other four endmembers were all clustered together with sw m alone occupying the other side fig s2 c e were observed which may result in the overestimation of sw it should note that isotopic fractionation may influence the isotopic composition of end members and influence the source s proportion wild et al 2020 yue et al 2020 in the present study the major transformation of nitrogen is nitrification which may induce isotopic fractionation when the nh4 in the substrate has not been completely transformed this isotopic fractionation of nitrification depended on the degree of nitrification average δ15n no3 3 0 1 0 and average δ18o no3 4 1 1 3 buchwald and casciotti 2010 santoro and casciotti 2011 considering this isotopic fractionation effect the posterior density distribution seems more reliable fig s2 d f and the mixsiar results indicate that the contribution of sw m accounts for 39 12 61 13 and 57 15 from upstream midstream to downstream table s5 which also indicate the main contribution of sw m fig 8 b among them the upstream and reservoir sn contribution is more significant reaching 48 17 and 47 22 respectively consistent with farmlands distribution in the upstream and reservoir surrounding fig 1 4 4 implication for environmental management in cz the seasonal variation of water quality in the tianjin cz is mainly attributed to the operation of sluices which limited the amount of seawater intrusion during the dry season therefore artificial control of dams should be a key factor when considering the change in chemical components and water quality chen et al 2021 in addition to connecting river water and seawater some of these dams connect river and reservoir which could directly result in significant changes in the water quality of reservoir water e g ec fig s5 therefore when a large amount of reservoir water is used for drinking or irrigation it is necessary to consider closing dams to ensure water quality furthermore the water quality of the present cz rivers water changes in different seasons liu et al 2020 as for spatial variation combined with an exploration of the n geochemical process a box conceptual model for a cz of flat terrain and weak hydrodynamic conditions is proposed which shows the different extent of seawater intrusion evaporation and precipitation processes and the conversion and fractionation of n by comparing the nitrate isotopic composition δ15n no3 versus δ18o no3 of the present study area and other coastal areas fig 9 including the pearl river delta and the yellow river in china xuan et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 mun river in thailand liu et al 2021 bou areg in north morocco re and sacchi 2017 and eurasian coastal arctic thibodeau et al 2017 which indicated higher δ15n no3 in the present study area might attribute to sewage and manure sw m contribution policies for nitrate management in the tianjin cz should focus on the impact of sw m which exerts a significant control on the local nitrate pollution therefore controlling public and private sw m disposal seems necessary in the study area according to model calculations the downstream and midstream areas are likely to be more significantly influenced by sw m 60 the significant spatial heterogeneity presented unique challenges for the development of sustainable use in the tianjin cz and consideration of precisely delineated nitrate management models is an essential aspect of future water quality management policy in addition cognizance of temporal and spatial variation is critical to successful water management policy in the present cz there are numerous low flow czs worldwide whose water properties are also controlled by dams and are threatened by pollutant discharging liu et al 2021 xuan et al 2020 therefore potential similarities with the present cz may offer relevant insights and promote the development of management strategies based on the present study therefore the dlj and bdg are responsible for the migration and transformation of water and consequently can be regarded as the hot spot area of the cz for the land sea water and n interactions fig 10 additionally the present cz has the characteristics of a typical cz environment in northern china whose hydrodynamic conditions are monitored by dams emerging industries and well developed intensive agriculture ma et al 2012a therefore the present results offer a wider analog for czs in silty coastal zones like many coastal wetlands around the world brinson and malvárez 2002 they are particularly threatened by both anthropogenic e g reclamation water diversion damming pollution resource overuse and natural desertification and climate change factors an et al 2007 zhang et al 2021 5 conclusions based on hydrochemistry and various isotope methods this study carried out sampling and analysis of natural water in the area surrounding the beidagang reservoir and the duliujian river in a typical northern china coastal zone regional hydrochemical properties showed significant differences under seawater intrusion and weathering and the varying degrees of evaporation and precipitation processes the n content was depleted due to biological consumption and n stable isotope results show that bacterioplankton and phytoplankton contribute to nitrogen fractionation in pon during the n cycle nitrification was the cause of nitrate production and animal sewage and manure were the main source contributors to no3 while denitrification occurs rarely this work emphasized that cz management should consider the complexity of the water environment and the coupling of natural effects and human activities the results can guide cz intervention and the deployment of ecological management of pollutants credit authorship contribution statement xin chu wang investigation data curation formal analysis writing original draft fu jun yue
