5125,forest canopies create a high spatial variability of both canopy interception ei and acid deposition however spatial characteristics of these hydrochemical fluxes along a slope gradient in forest watersheds remain unclear here we monitored bulk precipitation bp throughfall tf stemflow sf and associated nitrate no3 and sulfate so4 2 in an upper slope plot up and a lower slope plot lp in a subtropical broadleaved forest southeast china results showed that annual rates of tf sf and ei to bp in up were 85 2 2 6 and 12 2 respectively corresponding values in lp were 88 6 2 2 and 9 2 there were no significant differences among these rainfall partitioning components between up and lp additionally annual volume weighted mean concentrations of no3 n in tf and sf were significantly lower than in bp whereas no significant differences were found for so4 2 s among bp tf and sf unlike annual tf no3 n fluxes were similar in up and lp annual tf so4 2 s fluxes significantly increased along the up to lp net tf sf ntf fluxes were negative for no3 n and so4 2 s at the two slope plots illustrating retained uptake in the canopy dormant season ntf s fluxes were close to zero indicating that dry deposition does not appear to play a major role whereas exchange with foliage surfaces should be the dominant factor controlling the spatial patterns of tf n and s fluxes in the watershed this study can contribute to the evaluation of watershed scale water and acidifying input into the soil during canopy passage and further consequent effects on forest ecosystems keywords acidic deposition

assess the spatial distribution of water and acidifying input into the soil and further the consequent effects on hydrological biogeochemical and ecological cycling in forest ecosystems there is a large body of scientific work examining the hydrochemical characteristics and spatial variability of tf and sf at tree levels beier et al 1993 zhang et al 2019 fathizadeh et al 2020 in pure and or mixed stands berger et al 2008 zimmermann et al 2008 legout et al 2016 salehi et al 2016 along an urbanization gradient fang et al 2011 rao et al 2013 ponette gonz√°lez et al 2017 and in different land use types dezzeo and chacon 2006 macinnis ng et al 2012 for different tree species around the world for example an urban suburban rural gradient study found that tf no3 n fluxes increased along a suburban to urban to rural gradient in tropical and subtropical forests fang et al 2011 salehi et al 2016 reported that tf no3 n fluxes were higher in the mixed stand fagus orientalis lipsky carpinus betulus l and acer velutinum boiss than in the pure stand of oriental beech f orientalis zhang et al 2019 found tf so4 2 fluxes were higher at the gap edge than in the closed canopy especially near the trunk in a subalpine spruce picea asperata mast plantation additionally tf and sf chemistry esp no3 and so4 2 are strongly influenced by tree species through different scavenging of atmospheric dry deposition and canopy exchanges de schrijver et al 2007 legout et al 2016 compared to deciduous forests coniferous canopies tend to enhance acid deposition through more efficiently scavenge dry deposition of no3 and so4 2 de schrijver et al 2007 despite these important findings in previous studies there is a paucity of data depicting how these hydrochemical fluxes via tf and sf vary along slope gradients within forest watershed although it may have important implications for sampling strategy and interpretation of average deposition fluxes to forest floor in forest watershed the deliveries of tf and sf fluxes are affected by site characteristics e g elevation slope and aspect within the watershed which directly influence microclimate deposition velocity and soil fertility across topographic gradients rodrigo et al 2003 hofhansl et al 2011 2012 macinnis ng et al 2012 siegert et al 2016 site located at higher elevations may be capable of generating greater tf amount and enhanced dry deposition especially those above the average cloud base holder 2004 hofhansl et al 2011 found dry deposition was increased at the ridge forest compared to at the ravine site in a tropical lowland rainforest slope and aspect are main controls of species composition that led to differences in tf amount siegert et al 2016 found tf amount was significantly lower on the steepest plot than on the moderately sloping plots in a temperate deciduous forest if tf and sf fluxes vary along a slope the effect of site characteristics will likely make scaling in a forest watershed more complicated and increase the uncertainties in evaluating the internal processes and cycling in forest ecosystems nevertheless the hydrochemical characteristics and spatial patterns of rainfall partitioning and associated no3 and so4 2 fluxes at different slope positions within a watershed has not received much attention and remains unclear tropical and subtropical forests are more vulnerable to atmospheric deposition compared to temperate forests because they are strongly weathered with low base cations soils and poorly buffered against acid deposition bruijnzeel 1991 fang et al 2011 homeier et al 2012 until now comparable data are still needed for the effect of acid deposition on tropical and subtropical forests fang et al 2008 hofhansl et al 2011 lu et al 2014 yu et al 2018 additionally china is one of the three regions with the highest nitrogen deposition in the world particularly in southern china du et al 2014 yu et al 2019 acid deposition leads to significant acidification for tropical and subtropical forests lu et al 2014 therefore we conducted tf and sf measurements in upper and lower slope plots in a subtropical montane forest southeast china we hypothesized that the upper slope plot would exhibit increased fluxes of no3 and so4 2 in tf and sf as result of higher dry deposition therefore the aims of the present study were to 1 quantify and compare the differences in rainfall partitioning and associated no3 and so4 2 fluxes at the two slope positions and 2 examine the effects of site morphological characteristics and seasonality on these hydrochemical fluxes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site is located within a watershed 7 8 ha in national nature reserve wuyi mountains in the north part of fujian province southeast china 27 33 27 54 n 117 27 117 5 e 450 m a s l this reserve is about 50 km south of nanping city and about 260 km southeast of the capital city fuzhou the reserve has a humid warm subtropical monsoon climate featuring abundant precipitation and full sunshine the mean annual temperature between 1995 and 2014 at the nearest wuyishan national weather station was 14 2 c and the annual mean relative humidity was 83 5 the mean annual precipitation was 2583 mm with a distant seasonal pattern 60 falling from later april to august leaf emergence starts in may with the growing season lasting through october when senescence starts the dormant season is categorized as november through april the topography is highly heterogeneous with slopes ranging from 15 to 35 the soil is lateritic red earth formed from sandstone two study plots an upper slope plot up and a lower slope plot lp were randomly established in the watershed for study distance between up and lp was approximately 185 m apart the two plots were located on a south facing slope with a slope of approximate 30 plots were set up in triplicate as squares of 10 20 m separated by a distance of approximately 10 m the dominated evergreen and deciduous broadleaved tree species were castanopsis carlesii castanopsis faberi castanopsis eyrei castanopsis fordii symplocos congesta symplocos sumuntia and elaeocarpus japonicas inside these plots all trees were inventoried to determine the stand structure variables and species level between 2 0 and 10 cm diameter at breast height dbh and above 10 cm dbh table 1 stem density stems ha 1 and basal area m2 ha 1 were estimated by individual numbers and dbh in the plots plant area index was determined from the total vertical canopy projection area divided by the plot area fisher s alpha index was calculated as an indicator of species diversity by the number of species and the number of individuals in those species with an open javascript program http groundvegetationdb web com ground veg home diversity index 2 2 sample collection and analysis bp tf and sf were measured and sampled from november 2014 to november 2015 three collectors consisting of a 29 cm diameter funnel connected to a 20 l polyethylene bottle were used for sampling bp these collectors were placed at a clearing site with an area of 780 m2 located approximately 300 m away from the two slope plots the water volumes in the three collectors were measured manually using a graduated cylinder and then combined to provide a composited sample at rainfall event sampling the funnels and bottles were rinsed with deionized water after each collection tf and sf were sampled in the triplicate plots in up and lp three tf collectors consisting of a 26 cm diameter funnel connected to 15 l polyethylene bottle were randomly placed in each plot these collectors were fixed at 1 5 m height aboveground each bottle was covered by aluminium paper and each funnel had a ping pong ball as a plastic float to prevent contamination by coarse debris and water evaporation during and between sampling intervals during the study period approximately 10 samples were lost due to litterfall and funnel clogging the water volumes in the collectors were measured using a graduated cylinder on an event basis and pooled in the field to a single composited sample per plot after each sampling the funnels and bottles were thoroughly rinsed with distilled water in addition sf was sampled in three trees in each repetitive plot in up and lp the sampled trees consisted of the dominant tree species in the study site with a mean dbh of 21 6 cm 13 4 33 6 cm the sampled tree was equipped with a flexible tubing around the trunk at about 1 3 m height with a draining hole connected to a 80 l bucket the tubing was stapled to the tree trunk and silicone sealant was applied sealing the collar to the trunk to avoid sf losses the collectors were bulk in proportion to the collected volume into a single composited sample per plot and were cleaned with deionized water after each collection the water volume accumulated by each sampled tree was measured from each plot the sf water depth mm was computed using the following equation hanchi and rapp 1997 1 sf i 1 n v n m a 10 4 where vn is the average volume ml from sampled trees in a certain dbh class a is the plot area m2 n is the number of dbh classes and m is number of trees belonging to a certain dbh class in the plot fig 1 a 250 ml subsamples of bp tf and sf were taken to the laboratory and refrigerated at 4 c within 48 h of collection the samples were filtered through a 0 45 Œºm non phosphorus filter and then measured by ion chromatography to determine the concentrations mg l 1 of no3 and so4 2 volume weighted mean vwm was used to express mean concentrations of no3 and so4 2 in bp tf and sf of individual events zimmermann et al 2008 hofhansl et al 2012 2 v w m n 1 i c i v i n 1 i v i where ci and vi are the concentration and volume at collector i for a given event the event based fluxes of no3 and so4 2 were calculated by multiplying vwm ion concentrations with the corresponding water volumes of bp tf and sf yearly and seasonal deposition fluxes kg ha 1 were obtained as the product of these vwm concentrations and the corresponding annual seasonal water volume net tf sf flux ntf integrated dry deposition and canopy exchange processes and was also calculated by subtracting the fluxes of tf and sf from bp additionally a rainfall event was defined as a period 2 mm of gross rainfall two subsequent events were isolated by 24 h of dry period canopy interception ei during and after a rainfall event was then calculated using the water balance of rainfall partitioning crockford and richardson 2000 sun et al 2015 3 ei t f s f b p 2 3 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were conducted in r 3 6 3 r core team 2020 linear mixed models using the nlme package pinheiro et al 2020 were used to analyze the effect of slope i e up and lp season i e growing and dormant and slope by season interaction on the concentrations of no3 and so4 2 in tf and sf in addition to the fluxes of water no3 and so4 2 in tf sf and ntf slope and season were fixed factors while subplot location was a random factor post hoc comparisons were tested using tukey s hsd when significant differences between means were detected differences in stand structure variables concentration and fluxes between up and lp among seasons were tested by one way anova with tukey s hsd statistically significant differences were set at p values 0 05 unless otherwise stated 3 results 3 1 vegetation characteristics and canopy water balance in up and lp analysis of species compositions showed that forest types

are shown at annual and season growing and dormant scales in table 2 the annual amount of bp was 2623 7 mm obtained from a total of 21 rainfall events ranging from 10 6 mm to 287 7 mm event based tf and sf in up and lp increased linearly with bp with an r 2 values of 0 99 and 0 84 respectively by the least squares method fig 2 rainfall was highly seasonal with most of the rain falling during the growing season 1950 mm 74 3 of bp while dormant season rainfall was 673 7 mm accounting for 25 7 of bp table 2 the annual tf amount was 2235 7 58 0 mm 85 2 2 2 of bp and 2323 1 78 7 mm 88 6 3 0 of bp

growing season 0 59 mg l 1 table 4 slope position had a significant effect on tf no3 n concentration in the dormant season p 0 05 table 4 dormant season tf no3 n concentration was significantly lower

two fold higher in up and four fold higher in lp compared to the growing season table 4 in addition the sf no3 n concentrations differed significantly between seasons p 0 01 dormant season sf no3 n concentration was more than two fold higher compared to the growing season at the two slope plots while there was no slope effect or slope by season interaction table 4 unlike no3 n although annual vwm concentrations of so4 2 s in bp was slightly higher than in tf and sf in both up and lp there were no significant differences among them table 3 the so4 2 s concentrations in these hydrochemical fluxes also exhibited clear seasonal trends fig 3b the bp so4 2 s concentration was higher in the dormant season 1 42 mg l 1 than in the growing season 0 84 mg l 1 table 4 season p 0 01 had significant effects on tf and sf so4 2 s concentrations during the dormant season tf and sf so4 2 s concentrations were more than two fold higher except for sf in up 1 8 fold than during the growing season in up and lp however slope or slope by season had no significant effects table 4 3 3 fluxes of no3 and so4 2 in bp tf and sf the up and lp received similar fluxes of tf no3 n deposition with 6 31 0 63 and 7 90 0 91 kg ha 1 yr 1 respectively which were significantly lower than in bp 20 17 kg ha 1 yr 1 table 3 fig 4 a the tf no3 n fluxes did not differ significantly between slopes p 0 14 or between seasons p 0 06 but there was slope by season interaction p 0 01 table 4 fig 4a dormant season tf no3 n fluxes were significantly lower in up than in lp but growing season differences between the two slopes were not significant the annual sf no3 n fluxes were very small with 0 20 0 02 kg ha 1 yr 1 in up and 0 16 0 03 kg ha 1 yr 1 in lp table 3 and did not differ significantly p 0 05 between slopes or between seasons in addition to no slope by season interaction table 4 fig 4a furthermore the annual ntf no3 n fluxes were similar and negative in up 13 66 0 65 kg ha 1 yr 1 and lp 11 10 0 93 kg ha 1 yr 1 table 3 fig 5 a season p 0 001 and season by slope p 0 01 had significant effects on ntf no3 n fluxes growing season ntf no3 n fluxes was significantly lower than in the dormant season at the two slope plots particularly dormant season ntf fluxes was significantly lower in up than in lp table 4 fig 5a annual tf so4 2 s fluxes significantly p 0 001 increased along the up 17 18 0 47 kg ha 1 yr 1 to lp 22 51 1 16 kg ha 1 yr 1 which were significantly p 0 001 lower than in bp 26 50 kg ha 1 yr 1 table 3 fig 4b slope p 0 05 and season p 0 05 had significant effects on tf so4 2 s fluxes but there was no slope by season interaction table 4 fig 4b growing season tf so4 2 s fluxes were significantly lower in up than in lp the annual sf so4 2 s fluxes were also very small with 0 58 0 02 kg ha 1 yr 1 in up and 0 45 0 16 kg ha 1 yr 1 in lp table 3 and did not differ between slopes or between seasons in addition to no slope by season interaction table 4 fig 4b furthermore the annual ntf so4 2 s fluxes in up were 8 74 0 49 kg ha 1 yr 1 and was significantly lower than in lp 3 55 1 27 kg ha 1 yr 1 table 3 fig 5b slope p 0 01 and season p 0 05 had significant effects on ntf so4 2 s fluxes growing season ntf so4 2 s fluxes 6 47 0 60 kg ha 1 yr 1 in up and 3 45 0 90 kg ha 1 yr 1 in lp was significantly lower than in the dormant season 1 90 1 13 kg ha 1 yr 1 in up and 0 17 0 26 kg ha 1 yr 1 in lp at the two slope plots especially in lp dormant season ntf flux was close to zero table 4 fig 5b 4 discussion 4 1 slope position effects on rainfall partitioning while the spatial variability of rainfall partitioning is frequently reported at tree and plot scales studies that examine its spatial patterns at watershed scale are far less common we thus examined how rainfall partitioning into tf sf and ei along a slope differed in a subtropical evergreen broadleaf forested watershed annual ei rate was 12 2 2 3 in up and 9 2 3 8 in lp table 2 which are in the lower range 7 6 28 8 presented in the study by miralles et al 2010 for evergreen broadleaf forest in field observations however there was no statistically significant difference in ei at the two slope plots this is mainly attributed to no significant difference in plant area index between up and lp table 1 which is a strongly determinant factor of ei crockford and richardson 2000 levia and frost 2006 sun et al 2015 our finding implies that the ei observation in one interception study plot could be representative of the forest watershed but the ei values are somewhat variable manfroi et al 2006 manfroi et al 2006 compared spatial variations of three year ei in a 100 m2 fixed subplot with that estimated in a 4 ha plot of a lowland evergreen tropical forest they found that both the 4 ha plot and the fixed subplot ei values 8 5 and 12 0 respectively were considered to be reliable estimates and the ei values in the 4 ha plot ranged from 5 to 13 with 95 confidence limits which encompass the ei values reported in previous case studies in natural lowland tropical forests in addition less tf amount and more sf amount in up than in lp table 2 are mainly ascribed to greater stem density and higher stem basal area in up table 1 but they did not significantly differ between the two slope plots tf and sf are the two hydrological components responsible for the transfer of water and solutes from tree canopies to forest floor levia and frost 2006 levia and germer 2015 tf is a dominant component of rainfall partitioning sun et al 2017 and annual tf rate were 85 2 in up and 88 6 in lp in the present study table 2 these values were comparable to those 84 4 85 5 in subtropical forest sites of south china fang et al 2008 annual tf rate was significantly negatively correlated with stand density canopy cover and basal area aboal et al 2000 molina and del campo 2012 sun et al 2017 a multiple regression model with input of these commonly stand structural parameters was developed to estimate tf in a temperate coniferous plantation sun et al 2017 which provides potential uses in evaluating the spatial tf patterns at watershed scale and exploiting similar models for other forest ecosystems e g subtropical forests sf represented a small fraction of hydrological input to forest floor and annual sf rate was 2 6 in up and 2 2 in lp in this study table 2 these values agrees with those 1 0 3 9 found in the subtropical forest sites of south china fang et al 2009 and are in range usually 1 10 of other tropical or subtropical forests hofhansl et al 2012 so far sf has been ignored or underrepresented in studies of hydrological and ecological significances in forests even though it constitutes a highly spatially localized input of water and nutrients near tree stems hofhansl et al 2012 levia and germer 2015 future studies should examine the dynamic interplay between sf and stand structures and develop the relationships among them combining with estimation of tf with commonly forest inventories as mentioned above to deepen a better and more accurate understanding of spatial variations in rainfall partitioning in the larger context of watershed hydrology and biogeochemistry 4 2 seasonality effects on no3 and so4 2 concentrations the comparison of annual vwm concentrations revealed to be significantly lower for no3 n in tf and sf than in bp whereas it showed no significant differences for so4 2 s among bp tf and sf table 3 concentrations of no3 n and so4 2 s in the present study are within the range of those measured at forest sites across china no3 n 0 04 2 81 with a mean 0 63 0 09 mg l 1 for bp and 0 06 4 55 with mean 1 05 0 17 mg l 1 for tf n 43 so4 2 s 0 07 12 27 with mean 3 24 0 46 mg l 1 for bp and 0 04 24 26 with mean of 5 50 0 87 mg l 1 for tf n 40 du 2018 indeed sf no3 n and so4 2 s concentrations are reported much less and are slightly lower compared to bp which may to a greater extent be ascribed to microbial immobilization within the crown or capture by epiphytic lichens e g chiwa et al 2003 rodrigo et al 2003 liu et al 2004 reflecting uptake processes rather than dry deposition in this study site see section 4 3 for details both no3 n and so4 2 s concentrations exhibited similar seasonality in tf and sf with those in bp fig 3 seasonally dormant season no3 n and so4 2 s were more concentrated in these rainfall partitioning components than in growing season table 4 fig 3a and b during the growing season canopy uptake of n and s occurs when phyllosphere mosses lichens and microorganisms remove n and s from tf and sf solutions knops et al 1996 rodrigo et al 2003 siegert et al 2017 while during the dormant season phyllosphere activity is dormant so canopy fluxes are relatively enriched with n and s through leaching ignatova and dambrine 2000 besides the increased roughness of leafless canopies aides in scavenging n and s dry deposition from these increased emissions from combustion of fossil fuel for heating purposes du et al 2014 that is washed out in less and small rainfall events before the sampling in the dormant season in this study dormant season bp amount only accounted for 25 of annual bp amount with more small rainfall events table 2 fig 3c small rainfall events usually have higher solutes concentrations because leaching and washing of canopies are larger at the beginning of a storm whereas larger rainfall events may result in dilution of solutes osaka et al 2016 biological nitrification in forest canopies may also result in tf no3 n concentrations higher during the dormant season under high n deposition guerrieri et al 2015 combined multiple isotope tracers and quantified for the first time the large fraction 17 59 of tf no3 which derived from nitrification occurring in tree canopies at scots pine and beech stands under high n deposition in the united kingdom these reasons may cause seasonality remarkable effects on no3 and so4 2 concentrations in these interception components 4 3 slope position effects on no3 and so4 2 fluxes despite higher concentrations of no3 n and so4 2 s in tf and sf during the dormant season these hydrochemical no3 n and so4 2 s fluxes were larger during the growing season suggesting that the amount of rainwater is an overriding factor and a main source in tf and sf no3 n and so4 2 s deposition fluxes levia and frost 2006 analysis of slope position effects showed that both tf no3 n and so4 2 s fluxes were slightly or significantly lower in up than in lp but sf no3 n and so4 2 s fluxes were quite similar between the slopes at the annual and season scales table 4 fig 4 these differences are mainly ascribed to differences in wash off of particles and dissolution of aerosols that have accumulated on canopy surfaces between events and canopy exchange that includes leaching of internal material from plant tissues and leaf surfaces and active uptake of ions in rainfall by leaves or epiphytic flora hofhansl et al 2011 salehi et al 2016 siegert et al 2017 rather than to differences in tf and sf amounts between slope plots table 2 site characteristics e g elevation slope and aspect are greatly related to altitude and exposure to wind rainfall aerosols influencing microclimate and deposition velocity hofhansl et al 2011 we found increased dry deposition to up where ntf of sodium 1 25 0 23 kg ha 1 yr 1 was higher than in lp 0 72 0 17 kg ha 1 yr 1 sun et al submitted for publication but the tf no3 n and so4 2 s fluxes in up were lower than in lp table 4 fig 4 these indicate that exchange with foliage surfaces should be the dominant factor controlling the spatial patterns of tf no3 and so4 2 fluxes in the watershed in the present study for no3 and so4 2 dry deposition is generally the main contributing source of tf deposition and is primarily from industrial and transportation fossil fuel combustion the study was conducted in the absence of any major anthropogenic or oceanic sources nearby the fact that ntf s fluxes in up and lp were very close to zero fig 5b also indicating that dry deposition does not appear to play a major role in this study area on the contrary at the pollution exposed site the contribution of washout scavenging processes and dry deposition is higher than at the remote site chiwa et al 2003 rodrigo et al 2003 for example chiwa et al 2003 reported the fluxes of no3 and so4 2 in tf and sf were higher at the mountain facing slope i e away from the urban areas than at the urban facing slope i e near the traffic roads and urban areas in japanese pine forests in western japan therefore our findings have important implications for evaluation of the external and internal cycling of n and s in forest ecosystems and highlight the need for additional consideration of pollution condition on the effect of site characteristics on tf and sf hydrochemistry along topographic positions within a watershed annual tf sf no3 n and so4 2 s fluxes in the present study are in the low range of values reported for china s forest sites no3 n 0 81 55 74 with mean of 10 19 1 75 kg ha 1 n 43 so4 2 s 0 20 240 03 with mean of 70 64 9 93 kg ha 1 n 40 du 2018 as a consequence of n and s emission reduction measures and economic transformation the so2 emissions have been successfully curbed in china lu et al 2011 but the role of atmospheric no3 deposition is continuously enhanced and is increasingly important now and into future although chinese n deposition tend towards levelling or declining yu et al 2019 additionally annual ntf values were negative for no3 n and so4 2 s at both slope plots fig 5 this result illustrates that there is retained or taken up by the foliage or by the epiphytic flora in the studied site meaning atmospheric n and s deposition fluxes were reduced through canopy passage into forest floor similar results were reported in earlier literatures e g ignatova and dambrine 2000 dezzeo and chacon 2006 sparks 2009 ponette gonz√°lez et al 2017 su et al 2019 conversely a number of observations have also reported positive annual ntf no3 n and so4 2 s values meaning atmospheric n and s deposition fluxes were enhanced passing through canopy into forest floor e g berger et al 2008 du et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 it is thus important to note that tf sf fluxes are not a reliable measure of atmospheric n and s deposition because of canopy exchange processes i e uptake and leaching but are used to measure n and s flux to forest floor which are also pointed out by previous studies e g sparks 2009 du et al 2014 canopy modification effects are site specific and vary in space and time it remains to be discriminated what dominant factors and processes occurring within the canopy influence the direction and magnitude of ntf fluxes among different forest sites such examinations are crucial to assess the consequent impacts on spatial patterns of water and soil acidification at regional and global scales and to facilitate both forest management and better understanding of the structure and function of forest ecosystems responding to recent patterns of environmental changes 5 conclusions this study examined how rainfall partitioning into tf sf and ei and associated no3 n and so4 2 s fluxes varied between up and lp in a subtropical broadleaved forest the up had slightly higher ei less tf amount and more sf amount than those in lp which were attributed to increased plant area index greater stem density and higher stem basal area in up but they did not significantly differ between the two slope plots despite higher concentrations of no3 n and so4 2 s in tf and sf during the dormant season these hydrochemical no3 n and so4 2 s fluxes were larger during the growing season suggesting that the amount of rainwater is an overriding factor and a main source in no3 n and so4 2 s deposition fluxes of tf and sf analysis of slope position effects showed that both tf no3 n and so4 2 s fluxes were lower in up than in lp but sf no3 n and so4 2 s fluxes were quite similar between the slopes at the annual growing season and dormant season scales this study was conducted in the absence of any major anthropogenic or oceanic sources nearby and dormant season ntf s fluxes in up and lp were close to zero indicating that dry deposition does not appear to play a major role in this study area whereas exchange with foliage surfaces should be the dominant factor controlling the spatial patterns of tf n and s fluxes in the watershed additionally annual ntf values were negative for no3 n and so4 2 s at both slope plots illustrating uptake in the canopy however the direction and magnitude of ntf fluxes differ among different forest sites future research is required to determine what dominant factors and processes occurring within the canopy influence them given how watershed scale fluxes of water n and s through canopy passage into forest floor this study can contribute to the evaluation of spatial patterns of water and soil

5125,forest canopies create a high spatial variability of both canopy interception ei and acid deposition however spatial characteristics of these hydrochemical fluxes along a slope gradient in forest watersheds remain unclear here we monitored bulk precipitation bp throughfall tf stemflow sf and associated nitrate no3 and sulfate so4 2 in an upper slope plot up and a lower slope plot lp in a subtropical broadleaved forest southeast china results showed that annual rates of tf sf and ei to bp in up were 85 2 2 6 and 12 2 respectively corresponding values in lp were 88 6 2 2 and 9 2 there were no significant differences among these rainfall partitioning components between up and lp additionally annual volume weighted mean concentrations of no3 n in tf and sf were significantly lower than in bp whereas no significant differences were found for so4 2 s among bp tf and sf unlike annual tf no3 n fluxes were similar in up and lp annual tf so4 2 s fluxes significantly increased along the up to lp net tf sf ntf fluxes were negative for no3 n and so4 2 s at the two slope plots illustrating retained uptake in the canopy dormant season ntf s fluxes were close to zero indicating that dry deposition does not appear to play a major role whereas exchange with foliage surfaces should be the dominant factor controlling the spatial patterns of tf n and s fluxes in the watershed this

assess the spatial distribution of water and acidifying input into the soil and further the consequent effects on hydrological biogeochemical and ecological cycling in forest ecosystems there is a large body of scientific work examining the hydrochemical characteristics and spatial variability of tf and sf at tree levels beier et al 1993 zhang et al 2019 fathizadeh et al 2020 in pure and or mixed stands berger et al 2008 zimmermann et al 2008 legout et al 2016 salehi et al 2016 along an urbanization gradient fang et al 2011 rao et al 2013 ponette gonz√°lez et al 2017 and in different land use types dezzeo and chacon 2006 macinnis ng et al 2012 for different tree species around the world for example an urban suburban rural gradient study found that tf no3 n fluxes increased along a suburban to urban to rural gradient in tropical and subtropical forests fang et al 2011 salehi et al 2016 reported that tf no3 n fluxes were higher in the mixed stand fagus orientalis lipsky carpinus betulus l and acer velutinum boiss than in the pure stand of oriental beech f orientalis zhang et al 2019 found tf so4 2 fluxes were higher at the gap edge than in the closed canopy especially near the trunk in a subalpine spruce picea asperata mast plantation additionally tf and sf chemistry esp no3 and so4 2 are strongly influenced by tree species through different scavenging of atmospheric dry deposition and canopy exchanges de schrijver et al 2007 legout et al 2016 compared to deciduous forests coniferous canopies tend to enhance acid deposition through more efficiently scavenge dry deposition of no3 and so4 2 de schrijver et al 2007 despite these important findings in previous studies there is a paucity of data depicting how these hydrochemical fluxes via tf and sf vary along slope gradients within forest watershed although it may have important implications for sampling strategy and interpretation of average deposition fluxes to forest floor in forest watershed the deliveries of tf and sf fluxes are affected by site characteristics e g elevation slope and aspect within the watershed which directly influence microclimate deposition velocity and soil fertility across topographic gradients rodrigo et al 2003 hofhansl et al 2011 2012 macinnis ng et al 2012 siegert et al 2016 site located at higher elevations may be capable of generating greater tf amount and enhanced dry deposition especially those above the average cloud base holder 2004 hofhansl et al 2011 found dry deposition was increased at the ridge forest compared to at the ravine site in a tropical lowland rainforest slope and aspect are main controls of species composition that led to differences in tf amount siegert et al 2016 found tf amount was significantly lower on the steepest plot than on the moderately sloping plots in a temperate deciduous forest if tf and sf fluxes vary along a slope the effect of site characteristics will likely make scaling in a forest watershed more complicated and increase the uncertainties in evaluating the internal processes and cycling in forest ecosystems nevertheless the hydrochemical characteristics and spatial patterns of rainfall partitioning and associated no3 and so4 2 fluxes at different slope positions within a watershed has not received much attention and remains unclear tropical and subtropical forests are more vulnerable to atmospheric deposition compared to temperate forests because they are strongly weathered with low base cations soils and poorly buffered against acid deposition bruijnzeel 1991 fang et al 2011 homeier et al 2012 until now comparable data are still needed for the effect of acid deposition on tropical and subtropical forests fang et al 2008 hofhansl et al 2011 lu et al 2014 yu et al 2018 additionally china is one of the three regions with the highest nitrogen deposition in the world particularly in southern china du et al 2014 yu et al 2019 acid deposition leads to significant acidification for tropical and subtropical forests lu et al 2014 therefore we conducted tf and sf measurements in upper and lower slope plots in a subtropical montane forest southeast china we hypothesized that the upper slope plot would exhibit increased fluxes of no3 and so4 2 in tf and sf as result of higher dry deposition therefore the aims of the present study were to 1 quantify and compare the differences in rainfall partitioning and associated no3 and so4 2 fluxes at the two slope positions and 2 examine the effects of site morphological characteristics and seasonality on these hydrochemical fluxes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site is located within a watershed 7 8 ha in national nature reserve wuyi mountains in the north part of fujian province southeast china 27 33 27 54 n 117 27 117 5 e 450 m a s l this reserve is about 50 km south of nanping city and about 260 km southeast of the capital city fuzhou the reserve has a humid warm subtropical monsoon climate featuring abundant precipitation and full sunshine the mean annual temperature between 1995 and 2014 at the nearest wuyishan national weather station was 14 2 c and the annual mean relative humidity was 83 5 the mean annual precipitation was 2583 mm with a distant seasonal pattern 60 falling from later april to august leaf emergence starts in may with the growing season lasting through october when senescence starts the dormant season is categorized as november through april the topography is highly heterogeneous with slopes ranging from 15 to 35 the soil is lateritic red earth formed from sandstone two study plots an upper slope plot up and a lower slope plot lp were randomly established in the watershed for study distance between up and lp was approximately 185 m apart the two plots were located on a south facing slope with a slope of approximate 30 plots were set up in triplicate as squares of 10 20 m separated by a distance of approximately 10 m the dominated evergreen and deciduous broadleaved tree species were castanopsis carlesii castanopsis faberi castanopsis eyrei castanopsis fordii symplocos congesta symplocos sumuntia and elaeocarpus japonicas inside these plots all trees were inventoried to determine the stand structure variables and species level between 2 0 and 10 cm diameter at breast height dbh and above 10 cm dbh table 1 stem density stems ha 1 and basal area m2 ha 1 were estimated by individual numbers and dbh in the plots plant area index was determined from the total vertical canopy projection area divided by the plot area fisher s alpha index was calculated as an indicator of species diversity by the number of species and the number of individuals in those species with an open javascript program http groundvegetationdb web com ground veg home diversity index 2 2 sample collection and analysis bp tf and sf were measured and sampled from november 2014 to november 2015 three collectors consisting of a 29 cm diameter funnel connected to a 20 l polyethylene bottle were used for sampling bp these collectors were placed at a clearing site with an area of 780 m2 located approximately 300 m away from the two slope plots the water volumes in the three collectors were measured manually using a graduated cylinder and then combined to provide a composited sample at rainfall event sampling the funnels and bottles were rinsed with deionized water after each collection tf and sf were sampled in the triplicate plots in up and lp three tf collectors consisting of a 26 cm diameter funnel connected to 15 l polyethylene bottle were randomly placed in each plot these collectors were fixed at 1 5 m height aboveground each bottle was covered by aluminium paper and each funnel had a ping pong ball as a plastic float to prevent contamination by coarse debris and water evaporation during and between sampling intervals during the study period approximately 10 samples were lost due to litterfall and funnel clogging the water volumes in the collectors were measured using a graduated cylinder on an event basis and pooled in the field to a single composited sample per plot after each sampling the funnels and bottles were thoroughly rinsed with distilled water in addition sf was sampled in three trees in each repetitive plot in up and lp the sampled trees consisted of the dominant tree species in the study site with a mean dbh of 21 6 cm 13 4 33 6 cm the sampled tree was equipped with a flexible tubing around the trunk at about 1 3 m height with a draining hole connected to a 80 l bucket the tubing was stapled to the tree trunk and silicone sealant was applied sealing the collar to the trunk to avoid sf losses the collectors were bulk in proportion to the collected volume into a single composited sample per plot and were cleaned with deionized water after each collection the water volume accumulated by each sampled tree was measured from each plot the sf water depth mm was computed using the following equation hanchi and rapp 1997 1 sf i 1 n v n m a 10 4 where vn is the average volume ml from sampled trees in a certain dbh class a is the plot area m2 n is the number of dbh classes and m is number of trees belonging to a certain dbh class in the plot fig 1 a 250 ml subsamples of bp tf and sf were taken to the laboratory and refrigerated at 4 c within 48 h of collection the samples were filtered through a 0 45 Œºm non phosphorus filter and then measured by ion chromatography to determine the concentrations mg l 1 of no3 and so4 2 volume weighted mean vwm was used to express mean concentrations of no3 and so4 2 in bp tf and sf of individual events zimmermann et al 2008 hofhansl et al 2012 2 v w m n 1 i c i v i n 1 i v i where ci and vi are the concentration and volume at collector i for a given event the event based fluxes of no3 and so4 2 were calculated by multiplying vwm ion concentrations with the corresponding water volumes of bp tf and sf yearly and seasonal deposition fluxes kg ha 1 were obtained as the product of these vwm concentrations and the corresponding annual seasonal water volume net tf sf flux ntf integrated dry deposition and canopy exchange processes and was also calculated by subtracting the fluxes of tf and sf from bp additionally a rainfall event was defined as a period 2 mm of gross rainfall two subsequent events were isolated by 24 h of dry period canopy interception ei during and after a rainfall event was then calculated using the water balance of rainfall partitioning crockford and richardson 2000 sun et al 2015 3 ei t f s f b p 2 3 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were conducted in r 3 6 3 r core team 2020 linear mixed models using the nlme package pinheiro et al 2020 were used to analyze the effect of slope i e up and lp season i e growing and dormant and slope by season interaction on the concentrations of no3 and so4 2 in tf and sf in addition to the fluxes of water no3 and so4 2 in tf sf and ntf slope and season were fixed factors while subplot location was a random factor post hoc comparisons were tested using tukey s hsd when significant differences between means were detected differences in stand structure variables concentration and fluxes between up and lp among seasons were tested by one way anova with tukey s hsd statistically significant

are shown at annual and season growing and dormant scales in table 2 the annual amount of bp was 2623 7 mm obtained from a total of 21 rainfall events ranging from 10 6 mm to 287 7 mm event based tf and sf in up and lp increased linearly with bp with an r 2 values of 0 99 and 0 84 respectively by the least squares method fig 2 rainfall was highly seasonal with most of the rain falling during the growing season 1950 mm 74 3 of bp while dormant season rainfall was 673 7 mm accounting for 25 7 of bp table 2 the annual tf amount was 2235 7 58 0 mm 85 2 2 2 of bp and 2323 1 78 7 mm 88 6 3 0 of bp

two fold higher in up and four fold higher in lp compared to the growing season table 4 in addition the sf no3 n concentrations differed significantly between seasons p 0 01 dormant season sf no3 n concentration was more than two fold higher compared to the growing season at the two slope plots while there was no slope effect or slope by season interaction table 4 unlike no3 n although annual vwm concentrations of so4 2 s in bp was slightly higher than in tf and sf in both up and lp there were no significant differences among them table 3 the so4 2 s concentrations in these hydrochemical fluxes also exhibited clear seasonal trends fig 3b the bp so4 2 s concentration was higher in the dormant season 1 42 mg l 1 than in the growing season 0 84 mg l 1 table 4 season p 0 01 had significant effects on tf and sf so4 2 s concentrations during the dormant season tf and sf so4 2 s concentrations were more than two fold higher except for sf in up 1 8 fold than during the growing season in up and lp however slope or slope by season had no significant effects table 4 3 3 fluxes of no3 and so4 2 in bp tf and sf the up and lp received similar fluxes of tf no3 n deposition with 6

between seasons p 0 06 but there was slope by season interaction p 0 01 table 4 fig 4a dormant season tf no3 n fluxes were significantly lower in up than in lp but growing season differences between the two slopes were not significant the annual sf no3 n fluxes were very small with 0 20 0 02 kg ha 1 yr 1 in up and 0 16 0 03 kg ha 1 yr 1 in lp table 3 and did not differ significantly p 0 05 between slopes or between seasons in addition to no slope by season interaction table 4 fig 4a furthermore the annual ntf no3 n fluxes were similar and negative in up 13 66 0 65 kg ha 1 yr 1 and lp 11

season at the two slope plots particularly dormant season ntf fluxes was significantly lower in up than in lp table 4 fig 5a annual tf so4 2 s fluxes significantly p 0 001 increased along the up 17 18

fluxes but there was no slope by season interaction table 4 fig 4b growing season tf so4 2 s fluxes were significantly lower in up than in lp the annual sf so4 2 s fluxes were also very small with 0 58 0 02 kg ha 1 yr 1 in up and 0 45 0 16 kg ha 1 yr 1 in lp table 3 and did not differ between slopes or between seasons in addition to no slope by season interaction table 4 fig 4b furthermore the annual ntf so4 2 s fluxes in up were 8 74 0 49 kg ha 1 yr 1 and was significantly lower than in lp 3 55 1 27 kg ha 1 yr 1 table 3 fig 5b slope p 0 01 and season p 0 05 had significant effects on ntf

0 26 kg ha 1 yr 1 in lp at the two slope plots especially in lp dormant season ntf flux was close to zero table 4 fig 5b 4 discussion 4 1 slope position effects on rainfall partitioning while the spatial variability of rainfall partitioning is frequently reported at tree and plot scales studies that examine its spatial patterns at watershed scale are far less common we thus examined how rainfall partitioning into tf sf and ei along a slope differed in a subtropical evergreen broadleaf forested watershed annual ei rate was 12 2 2 3 in up and 9 2 3 8 in lp table 2 which are in the lower range 7 6 28 8 presented in the study by miralles et al 2010 for evergreen broadleaf forest in field observations however there was no statistically significant difference in ei at the two slope plots this is mainly attributed to no significant difference in plant area index between up and lp table 1 which is a strongly determinant factor of ei crockford and richardson 2000 levia and frost 2006 sun et al 2015 our finding implies that the ei observation in one interception study plot could be representative of the forest watershed but the ei values are somewhat variable manfroi et al 2006 manfroi et al 2006 compared spatial variations of three year ei in a 100 m2 fixed subplot with that estimated in a 4 ha plot of a lowland evergreen tropical forest they found that both the 4 ha plot and the fixed subplot ei values 8 5 and 12 0 respectively were considered to be reliable estimates and the ei values in the 4 ha plot ranged from 5 to 13 with 95 confidence limits which encompass the ei values reported in previous case studies in natural lowland tropical forests in addition less tf amount and more sf amount in up than in lp table 2 are mainly ascribed to greater stem density and higher stem basal area in up table 1 but they did not significantly differ between the two slope plots tf and sf are the two hydrological components responsible for the transfer of water and solutes from tree canopies to forest floor levia and frost 2006 levia and germer 2015 tf is a dominant component of rainfall partitioning sun et al 2017 and annual tf rate were 85 2 in up and 88 6 in lp in the present study table 2 these values were comparable to those 84 4 85 5 in subtropical forest sites of south china fang et al 2008 annual tf rate was significantly negatively correlated with stand density canopy cover and basal area aboal et al 2000 molina and del campo 2012 sun et al 2017 a multiple regression model with input of these commonly stand structural parameters was developed to estimate tf in a temperate coniferous plantation sun et al 2017 which provides potential uses in evaluating the spatial tf patterns at watershed scale and exploiting similar models for other forest ecosystems e g subtropical forests sf represented a small fraction of hydrological input to forest floor and annual sf rate was 2 6 in up and 2 2 in lp in this study table 2 these values agrees with those 1 0 3 9 found in the subtropical forest sites of south china fang et al 2009 and are in range usually 1 10 of other tropical or subtropical forests hofhansl et al 2012 so far sf has been ignored or underrepresented in studies of hydrological and ecological significances in forests even though it constitutes a highly spatially localized input of water and nutrients near tree stems hofhansl et al 2012 levia and germer 2015 future studies should examine the dynamic interplay between sf and stand structures and develop the relationships among them combining with estimation of tf with commonly forest inventories as mentioned above to deepen a better and more accurate understanding of spatial variations in rainfall partitioning in the larger context of watershed hydrology and biogeochemistry 4 2 seasonality effects on no3 and so4 2 concentrations the comparison of annual vwm concentrations revealed to be significantly lower for no3 n in tf and sf than in bp whereas it showed no significant differences for so4 2 s among bp tf and sf table 3 concentrations of no3 n and so4 2 s in the present study are within the range of those measured at forest sites across china no3 n 0 04 2 81 with a mean 0 63 0 09 mg l 1 for bp and 0 06 4 55 with mean 1 05 0 17 mg l 1 for tf n 43 so4 2 s 0 07 12 27 with mean 3 24 0 46 mg l 1 for bp and 0 04 24 26 with mean of 5 50 0 87 mg l 1 for tf n 40 du 2018 indeed sf no3 n and so4 2 s concentrations are reported much less and are slightly lower compared to bp which may to a greater extent be ascribed to microbial immobilization within the crown or capture by epiphytic lichens e g chiwa et al 2003 rodrigo et al 2003 liu et al 2004 reflecting uptake processes rather than dry deposition in this study site see section 4 3 for details both no3 n and so4 2 s concentrations exhibited similar seasonality in tf and sf with those in bp fig 3 seasonally dormant season no3 n and so4 2 s were more concentrated in these rainfall partitioning components than in growing season table 4 fig 3a and b during the growing season canopy uptake of n and s occurs when phyllosphere mosses lichens and microorganisms remove n and s from tf and sf solutions knops et al 1996 rodrigo et al 2003 siegert et al 2017 while during the dormant season phyllosphere activity is dormant so canopy fluxes are relatively enriched with n and s through leaching ignatova and dambrine 2000 besides the increased roughness of leafless canopies aides in scavenging n and s dry deposition from these increased emissions from combustion of fossil fuel for heating purposes du et al 2014 that is washed out in less and small rainfall events before the sampling in the dormant season in this study dormant season bp amount only accounted for 25 of annual bp amount with more small rainfall events table 2 fig 3c small rainfall events usually have higher solutes concentrations because leaching and washing of canopies are larger at the beginning of a storm whereas larger rainfall events may result in dilution of solutes osaka et al 2016 biological nitrification in forest canopies may also result in tf no3 n concentrations higher during the dormant season under high n deposition guerrieri et al 2015 combined multiple isotope tracers and quantified for the first time the large fraction 17 59 of tf no3 which derived from nitrification occurring in tree canopies at scots pine and beech stands under high n deposition in the united kingdom these reasons may cause seasonality remarkable effects on no3 and so4 2 concentrations in these interception components 4 3 slope position effects on no3 and so4 2 fluxes despite higher concentrations of no3 n and so4 2 s in tf and sf during the dormant season these hydrochemical no3 n and so4 2 s fluxes were larger during the growing season suggesting that the amount of rainwater is an overriding factor and a main source in tf and sf no3 n and so4 2 s deposition fluxes levia and frost 2006 analysis of slope position effects showed that both tf no3 n and so4 2 s fluxes were slightly or significantly lower in up than in lp but sf no3 n and so4 2 s fluxes were quite similar between the slopes at the annual and season scales table 4 fig 4 these differences are mainly ascribed to differences in wash off of particles and dissolution of aerosols that have accumulated on canopy surfaces between events and canopy exchange that includes leaching of internal material from plant tissues and leaf surfaces and active uptake of ions in rainfall by leaves or epiphytic flora hofhansl et al 2011 salehi et al 2016 siegert et al 2017 rather than to differences in tf and sf amounts between slope plots table 2 site characteristics e g elevation slope and aspect are greatly related to altitude and exposure to wind rainfall aerosols influencing microclimate and deposition velocity hofhansl et al 2011 we found increased dry deposition to up where ntf of sodium 1 25 0 23 kg ha 1 yr 1 was higher than in lp 0 72 0 17 kg ha 1 yr 1 sun et al submitted for publication but the tf no3 n and so4 2 s fluxes in up were lower than in lp table 4 fig 4 these indicate that exchange with foliage surfaces should be the dominant factor controlling the spatial patterns of tf no3 and so4 2 fluxes in the watershed in the present study for no3 and so4 2 dry deposition is generally the main contributing source of tf deposition and is primarily from industrial and transportation fossil fuel combustion the study was conducted in the absence of any major anthropogenic or oceanic sources nearby the fact that ntf s fluxes in up and lp were very close to zero fig 5b also indicating that dry deposition does not appear to play a major role in this study area on the contrary at the pollution exposed site the contribution of washout scavenging processes and dry deposition is higher than at the remote site chiwa et al 2003 rodrigo et al 2003 for example chiwa et al 2003 reported the fluxes of no3 and so4 2 in tf and sf were higher at the mountain facing slope i e away from the urban areas than at the urban facing slope i e near the traffic roads and urban areas in japanese pine forests in western japan therefore our findings have important implications for evaluation of the external and internal cycling of n and s in forest ecosystems and highlight the need for additional consideration of pollution condition on the effect of site characteristics on tf and sf hydrochemistry along topographic positions within a watershed annual tf sf no3 n and so4 2 s fluxes in the present study are in the low range of values reported for china s forest sites no3 n 0 81 55 74 with mean of 10 19 1 75 kg ha 1 n 43 so4 2 s 0 20 240 03 with mean of 70 64 9 93 kg ha 1 n 40 du 2018 as a consequence of n and s emission reduction measures and economic transformation the so2 emissions have been successfully curbed in china lu et al 2011 but the role of atmospheric no3 deposition is continuously enhanced and is increasingly important now and into future although chinese n deposition tend towards levelling or declining yu et al 2019 additionally annual ntf values were negative for no3 n and so4 2 s at both slope plots fig 5 this result illustrates that there is retained or taken up by the foliage or by the epiphytic flora in the studied site meaning atmospheric n and s deposition fluxes were reduced through canopy passage into forest floor similar results were reported in earlier literatures e g ignatova and dambrine 2000 dezzeo and chacon 2006 sparks 2009 ponette gonz√°lez et al 2017 su et al 2019 conversely a number of observations have also reported positive annual ntf no3 n and so4 2 s values meaning atmospheric n and s deposition fluxes were enhanced passing through canopy into forest floor e g berger et al 2008 du et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 it is thus important to note that tf sf fluxes are not a reliable measure of atmospheric n and s deposition because of canopy exchange processes i e uptake and leaching but are used to measure n and s flux to forest floor which are also pointed out by previous studies e g sparks 2009 du et al 2014 canopy modification effects are site specific and vary in space and time it remains to be discriminated what dominant factors and processes occurring within the canopy influence the direction and magnitude of ntf fluxes among different forest sites such examinations are crucial to assess the consequent impacts on spatial patterns of water and soil acidification at regional and global scales and to facilitate both forest management and better understanding of the structure and function of forest ecosystems responding to recent patterns of environmental changes 5 conclusions this study examined how rainfall partitioning into tf sf and ei and associated no3 n and so4 2 s fluxes varied between up and lp in a subtropical broadleaved forest the up had slightly higher ei less tf amount and more sf amount than those in lp which were attributed to increased plant area index greater stem density and higher stem basal area in up but they did not significantly differ between the two slope plots despite higher concentrations of no3 n and so4 2 s in tf and sf during the dormant season these hydrochemical no3 n and so4 2 s fluxes were larger during the growing season suggesting that the amount of rainwater is an overriding factor and a main source in no3 n and so4 2 s deposition fluxes of tf and sf analysis of slope position effects showed that both tf no3 n and so4 2 s fluxes were lower in up than in lp but sf no3 n and so4 2 s fluxes were quite similar between the slopes at the annual growing season and dormant season scales this study was conducted in the absence of any major anthropogenic or oceanic sources nearby and dormant season ntf s fluxes in up and lp were close to zero indicating that dry deposition does not appear to play a major role in this study area whereas exchange with foliage surfaces should be the dominant factor controlling the spatial patterns of tf n and s fluxes in the watershed additionally annual ntf values were negative for no3 n and so4 2 s at both slope plots illustrating uptake in the canopy however the direction and magnitude of ntf fluxes differ among different forest sites future research is required to determine what dominant factors and processes occurring within the canopy influence them given how watershed scale fluxes of water n and s through canopy passage into forest floor this study can contribute to the evaluation of spatial patterns of water and soil acidification in the watershed and also to better guide forest management options credit authorship contribution statement xiaoqiang lu data curation investigation methodology writing original draft

5126,the aim of this study is to investigate the regional hydrogeochemical spatialization and controls of the serra geral aquifer system sgas a transboundary fractured aquifer across the southern region of brazil an extensive dataset of 1564 groundwater wells represented by 16 attributes was analyzed to identify spatial patterns and groups with similar hydrogeochemical facies an unsupervised machine learning approach self organizing maps som was used in combination with k means clustering to carry out the analysis som produces two dimensional representations allowing visual interpretation of nonlinear relationships between the attributes the stochastic davies bouldin index pointed out to an optimal number of four clusters highlighting significant differences in geochemistry cluster 1 is the most abundant and widespread corresponding to meteoric recharge cluster 2 is influenced by the weathering of basaltic rocks being widely distributed but with a higher density at the southeastern region cluster 3 is recognized as a mixing between all the other groups with a sparse distribution mostly in the extreme north of the area cluster 4 is dominated by ascending flow from the underlying sedimentary aquifers occurring in restricted areas this study shows that som can identify large scale spatial hydrogeochemical patterns of the sgas driven by structural and stratigraphic elements keywords serra geral aquifer system sgas regional hydrogeochemistry self organizing maps som k means clustering 1 introduction the serra geral aquifer system sgas is one of the largest and most important sources of groundwater in south america extending through brazil uruguay argentina and paraguay with total area of exposure of 917 000 km2 and a volume greater than 600 000 km3 frank et al 2009 it is a fractured aquifer composed of a cretaceous package of basalts and rhyolites bellieni et al 1984 1986 that can reach a thickness of 1700 m almeida 1986 and has a physical geological continuity through the african continent in the etendeka namibia region common approaches to study large aquifers such as the sgas include spatial visualization and interpretation of clustered hydrogeochemical attributes which are favored by reducing the data dimensionality principal component analysis pca is one of the most used methods e g cloutier et al 2008 owen and cox 2015 peng et al 2015 to reduce large datasets facilitating the investigation of regional aquifer systems pca is a linear technique whose visual outputs are essentially two or three dimensional scatter plots that reflect linear correlations consequently its application to larger and more complex datasets may muddle the detection of clusters the diagrams generated from pca limit the number of comparable attributes implying that datasets of thousands of wells with dozens of attributes cannot be represented by them without a potential significant loss of information astel et al 2007 as an alternative approach to deal with such amount of data there is a growing use of artificial neural networks ann which have been extensively applied in hydrogeology e g choi et al 2014 agoubi 2018 wagh et al 2018 ann are computational models aiming to resemble biological brain behavior through layers of neurons expressed as mathematical functions organized in a network of singular entities haykin 1999 a particular type of ann introduced by kohonen 1982 the self organizing maps som produces a discretized low dimensional usually two dimensional representation of high dimensional input samples the method groups sample vectors into cells using dissimilarity metrics while seeking to maintain the original topological relationship of the input space revealing nonlinear correlations these reduced space representations called component planes can be generated for each attribute making it possible to compare them one by one thus through som it is likely to achieve a better visualization and discretization of large and complex datasets compared to what could be obtained with pca astel et al 2007 as an auxiliary tool to interpret the component planes generated by som the k means clustering has been applied to statistically group similar samples from the obtained outputs e g brentan et al 2018 iwashita et al 2018 the technique allows to mathematically group the samples in an optimal number of clusters which is obtained through a quantitative index because the component planes represent the mean values of the attributes of the set of samples depicted in each cell the k means method efficiently generates clusters from them this way the combined use of som with k means enables an objective discretization and further interpretation of major hydrogeochemical patterns from large multi dimensional aquifer datasets studies that applied som to investigate groundwater properties comprise different spatial scales choi et al 2014 employed the som methodology to discuss the groundwater quality in south korea the authors defined 10 hydrogeochemical parameters from 299 wells spread across all 100 210 km2 of the country s territory to run the algorithm they found representative clusters that reflect the regional controls of groundwater agoubi 2018 performed som with isotopic data from 32 wells from an aquifer in tunisia identifying clusters that denote groundwater mixing processes friedel et al 2020 applied som to predict attributes comparing four learning based methods for groundwater data from new zealand the authors found that a modified som had the best results for prediction in brazil som was used to study groundwater attributes in a central area of the sgas in paran√° state comprising roughly 60 000 km2 friedel and iwashita 2013 analyzed pumping tests terrain morphometry and 10 hydrogeochemical attributes from 333 wells to evaluate spatial continuity of these attributes in the area using semi variograms iwashita et al 2018 used som to characterize the area s hydrogeology applying morphometric gis geophysical well information attributes and 14 hydrogeochemical attributes from 1 132 wells to process the som analysis the authors examined the mixing between the sgas and underlying aquifers the results allowed the identification of seven clusters interpreted to be related to meteoric recharge to typical signatures of the sgas to longer residence times within the sgas and to inputs from underlying aquifers to apply som the input data can be obtained from field and or laboratory analysis which leads to higher costs and demands more time alternatively it can be obtained from previously available databases i e secondary datasets information on geochemical attributes of groundwater wells located in the sgas is freely available at the brazilian geological survey groundwater database siagas http siagasweb cprm gov br thousands of wells related to the sgas are recorded but the data are largely incomplete and present variable levels of quality being necessary an initial filtering for a som analysis the current study aims to understand the spatial occurrence and controlling factors of the regional scale hydrogeochemistry of the sgas in the southern region of brazil across rio grande do sul state using the previously unexplored large dataset of wells from siagas in this area to conduct the investigation two objectives are defined the first is to find correlations between chemical attributes and identify clusters according to differences in these relationships the second is to analyze the spatial distribution of clusters and interpret the controlling factors for it the methodology involves the use of som combined with the k means method to identify such patterns through the identification of the hydrogeochemical regional spatialization and controls a better understanding of the groundwater cycle for the southern portion of the sgas is achieved which is important for the assessment of regional water quality and water management the obtained results support the scalability of som for larger areas and larger datasets and allow the establishment of a workflow to process large hydrogeochemical databases with som and subsequent k means clustering lastly a conceptual model for the sgas dynamics in the study area is suggested 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the region under study is located in rio grande do sul state southern brazil fig 1 corresponding to an area of 135 950 km2 wildner et al 2008 throughout it the sgas is as an unconfined aquifer covering approximately 50 of the entire state area in a region where 80 of the population relies on groundwater as the main water supply nanni et al 2008 and where these volcanic rocks can reach 1 200 m in thickness machado 2005 the primary mineralogy of the sgas rocks consists of plagioclase pyroxene olivine and magnetite for the basaltic portion and plagioclase pyroxene magnetite alkali feldspar and quartz for the rhyolitic part bellieni et al 1984 the sgas overlies the guarani aquifer system gas a giant sedimentary confined aquifer system mostly sandy and porous with subordinate clayish facies ar√∫jo et al 1999 gilboa et al 1976 machado and freitas 2005 sracek and hirata 2002 the gas occurs along the paran√° etendeka basin and in many areas where the volcanic aquifer is not overlaying it the gas is unconfined see in fig 1 the mean thickness of the gas is 100 m reaching up to 600 m machado 2005 underlying the gas there are aquitards and porous aquifers composed of heterogeneous sedimentary permian units overlying all of them porous cenozoic sediments only a few meters thick occur in restricted areas all of these individual reservoirs have singular geological characteristics each one contributing to the groundwater composition with its own chemical attributes groundwater flow and storage in the sgas occur mainly through structural discontinuities mostly subhorizontal fractures in the contacts of volcanic layers but also through subvertical tectonic fractures fernandes et al 2016 the last ones extend to the deeper formations being responsible for hydraulic connections between sgas gas and permian reservoirs which promote groundwater mixing nanni et al 2008 reginato et al 2013 cunha et al 2016 these conditions could explain the different composition values that would be expected for the ubiquitous meteoric recharge in unconfined aquifers where elevated concentrations of sodium chloride fluoride and sulphate are found nanni et al 2008 according to machado 2005 and nanni et al 2008 regional scale tectonic structures divide the study area into major hydrogeological blocks fig 1 these portions are characterized by heterogeneities in terms of fractures and stratigraphy which impact the dynamics of flow these differences end up introducing distinct hydrogeochemical patterns in the groundwater system from the upper volcanic rocks to the underlying sedimentary formations machado 2005 discuss the dissimilarities between the blocks where the western block is characterized by a dominance of northwest fractures with the thickest layers of the gas reaching more than 600 m where the overlying sgas has a mean thickness of 100 m the eastern blocks have a prevalence of northeast structures with thickness for the sgas ranging from a few meters to more than 700 m with the gas ranging from 100 to 200 m the northern block is structurally dominated by northwest and northeast fractures and has the thickest layer of the sgas ranging from 300 to 1 200 m with the gas occurring with a mean thickness of 100 m the central block does not show a preferential direction of fractures with northwest and northeast structures cutting each other where the thickness can reach up to 500 m in the sgas and 400 m in the gas 2 2 data pre processing the hydrogeochemical dataset was obtained from siagas and processed through a series of filters to remove wells that did not meet specifications to allow the qualification of the data in addition because the database has many wells with incomplete data missing values were replaced through an imputation method first data from all wells in the sgas outcrop area were gathered then data were compiled from proximal limits covering areas where the sedimentary formations not only underlies but also overlaps or juxtaposes the sgas due to erosion or tectonism to recognize typologies of mixture between the aquifers the extraction resulted in 15 081 catalogued wells organized by localization hydrogeology and hydrogeochemistry next the first stage to eliminate unsuited data was applied where the wells containing geological profiles comprised of only sedimentary units and that do not intercept the sgas or that were out of the sgas limits were excluded leaving 12 519 wells many of the attributes for each well were missing and further data refinement was required this was firstly made by the definition of target attributes which would be used as input values for the som analysis as essential attributes to hydrogeochemical studies and major constituents in the sgas groundwaters 16 attributes were chosen ph electrical conductivity ec total hardness total dissolved solids tds calcium chloride total iron potassium magnesium sodium nitrate sulphate fluoride manganese bicarbonate and alkalinity from these attributes values equal to 0 or concentrations bellow 0 01 mg l were considered missing values in the last case to avoid values generated by measures bellow detection limits that are not informed at siagas after the filtering wells with values greater than the sum of the attributes mean with three standard deviations were considered extreme values and removed avoiding biasing the som algorithm resulting in 12 257 wells this treatment of discrepant low and high values sought to reduce uncertainty in the data related to the heterogeneity of input sources of siagas and its inherent vulnerability to human error furthermore such values may represent local anomalies that are not within the regional scope of the present study the next step was the removal of wells with more than 6 missing attributes because this is the number where there is an inflection in the quantity of wells with missing data representing a threshold to representativeness and quality of data as a result the number of wells was reduced to 2848 from these although the number of wells with a complete dataset is very low 1 when considering the number of valid values for all wells a wide percentage of the total set is represented 79 a subsequent imputation of the missing values was performed at spss statistics with the multiple imputation tool as described in ibm 2017 with an iterative markov chain monte carlo method 50 sets of values each set consisting of values for all incomplete attributes were generated using a univariate model adjusted with the others attributes as predictors to select the most representative set of imputed values they were split into subsets by attributes and for each attribute the subset with the lowest absolute value of s was chosen s was defined as the difference between the attribute arithmetic mean of the imputed values and the original values am i o and of the original values only am o added to the difference between the attribute standard deviations of the imputed values and the original values sd i o and of the original values only sd o as shown in 1 1 s n am i o am o sd i o sd o 1 n 50 at the end of wells selection phase and after the imputation procedure charge balance errors cbe were calculated 2 removing wells with absolute value of error greater than 10 as a final outcome 1 564 wells remained shown in fig 1 for an initial number of 15 081 which then were used as inputs for the som algorithm 2 c b e c a t i o n s a n i o n s c a t i o n s a n i o n s 100 i o n s i n meq l 2 3 self organizing maps with the filtered and imputed data the som algorithm was processed at matlab software using the extension som toolbox vesanto et al 2000 the processing starts with the input data a dataset of cases and their attributes in this study the cases were the groundwater wells and the attributes were the 16 hydrogeochemical parameters defined in the pre processing phase following a number of iterative steps the position of each case is adjusted in a dimensionally reduced representation of a grid made up by nodes known as component planes in a manner that approximates cases with similarity in their attributes values in the same nodes or in its neighborhood kohonen 1990 by the tool default the grid size equals the best approximation to a value five times the square root of the number of cases and as discussed by kohonen 2013 it is optimally distributed in a number of rows and columns that correspond to the ratio between the two largest principal components of the data for each attribute one component plane is generated and for the same node position in every component plane the same cases are depicted vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 the position adjustment is made by calculating the value of the best matching unit bmu for each attribute at each step and used to best fit the case in the available nodes vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 after all iterations are concluded the output is an organized low dimensional representation of the dataset a bidimensional image colorized according to the mean value of the input attribute for the cases within each node a component plane a number of component planes equals to the number of input attributes is generated forming a set of component planes reflecting data original distance between the cases and thus illustrating their correlations in a visually interpretable dimension alhoniemi et al 1999 the processing also creates a u matrix unified distance matrix that represents the distance between neighboring nodes for all attributes where greater values reflect greater dissimilarities kohonen 2013 to avoid the greatest influence of attributes with wider intervals of values in the processing vesanto et al 2000 the values were standardized for each attribute its mean value was subtracted from its original values and divided by its standard deviation this process was also made with the som toolbox extension 2 4 k means clustering for clustering the k means method was assigned and processed with tools available at som toolbox vesanto et al 2000 the technique is an iterative clustering algorithm firstly proposed by macqueen 1967 that aims to partition data space into k clusters where each case is attributed to the group with the closest mean this results in a segmentation of the cases according to the distances between the values of their attributes the method divides a dataset in a predetermined number of clusters according to their centers that are randomly initialized minimizing the squared error function between the center of a cluster and its cases jain 2010 in the present study the cases were represented by vectors from the som results providing cleaner data than the original leading to a simpler clustering process with fewer clusters as result vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 although the number of clusters should be predefined the tool with its stochastic nature which runs several times for each number selecting the one that minimizes the error function due to its random initialization enables the processing of multiple numbers of clusters at each execution thus the optimal number of clusters is evaluated by the calculation of the davies bouldin index dbi for each quantity also performed by the som toolbox dbi quantifies the average similarity between the most similar clusters with lower values meaning greater dissimilarity davies and bouldin 1979 thereby the minimum value represents the best suited number of clusters to divide the data to evaluate the generalizability of clusters obtained through the k means method holdout cross validation on random stratified data splitting was performed the dataset of 1564 wells was split into two subsets 80 20 with each part randomly representing the clusters in the same percentage as in the results from som for the full dataset the 80 part was used to train and generate som with the same attributes as the one for the full dataset the 20 part was used just as testing which was classified in som trained by the 80 part the som results were then clustered by the k means method with the predefined number of four clusters to compare the assignment of clusters of the individual parts with those from the full dataset this procedure was repeated 10 times where a new split was determined in each run the results of this evaluation are matrices that show the number of wells by cluster between the processing of som for the whole dataset and for each part of 80 and 20 additionally the f1 score was calculated for each cluster 3 to evaluate the overall classification considering the sum of the results of multiple runs its values range from 0 to 1 where higher values show a better performance in classification tharwat 2018 3 f 1 s c o r e 2 t p 2 t p f p f n where the variables compare the k means assignment of the whole dataset hypothetically considered as the correct classification with the ones for each part of the dataset in relation to a specific cluster tp true positives is the number of wells from the split dataset with correct classification fp false positives is the number of wells from the split dataset that is wrongly classified and fn false negatives is the number of wells from the split dataset that is incorrectly not assigned to the specified cluster 3 results and discussion 3 1 self organizing maps after testing a series of training steps for the som analysis using a 11 18 grid a stable repetitive result was achieved with the training parameters shown in table 1 generating the maps shown in fig 2 a most nodes have low values for all hydrogeochemical attributes which is illustrated by bluish shades denoting that lower values are the usual for the dataset this is a reflex of meteoric water with low ionic content which is responsible for the largest volume of recharge for the sgas higher values that are illustrated by reddish shades on the other hand occur as isolated portions and because of this are better to correlate the attributes the correlation is made comparing each node located at the same position in all the component planes if the colors match the attributes are positively correlated in the wells represented by the node an inevitable positive correlation between ec and tds is observed as well as for bicarbonate and alkalinity and these two pairs are also related to each other these attributes together mark for the study area conditions evolved waters with longer residence times gastmans et al 2017 they are linked to prolonged water rock interactions that lead to weathering processes in the mineralogy of rocks generating the observed enrichment in these attributes the elevated number of occurrences with higher levels of all these four attributes in two isolated areas in the component planes can indicate two different origins for their inputs one could be related to the weathering of the sgas rocks and the other one to the recharge from the underlying sedimentary formations as further discussed in the following paragraphs exploring the other attributes a positive correlation between chloride fluoride sulphate and sodium is marked with varying degrees of correspondence these elements except sodium are not widely available at sgas mineralogy thus their combination is an indicator of the influence of ascending waters from the sedimentary layers underlying the sgas nanni et al 2009 related to varying piezometric levels of these confined formations that can reach the sgas under favorable structural and topographical conditions machado et al 2002 machado 2005 also marking longer residence times furthermore ec tds bicarbonate and alkalinity are partially correlated with them also pointing to an input from the sedimentary reservoirs calcium magnesium and total hardness are positively correlated since these attributes are not correlated with chloride sodium sulphate and fluoride they should not have the same origin therefore these attributes are probably related to the weathering of the existing minerals in the sgas the primary mineralogy of sgas rocks is composed of these elements pyroxene olivine and plagioclase and thus can be responsible for the presence of these ions gastmans et al 2016 secondary minerals such as calcite occur in the sgas discontinuities murata et al 1987 at the same place where groundwater may flow suggesting another possibility of provenance these reactions also reflect longer residence time gastmans et al 2017 som component planes show that nitrate potassium total iron and manganese are uncorrelated with any other attribute indicating specific controls in their distribution these attributes may be related to urban and agricultural sources palmucci et al 2016 khan et al 2018 and their dissimilar patterns could be related to the heterogeneous distribution of these sources also iron and manganese are related to the weathering of sgas rocks in its weathering mantle facetti masulli et al 2003 indicating a geogenic source regardless of their origin their isolated patterns in the component planes are in accordance with the wide variability of surface situations anthropogenic or natural corroborating the idea of shallow controls at a smaller scale a portion of potassium and total iron is correlated with chloride fluoride sulphate and sodium indicating a possible contribution of the underlying sedimentary sequences for their provenance griffioen 2001 suggests that potassium contribution is related to the occurrence of glauconite an easily dissoluble potassium mineral in marine sedimentary layers this mineral is reported by ng et al 2019 in the underlying permian units the iron input is favored by reducing conditions at higher depths in sedimentary aquifers associated to longer residence times palmucci et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 a high variability was observed for ph which presented only partial correlations with some attributes as ec tds chloride sodium sulphate fluoride bicarbonate and alkalinity this indicates a relationship with the sedimentary units which seems to favor an increase in ph levels as discussed by hirata et al 2011 to explain higher ph values in an occurrence of the gas this association could represent the dissolution of calcite driven by cation exchange at deeper zones of the sedimentary layers where the carbonate is present as interstitial cement 3 2 k means clustering four clusters were identified by the k means method fig 2b as this was the most frequent number with the lowest dbi after calculating the index 50 times with each calculation depicting the best results based on the sum of squared errors for 50 individual runs of the algorithm fig 3 although the clustering technique allowed a mathematical separation observing the u matrix fig 2a the distinction of groups is not visually clear evidencing a smooth transition of the attributes in clusters 1 2 and 3 and on the other hand that cluster 4 has a great variation in its attributes this behavior is not observed in the individual component planes where differences are visible which were recognized through the k means analysis demonstrating the importance of the method for objective data grouping the clustered wells were plotted in georeferenced maps for the analysis of their spatial distributions fig 4 boxplots for all attributes separated by clusters were generated to assist the interpretations fig 5 the evaluation of the identified clusters done by the results from random stratified data sampling table 2 shows that clusters 1 2 and 4 maintained their differentiation between each other with f1 scores for the 80 part of 0 82 0 88 and 0 74 respectively and for the 20 part of 0 81 0 87 and 0 70 in the same previous order on the other hand cluster 3 presented higher levels of error with f1 score of 0 44 for the 80 part and of 0 41 for the 20 part indicating some degree of overlapping of characteristics of this group with the other three at this stage the depth of the wells table 3 is an interesting attribute to correlate with the clusters although not used in the som analysis to maintain geochemical attributes as the only type of input data the depth was kept in the dataset the existence of hydraulic connections between the aquifers in the study area with the deeper wells at the sgas being closer to the underlying sedimentary formations as a general tendency indicates that it is interesting to correlate this attribute with the obtained clusters to investigate the existence of patterns cluster 1 988 wells presents many of the lowest hydrogeochemical attributes values and the largest spatial range occurring in all hydrogeological blocks its composition is consistent with waters from meteoric recharge with short residence times as reinforced by its lowest mean depth exceptions for the low values are elevated levels of total iron potassium nitrate and manganese as previously discussed surface controls could cause punctual higher concentrations of these elements shown by the outlying values in the boxplots supporting the influence of shallow processes in this group cluster 2 341 wells is distinguished by higher values of total hardness calcium magnesium bicarbonate and alkalinity although this cluster is widely distributed it represents the dominant cluster in the southeastern block which is closer to the sgas escarpment where regional groundwater flows converge machado and freitas 2005 characterizing a discharge area these conditions seem to allow prolonged water rock reactions and weathering of the reservoir mineralogy causing an enrichment of these chemical attributes this cluster has a relatively large transition zone from cluster 1 cyan green color in the component planes that together with its composition qualifies this group as a progressive temporal evolution from meteoric waters this idea is supported when comparing the mean depth of both clusters evidencing higher depths for cluster 2 it also shares higher nitrate concentrations with cluster 1 reinforcing their connection possibly as a reflex of the ion persistence in shallow conditions mastrocicco et al 2011 cluster 3 175 wells exhibits attributes with varying intermediate levels from the other groups denoting a composition influenced by mixtures between different reservoirs possibly of contrasting residence times this mixing relationship is also marked by the evaluation of cluster generalizability where this cluster is related to the greatest divergences in the classification results although it is widely distributed except in the western block it is more concentrated at the extreme north of the northern block this region represents an area of ascending recharge from the sedimentary units as demonstrated by the occurrence of thermal waters freitas et al 2016 leading to the mixing of waters its depths are transitional between the shallowest clusters 1 and 2 and the deepest cluster 4 sustaining the hypothesis of a mixed chemistry cluster 4 60 wells has the highest values for attributes as ec tds chloride sodium sulphate and fluoride it also has cases with higher values of ph total hardness calcium bicarbonate and alkalinity all these levels are indicators of an origin from the underlying sedimentary formations corroborated by their higher depths reaching up to 900 m these conditions are related to higher residence times as also shown by the isotopic analyses described by nanni et al 2013 this cluster occurs mainly in three areas the extreme north of the northern block the southeastern blocks and the western block which denotes a relatively low frequency compared with the other clusters probably due to the scarcity of deeper wells the hydrogeochemical properties of each cluster which reflect spatial distribution and geochemical controls allow schematizing a simplified model for the sags regional groundwater cycle shown in fig 6 as a general trend starting from meteoric waters that represent the main recharge for the system the composition may be altered by some punctual shallow processes characterizing cluster 1 with longer water rock interaction and higher depths these waters may evolve with the weathering of sgas lithologies marking cluster 2 or mixing with ionic rich flows from the underlying sedimentary units at variable degrees which distinguishes cluster 3 in particular areas preferentially at the highest depths the water may be widely dominated by inputs from the sedimentary layers typifying cluster 4 the proposed hydrogeochemical interpretation is coherent with the discussion made by iwashita et al 2018 in another area of the sgas whereas the spatial pattern is problematic to correlate due to contrasts in the regional geology the recognized controls are similar despite that the cited study identified a greater number of clusters which is explained by the greater data variability of the more heterogeneous type of attributes that were analyzed likewise the results of the current study are hydrogeochemically congruent to those presented by nanni et al 2009 in a correspondent area of the sgas in which the authors applied pca to a smaller number of wells and attributes also identifying a greater number of clusters in this case the increasing could reflect either the inability of pca to consider nonlinear relationships implying in a greater dissimilarity between the samples or that the regional trend was not highlighted with the reduced amount of data 4 conclusions a methodology combining som and k means clustering is reaffirmed to be an efficient tool to study extensive geochemical datasets from aquifers in large areas allowing the elaboration of simplified models from high dimensional data applying these techniques to a freely available database made possible to explore regional hydrogeochemical relationships for the sgas a consistent training dataset and som model was obtained due to the proposed workflow to filter hydrogeochemical data where a series of steps were applied to minimize the noise and to deal with the incompleteness of the dataset evaluation of the results through dataset splitting and random stratified resampling showed that som and k means produced consistent and robust classification variations in the groundwater chemistry induced the identification of four clusters of wells which explain the sgas dynamics in a simplified way cluster 1 dominated by meteoric waters with some impacts from surface processes cluster 2 evolved from meteoric waters with ion enrichment from the chemical weathering of sgas minerals cluster 3 represented by the mixing of meteoric waters evolved or not and ascending waters from deeper sedimentary layers and cluster 4 characterized by waters with higher ionic contents related to the underlying sedimentary units with low influence of meteoric input the spatial distribution of clusters ranges between the most widely distributed cluster 1 and the most restricted cluster 4 with clusters 2 and 3 at intermediate positions showing specific areas of high densities the heterogeneities in the composition and occurrence of clusters seems to be mainly controlled by the tectonic and stratigraphic framework which are related to the spatial distribution and depth of wells this work observed characteristics related to a regional view of the hydrogeochemical facies of the sgas whereas at a larger scale given the continental dimensions of this aquifer the driving factors can vary locally and regionally leading to a much more complex system while the discussed interpretations may not consider more particular aspects of the hydrogeological process in the sgas we expect that as databases continue to expand with new hydrogeochemical data and new collected variables lidar geophysical radar etc these shortcomings will be resolved allowing to achieve a more detailed model of the sgas through methods suited to cope with big data such as unsupervised machine learning techniques credit authorship contribution statement matheus rossi santos writing original draft

5126,the aim of this study is to investigate the regional hydrogeochemical spatialization and controls of the serra geral aquifer system sgas a transboundary fractured aquifer across the southern region of brazil an extensive dataset of 1564 groundwater wells represented by 16 attributes was analyzed to identify spatial patterns and groups with similar hydrogeochemical facies an unsupervised machine learning approach self organizing maps som was used in combination with k means clustering to carry out the analysis som produces two dimensional representations allowing visual interpretation of nonlinear relationships between the attributes the stochastic davies bouldin index pointed out to an optimal number of four clusters highlighting significant differences in geochemistry cluster 1 is the most abundant and widespread corresponding to meteoric recharge cluster 2 is influenced by the weathering of basaltic rocks being widely distributed but with a higher density at the southeastern region cluster 3 is recognized as a mixing between all the other groups with a sparse distribution mostly in the extreme north of the area cluster 4 is dominated by ascending flow from the underlying sedimentary aquifers occurring in restricted areas this study shows that som can identify large scale spatial hydrogeochemical patterns of the sgas driven by structural and stratigraphic elements keywords serra geral aquifer system sgas regional hydrogeochemistry self organizing maps som k means clustering 1 introduction the serra geral aquifer system sgas is one of the largest and most important sources of groundwater in south america extending through brazil uruguay argentina and paraguay with total area of exposure of 917 000 km2 and a volume greater than 600 000 km3 frank et al 2009 it is a fractured aquifer composed of a cretaceous package of basalts and rhyolites bellieni et al 1984 1986 that can reach a thickness of 1700 m almeida 1986 and has a physical geological continuity through the african continent in the etendeka namibia region common approaches to study large aquifers such as the sgas include spatial visualization and interpretation of clustered hydrogeochemical attributes which are favored by reducing the data dimensionality principal component analysis pca is one of the most used methods e g cloutier et al 2008 owen and cox 2015 peng et al 2015 to reduce large datasets facilitating the investigation of regional aquifer systems pca is a linear technique whose visual outputs are essentially two or three dimensional scatter plots that reflect linear correlations consequently its application to larger and more complex datasets may muddle the detection of clusters the diagrams generated from pca limit the number of comparable attributes implying that datasets of thousands of wells with dozens of attributes cannot be represented by them without a potential significant loss of information astel et al 2007 as an alternative approach to deal with such amount of data there is a growing use of artificial neural networks ann which have been extensively applied in hydrogeology e g choi et al 2014 agoubi 2018 wagh et al 2018 ann are computational models aiming to resemble biological brain behavior through layers of neurons expressed as mathematical functions organized in a network of singular entities haykin 1999 a particular type of ann introduced by kohonen 1982 the self organizing maps som produces a discretized low dimensional usually two dimensional representation of high dimensional input samples the method groups sample vectors into cells using dissimilarity metrics while seeking to maintain the original topological relationship of the input space revealing nonlinear correlations these reduced space representations called component planes can be generated for each attribute making it possible to compare them one by one thus through som it is likely to achieve a better visualization and discretization of large and complex datasets compared to what could be obtained with pca astel et al 2007 as an auxiliary tool to interpret the component planes generated by som the k means clustering has been applied to statistically group similar samples from the obtained outputs e g brentan et al 2018 iwashita et al 2018 the technique allows to mathematically group the samples in an optimal number of clusters which is obtained through a quantitative index because the component planes represent the mean values of the attributes of the set of samples depicted in each cell the k means method efficiently generates clusters from them this way the combined use of som with k means enables an objective discretization and further interpretation of major hydrogeochemical patterns from large multi dimensional aquifer datasets studies that applied som to investigate groundwater properties comprise different spatial scales choi et al 2014 employed the som methodology to discuss the groundwater quality in south korea the authors defined 10 hydrogeochemical parameters from 299 wells spread across all 100 210 km2 of the country s territory to run the algorithm they found representative clusters that reflect the regional controls of groundwater agoubi 2018 performed som with isotopic data from 32 wells from an aquifer in tunisia identifying clusters that denote groundwater mixing processes friedel et al 2020 applied som to predict attributes comparing four learning based methods for groundwater data from new zealand the authors found that a modified som had the best results for prediction in brazil som was used to study groundwater attributes in a central area of the sgas in paran√° state comprising roughly 60 000 km2 friedel and iwashita 2013 analyzed pumping tests terrain morphometry and 10 hydrogeochemical attributes from 333 wells to evaluate spatial continuity of these attributes in the area using semi variograms iwashita et al 2018 used som to characterize the area s hydrogeology applying morphometric gis geophysical well information attributes and 14 hydrogeochemical attributes from 1 132 wells to process the som analysis the authors examined the mixing between the sgas and underlying aquifers the results allowed the identification of seven clusters interpreted to be related to meteoric recharge to typical signatures of the sgas to longer residence times within the sgas and to inputs from underlying aquifers to apply som the input data can be obtained from field and or laboratory analysis which leads to higher costs and demands more time alternatively it can be obtained from previously available databases i e secondary datasets information on geochemical attributes of groundwater wells located in the sgas is freely available at the brazilian geological survey groundwater database siagas http siagasweb cprm gov br thousands of wells related to the sgas are recorded but the data are largely incomplete and present variable levels of quality being necessary an initial filtering for a som analysis the current study aims to understand the spatial occurrence and controlling factors of the regional scale hydrogeochemistry of the sgas in the southern region of brazil across rio grande do sul state using the previously unexplored large dataset of wells from siagas in this area to conduct the investigation two objectives are defined the first is to find correlations between chemical attributes and identify clusters according to differences in these relationships the second is to analyze the spatial distribution of clusters and interpret the controlling factors for it the methodology involves the use of som combined with the k means method to identify such patterns through the identification of the hydrogeochemical regional spatialization and controls a better understanding of the groundwater cycle for the southern portion of the sgas is achieved which is important for the assessment of regional water quality and water management the obtained results support the scalability of som for larger areas and larger datasets and allow the establishment of a workflow to process large hydrogeochemical databases with som and subsequent k means clustering lastly a conceptual model for the sgas dynamics in the study area is suggested 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the region under study is located in rio grande do sul state southern brazil fig 1 corresponding to an area of 135 950 km2 wildner et al 2008 throughout it the sgas is as an unconfined aquifer covering approximately 50 of the entire state area in a region where 80 of the population relies on groundwater as the main water supply nanni et al 2008 and where these volcanic rocks can reach 1 200 m in thickness machado 2005 the primary mineralogy of the sgas rocks consists of plagioclase pyroxene olivine and magnetite for the basaltic portion and plagioclase pyroxene magnetite alkali feldspar and quartz for the rhyolitic part bellieni et al 1984 the sgas overlies the guarani aquifer system gas a giant sedimentary confined aquifer system mostly sandy and porous with subordinate clayish facies ar√∫jo et al 1999 gilboa et al 1976 machado and freitas 2005 sracek and hirata 2002 the gas occurs along the paran√° etendeka basin and in many areas where the volcanic aquifer is not overlaying it the gas is unconfined see in fig 1 the mean thickness of the gas is 100 m reaching up to 600 m machado 2005 underlying the gas there are aquitards and porous aquifers composed of heterogeneous sedimentary permian units overlying all of them porous cenozoic sediments only a few meters thick occur in restricted areas all of these individual reservoirs have singular geological characteristics each one contributing to the groundwater composition with its own chemical attributes groundwater flow and storage in the sgas occur mainly through structural discontinuities mostly subhorizontal fractures in the contacts of volcanic layers but also through subvertical tectonic fractures fernandes et al 2016 the last ones extend to the deeper formations being responsible for hydraulic connections between sgas gas and permian reservoirs which promote groundwater mixing nanni et al 2008 reginato et al 2013 cunha et al 2016 these conditions could explain the different composition values that would be expected for the ubiquitous meteoric recharge in unconfined aquifers where elevated concentrations of sodium chloride fluoride and sulphate are found nanni et al 2008 according to machado 2005 and nanni et al 2008 regional scale tectonic structures divide the study area into major hydrogeological blocks fig 1 these portions are characterized by heterogeneities in terms of fractures and stratigraphy which impact the dynamics of flow these differences end up introducing distinct hydrogeochemical patterns in the groundwater system from the upper volcanic rocks to the underlying sedimentary formations machado 2005 discuss the dissimilarities between the blocks where the western block is characterized by a dominance of northwest fractures with the thickest layers of the gas reaching more than 600 m where the overlying sgas has a mean thickness of 100 m the eastern blocks have a prevalence of northeast structures with thickness for the sgas ranging from a few meters to more than 700 m with the gas ranging from 100 to 200 m the northern block is structurally dominated by northwest and northeast fractures and has the thickest layer of the sgas ranging from 300 to 1 200 m with the gas occurring with a mean thickness of 100 m the central block does not show a preferential direction of fractures with northwest and northeast structures cutting each other where the thickness can reach up to 500 m in the sgas and 400 m in the gas 2 2 data pre processing the hydrogeochemical dataset was obtained from siagas and processed through a series of filters to remove wells that did not meet specifications to allow the qualification of the data in addition because the database has many wells with incomplete data missing values were replaced through an imputation method first data from all wells in the sgas outcrop area were gathered then data were compiled from proximal limits covering areas where the sedimentary formations not only underlies but also overlaps or juxtaposes the sgas due to erosion or tectonism to recognize typologies of mixture between the aquifers the extraction resulted in 15 081 catalogued wells organized by localization hydrogeology and hydrogeochemistry next the first stage to eliminate unsuited data was applied where the wells containing geological profiles comprised of only sedimentary units and that do not intercept the sgas or that were out of the sgas limits were excluded leaving 12 519 wells many of the attributes for each well were missing and further data refinement was required this was firstly made by the definition of target attributes which would be used as input values for the som analysis as essential attributes to hydrogeochemical studies and major constituents in the sgas groundwaters 16 attributes were chosen ph electrical conductivity ec total hardness total dissolved solids tds calcium chloride total iron potassium magnesium sodium nitrate sulphate fluoride manganese bicarbonate and alkalinity from these attributes values equal to 0 or concentrations bellow 0 01 mg l were considered missing values in the last case to avoid values generated by measures bellow detection limits that are not informed at siagas after the filtering wells with values greater than the sum of the attributes mean with three standard deviations were considered extreme values and removed avoiding biasing the som algorithm resulting in 12 257 wells this treatment of discrepant low and high values sought to reduce uncertainty in the data related to the heterogeneity of input sources of siagas and its inherent vulnerability to human error furthermore such values may represent local anomalies that are not within the regional scope of the present study the next step was the removal of wells with more than 6 missing attributes because this is the number where there is an inflection in the quantity of wells with missing data representing a threshold to representativeness and quality of data as a result the number of wells was reduced to 2848 from these although the number of wells with a complete dataset is very low 1 when considering the number of valid values for all wells a wide percentage of the total set is represented 79 a subsequent imputation of the missing values was performed at spss statistics with the multiple imputation tool as described in ibm 2017 with an iterative markov chain monte carlo method 50 sets of values each set consisting of values for all incomplete attributes were generated using a univariate model adjusted with the others attributes as predictors to select the most representative set of imputed values they were split into subsets by attributes and for each attribute the subset with the lowest absolute value of s was chosen s was defined as the difference between the attribute arithmetic mean of the imputed values and the original values am i o and of the original values only am o added to the difference between the attribute standard deviations of the imputed values and the original values sd i o and of the original values only sd o as shown in 1 1 s n am i o am o sd i o sd o 1 n 50 at the end of wells selection phase and after the imputation procedure charge balance errors cbe were calculated 2 removing wells with absolute value of error greater than 10 as a final outcome 1 564 wells remained shown in fig 1 for an initial number of 15 081 which then were used as inputs for the som algorithm 2 c b e c a t i o n s a n i o n s c a t i o n s a n i o n s 100 i o n s i n meq l 2 3 self organizing maps with the filtered and imputed data the som algorithm was processed at matlab software using the extension som toolbox vesanto et al 2000 the processing starts with the input data a dataset of cases and their attributes in this study the cases were the groundwater wells and the attributes were the 16 hydrogeochemical parameters defined in the pre processing phase following a number of iterative steps the position of each case is adjusted in a dimensionally reduced representation of a grid made up by nodes known as component planes in a manner that approximates cases with similarity in their attributes values in the same nodes or in its neighborhood kohonen 1990 by the tool default the grid size equals the best approximation to a value five times the square root of the number of cases and as discussed by kohonen 2013 it is optimally distributed in a number of rows and columns that correspond to the ratio between the two largest principal components of the data for each attribute one component plane is generated and for the same node position in every component plane the same cases are depicted vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 the position adjustment is made by calculating the value of the best matching unit bmu for each attribute at each step and used to best fit the case in the available nodes vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 after all iterations are concluded the output is an organized low dimensional representation of the dataset a bidimensional image colorized according to the mean value of the input attribute for the cases within each node a component plane a number of component planes equals to the number of input attributes is generated forming a set of component planes reflecting data original distance between the cases and thus illustrating their correlations in a visually interpretable dimension alhoniemi et al 1999 the processing also creates a u matrix unified distance matrix that represents the distance between neighboring nodes for all attributes where greater values reflect greater dissimilarities kohonen 2013 to avoid the greatest influence of attributes with wider intervals of values in the processing vesanto et al 2000 the values were standardized for each attribute its mean value was subtracted from its original values and divided by its standard deviation this process was also made with the som toolbox extension 2 4 k means clustering for clustering the k means method was assigned and processed with tools available at som toolbox vesanto et al 2000 the technique is an iterative clustering algorithm firstly proposed by macqueen 1967 that aims to partition data space into k clusters where each case is attributed to the group with the closest mean this results in a segmentation of the cases according to the distances between the values of their attributes the method divides a dataset in a predetermined number of clusters according to their centers that are randomly initialized minimizing the squared error function between the center of a cluster and its cases jain 2010 in the present study the cases were represented by vectors from the som results providing cleaner data than the original leading to a simpler clustering process with fewer clusters as result vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 although the number of clusters should be predefined the tool with its stochastic nature which runs several times for each number selecting the one that minimizes the error function due to its random initialization enables the processing of multiple numbers of clusters at each execution thus the optimal number of clusters is evaluated by the calculation of the davies bouldin index dbi for each quantity also performed by the som toolbox dbi quantifies the average similarity between the most similar clusters with lower values meaning greater dissimilarity davies and bouldin 1979 thereby the minimum value represents the best suited number of clusters to divide the data to evaluate the generalizability of clusters obtained through the k means method holdout cross validation on random stratified data splitting was performed the dataset of 1564 wells was split into two subsets 80 20 with each part randomly representing the clusters in the same percentage as in the results from som for the full dataset the 80 part was used to train and generate som with the same attributes as the one for the full dataset the 20 part was used just as testing which was classified in som trained by the 80 part the som results were then clustered by the k means method with the predefined number of four clusters to compare the assignment of clusters of the individual parts with those from the full dataset this procedure was repeated 10 times where a new split was determined in each run the results of this evaluation are matrices that show the number of wells by cluster between the processing of som for the whole dataset and for each part of 80 and 20 additionally the f1 score was calculated for each cluster 3 to evaluate the overall classification considering the sum of the results of multiple runs its values range from 0 to 1 where higher values show a better performance in classification tharwat 2018 3 f 1 s c o r e 2 t p 2 t p f p f n where the variables compare the k means assignment of the whole dataset hypothetically considered as the correct classification with the ones for each part of the dataset in relation to a specific cluster tp true positives is the number of wells from the split dataset with correct classification fp false positives is the number of wells from the split dataset that is wrongly classified and fn false negatives is the number of wells from the split dataset that is incorrectly not assigned to the specified cluster 3 results and discussion 3 1 self organizing maps after testing a series of training steps for the som analysis using a 11 18 grid a stable repetitive result was achieved with the training parameters shown in table 1 generating the maps shown in fig 2 a most nodes have low values for all hydrogeochemical attributes which is illustrated by bluish shades denoting that lower values are the usual for the dataset this is a reflex of meteoric water with low ionic content which is responsible for the largest volume of recharge for the sgas higher values that are illustrated by reddish shades on the other hand occur as isolated portions and because of this are better to correlate the attributes the correlation is made comparing each node located at the same position in all the component planes if the colors match the attributes are positively correlated in the wells represented by the node an inevitable positive correlation between ec and tds is observed as well as for bicarbonate and alkalinity and these two pairs are also related to each other these attributes together mark for the study area conditions evolved waters with longer residence times gastmans et al 2017 they are linked to prolonged water rock interactions that lead to weathering processes in the mineralogy of rocks generating the observed enrichment in these attributes the elevated number of occurrences with higher levels of all these four attributes in two isolated areas in the component planes can indicate two different origins for their inputs one could be related to the weathering of the sgas rocks and the other one to the recharge from the underlying sedimentary formations as further discussed in the following paragraphs exploring the other attributes a positive correlation between chloride fluoride sulphate and sodium is marked with varying degrees of correspondence these elements except sodium are not widely available at sgas mineralogy thus their combination is an indicator of the influence of ascending waters from the sedimentary layers underlying the sgas nanni et al 2009 related to varying piezometric levels of these confined formations that can reach the sgas under favorable structural and topographical conditions machado et al 2002 machado 2005 also marking longer residence times furthermore ec tds bicarbonate and alkalinity are partially correlated with them also pointing to an input from the sedimentary reservoirs calcium magnesium and total hardness are positively correlated since these attributes are not correlated with chloride sodium sulphate and fluoride they should not have the same origin therefore these attributes are probably related to the weathering of the existing minerals in the sgas the primary mineralogy of sgas rocks is composed of these elements pyroxene olivine and plagioclase and thus can be responsible for the presence of these ions gastmans et al 2016 secondary minerals such as calcite occur in the sgas discontinuities murata et al 1987 at the same place where groundwater may flow suggesting another possibility of provenance these reactions also reflect longer residence time gastmans et al 2017 som component planes show that nitrate potassium total iron and manganese are uncorrelated with any other attribute indicating specific controls in their distribution these attributes may be related to urban and agricultural sources palmucci et al 2016 khan et al 2018 and their dissimilar patterns could be related to the heterogeneous distribution of these sources also iron and manganese are related to the weathering of sgas rocks in its weathering mantle facetti masulli et al 2003 indicating a geogenic source regardless of their origin their isolated patterns in the component planes are in accordance with the wide variability of surface situations anthropogenic or natural corroborating the idea of shallow controls at a smaller scale a portion of potassium and total iron is correlated with chloride fluoride sulphate and sodium indicating a possible contribution of the underlying sedimentary sequences for their provenance griffioen 2001 suggests that potassium contribution is related to the occurrence of glauconite an easily dissoluble potassium mineral in marine sedimentary layers this mineral is reported by ng et al 2019 in the underlying permian units the iron input is favored by reducing conditions at higher depths in sedimentary aquifers associated to longer residence times palmucci et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 a high variability was observed for ph which presented only partial correlations with some attributes as ec tds chloride sodium sulphate fluoride bicarbonate and alkalinity this indicates a relationship with the sedimentary units which seems to favor an increase in ph levels as discussed by hirata et al 2011 to explain higher ph values in an occurrence of the gas this association could represent the dissolution of calcite driven by cation exchange at deeper zones of the sedimentary layers where the carbonate is present as interstitial cement 3 2 k means clustering four clusters were identified by the k means method fig 2b as this was the most frequent number with the lowest dbi after calculating the index 50 times with each calculation depicting the best results based on the sum of squared errors for 50 individual runs of the algorithm fig 3 although the clustering technique allowed a mathematical separation observing the u matrix fig 2a the distinction of groups is not visually clear evidencing a smooth transition of the attributes in clusters 1 2 and 3 and on the other hand that cluster 4 has a great variation in its attributes this behavior is not observed in the individual component planes where differences are visible which were recognized through the k means analysis demonstrating the importance of the method for objective data grouping the clustered wells were plotted in georeferenced maps for the analysis of their spatial distributions fig 4 boxplots for all attributes separated by clusters were generated to assist the interpretations fig 5 the evaluation of the identified clusters done by the results from random stratified data sampling table 2 shows that clusters 1 2 and 4 maintained their differentiation between each other with f1 scores for the 80 part of 0 82 0 88 and 0 74 respectively and for the 20 part of 0 81 0 87 and 0 70 in the same previous order on the other hand cluster 3 presented higher levels of error with f1 score of 0 44 for the 80 part and of 0 41 for the 20 part indicating some degree of overlapping of characteristics of this group with the other three at this stage the depth of the wells table 3 is an interesting attribute to correlate with the clusters although not used in the som analysis to maintain geochemical attributes as the only type of input data the depth was kept in the dataset the existence of hydraulic connections between the aquifers in the study area with the deeper wells at the sgas being closer to the underlying sedimentary formations as a general tendency indicates that it is interesting to correlate this attribute with the obtained clusters to investigate the existence of patterns cluster 1 988 wells presents many of the lowest hydrogeochemical attributes values and the largest spatial range occurring in all hydrogeological blocks its composition is consistent with waters from meteoric recharge with short residence times as reinforced by its lowest mean depth exceptions for the low values are elevated levels of total iron potassium nitrate and manganese as previously discussed surface controls could cause punctual higher concentrations of these elements shown by the outlying values in the boxplots supporting the influence of shallow processes in this group cluster 2 341 wells is distinguished by higher values of total hardness calcium magnesium bicarbonate and alkalinity although this cluster is widely distributed it represents the dominant cluster in the southeastern block which is closer to the sgas escarpment where regional groundwater flows converge machado and freitas 2005 characterizing a discharge area these conditions seem to allow prolonged water rock reactions and weathering of the reservoir mineralogy causing an enrichment of these chemical attributes this cluster has a relatively large transition zone from cluster 1 cyan green color in the component planes that together with its composition qualifies this group as a progressive temporal evolution from meteoric waters this idea is supported when comparing the mean depth of both clusters evidencing higher depths for cluster 2 it also shares higher nitrate concentrations with cluster 1 reinforcing their connection possibly as a reflex of the ion persistence in shallow conditions mastrocicco et al 2011 cluster 3 175 wells exhibits attributes with varying intermediate levels from the other groups denoting a composition influenced by mixtures between different reservoirs possibly of contrasting residence times this mixing relationship is also marked by the evaluation of cluster generalizability where this cluster is related to the greatest divergences in the classification results although it is widely distributed except in the western block it is more concentrated at the extreme north of the northern block this region represents an area of ascending recharge from the sedimentary units as demonstrated by the occurrence of thermal waters freitas et al 2016 leading to the mixing of waters its depths are transitional between the shallowest clusters 1 and 2 and the deepest cluster 4 sustaining the hypothesis of a mixed chemistry cluster 4 60 wells has the highest values for attributes as ec tds chloride sodium sulphate and fluoride it also has cases with higher values of ph total hardness calcium bicarbonate and alkalinity all these levels are indicators of an origin from the underlying sedimentary formations corroborated by their higher depths reaching up to 900 m these conditions are related to higher residence times as also shown by the isotopic analyses described by nanni et al 2013 this cluster occurs mainly in three areas the extreme north of the northern block the southeastern blocks and the western block which denotes a relatively low frequency compared with the other clusters probably due to the scarcity of deeper wells the hydrogeochemical properties of each cluster which reflect spatial distribution and geochemical controls allow schematizing a simplified model for the sags regional groundwater cycle shown in fig 6 as a general trend starting from meteoric waters that represent the main recharge for the system the composition may be altered by some punctual shallow processes characterizing cluster 1 with longer water rock interaction and higher depths these waters may evolve with the weathering of sgas lithologies marking cluster 2 or mixing with ionic rich flows from the underlying sedimentary units at variable degrees which distinguishes cluster 3 in particular areas preferentially at the highest depths the water may be widely dominated by inputs from the sedimentary layers typifying cluster 4 the proposed hydrogeochemical interpretation is coherent with the discussion made by iwashita et al 2018 in another area of the sgas whereas the spatial pattern is problematic to correlate due to contrasts in the regional geology the recognized controls are similar despite that the cited study identified a greater number of clusters which is explained by the greater data variability of the more heterogeneous type of attributes that were analyzed likewise the results of the current study are hydrogeochemically congruent to those presented by nanni et al 2009 in a correspondent area of the sgas in which the authors applied pca to a smaller number of wells and attributes also identifying a greater number of clusters in this case the increasing could reflect either the inability of pca to consider nonlinear relationships implying in a greater dissimilarity between the samples or that the regional trend was not highlighted with the reduced amount of data 4 conclusions a methodology combining som and k means clustering is reaffirmed to be an efficient tool to study extensive geochemical datasets from aquifers in large areas allowing the elaboration of simplified models from high dimensional data applying these techniques to a freely available database made possible to explore regional hydrogeochemical relationships for the sgas a consistent training dataset and som model was obtained due to the proposed workflow to filter hydrogeochemical data where a series of steps were applied to minimize the noise and to deal with the incompleteness of the dataset evaluation of the results through dataset splitting and random stratified resampling showed that som and k means produced consistent and robust classification variations in the groundwater chemistry induced the identification of four clusters of wells which explain the sgas dynamics in a simplified way cluster 1 dominated by meteoric waters with some impacts from surface processes cluster 2 evolved from meteoric waters with ion enrichment from the chemical weathering of sgas minerals cluster 3 represented by the mixing of meteoric waters evolved or not and ascending waters from deeper sedimentary layers and cluster 4 characterized by waters with higher ionic contents related to the underlying sedimentary units with low influence of meteoric input the spatial distribution of clusters ranges between the most widely distributed cluster 1 and the most restricted cluster 4 with clusters 2 and 3 at intermediate positions showing specific areas of high densities the heterogeneities in the composition and occurrence of clusters seems to be mainly controlled by the tectonic and stratigraphic framework which are related to the spatial distribution and depth of wells this work observed characteristics related to a regional view of the hydrogeochemical facies of the sgas whereas at a larger scale given the continental dimensions of this aquifer the driving factors can vary locally and regionally leading to a much more complex system while the discussed interpretations may not consider more particular aspects of the hydrogeological process in the sgas we expect that as databases continue to expand with new hydrogeochemical data and new collected variables lidar geophysical radar etc these shortcomings will be resolved allowing to achieve a more detailed model of the sgas through methods suited to cope with big data such as unsupervised machine learning techniques credit authorship contribution statement matheus rossi santos writing original draft

5127,biofilm growth can impact seepage flow properties in the porous media thereby affecting the performance of the infiltration systems to better understand and characterize the biofilm distribution and its effect on seepage flow fields in the porous media with different morphologies two dimensional transparent flow cells were developed using x ray images of zeolite gravel and ceramsite columns to study the effect of biofilm development and the pore structure on seepage flow properties the results revealed that the filter morphology and biofilm growth significantly impacted the seepage flow field in porous media with biofilm growth a preferential flow pathway was more likely to be formed in angular filter cells zeolite shaped cells than spherical filter cells ceramsite shaped cells it was also found that microbial growth rate was closely related to seepage flowrate in 2d porous media cells the biofilm grew faster in the areas with higher seepage flowrate the biofilm accumulation did not seem to affect the location of the preferential seepage flow probably due to the high permeability of the biofilm in the large pore throats although the water head loss of ceramsite shaped cells was larger than that of two others due to its relatively smaller size of pore throat the ceramsite shaped cells presented small dead zone and short circuiting which means that ceramiste filter media had higher hydraulic efficiency keywords biofilm filter morphology porous medium seepage flow properties 1 introduction infiltration systems such as constructed wetlands are commonly used for the treatment of wastewater or stormwater discharges in infiltration systems the quality of infiltrated water improves progressively during its infiltration flow path through porous media as a consequence of physical chemical and biological processes perujo et al 2019 the performance of infiltration systems mainly relies on biofilm development within the porous media biofilms drive crucial ecosystem processes battin et al 2016 particularly porous medium provides an appropriate environment for bacterial attachment and biofilm development due to its inherently high surface to volume ratios valiei et al 2012 biofilm microorganisms are encased in a matrix of multi component hydrated biopolymers called extracellular polymeric substances eps and present increased resistance against external stresses flemming and wingender 2010 an excessive build up of microbial biomass cells and eps can cause fouling of the porous media known as bioclogging baveye et al 1998 hand et al 2008 brovelli et al 2009 carrel et al 2018a perujo et al 2019 bioclogging can affect the seepage flow by forming short circuiting and dead zones in porous media which can result in poor pollution removal zhu et al 2020 therefore it is of great significance to study how biofilm development affects the seepage flow in porous media given the importance of biofilm growth in porous media a considerable amount of research has been conducted in this area a number of the studies used columns or column like setups with filter media to study the influencing factors and process of bioclogging as well as the impact of bioclogging on hydraulic characteristics and transport properties engesgaard et al 2006 seifert and engesgaard 2007 hand et al 2008 mostafa and van geel 2015 zhou et al 2018 hua et al 2019 however current column studies on bioclogging are subject to several limitations thullner 2010 such as wall effect for very small columns tallarek et al 2001 and water flowing only along the length of the column in one dimensional systems in addition it is usually difficult to visualize the biofilm growth in porous media and its effect on the dynamic change of the seepage flow field due to its opacity thus two dimensional 2d experimental micro models have been developed to directly observe the biological growth in pores over time and space 2d micromodels are a common option for visualizing pore scale processes in the multi phase flow keller et al 1997 a 2d silicon pore imaging element consisting of a random width rectangular grid was introduced by dupin and mccarty 1999 dupin and mccarty 2000 they reported that the decrease in hydraulic conductivity was correlated with biological growth and its morphology and the sudden conductivity recoveries were correlated with sloughing events the morphology of biofilms in the porous media was also observed by valiei et al 2012 and hassanpourfard et al 2016 in their 2d microfluidic experimental setups they noticed that filamentous structures known as streamer were formed under the effect of fluid flow and then led to the clogging in a microfluidic device drescher et al 2013 also found biofilm streamers caused sudden and rapid clogging using a series of experiments in a microfluidic model coyte et al 2017 used a microfluidic device to simulate soil like porous environments they investigated the flow and biofilm interaction and revealed that hydrodynamics can profoundly affect the bacteria competition and evolvement in porous environments however these studies were performed using a mono species biofilm in regular rectangle or circle and uniform pore structure one of the critical factors pore morphology which controls biofilm formation and thus the development of the seepage flow field in porous media is still not well understood recently three dimensional experimental micro models have been developed to investigate and directly visualize biofilm growth and its effect on flow dynamics peszynska et al 2016 carrel et al 2018b these studies were carried out in the porous media constituted in most cases by homogeneous materials such as glass beads and homogeneous sands rubol et al 2018 explored the seepage flow in the porous media formed by irregularly shaped grains using particle image velocimetry piv and refractive index matching rim techniques however there are constraints in experimental sizes due to the limit of imaging techniques making it hard to monitor biofilm structures noninvasively at the macroscale carrel et al 2018b infiltration systems are usually filled with zeolite gravel and ceramsite and thus have heterogeneous porous morphology which affects bacterial growth harvey et al 1993 heterogeneities of both porous media and biofilm structures should be considered simultaneously kim et al 2010 however little is known about the interactions between seepage flow field and natural biofilm development the objective of this study is to acquire an in depth understanding of biofilm development and its interaction with fluid flow properties in porous media of different morphology to improve our understanding of bioclogging process in the heterogeneous pore structure the effect of the filter morphology on the change in hydraulic conductivity was investigated in column experiments based on this 2d porous media flow cells pmfcs produced according to x ray computed tomography x ct images of the columns filled with zeolite gravel and ceramsite were used to observe the interaction between the seepage flow change and biofilm growth in different pore structures the seepage flow characteristic and hydraulic efficiency with biofilm development in pmfcs with different filter morphologies was also investigated 2 methods and materials 2 1 experimental setup three identical saturated cylindrical poly methyl methacrylate columns 15 cm in diameter and 70 cm high were constructed as shown in fig 1 two piezometer tubes were used to measure the water head at the filter media surface and the outlet to determine the water head loss through the filter media a perforated plate with holes 1 mm in diameter was placed at the bottom of the filter media which prevented particles movement and provided a uniform outflow a peristaltic pump provided a constant flow rate to the column from an upstream tank the artificial wastewater which was prepared according to zhong and wu 2013 table s1 was used in the experiment zeolite gravel and ceramsite particles were used as filter media in the experiment these are commonly used in infiltration systems and represent different morphologies with angular less angular and spherical shapes the grain size of the substrates was 8 10 mm the 2d porous pmfc system was set up for monitoring the biofilm morphology and hydraulic characteristics in porous media a schematic of the 2d pmfc system used in this study is shown in fig 2 the experimental system was consisted of three parts 1 a peristaltic pump with a pressure regulator to supply artificial wastewater at a constant flow rate 2 2d pmfcs containing different pore structures formed by commonly used filter media with different shapes zeolite wang et al 2020 gravel sapdhare et al 2019 and ceramsite shao et al 2019 and 3 effluent ports the porous media zone of the 2d pmfcs was 85 cm high 60 cm wide and 0 5 cm thick the 2d pmfc media were produced according to x ct images of filter media fig s1 through laser engraving technology and were arranged between two ultra clear glass corresponding to the x ct images therefore the pore channels and pore nodes of the pmfcs were consistent with the real 2d pore structures of the filter medium three pmfcs were produced corresponding to the porous media zeolite gravel and ceramsite and named cell 1 cell 2 and cell 3 respectively the porosities of cell 1 cell 2 and cell 3 were 0 71 0 66 and 0 59 respectively the pmfcs allowed clear visualization of the flow field and biofilm growth in a porous medium 2 2 experimental procedure the columns were operated identically with vertical down flow for about three months artificial wastewater was fed into the top of each column and discharged from the bottom through a perforated pipe the columns were saturated by controlling the flow rate they were operated continuously at a relatively high hydraulic loading of 0 41 m d each pmfc was mounted in a machined holder to which the tubes were connected at first inoculation was achieved by injecting the pre culture bacterial solution firstly at a constant flow rate of 5 ml min into the cells after inoculation the artificial wastewater was fed into the pmfcs from the top at room temperature 20 25 c in dark the height adjustable outlet was used to ensure the constant flowrate in the cells the average flow velocity in the all cells was 0 20 0 21 mm s and the reynold numbers were 1 7 1 8 and 2 1 respectively in cells 1 2 and 3 three parallel experiments were conducted to analyze the effect of pore structure on seepage flow field 2 3 measurements and methods the hydraulic conductivity k m d for the columns was obtained weekly by measuring the water level difference between the two pitot tubes and using darcy s law eq 1 1 k q l Œ¥ h a where q m3 d is the flow rate Œ¥h m is the water level difference between the two pitot tubes water head l m is the path length through the substrate and a m2 is the surface area of the column dye tracer was used to visualize the change in flow patterns in porous media affected by biofilm growth dye tracer tests were performed every 3 days by injecting red dye at the inlet of the pmfc the red tracer was prepared by mixing red ink and small amount of xanthan gum and ethanol to lower its diffusivity in water the dye tracer had a density close to water and was harmless to the biofilm images of dye propagation in the reactor were processed using matlab sequential pictures were imported as rgb matrices for each pixel the color change ratio was compared to the background color thereby the flow path and dead zones were analyzed by accumulating dye saturation fraction in porous space grayscale images of the biofilm and porous media were taken every 24 h these images were then converted to binary images based on the optimal threshold computed by the image thresholding algorithm yang et al 2001 and were used to quantify the biofilm quantity according to the areal parameters of the biofilm proportions kim et al 2010 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analysis was conducted using spss version 22 analysis of variance was performed to assess the significant differences in seepage flow and biofilm growth redundancy analysis rda was used to determine associations between morphological factors of filter media pore structure properties and seepage flow field characteristics 3 results 3 1 characteristics of filter media and pore structure x ct technique was used to investigate the morphology of the filter medium and the pore structure after 2d images of the three filter media were obtained fig s1 data processing and analysis were performed on the statistical results for the morphologies of the filter media and pore structures to characterize the particle shapes different shape factors were calculated according to the definition of blott and pye 2008 l and s the longest and shortest edge dimensions of the minimum bounding box enclosing the particles were used as shape descriptors fig s2 moreover the term angularity ap is used to indicate the degree of angularity of the particles kuo and freeman 2000 which can be calculated as 2 ap p convex p ellipse 2 where p convex is the convex perimeter p ellipse is the perimeter of an equivalent ellipse which is a fictitious ellipse that has the same area and aspect ratio as the aggregate particle the roundness l s and ap were also used to describe the particle shape the morphology of the filter media is shown in table 1 as shown in table 1 the l s roundness and ap of the ceramsite particles is smallest followed by the gravel and zeolite particles the ceramsite particles had the lowest degree of angularity and were closest to round while the zeolite particles had the highest degree of angularity and lowest degree of roundness based on x ct images of the filter media the topological structure of the pore space was extracted the pore space in the substrate can be simplified as relatively large pore chambers connected by relatively small pore throats zhang et al 2018 fig s3 the flux of water through porous media is proportional to the pore throat diameter ewing and gupta 1994 the pore throat structure of the three 2d filter media was quantitatively evaluated and the results are shown in fig 3 and table 2 as shown in table 2 the average pore radius of the zeolite medium was 8 35 mm while those of gravel and ceramsite were 7 35 and 6 13 mm respectively similarly the pore throats of the filter ceramsite medium were smaller than those of zeolite and gravel indicating that the pore throats formed by the regular spherical particles were much smaller than those formed by irregular angular particles fig 3 also shows pore throats larger than 2 5 mm distributed in the zeolite and gravel shaped cells which could affect the flow distribution in the porous media vogel and roth 2001 moreover the pore structure of the most angular filter particles zeolite was observed to be the most disordered followed by the gravel and ceramsite shaped filter media 3 2 changes in hydraulic conductivity in column experiment fig 4 shows the change in the hydraulic conductivity of the three columns with different filter media the initial hydraulic conductivity of ceramsite was 3900 m d which was much higher than those of zeolite 2400 m d and gravel 2600 m d which is consistent with previous research by sperry and peirce 1995 the shape of individual particles affected the hydraulic conductivity and head loss and porous media comprising irregular particles exhibited a lower hydraulic conductivity during operation the biofilm growth in the porous media resulted from pollution degradation filled the pore space changed hydrologic properties and decreased the hydraulic conductivity during the first 40 days the hydraulic conductivity of zeolite and gravel columns decreased significantly to 310 and 89 m d due to the build up of microbial biomass in the porous medium while the hydraulic conductivity of the ceramsite column only decreased to 1050 m d moreover the rate of decrease of the hydraulic conductivity in the ceramsite column ranged from 1 4 to 7 2 per day during the first 40 days which was much smaller than those of the zeolite and gravel columns during the second set of experiments the rate of decrease of the hydraulic conductivity in the ceramsite column was larger than that of the other two columns and the hydraulic conductivity decreased from 1050 to 19 m d which was smaller than 105 m d for the zeolite column and 26 m d for the gravel column at the end of the experiment 3 3 biofilm growth and distribution in different cells the pmfcs were firstly inoculated with the artificial wastewater by injecting at a constant flow rate of 5 ml min into the cells natural habitat microbes attachment and natural biofilm formation occurred on the surfaces of the 2d media meanwhile some filamentous structures consisting of a few bacteria were also observed on the surfaces of some 2d media fig s5 within 6 8 days after inoculation uniform biofilms of detectable thickness could be observed on the surface of the media with time the biofilms grew thicker and began to clog the pore throats the biofilms were denser close to the substrate surfaces and sparser away from them according to the grayscale images fig s5 the biofilm distribution in the pmfcs with time is shown in fig 5 no obvious difference in biofilm thickness was detected between the upstream and downstream ends of the cells during the first 6 days of incubation with time the biofilm growth became more randomly distributed and the biofilm distribution along the cells was inhomogeneous some places showed dense biofilm distributions while others showed almost no biofilm fig 5 overall biofilm accumulation preferentially occurred closer to the inlet this was in qualitative agreement with the experimental observation of biofilm growth in a number of systems simoni et al 2001 the change in biofilm quantity with time is shown in fig 6 during the first 3 days the biofilm grew slowly after that the growth rate increased significantly and at the 11th day the biofilm proportion reached 50 60 biofilm accumulation continued until the growth rate was balanced by the detachment rate and then the biofilm growth reached the stationary phase before decreasing slowly at the end of the experiment this process was consistent with the microbial growth phases lag exponential and stationary moreover it is noteworthy that the biofilm proportion of the ceramsite shaped cell was higher than that of the other two cells due to its low porosity which indicated that there was a high risk of bioclogging in the ceramsite shaped cell 3 4 seepage flow field in the 2d cells to investigate how biofilm growth influences the seepage flow through a porous environment the flow distribution in 2d cells was observed through dye tracer tests the flow fields at the first and 15th days are shown in fig 7 before bioclogging the magnitude of this flow diversion depended on the specific geometry of the pore space the seepage flow field was fairly homogeneous in the ceramsite shaped cell while the flow field within each cross section of zeolite shaped and gravel shaped cells was non uniform this non uniformity reflected that fluid moved through preferred pathways in a porous medium thereby bypassing large portions of the porous system which was known as preferential flow lin 2010 fig 7 shows that the principal flow in the cells was not all along well connected highly porous pathways and the formation of preferential channels probably resulted from the inflow configuration and the predominant viscous forces in the momentum transport through the complex void geometry andrade et al 1999 after 15 days the seepage flow field was observed to be less spatially uniform in the cross sections of the cells shown in fig 7 d f and fig s6 the flow was already concentrated in a single channel in the zeolite and gravel shaped flow cells fig 7 g and h resulting in more principal flow pathways through the media this indicated that the growing biofilm affected the pore structure and led to the formation of preferential seepage flow paths and slow velocity zones which was consistent with the results of rubol et al 2014 that microbial process in the heterogeneous medium enhanced the spatially heterogeneous distribution of infiltration rates with time similarly the seepage flow field in the ceramsite shaped cell also became less uniform but the smallest change was observed in both the high and low flow zones fig 7 i moreover the seepage flow field in the ceramsite shaped cell appeared more uniform than that in the two others the area of dye coverage derived from the vertical profiles illustrated the preferential seepage flow pathways which was active for nutrient transport the preferential flow pathway in the cells after one hydraulic retention time hrt is shown in figs 8 and s7 initially the flow pathways in the upper parts of the cells appeared rather uniformly distributed and preferential flow occurred and contributed to the drainage in the lower parts a similar phenomenon was observed where the profile of water infiltration in soil could be divided into a distribution layer near the surface that typically appeared saturated and below a conveyance zone where preferential flow paths formed kim et al 2005 moreover the cells presented distinctive flow field distributions with different pore structures the more uniform flow field was observed in the porous media with larger roundness filter media which indicated that pore structure complexity determined quantitatively different generic transport behavior bijeljic et al 2013 as the biofilm grew preferential seepage flow pathways developed more obviously biomass grew and formed large clusters that occluded pores forcing the flow through preferential pathways resulting in the formation of persistent preferential flow paths bottero et al 2013 some small preferential flow pathways were even blocked and disappeared with further biofilm accumulation especially in cell 1 zeolite shaped cell the pathways decreased abruptly to about 40 and remained constant at about 20 from a depth of 0 to 30 cm fig s9 and significant flow occurred through the preferential flow paths however it was still found that the flow in cell 3 was more uniform than in cells 1 and 2 therefore the preferential seepage flow pathways were strengthened by the microbial activity and the effect of biofilm growth on the flow field depended on the pore structure however the microbial activity also responded to the environmental conditions established by preferential flow such that the physical and biological processes strengthened each other and perpetuated the preferential flow in the cells which disagreed with previous studies where the flow channels changed in size and location sharp et al 2005 bottero et al 2013 probably due to differences in the flow rates of the feed water 3 5 hydraulic efficiency in the cells hydraulic efficiency is an important parameter for pollutant removal efficiency assessment mayo and mutamba 2004 garcia et al 2005 liu et al 2010 poor seepage flow distribution and dead zones can lead to unsatisfactory hydraulic performance and reduce treatment efficiency wang et al 2014 by observing the distribution of tracer solution in the pmfcs during injection the hydraulic performance of the cells with different filter morphology can be assessed the areas free of dye after continuous injection for 1 hrt represented fields of low flow velocity or no flow which are traditionally called dead zones distributions of dead zones obtained using dye tracer were analyzed and are illustrated in fig 9 the pore structure and bioclogging significantly impacted the flow path forming various dead zones after 15 days of incubation the bioclogged cells showed a whole piece shaped distribution of dead zones in the bottom left and the proportion of dead zones reached 54 7 in cell 1 in cell 2 dead zones formed mainly to the left while cell 3 had dead zones distributed in patches moreover the areas of no seepage flow and slow seepage flow in cells 2 and 3 became smaller as shown in fig 9 b and c indicating that filter medium heterogeneity may promote the development of preferential paths and dead zones instead the areas where water was rapidly exchanged by tracer can be considered short circuiting zones the short circuiting zones in cell 1 were found to be larger than that in the other two due to preferential flow this indicated that zeolite shaped filter media can lead to a greater short circuiting effect whereas cell 3 showed the lowest proportion of short circuiting zones indicating that the ceramsite shaped cell yielded higher hydraulic efficiency 4 discussion 4 1 interaction of biofilm growth and seepage flow field the interaction of seepage hydraulic characteristics and biofilm growth in filter media with tortuous geometries is of great interest because of its prevalence in many natural and engineered systems drescher et al 2013 in comparing the results shown in fig 5 and fig 7 it is noteworthy that the zones of large seepage flow velocity coincided with those of the biofilm distribution these results illustrated that bacterial growth and accumulation significantly impacted on the seepage flow field in the porous media which was consistent with the results of yarwood et al 2006 the biofilm growth rate in the 3rd to 10th day and the hydrodynamic characteristics in the different pores of the cells were analyzed relations between biofilm growth and the reynolds number are shown in fig 10 it was shown that the biofilm growth in the cell 1 r 0 814 p 0 01 cell2 r 0 728 p 0 01 and cell 3 r 0 536 p 0 01 were positively correlated with the seepage flowrate which was consistent with the finding of ostvar et al 2018 that biofilm growth was improved at the intermediate and highest flow rates the results were probably due to the competing mass transfer nutrient delivery as morales et al 2010 also reported that highly active microbial zones were predominantly affected by the increased oxygen and nutrient availability in the preferential flow paths besides the biofilm growth was negatively weakly correlated with depth in the cell 1 r 0 111 p 0 05 cell 2 r 0 372 p 0 05 and cell 3 r 0 413 p 0 05 the main reason probably is the low dissolved oxygen delivery in the deep layer compared to nutrient rich inflow given the biofilm growth is sensitive to the availability of oxygen chang et al 2015 the inhomogeneity in the spatial distribution of biofilms appears to be linked to the distribution of the seepage flow rate with the formation of the preferential flow pathways the biofilm was found to accumulate mainly in the zones with relatively high flow conditions whereas in the regions isolated from the flow the biofilm almost stopped growing due to limited nutrient and oxygen supplies fig 5 moreover the preferential flow pathway was found to not change basically its location even though a biofilm patch proliferated in the pathway which was different from previous studies that flow channels were dynamic changing in size number and location after bioclogging sharp et al 2005 coyte et al 2015 this was probably because the biofilm was sparsely affected by shear stresses at the high flow rate and thus the permeability of the biomass significantly affected the seepage flow properties throughout the porous medium pintelon et al 2012 similar results were reported by deng et al 2013 where main flow channeling was still present and mainly followed the same channel when the permeability of biofilm was increased to 1 10 12 m2 in the preferential channel the biomass continued to grow once this was balanced by detachment a stable flow channel was formed bottero et al 2013 4 2 effect of filter media morphology on seepage flow field given that the pollution load can move preferentially into the environment through preferential flow in the infiltration facilities the research on the seepage flow characteristic has increased in importance the vast majority of preferential flow is heterogeneity related lin 2010 however a key problem facing seepage in the porous media at present is the current knowledge of water flow in porous media does not fully reflect the processes at the pore scale therefore it is important to investigate the seepage flow characteristic in porous media with different morphology the 2d pmfc experiments showed that flow and transport within porous media are governed by their porous structure porous structure is indicated by the factors of ap roundness pt10 pt80 pt20 pt90 ptx is the pore throat size corresponding to x greater in the all pore throats while the seepage flow characteristics are indicated by the factors of dz the percent of dead zone area at the end of the experiment and v 1 0 the percent of the area with flow velocity greater than 1 0 mm s at the end of the experiment relations between porous media properties and the seepage flow field characteristics are shown in the redundancy analysis rda plot in fig 11 the axes 1 and 2 explained 90 9 of the total variability in porous structure and flow field characteristics the data showed that pt90 r 0 748 p 0 05 r 0 832 p 0 05 and pt10 r 0 988 p 0 05 r 0 998 p 0 05 were positively correlated with the morphology factors of the filter media ap and roundness which indicated that the size of the largest and smallest part of pore throat in the cells all decreased with the ap and roundness of the filter media pearson correlation analysis also revealed a positive correlation between v 1 0 r 0 712 p 0 05 and pt10 the data revealed that high speed flow area increased with the increase of pt10 which indicated the existence of larger pore throats appeared to play a central role in the formation of preferential flow in the porous media during the biofilm development the biofilm development in the porous media retarded flow and moved the fluid flow to larger throats significantly decreasing the quantitative efficiency of the system langergraber et al 2003 under low reynolds conditions the viscous effects were dominant andrade et al 1999 so that the upper boundaries strongly affected the flow distribution therefore preferential channels formed and became increasingly obvious because the increasingly inhomogeneous flow distribution formed due to the existence of larger pore throat fig 8 the particles with higher roundness and ap will form a larger proportion of large throats in the filter media therefore angular and irregular filters particles tend to form preferential seepage flow pathways with biofilm growth besides it was found that dz of the porous media was correlated with the pt10 r 0 672 p 0 05 the data indicated that the decrease of larger throat size also helped to reduce the proportion of the dead zone meanwhile it is worth noting that dz was also positively correlated with pt90 r 0 774 p 0 05 which implied that small throat in the porous media also can decrease the dead zone the main reason probably is that the proper distribution of small throats may help to interrupt the preferential flow path under the premise that the size of the larger throat is also relatively small thereby helping to increase the uniformity of the seepage flow field 4 3 effect of bioclogging and filter morphology on hydraulic efficiency due to the formation of a preferential seepage flow pathway the dead zones were enlarged with biofilm growth in the zeolite and gravel shaped cells and a considerable proportion of the dead zone was distributed in the two cells which was closely related to treatment efficiency wang et al 2014 besides the preferential flow pathway led to a greater short circuiting effect in these cells than in the ceramsite cell the short circuiting zone decreased the hrt potentially reducing the effective contact between porous microbial matter and pollutants garcia et al 2003 on the contrary the dead zone region in the ceramsite shaped cell was smaller than that in the other two due to the relatively small size of the pt10 and pt90 therefore the ceramsite shaped cell had greater hydraulic efficiency than the other two these results were verified by a column test showing that the cod removal of the ceramsite column was higher than those of the other two columns fig s4 however the biofilm was relatively denser in cell 3 due to its narrow pore throats the flow needed to penetrate the denser biofilm in the pore throats due to the lack of an obvious preferential flow pathway fig 12 which caused the head loss Œ¥h in cell 3 to increase faster than in the other two the same results were also observed in the column tests fig 4 the spatial and temporal biofilm development can be observed in situ using 2d optically transparent porous medium models however there exist certain limitations the main limitation of the 2d model is the reduction of the pore throats in the third dimension which may lead to the difference in the distribution of the dead zone 3d imaging techniques should be used in further investigation to provide insight into the third dimension on the other hand regular ceramsite is suggested to adopt as filter media in constructed wetland design due to its higher hydraulic performance according to the results however many factors will affect hydraulic performance in practical application process such as roots suspended solids etc therefore further research should be carried out to assess the seepage flow characteristic in a more realistic scenario 5 conclusions the interactions of accumulated biomass with the seepage flow properties of 2d porous media composed of zeolite gravel and ceramsite shape filter media were evaluated via the continual addition of artificial wastewater this work revealed that the filter morphology and bacterial growth and accumulation significantly impacted the water retention of saturated porous media the results showed that at a constant liquid flow rate the angular filter had a less uniform seepage flow field due to its disordered pore structure biofilm growth enhanced the preferential flow pathway in the zeolite and gravel shaped angular filter media and increased the short circuiting and dead zones moreover the distribution of the biofilm in the cells was related to the seepage flowrate and biofilm accumulated in the zones of the preferential flow pathway due to the abundant supply of oxygen and nutrients however biofilm growth almost did not change the position of the preferential seepage flow pathway and roughly stable preferential pathways were formed in the zeolite and gravel shaped cells when the specific biofilm growth rate was balanced by the detachment rate the water head loss of the ceramsite shaped cell was larger than those of the two others in the later stage of the experiment due to its relatively smaller size of throat despite this the ceramsite shaped cell had higher hydraulic efficiency with a smaller dead zone and short circuiting credit authorship contribution

5127,biofilm growth can impact seepage flow properties in the porous media thereby affecting the performance of the infiltration systems to better understand and characterize the biofilm distribution and its effect on seepage flow fields in the porous media with different morphologies two dimensional transparent flow cells were developed using x ray images of zeolite gravel and ceramsite columns to study the effect of biofilm development and the pore structure on seepage flow properties the results revealed that the filter morphology and biofilm growth significantly impacted the seepage flow field in porous media with biofilm growth a preferential flow pathway was more likely to be formed in angular filter cells zeolite shaped cells than spherical filter cells ceramsite shaped cells it was also found that microbial growth rate was closely related to seepage flowrate in 2d porous media cells the biofilm grew faster in the areas with higher seepage flowrate the biofilm accumulation did not seem to affect the location of the preferential seepage flow probably due to the high permeability of the biofilm in the large pore throats although the water head loss of ceramsite shaped cells was larger than that of two others due to its relatively smaller size of pore throat the ceramsite shaped cells presented small dead zone and short circuiting which means that ceramiste filter media had higher hydraulic efficiency keywords biofilm filter morphology porous medium seepage flow properties 1 introduction infiltration systems such as constructed wetlands are commonly used for the treatment of wastewater or stormwater discharges in infiltration systems the quality of infiltrated water improves progressively during its infiltration flow path through porous media as a consequence of physical chemical and biological processes perujo et al 2019 the performance of infiltration systems mainly relies on biofilm development within the porous media biofilms drive crucial ecosystem processes battin et al 2016 particularly porous medium provides an appropriate environment for bacterial attachment and biofilm development due to its inherently high surface to volume ratios valiei et al 2012 biofilm microorganisms are encased in a matrix of multi component hydrated biopolymers called extracellular polymeric substances eps and present increased resistance against external stresses flemming and wingender 2010 an excessive build up of microbial biomass cells and eps can cause fouling of the porous media known as bioclogging baveye et al 1998 hand et al 2008 brovelli et al 2009 carrel et al 2018a perujo et al 2019 bioclogging can affect the seepage flow by forming short circuiting and dead zones in porous media which can result in poor pollution removal zhu et al 2020 therefore it is of great significance to study how biofilm development affects the seepage flow in porous media given the importance of biofilm growth in porous media a considerable amount of research has been conducted in this area a number of the studies used columns or column like setups with filter media to study the influencing factors and process of bioclogging as well as the impact of bioclogging on hydraulic characteristics and transport properties engesgaard et al 2006 seifert and engesgaard 2007 hand et al 2008 mostafa and van geel 2015 zhou et al 2018 hua et al 2019 however current column studies on bioclogging are subject to several limitations thullner 2010 such as wall effect for very small columns tallarek et al 2001 and water flowing only along the length of the column in one dimensional systems in addition it is usually difficult to visualize the biofilm growth in porous media and its effect on the dynamic change of the seepage flow field due to its opacity thus two dimensional 2d experimental micro models have been developed to directly observe the biological growth in pores over time and space 2d micromodels are a common option for visualizing pore scale processes in the multi phase flow keller et al 1997 a 2d silicon pore imaging element consisting of a random width rectangular grid was introduced by dupin and mccarty 1999 dupin and mccarty 2000 they reported that the decrease in hydraulic conductivity was correlated with biological growth and its morphology and the sudden conductivity recoveries were correlated with sloughing events the morphology of biofilms in the porous media was also observed by valiei et al 2012 and hassanpourfard et al 2016 in their 2d microfluidic experimental setups they noticed that filamentous structures known as streamer were formed under the effect of fluid flow and then led to the clogging in a microfluidic device drescher et al 2013 also found biofilm streamers caused sudden and rapid clogging using a series of experiments in a microfluidic model coyte et al 2017 used a microfluidic device to simulate soil like porous environments they investigated the flow and biofilm interaction and revealed that hydrodynamics can profoundly affect the bacteria competition and evolvement in porous environments however these studies were performed using a mono species biofilm in regular rectangle or circle and uniform pore structure one of the critical factors pore morphology which controls biofilm formation and thus the development of the seepage flow field in porous media is still not well understood recently three dimensional experimental micro models have been developed to investigate and directly visualize biofilm growth and its effect on flow dynamics peszynska et al 2016 carrel et al 2018b these studies were carried out in the porous media constituted in most cases by homogeneous materials such as glass beads and homogeneous sands rubol et al 2018 explored the seepage flow in the porous media formed by irregularly shaped grains using particle image velocimetry piv and refractive index matching rim techniques however there are constraints in experimental sizes due to the limit of imaging techniques making it hard to monitor biofilm structures noninvasively at the macroscale carrel et al 2018b infiltration systems are usually filled with zeolite gravel and ceramsite and thus have heterogeneous porous morphology which affects bacterial growth harvey et al 1993 heterogeneities of both porous media and biofilm structures should be considered simultaneously kim et al 2010 however little is known about the interactions between seepage flow field and natural biofilm development the objective of this study is to acquire an in depth understanding of biofilm development and its interaction with fluid flow properties in porous media of different morphology to improve our understanding of bioclogging process in the heterogeneous pore structure the effect of the filter morphology on the change in hydraulic conductivity was investigated in column experiments based on this 2d porous media flow cells pmfcs produced according to x ray computed tomography x ct images of the columns filled with zeolite gravel and ceramsite were used to observe the interaction between the seepage flow change and biofilm growth in different pore structures the seepage flow characteristic and hydraulic efficiency with biofilm development in pmfcs with different filter morphologies was also investigated 2 methods and materials 2 1 experimental setup three identical saturated cylindrical poly methyl methacrylate columns 15 cm in diameter and 70 cm high were constructed as shown in fig 1 two piezometer tubes were used to measure the water head at the filter media surface and the outlet to determine the water head loss through the filter media a perforated plate with holes 1 mm in diameter was placed at the bottom of the filter media which prevented particles movement and provided a uniform outflow a peristaltic pump provided a constant flow rate to the column from an upstream tank the artificial wastewater which was prepared according to zhong and wu 2013 table s1 was used in the experiment zeolite gravel and ceramsite particles were used as filter media in the experiment these are commonly used in infiltration systems and represent different morphologies with angular less angular and spherical shapes the grain size of the substrates was 8 10 mm the 2d porous pmfc system was set up for monitoring the biofilm morphology and hydraulic characteristics in porous media a schematic of the 2d pmfc system used in this study is shown in fig 2 the experimental system was consisted of three parts 1 a peristaltic pump with a pressure regulator to supply artificial wastewater at a constant flow rate 2 2d pmfcs containing different pore structures formed by commonly used filter media with different shapes zeolite wang et al 2020 gravel sapdhare et al 2019 and ceramsite shao et al 2019 and 3 effluent ports the porous media zone of the 2d pmfcs was 85 cm high 60 cm wide and 0 5 cm thick the 2d pmfc media were produced according to x ct images of filter media fig s1 through laser engraving technology and were arranged between two ultra clear glass corresponding to the x ct images therefore the pore channels and pore nodes of the pmfcs were consistent with the real 2d pore structures of the filter medium three pmfcs were produced corresponding to the porous media zeolite gravel and ceramsite and named cell 1 cell 2 and cell 3 respectively the porosities of cell 1 cell 2 and cell 3 were 0 71 0 66 and 0 59 respectively the pmfcs allowed clear visualization of the flow field and biofilm growth in a porous medium 2 2 experimental procedure the columns were operated identically with vertical down flow for about three months artificial wastewater was fed into the top of each column and discharged from the bottom through a perforated pipe the columns were saturated by controlling the flow rate they were operated continuously at a relatively high hydraulic loading of 0 41 m d each pmfc was mounted in a machined holder to which the tubes were connected at first inoculation was achieved by injecting the pre culture bacterial solution firstly at a constant flow rate of 5 ml min into the cells after inoculation the artificial wastewater was fed into the pmfcs from the top at room temperature 20 25 c in dark the height adjustable outlet was used to ensure the constant flowrate in the cells the average flow velocity in the all cells was 0 20 0 21 mm s and the reynold numbers were 1 7 1 8 and 2 1 respectively in cells 1 2 and 3 three parallel experiments were conducted to analyze the effect of pore structure on seepage flow field 2 3 measurements and methods the hydraulic conductivity k m d for the columns was obtained weekly by measuring the water level difference between the two pitot tubes and using darcy s law eq 1 1 k q l Œ¥ h a where q m3 d is the flow rate Œ¥h m is the water level difference between the two pitot tubes water head l m is the path length through the substrate and a m2 is the surface area of the column dye tracer was used to visualize the change in flow patterns in porous media affected by biofilm growth dye tracer tests were performed every 3 days by injecting red dye at the inlet of the pmfc the red tracer was prepared by mixing red ink and small amount of xanthan gum and ethanol to lower its diffusivity in water the dye tracer had a density close to water and was harmless to the biofilm images of dye propagation in the reactor were processed using matlab sequential pictures were imported as rgb matrices for each pixel the color change ratio was compared to the background color thereby the flow path and dead zones were analyzed by accumulating dye saturation fraction in porous space grayscale images of the biofilm and porous media were taken every 24 h these images were then converted to binary images based on the optimal threshold computed by the image thresholding algorithm yang et al 2001 and were used to quantify the biofilm quantity according to the areal parameters of the biofilm proportions kim et al 2010 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analysis was conducted using spss version 22 analysis of variance was performed to assess the significant differences in seepage flow and biofilm growth redundancy analysis rda was used to determine associations between morphological factors of filter media pore structure properties and seepage flow field characteristics 3 results 3 1 characteristics of filter media and pore structure x ct technique was used to investigate the morphology of the filter medium and the pore structure after 2d images of the three filter media were obtained fig s1 data processing and analysis were performed on the statistical results for the morphologies of the filter media and pore structures to characterize the particle shapes different shape factors were calculated according to the definition of blott and pye 2008 l and s the longest and shortest edge dimensions of the minimum bounding box enclosing the particles were used as shape descriptors fig s2 moreover the term angularity ap is used to indicate the degree of angularity of the particles kuo and freeman 2000 which can be calculated as 2 ap p convex p ellipse 2 where p convex is the convex perimeter p ellipse is the perimeter of an equivalent ellipse which is a fictitious ellipse that has the same area and aspect ratio as the aggregate particle the roundness l s and ap were also used to describe the particle shape the morphology of the filter media is shown in table 1 as shown in table 1 the l s roundness and ap of the ceramsite particles is smallest followed by the gravel and zeolite particles the ceramsite particles had the lowest degree of angularity and were closest to round while the zeolite particles had the highest degree of angularity and lowest degree of roundness based on x ct images of the filter media the topological structure of the pore space was extracted the pore space in the substrate can be simplified as relatively large pore chambers connected by relatively small pore throats zhang et al 2018 fig s3 the flux of water through porous media is proportional to the pore throat diameter ewing and gupta 1994 the pore throat structure of the three 2d filter media was quantitatively evaluated and the results are shown in fig 3 and table 2 as shown in table 2 the average pore radius of the zeolite medium was 8 35 mm while those of gravel and ceramsite were 7 35 and 6 13 mm respectively similarly the pore throats of the filter ceramsite medium were smaller than those of zeolite and gravel indicating that the pore throats formed by the regular spherical particles were much smaller than those formed by irregular angular particles fig 3 also shows pore throats larger than 2 5 mm distributed in the zeolite and gravel shaped cells which could affect the flow distribution in the porous media vogel and roth 2001 moreover the pore structure of the most angular filter particles zeolite was observed to be the most disordered followed by the gravel and ceramsite shaped filter media 3 2 changes in hydraulic conductivity in column experiment fig 4 shows the change in the hydraulic conductivity of the three columns with different filter media the initial hydraulic conductivity of ceramsite was 3900 m d which was much higher than those of zeolite 2400 m d and gravel 2600 m d which is consistent with previous research by sperry and peirce 1995 the shape of individual particles affected the hydraulic conductivity and head loss and porous media comprising irregular particles exhibited a lower hydraulic conductivity during operation the biofilm growth in the porous media resulted from pollution degradation filled the pore space changed hydrologic properties and decreased the hydraulic conductivity during the first 40 days the hydraulic conductivity of zeolite and gravel columns decreased significantly to 310 and 89 m d due to the build up of microbial biomass in the porous medium while the hydraulic conductivity of the ceramsite column only decreased to 1050 m d moreover the rate of decrease of the hydraulic conductivity in the ceramsite column ranged from 1 4 to 7 2 per day during the first 40 days which was much smaller than those of the zeolite and gravel columns during the second set of experiments the rate of decrease of the hydraulic conductivity in the ceramsite column was larger than that of the other two columns and the hydraulic conductivity decreased from 1050 to 19 m d which was smaller than 105 m d for the zeolite column and 26 m d for the gravel column at the end of the experiment 3 3 biofilm growth and distribution in different cells the pmfcs were firstly inoculated with the artificial wastewater by injecting at a constant flow rate of 5 ml min into the cells natural habitat microbes attachment and natural biofilm formation occurred on the surfaces of the 2d media meanwhile some filamentous structures consisting of a few bacteria were also observed on the surfaces of some 2d media fig s5 within 6 8 days after inoculation uniform biofilms of detectable thickness could be observed on the surface of the media with time the biofilms grew thicker and began to clog the pore throats the biofilms were denser close to the substrate surfaces and sparser away from them according to the grayscale images fig s5 the biofilm distribution in the pmfcs with time is shown in fig 5 no obvious difference in biofilm thickness was detected between the upstream and downstream ends of the cells during the first 6 days of incubation with time the biofilm growth became more randomly distributed and the biofilm distribution along the cells was inhomogeneous some places showed dense biofilm distributions while others showed almost no biofilm fig 5 overall biofilm accumulation preferentially occurred closer to the inlet this was in qualitative agreement with the experimental observation of biofilm growth in a number of systems simoni et al 2001 the change in biofilm quantity with time is shown in fig 6 during the first 3 days the biofilm grew slowly after that the growth rate increased significantly and at the 11th day the biofilm proportion reached 50 60 biofilm accumulation continued until the growth rate was balanced by the detachment rate and then the biofilm growth reached the stationary phase before decreasing slowly at the end of the experiment this process was consistent with the microbial growth phases lag exponential and stationary moreover it is noteworthy that the biofilm proportion of the ceramsite shaped cell was higher than that of the other two cells due to its low porosity which indicated that there was a high risk of bioclogging in the ceramsite shaped cell 3 4 seepage flow field in the 2d cells to investigate how biofilm growth influences the seepage flow through a porous environment the flow distribution in 2d cells was observed through dye tracer tests the flow fields at the first and 15th days are shown in fig 7 before bioclogging the magnitude of this flow diversion depended on the specific geometry of the pore space the seepage flow field was fairly homogeneous in the ceramsite shaped cell while the flow field within each cross section of zeolite shaped and gravel shaped cells was non uniform this non uniformity reflected that fluid moved through preferred pathways in a porous medium thereby bypassing large portions of the porous system which was known as preferential flow lin 2010 fig 7 shows that the principal flow in the cells was not all along well connected highly porous pathways and the formation of preferential channels probably resulted from the inflow configuration and the predominant viscous forces in the momentum transport through the complex void geometry andrade et al 1999 after 15 days the seepage flow field was observed to be less spatially uniform in the cross sections of the cells shown in fig 7 d f and fig s6 the flow was already concentrated in a single channel in the zeolite and gravel shaped flow cells fig 7 g and h resulting in more principal flow pathways through the media this indicated that the growing biofilm affected the pore structure and led to the formation of preferential seepage flow paths and slow velocity zones which was consistent with the results of rubol et al 2014 that microbial process in the heterogeneous medium enhanced the spatially heterogeneous distribution of infiltration rates with time similarly the seepage flow field in the ceramsite shaped cell also became less uniform but the smallest change was observed in both the high and low flow zones fig 7 i moreover the seepage flow field in the ceramsite shaped cell appeared more uniform than that in the two others the area of dye coverage derived from the vertical profiles illustrated the preferential seepage flow pathways which was active for nutrient transport the preferential flow pathway in the cells after one hydraulic retention time hrt is shown in figs 8 and s7 initially the flow pathways in the upper parts of the cells appeared rather uniformly distributed and preferential flow occurred and contributed to the drainage in the lower parts a similar phenomenon was observed where the profile of water infiltration in soil could be divided into a distribution layer near the surface that typically appeared saturated and below a conveyance zone where preferential flow paths formed kim et al 2005 moreover the cells presented distinctive flow field distributions with different pore structures the more uniform flow field was observed in the porous media with larger roundness filter media which indicated that pore structure complexity determined quantitatively different generic transport behavior bijeljic et al 2013 as the biofilm grew preferential seepage flow pathways developed more obviously biomass grew and formed large clusters that occluded pores forcing the flow through preferential pathways resulting in the formation of persistent preferential flow paths bottero et al 2013 some small preferential flow pathways were even blocked and disappeared with further biofilm accumulation especially in cell 1 zeolite shaped cell the pathways decreased abruptly to about 40 and remained constant at about 20 from a depth of 0 to 30 cm fig s9 and significant flow occurred through the preferential flow paths however it was still found that the flow in cell 3 was more uniform than in cells 1 and 2 therefore the preferential seepage flow pathways were strengthened by the microbial activity and the effect of biofilm growth on the flow field depended on the pore structure however the microbial activity also responded to the environmental conditions established by preferential flow such that the physical and biological processes strengthened each other and perpetuated the preferential flow in the cells which disagreed with previous studies where the flow channels changed in size and location sharp et al 2005 bottero et al 2013 probably due to differences in the flow rates of the feed water 3 5 hydraulic efficiency in the cells hydraulic efficiency is an important parameter for pollutant removal efficiency assessment mayo and mutamba 2004 garcia et al 2005 liu et al 2010 poor seepage flow distribution and dead zones can lead to unsatisfactory hydraulic performance and reduce treatment efficiency wang et al 2014 by observing the distribution of tracer solution in the pmfcs during injection the hydraulic performance of the cells with different filter morphology can be assessed the areas free of dye after continuous injection for 1 hrt represented fields of low flow velocity or no flow which are traditionally called dead zones distributions of dead zones obtained using dye tracer were analyzed and are illustrated in fig 9 the pore structure and bioclogging significantly impacted the flow path forming various dead zones after 15 days of incubation the bioclogged cells showed a whole piece shaped distribution of dead zones in the bottom left and the proportion of dead zones reached 54 7 in cell 1 in cell 2 dead zones formed mainly to the left while cell 3 had dead zones distributed in patches moreover the areas of no seepage flow and slow seepage flow in cells 2 and 3 became smaller as shown in fig 9 b and c indicating that filter medium heterogeneity may promote the development of preferential paths and dead zones instead the areas where water was rapidly exchanged by tracer can be considered short circuiting zones the short circuiting zones in cell 1 were found to be larger than that in the other two due to preferential flow this indicated that zeolite shaped filter media can lead to a greater short circuiting effect whereas cell 3 showed the lowest proportion of short circuiting zones indicating that the ceramsite shaped cell yielded higher hydraulic efficiency 4 discussion 4 1 interaction of biofilm growth and seepage flow field the interaction of seepage hydraulic characteristics and biofilm growth in filter media with tortuous geometries is of great interest because of its prevalence in many natural and engineered systems drescher et al 2013 in comparing the results shown in fig 5 and fig 7 it is noteworthy that the zones of large seepage flow velocity coincided with those of the biofilm distribution these results illustrated that bacterial growth and accumulation significantly impacted on the seepage flow field in the porous media which was consistent with the results of yarwood et al 2006 the biofilm growth rate in the 3rd to 10th day and the hydrodynamic characteristics in the different pores of the cells were analyzed relations between biofilm growth and the reynolds number are shown in fig 10 it was shown that the biofilm growth in the cell 1 r 0 814 p 0 01 cell2 r 0 728 p 0 01 and cell 3 r 0 536 p 0 01 were positively correlated with the seepage flowrate which was consistent with the finding of ostvar et al 2018 that biofilm growth was improved at the intermediate and highest flow rates the results were probably due to the competing mass transfer nutrient delivery as morales et al 2010 also reported that highly active microbial zones were predominantly affected by the increased oxygen and nutrient availability in the preferential flow paths besides the biofilm growth was negatively weakly correlated with depth in the cell 1 r 0 111 p 0 05 cell 2 r 0 372 p 0 05 and cell 3 r 0 413 p 0 05 the main reason probably is the low dissolved oxygen delivery in the deep layer compared to nutrient rich inflow given the biofilm growth is sensitive to the availability of oxygen chang et al 2015 the inhomogeneity in the spatial distribution of biofilms appears to be linked to the distribution of the seepage flow rate with the formation of the preferential flow pathways the biofilm was found to accumulate mainly in the zones with relatively high flow conditions whereas in the regions isolated from the flow the biofilm almost stopped growing due to limited nutrient and oxygen supplies fig 5 moreover the preferential flow pathway was found to not change basically its location even though a biofilm patch proliferated in the pathway which was different from previous studies that flow channels were dynamic changing in size number and location after bioclogging sharp et al 2005 coyte et al 2015 this was probably because the biofilm was sparsely affected by shear stresses at the high flow rate and thus the permeability of the biomass significantly affected the seepage flow properties throughout the porous medium pintelon et al 2012 similar results were reported by deng et al 2013 where main flow channeling was still present and mainly followed the same channel when the permeability of biofilm was increased to 1 10 12 m2 in the preferential channel the biomass continued to grow once this was balanced by detachment a stable flow channel was formed bottero et al 2013 4 2 effect of filter media morphology on seepage flow field given that the pollution load can move preferentially into the environment through preferential flow in the infiltration facilities the research on the seepage flow characteristic has increased in importance the vast majority of preferential flow is heterogeneity related lin 2010 however a key problem facing seepage in the porous media at present is the current knowledge of water flow in porous media does not fully reflect the processes at the pore scale therefore it is important to investigate the seepage flow characteristic in porous media with different morphology the 2d pmfc experiments showed that flow and transport within porous media are governed by their porous structure porous structure is indicated by the factors of ap roundness pt10 pt80 pt20 pt90 ptx is the pore throat size corresponding to x greater in the all pore throats while the seepage flow characteristics are indicated by the factors of dz the percent of dead zone area at the end of the experiment and v 1 0 the percent of the area with flow velocity greater than 1 0 mm s at the end of the experiment relations between porous media properties and the seepage flow field characteristics are shown in the redundancy analysis rda plot in fig 11 the axes 1 and 2 explained 90 9 of the total variability in porous structure and flow field characteristics the data showed that pt90 r 0 748 p 0 05 r 0 832 p 0 05 and pt10 r 0 988 p 0 05 r 0 998 p 0 05 were positively correlated with the morphology factors of the filter media ap and roundness which indicated that the size of the largest and smallest part of pore throat in the cells all decreased with the ap and roundness of the filter media pearson correlation analysis also revealed a positive correlation between v 1 0 r 0 712 p 0 05 and pt10 the data revealed that high speed flow area increased with the increase of pt10 which indicated the existence of larger pore throats appeared to play a central role in the formation of preferential flow in the porous media during the biofilm development the biofilm development in the porous media retarded flow and moved the fluid flow to larger throats significantly decreasing the quantitative efficiency of the system langergraber et al 2003 under low reynolds conditions the viscous effects were dominant andrade et al 1999 so that the upper boundaries strongly affected the flow distribution therefore preferential channels formed and became increasingly obvious because the increasingly inhomogeneous flow distribution formed due to the existence of larger pore throat fig 8 the particles with higher roundness and ap will form a larger proportion of large throats in the filter media therefore angular and irregular filters particles tend to form preferential seepage flow pathways with biofilm growth besides it was found that dz of the porous media was correlated with the pt10 r 0 672 p 0 05 the data indicated that the decrease of larger throat size also helped to reduce the proportion of the dead zone meanwhile it is worth noting that dz was also positively correlated with pt90 r 0 774 p 0 05 which implied that small throat in the porous media also can decrease the dead zone the main reason probably is that the proper distribution of small throats may help to interrupt the preferential flow path under the premise that the size of the larger throat is also relatively small thereby helping to increase the uniformity of the seepage flow field 4 3 effect of bioclogging and filter morphology on hydraulic efficiency due to the formation of a preferential seepage flow pathway the dead zones were enlarged with biofilm growth in the zeolite and gravel shaped cells and a considerable proportion of the dead zone was distributed in the two cells which was closely related to treatment efficiency wang et al 2014 besides the preferential flow pathway led to a greater short circuiting effect in these cells than in the ceramsite cell the short circuiting zone decreased the hrt potentially reducing the effective contact between porous microbial matter and pollutants garcia et al 2003 on the contrary the dead zone region in the ceramsite shaped cell was smaller than that in the other two due to the relatively small size of the pt10 and pt90 therefore the ceramsite shaped cell had greater hydraulic efficiency than the other two these results were verified by a column test showing that the cod removal of the ceramsite column was higher than those of the other two columns fig s4 however the biofilm was relatively denser in cell 3 due to its narrow pore throats the flow needed to penetrate the denser biofilm in the pore throats due to the lack of an obvious preferential flow pathway fig 12 which caused the head loss Œ¥h in cell 3 to increase faster than in the other two the same results were also observed in the column tests fig 4 the spatial and temporal biofilm development can be observed in situ using 2d optically transparent porous medium models however there exist certain limitations the main limitation of the 2d model is the reduction of the pore throats in the third dimension which may lead to the difference in the distribution of the dead zone 3d imaging techniques should be used in further investigation to provide insight into the third dimension on the other hand regular ceramsite is suggested to adopt as filter media in constructed wetland design due to its higher hydraulic performance according to the results however many factors will affect hydraulic performance in practical application process such as roots suspended solids etc therefore further research should be carried out to assess the seepage flow characteristic in a more realistic scenario 5 conclusions the interactions of accumulated biomass with the seepage flow properties of 2d porous media composed of zeolite gravel and ceramsite shape filter media were evaluated via the continual addition of artificial wastewater this work revealed that the filter morphology and bacterial growth and accumulation significantly impacted the water retention of saturated porous media the results showed that at a constant liquid flow rate the angular filter had a less uniform seepage flow field due to its disordered pore structure biofilm growth enhanced the preferential flow pathway in the zeolite and gravel shaped angular filter media and increased the short circuiting and dead zones moreover the distribution of the biofilm in the cells was related to the seepage flowrate and biofilm accumulated in the zones of the preferential flow pathway due to the abundant supply of oxygen and nutrients however biofilm growth almost did not change the position of the preferential seepage flow pathway and roughly stable preferential pathways were formed in the zeolite and gravel shaped cells when the specific biofilm growth rate was balanced by the detachment rate the water head loss of the ceramsite shaped cell was larger than those of the two others in the later stage of the experiment due to its relatively smaller size of throat despite this the ceramsite shaped cell had higher hydraulic efficiency with a smaller dead zone and short circuiting credit authorship contribution

5128,previous studies of confluences have mainly concentrated on their hydrodynamic characteristics and morphological dynamics however the increasing environmental pollution in rivers has resulted in abrupt variations in water quality at confluences thus affecting the ecosystems in river networks therefore more attention should be paid to the pollutant distribution and mixing processes at confluences in this study several field experiments on pollutant concentrations were conducted at a large asymmetric confluence with a discordant bed and wide shallow channel in northern china where a heavily polluted tributary known as the fen river joins the yellow river the results displayed that the heavily polluted tributary seriously affected the water quality at the confluence especially in the downstream channel near the tributary the contaminations at the confluence present a relatively strong temporal variability the organic matter and dissolved oxygen show a similar seasonal variability with each other whereas ammonia nitrogen and total phosphorus are also similar to each other but they have a different variability from the first group these pollutants mostly demonstrated the same spatial distribution characteristics with large horizontal concentration differences at the confluence the standard deviation of the cross sectional concentration gradually decreased with the downstream mixing of contaminants nonetheless under conventional hydrological conditions these contaminants were not completely mixed through a length of 27 river widths compared with a concordant bed this discordant confluence exhibited a relatively fast mixing rate the key factor affecting the mixing process at the confluence was the discharge ratio exceptionally during the irrigation period march april owing to the extremely low discharge of the tributary the main stream flowed backward into the tributary which enhanced the mixing motion to constitute an approximately full mixing regime at the mouth of the tributary these results are of great importance in understanding the degree of contamination spatiotemporal distribution and mixing dynamics of characteristic pollutants at complex river confluences keywords river confluence environmental pollutants mixing dynamics yellow river 1 introduction river confluences are important nodes in a river network where confluent flows converge to produce a complex flow structure mosley 1976 best 1987 rhoads and johnson 2018 bed morphology riley and rhoads 2012 zhang et al 2015 2020a matter mixing gaudet and roy 1995 biron et al 2004 a water environment tang et al 2018 yuan et al 2019 and ecosystems gualtieri et al 2017 these confluent flows are becoming one of the hot spots of environmental hydraulics tributaries carrying a large number of pollutants join the main channel and induce an abrupt change in the spatiotemporal distribution of pollutants at the confluence this can affect the coordinated development of the ecosystem as well as pose a threat to downstream water quality safety especially when rivers serve as a potable source of water li and morioka 1999 mixing processes and the influence distance of pollutants are the key factors for the assessments of downstream water quality and environmental protection therefore it is considerably important to accurately understand the spatiotemporal distribution and mixing dynamics of contaminants at a confluence for water environment management and remediation as well as the ecological restoration of a river network numerous studies of confluences have been performed regarding their hydrodynamic characteristics sediment transport and bed morphology and consistent conclusions have been yielded from a laboratory setting mosley 1976 best and reid 1984 best 1987 fieldwork ashmore et al 1992 biron et al 1993 de serres et al 1999 rhoads and sukhodolov 2008 and numerical simulations bradbrook et al 2000 2001 biron et al 2004 the complex flow structure at the confluence hydrodynamic zone chz shows obvious three dimensional characteristics and consists of flow stagnation deflection separation acceleration and recovery zones as well as a shear layer mixing interface best 1987 in addition the helical motion is also the main factor governing mixing and bed erosion at the confluence however the helical motion does not necessarily occur at the large and wide confluence with a width depth ratio greater than 100 parsons et al 2007 zhang et al 2020a and the flow separation is not persistent at the confluence with a relatively smooth junction corner roy et al 1988 roy and bergeron 1990 ashmore et al 1992 rhoads and sukhodolov 2001 the typical features of bed morphology are mainly composed of a scour hole avalanche faces sedimentation in the stagnation zone and bars located in the separation zone as well as the center of the downstream channel best 1987 1988 leite ribeiro et al 2012 guill√©n lude√±a et al 2015 yuan et al 2018 the key factors that control and influence the flow structure and bed morphology of the confluence include the plane symmetry junction angle momentum flux ratio and bed concordance rhoads and johnson 2018 however the distribution characteristics and mixing dynamics of contaminants at the confluence require further study for example a recent study had found that many emerging pollutants at the confluence pose a threat to the water security of the junction mijangos et al 2018 of course sediment nutrients and water nutrients are the major environmental factors at a confluence such as organic matter om nitrogen n and phosphorus p since these factors have important effects on the community structure and growth metabolism of aquatic organisms campodonico et al 2015 xu et al 2018 li et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b moreover significant alterations in n and p can cause water eutrophication gireeshkumar et al 2013 allison et al 2014 phosphorus pollution in the surface sediment of a confluence contains a significant spatiotemporal variation and special dynamic characteristics and the p contamination is more severe than that of the downstream reach additionally the flooding process dissolved oxygen do and water temperature are the main factors affecting a p contamination allison et al 2014 yuan et al 2019 therefore an abrupt change of water quality at a confluence may cause serious harm to its downstream water environment and drinking water safety at present there are relatively few studies on the contamination level and the spatiotemporal distribution of typical pollutants such as organic matter ammonia nitrogen and total phosphorus at confluences and these unclear contamination characteristics deserve further study mixing within and downstream of confluences is usually evaluated using conserved substances in water as tracers including temperature conductivity ph and stable oxygen isotopes gaudet and roy 1995 rhoads and kenworthy 1995 1998 kabeya et al 2008 previous studies have suggested that lateral mixing at large confluences is a slow process and the distance for complete mixing often requires hundreds of channel widths rathbun and rostad 2004 lane et al 2008 laraque et al 2009 bouchez et al 2010 however the mixing rates of small confluences are relatively fast and sufficient mixing can occur within a short distance adjacent to the confluence gaudet and roy 1995 rhoads and kenworthy 1995 rhoads and sukhodolov 2001 biron et al 2004 the mixing rate and distance are often related to the discharge ratio momentum flux ratio density difference cross sectional area and bed height difference at the confluence lewis and rhoads 2015 indicated that an increase in the momentum flux ratio could accelerate the mixing rate at a small confluence additionally the cross sectional area was negatively correlated with the mixing rate and the density difference would cause a buoyancy effect that influenced the mixing rate compared with a concordant bed enhanced mixing at a discordant confluence has been attributed to a distortion in the mixing layer gaudet and roy 1995 de serres et al 1999 biron et al 2004 the extent to which these findings can be generalized to large asymmetric confluences with complex configurations such as wide shallow channels large differences in discharge and discordant beds remains poorly understood moreover the tracers in previous studies may not completely represent the actual mixing processes of pollutants in the water additional studies are needed to more comprehensively understand the mixing dynamics at these complex confluences the present study investigates the spatiotemporal distribution and mixing dynamics of typical environmental pollutants at a complex river confluence the hydrodynamic data and characteristic environmental pollutant organic matter ammonia nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations were monitored for several times in field at the confluence of the yellow river and fen river in northern china this confluence is large and asymmetric with wide shallow channels large differences in discharge a discordant bed and a severely polluted tributary that seriously affects the confluence s water quality using the field data for a series of variable hydrological conditions this study illustrates the contamination characteristics and spatiotemporal distribution of the pollutants at the confluence investigates the mixing pattern and rate and reveals the key factors controlling the mixing process the results of this study are helpful in understanding the spatiotemporal distribution and the mixing dynamic of typical environmental pollutants at natural large asymmetric confluences with discordant bed and large differences in discharge 2 experiments and analysis 2 1 study region the yellow river yr is the second largest river in china and the fifth largest in the world which originates in the sanjiangyuan region of qinghai province and flows eastward into the bohai sea fig 1 a the yr is affectionately known as the mother river because it provides drinking water sources for approximately 114 million people and irrigates 110 000 acres of farmland every day bai et al 2015 additionally the water quality of the yr has historically been relatively good since 1998 the water body of the yr basin has become gradually polluted and the water environment has deteriorated zhao et al 2020 this is especially noticeable at some confluences where seriously polluted tributaries join the yr and is a consequence of the development of industry agriculture and the social economy zhao et al 2020 one prominent example includes the confluence of the yellow river and fen river which is located in the middle reaches of the yellow river fen river fr the second largest tributary of the yellow river is located in shanxi province which has a semi arid climate in past decades the runoff of the fr has continued to decline because of the impacts of climate and anthropogenic perturbations liang et al 2015 in addition shanxi province has a coal reserve accounting for one fourth of china s total coal resources the water quality in the fr basin has seriously damaged by the agricultural non point source pollution anpsp and the point source pollution psp the psp is mainly caused by excessive exploitation and synthesized utilization of coal in shanxi province yang et al 2018 recent research demonstrated that the concentrations of total nitrogen ammonia nitrogen nitrite nitrogen total organic carbon and coliform in the fr greatly exceeded the national criteria zhao et al 2020 the color of water body in fr is black and there is a distinct color difference interface at the confluence of the fr and the yr in this study the confluence of the yr and fr located in miaoqian village wanrong county shanxi province in northern china was selected for field experiments fig 1 the drainage area of the yr upstream of the confluence is 497 600 km2 and that of the fr is 38 700 km2 the average discharge of the yr and fr was 586 1 m3 s 1 and 30 2 m3 s 1 between september 2016 and september 2018 respectively the average discharge ratio between the fr and the yr is 0 06 the upstream land cover consists mainly of agricultural land and china s loess plateau the confluence of the yr and the fr is a large asymmetric confluence with a 41 geometric angle between the two confluent flows a recent study by the authors demonstrated that the confluence was characterized by complex channel configuration and hydrodynamic characteristics zhang et al 2020a the geomorphologic features of the channel bed are composed of a beach at the upstream junction corner a small scour hole and a long narrow scour belt located at the immediate downstream of the confluence and a bed discordance with a depth difference of 2 m between the two confluent channels the tributary bed below to the main stream fig 1 b the flow field structure is mainly divided into flow stagnation zone deflection zone shear layer mixing interface and recovery area however there is no obvious flow separation area and helical motion fig 1 c to understand the spatial temporal distribution characteristics and mixing dynamics of typical contaminants at the confluence of yr and fr nine monitoring sections and forty five water sampling sites were defined within an area of 707 470 m2 for the field experiments fig 1 b among them two sections were respectively arranged in reaches of the yr sections a and b and fr sections j and k upstream of the confluence and five sections of c g were set up within and downstream of the confluence five water sampling sites were arranged in each section which were successively named a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 etc from the left bank to the right bank of the channel 2 2 sampling and analysis we conducted nine sampling monitoring tests r1 r9 at the confluence from november 27 2016 to may 10 2018 table 1 in each measurement event forty five water samples were collected at the confluence by a handheld plexiglass surface water sampler size œÜ 150 mm h 200 mm volume 3 5 l during sampling workers arrived at the monitoring point by a boat and collected water samples at 0 5 m below the surface with the plexiglass sampler each sample was divided into two parts one part was used for on site measurements of dissolved oxygen do and ph and the other part was quickly transferred to a 500 ml polyethylene bottle stored in a 4 incubator and brought back to the laboratory for chemical oxygen demand cod as an indicator of organic matter in water ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and total phosphorus tp testing do and ph were measured by an orion startm a326 portable ph rdo do meter relative accuracy 0 2 mg l 1 and 0 002 for do and ph respectively cod nh3 n and tp were analyzed according to the potassium dichromate method nessler s reagents spectrophotometer method and the ultraviolet spectrophotometric method uv 2450 shimadzu respectively the methods were all based on the water and wastewater monitoring and analysis methods mepprc 2002 water levels channel widths topography discharges and three dimensional velocities were additionally measured in experiment r1 november 27 2016 r2 august 5 2017 and r7 mar 31 2018 and the details referred to the author s recent research zhang et al 2020a the mean depth of yr at immediately upstream channel of confluence is 1 03 m and that of fr is 1 43 m the average depth of downstream confluence is 1 78 m discharges in other experiments were obtained from the official website of the yellow river conservancy commission 2 3 data analysis to understand the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of typical pollutants at the confluence post processing analysis of the concentration data was performed using one way analysis of variance anova and multidimensional scaling mds in the statistical package for social sciences spss version 17 0 the one way anova test was mainly used to examine the spatiotemporal variability of pollutant concentrations the mds was used to compare and establish the relationships between the characteristics of samples yuan et al 2019 the substances spatial distribution was drawn using the software package mike zero 2014 with a method that interpolates the substance concentrations at each grid node 2 4 mixing rates and metric to evaluate the mixing process and rate at the confluence the standard deviation œÉ was calculated for substances concentrations in each monitoring section the standard deviation can be used to measure the variance of pollutant concentration in each cross section biron et al 2004 along the direction of flow the œÉ of a given section will gradually decrease the slope of œÉ versus longitudinal distance can reflect the mixing rate although substances are degraded and transformed by microorganisms in the water while moving downstream with the water flow the change in concentration resulted from degradation and transformation can be ignored in such a small measurement area the distance between the cross section c and cross section g was merely 1212 4 m wang et al 2012 pointed out that the cod and nh3 n degradation coefficients from longmen to tongguan section of the yellow river including the study area were 0 29 day and 0 17 day respectively after calculation the microbial degradation amounts of cod and nh3 n within the study region are only 0 4 and 0 3 respectively therefore the influence of microbial degradation on substance concentrations is not considered temporarily in this study deviation from complete mixing Œ¥ for the concentration of pollutants at each sampling site is defined as follows 1 Œ¥ i c i c p c p 100 where ci is the concentration of pollutants at each site and cp is the predicted concentration after complete mixing gaudet and roy 1995 the predicted concentration cp is calculated as follows 2 c p c 1 q 1 c 2 q 2 q 1 q 2 where c is the pollutant concentration q is discharge and the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the tributary and main stream respectively to further understand the mixing level in different confluent and incoming conditions at the confluence a quantified mixing metric based on the standard deviation was computed for a synthesis upstream section and for the farthest downstream section g lewis and rhoads 2015 this synthesis upstream section consisted of the concentration data of two confluent flows sections cross section a for yr cross section j for fr which was interpreted as the cross section of the exact location where the two flows met the average concentrations of the two upstream cross sections cross section a and j were used to obtain the standard deviation in concentration œÉ us for incoming flows when no mixing had occurred the normalized mixing metric œÉ xn is computed as follows 3 œÉ xn œÉ g œÉ us where the subscript xn represents each specific experiment œÉ g is the standard deviation of cross section g completely mixed conditions at cross section g correspond to œÉ g 0 in these cases œÉ xn also equals 0 therefore the normalized metric defines the fraction of mixing downstream of the initial flow convergence over the interval of 0 to 1 ranging from no mixing 1 to fully mixed conditions 0 the normalized mixing metric is comparable between dates with different incoming flow conditions and contaminant concentrations to determine the possible relationships between the spatial change in substances mixing within the chz and the potential controlling factors of mixing the change in œÉ xn Œ¥œÉ xn was defined as follows lewis and rhoads 2015 4 Œ¥ œÉ xn 1 œÉ xn where the Œ¥œÉ xn represents the change in œÉ xn within the chz the greater the Œ¥œÉ xn the stronger mixing presents at the confluence Œ¥œÉ xn 1 correspond to fully mixing at the cross section g 3 results and discussion 3 1 contaminations at the confluence in the yr reach immediately upstream of the confluence the low values of cod nh3 n and tp mean values of 27 37 0 86 mg l 1 0 41 0 08 mg l 1 and 0 34 0 02 mg l 1 respectively indicated that the yr had a relatively good water quality fig 2 however the cod nh3 n and tp concentrations at the mouth of fr were relatively high with average values of 69 98 1 95 mg l 1 2 63 1 14 mg l 1 and 0 57 0 09 mg l 1 respectively fig 2 these results are attributed to the serious pollution from the upper reaches of the basin obviously the small standard deviations of the concentrations indicated that the water quality in the section was more uniform before the convergence of the two streams in comparison the organic pollution ammonia nitrogen pollution and phosphorus pollution of fr were 2 6 times 6 4 times and 1 7 times higher than that of the yr respectively similarly there were some differences in do between the two confluent rivers and were mainly reflected in the low do value in fr and the high do value in yr not shown in the figure these differences can be ascribed to the larger pollutant concentration in fr substances in fr along with the flow penetrated the yr which seriously damaged the water quality at the confluence within and downstream of the confluence the average concentrations of cod nh3 n and tp were 38 63 13 66 mg l 1 0 84 0 65 mg l 1 and 0 39 0 07 mg l 1 respectively with a large standard deviation and a wide distribution and the concentration values were between those of yr and fr upstream of the confluence fig 2 contrary to the aforementioned indicators the ph values of the two rivers were relatively consistent not shown in the figure the mds was performed to compare the time averaged cod values at different sites fig 3 the result of mds analysis clearly indicated that four groups could be defined the first group included sites a1 a5 b1 b5 c3 c5 d3 d5 e3 e5 and f3 f5 the samples at these sites were mainly composed of the water inherited from the upstream yr and were characterized by low cod values the second group contained sites e2 f2 g1 and g2 the third group contained sites j1 j5 and k1 k5 these points were located in the fr estuary immediately upstream of the confluence and were characterized by high values of cod the fourth group consisted of c1 c2 d1 d2 e1 and f1 these points were located in the downstream thalweg of the confluence near the tributary and the flow was mainly inherited from the highly polluted water of the fr 3 2 temporal distribution of contaminants the temporal variability of contaminants was studied using the one way anova method and the temporal distribution of each pollutant index was discussed in detail the normality test results appendix b before one way anova showed that the data of each experiment were normally distribution the contaminants essentially displayed significant temporal variability during the experimental period as the p values of every water quality index in anova results were all 0 05 table 2 the significant temporal variability of the contaminants is similar to a recent study on phosphorus pollution of the surface sediment at a confluence in southern china yuan et al 2019 the temporal distributions of cod nh3 n tp and do were respectively analyzed in detail fig 4 the cod displayed a high concentration in early winter r1 and r4 november and october and decreased after winter and the lowest value appeared in spring r7 march afterwards it gradually increased fig 4 a the change of cod with the seasons was mainly related to the discharge of industrial pollutants and the hydrological process of the river the lowest industrial capacity generally occurred in the three months around february owing to the holiday impact of the chinese spring festival on industrial production as a result industrial emissions were at their lowest in january march and were roughly consistent for the rest of the year the minimum value of cod was recorded at the end of march r7 this could be attributed to the decrease in the amount of organic matter discharged into the river from january to march as the total amount of organic matter in the river gradually decreased to the minimum with microbial degradation and the dilution the highest values of cod were found in the early winter r1 and r4 owing to the low discharges of the two confluent rivers during the dry season fig 5 compared with the event r1 the value of cod in the event r4 was higher because the flood 5 before experiment r4 washed up the bottom mud in the fr bed and released high amounts of sedimentary organic matter into the water body fig 5 in addition the large standard deviation revealed the large spatial variability of cod at the confluence fig 4 a nh3 n and tp showed relatively high concentrations in summer r2 august wet season decreased in autumn and winter r3 r6 early october to december and the lowest values appeared in early spring r7 march dry season these values then dramatically increased to larger values later in the spring r8 r9 fig 4 b and c nh3 n and tp concentrations were affected by industrial pollution and agricultural non point source pollution zou et al 2020 wu and ge 2019 yang et al 2013 resembling organic matter the minimal pollution effects in nh3 n and tp by industrial emissions resulted in a gradual decrease in the values of nh3 n and tp from january to march however from march to august residual nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer in the discharge of agricultural irrigation in northern china significantly impacted the water quality in the confluent rivers zou et al 2020 leading to conspicuous increases in nh3 n and tp after march notably in the measurement events of r4 and r5 the tp at the confluence unexpectedly increased while the nh3 n increased slightly fig 4 b and c this could be attributed to the relatively long period of flood 5 in fr which scoured the bottom mud of the bed known as bottom tearing scouring and caused a sedimentary phosphorus resuspension in the flow of the fr fig 5 this bottom tearing scouring phenomenon has occurred 13 times since 1950 near the confluence of yr and fr in the middle reaches of the yr basin li et al 2017 phosphorus is a depositional circulating pollutant while nitrogen is a transformational pollutant heidenreich and kleeberg 2003 li and huang 2010 therefore phosphorus in the surface sediment inevitably released back into the water during the bottom tearing scouring however nh3 n may undergo a series of transformation reactions in the sediment so it may not necessarily be released in the form of nh3 n this specific transformation process needs to be studied further the distribution of do fig 4 d was low in spring r7 r9 march to may and summer r2 august and high in winter r1 r5 r6 november to january this was mainly related to the water temperature t and cod because the saturated dissolved oxygen increased with the decrease of t the higher do was observed in winter in addition when the cod increased it often corresponded to the decrease of do because of the microbial degradation of organic matter such as in r7 r9 3 3 spatial distribution and mixing pattern of substances the junction of yr and fr is a wide shallow confluence the average depths of the yr and fr are 1 03 m and 1 43 m respectively with large width depth ratios of 78 155 and 42 70 respectively zhang et al 2020a stallard 1987 considered that a river confluence in the depth direction was acceptable so they assume that the two rivers were probably already completely mixed over the flow depth therefore the pollutants in this study were essentially considered uniform in a vertical direction and only the transverse and longitudinal two dimensional 2d spatial distribution and mixing patterns were studied fig 6 to more comprehensively understand the 2d distribution and mixing pattern and to match the authors recent study on hydrodynamic and topographic conditions at the confluence zhang et al 2020a the experiments r1 november 27 2016 r2 august 5 2017 and r7 march 31 2018 were selected for this section in general the spatial distributions and mixing patterns of the three pollutants were approximately identical in each specific measurement event fig 6 because of a limited length the cod was selected as a tracer to illustrate the pattern as follows in the r1 measurement event qr 0 10 fig 6 a there was a large difference in cod between the two confluent rivers immediately upstream of the confluence with a high value for fr 72 mg l 1 and a low value for yr 28 mg l 1 the two convergent flows containing organic matter began to mix at the upstream junction corner within the stagnation zones cross sections k and b the values of cod of the two rivers were weakly exchanged upstream indicating that the upstream diffusion of the substances may have existed in the flow with a large difference in concentration this phenomenon is similar to the upstream directed density current at a hyperconcentrated confluence in the upper reach of yr where the tributaries with hyperconcentrated sediment join the low sediment main stream resulting in sediment accumulation in the upstream of the main channel zhang et al 2015 with the advection of fr current the high concentration of organic matters developed downstream along the left bank of the channel gradually occupied less than half of the channel width and formed a narrow and long pollutant belt in the downstream confluence the quasi interface located near the tributary side formed a relatively large gradient of concentration although a distinct interface of water color can be observed in the photos of the field scene fig 1 d there was no obvious cod mixed interface which may be due to the fact that the pollutants with the high concentration difference were mixed through the flow advection and turbulence near the shear layer up to the farthest measured section cross section g the contaminants were still not fully mixed this is consistent with previous studies which concluded that complete mixing at a large confluence generally required tens to hundreds of channel widths rathbun and rostad 2004 parsons et al 2007 bouchez et al 2010 umar et al 2018 in experiment r2 qr 3 22 fig 6 b there was not as much of a difference in concentration at the upstream area of the confluence as in r1 the cod in the fr estuary was relatively low 36 mg l 1 which was only 1 3 times higher than that at the entrance of the yr owing to its large discharge the fr had a large momentum flux and penetrated to the middle of the channel zhang et al 2020a which caused rapid mixing of the pollutants and the formation of a large diffusion area immediately downstream of the confluence at cross section g the contaminants essentially reached complete mixing in event r3 qr 0 06 fig 6 c the cod presented a significant difference between the two confluent rivers average concentrations codyr 17 49 mg l 1 codfr 58 68 mg l 1 however a strong mixing occurred at the fr estuary and the lateral concentration gradient of pollutants was small in the immediate downstream of the confluence this result can be attributed to the dual influence of the confluence s special hydrological condition qfr 5 92 m3 s 1 table 1 and the discordant bed deeper fr which causes the yr to flow backward into the fr estuary thus this dynamic enhanced mixing and turbulence at the mouth of the fr zhang et al 2020a previous studies have also confirmed that the discordant bed is beneficial to rapid mixing at the confluence gaudet and roy 1995 de serres et al 1999 biron et al 2004 additionally the diminutive discharge of fr is not enough to induce a strong change in the water quality within the downstream confluence hence the downstream section cross section g away from the confluence center was fully mixed which was similar to other results in small natural confluences or flume junctions that can facilitate thorough mixing over short distances lewis and rhoads 2015 chen et al 2019 in general the highly polluted fr joined the yr which induced a complex distribution and mixing pattern of the contaminants key factors for the mixing rate may include the inflow hydrological conditions discharge ratio or momentum flux ratio and the pollutant concentrations 3 4 mixing rates at the confluence with the convergence advection and turbulent diffusion of the flows to the downstream the pollutants were gradually mixed and the lateral differences in concentration were gradually decreased the experiments r1 11 27 2016 r5 11 25 2017 and r6 12 20 2017 which had similar concentration ratios cr and significantly different discharge ratios qr were selected to investigate the influence of qr on the mixing rates table 3 fig 7 a fig 8 a the experiments r4 11 24 2017 r6 12 20 2017 and r9 5 10 2018 with approximated discharge ratios and different concentration ratios were selected as representatives to reveal the effect of inflow concentration on mixing table 3 fig 7 b fig 8 b within the center of the confluence the large standard deviations reflected the highly lateral differences of cod with values of 20 17 mg l 1 18 86 mg l 1 and 16 35 mg l 1 for experiments r1 r5 and r6 respectively r1 s value was especially high qr 0 10 fig 7 a this was related to the high concentration of fr and different value for each event table 3 however mixing was enhanced for the high discharge ratio qr 0 10 with a minimum standard deviation for a distance of approximately 27 channel widths and the standard deviation was reduced by 75 from 20 17 to 5 02 however these deviations were only reduced by 53 qr 0 04 and 64 qr 0 07 at low discharge ratios the decrease rate of the standard deviation at a high discharge ratio was faster than that at a low discharge ratio with slope values of 0 51 mg l 1 0 37 mg l 1 and 0 35 mg l 1 for qr 0 10 0 07 and 0 04 respectively additionally there was a strong linear relationship between standard deviation and distance similarly the difference of inflow concentration concentration ratio cr also had a certain influence on the mixing rate the high cr corresponded to the large mixing rate and the slope of the standard deviation and distance were 0 41 mg l 1 cr 3 07 0 37 mg l 1 cr 2 49 and 0 25 mg l 1 cr 2 21 the mixing rates within and immediately downstream of the confluence cross sections c e which had lower standard deviation values than the linear relation function were generally greater than in the channel further downstream fig 7 a and b the mixing rate was enhanced by a stronger turbulence in the adjacent confluence but the region of its effect was small being usually limited to 6 channel widths the deviation from complete mixing Œ¥ also decreased gradually along with the downstream advection of the flows fig 8 in the initial mixing cross section c non dimensional distance 0 the maximum value of Œ¥ was always much greater than 100 Œ¥ max 173 58 which corresponded to the flow located near the left bank and was inherited from fr with a concentration approximately twice that predicted by complete mixing the Œ¥ min was closer to 10 which was close to the fully mixed concentration and corresponded to the flow from the yr gaudet and roy 1995 defined complete mixing as deviation values that were less than 10 in this study mixing was still not complete and the Œ¥ max was greater than 10 after a distance of approximately 27 river widths in the event with the fastest mixing rate qr 0 10 the Œ¥ max of the farthest cross section g was greater than 27 11 fig 8 a however the mixing rate of the confluence of yr and fr with the discordant bed where the standard deviation œÉ was reduced by 50 to 75 over the length of 27 channel widths fig 7 was faster than that of the large confluence with the concordant bed which usually requires hundreds of river widths for comprehensive mixing rathbun and rostad 2004 lane et al 2008 laraque et al 2009 this exception may be attributed to the discordant bed and the complex channel configuration at the confluence for the discordant bed laboratory work best and roy 1991 biron et al 1996a 1996b fieldwork gaudet and roy 1995 de serres et al 1999 and numerical simulations biron et al 2004 have confirmed that a discordant bed can enhance mixing at the confluences the enhanced mixing at the discordant confluence has been attributed to both the cross stream pressure gradient which is related to the velocity and discharge ratio and the vertical extent of this pressure gradient which is controlled by the depth difference bradbrook et al 1998 for the complex channel configuration the authors recent study on geomorphology at the confluence of the yr and fr presented a significant complex and easily changed channel configuration with a scour hole scour belt and sand bars within the confluence zhang et al 2020a lewis and rhoads 2015 demonstrated that topographic effects may alter the flow geometry and thus affect the mixing process as previously mentioned qr and cr significantly affected the mixing rate at the confluence and the mixing process was enhanced with the increase of the qr and cr the influence of qr was mainly attributed to a dynamic where a large momentum of the tributary could penetrate to a location farther away from the tributary at a large discharge ratio and thus enhanced the shear motion turbulent level and the material exchange which were conducive to the development of mixing at the confluence this was consistent with the results of previous studies on the influence of variable inflow conditions on the mixing rate at the confluence these indicated that the mixing rate was closely related to the momentum flux or discharge ratio and the mixing was enhanced with increases of the momentum ratio or discharge ratio rutherford 1994 lewis and rhoads 2015 the influence of cr on the mixing rate may be because the molecular diffusion is dependent of the gradient concentration and the larger the cr is the faster the molecular diffusion is additionally a coincident conclusion was confirmed at a small open channel confluence in the laboratory by the authors chen et al 2019 3 5 controlling factors for mixing to determine the possible relationships between the spatial change in substances mixing within the chz and the potential controlling factors of mixing the change in œÉ xn Œ¥œÉ xn 1 œÉ xn table 4 was plotted versus qr fig 9 a and b and cr fig 9 c Œ¥œÉ xn generally increased with an increase in qr fig 9 a except for two special points of cases r2 8 5 2017 and r7 3 31 2018 fig 9 b these two points showed fortuitous flow conditions of the confluence with a large discharge ratio r2 qr 3 22 qfr 110 46 m3 s 1 and an extremely low discharge of tributary fr r7 qr 0 06 qfr 5 92 m3 s 1 table 1 the unexpectedly large qr was an event of minimal probability during this monitoring event the yr flowed into the fr through a canal which was formed by the collapse of the dike of a small diversion canal located 5 km upstream of the study region during flood 1 fig 5 the large discharge flow of the fr penetrated into nearly the entire channel of the confluence which enhanced the mixing zhang et al 2020a however an extremely low discharge in fr such as in r7 may appear in the dry or irrigation season from march to april according to the discharge record of the fr fig 5 in this hydrological condition the yr backflows eastward to the mouth of the fr because of the low bed of the fr producing strong shearing action and mixing at the mouth zhang et al 2020a therefore these two particular cases correspond to the high values of Œ¥œÉ xn excluding these two points from consideration a strong linear relationship correlation coefficient 0 96 r2 0 90 is shown between Œ¥œÉ xn and qr within the scope of the data with a slope of 1 91 fig 9 a similarly the weak linear relationship correlation coefficient 0 57 r2 0 21 between Œ¥œÉ xn and cr indicated that the Œ¥œÉ xn overall increased with the increase of the cr except for a specific point r2 and the slope was 0 15 fig 9 c in comparing the correlation coefficients of qr and cr over Œ¥œÉ xn the effect of qr was more important than the role of cr in determining the mixing level at the confluence the qr undoubtedly affected the flow structure at the confluence thus controlling the development of mixing in contrast the cr could potentially only affect the molecular diffusion rate coefficient and so it played an auxiliary role in the mixing process although the correlation between the discharge ratio and concentration ratio was not considered in this study the inflow concentration was determined by the water quality of the upstream flow rather than the discharge therefore these two variables were independent of each other in addition the influence of variable topographic on mixing was not considered because of the limited data however for such a large confluence with a relatively high mixing level in a short distance the discordant bed greatly enhanced the mixing rate which in accordance with previous studies on discordant confluences best and roy 1991 gaudet and roy 1995 biron et al 1996a 1996b 2004 de serres et al 1999 4 conclusion the present study detailed the complex spatiotemporal distribution of typical contaminants as well as the patterns rates and controlling factors of mixing at a large asymmetric confluence in northern china this confluence contained characteristics of wide shallow channels large differences in discharge a discordant bed and a severely polluted tributary the results are exceedingly important in understanding the distribution of pollutants and mixing dynamics at confluences of this type the important conclusions obtained from the field data are illustrated as follows i the heavily contaminated tributary joining the main channel seriously affected the water quality of the confluence especially in the downstream channel near the tributary these quality parameters included cod nh3 n tp and do ii the concentrations of pollutants at the confluence of yr and fr presented a significant seasonal variability cod was recorded greatest impact in early winter while nh3 n and tp increased in spring the change in cod was consistent with that of do and the variations of tp and nh3 n expressed similar characteristics strong flooding events can increase the concentration of pollutants owing to the bottom tearing scouring of the channel upstream of the confluence especially for total phosphorus iii the spatial distributions and mixing patterns of several pollutants had approximately the same features which mainly manifested as a narrow long belt of high concentration pollution located in the downstream channel near the tributary there was no obvious mixing interface which was possibly caused by the flow advection and turbulence near the shear layer the hydrological conditions of the inflow had a strong influence on the spatial distribution and mixing pattern with the fortuitous and unexpected condition of a large discharge ratio the high concentration of pollutants quickly occupied almost the entire downstream channel of the confluence however when the tributary discharge was extremely small the high concentration of pollutants only appeared in the tributary estuaries iv the mixing rate was positively correlated with the discharge ratio and concentration ratio the discharge ratio was the key factor in controlling the mixing rate and mixing metric because of the high correlation between the discharge ratio and the mixing metric qr affected the flow structure at the confluence and thus controlled the development of mixing v the large asymmetrical confluence with a discordant bed a lower bed of the tributary presented relatively rapid mixing compared with large confluences with concordant beds especially with the condition of an extremely low discharge of the tributary strong mixing occurred at the mouth of a tributary which induced full mixing in a short distance the conclusions of this study are of great significance for understanding the degree of contamination spatiotemporal distribution and mixing dynamics of characteristic pollutants at complex river confluences however the process of material transport and mixing caused by the complex and changeable topographic configuration at the confluence deserves further study it is worth to reveal the mechanism of topography affecting flow structure and resulting in material transport and mixing credit authorship

5128,previous studies of confluences have mainly concentrated on their hydrodynamic characteristics and morphological dynamics however the increasing environmental pollution in rivers has resulted in abrupt variations in water quality at confluences thus affecting the ecosystems in river networks therefore more attention should be paid to the pollutant distribution and mixing processes at confluences in this study several field experiments on pollutant concentrations were conducted at a large asymmetric confluence with a discordant bed and wide shallow channel in northern china where a heavily polluted tributary known as the fen river joins the yellow river the results displayed that the heavily polluted tributary seriously affected the water quality at the confluence especially in the downstream channel near the tributary the contaminations at the confluence present a relatively strong temporal variability the organic matter and dissolved oxygen show a similar seasonal variability with each other whereas ammonia nitrogen and total phosphorus are also similar to each other but they have a different variability from the first group these pollutants mostly demonstrated the same spatial distribution characteristics with large horizontal concentration differences at the confluence the standard deviation of the cross sectional concentration gradually decreased with the downstream mixing of contaminants nonetheless under conventional hydrological conditions these contaminants were not completely mixed through a length of 27 river widths compared with a concordant bed this discordant confluence exhibited a relatively fast mixing rate the key factor affecting the mixing process at the confluence was the discharge ratio exceptionally during the irrigation period march april owing to the extremely low discharge of the tributary the main stream flowed backward into the tributary which enhanced the mixing motion to constitute an approximately full mixing regime at the mouth of the tributary these results are of great importance in understanding the degree of contamination spatiotemporal distribution and mixing dynamics of characteristic pollutants at complex

their hydrodynamic characteristics sediment transport and bed morphology and consistent conclusions have been yielded from a laboratory setting mosley 1976 best and reid 1984 best 1987 fieldwork ashmore et al 1992 biron et al 1993 de serres et al 1999 rhoads and sukhodolov 2008 and numerical simulations bradbrook et al 2000 2001 biron et al 2004 the complex flow structure at the confluence hydrodynamic zone chz shows obvious three dimensional characteristics and consists of flow stagnation deflection separation acceleration and recovery zones as well as a shear layer mixing interface best 1987 in addition the helical motion is also the main factor governing mixing and bed erosion at the confluence however the helical motion does not necessarily occur at the large and wide confluence with a width depth ratio greater than 100 parsons et al 2007 zhang et al 2020a and the flow separation is not persistent at the confluence with a relatively smooth junction corner roy et al 1988 roy and bergeron 1990 ashmore et al 1992 rhoads and sukhodolov 2001 the typical features of bed morphology are mainly composed of a scour hole avalanche faces sedimentation in the stagnation zone and bars located in the separation zone as well as the center of the downstream channel best 1987 1988 leite ribeiro et al 2012 guill√©n lude√±a et al 2015 yuan et al 2018 the key factors that control and influence the flow structure and bed morphology of the confluence include the plane symmetry junction angle momentum flux ratio and bed concordance rhoads and johnson 2018 however the distribution characteristics and mixing dynamics of contaminants at the confluence require further study for example a recent study had found that many emerging pollutants at the confluence pose a threat to the water security of the junction mijangos et al 2018 of course sediment nutrients and water nutrients are the major environmental factors at a confluence such as organic matter om nitrogen n and phosphorus p since these factors have important effects on the community structure and growth metabolism of aquatic organisms campodonico et al 2015 xu et al 2018 li et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b moreover significant alterations in n and p can cause water eutrophication gireeshkumar et al 2013 allison et al 2014 phosphorus pollution in the surface sediment of a confluence contains a significant spatiotemporal variation and special dynamic characteristics and the p contamination is more severe than that of the downstream reach additionally the flooding process dissolved oxygen do and water temperature are the main factors affecting a p contamination allison et al 2014 yuan et al 2019 therefore an abrupt change of water quality at a confluence may cause serious harm to its downstream water environment and drinking water safety at present there are relatively few studies on the contamination level and the spatiotemporal distribution of typical pollutants such as organic matter ammonia nitrogen and total phosphorus at confluences and these unclear contamination characteristics deserve further study mixing within and downstream of confluences is usually evaluated using conserved substances in water as tracers including temperature conductivity ph and stable oxygen isotopes gaudet and roy 1995 rhoads and kenworthy 1995 1998 kabeya et al 2008 previous studies have suggested that lateral mixing at large confluences is a slow process and the distance for complete mixing often requires hundreds of channel widths rathbun and rostad 2004 lane et al 2008 laraque et al 2009 bouchez et al 2010 however the mixing rates of small confluences are relatively fast and sufficient mixing can occur within a short distance adjacent to the confluence gaudet and roy 1995 rhoads and kenworthy 1995 rhoads and sukhodolov 2001 biron et al 2004 the mixing rate and distance are often related to the discharge ratio momentum flux ratio density difference cross sectional area and bed height difference at the confluence lewis and rhoads 2015 indicated that an increase in the momentum flux ratio could accelerate the mixing rate at a small confluence additionally the cross sectional area was negatively correlated with the mixing rate and the density difference would cause a buoyancy effect that influenced the mixing rate compared with a concordant bed enhanced mixing at a discordant confluence has been attributed to a distortion in the mixing layer gaudet and roy 1995 de serres et al 1999 biron et al 2004 the extent to which these findings can be generalized to large asymmetric confluences with complex configurations such as wide shallow channels large differences in discharge and discordant beds remains poorly understood moreover the tracers in previous studies may not completely represent the actual mixing processes of pollutants in the water additional studies are needed to more comprehensively understand the mixing dynamics at these complex confluences the present study investigates the spatiotemporal distribution and mixing dynamics of typical environmental pollutants at a complex river confluence the hydrodynamic data and characteristic environmental pollutant organic matter ammonia nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations were monitored for several times in field at the confluence of the yellow river and fen river in northern china this confluence is large and asymmetric with wide shallow channels large differences in discharge a discordant bed and a severely polluted tributary that seriously affects the confluence s water quality using the field data for a series of variable hydrological conditions this study illustrates the contamination characteristics and spatiotemporal distribution of the pollutants at the confluence investigates the mixing pattern and rate and reveals the key factors controlling the mixing process the results of this study are helpful in understanding the spatiotemporal distribution and the mixing dynamic of typical environmental pollutants at natural large asymmetric confluences with discordant bed and large differences in discharge 2 experiments and analysis 2 1 study region the yellow river yr is the second largest river in china and the fifth largest in the world which originates in the sanjiangyuan region of qinghai province and flows eastward into the bohai sea fig 1 a the yr is affectionately known as the mother river because it provides drinking water sources for approximately 114 million people and irrigates 110 000 acres of farmland every day bai et al 2015 additionally the water quality of the yr has historically been relatively good since 1998 the water body of the yr basin has become gradually polluted and the water environment has deteriorated zhao et al 2020 this is especially noticeable at some confluences where seriously polluted tributaries join the yr and is a consequence of the development of industry agriculture and the social economy zhao et al 2020 one prominent example includes the confluence of the yellow river and fen river which is located in the middle reaches of the yellow river fen river fr the second largest tributary of the yellow river is located in shanxi province which has a semi arid climate in past decades the runoff of the fr has continued to decline because of the impacts of climate and anthropogenic perturbations liang et al 2015 in addition shanxi province has a coal reserve accounting for one fourth of china s total coal resources the water quality in the fr basin has seriously damaged by the agricultural non point source pollution anpsp and the point source pollution psp the psp is mainly caused by excessive exploitation and synthesized utilization of coal in shanxi province yang et al 2018 recent research demonstrated that the concentrations of total nitrogen ammonia nitrogen nitrite nitrogen total organic carbon and coliform in the fr greatly exceeded the national criteria zhao et al 2020 the color of water body in fr is black and there is a distinct color difference interface at the confluence of the fr and the yr in this study the confluence of the yr and fr located in miaoqian village wanrong county shanxi province in northern china was selected for field experiments fig 1 the drainage area of the yr upstream of the confluence is 497 600 km2 and that of the fr is 38 700 km2 the average discharge of the yr and fr was 586 1 m3 s 1 and 30 2 m3 s 1 between september 2016 and september 2018 respectively the average discharge ratio between the fr and the yr is 0 06 the upstream land cover consists mainly of agricultural land and china s loess plateau the confluence of the yr and the fr is a large asymmetric confluence with a 41 geometric angle between the two confluent flows a recent study by the authors demonstrated that the confluence was characterized by complex channel configuration and hydrodynamic characteristics zhang et al 2020a the geomorphologic features of the channel bed are composed of a beach at the upstream junction corner a small scour hole and a long narrow scour belt located at the immediate downstream of the confluence and a bed discordance with a depth difference of 2 m between the two confluent channels the tributary bed below to the main stream fig 1 b the flow field structure is mainly divided into flow stagnation zone deflection zone shear layer mixing interface and recovery area however there is no obvious flow separation area and helical motion fig 1 c to understand the spatial temporal distribution characteristics and mixing dynamics of typical contaminants at the confluence of yr and fr nine monitoring sections and forty five water sampling sites were defined within an area of 707 470 m2 for the field experiments fig 1 b among them two sections were respectively arranged in reaches of the yr sections a and b and fr sections j and k upstream of the confluence and five sections of c g were set up within and downstream of the confluence five water sampling sites were arranged in each section which were successively named a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 etc from the left bank to the right bank of the channel 2 2 sampling and analysis we conducted nine sampling monitoring tests r1 r9 at the confluence from november 27 2016 to may 10 2018 table 1 in each measurement event forty five water samples were collected at the confluence by a handheld plexiglass surface water sampler size œÜ 150 mm h 200 mm volume 3 5 l during sampling workers arrived at the monitoring point by a boat and collected water samples at 0 5 m below the surface with the plexiglass sampler each sample was divided into two parts one part was used for on site measurements of dissolved oxygen do and ph and the other part was quickly transferred to a 500 ml polyethylene bottle stored in a 4 incubator and brought back to the laboratory for chemical oxygen demand cod as an indicator of organic matter in water ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and total phosphorus tp testing do and ph were measured by an orion startm a326 portable ph rdo do meter relative accuracy 0 2 mg l 1 and 0 002 for do and ph respectively cod nh3 n and tp were analyzed according to the potassium dichromate method nessler s reagents spectrophotometer method and the ultraviolet spectrophotometric method uv 2450 shimadzu respectively the methods were all based on the water and wastewater monitoring and analysis methods mepprc 2002 water levels channel widths topography discharges and three dimensional velocities were additionally measured in experiment r1 november 27 2016 r2 august 5 2017 and r7 mar 31 2018 and the details referred to the author s recent research zhang et al 2020a the mean depth of yr at immediately upstream channel of confluence is 1 03 m and that of fr is 1 43 m the average depth of downstream confluence is 1 78 m discharges in other experiments were obtained from the official website of the yellow river conservancy commission 2 3 data analysis to understand the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of typical pollutants at the confluence post processing analysis of the concentration data was performed using one way analysis of variance anova and multidimensional scaling mds in the statistical package for social sciences spss version 17 0 the one way anova test was mainly used to examine the spatiotemporal variability of pollutant concentrations the mds was used to compare and establish the relationships between the characteristics of samples yuan et al 2019 the substances spatial distribution was drawn using the software package mike zero 2014 with a method that interpolates the substance concentrations at each grid node 2 4 mixing rates and metric to evaluate the mixing process and rate at the confluence the standard deviation œÉ was calculated for substances concentrations in each monitoring section the standard deviation can be used to measure the variance of pollutant concentration in each cross section biron et al 2004 along the direction of flow the œÉ of a given section will gradually decrease the slope of œÉ versus longitudinal distance can reflect the mixing rate although substances are degraded and transformed by microorganisms in the water while moving downstream with the water flow the change in concentration resulted from degradation and transformation can be ignored in such a small measurement area the distance between the cross section c and cross section g was merely 1212 4 m wang et al 2012 pointed out that the cod and nh3 n degradation coefficients from longmen to tongguan section of the yellow river including the study area were 0 29 day and 0 17 day respectively after calculation the microbial degradation amounts of cod and nh3 n within the study region are only 0 4 and 0 3 respectively therefore the influence of microbial degradation on substance concentrations is not considered temporarily in this study deviation from complete mixing Œ¥ for the concentration of pollutants at each sampling site is defined as follows 1 Œ¥ i c i c p c p 100 where ci is the concentration of pollutants at each site and cp is the predicted concentration after complete mixing gaudet and roy 1995 the predicted concentration cp is calculated as follows 2 c p c 1 q 1 c 2 q 2 q 1 q 2 where c is the pollutant concentration q is discharge and the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the tributary and main stream respectively to further understand the mixing level in different confluent and incoming conditions at the confluence a quantified mixing metric based on the standard deviation was computed for a synthesis upstream section and for the farthest downstream section g lewis and rhoads 2015 this synthesis upstream section consisted of the concentration data of two confluent flows sections cross section a for yr cross section j for fr which was interpreted as the cross section of the exact location where the two flows met the average concentrations of the two upstream cross sections cross section a and j were used to obtain the standard deviation in concentration œÉ us for incoming flows when no mixing had occurred the normalized mixing metric œÉ xn is computed as follows 3 œÉ xn œÉ g œÉ us where the subscript xn represents each specific experiment œÉ g is the standard deviation of cross section g completely mixed conditions at cross section g correspond to œÉ g 0 in these cases œÉ xn also equals 0 therefore the normalized metric defines the fraction of mixing downstream of the initial flow convergence over the interval of 0 to 1 ranging from no mixing 1 to fully mixed conditions 0 the normalized mixing metric is comparable between dates with different incoming flow conditions and contaminant concentrations to determine the possible relationships between the spatial change in substances mixing within the chz and the potential controlling factors of mixing the change in œÉ xn Œ¥œÉ xn was defined as follows lewis and rhoads 2015 4 Œ¥ œÉ xn 1 œÉ xn where the Œ¥œÉ xn represents the change in œÉ xn within the chz the greater the Œ¥œÉ xn the stronger mixing presents at the confluence Œ¥œÉ xn 1 correspond to fully mixing at the cross section g 3 results and discussion 3 1 contaminations at the confluence in the yr reach immediately upstream of the confluence the low values of cod nh3 n and tp mean values of 27 37 0 86 mg l 1 0 41 0 08 mg l 1 and 0 34 0 02 mg l 1 respectively indicated that the yr had a relatively good water quality fig 2 however the cod nh3 n and tp concentrations at the mouth of fr were relatively high with average values of 69 98 1 95 mg l 1 2 63 1 14 mg l 1 and 0 57 0 09 mg l 1 respectively fig 2 these results are attributed to the serious pollution from the upper reaches of the basin obviously the small standard deviations of the concentrations indicated that the water quality in the section was more uniform before the convergence of the two streams in comparison the organic pollution ammonia nitrogen pollution and phosphorus pollution of fr were 2 6 times 6 4 times and 1 7 times higher than that of the yr respectively similarly there were some differences in do between the two confluent rivers and were mainly reflected in the low do value in fr and the high do value in yr not shown in the figure these differences can be ascribed to the larger pollutant concentration in fr substances in fr along with the flow penetrated the yr which seriously damaged the water quality at the confluence within and downstream of the confluence the average concentrations of cod nh3 n and tp were 38 63 13 66 mg l 1 0 84 0 65 mg l 1 and 0 39 0 07 mg l 1 respectively with a large standard deviation and a wide distribution and the concentration values were between those of yr and fr upstream of the confluence fig 2 contrary to the aforementioned indicators the ph values of the two rivers were relatively consistent not shown in the figure the mds was performed to compare the time averaged cod values at different sites fig 3 the result of mds analysis clearly indicated that four groups could be defined the first group included sites a1 a5 b1 b5 c3 c5 d3 d5 e3 e5 and f3 f5 the samples at these sites were mainly composed of the water inherited from the upstream yr and were characterized by low cod values the second group contained sites e2 f2 g1 and g2 the third group contained sites j1 j5 and k1 k5 these points were located in the fr estuary immediately upstream of the confluence and were characterized by high values of cod the fourth group consisted of c1 c2 d1 d2 e1 and f1 these points were located in the downstream thalweg of the confluence near the tributary and the flow was mainly inherited from the highly polluted water of the fr 3 2 temporal distribution of contaminants the temporal variability of contaminants was studied using the one way anova method and the temporal distribution of each pollutant index was discussed in detail the normality test results appendix b before one way anova showed that the data of each experiment were normally distribution the contaminants essentially displayed significant temporal variability during the experimental period as the p values of every water quality index in anova results were all 0 05 table 2 the significant temporal variability of the contaminants is similar to a recent study on phosphorus pollution of the surface sediment at a confluence in southern china yuan et al 2019 the temporal distributions of cod nh3 n tp and do were respectively analyzed in detail fig 4 the cod displayed a high concentration in early winter r1 and r4 november and october and decreased after winter and the lowest value appeared in spring r7 march afterwards it gradually increased fig 4 a the change of cod with the seasons was mainly related to the discharge of industrial pollutants and the hydrological process of the river the lowest industrial capacity generally occurred in the three months around february owing to the holiday impact of the chinese spring festival on industrial production as a result industrial emissions were at their lowest in january march and were roughly consistent for the rest of the year the minimum value of cod was recorded at the end of march r7 this could be attributed to the decrease in the amount of organic matter discharged into the river from january to march as the total amount of organic matter in the river gradually decreased to the minimum with microbial degradation and the dilution the highest values of cod were found in the early winter r1 and r4 owing to the low discharges of the two confluent rivers during the dry season fig 5 compared with the event r1 the value of cod in the event r4 was higher because the flood 5 before experiment r4 washed up the bottom mud in the fr bed and released high amounts of sedimentary organic matter into the water body fig 5 in addition the large standard deviation revealed the large spatial variability of cod at the confluence fig 4 a nh3 n and tp showed relatively high concentrations in summer r2 august wet season decreased in autumn and winter r3 r6 early october to december and the lowest values appeared in early spring r7 march dry season these values then dramatically increased to larger values later in the spring r8 r9 fig 4 b and c nh3 n and tp concentrations were affected by industrial pollution and agricultural non point source pollution zou et al 2020 wu and ge 2019 yang et al 2013 resembling organic matter the minimal pollution effects in nh3 n and tp by industrial emissions resulted in a gradual decrease in the values of nh3 n and tp from january to march however from march to august residual nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer in the discharge of agricultural irrigation in northern china significantly impacted the water quality in the confluent rivers zou et al 2020 leading to conspicuous increases in nh3 n and tp after march notably in the measurement events of r4 and r5 the tp at the confluence unexpectedly increased while the nh3 n increased slightly fig 4 b and c this could be attributed to the relatively long period of flood 5 in fr which scoured the bottom mud of the bed known as bottom tearing scouring and caused a sedimentary phosphorus resuspension in the flow of the fr fig 5 this bottom tearing scouring phenomenon has occurred 13 times since 1950 near the confluence of yr and fr in the middle reaches of the yr basin li et al 2017 phosphorus is a depositional circulating pollutant while nitrogen is a transformational pollutant heidenreich and kleeberg 2003 li and huang 2010 therefore phosphorus in the surface sediment inevitably released back into the water during the bottom tearing scouring however nh3 n may undergo a series of transformation reactions in the sediment so it may not necessarily be released in the form of nh3 n this specific transformation process needs to be studied further the distribution of do fig 4 d was low in spring r7 r9 march to may and summer r2 august and high in winter r1 r5 r6 november to january this was mainly related to the water temperature t and cod because the saturated dissolved oxygen increased with the decrease of t the higher do was observed in winter in addition when the cod increased it often corresponded to the decrease of do because of the microbial degradation of organic matter such as in r7 r9 3 3 spatial distribution and mixing pattern of substances the junction of yr and fr is a wide shallow confluence the average depths of the yr and fr are 1 03 m and 1 43 m respectively with large width depth ratios of 78 155 and 42 70 respectively zhang et al 2020a stallard 1987 considered that a river confluence in the depth direction was acceptable so they assume that the two rivers were probably already completely mixed over the flow depth therefore the pollutants in this study were essentially considered uniform in a vertical direction and only the transverse and longitudinal two dimensional 2d spatial distribution and mixing patterns were studied fig 6 to more comprehensively understand the 2d distribution and mixing pattern and to match the authors recent study on hydrodynamic and topographic conditions at the confluence zhang et al 2020a the experiments r1 november 27 2016 r2 august 5 2017 and r7 march 31 2018 were selected for this section in general the spatial distributions and mixing patterns of the three pollutants were approximately identical in each specific measurement event fig 6 because of a limited length the cod was selected as a tracer to illustrate the pattern as follows in the r1 measurement event qr 0 10 fig 6 a there was a large difference in cod between the two confluent rivers immediately upstream of the confluence with a high value for fr 72 mg l 1 and a low value for yr 28 mg l 1 the two convergent flows containing organic matter began to mix at the upstream junction corner within the stagnation zones cross sections k and b the values of cod of the two rivers were weakly exchanged upstream indicating that the upstream diffusion of the substances may have existed in the flow with a large difference in concentration this phenomenon is similar to the upstream directed density current at a hyperconcentrated confluence in the upper reach of yr where the tributaries with hyperconcentrated sediment join the low sediment main stream resulting in sediment accumulation in the upstream of the main channel zhang et al 2015 with the advection of fr current the high concentration of organic matters developed downstream along the left bank of the channel gradually occupied less than half of the channel width and formed a narrow and long pollutant belt in the downstream confluence the quasi interface located near the tributary side formed a relatively large gradient of concentration although a distinct interface of water color can be observed in the photos of the field scene fig 1 d there was no obvious cod mixed interface which may be due to the fact that the pollutants with the high concentration difference were mixed through the flow advection and turbulence near the shear layer up to the farthest measured section cross section g the contaminants were still not fully mixed this is consistent with previous studies which concluded that complete mixing at a large confluence generally required tens to hundreds of channel widths rathbun and rostad 2004 parsons et al 2007 bouchez et al 2010 umar et al 2018 in experiment r2 qr 3 22 fig 6 b there was not as much of a difference in concentration at the upstream area of the confluence as in r1 the cod in the fr estuary was relatively low 36 mg l 1 which was only 1 3 times higher than that at the entrance of the yr owing to its large discharge the fr had a large momentum flux and penetrated to the middle of the channel zhang et al 2020a which caused rapid mixing of the pollutants and the formation of a large diffusion area immediately downstream of the confluence at cross section g the contaminants essentially reached complete mixing in event r3 qr 0 06 fig 6 c the cod presented a significant difference between the two confluent rivers average concentrations codyr 17 49 mg l 1 codfr 58 68 mg l 1 however a strong mixing occurred at the fr estuary and the lateral concentration gradient of pollutants was small in the immediate downstream of the confluence this result can be attributed to the dual influence of the confluence s special hydrological condition qfr 5 92 m3 s 1 table 1 and the discordant bed deeper fr which causes the yr to flow backward into the fr estuary thus this dynamic enhanced mixing and turbulence at the mouth of the fr zhang et al 2020a previous studies have also confirmed that the discordant bed is beneficial to rapid mixing at the confluence gaudet and roy 1995 de serres et al 1999 biron et al 2004 additionally the diminutive discharge of fr is not enough to induce a strong change in the water quality within the downstream confluence hence the downstream section cross section g away from the confluence center was fully mixed which was similar to other results in small natural confluences or flume junctions that can facilitate thorough mixing over short distances lewis and rhoads 2015 chen et al 2019 in general the highly polluted fr joined the yr which induced a complex distribution and mixing pattern of the contaminants key factors for the mixing rate may include the inflow hydrological conditions discharge ratio or momentum flux ratio and the pollutant concentrations 3 4 mixing rates at the confluence with the convergence advection and turbulent diffusion of the flows to the downstream the pollutants were gradually mixed and the lateral differences in concentration were gradually decreased the experiments r1 11 27 2016 r5 11 25 2017 and r6 12 20 2017 which had similar concentration ratios cr and significantly different discharge ratios qr were selected to investigate the influence of qr on the mixing rates table 3 fig 7 a fig 8 a the experiments r4 11 24 2017 r6 12 20 2017 and r9 5 10 2018 with approximated discharge ratios and different concentration ratios were selected as representatives to reveal the effect of inflow concentration on mixing table 3 fig 7 b fig 8 b within the center of the confluence the large standard deviations reflected the highly lateral differences of cod with values of 20 17 mg l 1 18 86 mg l 1 and 16 35 mg l 1 for experiments r1 r5 and r6 respectively r1 s value was especially high qr 0 10 fig 7 a this was related to the high concentration of fr and different value for each event table 3 however mixing was enhanced for the high discharge ratio qr 0 10 with a minimum standard deviation for a distance of approximately 27 channel widths and the standard deviation was reduced by 75 from 20 17 to 5 02 however these deviations were only reduced by 53 qr 0 04 and 64 qr 0 07 at low discharge ratios the decrease rate of the standard deviation at a high discharge ratio was faster than that at a low discharge ratio with slope values of 0 51 mg l 1 0 37 mg l 1 and 0 35 mg l 1 for qr 0 10 0 07 and 0 04 respectively additionally there was a strong linear relationship between standard deviation and distance similarly the difference of inflow concentration concentration ratio cr also had a certain influence on the mixing rate the high cr corresponded to the large mixing rate and the slope of the standard deviation and distance were 0 41 mg l 1 cr 3 07 0 37 mg l 1 cr 2 49 and 0 25 mg l 1 cr 2 21 the mixing rates within and immediately downstream of the confluence cross sections c e which had lower standard deviation values than the linear relation function were generally greater than in the channel further downstream fig 7 a and b the mixing rate was enhanced by a stronger turbulence in the adjacent confluence but the region of its effect was small being usually limited to 6 channel widths the deviation from complete mixing Œ¥ also decreased gradually along with the downstream advection of the flows fig 8 in the initial mixing cross section c non dimensional distance 0 the maximum value of Œ¥ was always much greater than 100 Œ¥ max 173 58 which corresponded to the flow located near the left bank and was inherited from fr with a concentration approximately twice that predicted by complete mixing the Œ¥ min was closer to 10 which was close to the fully mixed concentration and corresponded to the flow from the yr gaudet and roy 1995 defined complete mixing as deviation values that were less than 10 in this study mixing was still not complete and the Œ¥ max was greater than 10 after a distance of approximately 27 river widths in the event with the fastest mixing rate qr 0 10 the Œ¥ max of the farthest cross section g was greater than 27 11 fig 8 a however the mixing rate of the confluence of yr and fr with the discordant bed where the standard deviation œÉ was reduced by 50 to 75 over the length of 27 channel widths fig 7 was faster than that of the large confluence with the concordant bed which usually requires hundreds of river widths for comprehensive mixing rathbun and rostad 2004 lane et al 2008 laraque et al 2009 this exception may be attributed to the discordant bed and the complex channel configuration at the confluence for the discordant bed laboratory work best and roy 1991 biron et al 1996a 1996b fieldwork gaudet and roy 1995 de serres et al 1999 and numerical simulations biron et al 2004 have confirmed that a discordant bed can enhance mixing at the confluences the enhanced mixing at the discordant confluence has been attributed to both the cross stream pressure gradient which is related to the velocity and discharge ratio and the vertical extent of this pressure gradient which is controlled by the depth difference bradbrook et al 1998 for the complex channel configuration the authors recent study on geomorphology at the confluence of the yr and fr presented a significant complex and easily changed channel configuration with a scour hole scour belt and sand bars within the confluence zhang et al 2020a lewis and rhoads 2015 demonstrated that topographic effects may alter the flow geometry and thus affect the mixing process as previously mentioned qr and cr significantly affected the mixing rate at the confluence and the mixing process was enhanced with the increase of the qr and cr the influence of qr was mainly attributed to a dynamic where a large momentum of the tributary could penetrate to a location farther away from the tributary at a large discharge ratio and thus enhanced the shear motion turbulent level and the material exchange which were conducive to the development of mixing at the confluence this was consistent with the results of previous studies on the influence of variable inflow conditions on the mixing rate at the confluence these indicated that the mixing rate was closely related to the momentum flux or discharge ratio and the mixing was enhanced with increases of the momentum ratio or discharge ratio rutherford 1994 lewis and rhoads 2015 the influence of cr on the mixing rate may be because the molecular diffusion is dependent of the gradient concentration and the larger the cr is the faster the molecular diffusion is additionally a coincident conclusion was confirmed at a small open channel confluence in the laboratory by the authors chen et al 2019 3 5 controlling factors for mixing to determine the possible relationships between the spatial change in substances mixing within the chz and the potential controlling factors of mixing the change in œÉ xn Œ¥œÉ xn 1 œÉ xn table 4 was plotted versus qr fig 9 a and b and cr fig 9 c Œ¥œÉ xn generally increased with an increase in qr fig 9 a except for two special points of cases r2 8 5 2017 and r7 3 31 2018 fig 9 b these two points showed fortuitous flow conditions of the confluence with a large discharge ratio r2 qr 3 22 qfr 110 46 m3 s 1 and an extremely low discharge of tributary fr r7 qr 0 06 qfr 5 92 m3 s 1 table 1 the unexpectedly large qr was an event of minimal probability during this monitoring event the yr flowed into the fr through a canal which was formed by the collapse of the dike of a small diversion canal located 5 km upstream of the study region during flood 1 fig 5 the large discharge flow of the fr penetrated into nearly the entire channel of the confluence which enhanced the mixing zhang et al 2020a however an extremely low discharge in fr such as in r7 may appear in the dry or irrigation season from march to april according to the discharge record of the fr fig 5 in this hydrological condition the yr backflows eastward to the mouth of the fr because of the low bed of the fr producing strong shearing action and mixing at the mouth zhang et al 2020a therefore these two particular cases correspond to the high values of Œ¥œÉ xn excluding these two points from consideration a strong linear relationship correlation coefficient 0 96 r2 0 90 is shown between Œ¥œÉ xn and qr within the scope of the data with a slope of 1 91 fig 9 a similarly the weak linear relationship correlation coefficient 0 57 r2 0 21 between Œ¥œÉ xn and cr indicated that the Œ¥œÉ xn overall increased with the increase of the cr except for a specific point r2 and the slope was 0 15 fig 9 c in comparing the correlation coefficients of qr and cr over Œ¥œÉ xn the effect of qr was more important than the role of cr in determining the mixing level at the confluence the qr undoubtedly affected the flow structure at the confluence thus controlling the development of mixing in contrast the cr could potentially only affect the molecular diffusion rate coefficient and so it played an auxiliary role in the mixing process although the correlation between the discharge ratio and concentration ratio was not considered in this study the inflow concentration was determined by the water quality of the upstream flow rather than the discharge therefore these two variables were independent of each other in addition the influence of variable topographic on mixing was not considered because of the limited data however for such a large confluence with a relatively high mixing level in a short distance the discordant bed greatly enhanced the mixing rate which in accordance with previous studies on discordant confluences best and roy 1991 gaudet and roy 1995 biron et al 1996a 1996b 2004 de serres et al 1999 4 conclusion the present study detailed the complex spatiotemporal distribution of typical contaminants as well as the patterns rates and controlling factors of mixing at a large asymmetric confluence in northern china this confluence contained characteristics of wide shallow channels large differences in discharge a discordant bed and a severely polluted tributary the results are exceedingly important in understanding the distribution of pollutants and mixing dynamics at confluences of this type the important conclusions obtained from the field data are illustrated as follows i the heavily contaminated tributary joining the main channel seriously affected the water quality of the confluence especially in the downstream channel near the tributary these quality parameters included cod nh3 n tp and do ii the concentrations of pollutants at the confluence of yr and fr presented a significant seasonal variability cod was recorded greatest impact in early winter while nh3 n and tp increased in spring the change in cod was consistent with that of do and the variations of tp and nh3 n expressed similar characteristics strong flooding events can increase the concentration of pollutants owing to the bottom tearing scouring of the channel upstream of the confluence especially for total phosphorus iii the spatial distributions and mixing patterns of several pollutants had approximately the same features which mainly manifested as a narrow long belt of high concentration pollution located in the downstream channel near the tributary there was no obvious mixing interface which was possibly caused by the flow advection and turbulence near the shear layer the hydrological conditions of the inflow had a strong influence on the spatial distribution and mixing pattern with the fortuitous and unexpected condition of a large discharge ratio the high concentration of pollutants quickly occupied almost the entire downstream channel of the confluence however when the tributary discharge was extremely small the high concentration of pollutants only appeared in the tributary estuaries iv the mixing rate was positively correlated with the discharge ratio and concentration ratio the discharge ratio was the key factor in controlling the mixing rate and mixing metric because of the high correlation between the discharge ratio and the mixing metric qr affected the flow structure at the confluence and thus controlled the development of mixing v the large asymmetrical confluence with a discordant bed a lower bed of the tributary presented relatively rapid mixing compared with large confluences with concordant beds especially with the condition of an extremely low discharge of the tributary strong mixing occurred at the mouth of a tributary which induced full mixing in a short distance the conclusions of this study are of great significance for understanding the degree of contamination spatiotemporal distribution and mixing dynamics of characteristic pollutants at complex river confluences however the process of material transport and mixing caused by the complex and changeable topographic configuration at the confluence deserves further study it is worth to reveal the mechanism of topography affecting flow structure and resulting in material transport and mixing credit authorship

5129,many models have been developed in previous studies for predicting the formation of disinfection by products dbps in drinking water however most of them were linear or log linear regression models and generated based on simulated disinfection of source water or treated water in a laboratory other than real tap water which shows low application potential in practice in this study a radial basis function artificial neural network rbf ann as well as the hybrid method of rbf ann and grey relational analysis gra was proposed to predict trihalomethanes thms levels in real distribution systems a total of 64 sets of data including thms levels trichloromethane tcm bromodichloromethane bdcm and total thms t thms and 8 water quality parameters temperature ph uv absorbance at 254 uva254

however disinfectant e g chlorine can react with organic matter om in water producing a variety of disinfection by products dbps including trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas haloacetonitriles hans etc krasner et al 2006 hong et al 2008 2013 ding et al 2013 hur et al 2014 li and mitch 2018 both laboratory studies and epidemiology investigations showed that long term exposure to dbps could increase the risk of cancer and birth defects richardson et al 2007 rahman et al 2014 beane freeman et al 2017 kaufman et al 2018 wu et al 2019 china s current regulation set the maximum level of dichloroacetic acid dcaa trichloroacetic acid tcaa trichloromethane tcm bromodichloromethane bdcm dibromochloromethane dbcm and tribromomethane tbm in tap water at 50 100 60 60 100 and 100 Œºg l respectively moreover the sum of the ratio of each thm concentration to its respective guideline value should not exceed 1 moh 2006 in the united states the maximum levels of 4 thms sum of tcm bdcm dbcm and tbm and 5 haas sum of monochloroacetic acid dcaa tcaa monobromoacetic acid and dibromoacetic acid have been set to 80 and 60 Œºg l respectively mian et al 2018 dbps formation is a rather complicated process which is mainly governed by water quality and disinfection conditions for instance om which is often quantified by dissolved organic carbon doc or ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm uva254 selberg et al 2011 hong et al 2013 can act as organic precursors nikolaou and lekkas 2001 hong et al 2008 hua et al 2015 sun et al 2018 increase in disinfectant e g chlorine dose will greatly improve dbps formation and high bromide level will shift the dbps speciation toward more brominated ones hua and reckhow 2012 hong et al 2016 zheng et al 2020 meanwhile ph can influence the form of disinfectant e g cl2 and thus affect dbps formation fukayama et al 1986 hong et al 2017 nitrite and ammonia may also impact dbps formation because they are chlorine consumer hu et al 2010 zhou et al 2019 in addition high temperature and long reaction time will improve the formation of stable dbps e g thms haas but may reduce the yields of unstable ones e g hans xie 2004 dbps monitoring is a laborious job which usually involves the use of toxic solvents complex pretreatment process and expensive instrument e g gas chromatography gas chromatography mass spectrometer etc gonzalez hernandez et al 2017 li and mitch 2018 andersson et al 2019 moreover the measurement of dbps concentration in drinking water usually takes a long time making it impossible to timely control operation parameters to control dbps in practice therefore many predictive dbps models have been developed by linearly log linearly regression of various involved factors chowdhury et al 2009 hong et al 2016 lin et al 2018 shahi et al 2019 these regression models are useful in identifying key factors influencing dbps formation and may help to guide decision making in the drinking water treatment however these models also have some inadequacies that cannot be ignored 1 dbps predictive models are site specific to a large extent because of the differences in water quality and treatment methods used by different regions waterworks for example yoon et al 2003 tried to predict thms formation by chlorination of korean source water using dbps models from united states but found that the predicted value was much higher than the measured ones therefore for a specific region with specific water source and and treatment process it is necessary to establish its own dbps models 2 most available dbps models were developed through simulated disinfection of source water or treated water from water works under carful design in laboratory chowdhury et al 2009 hong et al 2016 lin et al 2018 however the real drinking water should undergo water treatment processes disinfection and pipeline transportation the composition and distribution of dbps are quite different from those obtained from simulated disinfection of source water treated water 3 most models contained the parameter of disinfection time sohn et al 2004 chowdhury et al 2009 hong et al 2016 but for real water supply system it is quite difficult to measure the disinfection time i e how long it takes from the beginning of disinfection in water treatment plant to the end of the user which must consider the distance season water supply data of the sampling points and etc 4 the relationship between dbps formation and varied factors were usually weakly linear log linear which made these models not necessarily effective in predicting dbps formation sadiq and rodriguez 2004 chowdhury et al 2009 ding et al 2013 lin et al 2018 in some cases the prediction accuracy the proportion that the prediction error 25 only reached 58 66 lin et al 2018 because of the above disadvantages it is quite difficult for the available regression models to be put into practice it is essentially necessary to establish dbps models exclusively for real distribution system in a specific area and consider the complicated non linear relationships between various factors and dbps formation in order to develop effective prediction models artificial neural networks ann are powerful tools to deal with complex interactions and they are considered as standard non linear estimators singh and gupta 2012 iliyas et al 2013 yang et al 2013 given the complex non linear relationships between dbps formation and various factors anns may provide an attractive alternative to predict dbps formation nevertheless the studies on prediction of dbps using anns are still very limited based on the latest information from web of science there are seven studies on ann modes for dbps prediction five used back propagation bp ann milot et al 2002 kulkarni and chellam 2010 ye et al 2011 singh and gupta 2012 park et al 2018 another two used autoencoder neural network and hybrid genetic algorithm based ann moradi et al 2017 peleato et al 2018 these studies demonstrated that anns are effective in the prediction of dbps however only two studies were related to actual distribution system ye et al 2011 moradi et al 2017 both of which included the parameter of residence time contact time i e how long it takes from the beginning of disinfection in water treatment plant to the end of the user contact time is easy to measure in a laboratory rather than in actual distribution systems where the distance season and water supply data of the sampling points need to be considered therefore the available ann models on actual distribution system are quite difficult to be put into practice developing ann models for dbps prediction in real distribution system without residence time becomes essential moreover tests of different anns models are still worth further exploration the radial basis function rbf neural network refers to a kind of feed forward neural network with excellent performance rbf network can approximate any non linear function with arbitrary accuracy and realize global approximation without any local minimum problem jin and bai 2016 zhao et al 2019 also it has a fast learning speed because of the compact topological structure han 2006 chen et al 2019 the distinct advantages give rbf anns strong application potential in more and more fields lin 2011 zarbakhsh and addeh 2018 zhao et al 2019 however systematic studies on the application of rbf anns in dbps predictions are few lin et al 2020 on the other hand water quality parameters and or treatment conditions serve as input factors during the development of ann models for dbps prediction ye et al 2011 moradi et al 2017 park et al 2018 however the questions regarding which factors are important or indispensable and which factors are not necessary remain unclear considering the non linear relationship between various factors and dbps formation it might not be suitable to use the traditional method e g regression analysis to identify the importance of factors given the uncertain relationships between dbps formation and various factors dbps formation can be regard as a grey system therefore the gray relational analysis gra specifically used for grey systems may be a good choice to identify the importance of the factors that affect dbps formation the gra is a quantitative method to estimate situational changes among data sequences based on the grey system theory liu and lin 2011 tian et al 2018 it can reveal the non linear relationship between multiple variables according to similarities in their geometric proximity and rank their relational degrees indicator for importance in descending order wong et al 2006 yang et al 2013 deng 2019 therefore gra can be an effective supplement during the construction of ann models for dbps prediction facilitating to set up an ideal model with fewer factors and eventually saving time and cost in water quality monitoring for water treatment plant the main objective of this study is to develop prediction models of dbps formation in 13 water supply systems in 8 counties in jinhua region of zhejiang province in china since thms have been demonstrated to be the most abundant dbps presented in drinking water and the primary drivers of cancer risk li and mitch 2018 the models for tcm bdcm and total thm t thms were included data set on thms levels and water quality parameters were separated into a training group and a testing group for prediction by multiple linear log linear regression mlr rbf ann and gra rbf ann finally the prediction results were evaluated and the advantages of the proposed gra rbf anns over rbf ann and mlr for dbps prediction were discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of dataset the dataset used in this study were originated from our previous study zhou et al 2019 briefly a total of 64 tap water samples 17 samples in summer 24 samples in winter and another 23 samples in spring during 2015 2016 were collected from 13 drinking water treatment works in 8 counties or county level cities in jinhua region which located in the middle of zhejiang province s fig 1 and has a typical sub tropical monsoon climate each water works has its own reservoir s for source water and all used traditional treatment technique i e coagulation sedimentation filter chlorination to make drinking water each sample has two replicates water quality parameters ph temp residual free chlorine doc uva254 nh4 n no2 n and br were determined according to standard method apha 1998 operational processes of certain characterization items can refer to the literature teng et al 2020 wu et al 2020 thms tcm bdcm dbcm and tbm were measured by liquid liquid extraction and gc ecd method according to epa 551 1 usepa 1990 the data of dbps and water quality parameters were shown in s table 1 doc 0 03 2 14 mg l uva254 0 001 0 036 cm and t thms levels 9 1 40 9 ¬µg l in jinhua region were generally lower as compared to the tap water in other place of china

generated using spss software version 16 0 the data sets used to generate and validate the model were the same as those of rbf ann see section 2 3 2 water quality parameters or their logarithmic values were put into as independent variables thms tcm bdcm t thms levels or their logarithmic values were as dependent variables after the step wise multiple regression the water quality parameters were introduced into the equation according to the order of their linear log linear relationship with thms levels in this way the linear log linear regression models were developed eqs 1 and 2 1 thms k a doc b uv a 254 c b r d t e ph f c l 2 g n o 2 n h n h 4 n 2 thms k doc a uv a 254 b b r c t d ph e c l 2 f n o 2 1 n g n h 4 n h where k a b c d e f g and h are empirical constants because some parameters would be removed during stepwise regression the final parameters entering the model were determined by the actual situation the significance of linear and log linear models was testified by the following two methods 1 f test the model is significant Œ± 0 05 0 01 when f fŒ± p n p 1 where p is the number of variables and n is the number of samples 2 goodness of fit test represented by the determination coefficient r 2 if r 2 is close to 1 the degree of the model s goodness of fit is high 2 3 development of the radial basis function rbf ann model 2 3 1 description of the radial basis function rbf ann model a typical rbf ann architecture generally consists of three layers an input an output and a hidden layer fig 1 the hidden nodes in hidden layer use radially symmetric basis functions such as the gaussian function œÜi x as activation functions eq 3 3 œÜ i x exp x c i œÉ i 2 where x represent the water quality parameters ci and œÉi are center and spread of the ith rbf node respectively then the outputs of the non linear activation œÜi x are integrated linearly with the weight vector œâi of the output layer to produce the output network ym eq 4 4 y m i 0 n œÜ i œâ i the training of the radial basis function neural network involved two steps 1 select center from the training data without training or establish the centers by clustering the training data 2 linearly estimate one weighting vector with ordinary least squares in the present study a self organized technique i e orthogonal least square ols technique was used in the selection of center because of its high efficiency chen et al 1991 ols adopts gram schmidt algorithm to select and update the center and adaptive gradient descent to adapt the weights iliyas et al 2013 thus the network parameters can be obtained if the cost function is minimized eq 5 5 min j i 1 q y i y i 2 where q yi and yi are the training pattern number the network output and the desire target output respectively 2 3 2 modeling step of rbf ann or gra rbf ann modeling by rbf ann or gra rbf ann includes the following steps 1 grouping 64 data sets including thms levels and water quality parameters for tap water samples were used in this study s table 1 considering that more training samples will help to get a more robust network 80 51 sets of the datasets were used as training samples and the remaining 20 13 sets as testing samples rbf ann is more suitable for interpolation rather than extrapolation kulkarni and chellam 2010 iliyas et al 2013 chen et al 2020 therefore in order to make the model have the best prediction ability the maximum and the minimums datasets of t thms tcm and bdcm were selected into the training group then the remaining datasets were divided into 8 subgroups according to their level i e the dataset with similar levels were in the same group each subgroup has 7 8 datasets among which 1 2 datasets will be selected into testing group by using random number table in this way the datasets in training group and testing group were both in random and uniform distribution and can represent the whole datasets based on the above rule the grouping of t thm tcm and bdcm of 64 datasets is presented in s table 1 2 modeling after grouping a rbf ann model was established by using the newrb function in matlab net newrb p t goal spread mn df where p is the input vector i e water quality parameters t is the target vector i e tcm bdcm t thms goal is the square error spread is the distribution density of radial basis function mn is the maximum number of neurons df is the number of neurons added between two displays 3 training testing and evaluation training the model was performed as step 2 and its predictive performance was verified with the testing group if the predictive performance is good go to step 5 or else go to step 4 4 adjusting when the predictive performance is not ideal adjust spread mn and water quality parameters for the development of gra rbf ann and again do step 3 until the predictive performance is good 5 stop 2 4 grey relational analysis gra grey relational analysis gra is a method that converts the experimental results into normalized values between 0 and 1 it is actually a measurement of the absolute value of the data difference between sequences and it could be used to measure the approximate correlation between sequences gra performed

thms values then the absolute value of relative error e of the predicted thms level for each input set was calculated eq 11 11 e a b s d b p s predicted d b p s measured d b p s measured n 25 was defined as the percentage of predictions with e 25 the prediction quality of the model was evaluated according to the regression coefficient r 2 and n 25 value in comparison between the predicted and measured dbps data kulkarni and chellam 2010 the higher the n 25 and r 2 values the better the quality of the model 2 5 2 external validation external validation of prediction models was carried out based on the testing samples which were not included in the dataset used to develop models the predicted thms were obtained by the input of the water quality parameters testing dataset to the models then the prediction performance was evaluated by following the same procedures in section 2 5 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 linearly and log linearly regression models linear model 1 3 and log linear model 4 6 models for thms prediction were generated with the training samples no 1 51 in s table 1 the results of the f test for the generated models are shown in table 1 for model 1 3 4 and 6 there are 2 water quality parameters p w equals 2 and the corresponding n p w 1 value is 48 while for model 2 and 5 both of them only have one water quality parameter so the p w and n p w 1 value are 1 and 49 respectively according to the f test table 1 f values of all models are higher than the critical f value at 99 f 2 48 5 077 f 1 49 7 182 or 95 confidence level f 1 49 4 038 demonstrating a

screened based on the order of their linear log linear correlations with thms levels thus the parameters entering the models are usually considered as the most important factors affecting thms formation chowdhury et al 2009 hong et al 2016 though the doc uva254 in distribution system were not those in raw water water before disinfection but according to the evidence from the references they are closely related with each other nissinen et al 2002 liu et al 2011 lin et al 2020 i e doc uva254 in distribution system can still be good indicators for organic and inorganic precursors for dbps formation in this study tcm is positively related with uva254 model 1 4 while bdcm is positively related with doc model 2 5 this result suggests that organic matter with aromatic structures may be important precursors for tcm formation while the om with uv absorbance contributes little to bdcm yields and doc is a better indicator for bdcm precursor a significantly positive impact of uva254 on t thm model 3 6 can be attributed to the fact that tcm is the dominant fraction for t thms yields s table 1 in addition temperature temp shows a negative effect on tcm and t thms levels model 1 3 4 and 6 which seems different from the common notion that high temperature usually enhances thms yields sohn et al 2004 hong et al 2016 this phenomenon may be attributed to the fact that the temperature in this study represented not only the disinfection temperature but also the seasonal change thus the relationship between temperature and thms is probably derived from the seasonal change in the organic precursor despite the significant relationship between the entering parameters and thms level r 2 values the degree of the model s goodness of these regression models r 2 0 126 0 445 model 1 6 are low it suggests that the regression models may not be ideal to predict thms levels in tap water as can be seen from the following prediction results firstly the testing datasets 13 samples s table 1 were served as model input and to obtain the predicted thms levels i e external validation which were then compared with the measured thms concentrations as shown in figs 2 and 3 rp pearson correlation coefficient values for t thms tcm and bdcm ranged from 0 365 to 0 435 0 367 0 459 and 0 254 0 387 respectively indicating a low correlation between the predicted and measured values meanwhile n 25 the percentage of predictions within 25 absolute relative error for t thm tcm and bdcm predictions are in range of 46 69 54 62 and 54 69 respectively suggesting the poor performance of linear and log linear models in the prediction of thms levels in tap water meanwhile the datasets used for generating the regression models 51 training samples as well as all datasets 64 samples were used as model input to further testify the prediction ability of the models results show that both rp and n 25 for t thms tcm and bdcm are not good enough to obtain sound prediction results figs 2 and 3 it should be noted that the rp values 0 254 0 659 and the prediction ability n 25 46 78 of the linear log linear regression models for tap water in this study are generally lower as compared to those regression models developed by the simulated disinfection of source or treated water in the laboratory sohn et al 2004 chowdhury et al 2009 hong et al 2016 the reason may reside in that the simulated disinfected water made in the laboratory is usually carried out under controlled conditions in other words all the parameters e g temperature reaction time initial chlorine dose the initial level of doc uva254 br and others are clearly given and can participate modeling yet the real tap waters are generally disinfected under natural conditions where some parameters like temperature may be always in a kinetic variation and disinfection time cannot be well reflected in the model due to its difficulty in measurement moreover the potential presence of biofilms dead zones and non uniform disinfectant concentrations in the real distribution system may further complicate the relationships between water quality and dbps formation in addition doc uva254 and br in tap water may not be so related to dbps formation as compared to the doc uva254 and br levels in un disinfected water which is commonly used in those models of simulated disinfection in the laboratory all in all the regression method is not ideal for predicting dbps levels in tap water making it urgent to develop alternative methods 3 2 prediction of thms levels by rbf ann and gra rbf ann rbf anns for prediction of tcm bdcm and t thms were generated with function of newrb in software matlab 2018b first 51 datasets no 1 51 in s table 1 were used to train the rbf ann and then the remaining 13 datasets no t1 t13 in s table 1 were used for model validation all the water quality parameters were applied into the modeling after a series of training testing evaluation and adjusting the optimum model values mainly spread s and maximum neurons number mn were obtained s table 2 4 results show that 30 was the optimum mn value for all thms models t thms tcm and bdcm while the optimum spread for t thms tcm and bdcm was 30 70 and 10 respectively s table 2 4 results of the comparisons between the predicted by optimum model and measured thms tcm bdcm and t thms are shown in fig 4 for 13 testing data sets external validation relatively high regression coefficients rp 0 760 0 925 and high n 25 values 92 are obtained fig 4a1 c1 the trained rbf ann also shows excellent prediction ability when 51 training datasets rp 0 894 0 908 n 25 92 98 and all 64 datasets rp 0 877 0 913 n 25 92 97 were used as inputs fig 4a2 c2 a3 c3 the consistently high regression coefficients and n 25 values demonstrate that the rbf ann has high ability to learn the complex non linear relationship between the input parameters and thms formation which cannot be realized by linear log linear regression models this is generally consistent with the results reported by milot et al 2002 that the prediction ability of ann is better than the multivariate regression models fig 4 demonstrates that an ideal rbf ann can be generated with all the water quality parameters however whether the model with fewer factors is still robust remains unknown herein gra which can reveal the non linear relationship between multiple variables according to similarities in their geometric proximity and rank their relational degrees was used to identify the importance of the factors for thms formation grey correlation coefficients for tcm bdcm and t thms are presented as follows tcm ph 0 947 temp 0 925 uva254 0 918 doc 0 913 br 0 911 no2 n 0 895 nh4 n 0 830 cl2 residue 0 772 bdcm ph 0 958 temp 0 935 uva254 0 927 doc 0 922 br 0 921 no2 n 0 903 nh4 n 0

important factors are ph and temp followed by uva254 doc and br while no2 n nh4 n and cl2 residues have less importance it seems to be inconsistent with the key factors doc uva254 and temp identified by regression models section 3 1 the underlying reason may be that grey correlation degree is a measure of distance relationship between curves which represents the proximity of curve geometry and reflects the non linear relationship between dbps formation and the factors other than the linear trend of curves like regression models based on grey correlation coefficients the most important five indicators i e ph temp uva254 doc and br were used to generate a series of new rbf anns named as gra rbf anns during modeling mn was set at 30 based on the optimum mn value obtained in rbf anns fig 4 after series of training testing evaluation and adjusting the optimum spread values were also obtained prediction results of optimum gra rbf anns models are presented in fig 5 n 25 values for external validation internal validation and the overall prediction are 92 96 98 and 95 97 respectively and the rp values regarding the regression between predicted and measured values in gra rbf ann models are in range of 0 760 0 946 fig 5 which are comparable to those in rbf ann models fig 4 rp 0 760 0 925 these results demonstrate that gra is helpful to develop a robust rbf ann model with fewer factors overall the prediction ability of rbfs ann including gra rbf ann is much higher than linear log linear models as shown in fig 6 the distributions of prediction errors for linear and log linear models are greatly scattered ranging from 46 to 174 among them 23 37 of the absolute prediction errors are higher than 25 in contrast most prediction errors 92 97 for rbfs ann including gra rbf ann distribute between 25 and 25 with a very small fraction 3 5 of the absolute errors higher than 25 accurate prediction of rbf and gra rbf networks for thms in tap water demonstrates their potential application to dbps monitoring in the actual distribution system generally speaking two parameters including the maximum number of neurons mn and spread denoted as s or œÉi of gaussian function critically determine the quality of an rbf network jin and bai 2016 fig 7 shows the effects of gaussian function spread s in the rbf network on thm prediction performance by taking tcm as an example among the three spread levels 30 40 and 50 the spread of 30 corresponds to the highest regression coefficients r 0 865 and n 25 values 85 under conditions in this study based on this result the rbf ann method can be further improved by setting spread value as 29 3 fig 7d these results demonstrate that rbf ann method can be further optimized to get more accurate predictions in contrast linear and log linear models assume the functional relationship and their accuracy cannot be improved for the given input data this is also a significant advantage of rbf ann over linear log linear regression methods for dbps prediction 4 conclusions the present study first used rbf ann and gra rbf ann to predict thms levels in real tap water results show that rbf ann consistently displayed higher regression coefficient and better prediction accuracy as compared to linear log linear regression models it suggests the powerful ability of rbf to capture the complicated non linear relationship between the water quality parameters and thms formation meanwhile rbf ann was allowed to further improve the prediction accuracy by adjusting the neuron number or spread of gaussian function in contrast with linear log linear models whose accuracy cannot be improved for the given input data based on gra results rbf anns generated with fewer factors 5 water quality parameters also showed excellent prediction ability this result demonstrates that gra can be an effective way to generate robust rbf ann models with fewer factors all of the results in the present study prove a great

5129,many models have been developed in previous studies for predicting the formation of disinfection by products dbps in drinking water however most of them were linear or log linear regression models and generated based on simulated disinfection of source water or treated water in a laboratory other than real tap water which shows low application potential in practice in this study a radial basis function artificial neural network rbf ann as well as the hybrid method of rbf ann and grey relational analysis gra was proposed to predict trihalomethanes thms levels in real distribution systems a total of 64 sets of data including thms levels trichloromethane tcm bromodichloromethane bdcm and total thms t thms and 8 water quality parameters temperature ph uv absorbance at 254 uva254 dissolved organic carbon bromide residual free chlorine nitrite and ammonia were used to train and verify the proposed model as compared to linear and log linear regression models rp 0 254 0 659 n 25

however disinfectant e g chlorine can react with organic matter om in water producing a variety of disinfection by products dbps including trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas haloacetonitriles hans etc krasner et al 2006 hong et al 2008 2013 ding et al 2013 hur et al 2014 li and mitch 2018 both laboratory studies and epidemiology investigations showed that long term exposure to dbps could increase the risk of cancer and birth defects richardson et al 2007 rahman et al 2014 beane freeman et al 2017 kaufman et al 2018 wu et al 2019 china s current regulation set the maximum level of dichloroacetic acid dcaa trichloroacetic acid tcaa trichloromethane tcm bromodichloromethane bdcm dibromochloromethane dbcm and tribromomethane tbm in tap water at 50 100 60 60 100 and 100 Œºg l respectively moreover the sum of the ratio of each thm concentration to its respective guideline value should not exceed 1 moh 2006 in the united states the maximum levels of 4 thms sum of tcm bdcm dbcm and tbm and 5 haas sum of monochloroacetic acid dcaa tcaa monobromoacetic acid and dibromoacetic acid have been set to 80 and 60 Œºg l respectively mian et al 2018 dbps formation is a rather complicated process which is mainly governed by water quality and disinfection conditions for instance om which is often quantified by dissolved organic carbon doc or ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm uva254 selberg et al 2011 hong et al 2013 can act as organic precursors nikolaou and lekkas 2001 hong et al 2008 hua et al 2015 sun et al 2018 increase in disinfectant e g chlorine dose will greatly improve dbps formation and high bromide level will shift the dbps speciation toward more brominated ones hua and reckhow 2012 hong et al 2016 zheng et al 2020 meanwhile ph can influence the form of disinfectant e g cl2 and thus affect dbps formation fukayama et al 1986 hong et al 2017 nitrite and ammonia may also impact dbps formation because they are chlorine consumer hu et al 2010 zhou et al 2019 in addition high temperature and long reaction time will improve the formation of stable dbps e g thms haas but may reduce the yields of unstable ones e g hans xie 2004 dbps monitoring is a laborious job which usually involves the use of toxic solvents complex pretreatment process and expensive instrument e g gas chromatography gas chromatography mass spectrometer etc gonzalez hernandez et al 2017 li and mitch 2018 andersson et al 2019 moreover the measurement of dbps concentration in drinking water usually takes a long time making it impossible to timely control operation parameters to control dbps in practice therefore many predictive dbps models have been developed by linearly log linearly regression of various involved factors chowdhury et al 2009 hong et al 2016 lin et al 2018 shahi et al 2019 these regression models are useful in identifying key factors influencing dbps formation and may help to guide decision making in the drinking water treatment however these models also have some inadequacies that cannot be ignored 1 dbps predictive models are site specific to a large extent because of the differences in water quality and treatment methods used by different regions waterworks for example yoon et al 2003 tried to predict thms formation by chlorination of korean source water using dbps models from united states but found that the predicted value was much higher than the measured ones therefore for a specific region with specific water source and and treatment process it is necessary to establish its own dbps models 2 most available dbps models were developed through simulated disinfection of source water or treated water from water works under carful design in laboratory chowdhury et al 2009 hong et al 2016 lin et al 2018 however the real drinking water should undergo water treatment processes disinfection and pipeline transportation the composition and distribution of dbps are quite different from those obtained from simulated disinfection of source water treated water 3 most models contained the parameter of disinfection time sohn et al 2004 chowdhury et al 2009 hong et al 2016 but for real water supply system it is quite difficult to measure the disinfection time i e how long it takes from the beginning of disinfection in water treatment plant to the end of the user which must consider the distance season water supply data of the sampling points and etc 4 the relationship between dbps formation and varied factors were usually weakly linear log linear which made these models not necessarily effective in predicting dbps formation sadiq and rodriguez 2004 chowdhury et al 2009 ding et al 2013 lin et al 2018 in some cases the prediction accuracy the proportion that the prediction error 25 only reached 58 66 lin et al 2018 because of the above disadvantages it is quite difficult for the available regression models to be put into practice it is essentially necessary to establish dbps models exclusively for real distribution system in a specific area and consider the complicated non linear relationships between various factors and dbps formation in order to develop effective prediction models artificial neural networks ann are powerful tools to deal with complex interactions and they are considered as standard non linear estimators singh and gupta 2012 iliyas et al 2013 yang et al 2013 given the complex non linear relationships between dbps formation and various factors anns may provide an attractive alternative to predict dbps formation nevertheless the studies on prediction of dbps using anns are still very limited based on the latest information from web of science there are seven studies on ann modes for dbps prediction five used back propagation bp ann milot et al 2002 kulkarni and chellam 2010 ye et al 2011 singh and gupta 2012 park et al 2018 another two used autoencoder neural network and hybrid genetic algorithm based ann moradi et al 2017 peleato et al 2018 these studies demonstrated that anns are effective in the prediction of dbps however only two studies were related to actual distribution system ye et al 2011 moradi et al 2017 both of which included the parameter of residence time contact time i e how long it takes from the beginning of disinfection in water treatment plant to the end of the user contact time is easy to measure in a laboratory rather than in actual distribution systems where the distance season and water supply data of the sampling points need to be considered therefore the available ann models on actual distribution system are quite difficult to be put into practice developing ann models for dbps prediction in real distribution system without residence time becomes essential moreover tests of different anns models are still worth further exploration the radial basis function rbf neural network refers to a kind of feed forward neural network with excellent performance rbf network can approximate any non linear function with arbitrary accuracy and realize global approximation without any local minimum problem jin and bai 2016 zhao et al 2019 also it has a fast learning speed because of the compact topological structure han 2006 chen et al 2019 the distinct advantages give rbf anns strong application potential in more and more fields lin 2011 zarbakhsh and addeh 2018 zhao et al 2019 however systematic studies on the application of rbf anns in dbps predictions are few lin et al 2020 on the other hand water quality parameters and or treatment conditions serve as input factors during the development of ann models for dbps prediction ye et al 2011 moradi et al 2017 park et al 2018 however the questions regarding which factors are important or indispensable and which factors are not necessary remain unclear considering the non linear relationship between various factors and dbps formation it might not be suitable to use the traditional method e g regression analysis to identify the importance of factors given the uncertain relationships between dbps formation and various factors dbps formation can be regard as a grey system therefore the gray relational analysis gra specifically used for grey systems may be a good choice to identify the importance of the factors that affect dbps formation the gra is a quantitative method to estimate situational changes among data sequences based on the grey system theory liu and lin 2011 tian et al 2018 it can reveal the non linear relationship between multiple variables according to similarities in their geometric proximity and rank their relational degrees indicator for importance in descending order wong et al 2006 yang et al 2013 deng 2019 therefore gra can be an effective supplement during the construction of ann models for dbps prediction facilitating to set up an ideal model with fewer factors and eventually saving time and cost in water quality monitoring for water treatment plant the main objective of this study is to develop prediction models of dbps formation in 13 water supply systems in 8 counties in jinhua region of zhejiang province in china since thms have been demonstrated to be the most abundant dbps presented in drinking water and the primary drivers of cancer risk li and mitch 2018 the models for tcm bdcm and total thm t thms were included data set on thms levels and water quality parameters were separated into a training group and a testing group for prediction by multiple linear log linear regression mlr rbf ann and gra rbf ann finally the prediction results were evaluated and the advantages of the proposed gra rbf anns over rbf ann and mlr for dbps prediction were discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of dataset the dataset used in this study were originated from our previous study zhou et al 2019 briefly a total of 64 tap water samples 17 samples in summer 24 samples in winter and another 23 samples in spring during 2015 2016 were collected from 13 drinking water treatment works in 8 counties or county level cities in jinhua region which located in the middle of zhejiang province s fig 1 and has a typical sub tropical monsoon climate each water works has its own reservoir s for source water and all used traditional treatment technique i e coagulation sedimentation filter chlorination to make drinking water each sample has two replicates water quality parameters ph temp residual free chlorine doc uva254 nh4 n no2 n and br were determined according to standard method apha 1998 operational processes of certain characterization items can refer to the literature teng et al 2020 wu et al 2020 thms tcm bdcm dbcm and tbm were measured by liquid liquid extraction and gc ecd method according to epa 551 1 usepa 1990 the data of dbps and water quality parameters were shown in s table 1 doc 0 03 2 14 mg l uva254 0 001 0 036 cm and t thms levels 9 1 40 9 ¬µg l in jinhua region were generally lower as compared to the tap water in other place of china

generated using spss software version 16 0 the data sets used to generate and validate the model were the same as those of rbf ann see section 2 3 2 water quality parameters or their logarithmic values were put into as independent variables thms tcm bdcm t thms levels or their logarithmic values were as dependent variables after the step wise multiple regression the water quality parameters were introduced into the equation according to the order of their linear log linear relationship with thms levels in this way the linear log linear regression models were developed eqs 1 and 2 1 thms k a doc b uv a 254 c b r d t e ph f c l 2 g n o 2 n h n h 4 n 2 thms k doc a uv a 254 b b r c t d ph e c l 2 f n o 2 1 n g n h 4 n h where k a b c d e f g and h are empirical constants because some parameters would be removed during stepwise regression the final parameters entering the model were determined by the actual situation the significance of linear and log linear models was testified by the following two methods 1 f test the model is significant Œ± 0 05 0 01 when f fŒ± p n p 1 where p is the number of variables and n is the number of samples 2 goodness of fit test represented by the determination coefficient r 2 if r 2 is close to 1 the degree of the model s goodness of fit is high 2 3 development of the radial basis function rbf ann model 2 3 1 description of the radial basis function rbf ann model a typical rbf ann architecture generally consists of three layers an input an output and a hidden layer fig 1 the hidden nodes in hidden layer use radially symmetric basis functions such as the gaussian function œÜi x as activation functions eq 3 3 œÜ i x exp x c i œÉ i 2 where x represent the water quality parameters ci and œÉi are center and spread of the ith rbf node respectively then the outputs of the non linear activation œÜi x are integrated linearly with the weight vector œâi of the output layer to produce the output network ym eq 4 4 y m i 0 n œÜ i œâ i the training of the radial basis function neural network involved two steps 1 select center from the training data without training or establish the centers by clustering the training data 2 linearly estimate one weighting vector with ordinary least squares in the present study a self organized technique i e orthogonal least square ols technique was used in the selection of center because of its high efficiency chen et al 1991 ols adopts gram schmidt algorithm to select and update the center and adaptive gradient descent to adapt the weights iliyas et al 2013 thus the network parameters can be obtained if the cost function is minimized eq 5 5 min j i 1 q y i y i 2 where q yi and yi are the training pattern number the network output and the desire target output respectively 2 3 2 modeling step of rbf ann or gra rbf ann modeling by rbf ann or gra rbf ann includes the following steps 1 grouping 64 data sets including thms levels and water quality parameters for tap water samples were used in this study s table 1 considering that more training samples will help to get a more robust network 80 51 sets of the datasets were used as training samples and the remaining 20 13 sets as testing samples rbf ann is more suitable for interpolation rather than extrapolation kulkarni and chellam 2010 iliyas et al 2013 chen et al 2020 therefore in order to make the model have the best prediction ability the maximum and the minimums datasets of t thms tcm and bdcm were selected into the training group then the remaining datasets were divided into 8 subgroups according to their level i e the dataset with similar levels were in the same group each subgroup has 7 8 datasets among which 1 2 datasets will be selected into testing group by using random number table in this way the datasets in training group and testing group were both in random and uniform distribution and can represent the whole datasets based on the above rule the grouping of t thm tcm and bdcm of 64 datasets is presented in s table 1 2 modeling after grouping a rbf ann model was established by using the newrb function in matlab net newrb p t goal spread mn df where p is the input vector i e water quality parameters t is the target vector i e tcm bdcm t thms goal is the square error spread is the distribution density of radial basis function mn is the maximum number of neurons df is the number of neurons added between two displays 3 training testing and evaluation training the model was performed as step 2 and its predictive performance was verified with the testing group if the predictive performance is good go to step 5 or else go to step 4 4 adjusting when the predictive performance is not ideal adjust spread mn and water quality parameters for the development of gra rbf ann and again do step 3 until the predictive performance is good 5 stop 2 4 grey relational analysis gra grey relational analysis gra is a method that converts the experimental results into normalized values between 0 and 1 it is actually a measurement of the absolute value of the data difference between sequences and it could be used to measure the approximate correlation between sequences gra performed

defined as the percentage of predictions with e 25 the prediction quality of the model was evaluated according to the regression coefficient r 2 and n 25 value in comparison between the predicted and measured dbps data kulkarni and chellam 2010 the higher the n 25 and r 2 values the better the quality of the model 2 5 2 external validation external validation of prediction models was carried out based on the testing samples which were not included in the dataset used to develop models the predicted thms were obtained by the input of the water quality parameters testing dataset to the models then the prediction performance was evaluated by following the same procedures in section 2 5 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 linearly and log linearly regression models linear model 1 3 and log linear model 4 6 models for thms prediction were generated with the training samples no 1 51 in s table 1 the results of the f test for the generated models are shown in table 1 for model 1 3 4 and 6 there are 2 water quality parameters p w equals 2 and the corresponding n p w 1 value is 48 while for model 2 and 5 both of them only have one water quality parameter so the p w and n p w 1 value are 1 and 49 respectively according to the f test table 1 f values of all models are higher than the critical f value at 99 f 2 48 5 077 f 1 49 7 182 or 95 confidence level f 1 49 4 038 demonstrating a

screened based on the order of their linear log linear correlations with thms levels thus the parameters entering the models are usually considered as the most important factors affecting thms formation chowdhury et al 2009 hong et al 2016 though the doc uva254 in distribution system were not those in raw water water before disinfection but according to the evidence from the references they are closely related with each other nissinen et al 2002 liu et al 2011 lin et al 2020 i e doc uva254 in distribution system can still be good indicators for organic and inorganic precursors for dbps formation in this study tcm is positively related with uva254 model 1 4 while bdcm is positively related with doc model 2 5 this result suggests that organic matter with aromatic structures may be important precursors for tcm formation while the om with uv absorbance contributes little to bdcm yields and doc is a better indicator for bdcm precursor a significantly positive impact of uva254 on t thm model 3 6 can be attributed to the fact that tcm is the dominant fraction for t thms yields s table 1 in addition temperature temp shows a negative effect on tcm and t thms levels model 1 3 4 and 6 which seems different from the common notion that high temperature usually enhances thms yields sohn et al 2004 hong et al 2016 this phenomenon may be attributed to the fact that the temperature in this study represented not only the disinfection temperature but also the seasonal change thus the relationship between temperature and thms is probably derived from the seasonal change in the organic precursor despite the significant relationship between the entering parameters and thms level r 2 values the degree of the model s goodness of these regression models r 2 0 126 0 445 model 1 6 are low it suggests that the regression models may not be ideal to predict thms levels in tap water as can be seen from the following prediction results firstly the testing datasets 13 samples s table 1 were served as model input and to obtain the predicted thms levels i e external validation which were then compared with the measured thms concentrations as shown in figs 2 and 3 rp pearson correlation coefficient values for t thms tcm and bdcm ranged from 0 365 to 0 435 0 367 0 459 and 0 254 0 387 respectively indicating a low correlation between the predicted and measured values meanwhile n 25 the percentage of predictions within 25 absolute relative error for t thm tcm and bdcm predictions are in range of 46 69 54 62 and 54 69 respectively suggesting the poor performance of linear and log linear models in the prediction of thms levels in tap water meanwhile the datasets used for generating the regression models 51 training samples as well as all datasets 64 samples were used as model input to further testify the prediction ability of the models results show that both rp and n 25 for t thms tcm and bdcm are not good enough to obtain sound prediction results figs 2 and 3 it should be noted that the rp values 0 254 0 659 and the prediction ability n 25 46 78 of the linear log linear regression models for tap water in this study are generally lower as compared to those regression models developed by the simulated disinfection of source or treated water in the laboratory sohn et al 2004 chowdhury et al 2009 hong et al 2016 the reason may reside in that the simulated disinfected water made in the laboratory is usually carried out under controlled conditions in other words all the parameters e g temperature reaction time initial chlorine dose the initial level of doc uva254 br and others are clearly given and can participate modeling yet the real tap waters are generally disinfected under natural conditions where some parameters like temperature may be always in a kinetic variation and disinfection time cannot be well reflected in the model due to its difficulty in measurement moreover the potential presence of biofilms dead zones and non uniform disinfectant concentrations in the real distribution system may further complicate the relationships between water quality and dbps formation in addition doc uva254 and br in tap water may not be so related to dbps formation as compared to the doc uva254 and br levels in un disinfected water which is commonly used in those models of simulated disinfection in the laboratory all in all the regression method is not ideal for predicting dbps levels in tap water making it urgent to develop alternative methods 3 2 prediction of thms levels by rbf ann and gra rbf ann rbf anns for prediction of tcm bdcm and t thms were generated with function of newrb in software matlab 2018b first 51 datasets no 1 51 in s table 1 were used to train the rbf ann and then the remaining 13 datasets no t1 t13 in s table 1 were used for model validation all the water quality parameters were applied into the modeling after a series of training testing evaluation and adjusting the optimum model values mainly spread s and maximum neurons number mn were obtained s table 2 4 results show that 30 was the optimum mn value for all thms models t thms tcm and bdcm while the optimum spread for t thms tcm and bdcm was 30 70 and 10 respectively s table 2 4 results of the comparisons between the predicted by optimum model and measured thms tcm bdcm and t thms are shown in fig 4 for 13 testing data sets external validation relatively high regression coefficients rp 0 760 0 925 and high n 25 values 92 are obtained fig 4a1 c1 the trained rbf ann also shows excellent prediction ability when 51 training datasets rp 0 894 0 908 n 25 92 98 and all 64 datasets rp 0 877 0 913 n 25 92 97 were used as inputs fig 4a2 c2 a3 c3 the consistently high regression coefficients and n 25 values demonstrate that the rbf ann has high ability to learn the complex non linear relationship between the input parameters and thms formation which cannot be realized by linear log linear regression models this is generally consistent with the results reported by milot et al 2002 that the prediction ability of ann is better than the multivariate regression models fig 4 demonstrates that an ideal rbf ann can be generated with all the water quality parameters however whether the model with fewer factors is still robust remains unknown herein gra which can reveal the non linear relationship between multiple variables according to similarities in their geometric proximity and rank their relational degrees was used to identify the importance of the factors for thms formation grey correlation coefficients for tcm bdcm and t thms are presented as follows tcm ph 0 947 temp 0 925 uva254 0 918 doc 0 913 br 0 911 no2 n 0 895 nh4 n 0 830 cl2 residue 0 772 bdcm ph 0 958 temp 0 935 uva254 0 927 doc 0 922 br 0 921 no2 n 0 903 nh4 n 0

important factors are ph and temp followed by uva254 doc and br while no2 n nh4 n and cl2 residues have less importance it seems to be inconsistent with the key factors doc uva254 and temp identified by regression models section 3 1 the underlying reason may be that grey correlation degree is a measure of distance relationship between curves which represents the proximity of curve geometry and reflects the non linear relationship between dbps formation and the factors other than the linear trend of curves like regression models based on grey correlation coefficients the most important five indicators i e ph temp uva254 doc and br were used to generate a series of new rbf anns named as gra rbf anns during modeling mn was set at 30 based on the optimum mn value obtained in rbf anns fig 4 after series of training testing evaluation and adjusting the optimum spread values were also obtained prediction results of optimum gra rbf anns models are presented in fig 5 n 25 values for external validation internal validation and the overall prediction are 92 96 98 and 95 97 respectively and the rp values regarding the regression between predicted and measured values in gra rbf ann models are in range of 0 760 0 946 fig 5 which are comparable to those in rbf ann models fig 4 rp 0 760 0 925 these results demonstrate that gra is helpful to develop a robust rbf ann model with fewer factors overall the prediction ability of rbfs ann including gra rbf ann is much higher than linear log linear models as shown in fig 6 the distributions of prediction errors for linear and log linear models are greatly scattered ranging from 46 to 174 among them 23 37 of the absolute prediction errors are higher than 25 in contrast most prediction errors 92 97 for rbfs ann including gra rbf ann distribute between 25 and 25 with a very small fraction 3 5 of the absolute errors higher than 25 accurate prediction of rbf and gra rbf networks for thms in tap water demonstrates their potential application to dbps monitoring in the actual distribution system generally speaking two parameters including the maximum number of neurons mn and spread denoted as s or œÉi of gaussian function critically determine the quality of an rbf network jin and bai 2016 fig 7 shows the effects of gaussian function spread s in the rbf network on thm prediction performance by taking tcm as an example among the three spread levels 30 40 and 50 the spread of 30 corresponds to the highest regression coefficients r 0 865 and n 25 values 85 under conditions in this study based on this result the rbf ann method can be further improved by setting spread value as 29 3 fig 7d these results demonstrate that rbf ann method can be further optimized to get more accurate predictions in contrast linear and log linear models assume the functional relationship and their accuracy cannot be improved for the given input data this is also a significant advantage of rbf ann over linear log linear regression methods for dbps prediction 4 conclusions the present study first used rbf ann and gra rbf ann to predict thms levels in real tap water results show that rbf ann consistently displayed higher regression coefficient and better prediction accuracy as compared to linear log linear regression models it suggests the powerful ability of rbf to capture the complicated non linear relationship between the water quality parameters and thms formation meanwhile rbf ann was allowed to further improve the prediction accuracy by adjusting the neuron number or spread of gaussian function in contrast with linear log linear models whose accuracy cannot be improved for the given input data based on gra results rbf anns generated with fewer factors 5 water quality parameters also showed excellent prediction ability this result demonstrates that gra can be an effective way to generate robust rbf ann models with fewer factors all of the results in the present study prove a great potential of rbf ann especially gra rbf ann for dbps monitoring in real tap water credit authorship contribution statement huachang hong funding acquisition writing original draft zhiying zhang
