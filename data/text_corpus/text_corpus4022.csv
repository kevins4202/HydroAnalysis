20110,the united nations has adopted accelerators policies or programs that target multiple sdgs to expedite delivery of the sustainable development goals sdgs this rapid review examines the potential application of accelerators in water interventions from 2015 to 2020 with special consideration of how gender is integrated to fast track sdg implementation as a cross cutting case while 86 of water projects acknowledged sdg interlinkages project indicators did not reflect sdg acceleration objectives for example despite widespread acknowledgement of gender as a critical sdg issue only a fifth of

acceleration frameworks it was used to analyze how a cross cutting issue was incorporated at different project stages the gender scale utilized in this review was the united nations university unu gender integration scale 37 table 4 this scale draws upon gender integration scales developed by bilateral and un agencies 38 39 in particular idrc s conceptualization of four programmatic gender lenses from gender aware projects that broadly addressed gender in project rationales to gender sensitive projects that include gender considerations in methodology but do not have an extensive gender analysis to gender responsive projects that include an extensive gender analysis but does not address root causes of gender disparity and gender transformative projects that target root causes of inequity 40 the unu scale added a fifth classification gender blind projects which indicates no evident gender considerations in programming 2 5 limitations the search parameters only covered projects that explicitly mentioned the sdgs and included descriptions and evaluations of implementation admittedly these parameters might have restricted the number of eligible projects and some water themes which may render localised issues underrepresented however the sdg keyword helped target projects that intentionally framed interventions in the context of global agendas as a sdg accelerator should local programming may have potential to contribute to the global agenda but if they were not designed with the global agenda in mind they might not be generalizable which limits their ability to be applied in other settings or scaled up for future studies additional databases and organizations within water and gender sectors may be considered to expand the search additionally the gender blind label may not be reflective of all project objectives or the implementing organization s principles projects ranked as gender blind were categorized as such because gender was overlooked in the methods and or analysis for example the unicef 2019a assessment on healthcare wash facilities in kenya was categorized as gender blind as there was no explicit reference to gender in the case study s methods or analysis sections both unicef and the government of kenya however recognize gender equality in principle the reason for this oversight might be due to the tendency in the development sector to work in silos as reflected in the reviewed publications focusing on water related as opposed to gender related objectives for grey literature only websites of un related organizations were screened using google advanced search due to the assumption that these organizations would have substantial documentation of their extensive work that directly tied to sdgs however even though many resources from un collaborators and partners were found on un websites documents that satisfied the inclusion criteria were limited mainly because these documents reported results and provided limited details if any on project implementation and evaluation which are inclusion criteria for this review excluding non english literature might have resulted in projects described in other languages being overlooked while inclusion of non english projects can avoid bias 41 studies have indicated that english literature covers most research and thus non english exclusion should not significantly affect findings 42 43 3 results 3 1 project selection a total of 42 projects in 33 articles and reports published between 2015 and 2020 met the inclusion criteria fig 1 data extracted from the 42 projects is featured in annex 4 all projects were based in lmics with 95 implemented in africa and asia n 40 fig 2 six projects focused solely on rural populations whereas 16 projects placed emphasis on rural areas in combination with urban or school populations the remaining 20 projects focused on other populations ranging from users informal settlement residents and refugees to project implementers service providers and governments and researchers 3 2 sdg projects fig 3 illustrates the review s breadth of sdg coverage with 36 of the 42 86 projects targeting two or more sdgs in total 16 of the 17 sdgs were targeted with no project focusing on sdg 7 energy fig 4 illustrates the water sector s thematic sdg targeting in an evidence map overall most projects focused on wash agriculture or water resources management projects from these three major themes contributed not only to sdg 5 and 6 but also to sdgs 1 3 and 8 the evidence map revealed limited programmatic evidence on water security and water related ecosystems interventions most projects 93 n 39 contributed to sdg 6 clean water and sanitation which is expected as this review focuses on interventions in the water sector the three projects not associated with sdg 6 had an sdg 2 zero hunger emphasis two projects focused on the management of water related climate disasters from an agricultural standpoint 45 46 and the third on small scale fisheries security 47 these projects were included due to their utilization of water resilience practices in food production annex 5 provides further details on acceleration through the combination of sdg 6 and gender equality health economic growth and climate action objectives in 39 sdg 6 projects the next section discusses the application of accelerators in 36 water projects 3 3 accelerators fig 5 depicts the coverage of 11 mechanisms or policy oriented accelerators in 36 water projects the remaining six projects did not address more than one sdg thereby not qualifying as an accelerator project accelerators drew from several disciplines ranging from policy studies economics health and environmental science of the un water classifications 7 enhanced governance was the most common accelerator 28 n 10 which was applied across wash 48 51 conservation 52 aquaculture 47 and agricultural development 45 53 projects a fifth of projects 19 n 7 were innovative when assessing wash technologies 54 55 or applying climate smart methods in agriculture and flood management 45 53 56 innovation projects used non conventional methods and technologies to accelerate progress such as implementation of water tariffs carbon water filters or micro watershed approaches nearly a fifth of projects 17 n 6 were survey oriented and hence had a strong data and information emphasis to assess impact of wash interventions in households 54 57 schools 58 and in three country level health facility interventions 51 finance was used to accelerate sdg achievement in four projects 11 focused on enhancing water supply and treatment 59 and building rural community resilience to climate change associated droughts 45 53 56 six further policy oriented accelerators were identified following undp dimensions framing 6 these accelerators either enhanced intervention design to enabled development progress in five projects 14 in the wash 58 60 62 and agriculture sectors 45 or aimed for a lagging program outcome linked to behavior change infrastructure design female participation gender equality or economic development a fifth of the projects 19 n 7 utilized wash behavior change programming in communities 60 63 65 schools 66 or in mixed household school settings 61 67 two 6 wash projects provided recommendations to redesign infrastructure in india s national sanitation policy based on user needs especially for females 48 49 interestingly while this review covered 12 sdg 6 and 5 projects it is important to note that only six of these projects applied a gender associated accelerator the six projects targeted either female participation or gender equality two 6 projects included women in climate planning processes 46 and employed them in a water infrastructure project that also utilized local economic development as an accelerator 68 four projects 11 went beyond female participation by targeting root causes of gender disparity and aiming for gender equality in watershed management 56 agriculture 46 wash 62 and higher education 69 of the 36 projects with accelerators 13 36 applied multiple accelerators twelve of these projects eight wash one water supply and treatment and two agriculture variably combined two of the 11 accelerators the thirteenth project applied three accelerators governance financing and innovation to reform dated water management laws identify new tariffs and develop adaptation strategies in rural farming communities 53 a closer analysis suggests that broadness in either objectives or perspectives was a common characteristic five projects had multiple objectives 48 49 54 60 61 seven projects were intersectoral in nature two employed vulnerable populations as laborers in water infrastructure projects 45 68 two integrated climate environmental and water knowledge to strengthen governance and capacity development initiatives 53 69 and three supported wash in institutional settings 51 58 3 4 gender integration the evidence map fig 6 indicates limited gender integration in water security and water related ecosystems interventions notably while wash interventions account for the largest proportion among the six water intervention themes the gender lens employed is mostly limited to a gender sensitive level gender sensitive projects made up half of the projects 48 n 20 this means gender was considered in the project s design and methodology usually in the form of disaggregated data collection though the data were not necessarily analyzed for example seven gender sensitive projects integrated gender considerations in their methods by ensuring participation of women in surveys or focus groups and or including gender as a sociodemographic variable 50 57 58 60 64 65 70 among these gender sensitive projects 18 were wash interventions and two were agriculture and food security interventions at the lowest scale level 19 n 8 of the projects were gender blind meaning gender was overlooked in the projects gender aware interventions comprised 12 n 5 of projects with gender being mentioned in the rationale but not included as a component in the methods or discussion section 12 n 5 of projects were gender responsive as they incorporated gender within their methodology and analyzed gender disaggregated data two of these projects collected gender associated data and analyzed how female participation in comparison to males within wash interventions can enhance water security and safe behaviors 61 71 additionally the remaining three gender responsive projects evaluated gender equality gaps in national policies or provided certified training for women 46 47 67 68 71 only 4 projects 9 n 4 had gender transformative objectives these projects strove for structural changes by going beyond the typical programmatic focus of gender mainstreaming instead they addressed root causes underpinning gender discrimination in government policies and processes when building climate resilient societies 46 56 community relationships in wash programs 62 and higher education of future wash sector leaders 69 these projects also employed clearly defined gender specific indicators such as enhancing financial growth for women through increased participation in agricultural practices or bridging the gap in gendered divisions of labor and power through wash programming further supporting their gender transformative function 4 discussion 4 1 accelerators the 86 of included water projects that focused on two or more sdgs tended to be associated with social health or environmental sciences interestingly the six projects that did not utilize sdg accelerators were evaluations of wash projects a rural infrastructure project 71 a national policy 84 two school programs 83 86 and two research tools 70 85 while these six projects only comprise of a quarter of the wash projects in the review it nevertheless highlights that evaluative criterion should cover more than normative facility related data notably nearly a third of the projects applied multiple accelerators these projects tended to be multi objective intersectoral projects that aimed to challenge the status quo by reinventing governance or finance systems or reforming outdated laws and practices the evidence maps indicated that water professionals in the wash agriculture and climate change sectors have produced more evidence on sdg accelerators compared to water resource management and ecosystems professionals wash professionals in particular published several impact evaluations to enhance intervention designs such guidance which often is reflected upon in detail in donor reports but not published grey literature is useful to widely distribute to build the evidence base for the nascent field of implementation science in the development sector further analysis of how integrated and intersectoral sdg acceleration projects such as those identified in this review can advance policy processes would especially be of value to strengthen implementation of the 2030 agenda the authors found that accelerator frameworks from undp and un water were useful assessment tools that helped unpack complex interlinkages between the sdgs and highlighted potential gaps and opportunities to strategically target multiple sdgs in water interventions which might especially be useful among lmics with limited resources and capacity the tools can potentially aid collective planning efforts and help address the challenge of joined up or integrating siloed planning implementation and evaluation which reportedly have limited success in both the millennium development goal and sustainable development goals eras 20 72 75 greater harmonization of the sdg accelerator concepts such as definitions and frameworks can potentially advance implementation of acceleration programs on the former un policy instruments should have common definitions to enable collective goal setting and achievement and to facilitate comparisons in performance across sectors given that the sdgs are inherently interdependent it is strategic to develop acceleration programs that target multiple sdgs as opposed to fast tracking achievement of standalone goals while this review has focused on program design from an implementation perspective the research community can also be engaged to enhance conceptualization and tools development in particular greater collaboration with the research community can contribute to the development of a harmonized accelerator language comprehensive taxonomy by mechanisms impact categories and themes and range of cross cutting evaluation tools such as the gender scale discussed in the next section to aid coordinated design implementation and evaluation of integrated projects 4 2 gender integration a gender integration tool was used to assess mainstreaming of this cross cutting issue across different project stages only a fifth of 42 water projects investigated root causes of gender inequality most projects 48 were gender sensitive meaning they had gender considerations in their methods but did not or only minimally analyzed this data if gender sensitive projects had a gender objective the projects tended to target what leahy et al described as practical gender needs 62 practical gender programming addresses perceived necessities or living condition inadequacies in a specific context strategic gender programming in contrast broadly challenges gender inequality by addressing societal gender roles expressed as inequitable divisions of labor power and control especially over one s body 62 such strategic gender programming aligns with the gender responsive and transformative ratings in the study s gender integration scale only a fifth of 42 water projects investigated root causes of gender inequality macarthur et al 2020 similarly found in a critical review of a decade of wash gender literature that few studies engaged with transformational aspects of gender equality 30 this underuse of strategic and transformative gender programming in the water sector indicates there is much room for improvement to reduce gender inequality in an impactful way through the integration of either gender responsive or gender transformative lenses in hindsight the limited integration of transformative gender objectives in water interventions perhaps reflects a broader sectoral trend while the cross cutting potential of gender equality interventions in development initiatives was highlighted by the 1995 beijing platform for action 76 sdg 6 has no gender specific indicators 77 there is insufficient utilization of gender disaggregated data or explicit discussions in water projects 78 as well as a surprisingly limited number of water projects that had gender specific targets 79 this is despite the sector s acknowledgement of the importance of universal access especially amongst women and girls who often face availability accessibility and physical safety constraints due to the compound effects of gender based discrimination 80 81 if progress is to be made in reducing gender inequality the systems of power and societal constraints underpinning inequities need to be challenged across all sectors to enable systemic changes more gender disaggregated data of high quality is hence needed to inform evidence based gender equality programming in the water sector 79 and strategically address inequitable divisions of labor power and control aligning sdg 6 programming to meet the needs of women and gender diverse populations can potentially advance data collection and policy integration of this cross cutting issue in the water sector data alignment measures include the integration of gender specific sdg targets in water projects to build the gender equality evidence base the sdgs have 53 gender specific indicators 14 of which are associated with the standalone sdg 5 and the remaining 39 as cross cutting targets under 10 other sdgs that either explicitly disaggregate data by gender or target equality as a development objective 77 integration of indicator 16 7 2 perceptions of inclusion in decision making by sex for example can readily be incorporated in project surveys or focus groups to shed light on women s decision making power which is a root cause of inadequate water access among women 82 gender equality considerations can be integrated into water interventions through multiple ways putting synergistic progress on the sdgs within the water sector s reach 5 conclusion given that accelerators are an emerging concept in the development sector this review examines the potential of accelerators as a policy instrument to expedite the water sector s contributions to multiple sdgs it highlights useful instruments that the water sector can utilize to design accelerators during the un decade of action sdg achievement can significantly be fast tracked by integrating cross cutting themes such as gender into project evaluative frameworks further research is needed to aid the development of a common language collection of disaggregated data and design of integrative tools that can facilitate accelerator implementation additionally research on deeper dives into synergistic accelerators including other cross cutting issues such as climate change as well as more project delivery and evaluation data is critically needed to strengthen the development sector s implementation science evidence base in developing and learning from this evidence base and systematically using cross cutting lenses the water

gender integration scale 37 table 4 this scale draws upon gender integration scales developed by bilateral and un agencies 38 39 in particular idrc s conceptualization of four programmatic gender lenses from gender aware projects that broadly addressed gender in project rationales to gender sensitive projects that include gender considerations in methodology but do not have an extensive gender analysis to gender responsive projects that include an extensive gender analysis but does not address root causes of gender disparity and gender transformative projects that target root causes of inequity 40 the unu scale added a fifth classification gender blind projects which indicates no evident gender considerations in programming 2 5 limitations the search parameters only covered projects that explicitly mentioned the sdgs and included descriptions and evaluations of implementation admittedly these parameters might have restricted the number of eligible projects and some water themes which may render localised issues underrepresented however the sdg keyword helped target projects that intentionally framed interventions in the context of global agendas as a sdg accelerator should local programming may have potential to contribute to the global agenda but if they were not designed with the global agenda in mind they might not be generalizable which limits their ability to be applied in other settings or scaled up for future studies additional databases and organizations within water and gender sectors may be considered to expand the search additionally the gender blind label may not be reflective of all project objectives or the implementing organization s principles projects ranked as gender blind were categorized as such because gender was overlooked in the methods and or analysis for example the unicef 2019a assessment on healthcare wash facilities in kenya was categorized as gender blind as there was no explicit reference to gender in the case study s methods or analysis sections both unicef and the government of kenya however recognize gender equality in principle the reason for this oversight might be due to the tendency in the development sector to work in silos as reflected in the reviewed publications focusing on water related as opposed to gender related objectives for grey literature only websites of un related organizations were screened using google advanced search due to the assumption that these organizations would have substantial documentation of their extensive work that directly tied to sdgs however even though many resources from un collaborators and partners were found on un websites documents that satisfied the inclusion criteria were limited mainly because these documents reported results and provided limited details if any on project implementation and evaluation which are inclusion criteria for this review excluding non english literature might have resulted in projects described in other languages being overlooked while inclusion of non english projects can avoid bias 41 studies have indicated that english literature covers most research and thus non english exclusion should not significantly affect findings 42 43 3 results 3 1 project selection a total of 42 projects in 33 articles and reports published between 2015 and 2020 met the inclusion criteria fig 1 data extracted from the 42 projects is featured in annex 4 all projects were based in lmics with 95 implemented in africa and asia n 40 fig 2 six projects focused solely on rural populations whereas 16 projects placed emphasis on rural areas in combination with urban or school populations the remaining 20 projects focused on other populations ranging from users informal settlement residents and refugees to project implementers service providers and governments and researchers 3 2 sdg projects fig 3 illustrates the review s breadth of sdg coverage with 36 of the 42 86 projects targeting two or more sdgs in total 16 of the 17 sdgs were targeted with no project focusing on sdg 7 energy fig 4 illustrates the water sector s thematic sdg targeting in an evidence map overall most projects focused on wash agriculture or water resources management projects from these three major themes contributed not only to sdg 5 and 6 but also to sdgs 1 3 and 8 the evidence map revealed limited programmatic evidence on water security and water related ecosystems interventions most projects 93 n 39 contributed to sdg 6 clean water and sanitation which is expected as this review focuses on interventions in the water sector the three projects not associated with sdg 6 had an sdg 2 zero hunger emphasis two projects focused on the management of water related climate disasters from an agricultural standpoint 45 46 and the third on small scale fisheries security 47 these projects were included due to their utilization of water resilience practices in food production annex 5 provides further details on acceleration through the combination of sdg 6 and gender equality health economic growth and climate action objectives in 39 sdg 6 projects the next section discusses the application of accelerators in 36 water projects 3 3 accelerators fig 5 depicts the coverage of 11 mechanisms or policy oriented accelerators in 36 water projects the remaining six projects did not address more than one sdg thereby not qualifying as an accelerator project accelerators drew from several disciplines ranging from policy studies economics health and environmental science of the un water classifications 7 enhanced governance was the most common accelerator 28 n 10 which was applied across wash 48 51 conservation 52 aquaculture 47 and agricultural development 45 53 projects a fifth of projects 19 n 7 were innovative when assessing wash technologies 54 55 or applying climate smart methods in agriculture and flood management 45 53 56 innovation projects used non conventional methods and technologies to accelerate progress such as implementation of water tariffs carbon water filters or micro watershed approaches nearly a fifth of projects 17 n 6 were survey oriented and hence had a strong data and information emphasis to assess impact of wash interventions in households 54 57 schools 58 and in three country level health facility interventions 51 finance was used to accelerate sdg achievement in four projects 11 focused on enhancing water supply and treatment 59 and building rural community resilience to climate change associated droughts 45 53 56 six further policy oriented accelerators were identified following undp dimensions framing 6 these accelerators either enhanced intervention design to enabled development progress in five projects 14 in the wash 58 60 62 and agriculture sectors 45 or aimed for a lagging program outcome linked to behavior change infrastructure design female participation gender equality or economic development a fifth of the projects 19 n 7 utilized wash behavior change programming in communities 60 63 65 schools 66 or in mixed household school settings 61 67 two 6 wash projects provided recommendations to redesign infrastructure in india s national sanitation policy based on user needs especially for females 48 49 interestingly while this review covered 12 sdg 6 and 5 projects it is important to note that only six of these projects applied a gender associated accelerator the six projects targeted either female participation or gender equality two 6 projects included women in climate planning processes 46 and employed them in a water infrastructure project that also utilized local economic development as an accelerator 68 four projects 11 went beyond female participation by targeting root causes of gender disparity and aiming for gender equality in watershed management 56 agriculture 46 wash 62 and higher education 69 of the 36 projects with accelerators 13 36 applied multiple accelerators twelve of these projects eight wash one water supply and treatment and two agriculture variably combined two of the 11 accelerators the thirteenth project applied three accelerators governance financing and innovation to reform dated water management laws identify new tariffs and develop adaptation strategies in rural farming communities 53 a closer analysis suggests that broadness in either objectives or perspectives was a common characteristic five projects had multiple objectives 48 49 54 60 61 seven projects were intersectoral in nature two employed vulnerable populations as laborers in water infrastructure projects 45 68 two integrated climate environmental and water knowledge to strengthen governance and capacity development initiatives 53 69 and three supported wash in institutional settings 51 58 3 4 gender integration the evidence map fig 6 indicates limited gender integration in water security and water related ecosystems interventions notably while wash interventions account for the largest proportion among the six water intervention themes the gender lens employed is mostly limited to a gender sensitive level gender sensitive projects made up half of the projects 48 n 20 this means gender was considered in the project s design and methodology usually in the form of disaggregated data collection though the data were not necessarily analyzed for example seven gender sensitive projects integrated gender considerations in their methods by ensuring participation of women in surveys or focus groups and or including gender as a sociodemographic variable 50 57 58 60 64 65 70 among these gender sensitive projects 18 were wash interventions and two were agriculture and food security interventions at the lowest scale level 19 n 8 of the projects were gender blind meaning gender was overlooked in the projects gender aware interventions comprised 12 n 5 of projects with gender being mentioned in the rationale but not included as a component in the methods or discussion section 12 n 5 of projects were gender responsive as they incorporated gender within their methodology and analyzed gender disaggregated data two of these projects collected gender associated data and analyzed how female participation in comparison to males within wash interventions can enhance water security and safe behaviors 61 71 additionally the remaining three gender responsive projects evaluated gender equality gaps in national policies or provided certified training for women 46 47 67 68 71 only 4 projects 9 n 4 had gender transformative objectives these projects strove for structural changes by going beyond the typical programmatic focus of gender mainstreaming instead they addressed root causes underpinning gender discrimination in government policies and processes when building climate resilient societies 46 56 community relationships in wash programs 62 and higher education of future wash sector leaders 69 these projects also employed clearly defined gender specific indicators such as enhancing financial growth for women through increased participation in agricultural practices or bridging the gap in gendered divisions of labor and power through wash programming further supporting their gender transformative function 4 discussion 4 1 accelerators the 86 of included water projects that focused on two or more sdgs tended to be associated with social health or environmental sciences interestingly the six projects that did not utilize sdg accelerators were evaluations of wash projects a rural infrastructure project 71 a national policy 84 two school programs 83 86 and two research tools 70 85 while these six projects only comprise of a quarter of the wash projects in the review it nevertheless highlights that evaluative criterion should cover more than normative facility related data notably nearly a third of the projects applied multiple accelerators these projects tended to be multi objective intersectoral projects that aimed to challenge the status quo by reinventing governance or finance systems or reforming outdated laws and practices the evidence maps indicated that water professionals in the wash agriculture and climate change sectors have produced more evidence on sdg accelerators compared to water resource management and ecosystems professionals wash professionals in particular published several impact evaluations to enhance intervention designs such guidance which often is reflected upon in detail in donor reports but not published grey literature is useful to widely distribute to build the evidence base for the nascent field of implementation science in the development sector further analysis of how integrated and intersectoral sdg acceleration projects such as those identified in this review can advance policy processes would especially be of value to strengthen implementation of the 2030 agenda the authors found that accelerator frameworks from undp and un water were useful assessment tools that helped unpack complex interlinkages between the sdgs and highlighted potential gaps and opportunities to strategically target multiple sdgs in water interventions which might especially be useful among lmics with limited resources and capacity the tools can potentially aid collective planning efforts and help address the challenge of joined up or integrating siloed planning implementation and evaluation which reportedly have limited success in both the millennium development goal and sustainable development goals eras 20 72 75 greater harmonization of the sdg accelerator concepts such as definitions and frameworks can potentially advance implementation of acceleration programs on the former un policy instruments should have common definitions to enable collective goal setting and achievement and to facilitate comparisons in performance across sectors given that the sdgs are inherently interdependent it is strategic to develop acceleration programs that target multiple sdgs as opposed to fast tracking achievement of standalone goals while this review has focused on program design from an implementation perspective the research community can also be engaged to enhance conceptualization and tools development in particular greater collaboration with the research community can contribute to the development of a harmonized accelerator language comprehensive taxonomy by mechanisms impact categories and themes and range of cross cutting evaluation tools such as the gender scale discussed in the next section to aid coordinated design implementation and evaluation of integrated projects 4 2 gender integration a gender integration tool was used to assess mainstreaming of this cross cutting issue across different project stages only a fifth of 42 water projects investigated root causes of gender inequality most projects 48 were gender sensitive meaning they had gender considerations in their methods but did not or only minimally analyzed this data if gender sensitive projects had a gender objective the projects tended to target what leahy et al described as practical gender needs 62 practical gender programming addresses perceived necessities or living condition inadequacies in a specific context strategic gender programming in contrast broadly challenges gender inequality by addressing societal gender roles expressed as inequitable divisions of labor power and control especially over one s body 62 such strategic gender programming aligns with the gender responsive and transformative ratings in the study s gender integration scale only a fifth of 42 water projects investigated root causes of gender inequality macarthur et al 2020 similarly found in a critical review of a decade of wash gender literature that few studies engaged with transformational aspects of gender equality 30 this underuse of strategic and transformative gender programming in the water sector indicates there is much room for improvement to reduce gender inequality in an impactful way through the integration of either gender responsive or gender transformative lenses in hindsight the limited integration of transformative gender objectives in water interventions perhaps reflects a broader sectoral trend while the cross cutting potential of gender equality interventions in development initiatives was highlighted by the 1995 beijing platform for action 76 sdg 6 has no gender specific indicators 77 there is insufficient utilization of gender disaggregated data or explicit discussions in water projects 78 as well as a surprisingly limited number of water projects that had gender specific targets 79 this is despite the sector s acknowledgement of the importance of universal access especially amongst women and girls who often face availability accessibility and physical safety constraints due to the compound effects of gender based discrimination 80 81 if progress is to be made in reducing gender inequality the systems of power and societal constraints underpinning inequities need to be challenged across all sectors to enable systemic changes more gender disaggregated data of high quality is hence needed to inform evidence based gender equality programming in the water sector 79 and strategically address inequitable divisions of labor power and control aligning sdg 6 programming to meet the needs of women and gender diverse populations can potentially advance data collection and policy integration of this cross cutting issue in the water sector data alignment measures include the integration of gender specific sdg targets in water projects to build the gender equality evidence base the sdgs have 53 gender specific indicators 14 of which are associated with the standalone sdg 5 and the remaining 39 as cross cutting targets under 10 other sdgs that either explicitly disaggregate data by gender or target equality as a development objective 77 integration of indicator 16 7 2 perceptions of inclusion in decision making by sex for example can readily be incorporated in project surveys or focus groups to shed light on women s decision making power which is a root cause of inadequate water access among women 82 gender equality considerations can be integrated into water interventions through multiple ways putting synergistic progress on the sdgs within the water sector s reach 5 conclusion given that accelerators are an emerging concept in the development sector this review examines the potential of accelerators as a policy instrument to expedite the water sector s contributions to multiple sdgs it highlights useful instruments that the water sector can utilize to design accelerators during the un decade of action sdg achievement can significantly be fast tracked by integrating cross cutting themes such as gender into project evaluative frameworks further research is needed to aid the development of a common language collection of disaggregated data and design of integrative tools that can facilitate accelerator implementation additionally research on deeper dives into synergistic accelerators including other cross cutting issues such as climate change as well as more project delivery and evaluation data is critically needed to strengthen the development sector s implementation science evidence base in developing and learning from this evidence base and systematically using cross cutting lenses the water

20111,climate change impacts have not previously been systematically considered in the selection and prioritisation of measures to manage flood risks in finland for the second flood risk management planning cycle according to the eu floods directive we developed a framework for evaluating the adaptability of measures to expected changes in climate and land use our aim was to 1 provide regional data for flood risk managers and water resources planners 2 develop a nationally consistent approach to identify the robustness of considered measures for a variety of conditions which 3 is applicable in both river basin management planning and flood risk management planning according to the feedback from practitioners in regional flood management groups as well as planners the framework helped to raise new thoughts and to open new perspectives in the planning process and may hence influence the practice of planning of flood risk reduction measures also it was found useful to have access to regional tailored data on hydrological impacts in the planning process and during communication with stakeholders the described methodology has been used in the preparation of the 2nd version of flood risk management plans and for the 3rd version of river basin management plans it is intended to use the same approach for next planning cycles keywords flood risk management climate proofing climate change adaptation risk based approach 1 introduction climate change has various impacts on the environment both the quality and quantity of water resources and hence on society some of these impacts are already evident e g 21 49 but during the coming decades they are likely to increase and intensify significantly 15 46 the eu floods directive 2007 60 ec required the member states to perform a first preliminary flood risk assessment and to identify significant flood risk areas and to draft flood maps and flood risk management plans frmps by the end of 2015 the review of this process is about to be finalized when frmps and the 3rd round of river basin management rbm plans according to the eu water framework directive 2000 60 ec undergo the updates that are meant to take place by 22 12 2021 there are 22 designated areas of significant flood risk due to fluvial and coastal floods in finland 13 climate change impacts have not previously been systematically considered in the selection and prioritisation of measures to manage water quality and flood risks in finland 9 for the planning cycle for 2021 2027 the impacts of climate change can however be studied more systematically and on a regional scale accordingly it is possible to evaluate how climate proof measures are and to select those measures that help mitigate harmful impacts most and promote adaptation in this paper we use the term climate proof for measures and strategies that are either robust meaning they perform under a variety of conditions or flexible so that they can be adapted or modified to changing conditions finland is a quite sparsely populated northern country because of its length the temperature gradient from south to north is strong 33 which affects the amount of snow and moment of melting there is significant spatial variation in potential flood impacts due to the large number of watersheds of variable size the thousands of lakes in some parts of the country against fewer elsewhere and the country s long coastline 22 44 at the same time the water level regulation of natural lakes and reservoirs and post glacial land uplift simplify flood risk management frm in many areas moreover finland has a long tradition of flood protection and water management but since the risks vary significantly now and will even more so in the future there is a strong need for national guidance on climate proof flood risk management in finland regional centres for economic development transport and the environment are responsible for frm in their area for cooperation between the authorities necessary for preparing the frmp and implementing it flood management groups have been established for river basin and coastal areas where one or several significant flood risk areas have been designated 13 14 a flood management group sets the objectives for frm whereas the finnish environment institute offers expert services guidance and support to regional centres and flood management groups the development of a methodology for climate proofing frmp and the description of scenarios and impacts described in this article are part of these services the methodology is meant to be used consistently throughout the nation but specified regionally by the flood management groups in this paper we focus on flood risk management but the methodology equally applies to river basin management as required by the eu water framework directive in this paper we introduce a framework for evaluating how to assess the effectiveness of frm measures against the expected changes in climate and land use our objective was to 1 strengthen the knowledge base of climate change impacts on water resources and risks in finland 2 develop an approach that helps identify robust measures that are applicable in a variety of conditions 3 support the consideration of climate change and synergies in both frm and rbm planning 2 climate change impacts on hydrology in northern areas climate change affects water resources both directly and indirectly rising temperatures increased rainfall and decreasing snow cover affect water quantity water quality biological productivity and species distribution as well as groundwater levels and soil moisture 46 41 in finland climate change will significantly influence the seasonal variation of river discharges and water levels in lakes 45 46 seasonal snow cover and spring snowmelt have been important characteristics of the hydrological regime in finland and climate change will cause significant changes to this seasonal rhythm 46 hydrological simulations were carried out with the methods described by veijalainen et al 44 and veijalainen 46 for which the most recent climate scenarios based on representative concentration pathways rcps 29 were used namely rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 in order to produce the full picture of possible climate change impacts on floods an ensemble of scenarios is needed several climate scenarios were used to assess the relevant range of possible and likely changes this range also included extreme scenarios which in this context means scenarios where the future changes in temperature and precipitation in finland projected by the global climate models or regional global combination are larger or smaller than average for that rcp these extreme scenarios include warm dry warm wet cold dry and cold wet scenarios uncertainty from climate models is the major uncertainty on shorter time scales before 2050 while the rcps become the largest source of uncertainty by the end of the century 17 in the flood risk assessment 25 climate scenarios based on the cmip5 coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 simulations from ipcc s intergovernmental panel on climate change 5th assessment report 39 18 were used based on four rcps 29 these scenarios included 5 average scenarios with four rcps 8 extreme scenarios from global climate models with three rcps rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 and 12 scenarios from regional climate models with the same three rcps as for global 19 nine of these scenarios one average and eight extreme were selected from a larger ensemble of global climate change scenarios including warm cold wet and dry scenarios four average scenarios were calculated as monthly averages by the finnish meteorological institute 35 changes in flood magnitude fig 1 were estimated according to the approach used by veijalainen et al 44 but with the new set of 25 climate scenarios as input with the hydrological model the daily discharges for 30 year periods were simulated as well as the 100 year floods based on annual maximums and assuming a gumbel distribution these 100 year floods for future periods are compared to the reference period 1981 2010 to estimate the degree of change according to the simulations figs 1 and 2 wintertime runoff is projected to increase significantly while snowmelt runoff in spring will decrease the changes call for an adjustment of the current frm practices which have primarily focused on controlling spring floods finland s watersheds differ from each other in flood producing mechanisms snowmelt flood rainfall floods size watershed characteristics soil types land use lake percentage 22 and regional climate northern finland average temperature 6 9 degrees lower than southern finland 33 therefore the climate change impacts on floods also vary in different parts of the country and different watersheds fig 1 44 46 snow volume is projected to decrease in southern and central finland resulting in decreasing spring floods in these areas an increase in precipitation together with milder temperatures is expected to increase autumn and winter floods instead the largest increases are projected for the large central lakes and their outflow rivers where winter floods will become the largest floods fig 1 in northern finland spring floods will remain the largest floods during the entire century and stay unchanged or decrease by the end of the century fig 1 however in the short term floods remain unchanged or may even increase this is due to an increase in precipitation which in the coldest parts of finland will still mainly fall as snow during winter despite milder temperatures and a shorter winter season based on the simulations the flood risk increases or stays unchanged in the areas with significant flood risk in the southern part of the country in the western and northern parts of the country the flood risk in areas with significant flood risk mainly decreases or stays unchanged the differences between watersheds and their climate will also mean that different climate scenarios will produce the largest floods in the future in northern finland the largest floods will be produced by cold and wet scenarios where snow amounts remain large fig 2 in southern finland and especially on large lakes and their outflow rivers the warm and wet scenarios produce the largest autumn and winter floods and the largest increases in floods fig 2 downscaled hydrological scenarios have previously been accessible only for the regional planners in non user friendly excel format now the data is updated open to all and in a visual format on the web according to feedback from frm and rbm planners visualisations and simplifications on climate change impacts are useful for communication with stakeholders the trade offs between simplicity and uncertainties should however be considered carefully it was not included in the study how credible the planners considered different time horizons and scenarios when discussing with stakeholders this perspective may become more significant 3 future flood risks in finland flood risk is a combination of the probability that an event will occur and the impact or consequence associated with that event 37 in many areas both flood hazard and the number of inhabitants either decrease or increase consequently flood risk may grow due to increased vulnerability or exposure even if flood hazard decreases a recent study by parjanne et al 31 indicates that in many areas in finland socioeconomic development has a stronger effect on the development of future flood risk than climate change in adaptive frm both factors should be considered parjanne et al 31 not only assessed the potential changes due to climate change but also those due to changes in population building stock and economic development they thus derived the change in flood risk by calculation methods generally applied in frm and hence resulting in internationally comparable outcomes e g 38 12 the assessment was based on six scenarios a matrix of three socioeconomic scenarios ssps and three climate change scenarios rcps kc and lutz 2017 29 30 each downscaled to the areas of significant flood risk the assessment concerned the years 2015 2100 the results are scaled for each significant flood risk area and for the whole of finland flood risk changes are described in terms of potentially affected residents and economic damage potential immaterial or indirect damages or effects caused by operations being suspended were not considered the effectiveness and profitability of different frm measures and strategies can be assessed on the basis of the calculated expected annual damages based on this assessment it was concluded that flood risks in finland are likely to multiply if frm measures are not implemented according to planning and without counteracting adaptation measures fig 3 31 in the short term frm should be adapted in response to the effects of population growth and the ageing of the population in flood risk areas in the long term it is also crucial to prepare for climate change but the regional differences are significant and need to be taken into account for some areas the flood risk may almost vanish due to the simultaneous strongly negative population trend and a decrease in flood hazard due to less snow accumulation in winter for other areas mainly the larger cities along the coast or large rivers flood risk is expected to increase in the future due to more rainfall and an increasing damage potential coastal floods most likely pose the largest flood risk in the future the life span of many structural flood risk measures is decades new land use and building permits may cause the damage potential to rise even for centuries consequently it is extremely difficult to predict future flood risks and the best ways to mitigate those 1 considering different scenarios to support the regional planning of flood proofing is a good starting point if used properly if flood risks are expected to increase in an area of significant flood risk the assessed increase should be taken into account when updating frmps and implementing measures however future scenarios cannot yet be recommended as starting point for planning in areas with a diminishing flood risk due to the uncertainties related to background factors and the slow and possibly non linear progress of change planning should therefore be based on a flood risk assessment that represents the current situation at the least as mentioned previously future flood risk assessments do not consider possible changes in the ability to adapt to flood risks land use planning or policy that is the reason why the assessments are planned to be updated every 6 12 years to support frm 4 procedure for climate proofing of flood risk management plans due to changes in climate as well as socioeconomic changes large uncertainties prevail in assessing impacts on water resources and flood risks according to ray and brown 34 two fundamental issues limit the use of climate scenarios to inform decision making lack of description of local hydrologic variability and extremes and lack of characterising the magnitude of climatic risks compared with other risks thus robustness based decision tools are needed to cope with these uncertainties the european commission s guidance on integrating climate change and biodiversity into environmental impact assessment european 8 encourages assessing baseline development trends drivers limit and threshold values using causal networks and identifying especially sensitive vulnerable areas in addition instead of snapshots the guideline stresses analysing long term trends knowledge on the impacts of climate change is of key importance when planning adaptation the first step according to calliari et al 2 is to assess how climate change affects the functioning of ecosystems next there should be an evaluation of how the performance of an action changes over a certain period and whether it still fulfils the original objectives in the future evans et al 12 considered different scenarios to establish what might happen to flood risk a long way in the future döll et al 5 propose a risk based approach that focuses on consequences instead of trying to better predict future weather conditions both maintain there is a need to integrate climate change into all parts of the planning process i e considering impacts and their uncertainty additionally climate change should be assessed in comparison to other pressures like land use and preferably water management should also contribute to climate change mitigation not only focus on adaptation 5 an appropriate time horizon for its assessment follows from the lifespan of the measure 48 if the lifetime is short like many campaigns to raise awareness it may be sufficient to evaluate the benefits at the baseline correspondingly measures whose lifespan extends over decades like building new dikes or buildings should be assessed against different hydrological and land use scenarios for many decades adaptive management helps to avoid under or over adaptation there are several assessment methods for assessing adaptation strategies under uncertainties e g robust decision making 26 real options analysis 50 and the adaptation pathways approach 16 additionally the six year planning cycles according to the eu floods directive and the eu water framework directive are based on the principle of adaptive management we developed our climate proofing framework on the basis of the approach of wilby and dessai 48 who proposed a scenario neutral adaptation method this is in line with front runner nations in europe on adaptive frm the united kingdom and the netherlands e g 12 20 in the uk by 2004 evans et al 11 had already recommended a shift to an integrated approach to flood risk management where frm should use a portfolio of measures whilst accepting future uncertainty and aiming to maintain flexibility e g 3 the environment agency 6 encourages risk management authorities to develop projects schemes and strategies that can be adapted to a range of future climate change scenarios the best known example is the thames estuary 2100 plan which was designed to be adaptable to different projections for climate change and sea level rise 7 the plan is reviewed and updated every 10 years the netherlands has a long tradition of flood risk management in the flood protection act of 1996 an adaptive planning cycle of five years was introduced changed to a six year cycle after the floods directive was implemented the delta program 2008 focuses on climate change adaptation and applies a risk approach for dealing with flood risk the prevailing principle is that the country should anticipate instead of respond to disasters maximise flexibility keep options open and avoid lock in 16 the delta program uses the adaptation pathways method and focuses on increasing system robustness especially when it comes to risk reduction and water robust planning 42 the starting point of our finnish framework is to reduce the vulnerability to climate variation adaptation is based on improving the capability of existing strategies to cope with change the key idea is to identify alternatives that are needed now and most likely useful in future circumstances to overcome uncertainty no low regret measures are given priority fig 4 in the first frm planning cycle the focus was on current flood risk and its management fig 4 for selecting the preferred measures costs benefits side effects and feasibility of potential measures were evaluated using for example a participatory multi criteria decision analysis approach 27 36 however changes in climate and land use were not included in the evaluation for the second cycle the european commission 10 suggested that all measures should be climate proofed the preferred measures mainly from the first planning cycle were then also re evaluated by their effect on future risks to ensure that they are robust or flexible the assessment should result in the prioritisation of robust measures an integral criterion for the planning of climate proofing is adaptability meaning that the plans are constantly being improved based on new evidence the assessment framework is intended to be used at strategic and planning level in preparation of regional frmps and to ensure that climate change is considered flood management groups or regional authorities are strongly suggested to score every measure and to include the scoring together with justifications in the frmps more detailed dimensioning of measures also regarding to climate change can be done later in the project planning stage the framework for climate proofing consists of three steps in each step the assessment uses a 5 step qualitative scale in step 1 it is evaluated how anticipated changes in conditions affect the performance of each measure compared with the baseline the 5 step scale is good no impact on the performance fairly good moderate not very good poor poor performance the measures are evaluated against several hydrological and land use change scenarios table 1 in step 2 the flexibility of each measure is assessed flexibility means the ability to be modified from a technical economic and or administrative point of view 50 it is especially necessary to assess the flexibility of measures that have a long 20 years life span the 5 step scale is very flexible quite flexible not very flexible not at all flexible difficult to assess it is recommended to justify the judgement e g by explaining how the changing climate or land use can be considered in the design or implementation of the measure or how to increase its flexibility in step 3 the overall score for each measure is derived from the combination of the robustness step 1 and flexibility step 2 of each measure fig 5 the overall score is not based on any weighting of the two criteria but is a subjective rating considering both climate proof measures could be robust meaning they perform under a variety of conditions or flexible so that they can be adapted or modified to changing conditions or both flexibility may compensate for shortcomings in robustness therefore a measure may reach a high score even if it performs well on one criterion only the framework thus relies on expert judgement allowing measure specific considerations this explains how a certain measure can be classified as being climate proof even if its robustness is not evaluated as good in all scenarios in step 1 or if it is inflexible but very robust the classes for the overall score are the following very climate proof the measure has good

20111,climate change impacts have not previously been systematically considered in the selection and prioritisation of measures to manage flood risks in finland for the second flood risk management planning cycle according to the eu floods directive we developed a framework for evaluating the adaptability of measures to expected changes in climate and land use our aim was to 1 provide regional data for flood risk managers and water resources planners 2 develop a nationally consistent approach to identify the robustness of considered measures for a variety of conditions which 3 is applicable in both river basin management planning and flood risk management planning according to the feedback from practitioners in regional flood management groups as well as planners the framework helped to raise new thoughts and to open new perspectives in the planning process and may hence influence the practice of planning of flood risk reduction measures also it was found useful to have access to regional tailored data on hydrological impacts in the planning process and during communication with stakeholders the described methodology has been used in the preparation of the 2nd version of flood risk management plans and for the 3rd version of river basin management plans it is intended to use the same approach for next planning cycles keywords flood risk management climate proofing climate change adaptation risk based approach 1 introduction climate change has various impacts on the environment both the quality and quantity of water resources and hence on society some of these impacts are already evident e g 21 49 but during the coming decades they are likely to increase and intensify significantly 15 46 the eu floods directive 2007 60 ec required the member states to perform a first preliminary flood risk assessment and to identify significant flood risk areas and to draft flood maps and flood risk management plans frmps by the end of 2015 the review of this process is about to be finalized when frmps and the 3rd round of river basin management rbm plans according to the eu water framework directive 2000 60 ec undergo the updates that are meant to take place by 22 12 2021 there are 22 designated areas of significant flood risk due to fluvial and coastal floods in finland 13 climate change impacts have not previously been systematically considered in the selection and prioritisation of measures to manage water quality and flood risks in finland 9 for the planning cycle for 2021 2027 the impacts of climate change can however be studied more systematically and on a regional scale accordingly it is possible to evaluate how climate proof measures are and to select those measures that help mitigate harmful impacts most and promote adaptation in this paper we use the term climate proof for measures and strategies that are either robust meaning they perform under a variety of conditions or flexible so that they can be adapted or modified to changing conditions finland is a quite sparsely populated northern country because of its length the temperature gradient from south to north is strong 33 which affects the amount of snow and moment of melting there is significant spatial variation in potential flood impacts due to the large number of watersheds of variable size the thousands of lakes in some parts of the country against fewer elsewhere and the country s long coastline 22 44 at the same time the water level regulation of natural lakes and reservoirs and post glacial land uplift simplify flood risk management frm in many areas moreover finland has a long tradition of flood protection and water management but since the risks vary significantly now and will even more so in the future there is a strong need for national guidance on climate proof flood risk management in finland regional centres for economic development transport and the environment are responsible for frm in their area for cooperation between the authorities necessary for preparing the frmp and implementing it flood management groups have been established for river basin and coastal areas where one or several significant flood risk areas have been designated 13 14 a flood management group sets the objectives for frm whereas the finnish environment institute offers expert services guidance and support to regional centres and flood management groups the development of a methodology for climate proofing frmp and the description of scenarios and impacts described in this article are part of these services the methodology is meant to be used consistently throughout the nation but specified regionally by the flood management groups in this paper we focus on flood risk management but the methodology equally applies to river basin management as required by the eu water framework directive in this paper we introduce a framework for evaluating how to assess the effectiveness of frm measures against the expected changes in climate and land use our objective was to 1 strengthen the knowledge base of climate change impacts on water resources and risks in finland 2 develop an approach that helps identify robust measures that are applicable in a variety of conditions 3 support the consideration of climate change and synergies in both frm and rbm planning 2 climate change impacts on hydrology in northern areas climate change affects water resources both directly and indirectly rising temperatures increased rainfall and decreasing snow cover affect water quantity water quality biological productivity and species distribution as well as groundwater levels and soil moisture 46 41 in finland climate change will significantly influence the seasonal variation of river discharges and water levels in lakes 45 46 seasonal snow cover and spring snowmelt have been important characteristics of the hydrological regime in finland and climate change will cause significant changes to this seasonal rhythm 46 hydrological simulations were carried out with the methods described by veijalainen et al 44 and veijalainen 46 for which the most recent climate scenarios based on representative concentration pathways rcps 29 were used namely rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 in order to produce the full picture of possible climate change impacts on floods an ensemble of scenarios is needed several climate scenarios were used to assess the relevant range of possible and likely changes this range also included extreme scenarios which in this context means scenarios where the future changes in temperature and precipitation in finland projected by the global climate models or regional global combination are larger or smaller than average for that rcp these extreme scenarios include warm dry warm wet cold dry and cold wet scenarios uncertainty from climate models is the major uncertainty on shorter time scales before 2050 while the rcps become the largest source of uncertainty by the end of the century 17 in the flood risk assessment 25 climate scenarios based on the cmip5 coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 simulations from ipcc s intergovernmental panel on climate change 5th assessment report 39 18 were used based on four rcps 29 these scenarios included 5 average scenarios with four rcps 8 extreme scenarios from global climate models with three rcps rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 and 12 scenarios from regional climate models with the same three rcps as for global 19 nine of these scenarios one average and eight extreme were selected from a larger ensemble of global climate change scenarios including warm cold wet and dry scenarios four average scenarios were calculated as monthly averages by the finnish meteorological institute 35 changes in flood magnitude fig 1 were estimated according to the approach used by veijalainen et al 44 but with the new set of 25 climate scenarios as input with the hydrological model the daily discharges for 30 year periods were simulated as well as the 100 year floods based on annual maximums and assuming a gumbel distribution these 100 year floods for future periods are compared to the reference period 1981 2010 to estimate the degree of change according to the simulations figs 1 and 2 wintertime runoff is projected to increase significantly while snowmelt runoff in spring will decrease the changes call for an adjustment of the current frm practices which have primarily focused on controlling spring floods finland s watersheds differ from each other in flood producing mechanisms snowmelt flood rainfall floods size watershed characteristics soil types land use lake percentage 22 and regional climate northern finland average temperature 6 9 degrees lower than southern finland 33 therefore the climate change impacts on floods also vary in different parts of the country and different watersheds fig 1 44 46 snow volume is projected to decrease in southern and central finland resulting in decreasing spring floods in these areas an increase in precipitation together with milder temperatures is expected to increase autumn and winter floods instead the largest increases are projected for the large central lakes and their outflow rivers where winter floods will become the largest floods fig 1 in northern finland spring floods will remain the largest floods during the entire century and stay unchanged or decrease by the end of the century fig 1 however in the short term floods remain unchanged or may even increase this is due to an increase in precipitation which in the coldest parts of finland will still mainly fall as snow during winter despite milder temperatures and a shorter winter season based on the simulations the flood risk increases or stays unchanged in the areas with significant flood risk in the southern part of the country in the western and northern parts of the country the flood risk in areas with significant flood risk mainly decreases or stays unchanged the differences between watersheds and their climate will also mean that different climate scenarios will produce the largest floods in the future in northern finland the largest floods will be produced by cold and wet scenarios where snow amounts remain large fig 2 in southern finland and especially on large lakes and their outflow rivers the warm and wet scenarios produce the largest autumn and winter floods and the largest increases in floods fig 2 downscaled hydrological scenarios have previously been accessible only for the regional planners in non user friendly excel format now the data is updated open to all and in a visual format on the web according to feedback from frm and rbm planners visualisations and simplifications on climate change impacts are useful for communication with stakeholders the trade offs between simplicity and uncertainties should however be considered carefully it was not included in the study how credible the planners considered different time horizons and scenarios when discussing with stakeholders this perspective may become more significant 3 future flood risks in finland flood risk is a combination of the probability that an event will occur and the impact or consequence associated with that event 37 in many areas both flood hazard and the number of inhabitants either decrease or increase consequently flood risk may grow due to increased vulnerability or exposure even if flood hazard decreases a recent study by parjanne et al 31 indicates that in many areas in finland socioeconomic development has a stronger effect on the development of future flood risk than climate change in adaptive frm both factors should be considered parjanne et al 31 not only assessed the potential changes due to climate change but also those due to changes in population building stock and economic development they thus derived the change in flood risk by calculation methods generally applied in frm and hence resulting in internationally comparable outcomes e g 38 12 the assessment was based on six scenarios a matrix of three socioeconomic scenarios ssps and three climate change scenarios rcps kc and lutz 2017 29 30 each downscaled to the areas of significant flood risk the assessment concerned the years 2015 2100 the results are scaled for each significant flood risk area and for the whole of finland flood risk changes are described in terms of potentially affected residents and economic damage potential immaterial or indirect damages or effects caused by operations being suspended were not considered the effectiveness and profitability of different frm measures and strategies can be assessed on the basis of the calculated expected annual damages based on this assessment it was concluded that flood risks in finland are likely to multiply if frm measures are not implemented according to planning and without counteracting adaptation measures fig 3 31 in the short term frm should be adapted in response to the effects of population growth and the ageing of the population in flood risk areas in the long term it is also crucial to prepare for climate change but the regional differences are significant and need to be taken into account for some areas the flood risk may almost vanish due to the simultaneous strongly negative population trend and a decrease in flood hazard due to less snow accumulation in winter for other areas mainly the larger cities along the coast or large rivers flood risk is expected to increase in the future due to more rainfall and an increasing damage potential coastal floods most likely pose the largest flood risk in the future the life span of many structural flood risk measures is decades new land use and building permits may cause the damage potential to rise even for centuries consequently it is extremely difficult to predict future flood risks and the best ways to mitigate those 1 considering different scenarios to support the regional planning of flood proofing is a good starting point if used properly if flood risks are expected to increase in an area of significant flood risk the assessed increase should be taken into account when updating frmps and implementing measures however future scenarios cannot yet be recommended as starting point for planning in areas with a diminishing flood risk due to the uncertainties related to background factors and the slow and possibly non linear progress of change planning should therefore be based on a flood risk assessment that represents the current situation at the least as mentioned previously future flood risk assessments do not consider possible changes in the ability to adapt to flood risks land use planning or policy that is the reason why the assessments are planned to be updated every 6 12 years to support frm 4 procedure for climate proofing of flood risk management plans due to changes in climate as well as socioeconomic changes large uncertainties prevail in assessing impacts on water resources and flood risks according to ray and brown 34 two fundamental issues limit the use of climate scenarios to inform decision making lack of description of local hydrologic variability and extremes and lack of characterising the magnitude of climatic risks compared with other risks thus robustness based decision tools are needed to cope with these uncertainties the european commission s guidance on integrating climate change and biodiversity into environmental impact assessment european 8 encourages assessing baseline development trends drivers limit and threshold values using causal networks and identifying especially sensitive vulnerable areas in addition instead of snapshots the guideline stresses analysing long term trends knowledge on the impacts of climate change is of key importance when planning adaptation the first step according to calliari et al 2 is to assess how climate change affects the functioning of ecosystems next there should be an evaluation of how the performance of an action changes over a certain period and whether it still fulfils the original objectives in the future evans et al 12 considered different scenarios to establish what might happen to flood risk a long way in the future döll et al 5 propose a risk based approach that focuses on consequences instead of trying to better predict future weather conditions both maintain there is a need to integrate climate change into all parts of the planning process i e considering impacts and their uncertainty additionally climate change should be assessed in comparison to other pressures like land use and preferably water management should also contribute to climate change mitigation not only focus on adaptation 5 an appropriate time horizon for its assessment follows from the lifespan of the measure 48 if the lifetime is short like many campaigns to raise awareness it may be sufficient to evaluate the benefits at the baseline correspondingly measures whose lifespan extends over decades like building new dikes or buildings should be assessed against different hydrological and land use scenarios for many decades adaptive management helps to avoid under or over adaptation there are several assessment methods for assessing adaptation strategies under uncertainties e g robust decision making 26 real options analysis 50 and the adaptation pathways approach 16 additionally the six year planning cycles according to the eu floods directive and the eu water framework directive are based on the principle of adaptive management we developed our climate proofing framework on the basis of the approach of wilby and dessai 48 who proposed a scenario neutral adaptation method this is in line with front runner nations in europe on adaptive frm the united kingdom and the netherlands e g 12 20 in the uk by 2004 evans et al 11 had already recommended a shift to an integrated approach to flood risk management where frm should use a portfolio of measures whilst accepting future uncertainty and aiming to maintain flexibility e g 3 the environment agency 6 encourages risk management authorities to develop projects schemes and strategies that can be adapted to a range of future climate change scenarios the best known example is the thames estuary 2100 plan which was designed to be adaptable to different projections for climate change and sea level rise 7 the plan is reviewed and updated every 10 years the netherlands has a long tradition of flood risk management in the flood protection act of 1996 an adaptive planning cycle of five years was introduced changed to a six year cycle after the floods directive was implemented the delta program 2008 focuses on climate change adaptation and applies a risk approach for dealing with flood risk the prevailing principle is that the country should anticipate instead of respond to disasters maximise flexibility keep options open and avoid lock in 16 the delta program uses the adaptation pathways method and focuses on increasing system robustness especially when it comes to risk reduction and water robust planning 42 the starting point of our finnish framework is to reduce the vulnerability to climate variation adaptation is based on improving the capability of existing strategies to cope with change the key idea is to identify alternatives that are needed now and most likely useful in future circumstances to overcome uncertainty no low regret measures are given priority fig 4 in the first frm planning cycle the focus was on current flood risk and its management fig 4 for selecting the preferred measures costs benefits side effects and feasibility of potential measures were evaluated using for example a participatory multi criteria decision analysis approach 27 36 however changes in climate and land use were not included in the evaluation for the second cycle the european commission 10 suggested that all measures should be climate proofed the preferred measures mainly from the first planning cycle were then also re evaluated by their effect on future risks to ensure that they are robust or flexible the assessment should result in the prioritisation of robust measures an integral criterion for the planning of climate proofing is adaptability meaning that the plans are constantly being improved based on new evidence the assessment framework is intended to be used at strategic and planning level in preparation of regional frmps and to ensure that climate change is considered flood management groups or regional authorities are strongly suggested to score every measure and to include the scoring together with justifications in the frmps more detailed dimensioning of measures also regarding to climate change can be done later in the project planning stage the framework for climate proofing consists of three steps in each step the assessment uses a 5 step qualitative scale in step 1 it is evaluated how anticipated changes in conditions affect the performance of each measure compared with the baseline the 5 step scale is good no impact on the performance fairly good moderate not very good poor poor performance the measures are evaluated against several hydrological and land use change scenarios table 1 in step 2 the flexibility of each measure is assessed flexibility means the ability to be modified from a technical economic and or administrative point of view 50 it is especially necessary to assess the flexibility of measures that have a long 20 years life span the 5 step scale is very flexible quite flexible not very flexible not at all flexible difficult to assess it is recommended to justify the judgement e g by explaining how the changing climate or land use can be considered in the design or implementation of the measure or how to increase its flexibility in step 3 the overall score for each measure is derived from the combination of the robustness step 1 and flexibility step 2 of each measure fig 5 the overall score is not based on any weighting of the two criteria but is a subjective rating considering both climate proof measures could be robust meaning they perform under a variety of conditions or flexible so that they can be adapted or modified to changing conditions or both flexibility may compensate for shortcomings in robustness therefore a measure may reach a high score even if it performs well on one criterion only the framework thus relies on expert judgement allowing measure specific considerations this explains how a certain measure can be classified as being climate proof even if its robustness is not evaluated as good in all scenarios in step 1 or if it is inflexible but very robust the classes for the overall score are the following very climate proof the measure has good performance in changing conditions and or can be easily modified climate proof good performance in most conditions can be modified to some extent fairly climate proof fairly good performance in changing conditions can be limitedly modified not very climate proof does not perform well in all conditions not easy to modify not climate proof poor performance in changing conditions not flexible the evaluation framework and regionally specific data on changes were tested in three areas with fluvial flood risk and one with coastal flood risk and in two watersheds with authorities responsible for both frm and rbm planning the planners were asked to comment on the scenarios and the approach to presenting them as well as to share their experiences of using the evaluation tables the planners

20112,the water food energy wfe nexus is about balancing competing interests to secure the sustainability of services provided by interconnected sectors ignoring the interconnections could cause serious consequences for example eutrophication caused by overemphasizing on food production maximization could threaten water security worldwide eutrophication intensification is one of the most important causes of the lake water quality deteriorations water quality models are usually important decision making tools for policy makers this study attempts to explore the possibilities of applying the wfe nexus concept into water quality models we propose the most significant challenge is lack of a common modelling framework to streamline connections between up and downstream models as

algal blooms coastal hypoxia and dead zones 12 occurred in waterbodies but they are closely related with human activities in the catchment therefore it is acknowledged that water quality and resource management needs the efforts across systems across sectors and across disciplines 13 15 eutrophication is not a new topic but it is one of the most troubling water quality issues confronting human being in recent decades 16 eutrophication can seriously damage the functions of ecosystem services of waterbody on provisioning regulating and maintenance and cultural functions 17 it was estimated that the combined costs were 2 2 billion per year as a result of eutrophication in the us freshwaters 18 natural eutrophication occurs slowly in aquatic ecosystems but this process could be accelerated by human activities by several routes such as intensified nutrient discharges and global warming 3 19 since the 1990s water quality has deteriorated in many rivers and lakes in africa asia and latin america over 75 of closed waterbodies worldwide have experienced a certain degree of eutrophication 20 so far most of human mitigation measures are devoted to reduction of nutrient discharge into aquatic ecosystem e g building wwtps reducing fertilizer usages afforestation regardless of economic costs the mitigation measures seem to be successful in some lakes while fails in many other lakes 21 some other factors might also impact the occurrences of algal blooms e g climate changes a recent study indicated that lake warming might have counteracted the management effort to ameliorate lake eutrophication since the 1980s 2 eutrophication modeling has provided an important tool to assess the ecological status of lakes and pave the way to establish the sound management strategies in the eutrophication mitigation and water quality improvement these models were firstly developed in the 1970s well known as the vollenweider models and have been widely applied in the water management one primary goal of these models was to provide quantitative tools to predict the responses of lakes and reservoirs to nutrient discharge and provide quantitative nutrient reduction strategies 22 for many cases the nutrient loading was estimated by measured nutrient concentrations and runoffs in the in flow rivers 23 25 thus nexus between lake and watershed systems was weak and less quantified in most cases initially water quality model was simple and designed to characterize variations of in lake nutrients with changes of nutrient loadings 26 with continuous developments of numeric calculation capacities more spatial 1d 3d and temporal dynamics of hydrologic and ecological processes were incorporated into the eutrophication modeling 25 27 29 these progresses have helped to improve water quality management and set more appropriate control targets for the nutrient loadings by addressing challenge from water food and energy securities nexus approach towards resources management has been developed in the new frameworks of the un sustainable develop goals sdgs and initiated in the implementations main objectives of the nexus are to synthesize the individual systems of wfe and identify a coherent and harmonized way for the sustainable development of cross sectoral policies 30 in this brief review we firstly sketched out the current conditions and the drivers for lake eutrophication then we summarized applications advantages or limitations of eutrophication models which have been widely applied finally we analyzed the potential integrations between eutrophication modeling and the wfe nexus and proposed potential challenges and opportunities ahead 2 eutrophication and current conditions eutrophication is originated from the latin translation eu refers to well and trophe refers to the nourishment scientifically eutrophication is used to denote a process of nutrient enrichments from natural or anthropogenic sources and the subsequent changes in trophic states of waterbodies usually eutrophication could lead to the dramatic growths of phytoplankton and depleting oxygen due to algal decay from 1900s to 2000s the world population has increased from about 1700 to 7000 million synthetic fertilizer has played an irreplaceable role to support the growing populations 5 31 for instance before 1900s animal manure provided majority of phosphorus fertilizers after 2000s 80 of p fertilizer was contributed by phosphate rocks 17 million tons of p while only 3 million tons p are delivered to human diets 31 nitrogen n another essential element for human has similar patterns large volume of synthesized n fertilizer got lost during food production 5 artificially fixed n originated from haber bosch industrial production and agricultural fertilization is equivalent to n fixed from natural processes 32 one third of excessive n is transported from the lands to seas leading to severe eutrophication issues 33 34 lake eutrophication has become common nowadays as summarized in table 1 in usa median tp in lakes was about 37 μg l in 2012 but an unexpected increasing trend was observed from 2007 to 2012 with causes unclarified 35 in the european lakes median tp concentration was 23 μg l in 2018 36 now many european lakes are recovering from eutrophication following the controls of p inputs providing a paradigm of successful water managements 37 compared with developed countries lake nutrient monitoring in developing countries was usually performed in limited numbers of lakes and fragmented time periods 38 this might increase the uncertainties for scientific community to know the overall nutrient conditions in china a nation wide water nutrient monitoring network has been set up since 2005 which provides us a window to explore the temporal nutrient dynamics in the developing countries since the reform and opening in 1978 china has experienced a period of rapid economic development since the early 2000s many lakes and reservoirs have become eutrophic for instance in the lake taihu tp tn and chl a concentrations in 2006 were over 100 2000 and 50 μg l respectively 39 41 in the lake dianchi tp tn and chl a concentrations in 2006 were about 200 4000 and 40 μg l respectively 40 after the 2005 mitigation measures have been implemented to improve water quality in china the construction of wastewater treatment plants has grown rapidly in 2005 the percentage of municipal wastewater being treated on a national scale was only 40 while it had reached over 90 in 2017 42 43 nowadays over 5 000 wwtps in operation could treat over 60 109 m3 domestic wastewater which can largely reduce the nutrient discharges into waters an action aiming at reducing the fertilizer applications was also initiated in 2015 44 based on data set during 2006 2014 median tp concentrations declined from 80 3 247 μg l in 2006 to 51 3 128 μg l in 2014 on the national scale 4 similar trends had also occurred for other contaminants such as cod and nh4 n 45 3 how to model eutrophication in lakes in the past decades aquatic modeling has been developed by environmental scientists as important tools for water quality management a recent review of the development in eutrophication models for aquatic ecosystems pointed out the appealing diversity in this field and advocated for maintaining the diversity while called for the further efforts in standardization comparison and ensemble runs towards an interdisciplinary approach 46 some eutrophication models are simple and focused on changes of water qualities while other models could be far more complicated by coupling the hydro ecological dynamics eutrophication modeling for freshwater lakes and reservoirs started with the seminal work from vollenweider ran and lee 47 based on the regressions between lake tp and chl a concentration plankton biomass in lakes could be properly estimated 48 even nowadays these models or derived equations are also still very popular due to the simplicity in the simulations 49 after 1980s 2d 3d ecological models for lake eutrophication started to emerge in many countries these models were capable of simulating the physicochemical and biological processes in ecosystems through a series of equations 22 50 since the 1990s many process based models such as the aquatox caedym ce qual icm efdc and pclake have been developed and applied in various waterbodies table 2 compared to statistical models concerning the causal relationships as a black box the process based models need a theoretical and mechanistic understanding about in lake ecological processes the ordinary or partial differential equations are fundamental for simulations of the dynamic processes each model has its advantages and limitations as summarized by eleni et al 2017 22 for example caedym could simulate the grazing pressures from zooplankton to phytoplankton but it doesn t consider sediment diagenesis efdc may simulate high resolution variation of internal nutrient process but zooplankton and detritus are excluded and there is a high demand for input data pclake could simulate dynamics in the aquatic food chains but needs a detailed information for trophic structures for the model validations 38 a recent advance in this field is the general framework for aquatic biogeochemical models fabm 51 linking the multiple hydrodynamic from 1d to 3d and biogeochemical models e g fabm pclake 52 on the other hand our understanding about the detailed ecological processes in aquatic ecosystems is still advancing and the progresses will require further updates in the process based models a typical example is about the pattern of nutrient limitations in the lakes traditionally p limitation for phytoplankton is usually assumed in the lakes while recent studies reported that n might be more important for many other cases 21 the complex interactions between n and p limitation in aquatic environments are still on debate this suggests that differential dynamic equations would be necessary for different lake types 53 further process based models are usually more complicated than statistical methods modeling results need calibrations and validations against ideally high temporal resolution monitoring data these models had been developed and successfully applied in many lakes 22 38 and performed well in explaining limnology phenomenon 38 54 however these studies could only represent a small percentage of the lakes globally resulting in potential uncertainties between modeling performances and real conditions 38 nutrient loading and climate change are two key boundary conditions for the successful simulations of the process based models since they are primary drivers for algae blooms in the lakes 3 4 55 56 a better performance of process based models also asks for a high quality input data such as monthly or even daily resolution data and specific types of nutrients such as po4 3 p no3 n nh4 n for the lake ecosystems high quality nutrient loading data to model lake water quality is thus far still scare particularly in the developing countries 38 with development of automatic observation technology high temporal and spatial resolution nutrient or weather monitoring data could be increasingly accessible for instance china has set up a nation wide nutrient monitoring network in major rivers and lakes http mee gov cn information such as ph do tn tp and chl a can be updated every four hours similarly the daily weather information such as rainfall air temperature and radiation which is highly related to algae growth is also available http data cma cn this could provide lake the modelers an excellent opportunity to evaluate their results and improve the reliability of the modeling results however this practice may be difficult for the other developing countries to follow in the near future due to the costs and complexity of setting up a monitoring network 4 how to integrate eutrophication modeling in the wfe nexus now global community is facing unprecedented challenges that are directly linked to the way we currently understand and manage our resources wfe nexus framework and tool offers a framework for systematic integrations of interconnected sectors in the planning and decision making processes 57 wfe approach is central to sustainable development it is thus important to update current eutrophication modeling under wfe framework water quality issues occur in rivers or lakes but they are caused by human activity in watersheds mitigation measures aiming at improving the water quality are also closely connected to social development and human activity a good example to demonstrate the complicated linkages is as follows in order to reduce the nutrient inputs into the lakes reductions of fertilizer applications in the croplands are encouraged however reducing the fertilizer usages could save electricity largely since fertilizer production is a high energy consuming industry 5 ghgs such as co2 might favor the algae growths in the lakes 55 on the other hand reducing fertilizer application may also bring uncertainties in agricultural food productions it should be noted there is a clear division between the scientific communities focusing on nexus approaches e g data or social scientists and those whose major focus is on aquatic ecosystems e g limnologists for the current 3d dynamic water quality models there are three general categories of variables hydrologic variables e g water flow volume lake stratification environmental variables e g radiations temperatures nutrient loadings and biological variables e g planktons benthos 48 a variety of internal reactions are simulated in the lakes such as denitrification nitrification and mineralization reaction rate for internal processes was determined by the water chemistry variables related with reactions and water temperatures 24 25 58 janssen et al 2019 has proposed that an ideal algal projection model should include systems beyond the lakes as follows i environmental components e g land activity human discharge economic scenario ii network components e g hydrological process damming or river connectivity flow rate and iii aquatic ecosystem components e g internal process aquatic system structures 38 environmental component quantifies various natural and anthropogenic nutrient sources into river networks river network describes transports of water and nutrient into lakes lake ecosystem component simulates responses of water nutrients and algae growths to the climate changes and nutrient loadings 38 actually this ideal model has many potential interactions with the nexus framework fig 1 for example energy consumptions could produce ghgs and change climates affecting land nutrient transports in environment component hydrology processes in network component and aquatic structures in ecosystem component environmental scientists have already attempted to link eutrophication with the drivers in watersheds watershed models such as swat inca hspf and spaarow have been developed to simulate impacts of human activities economic scenarios and climate changes on watershed nutrient retentions or outputs 59 63 derived information could be applied as boundary conditions for eutrophication modeling several studies have been performed to connect the watershed model with eutrophication model for instance huang et al 2017 had coupled a xinanjiang model with efdc and estimated the effectiveness of watershed nutrient reductions in reducing algal blooms in the lake chao china 25 debele et al 2018 have integrated two powerful hydrological and water quality models swat and ce qual w2 to simulate combined processes of water quantity and quality both in the upland watershed and downstream waterbody their results indicate two models are compatible and could be applied to assess and manage water resources in complex watersheds comprised of upland watershed and downstream waterbodies 15 zhang et al 2012 presents a mwrms model to simulate hydrological and biogeochemical processes in small prairie watersheds another route to connect eutrophication modeling with the wfe nexus is climate changes climate change largely linked with energy consumption could influence lake eutrophication by changing non point nutrient inputs 64 changing hydrologic processes 65 and impacting algae growths 66 for example by introducing the miroc5 model of cmip5 tong et al 2020 has simulated impacts of lake warming scenarios on intensifying internal nutrient cycling in lakes and increased dominances of typical algae 67 by interpreting high resolution landsat 5 satellite imagery ho et al 2019 investigated long term trends in summer phytoplankton blooms for 71 large lakes and indicated lake warming might already be counteracting management efforts to ameliorate eutrophication 2 all these examples provide the evidences that eutrophication modeling could have different kinds of integrations with wfe approach although such attempts on integrations are only rudimentarily implemented and still rooted in eutrophication centered perspective it has been proposed that inclusion of the social ecological dynamics is one of the major improvements for the next generation aquatic ecosystem models in the anthropocene therefore integrated wfe nexus and eutrophication models serve as unique tools to grasp the interactions between human activities and environmental consequences a prospective strategy for such approach is to integrate the models addressing social ecological dynamics e g image gnm 68 and models tackling lake eutrophication e g pclake 54 the image gnm models simulates social ecological dynamics and synthesize the processes in human society e g agriculture industrial urbanization that could potentially generate excessive nutrient discharges and provides such external inputs as the major stressors to the lakes eutrophication models in turn quantify the response of the water quality evaluate the status of the lake ecosystems towards critical transitions and inform the stakeholders the reduction targets of nutrient loadings the stakeholders could assess the tradeoffs between social economic development and ecological health service and propose most effective lake management and restoration policies as indicated in fig 1 5 challenges in the integration and implications wef nexus consists of various disciplines which uses different research methodologies and inconsistent dimensions enhanced interaction between scientific communities working on nexus approach and ecosystem management should be encouraged firstly the stronger integrations with the watershed activities interactions between water quality and quantity dynamics and interactions with the global climate changes are making the integrations of eutrophication modeling into future nexus assessments increasingly feasible table 3 however we propose that following questions should be considered in advance for future integrations 5 1 what does eutrophication modeling provide to the wfe nexus wfe framework should take the eutrophication modeling as one important element the interdisciplinary nature of the wfe nexus requires that the framework should define the interfaces where eutrophication are affected or might have effects 69 the first step to integrate the eutrophication modeling into wfe nexus is to prove that the modeling result is useful in wfe framework so far most of eutrophication modeling targets at predicting temporal dynamics of water nutrients predicting occurrences of algal blooms and toxins and provide control target for nutrient loading these achievements could be important for the water quality managers or limnologists but are rarely admitted by the community from other disciplines it would be more valuable if the eutrophication modeling provides critical information for the other systems either as inputs or feedbacks a potential attempt could be connected with the changes of ecosystem services due to the eutrophication there is no doubt that eutrophication damages the ecological values of freshwaters it was estimated that the combined costs were about 2 2 billion annually as a result of eutrophication in the us freshwaters 18 this could be a useful output under the wfe nexus perspective however similar attempts have been quite limited so far 5 2 how to select a suitable model and smooth the input output data due to differences in disciplines multiple nexus modeling tools and methodologies have been developed to solve target nexus problem it can provide scientific communities the opportunities to pick up the suitable model however it will also make researchers puzzled when firstly stepping into the nexus approach 69 we admit that every nexus problem could be different but a common framework would be helpful to use the nexus approach based on general nexus framework a list of candidate models should be evaluated for each part of the nexus link currently there is no single model to simulate the entire wfe nexus 69 study of the entire wfe nexus is achieved through linking the multiple models with different functions thus a common data transfer protocol should be developed to link the different models the candidate models all have different input and output format different spatial and temporal resolutions it is important to make sure that the output from upstream model could meet the input requirement of the downstream models 5 3 how to assess the uncertainties for sub and entire systems uncertainties may propagate through the modeling chain from the subsystem to whole nexus 63 the process based eutrophication models could be assessed by the sensitivity analysis or validated by input and output data however under the nexus framework different models derived from different disciplines could have different methods to validate the results a clear and unified uncertainty for the whole system is essential to obtain the accurate and reliable results for the eutrophication models a validation with the historical monitoring data is common however for economic models uncertainties are evaluated by other means thus a unified method for the uncertainty analysis is highly necessary so that the outputs from different sub models could be compared in the systematic framework 6 conclusions lake eutrophication is an important water quality issue worldwide and it could seriously damage the ecosystem services variety of eutrophication modeling has been developed but it is rarely connected with the wfe nexus of course it may be not necessary to consider eutrophication modeling in all the nexus assessments wfe nexus is central to sustainable development it is thus important to update the current eutrophication modeling under the wfe nexus the coupled watershed lake modeling has provided us a good opportunity to apply the eutrophication modeling in the nexus approach however challenges still exist and it needs efforts from respective scientific communities across disciplines and sectors we envision lake eutrophication models will continuously gain interests and its integrations with wfe nexus could provide a valuable contribution to the watershed policymaking

20112,the water food energy wfe nexus is about balancing competing interests to secure the sustainability of services provided by interconnected sectors ignoring the interconnections could cause serious consequences for example eutrophication caused by overemphasizing on food production maximization could threaten water security worldwide eutrophication intensification is one of the most important causes of the lake water quality deteriorations water quality models are usually important decision making tools for policy makers this study attempts to explore the possibilities of applying the wfe nexus concept into water quality models we propose the most significant challenge is lack of a common modelling framework to streamline connections between up and downstream models as the most important water quality issue eutrophication modeling should increase its visibility in the united nations sustainable develop goals keywords lake eutrophication water quality modeling and management water energy food nexus sustainable development challenges in integrations 1 introduction a disturbed water food energy wfe dynamics could intensify the nutrient discharges from human

climate changes on watershed nutrient retentions or outputs 59 63 derived information could be applied as boundary conditions for eutrophication modeling several studies have been performed to connect the watershed model with eutrophication model for instance huang et al 2017 had coupled a xinanjiang model with efdc and estimated the effectiveness of watershed nutrient reductions in reducing algal blooms in the lake chao china 25 debele et al 2018 have integrated two powerful hydrological and water quality models swat and ce qual w2 to simulate combined processes of water quantity and quality both in the upland watershed and downstream waterbody their results indicate two models are compatible and could be applied to assess and manage water resources in complex watersheds comprised of upland watershed and downstream waterbodies 15 zhang et al 2012 presents a mwrms model to simulate hydrological and biogeochemical processes in small prairie watersheds another route to connect eutrophication modeling with the wfe nexus is climate changes climate change largely linked with energy consumption could influence lake eutrophication by changing non point nutrient inputs 64 changing hydrologic processes 65 and impacting algae growths 66 for example by introducing the miroc5 model of cmip5 tong et al 2020 has simulated impacts of lake warming scenarios on intensifying internal nutrient cycling in lakes and increased dominances of typical algae 67 by interpreting high resolution landsat 5 satellite imagery ho et al 2019 investigated long term trends in summer phytoplankton blooms for 71 large lakes and indicated lake warming might already be counteracting management efforts to ameliorate eutrophication 2 all these examples provide the evidences that eutrophication modeling could have different kinds of integrations with wfe approach although such attempts on integrations are only rudimentarily implemented and still rooted in eutrophication centered perspective it has been proposed that inclusion of the social ecological dynamics is one of the major improvements for the next generation aquatic ecosystem models in the anthropocene therefore integrated wfe nexus and eutrophication models serve as unique tools to grasp the interactions between human activities and environmental consequences a prospective strategy for such approach is to integrate the models addressing social ecological dynamics e g image gnm 68 and models tackling lake eutrophication e g pclake 54 the image gnm models simulates social ecological dynamics and synthesize the processes in human society e g agriculture industrial urbanization that could potentially generate excessive nutrient discharges and provides such external inputs as the major stressors to the lakes eutrophication models in turn quantify the response of the water quality evaluate the status of the lake ecosystems towards critical transitions and inform the stakeholders the reduction targets of nutrient loadings the stakeholders could assess the tradeoffs between social economic development and ecological health service and propose most effective lake management and restoration policies as indicated in fig 1 5 challenges in the integration and implications wef nexus consists of various disciplines which uses different research methodologies and inconsistent dimensions enhanced interaction between scientific communities working on nexus approach and ecosystem management should be encouraged firstly the stronger integrations with the watershed activities interactions between water quality and quantity dynamics and interactions with the global climate changes are making the integrations of eutrophication modeling into future nexus assessments increasingly feasible table 3 however we propose that following questions should be considered in advance for future integrations 5 1 what does eutrophication modeling provide to the wfe nexus wfe framework should take the eutrophication modeling as one important element the interdisciplinary nature of the wfe nexus requires that the framework should define the interfaces where eutrophication are affected or might have effects 69 the first step to integrate the eutrophication modeling into wfe nexus is to prove that the modeling result is useful in wfe framework so far most of eutrophication modeling targets at predicting temporal dynamics of water nutrients predicting occurrences of algal blooms and toxins and provide control target for nutrient loading these achievements could be important for the water quality managers or limnologists but are rarely admitted by the community from other disciplines it would be more valuable if the eutrophication modeling provides critical information for the other systems either as inputs or feedbacks a potential attempt could be connected with the changes of ecosystem services due to the eutrophication there is no doubt that eutrophication damages the ecological values of freshwaters it was estimated that the combined costs were about 2 2 billion annually as a result of eutrophication in the us freshwaters 18 this could be a useful output under the wfe nexus perspective however similar attempts have been quite limited so far 5 2 how to select a suitable model and smooth the input output data due to differences in disciplines multiple nexus modeling tools and methodologies have been developed to solve target nexus problem it can provide scientific communities the opportunities to pick up the suitable model however it will also make researchers puzzled when firstly stepping into the nexus approach 69 we admit that every nexus problem could be different but a common framework would be helpful to use the nexus approach based on general nexus framework a list of candidate models should be evaluated for each part of the nexus link currently there is no single model to simulate the entire wfe nexus 69 study of the entire wfe nexus is achieved through linking the multiple models with different functions thus a common data transfer protocol should be developed to link the different models the candidate models all have different input and output format different spatial and temporal resolutions it is important to make sure that the output from upstream model could meet the input requirement of the downstream models 5 3 how to assess the uncertainties for sub and entire systems uncertainties may propagate through the modeling chain from the subsystem to whole nexus 63 the process based eutrophication models could be assessed by the sensitivity analysis or validated by input and output data however under the nexus framework different models derived from different disciplines could have different methods to validate the results a clear and unified uncertainty for the whole system is essential to obtain the accurate and reliable results for the eutrophication models a validation with the historical monitoring data is common however for economic models uncertainties are evaluated by other means thus a unified method for the uncertainty analysis is highly necessary so that the outputs from different sub models could be compared in the systematic framework 6 conclusions lake eutrophication is an important water quality issue worldwide and it could seriously damage the ecosystem services variety of eutrophication modeling has been developed but it is rarely connected with the wfe nexus of course it may be not necessary to consider eutrophication modeling in all the nexus assessments wfe nexus is central to sustainable development it is thus important to update the current eutrophication modeling under the wfe nexus the coupled watershed lake modeling has provided us a good opportunity to apply the eutrophication modeling in the nexus approach however challenges still exist and it needs efforts from respective scientific communities across disciplines and sectors we envision lake eutrophication models will continuously gain interests and its integrations with wfe nexus could provide a valuable contribution to the watershed policymaking

20113,the himalayan glaciers partly cater to the water requirements of over a billion people living in the indus ganga and brahmaputra river basins climate change has affected most of these glaciers and has resulted in adverse societal impacts downstream several remote sensing and modelling studies have been developed to understand the recent evolution of glaciers and river runoff in these basins so far in situ glacio hydrological studies pivotal for calibration validation of the developed methods models are extremely sparse this review discusses the integrated monitoring of a reference glacier chhota shigri catchment western himalaya further it highlights the importance of such monitoring network for calibration validation of large scale glacio hydrological studies and proposes a catchment scale research strategy for sustainable management of future water resources in the himalayan rivers keywords himalaya cryosphere reference glacier catchment water security glacio hydrology 1 introduction the himalayan cryosphere aptly known as the third pole is among the most susceptible water towers on earth due to changing climate 1 himalayan glaciers act as buffer generally store snow in winters and release melt water in summer and partly satisfy the water needs for irrigation hydropower and local water supplies for more than a billion people living in the indus ganga and brahmaputra river basins 2 3 himalayan rivers are transboundary in nature where any volumetric or seasonal change in discharge may invite water oriented conflicts among neighbouring countries 2 4 therefore understanding the impact of climate change on the himalayan glaciers and river discharge is utmost required for sustainable and conciliatory management of the future water resources in the himalaya glaciers are also the best indicator of climate change as they are reactive to every minor change in local meteorological conditions himalayan glacierized regions cover an area of 40 000 km2 5 the gaffe eminent deglaciation of the himalayan glaciers by 2035 in ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change report in 2007 6 spotlighted the poor understanding about these glaciers hence several local and international scientific organizations started working to understand the impact of changing climate on the himalayan glaciers and water resources originating in these vast river basins recent rapid evolution in remote sensing methods availability of high resolution stereo pairs and release of declassified imageries from spy satellites provided a timely platform to estimate the geodetic mass balances and dynamics of the himalayan glaciers 2 3 7 9 the geodetic mass balance estimates are available at decadal scale hence cannot be used to understand the impact of climate at annual or seasonal scale 3 the glaciological in situ annual or seasonal mass balances required to understand the impact of climate change are available only for a few glaciers 3 both geodetic and glaciological methods showed that the himalayan glaciers are unanimously wasting their mass over the last 5 6 decades though the wastage rates are different in different ranges 3 5 on the contrary karakoram glaciers north west of the himalaya are either gaining stable or wasting their mass since at least 1970s resulting in a regional balanced state otherwise known as karakoram anomaly 3 5 7 different methods models have been applied to understand the impact of climate change on glaciers and thus runoff in the himalayan glacierized basins 2 3 in situ glacio hydrological data is extremely sparse in the himalaya 2 3 5 therefore most of the models used only river runoff data to calibrate validate the modelled runoffs 2 10 11 single data calibration method coupled with uncertain precipitation amounts in mountainous regions provide the serious equifinality issue in the modelled runoff 2 12 13 in such situation models are often forced to produce more glacier melt to match the observed river runoff 14 15 giving rise to unrealistic relative contribution of snow and glacier melt to total river runoff this paper presents i an in depth review of the integrated glacio hydrological monitoring on a reference glacier chhota shigri catchment in the western himalaya since 2002 ii importance of these measurements for the calibration validation of large scale remote sensing and glacio hydrological studies and iii a proposal on monitoring strategy for reference glacier catchments towards water security in the himalaya 2 study area and climatic conditions chhota shigri glacier csg is located in lahaul spiti valley of the western himalaya himachal pradesh india this is a medium sized almost clean glacier with an area of 15 5 km2 16 fig 1 csg is a valley type temperate and non surging glacier the lower ablation area 4500 m a s l is debris covered representing 3 4 of the total glacier area in 2005 17 the catchment area at discharge site 2 5 km downstream of csg snout is 34 7 km2 18 runoff from the catchment develops a proglacial stream that drains into the chandra river one of the tributaries of upper indus basin this is an easy to access glacier and can be reached from nearest city of manali by road lahaul spiti region falls in the monsoon arid transition zone and is affected by the indian summer monsoon ism during summer and the mid latitude western disturbances wds during winter at base camp ism provides 30 of annual precipitation while wds brings 70 of annual precipitation in winter confirming that csg is an accumulation type glacier 16 the mean annual temperature recorded at automatic weather station aws located at lateral moraine at 4863 m a s l was 5 4 c while the mean temperatures for summer jjas and winter djfm were 2 8 c and 12 9 c respectively over 2009 2019 19 3 integrated monitoring and available data sets on csg some preliminary glaciological studies were conducted on csg under a project sponsored by department of science and technology india during 1987 1989 20 after more than a decade the detailed monitoring on csg was started in autumn 2002 under an indo french collaboration 18 coupled with a field training workshop organized by the hindu kush himalaya unesco friend flow regimes from international experimental and network data program 21 the monitoring network on csg is tier 2 type as described by world glacier monitoring services wgms 22 since 2002 csg has been extensively studied by various organizations through in situ remote sensing and modelling approaches involving several aspects like meteorology mass balances energy balance dynamics ice thickness and catchment hydrology 15 20 23 33 in situ glacier mass balances were observed for part of the glacier below 5300 m a s l over 1987 1989 20 annual glacier wide mass balance monitoring on csg was started in october 2002 using classical glaciological method with a network of 22 25 ablation stakes and 5 6 pit coring accumulation measurements 18 seasonal glacier wide mass balance observations were started in may 2010 16 geodetic mass balances were also observed using different satellite products for different time periods since 1970s 16 17 23 29 34 35 long term glacier wide mass balances on csg were reconstructed using the temperature index based models for 1955 2014 30 and 1969 2016 periods 15 25 further glacier surface velocities were estimated using annual displacement of ablation stakes with differential global positioning system 18 the ice thickness measurements were also conducted using ground penetrating radar gpr survey on 5 transverse cross sections in the ablation area in october 2009 24 and on a longitudinal cross section over glacier tongue in september 2010 36 an automatic weather station aws m was installed in august 2009 on a lateral moraine 4863 m a s l fig 1 for the long term meteorological monitoring 25 while another aws g was erected on glacier surface at the middle of ablation area 4670 m a s l between 4 august 2012 and 4 october 2013 to understand the energy fluxes controlling the glacier mass balance 26 discharge measurements at csg catchment outlet were conducted between 2010 and 2016 during the ablation seasons may to september 15 19 the methodologies of all glacio hydro meteorological measurements can be found in the original references this integrated monitoring network unique in the whole himalaya provided a concrete background to understand the impacts of climate change on mass balance dynamics and hydrology of csg catchment fig 2 the mass wastage dynamic and hydrological changes and their responsible climatic drivers are reviewed and discussed in section 4 4 results review of integrated monitoring on csg 4 1 mass wastage the estimated mass balances on csg were collected from all available studies including in situ geodetic and models and reviewed here fig 3 table 1 in situ glaciological method showed a moderate wastage with a mean annual glacier wide mass balance of 0 43 0 40 m w e a 1 corresponding to cumulative mass loss of 7 82 m w e over 2002 2019 19 the mass balances were negative for 12 years while slightly positive for five years since 2002 fig 3a combining srtm and spot5 digital elevation models dems geodetic mass balance on csg was estimated to be 1 12 m w e a 1 using density assumption 1 and 1 02 m w e a 1 using density assumption 2 over 1999 2004 23 another study determined a modest mass wastage of 0 17 0 09 m w e a 1 with a cumulative mass balance of 3 8 2 0 m w e over 1988 2010 using in situ geodetic measurements 17 by srtm spot5 dems differencing 1999 2011 and in situ glaciological mass balance 2010 11 they estimated a mean mass wastage of 0 44 0 16 m w e a 1 over 1999 2010 further combining this wastage with in situ geodetic mass balance 0 17 0 09 m w e a 1 over 1988 2010 a slightly positive or near steady mass balance of 0 09 0 24 m w e a 1 was deduced over 1988 1999 in agreement a recent study 32 using corona srtm dems estimated the long term near steady state of csg over 1971 1999 with a mean balance of 0 03 0 10 m w e a 1 they further estimated a moderate mass wastage of 0 24 0 10 m w e a 1 over 2000 2011 by differencing srtm cartosat dems brun et al 7 estimated similar mean wastage of 0 23 0 28 m w e a 1 over 2005 2014 using spot5 pléiades dems and 0 27 0 13 m w e a 1 using aster dems over the same period however another study estimated higher mass wastage of 0 46 0 34 m w e a 1 using srtm and tandem x data over 2000 2012 34 which agrees with vincent et al 17 the reconstructed long term mean annual glacier wide mass balance by a temperature index based glacio hydrological model was 0 30 0 36 m w e a 1 over 1969 2016 15 25 another modelling study extended the mass balance reconstruction back in time and estimated the similar mean annual glacier wide mass balance of 0 36 0 33 m w e a 1 over 1955 2014 30 in line with proposed steady state over 1990s 17 an energy balance model reconstructed the annual glacier wide mass balance on csg as 0 16 0 38 m w e a 1 over 1989 2016 33 another study developed an albedo mass balance model and reconstructed a higher annual mass wastage of 0 68 0 10 m w e a 1 over 2000 2013 29 the annual mass balances available from all models and glaciological method over common period of 1990 2016 show good agreement with each other table 1 the mass balances on csg from different approaches show some differences which could be due to different methods observation period etc however the observed values are within the uncertainty bounds table 1 using all the available mass balances annual glaciological and modelled and mean annual geodetic mean annual mass balance for each year as well as decadal mass balances were estimated between 1955 and 2019 fig 3 csg showed a moderate mass wastage with a mean annual mass balance standard deviation of 0 25 0 35 m w e a 1 equivalent to a cumulative wastage of 16 55 m w e over 1955 2019 the decadal mass balances were moderately negative over 1955 1989 0 21 0 45 m w e a 1 and 2010 2019 0 28 0 43 m w e a 1 highly negative over 2000 2009 0 56 0 43 m w e a 1 and near steady state over 1990 1999 0 10 0 31 m w e a 1 fig 3 table 1 near steady state on csg over 1990s was already suggested by an ice flux analysis 24 similar near steady state of mass balances over 1990s was also observed on mera and dokriani glaciers in the central himalaya in the long term mass balance modelling studies 14 37 positive precipitation and negative temperature anomalies over 1990s were suggested to be the reason for near steady state of these glaciers 14 25 37 the post 2000 accelerated wastage is in agreement with the recent regional studies 3 38 given that the original studies are having high uncertainties as well as calculated mean and decadal mass balances are having high standard deviations table 1 a high cautiousness is required while using the computed mean and decadal mass balances on csg 4 2 glacier dynamics any change in glacier s mass influences its dynamics 9 therefore with the observed mass wastage on csg section 4 1 an adjustment in its dynamics is expected glacier dynamic fluctuations involve changes in glacier velocity and glacier thickness csg has been observed intermittently for its surface velocity since 1987 18 20 ice flow velocities on ablation area of csg showed negligible changes between 1987 and 2003 in agreement to suggested steady sate of mass balance over 1990s 24 however as a response of post 2000 accelerated glacier wastage ice flow velocities and surface elevation slowly decreased in the ablation area between 2003 and 2010 indicating a 24 37 reduction in ice fluxes 24 surface velocities were further found to be decreasing till 2016 due to continued wastage 19 4 3 catchment hydrology in situ hydrological measurements were performed during summer months may to september over 2010 2016 using the area velocity method at a gauging site about 2 km downstream of the csg terminus 15 the access to the catchment is subjected to the road clearance road remained closed due to snow avalanches landslides therefore the discharge observations were not always available for the whole summer period july august made up more than 80 of the discharge in agreement with the warmest temperatures in these months 19 long term runoff were reconstructed using simple temperature index models over 1955 2014 30 and 1969 2016 15 periods both the studies used the in situ discharge data for their model calibration a detailed comparison suggested that the modelled runoffs from engelhardt et al 30 were slightly higher than azam et al 15 corresponding to a higher mass turn over although input precipitation data source was different azam et al 15 used valley precipitation data while engelhardt et al 30 used rcms but due to steep topography and presence of orographic barrier at the head of csg it was difficult to conclude the climatic reasons for higher runoff from engelhardt et al 30 fig 4 represents the mean monthly cumulative runoff bars for glacier ice melt snow melt and rainfall runoff computed at the catchment outlet 15 the mean annual catchment wide runoff was computed as 1 56 0 23 m w e a 1 over 1969 2016 the runoff contribution was negligible 0 01 m w e a 1 in winter november april and almost all the runoff was generated in summer may october months snow melt in early summer april onset the runoff generation and peaked in july august this resulted in migration of snow line to higher elevations leaving the glacier ice exposed to melt hence ice melt progressively increased and showed maximum ice melt in august monsoonal rainfall occurred over june through september with maximum contribution in july august as a result of high snow melt highest ice melt and maximum rainfall the total runoff attained peak in august fig 4 at catchment scale snow melt contributed the maximum with a share of 63 while ice melt and rainfall contributed 17 and 20 to the total runoff during the whole modelling period 15 4 4 climatic drivers for mass balance and hydrology precipitation and temperature are often considered the main drivers responsible for accumulation and melt of glacier and snow and runoff generation from a catchment still explicit calculation of the surface energy balance seb can identify the factors that control glacier and snow melt and provides the insights into the functioning of glacierized catchments using the long term temperature index modelling results over 1969 2012 summer temperature and winter precipitation were suggested to be the equally important drivers controlling the mass balances on csg 25 further a detailed seb model was developed using aws g data section 3 that suggested a critical role of summer monsoon snowfall events for mass balances 26 the intensity of summer monsoon snowfalls notably affects surface albedo melting is reduced in case of heavier snowfalls and control the summer mass balance hence the annual mass balance this phenomenon was also noticed with the limited field observed data on csg 16 19 as well as in some large scale studies covering the whole himalaya 39 recently the critical role of summer monsoon snowfalls by limiting the summer melting was also highlighted for runoff generation from csg catchment 15 the summer monsoon air temperature deciding the precipitation phase snow versus rainfall hence surface albedo was indirectly also among the most important drivers for mass balance and runoff generation in csg catchment 5 discussion 5 1 regional representativeness of csg each glacier has its own topographic set up debris cover accumulation vs ablation area altitudinal range valley aspect presence of thermokarst features etc and micrometeorology therefore mass balances may be different on different glaciers under the same regional climatic conditions there are only 7 glaciers with more than 5 years of glaciological mass balance observations where measurements are presently continue in the himalaya 3 among them the regional representativeness has been discussed only for csg 17 40 here the representativeness of csg with recently developed datasets table 1 fig 2 is further investigated geodetic mass balance of 0 39 0 15 m w e a 1 on csg over 1999 2011 was found to be statistically similar to the regional mass balance of 0 44 0 09 m w e a 1 of all glaciers 2100 km2 in the lahaul spiti region over the same period 17 moreover cumulative glaciological mass balance on csg was also in good agreement with the regional a 2 n 2 e cell centred around the csg icesat derived cumulative mass balance wastage over 2003 2008 41 recently a regional study covering the whole high mountain asia estimated the geodetic mass balances for the lahaul spiti region as 0 49 0 22 m w e a 1 and 0 11 0 19 m w e a 1 over 2000 2008 and 2009 2016 respectively 7 the reduced wastage after 2008 over the whole lahaul spiti region is in good agreement with the observed in situ mass wastage on csg 19 where the glaciological mass balance was much less negative with a value of 0 17 0 40 m w e a 1 over 2009 2019 compared to 0 99 0 40 m w e a 1 over 2002 2008 fig 3a therefore it can be concluded that the representativeness of csg for the whole lahaul spiti region as previously suggested over 1999 2011 17 is also continuing after 2011 5 2 importance of integrated monitoring on csg in order to highlight the importance of integrated monitoring on a reference glacier catchment a thorough compilation of all the available studies developed on csg was done a total of 63 studies including grey literature as well as non peer reviewed papers were found on google search a four level screening was then applied in order to select the most important studies in the field of glacio hydrology fig 5 a and finally 14 studies were selected to showcase the importance of integrated monitoring on csg catchment for the glacio hydrology of the himalaya fig 5b table 2 these screened studies were categorized in three categories based on their main focuses i e in situ remote sensing and modelling studies about hydrochemistry isotopes sediments geo morphology and reviews were intentionally excluded because the present review focuses mainly on glacio hydrology dobhal et al 1995 20 is the oldest study while azam et al 2019 15 is the latest study among them out of 14 studies in situ remote sensing modelling studies are 5 3 and 6 respectively all together these studies have a total 972 citations equivalent to 11 citation per paper per year on google scholar on 25 november 2020 this high annual citation value clearly indicates the crucial importance of integrated monitoring developed on csg for the himalayan glacio hydrology some of the important uses of the developed studies on csg catchment for other regional scale studies are being highlighted hereafter in situ glacier wide mass balances have been used to validate several satellite estimates 17 23 as well as to calibrate validate several modelling studies 25 26 30 kumar et al 33 modelled the mass balance of all the himalayan glaciers and validated their results using in situ mass balances on chhota shigri and mera glaciers 41 geodetic mass balances from vincent et al 17 together with in situ mass balances 24 were used to calibrate a glacio hydrological model that estimated the mass balances and runoffs from csg catchment over 1969 2016 15 further several studies 17 23 34 35 compared the in situ and geodetic mass balances on csg with the regional mass balance of the whole lahaul spiti region and educed the regional representativeness of csg for the whole lahaul spiti region 2100 km2 glacierized area section 5 1 ice thickness data from gpr measurements on csg 24 has been extensively used to calibrate the ice thickness and volume models at glacier scale 31 43 covering the whole himalaya 44 as well as in some global studies 45 recently ice thickness models intercomparison experiment phase 2 also used ice thickness and velocity data from csg 46 47 moreover ice thickness data was also used to calibrate the glabtop2 glacier bed topography model version 2 model developed to investigate the glacier bed overdeepenings for 28 000 glaciers in the whole himalaya 44 most of the glacio hydrological modelling studies in the himalaya have been developed applying the temperature index approach 11 15 37 in which melting is generated as a function of positive air temperature using the melt factors 48 melt factors for snow ice and debris covered ice developed using the field data on csg 26 have also been used in several modelling studies shea et al 37 modelled the glacier changes in the everest region nepal between 1961 and 2007 through starting their model calibration with the melt factors obtained on csg 26 recently another study modelled the mass balances of siachen glacier largest glacier in india over 1986 2018 exploiting the melt factors information on csg 49 stream discharge data was also used for calibration of glacio hydrological models developed for csg 15 30 5 3 proposed research strategy wgms suggested a multilevel glacier monitoring strategy global hierarchical observing strategy including tiers 1 5 22 these are quickly briefed here tier 1 development of integrated experimental sites with a focus on process based understanding of interactions feedbacks between different variables snow glaciers permafrost hydrology soils green cover etc tier 2 long term process based annual seasonal mass balance monitoring within major climatic zones for calibration validation of numerical models tier 3 glacier mass balance estimation in major mountain systems using reduced number of stakes tier 4 long term length change measurements and tier 5 upgradation of glacier inventories at 5 10 years of time step for comparative studies integrated monitoring on csg has been developed following tier 2 guidelines section 3 the crucial importance of csg catchment monitoring for the himalayan glacio hydrology is clearly evident through high citations of the screened studies section 5 2 here these screened studies are further investigated and their citations are categorized in i field based ii remote sensing iii modelling and iv other studies other category includes all studies having focus other than glacio hydrology the distribution of citations for each study is displayed through a chord diagram fig 6 a in general each screened study whether field based remote sensing or model based on csg received citations by field based remote sensing or modelling studies fig 6a that shows how different approaches are interconnected further field based studies on csg have been extensively used in remote sensing and modelling studies fig 6a that shows the general scarcity of in situ data in the himalaya while highlighting the importance of field based studies for regional remote sensing and modelling studies as discussed in section 5 2 in order to understand the impact of climate change on glaciers and thus on melt dependent river hydrology long term monitoring of glacier catchments is required which is scarce for the himalaya 2 3 geodetic mass estimates partially fill this gap for glaciers as they can provide long term mean mass balance estimates in past but a clear picture of climate glacier runoff linkages 2 3 glacio hydrological modelling can also bridge the gap however models need to be carefully calibrated using plenty of in situ and remote sensing data to provide reliable results 13 15 37 considering these points and interconnectivity of different studies fig 6a as well as discussed importance of integrated monitoring on csg catchment section 5 2 it is hereby proposed to develop catchment scale integrated monitoring of glaciers combining and exploiting together the in situ remote sensing and modelling approaches as shown in the himalayan cryosphere triangle hct fig 6b indeed monitoring is not possible for much of the glacier catchments however similar to csg catchment some more reference glacier catchments should be carefully selected from different climatic regimes along the himalayan range for long term glacier mass balance energy balance dynamic and hydrological studies following the wgms tier 2 guidelines as well as proposed integrated monitoring under hct research strategy 6 conclusion all the studies including in situ geodetic and modelling suggest a long term mean mass wastage on csg the mean mass wastage using all available studies was calculated as 0 25 0 35 m w e a 1 over 1955 2019 period showing a moderate mass loss csg showed a near steady state over 1990 s before entering to a higher mass wastage during first decade of the 21st century and then again slightly less mass wastage after 2010 the in situ geodetic and modelled mass balances on csg were found to be similar to mean mass balances of all glaciers in the whole lahaul spiti 2100 km2 region confirming its regional representativeness as a response to near steady state mass balance over 1990s and subsequent post 2000 mass wastage on csg the surface velocities were also in balance over 1990s and have been reducing since 2000 csg catchment hydrology is dominated by the snow melt 63 followed by almost equal contributions from ice melt and rainfall runoff the mass balance and catchment hydrology of csg are mainly controlled by summer monsoon snowfalls air temperature while deciding the precipitation phase also plays an indirect yet important role for the functioning of csg catchment in order to understand the importance of integrated monitoring on csg catchment for the glacio hydrology of the himalaya all the studies available on csg were compiled and 14 studies were shortlisted applying a four level screening these studies in situ remote sensing or model received high citations 11 per year per paper at google scholar generally screened studies received citations by field based remote sensing as well as modelling studies indicating the interconnectivity of different approaches further they have been extensively used to validate the remote sensing products as well as to calibrate validate the glacio hydrological models presently such monitoring networks are extremely limited in the himalaya therefore the calibration of large scale glacio hydrological models covering the entire himalaya has often been done using the limited in situ glaciological data or observed river discharge data far below from glaciers considering the importance of integrated monitoring on csg catchment it is proposed to select more reference glacier catchments from different climatic regimes in the himalaya for long term glaciological studies following the wgms tier 2 guidelines and applying the in situ remote sensing and model approaches following hct research strategy fortunately similar to csg a few studies are growing on mera khumbu nepal yala langtang nepal and chorabari garhwal india glaciers 2 3 42 49 but several regions such as karakoram zanskar sikkim himalaya bhutan are yet unexplored 2 therefore selection of more reference glacier catchments is highly recommended to develop a coherent picture of the climate glacier river runoff relationship in the himalayan region as a timely step to ensure water security in future an improved understanding of the himalayan cryosphere is also necessary to understand the increased frequency and magnitude of

20113,the himalayan glaciers partly cater to the water requirements of over a billion people living in the indus ganga and brahmaputra river basins climate change has affected most of these glaciers and has resulted in adverse societal impacts downstream several remote sensing and modelling studies have been developed to understand the recent evolution of glaciers and river runoff in these basins so far in situ glacio hydrological studies pivotal for calibration validation of the developed methods models are extremely sparse this review discusses the integrated monitoring of a reference glacier chhota shigri catchment western himalaya further it highlights the importance of such monitoring network for calibration validation of large scale glacio hydrological studies and proposes a catchment scale research strategy for sustainable management of future water resources in the himalayan rivers keywords himalaya cryosphere reference glacier catchment water security glacio hydrology 1 introduction the himalayan cryosphere aptly known as the third pole is among the most susceptible water towers on earth due to changing climate 1 himalayan glaciers act as buffer generally store snow in winters and release melt water in summer and partly satisfy the water needs for irrigation hydropower and local water supplies for more than a billion people living in the indus ganga and brahmaputra river basins 2 3 himalayan rivers are transboundary in nature where any volumetric or seasonal change in discharge may invite water oriented conflicts among neighbouring countries 2 4 therefore understanding the impact of climate change on the himalayan glaciers and river discharge is utmost required for sustainable and conciliatory management of the future water resources in the himalaya glaciers are also the best indicator of climate change as they are reactive to every minor change in local meteorological conditions himalayan glacierized regions cover an area of 40 000 km2 5 the gaffe eminent deglaciation of the himalayan glaciers by 2035 in ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change report in 2007 6 spotlighted the poor understanding about these glaciers hence several local and international scientific organizations started working to understand the impact of changing climate on the himalayan glaciers and water resources originating in these vast river basins recent rapid evolution in remote sensing methods availability of high resolution stereo pairs and release of declassified imageries from spy satellites provided a timely platform to estimate the geodetic mass balances and dynamics of the himalayan glaciers 2 3 7 9 the geodetic mass balance estimates are available at decadal scale hence cannot be used to understand the impact of climate at annual or seasonal scale 3 the glaciological in situ annual or seasonal mass balances required to understand the impact of climate change are available only for a few glaciers 3 both geodetic and glaciological methods showed that the himalayan glaciers are unanimously wasting their mass over the last 5 6 decades though the wastage rates are different in different ranges 3 5 on the contrary karakoram glaciers north west of the himalaya are either gaining stable or wasting their mass since at least 1970s resulting in a regional balanced state otherwise known as karakoram anomaly 3 5 7 different methods models have been applied to understand the impact of climate change on glaciers and thus runoff in the himalayan glacierized basins 2 3 in situ glacio hydrological data is extremely sparse in the himalaya 2 3 5 therefore most of the models used only river runoff data to calibrate validate the modelled runoffs 2 10 11 single data calibration method coupled with uncertain precipitation amounts in mountainous regions provide the serious equifinality issue in the modelled runoff 2 12 13 in such situation models are often forced to produce more glacier melt to match the observed river runoff 14 15 giving rise to unrealistic relative contribution of snow and glacier melt to total river runoff this paper presents i an in depth review of the integrated glacio hydrological monitoring on a reference glacier chhota shigri catchment in the western himalaya since 2002 ii importance of these measurements for the calibration validation of large scale remote sensing and glacio hydrological studies and iii a proposal on monitoring strategy for reference glacier catchments towards water security in the himalaya 2 study area and climatic conditions chhota shigri glacier csg is located in lahaul spiti valley of the western himalaya himachal pradesh india this is a medium sized almost clean glacier with an area of 15 5 km2 16 fig 1 csg is a valley type temperate and non surging glacier the lower ablation area 4500 m a s l is debris covered representing 3 4 of the total glacier area in 2005 17 the catchment area at discharge site 2 5 km downstream of csg snout is 34 7 km2 18 runoff from the catchment develops a proglacial stream that drains into the chandra river one of the tributaries of upper indus basin this is an easy to access glacier and can be reached from nearest city of manali by road lahaul spiti region falls in the monsoon arid transition zone and is affected by the indian summer monsoon ism during summer and the mid latitude western disturbances wds during winter at base camp ism provides 30 of annual precipitation while wds brings 70 of annual precipitation in winter confirming that csg is an accumulation type glacier 16 the mean annual temperature recorded at automatic weather station aws located at lateral moraine at 4863 m a s l was 5 4 c while the mean temperatures for summer jjas and winter djfm were 2 8 c and 12 9 c respectively over 2009 2019 19 3 integrated monitoring and available data sets on csg some preliminary glaciological studies were conducted on csg under a project sponsored by department of science and technology india during 1987 1989 20 after more than a decade the detailed monitoring on csg was started in autumn 2002 under an indo french collaboration 18 coupled with a field training workshop organized by the hindu kush himalaya unesco friend flow regimes from international experimental and network data program 21 the monitoring network on csg is tier 2 type as described by world glacier monitoring services wgms 22 since 2002 csg has been extensively studied by various organizations through in situ remote sensing and modelling approaches involving several aspects like meteorology mass balances energy balance dynamics ice thickness and catchment hydrology 15 20 23 33 in situ glacier mass balances were observed for part of the glacier below 5300 m a s l over 1987 1989 20 annual glacier wide mass balance monitoring on csg was started in october 2002 using classical glaciological method with a network of 22 25 ablation stakes and 5 6 pit coring accumulation measurements 18 seasonal glacier wide mass balance observations were started in may 2010 16 geodetic mass balances were also observed using different satellite products for different time periods since 1970s 16 17 23 29 34 35 long term glacier wide mass balances on csg were reconstructed using the temperature index based models for 1955 2014 30 and 1969 2016 periods 15 25 further glacier surface velocities were estimated using annual displacement of ablation stakes with differential global positioning system 18 the ice thickness measurements were also conducted using ground penetrating radar gpr survey on 5 transverse cross sections in the ablation area in october 2009 24 and on a longitudinal cross section over glacier tongue in september 2010 36 an automatic weather station aws m was installed in august 2009 on a lateral moraine 4863 m a s l fig 1 for the long term meteorological monitoring 25 while another aws g was erected on glacier surface at the middle of ablation area 4670 m a s l between 4 august 2012 and 4 october 2013 to understand the energy fluxes controlling the glacier mass balance 26 discharge measurements at csg catchment outlet were conducted between 2010 and 2016 during the ablation seasons may to september 15 19 the methodologies of all glacio hydro meteorological measurements can be found in the original references this integrated monitoring network unique in the whole himalaya provided a concrete background to understand the impacts of climate change on mass balance dynamics and hydrology of csg catchment fig 2 the mass wastage dynamic and hydrological changes and their responsible climatic drivers are reviewed and discussed in section 4 4 results review of integrated monitoring on csg 4 1 mass wastage the estimated mass balances on csg were collected from all available studies including in situ geodetic and models and reviewed here fig 3 table 1 in situ glaciological method showed a moderate wastage with a mean annual glacier wide mass balance of 0 43 0 40 m w e a 1 corresponding to cumulative mass loss of 7 82 m w e over 2002 2019 19 the mass balances were negative for 12 years while slightly positive for five years since 2002 fig 3a combining srtm and spot5 digital elevation models dems geodetic mass balance on csg was estimated to be 1 12 m w e a 1 using density assumption 1 and 1 02 m w e a 1 using density assumption 2 over 1999 2004 23 another study determined a modest mass wastage of 0 17 0 09 m w e a 1 with a cumulative mass balance of 3 8 2 0 m w e over 1988 2010 using in situ geodetic measurements 17 by srtm spot5 dems differencing 1999 2011 and in situ glaciological mass balance 2010 11 they estimated a mean mass wastage of 0 44 0 16 m w e a 1 over 1999 2010 further combining this wastage with in situ geodetic mass balance 0 17 0 09 m w e a 1 over 1988 2010 a slightly positive or near steady mass balance of 0 09 0 24 m w e a 1 was deduced over 1988 1999 in agreement a recent study 32 using corona srtm dems estimated the long term near steady state of csg over 1971 1999 with a mean balance of 0 03 0 10 m w e a 1 they further estimated a moderate mass wastage of 0 24 0 10 m w e a 1 over 2000 2011 by differencing srtm cartosat dems brun et al 7 estimated similar mean wastage of 0 23 0 28 m w e a 1 over 2005 2014 using spot5 pléiades dems and 0 27 0 13 m w e a 1 using aster dems over the same period however another study estimated higher mass wastage of 0 46 0 34 m w e a 1 using srtm and tandem x data over 2000 2012 34 which agrees with vincent et al 17 the reconstructed long term mean annual glacier wide mass balance by a temperature index based glacio hydrological model was 0 30 0 36 m w e a 1 over 1969 2016 15 25 another modelling study extended the mass balance reconstruction back in time and estimated the similar mean annual glacier wide mass balance of 0 36 0 33 m w e a 1 over 1955 2014 30 in line with proposed steady state over 1990s 17 an energy balance model reconstructed the annual glacier wide mass balance on csg as 0 16 0 38 m w e a 1 over 1989 2016 33 another study developed an albedo mass balance model and reconstructed a higher annual mass wastage of 0 68 0 10 m w e a 1 over 2000 2013 29 the annual mass balances available from all models and glaciological method over common period of 1990 2016 show good agreement with each other table 1 the mass balances on csg from different approaches show some differences which could be due to different methods observation period etc however the observed values are within the uncertainty bounds table 1 using all the available mass balances annual glaciological and modelled and mean annual geodetic mean annual mass balance for each year as well as decadal mass balances were estimated between 1955 and 2019 fig 3 csg showed a moderate mass wastage with a mean annual mass balance standard deviation of 0 25 0 35 m w e a 1 equivalent to a cumulative wastage of 16 55 m w e over 1955 2019 the decadal mass balances were moderately negative over 1955 1989 0 21 0 45 m w e a 1 and 2010 2019 0 28 0 43 m w e a 1 highly negative over 2000 2009 0 56 0 43 m w e a 1 and near steady state over 1990 1999 0 10 0 31 m w e a 1 fig 3 table 1 near steady state on csg over 1990s was already suggested by an ice flux analysis 24 similar near steady state of mass balances over 1990s was also observed on mera and dokriani glaciers in the central himalaya in the long term mass balance modelling studies 14 37 positive precipitation and negative temperature anomalies over 1990s were suggested to be the reason for near steady state of these glaciers 14 25 37 the post 2000 accelerated wastage is in agreement with the recent regional studies 3 38 given that the original studies are having high uncertainties as well as calculated mean and decadal mass balances are having high standard deviations table 1 a high cautiousness is required while using the computed mean and decadal mass balances on csg 4 2 glacier dynamics any change in glacier s mass influences its dynamics 9 therefore with the observed mass wastage on csg section 4 1 an adjustment in its dynamics is expected glacier dynamic fluctuations involve changes in glacier velocity and glacier thickness csg has been observed intermittently for its surface velocity since 1987 18 20 ice flow velocities on ablation area of csg showed negligible changes between 1987 and 2003 in agreement to suggested steady sate of mass balance over 1990s 24 however as a response of post 2000 accelerated glacier wastage ice flow velocities and surface elevation slowly decreased in the ablation area between 2003 and 2010 indicating a 24 37 reduction in ice fluxes 24 surface velocities were further found to be decreasing till 2016 due to continued wastage 19 4 3 catchment hydrology in situ hydrological measurements were performed during summer months may to september over 2010 2016 using the area velocity method at a gauging site about 2 km downstream of the csg terminus 15 the access to the catchment is subjected to the road clearance road remained closed due to snow avalanches landslides therefore the discharge observations were not always available for the whole summer period july august made up more than 80 of the discharge in agreement with the warmest temperatures in these months 19 long term runoff were reconstructed using simple temperature index models over 1955 2014 30 and 1969 2016 15 periods both the studies used the in situ discharge data for their model calibration a detailed comparison suggested that the modelled runoffs from engelhardt et al 30 were slightly higher than azam et al 15 corresponding to a higher mass turn over although input precipitation data source was different azam et al 15 used valley precipitation data while engelhardt et al 30 used rcms but due to steep topography and presence of orographic barrier at the head of csg it was difficult to conclude the climatic reasons for higher runoff from engelhardt et al 30 fig 4 represents the mean monthly cumulative runoff bars for glacier ice melt snow melt and rainfall runoff computed at the catchment outlet 15 the mean annual catchment wide runoff was computed as 1 56 0 23 m w e a 1 over 1969 2016 the runoff contribution was negligible 0 01 m w e a 1 in winter november april and almost all the runoff was generated in summer may october months snow melt in early summer april onset the runoff generation and peaked in july august this resulted in migration of snow line to higher elevations leaving the glacier ice exposed to melt hence ice melt progressively increased and showed maximum ice melt in august monsoonal rainfall occurred over june through september with maximum contribution in july august as a result of high snow melt highest ice melt and maximum rainfall the total runoff attained peak in august fig 4 at catchment scale snow melt contributed the maximum with a share of 63 while ice melt and rainfall contributed 17 and 20 to the total runoff during the whole modelling period 15 4 4 climatic drivers for mass balance and hydrology precipitation and temperature are often considered the main drivers responsible for accumulation and melt of glacier and snow and runoff generation from a catchment still explicit calculation of the surface energy balance seb can identify the factors that control glacier and snow melt and provides the insights into the functioning of glacierized catchments using the long term temperature index modelling results over 1969 2012 summer temperature and winter precipitation were suggested to be the equally important drivers controlling the mass balances on csg 25 further a detailed seb model was developed using aws g data section 3 that suggested a critical role of summer monsoon snowfall events for mass balances 26 the intensity of summer monsoon snowfalls notably affects surface albedo melting is reduced in case of heavier snowfalls and control the summer mass balance hence the annual mass balance this phenomenon was also noticed with the limited field observed data on csg 16 19 as well as in some large scale studies covering the whole himalaya 39 recently the critical role of summer monsoon snowfalls by limiting the summer melting was also highlighted for runoff generation from csg catchment 15 the summer monsoon air temperature deciding the precipitation phase snow versus rainfall hence surface albedo was indirectly also among the most important drivers for mass balance and runoff generation in csg catchment 5 discussion 5 1 regional representativeness of csg each glacier has its own topographic set up debris cover accumulation vs ablation area altitudinal range valley aspect presence of thermokarst features etc and micrometeorology therefore mass balances may be different on different glaciers under the same regional climatic conditions there are only 7 glaciers with more than 5 years of glaciological mass balance observations where measurements are presently continue in the himalaya 3 among them the regional representativeness has been discussed only for csg 17 40 here the representativeness of csg with recently developed datasets table 1 fig 2 is further investigated geodetic mass balance of 0 39 0 15 m w e a 1 on csg over 1999 2011 was found to be statistically similar to the regional mass balance of 0 44 0 09 m w e a 1 of all glaciers 2100 km2 in the lahaul spiti region over the same period 17 moreover cumulative glaciological mass balance on csg was also in good agreement with the regional a 2 n 2 e cell centred around the csg icesat derived cumulative mass balance wastage over 2003 2008 41 recently a regional study covering the whole high mountain asia estimated the geodetic mass balances for the lahaul spiti region as 0 49 0 22 m w e a 1 and 0 11 0 19 m w e a 1 over 2000 2008 and 2009 2016 respectively 7 the reduced wastage after 2008 over the whole lahaul spiti region is in good agreement with the observed in situ mass wastage on csg 19 where the glaciological mass balance was much less negative with a value of 0 17 0 40 m w e a 1 over 2009 2019 compared to 0 99 0 40 m w e a 1 over 2002 2008 fig 3a therefore it can be concluded that the representativeness of csg for the whole lahaul spiti region as previously suggested over 1999 2011 17 is also continuing after 2011 5 2 importance of integrated monitoring on csg in order to highlight the importance of integrated monitoring on a reference glacier catchment a thorough compilation of all the available studies developed on csg was done a total of 63 studies including grey literature as well as non peer reviewed papers were found on google search a four level screening was then applied in order to select the most important studies in the field of glacio hydrology fig 5 a and finally 14 studies were selected to showcase the importance of integrated monitoring on csg catchment for the glacio hydrology of the himalaya fig 5b table 2 these screened studies were categorized in three categories based on their main focuses i e in situ remote sensing and modelling studies about hydrochemistry isotopes sediments geo morphology and reviews were intentionally excluded because the present review focuses mainly on glacio hydrology dobhal et al 1995 20 is the oldest study while azam et al 2019 15 is the latest study among them out of 14 studies in situ remote sensing modelling studies are 5 3 and 6 respectively all together these studies have a total 972 citations equivalent to 11 citation per paper per year on google scholar on 25 november 2020 this high annual citation value clearly indicates the crucial importance of integrated monitoring developed on csg for the himalayan glacio hydrology some of the important uses of the developed studies on csg catchment for other regional scale studies are being highlighted hereafter in situ glacier wide mass balances have been used to validate several satellite estimates 17 23 as well as to calibrate validate several modelling studies 25 26 30 kumar et al 33 modelled the mass balance of all the himalayan glaciers and validated their results using in situ mass balances on chhota shigri and mera glaciers 41 geodetic mass balances from vincent et al 17 together with in situ mass balances 24 were used to calibrate a glacio hydrological model that estimated the mass balances and runoffs from csg catchment over 1969 2016 15 further several studies 17 23 34 35 compared the in situ and geodetic mass balances on csg with the regional mass balance of the whole lahaul spiti region and educed the regional representativeness of csg for the whole lahaul spiti region 2100 km2 glacierized area section 5 1 ice thickness data from gpr measurements on csg 24 has been extensively used to calibrate the ice thickness and volume models at glacier scale 31 43 covering the whole himalaya 44 as well as in some global studies 45 recently ice thickness models intercomparison experiment phase 2 also used ice thickness and velocity data from csg 46 47 moreover ice thickness data was also used to calibrate the glabtop2 glacier bed topography model version 2 model developed to investigate the glacier bed overdeepenings for 28 000 glaciers in the whole himalaya 44 most of the glacio hydrological modelling studies in the himalaya have been developed applying the temperature index approach 11 15 37 in which melting is generated as a function of positive air temperature using the melt factors 48 melt factors for snow ice and debris covered ice developed using the field data on csg 26 have also been used in several modelling studies shea et al 37 modelled the glacier changes in the everest region nepal between 1961 and 2007 through starting their model calibration with the melt factors obtained on csg 26 recently another study modelled the mass balances of siachen glacier largest glacier in india over 1986 2018 exploiting the melt factors information on csg 49 stream discharge data was also used for calibration of glacio hydrological models developed for csg 15 30 5 3 proposed research strategy wgms suggested a multilevel glacier monitoring strategy global hierarchical observing strategy including tiers 1 5 22 these are quickly briefed here tier 1 development of integrated experimental sites with a focus on process based understanding of interactions feedbacks between different variables snow glaciers permafrost hydrology soils green cover etc tier 2 long term process based annual seasonal mass balance monitoring within major climatic zones for calibration validation of numerical models tier 3 glacier mass balance estimation in major mountain systems using reduced number of stakes tier 4 long term length change measurements and tier 5 upgradation of glacier inventories at 5 10 years of time step for comparative studies integrated monitoring on csg has been developed following tier 2 guidelines section 3 the crucial importance of csg catchment monitoring for the himalayan glacio hydrology is clearly evident through high citations of the screened studies section 5 2 here these screened studies are further investigated and their citations are categorized in i field based ii remote sensing iii modelling and iv other studies other category includes all studies having focus other than glacio hydrology the distribution of citations for each study is displayed through a chord diagram fig 6 a in general each screened study whether field based remote sensing or model based on csg received citations by field based remote sensing or modelling studies fig 6a that shows how different approaches are interconnected further field based studies on csg have been extensively used in remote sensing and modelling studies fig 6a that shows the general scarcity of in situ data in the himalaya while highlighting the importance of field based studies for regional remote sensing and modelling studies as discussed in section 5 2 in order to understand the impact of climate change on glaciers and thus on melt dependent river hydrology long term monitoring of glacier catchments is required which is scarce for the himalaya 2 3 geodetic mass estimates partially fill this gap for glaciers as they can provide long term mean mass balance estimates in past but a clear picture of climate glacier runoff linkages 2 3 glacio hydrological modelling can also bridge the gap however models need to be carefully calibrated using plenty of in situ and remote sensing data to provide reliable results 13 15 37 considering these points and interconnectivity of different studies fig 6a as well as discussed importance of integrated monitoring on csg catchment section 5 2 it is hereby proposed to develop catchment scale integrated monitoring of glaciers combining and exploiting together the in situ remote sensing and modelling approaches as shown in the himalayan cryosphere triangle hct fig 6b indeed monitoring is not possible for much of the glacier catchments however similar to csg catchment some more reference glacier catchments should be carefully selected from different climatic regimes along the himalayan range for long term glacier mass balance energy balance dynamic and hydrological studies following the wgms tier 2 guidelines as well as proposed integrated monitoring under hct research strategy 6 conclusion all the studies including in situ geodetic and modelling suggest a long term mean mass wastage on csg the mean mass wastage using all available studies was calculated as 0 25 0 35 m w e a 1 over 1955 2019 period showing a moderate mass loss csg showed a near steady state over 1990 s before entering to a higher mass wastage during first decade of the 21st century and then again slightly less mass wastage after 2010 the in situ geodetic and modelled mass balances on csg were found to be similar to mean mass balances of all glaciers in the whole lahaul spiti 2100 km2 region confirming its regional representativeness as a response to near steady state mass balance over 1990s and subsequent post 2000 mass wastage on csg the surface velocities were also in balance over 1990s and have been reducing since 2000 csg catchment hydrology is dominated by the snow melt 63 followed by almost equal contributions from ice melt and rainfall runoff the mass balance and catchment hydrology of csg are mainly controlled by summer monsoon snowfalls air temperature while deciding the precipitation phase also plays an indirect yet important role for the functioning of csg catchment in order to understand the importance of integrated monitoring on csg catchment for the glacio hydrology of the himalaya all the studies available on csg were compiled and 14 studies were shortlisted applying a four level screening these studies in situ remote sensing or model received high citations 11 per year per paper at google scholar generally screened studies received citations by field based remote sensing as well as modelling studies indicating the interconnectivity of different approaches further they have been extensively used to validate the remote sensing products as well as to calibrate validate the glacio hydrological models presently such monitoring networks are extremely limited in the himalaya therefore the calibration of large scale glacio hydrological models covering the entire himalaya has often been done using the limited in situ glaciological data or observed river discharge data far below from glaciers considering the importance of integrated monitoring on csg catchment it is proposed to select more reference glacier catchments from different climatic regimes in the himalaya for long term glaciological studies following the wgms tier 2 guidelines and applying the in situ remote sensing and model approaches following hct research strategy fortunately similar to csg a few studies are growing on mera khumbu nepal yala langtang nepal and chorabari garhwal india glaciers 2 3 42 49 but several regions such as karakoram zanskar sikkim himalaya bhutan are yet unexplored 2 therefore selection of more reference glacier catchments is highly recommended to develop a coherent picture of the climate glacier river runoff relationship in the himalayan region as a timely step to ensure water security in future an improved understanding of the himalayan cryosphere is also necessary to understand the increased frequency and magnitude of mountain disasters their mitigation and policy developments for the sustainable progress of the himalayan water resources 50 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

20114,security for water and other resources in india is likely to come under stress with rising demands and growing water scarcity in india more than 75 of the annual flows occur in rivers during four monsoon months and this is also the period when flooding takes place the major causes of water insecurity in india are a highly skewed water availability variability and increasing demands b poor water quality and issues arising due to these c weak water governance and d emerging challenges due to climate and land use cover changes this paper focuses on the first cause of floods i have argued here that flood flows should be viewed and harvested as a resource to be conserved and utilized to overcome water shortages rather than to be passed to oceans as quickly as possible conservation and diversion of flood flows can help in overcoming water shortages variability and disaster management both infrastructure and governance will have to be expanded to achieve this objective to that end the paper presents suggestions to conserve divert and utilize flood flows keywords water security india conservation flood flows long distance water transfer flood plains utfi rbf 1 introduction india has monsoonic climate more than 75 of the annual flows occur during 4 months from june to september some of this flow is used to irrigate crop lands fill reservoirs tanks and ponds generate electricity and so on but a considerable part of flood waters just flows down the rivers cause damages by the force of swift flows and inundation and finally joins oceans it is argued sometimes that india has large water potential compared to the demands and should not face much problem if the resources are carefully managed evidently the estimates of demand and availability of water appear to be somewhat comfortable for the nation as a whole but if we ignore the demand and availability for the north eastern part and western ghats regions which have huge water availability accompanied by small demands and noting that only small quantity of water can be transferred from these places to the other parts of the country due to logistics and environmental concerns the relative magnitudes of water availability and demands become unfavourable the complexity of the problem further rises noting the fact that after the wet season flows in many rivers is inadequate to meet even the drinking water needs of the nearby population in fact many small rivers stop flowing for a few months in the dry season jain 9 has discussed various dimensions of water security highlighting the relation between water security and sustainable growth an oecd 14 report noted investment in water security helps to drive sustainable growth before discussing more on ways to provide water security we discuss here the major threats to water security in india 1 1 threats to water security in india india has large spatial and temporal variability in water availability that lead to various problems including floods and droughts india also faces large regional mismatch between water availability and demands at many places demands for various uses have already exceeded the sustainable supplies to meet the increasing demands withdrawal of water from surface and subsurface sources are rising and such withdrawals have already become unsustainable in many regions for example in parts of punjab studies also show that in the recent times many places are receiving more intense rainfalls e g 8 19 23 which are leading to more intense flash floods frequent flooding and droughts in various parts of the country show that existing infrastructure and governance are unable to satisfactorily resolve the problem to manage increasing variabilities existing infrastructure is to be upgraded or new infrastructure should be created small water bodies are quite helpful in water conservation at local scales but these are also frequently being encroached upon or filled up with the above background it is felt that one of the best strategies for india to ensure water security for its people is to conserve flood flows by using all possible means this water can be used to recharge aquifers or it can be diverted to the regions facing water shortage while suggesting this we recognize the importance of environmental flows in the rivers and that sufficient water should flow down to the oceans for healthy marine delta ecosystems the first step in conservation of flood flows would be an assessment of available water in indian rivers 2 water potential of indian rivers table 1 shows the average annual water potential in the major rivers and groups in india and estimated utilizable flow excluding ground water from two sources there is a minor difference in the two estimates it is noted that most of the water potential is present in the river basins of indus ganga brahmaputra godavari krishna cauvery mahanadi brahmani baitarani narmada and tapi river groups such as the east flowing and west flowing rivers of the peninsula contain large potential due to high rainfall but this is of limited use since this potential arises from numerous rivers of short length and their basins don t have much water demand cultivable area can be taken up as a proxy for water demand and on this basis river basins with high agricultural water demand are indus ganga brahmaputra godavari krishna cauvery mahanadi narmada and tapi flow duration curves for a few rivers were plotted by using the monthly data and the flows during the monsoon season were examined to identify the duration and volume of high flows fig 1 shows two such curves looking at the shape of the fdcs high flows were identified as the flows that are present in the river about 18 of the time or less because beyond this percentage the slope of fdcs changes significantly another way could be to consider the flows in the month of highest discharge as the flood flows on average for these basins the flow in the month of highest flow is about 30 of the total flows it is however acknowledged that some subjectivity is involved here since there is no clear definition of flood flows different persons will place the threshold differently and arrive at somewhat different values for flood flows but this being a policy related article the presented estimates should suffice applying this approximate number uniformly for all the basins the flood flows were computed as shown in the last column in table 1 based on these computations gross floods flows in all river basins are estimated at 180 billion cubic meter bcm many storage projects have been constructed in some river basins such as the krishna narmada mahanadi cauvery and godawari where substantial water is conserved nevertheless there is scope to further conserve much more flow further for the brahmaputra basin the utilizable flows are estimated at 25 bcm but more water can be conserved utilized in this basin by following the policy of store and divert it is seen from table 1 that significant quantities of flood flows are present in about eleven river basins note that even though a large river basin may be water surplus on gross level there may be local water deficits for example ganga river basin has high flood flows but many sub basins face water scarcity in the dry season some basins such as krishna cauvery and narmada already have good storage capacity and the possibility of water conservation through new large storage s is limited in view of unfavourable opinion about large dams in india it is assumed that the existing reservoirs are already conserving about 30 of the flood flows and to account for this net flood flows have been reduced by 0 3 storage capacity created in a particular basin thus the net flood flows turn out to be 122 bcm it is assumed that rivers in arid regions such as sabarmati mahi and pennar do not have appreciable flood flows and length of east west flowing rivers in plain areas is quite small as expected some basins notably ganga brahmaputra godavari and mahanadi have substantial flood flows some of this water can be conserved within the basin and some part can be diverted to areas facing water shortages thereby simultaneously addressing the problems due to excess and deficit of water diversion of water is discussed in more details in a later section these actions can help saving using about 122 bcm of water which can be very beneficial since currently gross water demands in india are about 700 bcm note that the estimates mentioned here are ballpark numbers that need to be firmed up by detailed surveys investigations and impact assessment 2 1 impact of climate change and human interventions on flood flows most indian river basins are highly vulnerable to climate change climate change will impact these basins through changes in rainfall pattern and intensities temperature rise would impact snow fall and snow glacier melt demands for water and rise of sea water level will impact submarine groundwater discharge and intrusion of salinity in coastal aquifers temperature projections for india are in line with the global trends and in general increased warming is expected across all the rcp scenarios projections of precipitation for the indian region given by ipcc 6 show that with increasing concentration of greenhouse gases and moving forward in time magnitude and variability of precipitation will increase for india this will lead to more instances of floods and droughts many researchers have tried to understand the impacts on individual or group of river basins by using climatic and hydrologic models the ganga brahmaputra basin is a highly vulnerable zone due to climate change impact since it receives much snow and melt of snow and glaciers is impacted by warming gain et al 5 investigated the impact of climate change on flows of the lower brahmaputra region they created a weighted ensemble of transient stream flow by using the outputs from multiple models for 1961 2100 based on this data and long term observed flow data at bahadurabad station in bangladesh it was found that in future extreme low flows are expected to become less frequent but peak flows are likely to increase significantly shah and mishra 21 studied changes in hydroclimatic variables in 18 indian river basins by analysing long term 1901 2012 data it was reported that in the period 1948 2012 precipitation in the monsoon season decreased in 11 basins out of 18 trends were with statistically significant in one basin surface water availability and et declined in eight basins among these the decline was significant in four basins nepal 11 assessed the historic and projected trends in climate for the koshi river basin by statistical analysis he used data for the period 1995 to 2096 from the regional climate model known as providing regional climates for impacts studies precis and the a1b climate scenario to project the impacts of climate change for two temporal windows mid century 2040 2050 and late century 2086 2096 it was reported that snowfall and snow storage is likely to fall due to rising temperature and snowmelt runoff from non glaciated areas will fall further the annual discharge will increase by 13 by the mid century and will subsequently fall slightly evapotranspiration is expected to rise by 16 by the end of the century a study of upper narmada basin by use of the global water availability assessment gwava model 17 found that the hydrological regime in the basin is likely to intensify over the next 50 years due to climate change which will lead to long term increases in river flows in the monsoon season it is expected that climate change will have little impact on dry season flows thus broadly due to climate change the flows of indian rivers and their variabilities will increase in future in addition to climate change two other distinct human interventions will impact flood flows land use land cover changes lulc and storages diversion withdrawals in case of lulc the dominant change will be conversion of forest and agriculture lands to urban areas these changes will cause reduction in infiltration more surface runoff and sharper and higher hydrograph peaks upstream storages diversion and withdrawals will reduce the volume of flood flows at a downstream location of course the extent of changes will depend on the size of interventions and the way these are managed in many indian river basins groundwater levels have fallen substantially due to large withdrawals for irrigation and this has begun to impact river flows in my opinion depletion of groundwater levels would not have large impact on flood flows 3 ways to conserve flood flows a number of means can be adopted to conserve flood flows ranging from large storages to small ponds water transfer and aquifer storages each of these means is discussed here in details 3 1 conserving water by large and medium storages large and medium size storage projects have the potential to significantly control flooding in the downstream area by conserving large quantity of damage causing water besides flood control the conserved water is also used to meet some other demands use of storages to even out the fluctuations in river flows due to monsoonic climate is an attractive option in india keeping in view the availability of water good sites perception about large projects and environmental concerns construction of major projects with storages of more than a few billion cubic meters is becoming progressively tedious in india of course the possibility of constructing projects of medium and smaller sizes is high and should be pursued put together a number of such projects in different basins may help conserving substantial volumes of flood waters regulation policies for all the projects in a river basin should be developed by treating them as a single system for realizing the best possible gains as far as reservoirs are concerned major states of india such as maharashtra karnataka madhya pradesh orissa telangana andhra pradesh and gujarat account for major share of reservoir capacity in india these reservoirs tap the waters of major rivers namely krishna godavari mahanadi narmada and cauvery there is a possibility of harnessing significant quantity of flood waters in ganga brahmaputra godavari and mahanadi river basins storages could be constructed on those tributaries of these rivers that carry large flows most suitable sites storage for storage development are in mountains where land submergence for the given volume of storage is less compared to the plain areas it is noted that storages will be an essential component of a proposal to transfer large quantities of water however construction of storages on the northern tributaries of ganga river that come from nepal and carry large quantities of flows will require that the transboundary issues are settled based on the performance appraisal of 383 flood control reservoirs and 8500 mile of levees in the usa comiskey 3 found that these structures have prevented about 710 billion in flood damages estimates adjusted for inflation from 1928 to 2000 he concluded that for every dollar spent on the construction of flood reduction projects about 6 in potential damages from flooding has been averted during the past six decades up to year 2000 i could not locate a similar study on the performance of indian reservoirs more discussion on this topic and use of this water is given in a later section 3 2 water conservation by ponds and wetlands in india tanks and ponds are traditional sources of conserving water to meet daily needs for drinking sanitation irrigation etc in fact most villages or neighbourhoods would have a tank for providing water for these purposes ponds and wetlands also aid in ground water recharge and promote bio diversity over the time due to population pressure and neglect many ponds were filled up fully or partially for example as per wikipedia the area of water bodies of the bangalore city has reduced from 2324 ha in 1973 to just about 1005 ha in 2005 in most places the reduction in water area has been due to encroachment or change in land use table 2 gives the numbers and areas of small medium and large reservoirs in various states of india further detailing of small reservoirs and irrigation tanks in given in table 3 the total area of small inland water bodies is unevenly distributed over india five states orissa andhra pradesh gujarat karnataka and west bengal have more than 50 of india s inland water bodies according to the national wetland inventory and assessment report 15 inland natural wetlands accounted for about 43 cent of the total wetland area the number of tanks in india was estimated at about 1 22 lakh about 5 56 lakh small wetlands including village ponds area 2 25 ha were identified 15 about 65 of total area under tanks and ponds in india lies in andhra pradesh karnataka tamil nadu and uttar pradesh assuming an average depth of 1 5 m the small reservoirs would be conserving about 8 3 bcm of water if an effort is made to expand and deepen these bodies dig some more and considering recharge during rainy months around 15 bcm of water can be conserved by small reservoirs table 3 shows that irrigation tanks are mostly found in five states tamil nadu karnataka andhra pradesh gujarat and up assuming average depth of water as 2 0 m such tanks would be conserving about 18 7 bcm of water since irrigation tanks have proven to be useful in these states it would be helpful for water security if the tank culture is developed in other water stressed states also particularly in maharashtra orissa rajasthan punjab and haryana hence with persistent efforts to expand the existing tanks and construct new tanks around 15 bcm of additional water can be conserved by irrigation tanks there have been many success stories of pond and lake rejuvenation in various parts of the country these isolated efforts need to be scaled up significantly rejuvenation of small water bodies can immensely help in achieving water security and resilience to mitigate climate change to that end several steps need to be taken it is high time that a database of ponds wetlands with coordinates water spread area storage capacity and other pertinent variables is prepared so that their full potential is exploited in a systematic and planned manner numerous ponds across the country have been encroached upon based on old records and field visits such ponds need to identified and salvaged however salvaging encroached ponds involves law and order problems as the squatters seldom move away easily field visits will also help in identifying the locations where new ponds tanks can be developed and then take up such works under various schemes of the government gis database with layers of dem data soil data layer rainfall data layer and geologic maps would be of immense value in this effort 3 3 use of flood plains many rivers and their tributaries originating in mountains have vast flood plains when the river is about to end its mountain run or after it emerges from the mountain reaches and enters in plain areas for instance rivers such as ganga and its tributaries have wide flood plains at various places along their channels the width of these plains varies from a few hundreds of meters to about a kilometre or even more at a few places a variety of land uses are seen in these flood plains in many places these are just barren stretches of land in some cases these lands are put under cultivation after the flood season by using the residual soil moisture when the river passes through near a city the flood plains are usually occupied by built infrastructure such as houses offices and commercial areas with small interventions many of these flood plains can be used to temporarily hold flood waters as the discharge in the river increases a part of the flow can be diverted towards the flood plains and stored as an example an area of 500 m width 50 km length and with 2 m depth of water can hold 50 mcm of water since soils in these plains typically have high hydraulic conductivity much of this water will rapidly infiltrate in the ground thus the flood plains can effectively conserve water equivalent to several times their storage capacity on a national scale the volume of water conserved would be substantial fig 2 shows flood plains of ganga river near balawali near haridwar uttar pradesh which are suitable locations for conserving flood waters similarly flood plains of tributaries in the hilly reaches can also be used for this purpose fig 2 also shows wide valley of henval a tributary of ganga in uttarakhand where the valley floors can be utilized for conserving flood flows a project called room for the river with the aim of flood damage control was implemented in the netherlands fig 3 the basic premise of the room for the river project is to give more space to the river to flow so that high water levels during floods are confined to the extended flood plains the project implemented at over 30 locations across the netherlands costed 2 3 billion euros tailor made solutions were designed for each river key features of this project were lowering the flood plain deepening the summer bed relocation and strengthening of dykes removing obstacles reducing the height of the groynes and increasing the depth of the side channels another feature of the project was to improve the areas nearby the river banks by constructing fountains and panoramic decks the landscapes are changed and turned into natural sponges so as to absorb excess water during floods 3 4 riverbank filtration rbf riverbank filtration rbf is a technique in which wells are drilled along a river some distance away from the channel and water is pumped out as the river water infiltrates and moves through the soils matrix towards the rbf wells significant parts of dissolved and suspended contaminants are removed from water by the bed sediments in rbf a combination of chemical physical and biological processes work to treat the raw water rbf wells should be placed sufficiently far from the rivers so that the water pumped out has passed for enough distance through the sediments as the rbf wells pump out water a gradient is created towards the well that induces the river water to flow towards the wells studies report very high efficiencies in removing bacteria and heavy metals such as chromium cadmium zinc and lead of course depending upon the properties of the soil aquifer material rbf has been in use in usa and europe for quite some time to supply drinking water sandhu et al 20 examined a number of operational rbf in india and critically evaluated suitability of many potential sites based on hydrogeology and land use they noted that india has large potential to employ rbf technology to supply drinking water to cities located on the banks or rivers and big lakes of course the technology is simple well tested and scalable 3 5 long distance water transfer from the point of view of water and food security water transfer from the surplus to deficit basins areas is an intuitive and attractive option in the long run water transfer would be necessary to achieve sustainable water security to that end a national perspective plan for long distance water transfer called inter linking of rivers ilr was prepared by the national water development agency nwda www nwda gov in this grand scheme consisted of two components himalayan component having 14 links and peninsular component having 16 links a link called mahanadi godavari link was envisaged to transfer surplus water from the brahmaputra ganga and mahanadi basins to southern india to largely eliminate the deficits in krishna pennar cauvery and vaigai basins although the ilr is an attractive and rational scheme it has faced opposition from various groups and individuals on account of political environmental and financial reasons many state governments are not enthusiastic about transfer of water from their territory to other states the cost of the entire scheme is estimated as rs 8440 billion 7 this is a ballpark estimate the actual cost of all the projects may be substantially different than these numbers of course the possibility of implementation of the entire scheme in foreseeable future is quite remote when the ilr schemes were conceptualized ground water availability was not directly taken into consideration over the time the use of ground water for irrigation has increased considerably it is necessary and scientifically correct to consider ground water use to determine the net shortfall of water in a region or river basin also it is high time that the concept of water productivity is introduced in planning accordingly crop water demands should be computed corresponding to the best values of water productivity in the region these two considerations will reduce the required volume of diversions size of storages and link canals thereby reducing the cost of projects further if lesser water is diverted the impacts as well as the opposition to the projects will also be lesser there are many reasons behind slow progress in the construction of ilr projects currently widespread support for the scheme is missing many people consider that ilr will largely overcome many problems due to spatial mismatch between water availability and demands and significantly contribute to water security but many others hold opposite views also in india any water project involving more than one state would require strong support from the central and all state governments and gathering this support will be an uphill task there are also concerns from social and environmental view perhaps the entire scheme is too gigantic see fig 4 many attempts have been made in the past to come up with alternatives but these were not found to be technically or financially feasible the following analysis has been carried out to devise a scheme to overcome large water needs of deficit regions on a sustainable basis without resorting to stopgap arrangements beginning with the basic objective of long distance water transfer the analysis should begin with identification of major regions of water surplus as well as deficits on a national scale based on the examination of the ilr plan of nwda and water availability data in different river basins the places where we have surplus water are manas sankoch sub basins in brahmaputra basin sarda and ghaghra sub basins ganga basin south ganga basin in west bengal jharkhand mahanadi river and godavari river the regions with critical water shortage are south punjab rajasthan and parts of gujarat parts of krishna basin cauvery basin and palar basin in addition many small regions scattered over the country are facing water deficits if the noted regions of water surplus and deficits are connected by efficient water transfer links the demands in the zones of deficits water can be met on a sustainable basis by using the water which is likely to cause flood damages fig 5 shows four such main links 1 sarda to rajasthan north gujarat 2 manas sankosh tributaries of brahmaputra to mahanadi via ganga 3 mahanadi to godavari and krishna and 4 krishna to cauvery and pennar water transfer can be accomplished by open canals pipelines or a combination branch links emerging from the main links or grand canals may supply water to the enroute areas or to nearby deficit zones in terms of the volume of water to be transferred nwda has planned to transfer about 18 bcm of water from sarda to rajasthan gujarat the manas sankosh teesta ganga link will be a massive canal involving diversion of about 40 bcm of water from manas and sankosh rivers in the brahmaputra basin to ganga upstream of farakka this water will augment flows of ganga and some of it will be transferred all the way to south india through mahanadi and godavari rivers the other major proposed routes of diversion are the mahanadi godavari link about 11 bcm of diversion and about 20 bcm of water from godavari river to krishna and down south through a number of links it is seen that the sarda to rajasthan north gujarat main link number 1 broad filled arrow is independent of the other main links for the remaining three volume of transfer by main links 3 broad unfilled dotted arrow and 4 broad unfilled dash dot arrow could be more if main link 2 broad unfilled dashed arrow also becomes operational simultaneously to rationalize the volume of water transfer it would be helpful to adopt the best crop water management practices that will help save the water further right cropping pattern based on soils and climate should be developed in the areas receiving water use of ground water in agriculture needs to be explicitly considered and wherever feasible water should be recycled and reused water supplied should be charged such that the users have an incentive to avoid wastage and the scheme becomes financially viable some type of financial incentive to the donors to be supported by the users can also be thought also on the pattern of power trading there could also be water trading to promote efficient use of water and transparency 3 6 agricultural water management in india about 90 of the water demand comes from the agricultural sector studies have shown that there is huge variation in water productivity among different states and river basins for example fig 6 shows water and land productivity of rice across the indian states this figure shows high variation in the productivity across various indian states water productivity is about 0 7 kg m3 in jharkhand and chattisgarh whereas it is about 0 2 kg m3 in haryana punjab and maharashtra this implies that if the water productivity can be increased in the states where these are low right now about 1 3rd units of water will be required to obtain nearly the same output a range of benefits are possible by enhancing water productivity in the places where water deficits are marginal it may become possible to meet the demands by using the available resources the interlinking proposals were drawn long ago and the requirements to transfer water were computed by using normal water productivity values which were typically low in those times ilr projects are expensive and their cost depends upon the size of various components such as dams and canals the ilr projects should promote and support the best use of each drop of water and to that end the water demands in the receiving areas should be computed by using the best value of water productivity this approach will reduce the amount of water to be transferred thereby reducing the size of various components such as reservoir canals and regulating structure with these changes hopefully the projects will face less resistance such a scenario will be beneficial for water and food security 3 7 underground taming transfer of floods utfi large falls in water tables in many aquifer systems has created vacant space that can hold flood waters underground taming transfer of floods for irrigation utfi is a new approach for mitigating flood impacts that involves diversion of flood waters into storages in depleted aquifers water thus stored in aquifers can be later used primarily to irrigate crops it can also be utilized for other purposes utfi helps in conjunctive management of dams and aquifers it is also beneficial to environment for substantial outcomes and benefits it is best to plan utfi over a larger area and involve local communities in its implementation to assess the suitability of utfi on a global scale international water management institute iwmi has carried out a global scale spatial analysis to identify areas that are highly suitable for implementing utfi 16 1 three sites were studied ramganga in india awash in ethiopia and chao phraya in thailand authors mentioned that the results from their study will help identify the broad areas for more detailed studies to ascertain with higher confidence the technical and economic feasibility of utfi reddy et al 18 reviewed the existing institutional approaches concerning management of utfi in south asia they propose a new institutional framework for mainstreaming management of utfi for this region managed aquifer recharge should be integrated with long distance water transfer plans since the link canals will pass through some of the places that have seen dramatic fall in water tables in recent times such a convergence of schemes will help increase benefits and solve multiple problems natural depressions can be identified from dem and used to recharge aquifers for a natural recharge pond which dries periodically and the bottom is cleaned the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the soil governs recharge typical conductivity values are about 0 3 m day for sandy loams 1 m day for loamy sands 5 m day for fine sands and 10 m day for coarser sands recharge rates of course depend on many factors such as the water depth in pond ground water level gradient pond bottom clogging etc evaporation rates from such bodies vary from 0 3 m year or less in cold humid climates to about 2 5 m year in warm dry places thus evaporation losses are quite small compared to infiltration and during warm periods when evaporation rates are very high such ponds may be dry just to understand approximate values in real life christy and lakshmanan 2 reported that a pond of size 8 m 8 m 1 75 m in a saline aquifer north of chennai recharged about 98 m3 of water from september 2012 to may 2013 the region had quaternary formation it consisted of clay silt sand and gravel and their admixtures the top of the sequence consists of sandstone of about 45 60 m thickness these are underlined by carbonaceous shales of upper gondwana the price of water recharged from this pond worked out to about rs 0 225 per litre clearly better returns will be possible from larger systems 3 8 comparative study of water conservation measures a range of approaches have been proposed in this paper for flood control and conservation of flood water the options suggested vary in size from large storage to farm ponds the impacts will vary from local scale to a large region funds requirement will vary from a small amount to billions of rupees further the impacts on the environment and society risks skills required to construct and operate and the actors associated with the project will vary over a huge range table 4 contains a brief appraisal of various options based on these parameters it is clear that each option has some advantages limitations concerns and requirements the suitability or otherwise of an option in a particular place will depend on the extent and magnitude of the problem feasibility hydrological engineering environmental financial and political and the preferences of the society it will not be wise to out rightly reject any option in most situations a bouquet of options is likely to be the best solution among all the options to conserve flood water and improve water security for the nation long distance water transfer if properly implemented and managed can provide the largest contribution to water security at the national scale china has implemented the south to north water transfer project which is transferring large quantities of water from water surplus south to water deficit north and enhancing water security in india a big hurdle to any national level project will be lack of consensus among the key players and requisite finances here it is comparatively easier to build intra state water transfer projects which can enhance water and food security but for a small region only grey and sadoff 24 examined water security achieved by various countries the paths they adopted and the price they paid based on hydrological typologies they classified the countries in three groups those that have harnessed hydrology countries hampered by hydrology and countries that are hostage to hydrology india falls somewhere in the middle group and would require large investment in institutions and infrastructure to achieve water security for its citizens vorosmarty et al 25 presented a comprehensive analysis of approaches to meet water security threats by blending natural and engineering solutions they demonstrated that future global water security can be achieved by following policies that support blended green gray approaches and a strategic commitment to preserve natural capital is necessary in absence of these the costs of hydrological infrastructure and services is likely to rise significantly this paper has also suggested a blend of green and engineering measures for achieving water security for india 4 final remarks and conclusions techniques for flood management can be broadly classified in two groups structural and non structural flood risk can be expressed as 1 risk hazard vulnerability structural methods such as reservoirs and embankments try to manage the hazard part of the risk and non structural such as flood forecasting flood plain zoning the vulnerability part of course there is some overlap also in the risk reduced by both methods both methods have their advantages and limitations but the structural methods while managing flood risk can also conserve the resource water and this is a very welcome feature of these techniques jain and singh 10 provide a detailed discussion on this topic this paper suggests that flood flows should be seen as a resource in india that need to be conserved for subsequent utilization and contribute to water security such an action and change in approach to manage floods will go a long way in providing water security to the nation in this paper structural or supply side measures for flood risk reduction and helping with water security have been examined i have tried to estimate the volume of flood flows in major indian rivers and have suggested some ways by which the flood flows can be conserved and converted into a useful resource some new techniques such as utfi and rbf have the potential to help in sustainable water resources management besides yielding environmental and social benefits conserved flood flows can also be used to recharge depleted aquifers thereby contributing to sustainabile use of ground water and increased baseflows in rivers some techniques presented here can be implemented by involving public to help with employment livelihood concerns resources from the ongoing programs such as mnrega can also be utilized for the related works a comparative assessment showing the merits demerits impacts and concerns for the various options to conserve water and control floods have been presented in terms of size scale of impacts and other factors the suggested options have a huge range to provide water security to a big country a wide range of options covering supply as well as demand side management need to be examined a careful combination of different measures would go a long way in providing sustainable water security to the people of india declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments the author would like to thank the indian institute of technology roorkee for making available the requisite facilities while working on this paper he would also like to thank the reviewers and the section editor for insightful comments that helped in improving the paper 
20114,security for water and other resources in india is likely to come under stress with rising demands and growing water scarcity in india more than 75 of the annual flows occur in rivers during four monsoon months and this is also the period when flooding takes place the major causes of water insecurity in india are a highly skewed water availability variability and increasing demands b poor water quality and issues arising due to these c weak water governance and d emerging challenges due to climate and land use cover changes this paper focuses on the first cause of floods i have argued here that flood flows should be viewed and harvested as a resource to be conserved and utilized to overcome water shortages rather than to be passed to oceans as quickly as possible conservation and diversion of flood flows can help in overcoming water shortages variability and disaster management both infrastructure and governance will have to be expanded to achieve this objective to that end the paper presents suggestions to conserve divert and utilize flood flows keywords water security india conservation flood flows long distance water transfer flood plains utfi rbf 1 introduction india has monsoonic climate more than 75 of the annual flows occur during 4 months from june to september some of this flow is used to irrigate crop lands fill reservoirs tanks and ponds generate electricity and so on but a considerable part of flood waters just flows down the rivers cause damages by the force of swift flows and inundation and finally joins oceans it is argued sometimes that india has large water potential compared to the demands and should not face much problem if the resources are carefully managed evidently the estimates of demand and availability of water appear to be somewhat comfortable for the nation as a whole but if we ignore the demand and availability for the north eastern part and western ghats regions which have huge water availability accompanied by small demands and noting that only small quantity of water can be transferred from these places to the other parts of the country due to logistics and environmental concerns the relative magnitudes of water availability and demands become unfavourable the complexity of the problem further rises noting the fact that after the wet season flows in many rivers is inadequate to meet even the drinking water needs of the nearby population in fact many small rivers stop flowing for a few months in the dry season jain 9 has discussed various dimensions of water security highlighting the relation between water security and sustainable growth an oecd 14 report noted investment in water security helps to drive sustainable growth before discussing more on ways to provide water security we discuss here the major threats to water security in india 1 1 threats to water security in india india has large spatial and temporal variability in water availability that lead to various problems including floods and droughts india also faces large regional mismatch between water availability and demands at many places demands for various uses have already exceeded the sustainable supplies to meet the increasing demands withdrawal of water from surface and subsurface sources are rising and such withdrawals have already become unsustainable in many regions for example in parts of punjab studies also show that in the recent times many places are receiving more intense rainfalls e g 8 19 23 which are leading to more intense flash floods frequent flooding and droughts in various parts of the country show that existing infrastructure and governance are unable to satisfactorily resolve the problem to manage increasing variabilities existing infrastructure is to be upgraded or new infrastructure should be created small water bodies are quite helpful in water conservation at local scales but these are also frequently being encroached upon or filled up with the above background it is felt that one of the best strategies for india to ensure water security for its people is to conserve flood flows by using all possible means this water can be used to recharge aquifers or it can be diverted to the regions facing water shortage while suggesting this we recognize the importance of environmental flows in the rivers and that sufficient water should flow down to the oceans for healthy marine delta ecosystems the first step in conservation of flood flows would be an assessment of available water in indian rivers 2 water potential of indian rivers table 1 shows the average annual water potential in the major rivers and groups in india and estimated utilizable flow excluding ground water from two sources there is a minor difference in the two estimates it is noted that most of the water potential is present in the river basins of indus ganga brahmaputra godavari krishna cauvery mahanadi brahmani baitarani narmada and tapi river groups such as the east flowing and west flowing rivers of the peninsula contain large potential due to high rainfall but this is of limited use since this potential arises from numerous rivers of short length and their basins don t have much water demand cultivable area can be taken up as a proxy for water demand and on this basis river basins with high agricultural water demand are indus ganga brahmaputra godavari krishna cauvery mahanadi narmada and tapi flow duration curves for a few rivers were plotted by using the monthly data and the flows during the monsoon season were examined to identify the duration and volume of high flows fig 1 shows two such curves looking at the shape of the fdcs high flows were identified as the flows that are present in the river about 18 of the time or less because beyond this percentage the slope of fdcs changes significantly another way could be to consider the flows in the month of highest discharge as the flood flows on average for these basins the flow in the month of highest flow is about 30 of the total flows it is however acknowledged that some subjectivity is involved here since there is no clear definition of flood flows different persons will place the threshold differently and arrive at somewhat different values for flood flows but this being a policy related article the presented estimates should suffice applying this approximate number uniformly for all the basins the flood flows were computed as shown in the last column in table 1 based on these computations gross floods flows in all river basins are estimated at 180 billion cubic meter bcm many storage projects have been constructed in some river basins such as the krishna narmada mahanadi cauvery and godawari where substantial water is conserved nevertheless there is scope to further conserve much more flow further for the brahmaputra basin the utilizable flows are estimated at 25 bcm but more water can be conserved utilized in this basin by following the policy of store and divert it is seen from table 1 that significant quantities of flood flows are present in about eleven river basins note that even though a large river basin may be water surplus on gross level there may be local water deficits for example ganga river basin has high flood flows but many sub basins face water scarcity in the dry season some basins such as krishna cauvery and narmada already have good storage capacity and the possibility of water conservation through new large storage s is limited in view of unfavourable opinion about large dams in india it is assumed that the existing reservoirs are already conserving about 30 of the flood flows and to account for this net flood flows have been reduced by 0 3 storage capacity created in a particular basin thus the net flood flows turn out to be 122 bcm it is assumed that rivers in arid regions such as sabarmati mahi and pennar do not have appreciable flood flows and length of east west flowing rivers in plain areas is quite small as expected some basins notably ganga brahmaputra godavari and mahanadi have substantial flood flows some of this water can be conserved within the basin and some part can be diverted to areas facing water shortages thereby simultaneously addressing the problems due to excess and deficit of water diversion of water is discussed in more details in a later section these actions can help saving using about 122 bcm of water which can be very beneficial since currently gross water demands in india are about 700 bcm note that the estimates mentioned here are ballpark numbers that need to be firmed up by detailed surveys investigations and impact assessment 2 1 impact of climate change and human interventions on flood flows most indian river basins are highly vulnerable to climate change climate change will impact these basins through changes in rainfall pattern and intensities temperature rise would impact snow fall and snow glacier melt demands for water and rise of sea water level will impact submarine groundwater discharge and intrusion of salinity in coastal aquifers temperature projections for india are in line with the global trends and in general increased warming is expected across all the rcp scenarios projections of precipitation for the indian region given by ipcc 6 show that with increasing concentration of greenhouse gases and moving forward in time magnitude and variability of precipitation will increase for india this will lead to more instances of floods and droughts many researchers have tried to understand the impacts on individual or group of river basins by using climatic and hydrologic models the ganga brahmaputra basin is a highly vulnerable zone due to climate change impact since it receives much snow and melt of snow and glaciers is impacted by warming gain et al 5 investigated the impact of climate change on flows of the lower brahmaputra region they created a weighted ensemble of transient stream flow by using the outputs from multiple models for 1961 2100 based on this data and long term observed flow data at bahadurabad station in bangladesh it was found that in future extreme low flows are expected to become less frequent but peak flows are likely to increase significantly shah and mishra 21 studied changes in hydroclimatic variables in 18 indian river basins by analysing long term 1901 2012 data it was reported that in the period 1948 2012 precipitation in the monsoon season decreased in 11 basins out of 18 trends were with statistically significant in one basin surface water availability and et declined in eight basins among these the decline was significant in four basins nepal 11 assessed the historic and projected trends in climate for the koshi river basin by statistical analysis he used data for the period 1995 to 2096 from the regional climate model known as providing regional climates for impacts studies precis and the a1b climate scenario to project the impacts of climate change for two temporal windows mid century 2040 2050 and late century 2086 2096 it was reported that snowfall and snow storage is likely to fall due to rising temperature and snowmelt runoff from non glaciated areas will fall further the annual discharge will increase by 13 by the mid century and will subsequently fall slightly evapotranspiration is expected to rise by 16 by the end of the century a study of upper narmada basin by use of the global water availability assessment gwava model 17 found that the hydrological regime in the basin is likely to intensify over the next 50 years due to climate change which will lead to long term increases in river flows in the monsoon season it is expected that climate change will have little impact on dry season flows thus broadly due to climate change the flows of indian rivers and their variabilities will increase in future in addition to climate change two other distinct human interventions will impact flood flows land use land cover changes lulc and storages diversion withdrawals in case of lulc the dominant change will be conversion of forest and agriculture lands to urban areas these changes will cause reduction in infiltration more surface runoff and sharper and higher hydrograph peaks upstream storages diversion and withdrawals will reduce the volume of flood flows at a downstream location of course the extent of changes will depend on the size of interventions and the way these are managed in many indian river basins groundwater levels have fallen substantially due to large withdrawals for irrigation and this has begun to impact river flows in my opinion depletion of groundwater levels would not have large impact on flood flows 3 ways to conserve flood flows a number of means can be adopted to conserve flood flows ranging from large storages to small ponds water transfer and aquifer storages each of these means is discussed here in details 3 1 conserving water by large and medium storages large and medium size storage projects have the potential to significantly control flooding in the downstream area by conserving large quantity of damage causing water besides flood control the conserved water is also used to meet some other demands use of storages to even out the fluctuations in river flows due to monsoonic climate is an attractive option in india keeping in view the availability of water good sites perception about large projects and environmental concerns construction of major projects with storages of more than a few billion cubic meters is becoming progressively tedious in india of course the possibility of constructing projects of medium and smaller sizes is high and should be pursued put together a number of such projects in different basins may help conserving substantial volumes of flood waters regulation policies for all the projects in a river basin should be developed by treating them as a single system for realizing the best possible gains as far as reservoirs are concerned major states of india such as maharashtra karnataka madhya pradesh orissa telangana andhra pradesh and gujarat account for major share of reservoir capacity in india these reservoirs tap the waters of major rivers namely krishna godavari mahanadi narmada and cauvery there is a possibility of harnessing significant quantity of flood waters in ganga brahmaputra godavari and mahanadi river basins storages could be constructed on those tributaries of these rivers that carry large flows most suitable sites storage for storage development are in mountains where land submergence for the given volume of storage is less compared to the plain areas it is noted that storages will be an essential component of a proposal to transfer large quantities of water however construction of storages on the northern tributaries of ganga river that come from nepal and carry large quantities of flows will require that the transboundary issues are settled based on the performance appraisal of 383 flood control reservoirs and 8500 mile of levees in the usa comiskey 3 found that these structures have prevented about 710 billion in flood damages estimates adjusted for inflation from 1928 to 2000 he concluded that for every dollar spent on the construction of flood reduction projects about 6 in potential damages from flooding has been averted during the past six decades up to year 2000 i could not locate a similar study on the performance of indian reservoirs more discussion on this topic and use of this water is given in a later section 3 2 water conservation by ponds and wetlands in india tanks and ponds are traditional sources of conserving water to meet daily needs for drinking sanitation irrigation etc in fact most villages or neighbourhoods would have a tank for providing water for these purposes ponds and wetlands also aid in ground water recharge and promote bio diversity over the time due to population pressure and neglect many ponds were filled up fully or partially for example as per wikipedia the area of water bodies of the bangalore city has reduced from 2324 ha in 1973 to just about 1005 ha in 2005 in most places the reduction in water area has been due to encroachment or change in land use table 2 gives the numbers and areas of small medium and large reservoirs in various states of india further detailing of small reservoirs and irrigation tanks in given in table 3 the total area of small inland water bodies is unevenly distributed over india five states orissa andhra pradesh gujarat karnataka and west bengal have more than 50 of india s inland water bodies according to the national wetland inventory and assessment report 15 inland natural wetlands accounted for about 43 cent of the total wetland area the number of tanks in india was estimated at about 1 22 lakh about 5 56 lakh small wetlands including village ponds area 2 25 ha were identified 15 about 65 of total area under tanks and ponds in india lies in andhra pradesh karnataka tamil nadu and uttar pradesh assuming an average depth of 1 5 m the small reservoirs would be conserving about 8 3 bcm of water if an effort is made to expand and deepen these bodies dig some more and considering recharge during rainy months around 15 bcm of water can be conserved by small reservoirs table 3 shows that irrigation tanks are mostly found in five states tamil nadu karnataka andhra pradesh gujarat and up assuming average depth of water as 2 0 m such tanks would be conserving about 18 7 bcm of water since irrigation tanks have proven to be useful in these states it would be helpful for water security if the tank culture is developed in other water stressed states also particularly in maharashtra orissa rajasthan punjab and haryana hence with persistent efforts to expand the existing tanks and construct new tanks around 15 bcm of additional water can be conserved by irrigation tanks there have been many success stories of pond and lake rejuvenation in various parts of the country these isolated efforts need to be scaled up significantly rejuvenation of small water bodies can immensely help in achieving water security and resilience to mitigate climate change to that end several steps need to be taken it is high time that a database of ponds wetlands with coordinates water spread area storage capacity and other pertinent variables is prepared so that their full potential is exploited in a systematic and planned manner numerous ponds across the country have been encroached upon based on old records and field visits such ponds need to identified and salvaged however salvaging encroached ponds involves law and order problems as the squatters seldom move away easily field visits will also help in identifying the locations where new ponds tanks can be developed and then take up such works under various schemes of the government gis database with layers of dem data soil data layer rainfall data layer and geologic maps would be of immense value in this effort 3 3 use of flood plains many rivers and their tributaries originating in mountains have vast flood plains when the river is about to end its mountain run or after it emerges from the mountain reaches and enters in plain areas for instance rivers such as ganga and its tributaries have wide flood plains at various places along their channels the width of these plains varies from a few hundreds of meters to about a kilometre or even more at a few places a variety of land uses are seen in these flood plains in many places these are just barren stretches of land in some cases these lands are put under cultivation after the flood season by using the residual soil moisture when the river passes through near a city the flood plains are usually occupied by built infrastructure such as houses offices and commercial areas with small interventions many of these flood plains can be used to temporarily hold flood waters as the discharge in the river increases a part of the flow can be diverted towards the flood plains and stored as an example an area of 500 m width 50 km length and with 2 m depth of water can hold 50 mcm of water since soils in these plains typically have high hydraulic conductivity much of this water will rapidly infiltrate in the ground thus the flood plains can effectively conserve water equivalent to several times their storage capacity on a national scale the volume of water conserved would be substantial fig 2 shows flood plains of ganga river near balawali near haridwar uttar pradesh which are suitable locations for conserving flood waters similarly flood plains of tributaries in the hilly reaches can also be used for this purpose fig 2 also shows wide valley of henval a tributary of ganga in uttarakhand where the valley floors can be utilized for conserving flood flows a project called room for the river with the aim of flood damage control was implemented in the netherlands fig 3 the basic premise of the room for the river project is to give more space to the river to flow so that high water levels during floods are confined to the extended flood plains the project implemented at over 30 locations across the netherlands costed 2 3 billion euros tailor made solutions were designed for each river key features of this project were lowering the flood plain deepening the summer bed relocation and strengthening of dykes removing obstacles reducing the height of the groynes and increasing the depth of the side channels another feature of the project was to improve the areas nearby the river banks by constructing fountains and panoramic decks the landscapes are changed and turned into natural sponges so as to absorb excess water during floods 3 4 riverbank filtration rbf riverbank filtration rbf is a technique in which wells are drilled along a river some distance away from the channel and water is pumped out as the river water infiltrates and moves through the soils matrix towards the rbf wells significant parts of dissolved and suspended contaminants are removed from water by the bed sediments in rbf a combination of chemical physical and biological processes work to treat the raw water rbf wells should be placed sufficiently far from the rivers so that the water pumped out has passed for enough distance through the sediments as the rbf wells pump out water a gradient is created towards the well that induces the river water to flow towards the wells studies report very high efficiencies in removing bacteria and heavy metals such as chromium cadmium zinc and lead of course depending upon the properties of the soil aquifer material rbf has been in use in usa and europe for quite some time to supply drinking water sandhu et al 20 examined a number of operational rbf in india and critically evaluated suitability of many potential sites based on hydrogeology and land use they noted that india has large potential to employ rbf technology to supply drinking water to cities located on the banks or rivers and big lakes of course the technology is simple well tested and scalable 3 5 long distance water transfer from the point of view of water and food security water transfer from the surplus to deficit basins areas is an intuitive and attractive option in the long run water transfer would be necessary to achieve sustainable water security to that end a national perspective plan for long distance water transfer called inter linking of rivers ilr was prepared by the national water development agency nwda www nwda gov in this grand scheme consisted of two components himalayan component having 14 links and peninsular component having 16 links a link called mahanadi godavari link was envisaged to transfer surplus water from the brahmaputra ganga and mahanadi basins to southern india to largely eliminate the deficits in krishna pennar cauvery and vaigai basins although the ilr is an attractive and rational scheme it has faced opposition from various groups and individuals on account of political environmental and financial reasons many state governments are not enthusiastic about transfer of water from their territory to other states the cost of the entire scheme is estimated as rs 8440 billion 7 this is a ballpark estimate the actual cost of all the projects may be substantially different than these numbers of course the possibility of implementation of the entire scheme in foreseeable future is quite remote when the ilr schemes were conceptualized ground water availability was not directly taken into consideration over the time the use of ground water for irrigation has increased considerably it is necessary and scientifically correct to consider ground water use to determine the net shortfall of water in a region or river basin also it is high time that the concept of water productivity is introduced in planning accordingly crop water demands should be computed corresponding to the best values of water productivity in the region these two considerations will reduce the required volume of diversions size of storages and link canals thereby reducing the cost of projects further if lesser water is diverted the impacts as well as the opposition to the projects will also be lesser there are many reasons behind slow progress in the construction of ilr projects currently widespread support for the scheme is missing many people consider that ilr will largely overcome many problems due to spatial mismatch between water availability and demands and significantly contribute to water security but many others hold opposite views also in india any water project involving more than one state would require strong support from the central and all state governments and gathering this support will be an uphill task there are also concerns from social and environmental view perhaps the entire scheme is too gigantic see fig 4 many attempts have been made in the past to come up with alternatives but these were not found to be technically or financially feasible the following analysis has been carried out to devise a scheme to overcome large water needs of deficit regions on a sustainable basis without resorting to stopgap arrangements beginning with the basic objective of long distance water transfer the analysis should begin with identification of major regions of water surplus as well as deficits on a national scale based on the examination of the ilr plan of nwda and water availability data in different river basins the places where we have surplus water are manas sankoch sub basins in brahmaputra basin sarda and ghaghra sub basins ganga basin south ganga basin in west bengal jharkhand mahanadi river and godavari river the regions with critical water shortage are south punjab rajasthan and parts of gujarat parts of krishna basin cauvery basin and palar basin in addition many small regions scattered over the country are facing water deficits if the noted regions of water surplus and deficits are connected by efficient water transfer links the demands in the zones of deficits water can be met on a sustainable basis by using the water which is likely to cause flood damages fig 5 shows four such main links 1 sarda to rajasthan north gujarat 2 manas sankosh tributaries of brahmaputra to mahanadi via ganga 3 mahanadi to godavari and krishna and 4 krishna to cauvery and pennar water transfer can be accomplished by open canals pipelines or a combination branch links emerging from the main links or grand canals may supply water to the enroute areas or to nearby deficit zones in terms of the volume of water to be transferred nwda has planned to transfer about 18 bcm of water from sarda to rajasthan gujarat the manas sankosh teesta ganga link will be a massive canal involving diversion of about 40 bcm of water from manas and sankosh rivers in the brahmaputra basin to ganga upstream of farakka this water will augment flows of ganga and some of it will be transferred all the way to south india through mahanadi and godavari rivers the other major proposed routes of diversion are the mahanadi godavari link about 11 bcm of diversion and about 20 bcm of water from godavari river to krishna and down south through a number of links it is seen that the sarda to rajasthan north gujarat main link number 1 broad filled arrow is independent of the other main links for the remaining three volume of transfer by main links 3 broad unfilled dotted arrow and 4 broad unfilled dash dot arrow could be more if main link 2 broad unfilled dashed arrow also becomes operational simultaneously to rationalize the volume of water transfer it would be helpful to adopt the best crop water management practices that will help save the water further right cropping pattern based on soils and climate should be developed in the areas receiving water use of ground water in agriculture needs to be explicitly considered and wherever feasible water should be recycled and reused water supplied should be charged such that the users have an incentive to avoid wastage and the scheme becomes financially viable some type of financial incentive to the donors to be supported by the users can also be thought also on the pattern of power trading there could also be water trading to promote efficient use of water and transparency 3 6 agricultural water management in india about 90 of the water demand comes from the agricultural sector studies have shown that there is huge variation in water productivity among different states and river basins for example fig 6 shows water and land productivity of rice across the indian states this figure shows high variation in the productivity across various indian states water productivity is about 0 7 kg m3 in jharkhand and chattisgarh whereas it is about 0 2 kg m3 in haryana punjab and maharashtra this implies that if the water productivity can be increased in the states where these are low right now about 1 3rd units of water will be required to obtain nearly the same output a range of benefits are possible by enhancing water productivity in the places where water deficits are marginal it may become possible to meet the demands by using the available resources the interlinking proposals were drawn long ago and the requirements to transfer water were computed by using normal water productivity values which were typically low in those times ilr projects are expensive and their cost depends upon the size of various components such as dams and canals the ilr projects should promote and support the best use of each drop of water and to that end the water demands in the receiving areas should be computed by using the best value of water productivity this approach will reduce the amount of water to be transferred thereby reducing the size of various components such as reservoir canals and regulating structure with these changes hopefully the projects will face less resistance such a scenario will be beneficial for water and food security 3 7 underground taming transfer of floods utfi large falls in water tables in many aquifer systems has created vacant space that can hold flood waters underground taming transfer of floods for irrigation utfi is a new approach for mitigating flood impacts that involves diversion of flood waters into storages in depleted aquifers water thus stored in aquifers can be later used primarily to irrigate crops it can also be utilized for other purposes utfi helps in conjunctive management of dams and aquifers it is also beneficial to environment for substantial outcomes and benefits it is best to plan utfi over a larger area and involve local communities in its implementation to assess the suitability of utfi on a global scale international water management institute iwmi has carried out a global scale spatial analysis to identify areas that are highly suitable for implementing utfi 16 1 three sites were studied ramganga in india awash in ethiopia and chao phraya in thailand authors mentioned that the results from their study will help identify the broad areas for more detailed studies to ascertain with higher confidence the technical and economic feasibility of utfi reddy et al 18 reviewed the existing institutional approaches concerning management of utfi in south asia they propose a new institutional framework for mainstreaming management of utfi for this region managed aquifer recharge should be integrated with long distance water transfer plans since the link canals will pass through some of the places that have seen dramatic fall in water tables in recent times such a convergence of schemes will help increase benefits and solve multiple problems natural depressions can be identified from dem and used to recharge aquifers for a natural recharge pond which dries periodically and the bottom is cleaned the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the soil governs recharge typical conductivity values are about 0 3 m day for sandy loams 1 m day for loamy sands 5 m day for fine sands and 10 m day for coarser sands recharge rates of course depend on many factors such as the water depth in pond ground water level gradient pond bottom clogging etc evaporation rates from such bodies vary from 0 3 m year or less in cold humid climates to about 2 5 m year in warm dry places thus evaporation losses are quite small compared to infiltration and during warm periods when evaporation rates are very high such ponds may be dry just to understand approximate values in real life christy and lakshmanan 2 reported that a pond of size 8 m 8 m 1 75 m in a saline aquifer north of chennai recharged about 98 m3 of water from september 2012 to may 2013 the region had quaternary formation it consisted of clay silt sand and gravel and their admixtures the top of the sequence consists of sandstone of about 45 60 m thickness these are underlined by carbonaceous shales of upper gondwana the price of water recharged from this pond worked out to about rs 0 225 per litre clearly better returns will be possible from larger systems 3 8 comparative study of water conservation measures a range of approaches have been proposed in this paper for flood control and conservation of flood water the options suggested vary in size from large storage to farm ponds the impacts will vary from local scale to a large region funds requirement will vary from a small amount to billions of rupees further the impacts on the environment and society risks skills required to construct and operate and the actors associated with the project will vary over a huge range table 4 contains a brief appraisal of various options based on these parameters it is clear that each option has some advantages limitations concerns and requirements the suitability or otherwise of an option in a particular place will depend on the extent and magnitude of the problem feasibility hydrological engineering environmental financial and political and the preferences of the society it will not be wise to out rightly reject any option in most situations a bouquet of options is likely to be the best solution among all the options to conserve flood water and improve water security for the nation long distance water transfer if properly implemented and managed can provide the largest contribution to water security at the national scale china has implemented the south to north water transfer project which is transferring large quantities of water from water surplus south to water deficit north and enhancing water security in india a big hurdle to any national level project will be lack of consensus among the key players and requisite finances here it is comparatively easier to build intra state water transfer projects which can enhance water and food security but for a small region only grey and sadoff 24 examined water security achieved by various countries the paths they adopted and the price they paid based on hydrological typologies they classified the countries in three groups those that have harnessed hydrology countries hampered by hydrology and countries that are hostage to hydrology india falls somewhere in the middle group and would require large investment in institutions and infrastructure to achieve water security for its citizens vorosmarty et al 25 presented a comprehensive analysis of approaches to meet water security threats by blending natural and engineering solutions they demonstrated that future global water security can be achieved by following policies that support blended green gray approaches and a strategic commitment to preserve natural capital is necessary in absence of these the costs of hydrological infrastructure and services is likely to rise significantly this paper has also suggested a blend of green and engineering measures for achieving water security for india 4 final remarks and conclusions techniques for flood management can be broadly classified in two groups structural and non structural flood risk can be expressed as 1 risk hazard vulnerability structural methods such as reservoirs and embankments try to manage the hazard part of the risk and non structural such as flood forecasting flood plain zoning the vulnerability part of course there is some overlap also in the risk reduced by both methods both methods have their advantages and limitations but the structural methods while managing flood risk can also conserve the resource water and this is a very welcome feature of these techniques jain and singh 10 provide a detailed discussion on this topic this paper suggests that flood flows should be seen as a resource in india that need to be conserved for subsequent utilization and contribute to water security such an action and change in approach to manage floods will go a long way in providing water security to the nation in this paper structural or supply side measures for flood risk reduction and helping with water security have been examined i have tried to estimate the volume of flood flows in major indian rivers and have suggested some ways by which the flood flows can be conserved and converted into a useful resource some new techniques such as utfi and rbf have the potential to help in sustainable water resources management besides yielding environmental and social benefits conserved flood flows can also be used to recharge depleted aquifers thereby contributing to sustainabile use of ground water and increased baseflows in rivers some techniques presented here can be implemented by involving public to help with employment livelihood concerns resources from the ongoing programs such as mnrega can also be utilized for the related works a comparative assessment showing the merits demerits impacts and concerns for the various options to conserve water and control floods have been presented in terms of size scale of impacts and other factors the suggested options have a huge range to provide water security to a big country a wide range of options covering supply as well as demand side management need to be examined a careful combination of different measures would go a long way in providing sustainable water security to the people of india declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments the author would like to thank the indian institute of technology roorkee for making available the requisite facilities while working on this paper he would also like to thank the reviewers and the section editor for insightful comments that helped in improving the paper
