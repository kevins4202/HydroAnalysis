18280,because the functions of these water and resource recovery facilities wrrfs stretches beyond simply meeting effluent requirements i e also includes optimisation of products to be generated as recovered resources a high level of accuracy is required in using mathematical models that virtually replicate hence predict wrrf system responses to dynamic conditions the currently developed mathematical models embrace the majority of advances made towards tracking nitrogen n and phosphorus p through the entire wrrf and significant effort has been made towards calibrating them to predict realistic outcomes this paper presents the stepwise calibration of the pwmsa model ikumi et al 2015 for aerobic aerd and anoxic aerobic digestion aad processes through predictions of i mineral

keywords phosphorus removal activated sludge anoxic aerobic digestion plant wide modelling 1 introduction for conventional methods of tertiary sludge treatment processes wastewater treatment systems could adopt either anaerobic digestion ad or anoxic aerobic digestion aad technology shao et al 2013 banjade 2008 the ad systems offer energy savings but are less robust and result in high nutrient concentrations within the dewatering liquor ekama 2017 christensen et al 1984 ideally these nutrients could be utilised towards production of fertiliser e g via processes such as struvite formation or get transferred to delicately poised biological systems like sharon ammanox macura et al 2019 kominko et al 2018 jamil et al 2006 however these nutrients often they get recycled upstream to the parent activated sludge unit operations this necessitates dosage of readily biodegradable organics to the anaerobic and anoxic zones of the activated sludge as systems for effective nutrient removal ekama 2017 to assess the impact of operation strategies and to optimise nutrient removal in these systems requires the utilisation of predictive mathematical models that can simulate the sludge treatment processes with reasonable accuracy solon et al 2019 similar to ads the aad of phosphorus p rich waste activated sludge was raises research questions regarding the rate of release of p from the biomass p and polyphosphate pp on the 3 phase aqueous gas solid mixed weak acid base chemistry of aad systems i e i are the p and metal mg2 k ca2 content of pp released rapidly from p accumulating organisms paos as noticed in ad or gradually with pao endogenous respiration and ii are their concentrations once released in the aqueous medium sufficient for formation of mineral precipitates this paper presents the results from a three phase aqueous solid gas mixed weak acid base kinetic model developed by ikumi et al 2015 when applied to simulate the biological physical and chemical processes occurring in dynamic batch aerobic anoxic and anaerobic sludge treatment conditions a model calibration procedure is applied whereby the data generated from various experimental investigations are matched against the model s capability to predict the main biological and chemical processes in this sludge treatment including the endogenous respiration of the ordinary heterotrophic organism oho and pao biomass organic utilisation nitrification pp release and mineral precipitation 2 materials and methods the selection of batch tests towards the model calibration exercise is performed by stepwise isolation of the relevant processes i e physical and chemical processes of gas stripping and precipitation respectively followed by biological processes of endogenous respiration nitrification and polyphosphate release the calibration exercise is done this way towards accurate determination of the kinetic parameters of importance 2 1 experimental set up and data the dynamic

anaerd bt8 iv results presented by harding et al 2010 batch ad tests on ndbepr was to calibrate the ad model for the kinetics of ad op release including that from pp breakdown and mineral precipitation with the inclusion of ad bioprocesses ad bt1 detailed descriptions of these experimental systems used towards calibrating this model are provided prior to presentation of the results in the respective sections below for the batch tests completely mixed reactors were set up with stirrers in the form of paddles driven by electric motors mounted on top of the reactor lids to mixed the sludge continuously for aerobic batch tests the batch reactors were also fitted with dissolved oxygen do probes valves oxygen utilisation rate our meters and humidified air supply fig 1 shows a typical set up for these batch reactors all batch test samples were 50mℓ unless otherwise stated these samples were centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10min the supernatant 0 45 μm membrane filtered the solids tested for concentrations of volatile suspended solids vss total suspended solids tss and the filtrate tested for free and saline ammonia fsa nitrates no3 and op the batch reactors maintained a monitored ph and volume control and sludge mass loss due to sampling was taken into account table 1 below provides a summary of the experimental systems used towards calibrating this model also

magnesium mg potassium k and calcium ca along the unit processes of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp it comprises three sub models integrated for simulation of the entire wwtp under various configurations e g ndbepr as system linked to an ad or an anoxic aerobic digestion aad for was stabilisation these sub models include 1 the ionic speciation model brouckaert et al 2010 this model includes pairing of ionic components and inter phase transfers of component species 2 the asm2 3p model this is the activated sludge model no 2 asm2 henze et al 1995 modified to include the ionic speciation model brouckaert et al 2010 the inorganic settleable solids iss model of ekama and wentzel 2004 and including multiple mineral precipitation according to musvoto et al 2000a b 3 the sdm3p model this is the uct sludge digestion model uctsdm sötemann et al 2005a b c modified to include the hydrolysis of multiple organic sludge types primary sludge ps ndbepr was and ps was blends the ekama and wentzel 2004 inorganic suspended solids iss model multiple mineral precipitation processes according to musvoto et al 2000a b and the brouckaert et al 2010 aqueous speciation model which facilitates ionic speciation ikumi 2011 for their compatibility the asm2 3p and sdm3p models have the same comprehensive set of model components supermodel approach volcke et al 2006 including parameterized stoichiometry for the bioprocesses and sharing the same ionic speciation subroutine model 1 2 3 model evaluation process the model evaluation process is presented by ikumi et al 2014 which was based on the adoption of biomath protocol developed by vanrolleghem et al 2003 this process involved i the systematic model verification method proposed by hauduc et al 2010 to check material cod c h o n p mg k and ca mass balances ii preparation of initial parameter values determined experimentally or obtained from literature and given their typical range using the method proposed by brun et al 2002 iii evaluation of parameters using a the standardised regression coefficients src and b morris screening methods this resulted in prioritised model parameters the ones with great effects the determination of non influential parameters those that can be fixed at any range without influencing model variable outputs and quantified degrees of interaction between parameters that intricately worked together to influence model output results neumann 2012 in the final step iv of model calibration and validation non influential parameters were set at their default values and random samples were drawn from the remaining subset of parameters for the sampled parameter sets simulations were conducted and predicted model outputs were compared with observed outputs during this calibration phase a consistent set of parameter values was used to simulate all experimental systems periods and detailed explanations of observed discrepancies if any were reported by ikumi et al 2015 the sensitivity analysis together with intuitive observation on a steady state stoichiometric model played a significant role in selecting the best set of parameters however using this selected set of parameters to model the different unit processes in this case both ndbepr and aad systems required versatility in the asm2 3p model kinetics to simulate the variation in unit processes 3 results and discussions the pwm sa model ikumi et al 2015 is used to simulate both the ndbepr parent system and the batch digestion tests the model calibration process was done via systematic isolation of relevant processes according to the emphasis placed on different variables for each experimental data set the model predicted results are compared to experimental measurements firstly for mineral precipitation excluding bioprocesses then bioprocesses excluding the precipitation and finally for the combination of bioprocesses and mineral precipitation i e the biological chemical and physical processes to simulate the given experimental scenarios with the asm2 3p model a pre processor calculations done in ms excel to reconcile experimentally measured data towards determination of input model component and parameter values was set up that could calculate the initial conditions day zero of the batch reactor by wastewater and sludge characterisation procedure of ikumi 2011 these results include volatile suspended solids vss to match the sum of all particulate organics total phosphates tp to match the sum of all components containing p including pp and orgp and op iss to match the mass concentration of pp and reactor accumulated influent iss etc 3 1 mineral precipitation calibration against musvoto 1998 aerobic batch test 5 data a batch aerobic test amongst the ones operated by musvoto 1998 provides useful data towards validation of models for chemical and physical processes of precipitation and gas stripping the aerobic batch experiment was conducted on the anaerobic digestion supernatant ads from an ad operated at 20 d sludge age in cape flats wastewater treatment works cf wwtw in south africa the ad was fed a blend of ps and was from a 5 stage bardenpho as system treating municipal sewage its effluent sludge was sampled directly into sealed pressurised containers with care taken to ensure no co2 loss which were stored at 20 c five litres of the ads decanted from the containers were placed in batch reactors and 100 mg l of ca mg and p as ca mg and p from cacl2 mgcl2 and k2hpo4 respectively were added to the supernatant prior to its aeration to ease co2 loss concerns the ads was sparged with co2 ch4 60 40 gas mixture typical of ad this was done until the ph dropped to a constant value after about 5 10 min and the initial sample taken immediately after the supernatant was then aerated using compressed air passed through a diffuser stone in the batch reactor for above 24 h and its ph continuously monitored this experimental set up was simulated using the pwm sa model to calibrate the model against the provided data for chemical precipitation and gas stripping processes table 2 a and b provides the determined set of significant parameters and their values that allowed the best match between experimental and simulated variables see fig 2 for the comparison of measured and simulated outputs as notable from fig 2 most pwm sa predicted results op mg ca ph and h2co3 alk are closely matched to those measured by musvoto 1998 the poor correlation between measured and simulated fsa fig 2f is attributed to testing for fsa after vacuum filtration musvoto 1998 noted that this vacuum filtration resulted in the stripping of ammonia as would occur with reactor aeration this was not captured in the predictions because the ammonia was stripped outside of the confines of the experimental environment virtually replicated by the reactor and better predictions would be obtainable with the sample analysed before vacuum filtration the poor correlation between the measured and simulated hco3 is linked to the ammonia loss during the filtration process the conversion of ammonia to nitrates which is deemed to have occurred during the filtration process results in ph and alkalinity reduction i e nh 4 2 o 2 no 3 h 2 o 2 h where the carbonate weak acid base system plays a significant role in the availability of h ions for system ph adjustments i e 2 hco 3 2 h 2 h 2 co 3 hence the hco3 which contributes significantly to the system h2co3 alkalinity is lower measured where ammonia to nitrate conversion took place during sample filtration than the predicted value where the virtually replicated experimental environment did not cater for the aeration during sample filtration moreover it was noted that the initial sparging of the ads with co2 ch4 did not affect the h2co3 alkalinity but instead allowed for struvite precipitation at low ph and solubilisation of a calcium containing compound possibly calcium carbonate caco3 this decreased mg but increased ca concentrations respectively and was taken into consideration during the model calibration process simulating this aerd of ads process is taken as a step in the model calibration exercise whereby the focus is distinctly towards accurate prediction of mineral precipitation potential without the interference of biological reactions the closely matched results provide reasonable evidence that the model is capable of reproducing these results for similar reactor conditions using the selected kinetic and stoichiometric constants 3 2 bioprocesses calibration against mebrahtu 2007 aerobic batch test 8 data mebrahtu et al 2007 carried out eight aerobic batch digestion tests on was from the laboratory scale membrane mbr uct ndbepr at a controlled ph of 7 2 and in the temperature regulated 20 c water research laboratory of the university of cape town uct the mbr uct ndbepr system that provided the was was operated at steady state by du toit et al 2010 at a sludge age of 20 days and a high aerobic reactor tss concentration of about 20gtss l six of the eight batch tests were performed in a 5 l aerobic digester while the last two batch tests were carried out in parallel using two separate 3 l aerobic digesters one with concentrated was 20gtss l and the other with was diluted 5 times 4gtss l the influent cod concentration fed to the parent ndbepr system was 800 mgcod l real wastewater to which 200 mgcod l of acetate was added to increase pao growth to maintain the 20 day sludge age 2 85 l day of mixed liquor was was harvested from the aerobic reactor mebrahtu et al 2007 noted that struvite precipitation took place in the concentrated batch tests these were the 1st 3rd and 7th of eight batch tests performed and not in the diluted batch test bt 8 to calibrate the pwm sa model towards its capability of predicting the aerd bioprocesses including nitrification op release and endogenous respiration without the influence of mineral precipitation it is simulated against the conditions of this diluted 4gtss batch test bt8 the results from this calibration exercise are presented in fig 3 below the comparisons between the results simulated by the pwm sa dynamic model and measured data from the batch test fed 20gtss ndbepr was but diluted 5 times to 4gtss exhibit close correlations between the measured and predicted data prior to simulation during the pre processing of input components from the measured digester starting point data it was noted that with pp present the measured tp values seemed to indicate a lower than expected corresponding iss concentration pp contributing significantly to the iss ekama and wentzel 2004 moreover the values did not reflect the dilution of 20gtss to a fifth of the concentration therefore due to the spurious tp data the iss was alternatively used to determine the concentration of influent pp this was done as shown in data reconciliation methods by ikumi 2011 as input component for the pwm sa model simulations this resulted in the asm2 3p having a better match of effluent op and similar effluent iss concentrations to those experimentally measured to match the predicted p release in the diluted bt8 in which no precipitation took place the polyphosphate lysis rate bpp is reduced from the value of 0 2 d from henze et al 2000 to a value of 0 03 d therefore it is notable from these low pp release kinetic constants that in aerobic digestion the paos can be modelled to remain alive still withhold their stored pp and release it at a similarly slow rate as associated with pao endogenous respiration this release behaviour is completely different to that in ad where all the pp was rapidly released in about 5 7 days harding et al 2010 see section below the kinetic constants used for the endogenous respiration process of ohos and pao biomass allowed for simulation of vss concentrations that are reasonably well matched to those measured for the organic degradation during the aerd bt8 consequentially there is also a close match in declining trends of total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn of fig 3d via reduction of the organic vss bound n orgn during this aerd bt8 nitrification is only the bioprocess simulated to utilise the ammonia i e convert fsa to nitrates that was made available from breakdown of orgn the ammonia released to aqueous phase could not have been taken up to precipitate struvite mgnh4po4 part of the solid phase tkn because if this had occurred the measured tkn and iss would be higher i e would not match our simulated model predictions that excluded occurrence of precipitation and nitrates which is not measured in tkn would be lower see fig 3 eliminating mineral precipitation potential in this experiment also assists towards calibrating the aad effluent op prediction however further intricacies are brought about by the significant influence of aerobic pp disintegration on the aad effluent op pp which also contributes to the iss generates significantly more op than the organically bound biomass p which is released with the disintegration of biomass organic material and effluent alkalinity the aerobic disintegration of pp results in alkalinity reduction which causes a significant decline in the rate of nitrification mebrahtu 2007 added some sodium bicarbonate to the aerobic batch digestion to ensure a ph value of around 7 2 is maintained without the knowledge of alkalinity added to the system it would be difficult to calibrate the pp breakdown rate without compromising the prediction of nitrates generated and vice versa the simulated results indicate that a reasonable compromise has been made between the nitrates generated and op released the determined set of suitable parameters and their values that allowed the best match between experimental and simulated variables are given in tables 2a and 2b table 3 further describes the parameters that are noted to be significant during the parameter estimation exercise as compared to the ones observed to be significant during the sensitivity analysis process 3 3 chemical physical and biological processes calibrated against musvoto 1998 and vogts 2015 aerobic batch test data for model validation against chemical and physical processes as well as aerobic biological processes musvoto 1998 conducted further aerobic batch tests on a mixture of raw sewage and was from a laboratory scale modified ludzack ettinger mle system i e the pao biomass and pp assumed to be at negligible quantity with addition of ca mg p and fsa this mixture was aerated but because the concentration of carbonate species in raw sewage is very low there was no increase in ph it remained in the region of 7 2 this allowed for the interaction of the precipitation of minerals and the biological processes to be investigated the our was automatically measured with the our meter of randall et al 1991 because continuous aeration was not required to raise the ph during its operation 100 ml and 10 ml samples were drawn at intervals from the batch reactor for analysis the analysis of 10 ml sample included fsa before filtration experience had shown that fsa loss occurs during filtration at high ph the 100 ml sample was filtered immediately through 0 45 μm filters and the filtrate divided into two about 1 5 ml of concentrated nitric acid hno3 was added to one filtered sample to reduce the ph to below 2 and prevent further precipitation this acidified sample was analysed for ca mg and iron fe by emission spectroscopy using the inductively coupled plasma method and total p using persulphate digestion and molybdate vanadate colour reaction standard methods 1985 the fe was found to be low enough to be neglected the other filtered sample was not acidified and was tested for total carbonate and short chain fatty acids determined with measurement of h2co3 alkalinity volatile fatty acid vfa and ph with the 5 point titration method of moosbrugger et al 1993 the pwm sa model simulations of this experimetal set up was matched against the experimental results of musvoto 1998 to calibrate the model processes against conditions where both the aerobic biological in this case excluding paos and pp but including organic removal and nitrification and chemical reactions including mineral precipitation were taking place these results fig 4 are discussed further below together with the results from the similar set up by vogts 2015 vogts 2015 set up two anoxic aerobic digesters aads fed was from the same ndbepr uct as system as for du toit et al 2010 but operated at a sludge age of 10 days and an aerobic reactor tss concentration of about 10gtss l the two aads were fed different concentration of this was one fed concentrated high tss ndbepr was the 10 gtss l was thickened to 20 g ℓ as feed to the high tss aad the other fed dilute low tss ndbepr was the low tss aad feed of 3 g l was made by adding the ndbepr as effluent to dilute the was to about 1 3rd the two aads were operated continuously in order to observe the effect of intermittent aeration cycle 3h aeration on 3h aeration off and p precipitation on n and p removal in anoxic aerobic digestion of p rich including paos and pp was vogts 2015 various batch tests were performed by vogts 2015 on the influent to the aad i e the uct was to calibrate the model further for replication of nitrification and p release kinetics the data from aerobic batch tests 2 and 4 aerd bt2 and aerd bt4 from vogts 2015 was used the aerd bt 2 with 2 l volume of 3gtss was made from adding 700 ml of the 10gtss was to 1 4 l of effluent and aerd bt4 with 2 5 l volume of 2gtss was made from adding 500 ml of the 10gtss was to 2 l of effluent both bt2 and bt4 were kept aerobic aerated for their experimental period of 20 days and had 50mℓ samples taken daily distilled water was used to replace the volume lost the ph for bt4 was controlled at 7 3 to 7 6 with measured addition of a 19 05 g ℓ naoh solution while that of bt2 was not controlled with alkalinity addition and eventually dropped below 7 the same kinetic and stoichiometric constants tables 2 and 3 used for the calibration of the chemical processes see fig 2 and the biological processes see fig 3 were utilised in the simulation of both processes chemical and biological occurring interactively to assess the extent to which potential non linearity would affect the correlation to measured data non linearity is the result of intricacies in output variables due to parameter inter relations within the model processes from the correlations exhibited in figs 4 and 5 it is noted that these model parameters continue to work well under the reactor with integrated biological and chemical processes i e including mineral precipitation a good correlation of vss fig 5a results shows that rate of degradation via endogenous respiration is accurately predicted a further match with the oxygen utilisation results fig 4f validates the model further since the total oxygen demand is the output of three significant bioprocesses i e substrate utilisation nitrification and endogenous respiration further even with the inclusion of struvite precipitation a process that also takes up ammonia the measured nitrates concentration follows the same trend as the simulated values in the results from fig 4 it is noted that although nitrification and struvite formation both require ammonia they both occurred to a given extent according to the calibrated kinetics of the two processes however as noted in fig 4a and b the magnesium and phosphorus precipitation occurred rapidly at the beginning of the batch test and then redissolution occurred allowing the mg and op to be released back in the aqueous phase hence the decline and increase in their concentrations however the ammonia continuously declined and nitrate formation increased with the increased retention time this allows for some confidence towards the model replication of the system performance in tracking n i e according to the process kinetics the right portions of ammonia released during organic degradation goes towards struvite precipitation and nitrification processes initially it was expected that k struvite mgkpo4 rather than mgnh4po4 would precipitate with most of the nh4 used in nitrification however measurements of the metals that would be made available with pp release i e mg k and ca showed that only mg and not k participated in the mineral precipitation i e was transformed back from the aqueous to the solid phase the ph prediction post precipitation is very close to that measured because the model is safeguarded against decline in ph that would occur due to nitrification 3 4 chemical physical and biological processes calibrated against vogts 2015 anaerobic aerobic and anoxic batch test data the experimental data from vogts 2015 was used further to calibrate the pwm sa model against conditions of anaerobic aerobic digestion and anoxic digestion of was this was to ensure that accurate predictions could be achieved in cases where very little or no nitrification is occurring in the aerobic phase of the aad according to known pao metabolism reported by wentzel et al 1990 the presence of high op and acetate in alternating anaerobic aerobic conditions could result in the growth pao biomass rather than the exclusive oho pre domination this meant that simulating aads containing mixed cultures of oho and pao biomass requires careful monitoring of the fermentation rate q oho f vfa see tables 2 and 3 to control the quantity of acetate produced hence direct pao growth and the consequential pp storage for further investigations on this aspect vogts 2015 set up anaerobic aerobic batch reactor to calibrate anaerobic p release with acetate uptake and aerobic p uptake after 20d aerobic digestion i e the data is obtained from the anaerobic aerobic batch digester 8 anaerd bt8 this reactor was made up of 1ℓ of the high tss i e fed the ndbepr was thickened form 10 to 20gtss l aad effluent mixed 1ℓ of distilled water with a measured dose of sodium acetate 5 gch3coona this was 1952 mgcod ℓ in the 2ℓ final batch test volume dissolved in it the batch reactor was mixed without aeration anaerobic conditions no nitrates present for 3h and then aeration was switched on for 3h i e the test was carried out over 6h during the 6h batch test hourly samples were taken and the reactor ph was monitored and maintained between 7 3 and 7 7 by adding measured doses of 1n naoh and hcℓ the results vfa which is taken up and op which is expended to be released from simulation of this experimental set up are shown in fig 6 it is noticeable here that the model can reproduce the data within reasonable range from fig 6 above it is notable that the vfa is being utilised decreasing over time in both the anaerobic and aerobic phases while the op increases during the anaerobic phase first 3 h op released with uptake of vfa for polyhydroxy butyrate formation smolders et al 1995 and then decreases afterwards in the aerobic phase i e in the last 3 h which indicate op uptake to form pp smolders et al 1995 wentzel et al 1990 vogts 2015 performed further batch tests on the effluent to the 20 d r aad to observe the denitrification performance and op concentrations after 20d of aerobic digestion this was the batch test 7 of vogts 2015 that involved the setup of an anoxic batch reactor i e axd bt7 comprising of diluted high tss aad effluent 1 l of the aad sludge effluent diluted with 1 l of dewatering liquor made up of 700mℓ uct effluent and 300mℓ low tss aad i e the one fed 3gtss l supernatant to create the 2l batch reactor volume the mixture was high in nitrates and low in op and the reactor was stirred without aeration anoxic conditions due to nitrates present for 24 h with samples taken at increasing time gaps i e at 5 10 20 30 60min 1 5h 2 5h 3 5h 5 5h the results in fig 7 below show that the model was also able to replicate same trend of nitrate denitrification and op as the system operated by vogts 2015 it can be noted that the nitrates decrease due to denitrification is replicated well together with the op concentration none was released or taken up in this experiment the consistency in op concentrations may be due to significant quantities having already been released during the aad process and the short retention time 7 h available during the experiment to observe any release rapid op releases usually occur in anaerobic zones with availability of vfas while the op release with breakdown of paos is expected to be slow 3 5 review of observed p release during batch anaerobic digestion ad of ndbepr was to observe the rate of phosphorus release in ad harding et al 2010 conducted experimental ad batch tests on the ndbepr was these batch tests were performed using a 5 l continuously stirred mesophilic 35 c ad reactor this reactor was seeded with a 50 50 ratio mixture of ndbepr was to effluent waste sludge from the continuous ad system described above for the 18 day rs operation one batch test was conducted on undiluted ndbepr was 10gtss l the other was diluted five times fig 1 below shows a comparison between the results measured in the undiluted batch test and results simulated with the three phase ad model with and without struvite precipitation fig 8 a to c show that a closer match between experimental and simulated results is made when including struvite precipitation than without precipitation most of the p is released as ortho phosphate op within 4 days after which the p release if any was very slow or gradual this conforms to the observation by jardin and popel 1994 confirming that stored polyphosphate in paos which forms a large portion of the tp content is released within seven days the op simulated for infinite solubility of struvite matches well with that measured in the diluted batch test multiplied by the dilution factor while the op simulated with inclusion of struvite precipitation matches the op measured in the undiluted batch test this validates the capability of the model to predict mineral precipitation during ad the other graphs which show increased tss fig 1b since struvite contributes to inorganic solids concentration in the ad provide further support of the reduced simulated op being due to struvite precipitation the results match well when the kinetics of pp release are modelled such that most of the pp disintegrates rapidly with pha uptake as would occur in the anaerobic phase of the as system however further work is still required to compare whether the rates for pp release in anaerobic phase as is actually equal to that in the ad and also to check the differences in alkalinity and ph brought about by the different reactor conditions ikumi and ekama 2019 in the ad the oho and pao biomass were allowed have rapid death rates and the resulting biodegradable organic particulates bpo are hydrolysed much slower the kinetics of this biomass bpo hydrolysis has been calibrated ikumi et al 2014 however further validation towards the kinetics of pao biomass death in ad and the resulting endogenous mass fraction is required to observe this endogenous death rate and unbiodegradable endogenous fraction could be achieved by further experimental observation of enhanced pao cultures when fed to the ad environments 4 conclusion the experiment al data obtained from literature has assisted in the stepwise calibration of the pwmsa model for aerobic aerd and anoxic aerobic digestion aad processes the calibrated kinetic parameters allowed for the model capability of reproducing the data from the biological processes occurring in the various environments of sludge treatment aerobic anoxic and anaerobic within satisfactory level of accuracy this includes accurately predicting relevant outputs of vss removal and oxygen utilisation which are intricately related to the significant bioprocesses of substrate utilisation nitrification and endogenous respiration occurring during the aad polyphosphate pp lysis kinetics it was notable that during aerd the pp can be modelled to remain withheld by the paos while alive and released with the pao lysis at a similarly slow rate bpp 0 03 d to the pao endogenous respiration 0 04 d this release behaviour is completely different to that in ad where almost all the pp was released in about 5 7 days harding et al 2010 model replication of the system performance in tracking n i e according to the process kinetics the right portions of ammonia released during organic degradation goes towards struvite mgnh4po4 part of the solid phase tkn precipitation and nitrification nitrates formed not being part of tkn processes although in aerd and aad some of the nh4 is used in nitrification n struvite mgnh4po4 is still likely to precipitate with k struvite mgkpo4 precipitation not observed experimentally accurate prediction of the nitrate denitrification and op release in anoxic phase of aad accurate prediction of the op release in anaerobic periods however it is noted that further work may be required to validate pp release in ad systems including observation of the impact of the process on system ph and selecting the correct stoichiometric path and kinetics for accurate prediction of system performance experimentally observing the ad of pao biomass enhanced cultures may be able to address this aspect declaration of competing interest the authors

parameterized stoichiometry for the bioprocesses and sharing the same ionic speciation subroutine model 1 2 3 model evaluation process the model evaluation process is presented by ikumi et al 2014 which was based on the adoption of biomath protocol developed by vanrolleghem et al 2003 this process involved i the systematic model verification method proposed by hauduc et al 2010 to check material cod c h o n p mg k and ca mass balances ii preparation of initial parameter values determined experimentally or obtained from literature and given their typical range using the method proposed by brun et al 2002 iii evaluation of parameters using a the standardised regression coefficients src and b morris screening methods this resulted in prioritised model parameters the ones with great effects the determination of non influential parameters those that can be fixed at any range without influencing model variable outputs and quantified degrees of interaction between parameters that intricately worked together to influence model output results neumann 2012 in the final step iv of model calibration and validation non influential parameters were set at their default values and random samples were drawn from the remaining subset of parameters for the sampled parameter sets simulations were conducted and predicted model outputs were compared with observed outputs during this calibration phase a consistent set of parameter values was used to simulate all experimental systems periods and detailed explanations of observed discrepancies if any were reported by ikumi et al 2015 the sensitivity analysis together with intuitive observation on a steady state stoichiometric model played a significant role in selecting the best set of parameters however using this selected set of parameters to model the different unit processes in this case both ndbepr and aad systems required versatility in the asm2 3p model kinetics to simulate the variation in unit processes 3 results and discussions the pwm sa model ikumi et al 2015 is used to simulate both the ndbepr parent system and the batch digestion tests the model calibration process was done via systematic isolation of relevant processes according to the emphasis placed on different variables for each experimental data set the model predicted results are compared to experimental measurements firstly for mineral precipitation excluding bioprocesses then bioprocesses excluding the precipitation and finally for the combination of bioprocesses and mineral precipitation i e the biological chemical and physical processes to simulate the given experimental scenarios with the asm2 3p model a pre processor calculations done in ms excel to reconcile experimentally measured data towards determination of input model component and parameter values was set up that could calculate the initial conditions day zero of the batch reactor by wastewater and sludge characterisation procedure of ikumi 2011 these results include volatile suspended solids vss to match the sum of all particulate organics total phosphates tp to match the sum of all components containing p including pp and orgp and op iss to match the mass concentration of pp and reactor accumulated influent iss etc 3 1 mineral precipitation calibration against musvoto 1998 aerobic batch test 5 data a batch aerobic test amongst the ones operated by musvoto 1998 provides useful data towards validation of models for chemical and physical processes of precipitation and gas stripping the aerobic batch experiment was conducted on the anaerobic digestion supernatant ads from an ad operated at 20 d sludge age in cape flats wastewater treatment works cf wwtw in south africa the ad was fed a blend of ps and was from a 5 stage bardenpho as system treating municipal sewage its effluent sludge was sampled directly into sealed pressurised containers with care taken to ensure no co2 loss which were stored at 20 c five litres of the ads decanted from the containers were placed in batch reactors and 100 mg l of ca mg and p as ca mg and p from cacl2 mgcl2 and k2hpo4 respectively were added to the supernatant prior to its aeration to ease co2 loss concerns the ads was sparged with co2 ch4 60 40 gas mixture typical of ad this was done until the ph dropped to a constant value after about 5 10 min and the initial sample taken immediately after the supernatant was then aerated using compressed air passed through a diffuser stone in the batch reactor for above 24 h and its ph continuously monitored this experimental set up was simulated using the pwm sa model to calibrate the model against the provided data for chemical precipitation and gas stripping processes table 2 a and b provides the determined set of significant parameters and their values that allowed the best match between experimental and simulated variables see fig 2 for the comparison of measured and simulated outputs as notable from fig 2 most pwm sa predicted results op mg ca ph and h2co3 alk are closely matched to those measured by musvoto 1998 the poor correlation between measured and simulated fsa fig 2f is attributed to testing for fsa after vacuum filtration musvoto 1998 noted that this vacuum filtration resulted in the stripping of ammonia as would occur with reactor aeration this was not captured in the predictions because the ammonia was stripped outside of the confines of the experimental environment virtually replicated by the reactor and better predictions would be obtainable with the sample analysed before vacuum filtration the poor correlation between the measured and simulated hco3 is linked to the ammonia loss during the filtration process the conversion of ammonia to nitrates which is deemed to have occurred during the filtration process results in ph and alkalinity reduction i e nh 4 2 o 2 no 3 h 2 o 2 h where the carbonate weak acid base system plays a significant role in the availability of h ions for system ph adjustments i e 2 hco 3 2 h 2 h 2 co 3 hence the hco3 which contributes significantly to the system h2co3 alkalinity is lower measured where ammonia to nitrate conversion took place during sample filtration than the predicted value where the virtually replicated experimental environment did not cater for the aeration during sample filtration moreover it was noted that the initial sparging of the ads with co2 ch4 did not affect the h2co3 alkalinity but instead allowed for struvite precipitation at low ph and solubilisation of a calcium containing compound possibly calcium carbonate caco3 this decreased mg but increased ca concentrations respectively and was taken into consideration during the model calibration process simulating this aerd of ads process is taken as a step in the model calibration exercise whereby the focus is distinctly towards accurate prediction of mineral precipitation potential without the interference of biological reactions the closely matched results provide reasonable evidence that the model is capable of reproducing these results for similar reactor conditions using the selected kinetic and stoichiometric constants 3 2 bioprocesses calibration against mebrahtu 2007 aerobic batch test 8 data mebrahtu et al 2007 carried out eight aerobic batch digestion tests on was from the laboratory scale membrane mbr uct ndbepr at a controlled ph of 7 2 and in the temperature regulated 20 c water research laboratory of the university of cape town uct the mbr uct ndbepr system that provided the was was operated at steady state by du toit et al 2010 at a sludge age of 20 days and a high aerobic reactor tss concentration of about 20gtss l six of the eight batch tests were performed in a 5 l aerobic digester while the last two batch tests were carried out in parallel using two separate 3 l aerobic digesters one with concentrated was 20gtss l and the other with was diluted 5 times 4gtss l the influent cod concentration fed to the parent ndbepr system was 800 mgcod l real wastewater to which 200 mgcod l of acetate was added to increase pao growth to maintain the 20 day sludge age 2 85 l day of mixed liquor was was harvested from the aerobic reactor mebrahtu et al 2007 noted that struvite precipitation took place in the concentrated batch tests these were the 1st 3rd and 7th of eight batch tests performed and not in the diluted batch test bt 8 to calibrate the pwm sa model towards its capability of predicting the aerd bioprocesses including nitrification op release and endogenous respiration without the influence of mineral precipitation it is simulated against the conditions of this diluted 4gtss batch test bt8 the results from this calibration exercise are presented in fig 3 below the comparisons between the results simulated by the pwm sa dynamic model and measured data from the batch test fed 20gtss ndbepr was but diluted 5 times to 4gtss exhibit close correlations between the measured and predicted data prior to simulation during the pre processing of input components from the measured digester starting point data it was noted that with pp present the measured tp values seemed to indicate a lower than expected corresponding iss concentration pp contributing significantly to the iss ekama and wentzel 2004 moreover the values did not reflect the dilution of 20gtss to a fifth of the concentration therefore due to the spurious tp data the iss was alternatively used to determine the concentration of influent pp this was done as shown in data reconciliation methods by ikumi 2011 as input component for the pwm sa model simulations this resulted in the asm2 3p having a better match of effluent op and similar effluent iss concentrations to those experimentally measured to match the predicted p release in the diluted bt8 in which no precipitation took place the polyphosphate lysis rate bpp is reduced from the value of 0 2 d from henze et al 2000 to a value of 0 03 d therefore it is notable from these low pp release kinetic constants that in aerobic digestion the paos can be modelled to remain alive still withhold their stored pp and release it at a similarly slow rate as associated with pao endogenous respiration this release behaviour is completely different to that in ad where all the pp was rapidly released in about 5 7 days harding et al 2010 see section below the kinetic constants used for the endogenous respiration process of ohos and pao biomass allowed for simulation of vss concentrations that are reasonably well matched to those measured for the organic degradation during the aerd bt8 consequentially there is also a close match in declining trends of total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn of fig 3d via reduction of the organic vss bound n orgn during this aerd bt8 nitrification is only the bioprocess simulated to utilise the ammonia i e convert fsa to nitrates that was made available from breakdown of orgn the ammonia released to aqueous phase could not have been taken up to precipitate struvite mgnh4po4 part of the solid phase tkn because if this had occurred the measured tkn and iss would be higher i e would not match our simulated model predictions that excluded occurrence of precipitation and nitrates which is not measured in tkn would be lower see fig 3 eliminating mineral precipitation potential in this experiment also assists towards calibrating the aad effluent op prediction however further intricacies are brought about by the significant influence of aerobic pp disintegration on the aad effluent op pp which also contributes to the iss generates significantly more op than the organically bound biomass p which is released with the disintegration of biomass organic material and effluent alkalinity the aerobic disintegration of pp results in alkalinity reduction which causes a significant decline in the rate of nitrification mebrahtu 2007 added some sodium bicarbonate to the aerobic batch digestion to ensure a ph value of around 7 2 is maintained without the knowledge of alkalinity added to the system it would be difficult to calibrate the pp breakdown rate without compromising the prediction of nitrates generated and vice versa the simulated results indicate that a reasonable compromise has been made between the nitrates generated and op released the determined set of suitable parameters and their values that allowed the best match between experimental and simulated variables are given in tables 2a and 2b table 3 further describes the parameters that are noted to be significant during the parameter estimation exercise as compared to the ones observed to be significant during the sensitivity analysis process 3 3 chemical physical and biological processes calibrated against musvoto 1998 and vogts 2015 aerobic batch test data for model validation against chemical and physical processes as well as aerobic biological processes musvoto 1998 conducted further aerobic batch tests on a mixture of raw sewage and was from a laboratory scale modified ludzack ettinger mle system i e the pao biomass and pp assumed to be at negligible quantity with addition of ca mg p and fsa this mixture was aerated but because the concentration of carbonate species in raw sewage is very low there was no increase in ph it remained in the region of 7 2 this allowed for the interaction of the precipitation of minerals and the biological processes to be investigated the our was automatically measured with the our meter of randall et al 1991 because continuous aeration was not required to raise the ph during its operation 100 ml and 10 ml samples were drawn at intervals from the batch reactor for analysis the analysis of 10 ml sample included fsa before filtration experience had shown that fsa loss occurs during filtration at high ph the 100 ml sample was filtered immediately through 0 45 μm filters and the filtrate divided into two about 1 5 ml of concentrated nitric acid hno3 was added to one filtered sample to reduce the ph to below 2 and prevent further precipitation this acidified sample was analysed for ca mg and iron fe by emission spectroscopy using the inductively coupled plasma method and total p using persulphate digestion and molybdate vanadate colour reaction standard methods 1985 the fe was found to be low enough to be neglected the other filtered sample was not acidified and was tested for total carbonate and short chain fatty acids determined with measurement of h2co3 alkalinity volatile fatty acid vfa and ph with the 5 point titration method of moosbrugger et al 1993 the pwm sa model simulations of this experimetal set up was matched against the experimental results of musvoto 1998 to calibrate the model processes against conditions where both the aerobic biological in this case excluding paos and pp but including organic removal and nitrification and chemical reactions including mineral precipitation were taking place these results fig 4 are discussed further below together with the results from the similar set up by vogts 2015 vogts 2015 set up two anoxic aerobic digesters aads fed was from the same ndbepr uct as system as for du toit et al 2010 but operated at a sludge age of 10 days and an aerobic reactor tss concentration of about 10gtss l the two aads were fed different concentration of this was one fed concentrated high tss ndbepr was the 10 gtss l was thickened to 20 g ℓ as feed to the high tss aad the other fed dilute low tss ndbepr was the low tss aad feed of 3 g l was made by adding the ndbepr as effluent to dilute the was to about 1 3rd the two aads were operated continuously in order to observe the effect of intermittent aeration cycle 3h aeration on 3h aeration off and p precipitation on n and p removal in anoxic aerobic digestion of p rich including paos and pp was vogts 2015 various batch tests were performed by vogts 2015 on the influent to the aad i e the uct was to calibrate the model further for replication of nitrification and p release kinetics the data from aerobic batch tests 2 and 4 aerd bt2 and aerd bt4 from vogts 2015 was used the aerd bt 2 with 2 l volume of 3gtss was made from adding 700 ml of the 10gtss was to 1 4 l of effluent and aerd bt4 with 2 5 l volume of 2gtss was made from adding 500 ml of the 10gtss was to 2 l of effluent both bt2 and bt4 were kept aerobic aerated for their experimental period of 20 days and had 50mℓ samples taken daily distilled water was used to replace the volume lost the ph for bt4 was controlled at 7 3 to 7 6 with measured addition of a 19 05 g ℓ naoh solution while that of bt2 was not controlled with alkalinity addition and eventually dropped below 7 the same kinetic and stoichiometric constants tables 2 and 3 used for the calibration of the chemical processes see fig 2 and the biological processes see fig 3 were utilised in the simulation of both processes chemical and biological occurring interactively to assess the extent to which potential non linearity would affect the correlation to measured data non linearity is the result of intricacies in output variables due to parameter inter relations within the model processes from the correlations exhibited in figs 4 and 5 it is noted that these model parameters continue to work well under the reactor with integrated biological and chemical processes i e including mineral precipitation a good correlation of vss fig 5a results shows that rate of degradation via endogenous respiration is accurately predicted a further match with the oxygen utilisation results fig 4f validates the model further since the total oxygen demand is the output of three significant bioprocesses i e substrate utilisation nitrification and endogenous respiration further even with the inclusion of struvite precipitation a process that also takes up ammonia the measured nitrates concentration follows the same trend as the simulated values in the results from fig 4 it is noted that although nitrification and struvite formation both require ammonia they both occurred to a given extent according to the calibrated kinetics of the two processes however as noted in fig 4a and b the magnesium and phosphorus precipitation occurred rapidly at the beginning of the batch test and then redissolution occurred allowing the mg and op to be released back in the aqueous phase hence the decline and increase in their concentrations however the ammonia continuously declined and nitrate formation increased with the increased retention time this allows for some confidence towards the model replication of the system performance in tracking n i e according to the process kinetics the right portions of ammonia released during organic degradation goes towards struvite precipitation and nitrification processes initially it was expected that k struvite mgkpo4 rather than mgnh4po4 would precipitate with most of the nh4 used in nitrification however measurements of the metals that would be made available with pp release i e mg k and ca showed that only mg and not k participated in the mineral precipitation i e was transformed back from the aqueous to the solid phase the ph prediction post precipitation is very close to that measured because the model is safeguarded against decline in ph that would occur due to nitrification 3 4 chemical physical and biological processes calibrated against vogts 2015 anaerobic aerobic and anoxic batch test data the experimental data from vogts 2015 was used further to calibrate the pwm sa model against conditions of anaerobic aerobic digestion and anoxic digestion of was this was to ensure that accurate predictions could be achieved in cases where very little or no nitrification is occurring in the aerobic phase of the aad according to known pao metabolism reported by wentzel et al 1990 the presence of high op and acetate in alternating anaerobic aerobic conditions could result in the growth pao biomass rather than the exclusive oho pre domination this meant that simulating aads containing mixed cultures of oho and pao biomass requires careful monitoring of the fermentation rate q oho f vfa see tables 2 and 3 to control the quantity of acetate produced hence direct pao growth and the consequential pp storage for further investigations on this aspect vogts 2015 set up anaerobic aerobic batch reactor to calibrate anaerobic p release with acetate uptake and aerobic p uptake after 20d aerobic digestion i e the data is obtained from the anaerobic aerobic batch digester 8 anaerd bt8 this reactor was made up of 1ℓ of the high tss i e fed the ndbepr was thickened form 10 to 20gtss l aad effluent mixed 1ℓ of distilled water with a measured dose of sodium acetate 5 gch3coona this was 1952 mgcod ℓ in the 2ℓ final batch test volume dissolved in it the batch reactor was mixed without aeration anaerobic conditions no nitrates present for 3h and then aeration was switched on for 3h i e the test was carried out over 6h during the 6h batch test hourly samples were taken and the reactor ph was monitored and maintained between 7 3 and 7 7 by adding measured doses of 1n naoh and hcℓ the results vfa which is taken up and op which is expended to be released from simulation of this experimental set up are shown in fig 6 it is noticeable here that the model can reproduce the data within reasonable range from fig 6 above it is notable that the vfa is being utilised decreasing over time in both the anaerobic and aerobic phases while the op increases during the anaerobic phase first 3 h op released with uptake of vfa for polyhydroxy butyrate formation smolders et al 1995 and then decreases afterwards in the aerobic phase i e in the last 3 h which indicate op uptake to form pp smolders et al 1995 wentzel et al 1990 vogts 2015 performed further batch tests on the effluent to the 20 d r aad to observe the denitrification performance and op concentrations after 20d of aerobic digestion this was the batch test 7 of vogts 2015 that involved the setup of an anoxic batch reactor i e axd bt7 comprising of diluted high tss aad effluent 1 l of the aad sludge effluent diluted with 1 l of dewatering liquor made up of 700mℓ uct effluent and 300mℓ low tss aad i e the one fed 3gtss l supernatant to create the 2l batch reactor volume the mixture was high in nitrates and low in op and the reactor was stirred without aeration anoxic conditions due to nitrates present for 24 h with samples taken at increasing time gaps i e at 5 10 20 30 60min 1 5h 2 5h 3 5h 5 5h the results in fig 7 below show that the model was also able to replicate same trend of nitrate denitrification and op as the system operated by vogts 2015 it can be noted that the nitrates decrease due to denitrification is replicated well together with the op concentration none was released or taken up in this experiment the consistency in op concentrations may be due to significant quantities having already been released during the aad process and the short retention time 7 h available during the experiment to observe any release rapid op releases usually occur in anaerobic zones with availability of vfas while the op release with breakdown of paos is expected to be slow 3 5 review of observed p release during batch anaerobic digestion ad of ndbepr was to observe the rate of phosphorus release in ad harding et al 2010 conducted experimental ad batch tests on the ndbepr was these batch tests were performed using a 5 l continuously stirred mesophilic 35 c ad reactor this reactor was seeded with a 50 50 ratio mixture of ndbepr was to effluent waste sludge from the continuous ad system described above for the 18 day rs operation one batch test was conducted on undiluted ndbepr was 10gtss l the other was diluted five times fig 1 below shows a comparison between the results measured in the undiluted batch test and results simulated with the three phase ad model with and without struvite precipitation fig 8 a to c show that a closer match between experimental and simulated results is made when including struvite precipitation than without precipitation most of the p is released as ortho phosphate op within 4 days after which the p release if any was very slow or gradual this conforms to the observation by jardin and popel 1994 confirming that stored polyphosphate in paos which forms a large portion of the tp content is released within seven days the op simulated for infinite solubility of struvite matches well with that measured in the diluted batch test multiplied by the dilution factor while the op simulated with inclusion of struvite precipitation matches the op measured in the undiluted batch test this validates the capability of the model to predict mineral precipitation during ad the other graphs which show increased tss fig 1b since struvite contributes to inorganic solids concentration in the ad provide further support of the reduced simulated op being due to struvite precipitation the results match well when the kinetics of pp release are modelled such that most of the pp disintegrates rapidly with pha uptake as would occur in the anaerobic phase of the as system however further work is still required to compare whether the rates for pp release in anaerobic phase as is actually equal to that in the ad and also to check the differences in alkalinity and ph brought about by the different reactor conditions ikumi and ekama 2019 in the ad the oho and pao biomass were allowed have rapid death rates and the resulting biodegradable organic particulates bpo are hydrolysed much slower the kinetics of this biomass bpo hydrolysis has been calibrated ikumi et al 2014 however further validation towards the kinetics of pao biomass death in ad and the resulting endogenous mass fraction is required to observe this endogenous death rate and unbiodegradable endogenous fraction could be achieved by further experimental observation of enhanced pao cultures when fed to the ad environments 4 conclusion the experiment al data obtained from literature has assisted in the stepwise calibration of the pwmsa model for aerobic aerd and anoxic aerobic digestion aad processes the calibrated kinetic parameters allowed for the model capability of reproducing the data from the biological processes occurring in the various environments of sludge treatment aerobic anoxic and anaerobic within satisfactory level of accuracy this includes accurately predicting relevant outputs of vss removal and oxygen utilisation which are intricately related to the significant bioprocesses of substrate utilisation nitrification and endogenous respiration occurring during the aad polyphosphate pp lysis kinetics it was notable that during aerd the pp can be modelled to remain withheld by the paos while alive and released with the pao lysis at a similarly slow rate bpp 0 03 d to the pao endogenous respiration 0 04 d this release behaviour is completely different to that in ad where almost all the pp was released in about 5 7 days harding et al 2010 model replication of the system performance in tracking n i e according to the process kinetics the right portions of ammonia released during organic degradation goes towards struvite mgnh4po4 part of the solid phase tkn precipitation and nitrification nitrates formed not being part of tkn processes although in aerd and aad some of the nh4 is used in nitrification n struvite mgnh4po4 is still likely to precipitate with k struvite mgkpo4 precipitation not observed experimentally accurate prediction of the nitrate denitrification and op release in anoxic phase of aad accurate prediction of the op release in anaerobic periods however it is noted that further work may be required to validate pp release in ad systems including observation of the impact of the process on system ph and selecting the correct stoichiometric path and

microbiomes groundwater was dominated by rare species 99 6 of otus accounting for 25 9 of total reads whereas only 26 otus were identified as core species the proximity to the recharge area gave prominence to high microbial diversity coinciding with high surface inputs in downstream direction the abundance of rare otus decreased whereas core otus abundance increased up to 47 suggesting

graham et al 2017 environmental selection is likely to play an important role in dynamic habitats with pronounced environmental gradients whereas neutral processes may govern community assembly in less variable environments verberk 2012 for example pristine groundwater characterized as a comparatively stable environment with low levels of energy and productivity under dark and cold conditions griebler and lueders 2009 akob and küsel 2011 promotes homogenizing dispersal in planktonic community assembly between hydrologically connected sites fillinger et al 2019 whereas deterministic processes dominate dispersal processes in the microbial community assembly of hydrologically connected locations in hyporheic zones with steep physicochemical gradients graham et al 2017 yet microbial ecology in subsurface ecosystems has received less attention although the majority of prokaryotic life resides within the deep subsurface biosphere accounting for 15 of global biomass bar on et al 2018 fractured sedimentary bedrock aquifers that host important groundwater resources are characterized by diverse niches lazar et al 2019 and multiple origins of microbial inhabitants and nutrients due to for instance heterogeneous permeability variable flow velocity doerfliger et al 1999 surface connection and the fossil storages fractures allow for fast translocation of microbes with rapid water flows and minimize the interaction time between microbes and the surrounding rock environment de giglio et al 2016 studies on the biodiversity in such fractured subsurface environments are rare due to their limited accessibility impeding the understanding of subsurface community structures their assembly and their contribution to ecosystem functioning in the hainich critical zone exploratory cze in central germany a hillslope well transect was designed to study the formation of a near surface groundwater microbiome in the widely distributed setting of thin bedded and mixed carbonate siliciclastic alternations küsel et al 2016 kohlhepp et al 2017 previous studies revealed a large functional diversity wegner et al 2019 schwab et al 2017 in the multi storey aquifers kohlhepp et al 2017 and hydrochemical patterns in line with local patterns of nitrification anammox and sulfur cycling wegner et al 2019 schwab et al 2017 however spatial differentiation of the microbial community within the hillslope flow system with its temporal variations of core and rare species were not systematically investigated so far in this study we aimed to disentangle the roles of surface impacts as well as deterministic and stochastic processes in shaping subsurface bacterial community assembly we analyzed spatial and temporal patterns of 16s rrna data of groundwater microbiomes from a three year period with statistical and modeling approaches and linked core groundwater bacterial species to potential hydrochemical drivers our data show pronounced differences in assembly mechanisms

dimensions and materials were reported in küsel et al 2016 the well locations and hydrochemical properties of the groundwater samples were described in supplementary table a1 2 2 sampling of the groundwater groundwater samples were collected on a 3 month basis over three years july 2014 april 2017 from different hillslope positions and depths 5 90 m supplementary table a2 during each sampling

et al 2013 the amplicons were sequenced at lgc genomics gmbh berlin germany based on illumina s miseq platform with standard procedures as described by kumar et al 2017 2 4 bioinformatic analysis the sequence data of both partial bacterial 16s rrna gene amplicons were analyzed using mothur v 1 39 5 schloss et al 2009 following the miseq sop kozich et al 2013 for quality control the sequences that contained ambiguous n bases and homopolymers longer than 8 nucleotides were screened out the remaining sequences were pre clustered to allow for up to 1 bp difference per 100 bp to remove potential sequencing errors before the identification of the chimeric sequences using the uchime algorithm edgar et al 2011 after removing the chimeric sequences the sequences were classified with mothur formatted silva v 132 taxonomy reference database using the default bootstrapping algorithm cutoff value 80 non bacterial otus were removed the remaining bacterial sequences were assigned into otus based on vsearch abundance based greedy clustering agc method at 97 similarity the most abundance sequence of each otu was selected to represent this otu a phylogenetic tree was generated using the representative sequences of each otu based on the relaxed neighbor joining method evans et al 2006 the raw sequencing data were deposited in the european nucleotide archive ena with bioproject ids and accession numbers summarized in supplementary table a3 2 5 statistical data analysis 2 5 1 alpha diversity rarefaction curves supplementary figure a1 built from the data reached saturation for the shannon diversity index at 3000 a value close to the smallest library size of the samples it means that we have a good chance of getting very similar results using shannon with the lowest sequencing depths of 3000 reads per sample to make the sub sampling rarefying repeatable the seed was set to 123 for all analyses hence we normalized the library size by subsampling 3000 sequences per sample prior to calculating the alpha diversity to make the sub sampling rarefying repeatable the seed was set to 123 for all analyses the shannon diversity was estimated using the r package vegan oksanen et al 2007 the faith s phylogenetic diversity was calculated based on the total phylogenetic branch length of each sample using r package picante kembel et al 2010 non parametric kruskal wallis test was used to test the difference of the alpha diversity values between the compared groups dunn test was used for multiple comparisons of the alpha diversity values between groundwater wells using r package fsa ogle 2015 the p values for multiple comparisons were adjusted using the benjamini hochberg method benjamini and hochberg 1995 2 5 2 community composition and beta diversity patterns we used the normalized microbiome counts depth 3000 sequences sample to construct matrices for detecting the overall patterns of bacterial communities based on bray curtis distance silhouette analysis was performed to define the optimum number of microbial community clusters mcluster using r package nbclust charrad et al 2012 pcoa was performed using the r package phyloseq mcmurdie and holmes 2013 permanova was used to assess and validate whether the defined groups of mcluster showed significant differences in bacterial community composition with the default 999 permutations based on bray curtis distance using r package vegan oksanen et al 2007 in order to validate the use of the rarefied data for beta diversity analysis we compared the beta diversity patterns produced from the data normalized by i rarefying at 3000 sequences per sample ii total sum scaling relative abundance tss and iii cumulative sum scaling css using metagenomeseq version 1 24 1 paulson et al 2013 supplementary figure b1 and b2 the function varpart in r package vegan was used to partition the bray curtis dissimilarities of bacterial community data with respect to three explanatory tables such as hydrochemistry the significant hydrochemical parameters identified by the db rda model described above time sampling campaigns and geographic distance calculated as a principal coordinates of neighbourhood matrix pcnm of the latitude and longitude values using adjusted r squared in db rda ordination the significance of the three explanatory factors was assessed with 999 permutations 2 5 3 species rank abundance distribution rank abundance curves were used to illustrate the species distribution patterns in different communities to make the shapes and quantities of rank abundance distribution and quantities comparable between samples all rank abundance distributions were normalized to the same max rank of 373 using r package radanalysis saeedghalati et al 2017 the commonly used rank abundance distribution models wilson 1991 were fitted using r package vegan akaike information criterion aic was used to select the best model for each dataset a classical mds ordination was generated based on manhattan distance to illustrate the structural differences of the normalized rank abundance distributions between the mclusters according to saeedghalati et al 2017 2 5 4 quantification of core and rare species in this study we arbitrarily defined the core species as the bacterial otus that were present in over 80 of the groundwater samples across the transect the rare species were defined as the otus with relative abundance making up less than 0 01 of the bacterial communities in each dataset each mcluster or the whole transect since we used rarefied data for the identification of the core species we didn t perform the microbiome specific models such as edger robinson et al 2010 and deseq2 love et al 2014 and instead used the non parametric kruskal wallis analysis combined with dunn s multiple comparison tests to test the differential abundance agglomerated at the class level of the core species across the different hydrochemical conditions in the groundwater system the p values were adjusted according to benjamini and hochberg 1995 2 5 5 bacterial community assembly to explore the mechanisms that underlie the assembly of groundwater bacterial communities across space a combination of phylogenetic and abundance based null models were used according to stegen et al 2015 2013 assuming that phylogenetically related species share more similar ecological niches than phylogenetically distant species to disentangle the phylogenetic turnover β mean nearest taxa distance βmntd was calculated to quantify the phylogenetic distance between each species in one community and its closest relative in another community with the r package picante kembel et al 2010 to generate the null distribution species names and abundances were randomized across the tips of the phylogeny and βmntd was re calculated for 999 times β nearest taxon index βnti was calculated to represent the difference between observed βmntd and the mean of the null distribution in s d units βnti 2 variable selection βnti 2 homogeneous selection βnti 2 stochasticity when the environmental selection is low βnti 2 re scaled raup crick probability index rcbray chase et al 2011 based on bray curtis distance was calculated to evaluate the compositional turnover under the null hypothesis that the bacterial communities have identical species composition rcbray 0 95 homogenizing dispersal rcbray 0 95 dispersal limitation rcbray 0 95 no dominant assembly process the normalized microbiome counts depth 3000 sequences sample was used for the null model analysis here we only consider the samples taken from the hydrologically connected groundwater wells for spatial community assembly analysis across the upper h42 h43 and h53 and lower h13 h31 h41 and h51 aquifer assemblages 2 5 6 linking microbial communities to hydrochemistry principal component analysis pca was performed to elucidate the spatial patterns of the groundwater wells based on the standardized hydrochemical data z scores distance based redundancy analysis db rda was used to test the relationships between the bacterial communities and the standardized hydrochemical parameters using r package vegan the relationships between the abundance of the core classes the identified core otus merged at the class level and the measured hydrochemical parameters were determined using spearman rank correlation with p values adjusted according to benjamini and hochberg 1995 the abundance of each core class was calculated as the sum of the abundance of the core otus affiliated to this class detailed information on statistical data analysis is provided in supplementary appendix b the r scripts for the relevant analyses are available at https github com pikatech selection shapes 3 results 3 1 environmental selection shaped bacterial communities in the groundwater based on distinct hydrochemical traits groundwater samples clustered into five clusters kohlhepp et al 2017 as shown in fig 1a yet bacterial community composition showed a higher resolution since composition between h41 and the two h3 wells h31 and h32 was significantly different as illustrated in the unconstrained ordination fig 1b permanova p 0 001 the rarefied data produced similar grouping patterns of microbial communities as those normalized by tss and css methods supplementary figure b1 and b2 thus we optimized the number of microbial community clusters mcluster into six supplementary figure a2 according to the silhouette analysis with the groundwater bacterial community of h41 defined as an extra cluster mcluster 6 fig 1b large variations 45 in microbial community data were explained by the defined mclusters as a proxy of spatial effect permanova p 0 001 according to variation partitioning analysis fig 1c differences in hydrochemistry across the transect represented the largest fraction 35 0 of variation in bacterial community composition followed by spatial distance 18 6 both two explanatory matrices significantly affected the bacterial communities p 0 001 and shared 9 1 of variations in bacterial communities across the transect surprisingly the temporal variation in bacterial communities was not pronounced fig 1c and supplementary figure a3 the hydrochemical clusters previously characterized by kohlhepp et al 2017 were confirmed based on the measured hydrochemical parameters of the corresponding 3 month basis samples using a pca plot fig 2 a we used distance based redundancy analysis to investigate the potential hydrochemical drivers of the spatial difference in bacterial communities across the transect among the measured hydrochemical parameters ammonium nitrate dissolved oxygen oxidation reduction potential total inorganic carbon tic iron ii and chloride explained 30 1 of the variance adjusted of the bacterial community data across the transect fig 2b interestingly sulfur or sulfate concentration and electrical conductivity ec which separated h51 away from other wells fig 2a had no significant effect on the bacterial community composition fig 2b in summary the availability of nitrogen compounds and oxygen were the key drivers of bacterial compositional differences across the upper aquifer assemblage the significant hydrochemical parameters ammonium oxidation reduction potential and ph explained 33 6 of the variance of the bacterial community data fig 2c across the lower aquifer assemblage ammonium nitrite and tic significantly altered bacterial communities over space fig 2d however these hydrochemical parameters explained a comparatively low proportion 8 2 of the variance of the bacterial community data in the lower aquifer these explanatory variations between community compositions of the lower and upper aquifers pointed to different mechanisms underlying groundwater community assembly therefore we applied a combination of phylogenetic and abundance based null models to elucidate different impacts of deterministic and stochastic processes on the spatial community turnover between the hydrologically connected wells across the two aquifer assemblages respectively supplementary table a4 indeed the environmental variable selection was the main cause of the higher compositional turnover between the communities across the upper aquifer assemblage just the compositional turnover between the adjacent wells of h42 and h43 which had a similar phylogenetic and compositional structure was mainly attributable to random processes across the lower aquifer we observed high compositional turnover between communities owing to stochastic assembly mainly dispersal limitation the βnti and rcbray values were as similar as expected by chance indicating that the phylogenetic and compositional difference between h41 and h51 communities was mainly attributable to random processes 3 2 the proximity to the recharge area gave prominence to high bacterial diversity in the groundwater characterization of the bacterial community diversity across the transect fig 3 a showed that communities in the upper muschelkalk strata close to the surface recharge outcrop areas were most diverse with an average shannon index of 6 68 0 45 at h14 and 5 77 0 48 at h13 whereas the anoxic wells at the footslope had the lowest diversity h53 4 33 0 46 h52 4 54 0 40 the difference of bacterial alpha diversity between other wells was not significant with average shannon values ranging from 5 71 in h31 to 6 17 in h43 the phylogenetic diversity showed similar spatial patterns as the shannon index supplementary figure a4 all groundwater communities were characterized by a peak and tail pattern of their species rank abundance distributions mcgill and collins 2003 with only a few dominant species and a majority of low abundance rare species supplementary figure a5 especially in well h14 a high number of rare species was observed as indicated by the long tails of the rank abundance curves the dominance pattern was most pronounced in h52 and h53 communities where otu000001 an uncultured member of class thermodesulfovibrionia was highly dominant solely accounting for an average of 13 7 and 18 7 in relative abundance respectively in order to quantitatively compare the structure of the rank abundance distribution between samples of different sampling sequencing depths we normalized the rank abundance distribution based on the maxrank method the first two coordinates of the mds ordination which explained the majority 92 of the normalized distances of the rank abundance distributions fig 3b clearly separated the rank abundance structure into three groups i the upper hillslope group mcluster 1 ii the anoxic footslope group mcluster 5 and iii other mclusters mclusters 2 3 4 and 6 among the popular models tested e g brokenstick niche preemption lognormal zipf and zipf mandelbrot zipf provided the best fit for the normalized rank abundance curves of the bacterial otus for each mcluster with the lowest aic and deviance supplementary figure a5 the decay coefficient the slope of a fitted curve relating the log of relative abundance to the log of rank was lowest for h53 1 1 and highest for h14 0 6 a lower zipf decay coefficient suggests a sharper abundance decrease between the otus with neighboring ranks and a less even species abundance distribution pattern in the corresponding groundwater microbiome in the groundwater microbiome the majority 99 6 in numbers of otus were rare species defined as mean relative abundance below 0 01 and these rare species together represented a mean relative abundance of 25 9 across the transect supplementary table a5 specifically the relative abundance of the rare species declined following the groundwater discharge mcluster 1 25 2 vs mcluster 5 11 1 supplementary table a5 the rare species were largely affiliated to patescibacteria 7 9 in mean relative abundance proteobacteria 6 2 unclassified bacteria 3 2 omnitrophicaeota 1 6 chloroflexi 1 0 and planctomycetes 1 0 supplementary table a6 interestingly the rare species belonging to the third abundant phylum nitrospirae only accounted for 0 4 of relative abundance in the bacterial communities across the transect supplementary table a6 3 3 core groundwater species dominate groundwater in the downstream direction in the next step we identified the taxonomic composition of the dominant groundwater bacteria at the phylum level cand patescibacteria mean relative abundance 33 8 and proteobacteria 24 0 dominated in the groundwater bacterial communities fig 4 a and supplementary table a6 nitrospirae 10 0 was the third abundant phylum but its abundance varied largely in relative abundance across the transect ranging between 0 1 0 1 mean sd in h14 and 22 3 6 6 in h53 at the class level cand parcubacteria was predominant with relative abundance ranging from 11 5 3 5 in h51 to 27 8 8 6 in h32 supplementary table a7 gammaproteobacteria was the second largest class with mean relative abundance ranging from 9 5 2 3 in h32 to 16 3 9 2 in h13 followed by alphaproteobacteria ranging from 1 1 0 6 in h52 to 11 9 9 6 in h13 interestingly thermodesulfovibrionia featured an increasing relative abundance following the presumed fluid flow along the hillslope of the transect fig 4a from less than 0 01 in h1 wells to 21 2 in h53 supplementary table a7 we identified the core species because they were assumed to represent the stable fraction of the groundwater communities regardless of time and space across the transect only 26 core bacterial otus out of 29 658 otus were identified across space and time however these 26 otus were rather abundant together making up 21 6 of relative abundance in the whole community fig 4b these core otus were assigned to 14 classes in 9 phyla proteobacteria 8 otus cand patescibacteria 7 otus nitrospirae 2 otus planctomycetes 2 otu elusimicrobia 2 otus chloroflexi 2 otus actinobacteria 1 otu bacteroidetes 1 otu and gemmatimonadetes 1 otu fig 4b and supplementary table a8 the summed relative abundance of the core otus increased by 8 folds 5 7 in h13 vs 46 8 in h53 from the upper hillslope to the footslope fig 4b when we correlated the distribution patterns of the core otus at the class level to hydrochemical parameters they clustered in four groups mainly according to the availability of oxygen and nitrogen compounds ammonium and nitrate we could assign a core representative for each group the abundance of the core classes in group 1 nitrospira 1 otu assigned to the genus nitrospira jg30 kf cm66 1 otu with no close cultured relative and kd4 96 one uncultured otu was positively correlated with oxygen nitrate electrical conductivity and sulfate fig 4c therefore these core classes were enriched in the oxic lower aquifer wells of h31 h41 and h51 fig 4d nitrospira as the representative for group 1 the abundance of the core classes in group 2 was positively correlated with ammonium ph magnesium and potassium but negatively correlated with oxygen and calcium fig 4c most core classes such as thermodesulfovibrionia 1 uncultured otu gammaproteobacteria 5 otus assigned to acidiferrobacteraceae rhodoferax gouta6 sulfuritalea and tra3 20 respectively cand parcubacteria 3 otus assigned to candidatus kaiserbacteria 2 otus assigned to candidatus nomurabacteria and 1 otu assigned to uba9983 actinobacteria 1 otu assigned to candidatus planktophila and deltaproteobacteria 1 unclassified otu were clustered to group 2 and showed a marked increase of relative abundance following the water discharge fig 4d thermodesulfovibrionia as the representative for group 2 the relative abundance of the core classes in group 3 brocadiae 2 otus assigned to the family brocadiaceae and bacteroidia 1 otu assigned to the genus sediminibacterium were also positively correlated with ammonium but exhibited no correlation with oxygen these core classes were also enriched in the footslope fig 4d brocadiae as the representative for group 3 the abundance of alphaproteobacteria group 4 1 unclassified otu and 1 caulobacteriaceae otu was not correlated with the measured hydrochemical parameters and thus showed a weak abundance difference between wells fig 4d thus most core species displayed a specific preference for certain hydrochemical conditions which varied along the hillslope 4 discussion the composition of the microbial community in fractured sedimentary bedrock is a function of the aquifer s evolution since deposition of the rock of the hydro geological setting e g heterogeneous mineralogy and permeability surface inputs and hydrodynamics e g groundwater flow regime and retention time of the flow systems boyd et al 2007 galand et al 2009 graham et al 2017 bacteria together with soil borne mobile organic matter can be translocated from the surface to the groundwater upon snowmelt and extreme precipitation events zhang et al 2018 dibbern et al 2014 herrmann et al 2019 via passage through the vadose zone and then be further transferred along with groundwater flow however the subsurface establishment of these bacteria in the groundwater depends on the interactions with the local hydrogeological and biogeochemical environment especially the activity of the persistent bacteria at a certain spot will then in return shape their local environment 4 1 environmental selection is responsible for the compositional differences of microbiomes across space our combined statistical and modeling approaches showed that the local hydrogeological settings resulted in different formations of groundwater microbiomes across space microbial community structure revealed more refined spatial differentiation than hydrochemical parameters alone agreeing with the previous groundwater microbiome studies beyer et al 2015 wegner et al 2019 we identified the availability of nitrogen compounds dissolved oxygen and the distance to the surface as main drivers of microbial community composition similar to previous studies of the hainich aquifer system wegner et al 2019 opitz et al 2014 kumar et al 2017 the essential elements for microbial growth such as ca mg k and na present in enough quantities in the limestone mudstone alternations resulted in minor effects on bacterial community composition the increasing decreasing concentration of those parameters along the flow direction is caused by the longer residence and the cross strata water exchange providing hints to the role of flow regime and hydrological structure of the hillslope setting lehmann and totsche under review large variations 59 in the microbiome data could not be explained by the measured hydrochemical parameters the spatial distance or time suggesting that unmeasured hydrogeological properties surface events flow regime and accessibility of habitats due to the heterogeneous hydrogeological structures as wells as other biological interactions e g predation viruses or syntrophy have also played important roles in shaping groundwater microbiomes the null model simulation which took into account both the phylogenetic and compositional turnover has been successfully applied to characterize the dominant assembly processes in groundwater studies e g graham et al 2017 stegen et al 2013 stegen et al 2015 fillinger et al 2019 as the flow velocity is lower in the upper aquifers kohlhepp et al 2017 organisms likely gain enough time to respond and adapt to the local environment the hydrogeological parameters e g ammonium ph and oxidation reduction potential as well as unmeasured factors have likely selected for species with specific traits that facilitated them to outcompete other species in the corresponding habitats contributing to the high spatial phylogenetic turnover across the upper aquifer assemblage the difference in species abundance structures between wells can be used to indicate different assembly processes fuhrman 2009 suggested that the imposing of major stress can drive the otu abundance distribution toward a less even pattern the observed uneven abundance distribution pattern of the bacterial community in the anoxic h5 wells lends strong support to the null model result that environmental variable selection was the overriding community assembly mechanism originally arising from the study of word frequency in language zipf 1932 the zipf s law has been used for modeling the dependency of the number of species on their abundances in highly diverse communities of plants frontier 1985 and bacteria gans et al 2005 under the zipf model the entry of a species into a community is dependent on prior changes in a successional process in which later species are less abundant due to the higher cost of competition than earlier colonizers frontier 1985 in this study the lowest decay coefficient was observed for the rank abundance distribution of mcluster 5 indicating a much higher colonization cost of a new species to enter mcluster 5 than other mclusters the wells h42 and h43 were geologically adjacent wells the low phylogenetic and compositional turnover between these two wells was likely attributable to stochastic changes in population sizes across the lower oxic aquifer dispersal limitation was more important for bacterial community assembly and therefore overruled the visible effects of environmental selection this result is in line with a recent community assembly analysis of bacteria including ultra small bacteria 0 2 μm in the hainich groundwater flow system herrmann et al 2019 the impeded dispersal or exchange of microbes between wells in the lower aquifer might be attributable to the different groundwater recharge sources complex hydraulic flows and cross strata water exchange the marked difference in sulfate concentration between h51 and h41 suggests an extra source of groundwater in h51 in addition to the preferential recharge flow kohlhepp et al 2017 however sulfate was apparently not utilized as electron acceptor due to the high availability of energetically more favorable electron acceptors like oxygen nitrate and nitrite at h51 whether to normalize the data and which data normalization method to use for community data have been a long time debate in this field e g costea et al 2014 paulson et al 2014 every normalization method has its pros and cons and the choice of normalization methods depends on data characteristics weiss et al 2017 rarefying allows a less biased comparison for diversity metrics by removing sampling effects comparing uneven sampling depths but it throws away many rare taxa and may thus reduce the detection power thus we compared rarefying with the other two normalization methods e g tss and css and found that the overall beta diversity patterns did not change which supports the report by weiss et al 2017 that the choice of the normalization methods does not affect the clustering of the groups when the microbiomes differ substantially 4 2 bacteria of near surface groundwater originate from the surface habitats but their survival depends on local interactions we found the highest bacterial diversity in the wells particularly h14 of the upper hillslope near the preferential recharge area groundwater quality shows a fast response to weather events reflected by the higher availability of surface sourced substances such as dissolved oxygen lehmann and totsche under review and likely soil particles and vegetation derived organic carbon after heavy rain and snowmelt events zhang et al 2018 dibbern et al 2014 thus the input of fresh surface materials during recharge events might have stimulated the growth of the opportunistic heterotrophic bacteria in the groundwater resulting in an increase in bacterial diversity however the concentration of organic carbon compounds measured as doc and toc in the groundwater didn t show significant differences between wells over space and time this might imply that bioavailability and or composition of organic compounds rather than total concentration matters to the groundwater bacterial diversity the ubiquity of the well known surface heterotrophs proteobacteria elusimicrobia chloroflexi actinobacteria bacteroidetes and gemmatimonadetes present has been extensively reported for groundwater habitats gülay et al 2016 beyer et al 2015 flynn et al 2013 shirokova and ferris 2013 frança et al 2015 these groups particularly bacteroidetes were abundant especially in the wells particularly h14 of the upper hillslope and are suggested to play crucial roles in the decomposition of complex surface derived materials e g polysaccharides wegner et al 2019 on the other hand bacterial diversity could have been affected directly by recharge events by transporting surface borne bacteria into the groundwater this episodic input of bacteria might be the major source of the groundwater microbiome as only a small fraction 12 of pelagic groundwater genera are found in the rock matrix at the same study sites lazar et al 2019 recently studies have shown that cand patescibacteria are preferentially exported from surface soil to the groundwater upon recharge events which might be due to their ultra small cells herrmann et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 cand patescibacteria the dominant phylum detected in our groundwater system is a superphylum of the uncultivable candidate phyla radiation cpr bacteria that are estimated to constitute up to half of all the global bacterial diversity castelle et al 2018 under the low nutrient circumstances in the subsurface selective pressures on resident microorganisms may mainly be for survival and dormancy instead of resource exploitation madsen 2000 hence the high abundance of cand patescibacteria likely suggests their high dispersal ability and or adaptation strategy with low nutrient and energy requirements for survival in subsurface environments surprisingly cand patescibacteria have not been reported from the rock matrix lazar et al 2019 these findings imply that bacterial diversity in shallow aquifers was most likely introduced from the surface soil habitats besides a small fraction derived from the rock fractures via population exchange we studied the rank abundance distribution to uncover the distinctive distribution patterns i e the dominance and rarity of bacterial species across space we observed a small fraction of dominant otus in the groundwater but a marked majority 99 6 of rare species with low relative abundance in line with other microbiome studies in diverse environments sogin et al 2006 fuhrman 2009 caporaso et al 2011 pedrós alió 2012 galand et al 2009 the ecological roles these rare species play in groundwater processes are unclear but their apparently low abundance does not imply a negligible role in ecosystem functioning shade et al 2018 the rare biosphere may be in the process of dispersal between the neighboring niches in which they may become dominant fuhrman 2009 or rare species serve as genetic reservoirs and are effective opportunists in response to environmental disturbances wang et al 2017 therefore the decreasing abundance of rare species observed at our site and the increasing abundance of dominant species following the discharge reflect both the microbial dispersal and more importantly the environmental selection process we identified only 26 core otus across the transect over time revealing a large spatiotemporal variation in species composition in the groundwater microbiomes however these core otus together represented over one fifth of the whole communities plausibly reflecting their traits of a lifestyle that fit well with the living conditions in the near surface groundwater e g facultative anaerobes autotrophs adaptation to low substrate availability these core otus are likely exported specialists that survived and flourished in the groundwater because they were most competitive under the special subsurface conditions the relative abundance of the core species increased following the groundwater discharge and peaked 35 in the anoxic h5 wells uncovering the increasing importance of the core species in response to the increasing subsurface impact the findings that the abundance of nitrospirae increased markedly along with the groundwater discharge and that only a few species affiliated to this phylum were rare species highlighted the non random spatial distribution pattern of nitrospirae in the groundwater system the genus nitrospira comprises well known nitrifiers and recent studies have found that they possess the metabolic potential to perform the complete oxidation of ammonia to nitrate in oxic conditions pinto et al 2015 daims et al 2015 the abundance of the core nitrospira species was negatively correlated with ammonium but positively correlated with nitrate which might reflect their potential role as nitrite oxidizer and comammox bacteria complete ammonia oxidizer in the oxic groundwater environment nitrospirae affiliated with uncultured thermodesulfovibrionia encode complete respiratory pathways to reduce oxygen and nitrate via the processes of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium and denitrification to nitrous oxide arshad et al 2017 the dominance of the core thermodesulfovibrionia in low oxygen low nitrate and ammonium rich groundwater communities suggested their elevated potential in the nutrient particularly nitrogen turnover in the anoxic footslope wells the high abundance of planctomycetes affiliated with brocadiae in the core communities of the footslope wells was highly associated with the high availability of ammonium at those sites in line with the report that brocadiae play an important role in carbon fixation and anaerobic ammonia oxidizing anammox in the hainich groundwater systems based on multi omics analysis and functional gene analysis wegner et al 2019 kumar et al 2017 starke et al 2017 5 conclusions our data show that both subsurface environmental heterogeneity across space and surface inputs from preferential recharge areas influenced the formation and maintenance of the pelagic bacterial communities in shallow sedimentary bedrock aquifers the episodic input of surface soil derived bacteria appears to be the major source of the groundwater microbiome leading to a high bacterial diversity at wells of the upper hillslope whereas core groundwater species dominated groundwater microbiomes in the downstream direction several lines of evidence suggest that differences in flow velocity between upper and lower aquifer assemblage shaped the dominant assembly process in our groundwater system environmental selection was more prominent in the upper aquifer with a lower flow velocity allowing groundwater bacteria to respond and adapt better to the local environment resulting in a non random spatial distribution pattern of nitrospirae in the anoxic footslope wells here entry of other species into the community requires a much higher cost of competition in the groundwater system across the lower aquifer dispersal limitation appeared to be more important for bacterial community assembly and therefore overruled effects of environmental selection thus flow regime and related accessibility of habitats due to the hydrogeological structure are important

18281,hydrodynamics drives both stochastic and deterministic community assembly in aquatic habitats by translocating microbes across geographic barriers and generating changes in selective pressures thus heterogeneity of hydrogeological settings and episodic surface inputs from recharge areas might play important roles in shaping and maintaining groundwater microbial communities here we took advantage of the hainich critical zone exploratory to disentangle mechanisms of groundwater microbiome differentiation via a three year observation in a setting of mixed carbonate siliciclastic alternations along a hillslope transect variation partitioning of all data elucidated significant roles of hydrochemistry 35 0 and spatial distance 18 6 but not of time in shaping groundwater microbiomes groundwater was dominated by rare species 99 6 of otus accounting for 25 9 of total reads whereas only 26 otus were identified as core species the proximity to the recharge area gave prominence to high microbial diversity coinciding with high surface inputs in downstream direction the abundance of rare otus decreased whereas core otus abundance increased up to 47 suggesting increasing selection stress with a higher competition cost for colonization in general environmental selection was the key mechanism driving the spatial differentiation of groundwater microbiomes with n compounds and dissolved oxygen as the major determinants but it was more prominent in the upper aquifer with low flow velocity across the lower aquifer with higher flow velocity stochastic processes appeared to be additionally important for community assembly overall this study highlights the impact of surface and subsurface conditions as well as flow regime and related habitat accessibility on

habitats hydrodynamics drives both stochastic and deterministic assembly processes by physically translocating microbes across geographic barriers and by generating changes in selective pressures graham et al 2017 environmental selection is likely to play an important role in dynamic habitats with pronounced environmental gradients whereas neutral processes may govern community assembly in

cze in central germany a hillslope well transect was designed to study the formation of a near surface groundwater microbiome in the widely distributed setting of thin bedded and mixed carbonate siliciclastic alternations küsel et al 2016 kohlhepp et al 2017 previous studies revealed a large functional diversity wegner et al 2019 schwab et al 2017 in the multi storey aquifers kohlhepp et al 2017 and hydrochemical patterns in line with local patterns of nitrification anammox and sulfur cycling wegner et al 2019 schwab et al 2017 however spatial differentiation of the microbial community within the hillslope flow system with its temporal variations of core and rare species were not systematically investigated so far in this study we aimed to disentangle the roles of surface impacts as well as deterministic and stochastic processes in shaping subsurface bacterial community assembly we analyzed spatial and temporal patterns of 16s rrna data of groundwater microbiomes from a three year period with statistical and modeling approaches and linked core groundwater bacterial species to potential hydrochemical drivers our data show pronounced differences in assembly mechanisms

dimensions and materials were reported in küsel et al 2016 the well locations and hydrochemical properties of the groundwater samples were described in supplementary table a1 2 2 sampling of the groundwater groundwater samples were collected on a 3 month basis over three years july 2014 april 2017 from different hillslope positions and depths 5 90 m supplementary table a2 during each sampling

et al 2013 the amplicons were sequenced at lgc genomics gmbh berlin germany based on illumina s miseq platform with standard procedures as described by kumar et al 2017 2 4 bioinformatic analysis the sequence data of both partial bacterial 16s rrna gene amplicons were analyzed using mothur v 1 39 5 schloss et al 2009 following the miseq sop kozich et al 2013 for quality control the sequences that contained ambiguous n bases and homopolymers longer than 8 nucleotides were screened out the remaining sequences were pre clustered to allow for up to 1 bp difference per 100 bp to remove potential sequencing errors before the identification of the chimeric sequences using the uchime algorithm edgar et al 2011 after removing the chimeric sequences the sequences were classified with mothur formatted silva v 132 taxonomy reference database using the default bootstrapping algorithm cutoff value 80 non bacterial otus were removed the remaining bacterial sequences were assigned into otus based on vsearch abundance based greedy clustering agc method at 97 similarity the most abundance sequence of each otu was selected to represent this otu a phylogenetic tree was generated using the representative sequences of each otu based on the relaxed neighbor joining method evans et al 2006 the raw sequencing data were deposited in the european nucleotide archive ena with bioproject ids and accession numbers summarized in supplementary table a3 2 5 statistical data analysis 2 5 1 alpha diversity rarefaction curves supplementary figure a1 built from the data reached saturation for the shannon diversity index at 3000 a value close to the smallest library size of the samples it means that we have a good chance of getting very similar results using shannon with the lowest sequencing depths of 3000 reads per sample to make the sub sampling rarefying repeatable the seed was set to 123 for all analyses hence we normalized the library size by subsampling 3000 sequences per sample prior to calculating the alpha diversity to make the sub sampling rarefying repeatable the seed was set to 123 for all analyses the shannon diversity was estimated using the r package vegan oksanen et al 2007 the faith s phylogenetic diversity was calculated based on the total phylogenetic branch length of each sample using r package picante kembel et al 2010 non parametric kruskal wallis test was used to test the difference of the alpha diversity values between the compared groups dunn test was used for multiple comparisons of the alpha diversity values between groundwater wells using r package fsa ogle 2015 the p values for multiple comparisons were adjusted using the benjamini hochberg method benjamini and hochberg 1995 2 5 2 community composition and beta diversity patterns we used the normalized microbiome counts depth 3000 sequences sample to construct matrices for detecting the overall patterns of bacterial communities based on bray curtis distance silhouette analysis was performed to define the optimum number of microbial community clusters mcluster using r package nbclust charrad et al 2012 pcoa was performed using the r package phyloseq mcmurdie and holmes 2013 permanova was used to assess and validate whether the defined groups of mcluster showed significant differences in bacterial community composition with the default 999 permutations based on bray curtis distance using r package vegan oksanen et al 2007 in order to validate the use of the rarefied data for beta diversity analysis we compared the beta diversity patterns produced from the data normalized by i rarefying at 3000 sequences per sample ii total sum scaling relative abundance tss and iii cumulative sum scaling css using metagenomeseq version 1 24 1 paulson et al 2013 supplementary figure b1 and b2 the function varpart in r package vegan was used to partition the bray curtis dissimilarities of bacterial community data with respect to three explanatory tables such as hydrochemistry the significant hydrochemical parameters identified by the db rda model described above time sampling campaigns and geographic distance calculated as a principal coordinates of neighbourhood matrix pcnm of the latitude and longitude values using adjusted r squared in db rda ordination the significance of the three explanatory factors was assessed with 999 permutations 2 5 3 species rank abundance distribution rank abundance curves were used to illustrate the species distribution patterns in different communities to make the shapes and quantities of rank abundance distribution and quantities comparable between samples all rank abundance distributions were normalized to the same max rank of 373 using r package radanalysis saeedghalati et al 2017 the commonly used rank abundance distribution models wilson 1991 were fitted using r package vegan akaike information criterion aic was used to select the best model for each dataset a classical mds ordination was generated based on manhattan distance to illustrate the structural differences of the normalized rank abundance distributions between the mclusters according to saeedghalati et al 2017 2 5 4 quantification of core and rare species in this study we arbitrarily defined the core species as the bacterial otus that were present in over 80 of the groundwater samples across the transect the rare species were defined as the otus with relative abundance making up less than 0 01 of the bacterial communities in each dataset each mcluster or the whole transect since we used rarefied data for the identification of the core species we didn t perform the microbiome specific models such as edger robinson et al 2010 and deseq2 love et al 2014 and instead used the non parametric kruskal wallis analysis combined with dunn s multiple comparison tests to test the differential abundance agglomerated at the class level of the core species across the different hydrochemical conditions in the groundwater system the p values were adjusted according to benjamini and hochberg 1995 2 5 5 bacterial community assembly to explore the mechanisms that underlie the assembly of groundwater bacterial communities across space a combination of phylogenetic and abundance based null models were used according to stegen et al 2015 2013 assuming that phylogenetically related species share more similar ecological niches than phylogenetically distant species to disentangle the phylogenetic turnover β mean nearest taxa distance βmntd was calculated to quantify the phylogenetic distance between each species in one community and its closest relative in another community with the r package picante kembel et al 2010 to generate the null distribution species names and abundances were randomized across the tips of the phylogeny and βmntd was re calculated for 999 times β nearest taxon index βnti was calculated to represent the difference between observed βmntd and the mean of the null distribution in s d units βnti 2 variable selection βnti 2 homogeneous selection βnti 2 stochasticity when the environmental selection is low βnti 2 re scaled raup crick probability index rcbray chase et al 2011 based on bray curtis distance was calculated to evaluate the compositional turnover under the null hypothesis that the bacterial communities have identical species composition rcbray 0 95 homogenizing dispersal rcbray 0 95 dispersal limitation rcbray 0 95 no dominant assembly process the normalized microbiome counts depth 3000 sequences sample was used for the null model analysis here we only consider the samples taken from the hydrologically connected groundwater wells for spatial community assembly analysis across the upper h42 h43 and h53 and lower h13 h31 h41 and h51 aquifer assemblages 2 5 6 linking microbial communities to hydrochemistry principal component analysis pca was performed to elucidate the spatial patterns of the groundwater wells based on the standardized hydrochemical data z scores distance based redundancy analysis db rda was used to test the relationships between the bacterial communities and the standardized hydrochemical parameters using r package vegan the relationships between the abundance of the core classes the identified core otus merged at the class level and the measured hydrochemical parameters were determined using spearman rank correlation with p values adjusted according to benjamini and hochberg 1995 the abundance of each core class was calculated as the sum of the abundance of the core otus affiliated to this class detailed information on statistical data analysis is provided in supplementary appendix b the r scripts for the relevant analyses are available at https github com pikatech selection shapes 3 results 3 1 environmental selection shaped bacterial communities in the groundwater based on distinct hydrochemical traits groundwater samples clustered into five clusters kohlhepp et al 2017 as shown in fig 1a yet bacterial community composition showed a higher resolution since composition between h41 and the two h3 wells h31 and h32 was significantly different as illustrated in the unconstrained ordination fig 1b permanova p 0 001 the rarefied data produced similar grouping patterns of microbial communities as those normalized by tss and css methods supplementary figure b1 and b2 thus we optimized the number of microbial community clusters mcluster into six supplementary figure a2 according to the silhouette analysis with the groundwater bacterial community of h41 defined as an extra cluster mcluster 6 fig 1b large variations 45 in microbial community data were explained by the defined mclusters as a proxy of spatial effect permanova p 0 001 according to variation partitioning analysis fig 1c differences in hydrochemistry across the transect represented the largest fraction 35 0 of variation in bacterial community composition followed by spatial distance 18 6 both two explanatory matrices significantly affected the bacterial communities p 0 001 and shared 9 1 of variations in bacterial communities across the transect surprisingly the temporal variation in bacterial communities was not pronounced fig 1c and supplementary figure a3 the hydrochemical clusters previously characterized by kohlhepp et al 2017 were confirmed based on the measured hydrochemical parameters of the corresponding 3 month basis samples using a pca plot fig 2 a we used distance based redundancy analysis to investigate the potential hydrochemical drivers of the spatial difference in bacterial communities across the transect among the measured hydrochemical parameters ammonium nitrate dissolved oxygen oxidation reduction potential total inorganic carbon tic iron ii and chloride explained 30 1 of the variance adjusted of the bacterial community data across the transect fig 2b interestingly sulfur or sulfate concentration and electrical conductivity ec which separated h51 away from other wells fig 2a had no significant effect on the bacterial community composition fig 2b in summary the availability of nitrogen compounds and oxygen were the key drivers of bacterial compositional differences across the upper aquifer assemblage the significant hydrochemical parameters ammonium oxidation reduction potential and ph explained 33 6 of the variance of the bacterial community data fig 2c across the lower aquifer assemblage ammonium nitrite and tic significantly altered bacterial communities over space fig 2d however these hydrochemical parameters explained a comparatively low proportion 8 2 of the variance of the bacterial community data in the lower aquifer these explanatory variations between community compositions of the lower and upper aquifers pointed to different mechanisms underlying groundwater community assembly therefore we applied a combination of phylogenetic and abundance based null models to elucidate different impacts of deterministic and stochastic processes on the spatial community turnover between the hydrologically connected wells across the two aquifer assemblages respectively supplementary table a4 indeed the environmental variable selection was the main cause of the higher compositional turnover between the communities across the upper aquifer assemblage just the compositional turnover between the adjacent wells of h42 and h43 which had a similar phylogenetic and compositional structure was mainly attributable to random processes across the lower aquifer we observed high compositional turnover between communities owing to stochastic assembly mainly dispersal limitation the βnti and rcbray values were as similar as expected by chance indicating that the phylogenetic and compositional difference between h41 and h51 communities was mainly attributable to random processes 3 2 the proximity to the recharge area gave prominence to high bacterial diversity in the groundwater characterization of the bacterial community diversity across the transect fig 3 a showed that communities in the upper muschelkalk strata close to the surface recharge outcrop areas were most diverse with an average shannon index of 6 68 0 45 at h14 and 5 77 0 48 at h13 whereas the anoxic wells at the footslope had the lowest diversity h53 4 33 0 46 h52 4 54 0 40 the difference of bacterial alpha diversity between other wells was not significant with average shannon values ranging from 5 71 in h31 to 6 17 in h43 the phylogenetic diversity showed similar spatial patterns as the shannon index supplementary figure a4 all groundwater communities were characterized by a peak and tail pattern of their species rank abundance distributions mcgill and collins 2003 with only a few dominant species and a majority of low abundance rare species supplementary figure a5 especially in well h14 a high number of rare species was observed as indicated by the long tails of the rank abundance curves the dominance pattern was most pronounced in h52 and h53 communities where otu000001 an uncultured member of class thermodesulfovibrionia was highly dominant solely accounting for an average of 13 7 and 18 7 in relative abundance respectively in order to quantitatively compare the structure of the rank abundance distribution between samples of different sampling sequencing depths we normalized the rank abundance distribution based on the maxrank method the first two coordinates of the mds ordination which explained the majority 92 of the normalized distances of the rank abundance distributions fig 3b clearly separated the rank abundance structure into three groups i the upper hillslope group mcluster 1 ii the anoxic footslope group mcluster 5 and iii other mclusters mclusters 2 3 4 and 6 among the popular models tested e g brokenstick niche preemption lognormal zipf and zipf mandelbrot zipf provided the best fit for the normalized rank abundance curves of the bacterial otus for each mcluster with the lowest aic and deviance supplementary figure a5 the decay coefficient the slope of a fitted curve relating the log of relative abundance to the log of rank was lowest for h53 1 1 and highest for h14 0 6 a lower zipf decay coefficient suggests a sharper abundance decrease between the otus with neighboring ranks and a less even species abundance distribution pattern in the corresponding groundwater microbiome in the groundwater microbiome the majority 99 6 in numbers of otus were rare species defined as mean relative abundance below 0 01 and these rare species together represented a mean relative abundance of 25 9 across the transect supplementary table a5 specifically the relative abundance of the rare species declined following the groundwater discharge mcluster 1 25 2 vs mcluster 5 11 1 supplementary table a5 the rare species were largely affiliated to patescibacteria 7 9 in mean relative abundance proteobacteria 6 2 unclassified bacteria 3 2 omnitrophicaeota 1 6 chloroflexi 1 0 and planctomycetes 1 0 supplementary table a6 interestingly the rare species belonging to the third abundant phylum nitrospirae only accounted for 0 4 of relative abundance in the bacterial communities across the transect supplementary table a6 3 3 core groundwater species dominate groundwater in the downstream direction in the next step we identified the taxonomic composition of the dominant groundwater bacteria at the phylum level cand patescibacteria mean relative abundance 33 8 and proteobacteria 24 0 dominated in the groundwater bacterial communities fig 4 a and supplementary table a6 nitrospirae 10 0 was the third abundant phylum but its abundance varied largely in relative abundance across the transect ranging between 0 1 0 1 mean sd in h14 and 22 3 6 6 in h53 at the class level cand parcubacteria was predominant with relative abundance ranging from 11 5 3 5 in h51 to 27 8 8 6 in h32 supplementary table a7 gammaproteobacteria was the second largest class with mean relative abundance ranging from 9 5 2 3 in h32 to 16 3 9 2 in h13 followed by alphaproteobacteria ranging from 1 1 0 6 in h52 to 11 9 9 6 in h13 interestingly thermodesulfovibrionia featured an increasing relative abundance following the presumed fluid flow along the hillslope of the transect fig 4a from less than 0 01 in h1 wells to 21 2 in h53 supplementary table a7 we identified the core species because they were assumed to represent the stable fraction of the groundwater communities regardless of time and space across the transect only 26 core bacterial otus out of 29 658 otus were identified across space and time however these 26 otus were rather abundant together making up 21 6 of relative abundance in the whole community fig 4b these core otus were assigned to 14 classes in 9 phyla proteobacteria 8 otus cand patescibacteria 7 otus nitrospirae 2 otus planctomycetes 2 otu elusimicrobia 2 otus chloroflexi 2 otus actinobacteria 1 otu bacteroidetes 1 otu and gemmatimonadetes 1 otu fig 4b and supplementary table a8 the summed relative abundance of the core otus increased by 8 folds 5 7 in h13 vs 46 8 in h53 from the upper hillslope to the footslope fig 4b when we correlated the distribution patterns of the core otus at the class level to hydrochemical parameters they clustered in four groups mainly according to the availability of oxygen and nitrogen compounds ammonium and nitrate we could assign a core representative for each group the abundance of the core classes in group 1 nitrospira 1 otu assigned to the genus nitrospira jg30 kf cm66 1 otu with no close cultured relative and kd4 96 one uncultured otu was positively correlated with oxygen nitrate electrical conductivity and sulfate fig 4c therefore these core classes were enriched in the oxic lower aquifer wells of h31 h41 and h51 fig 4d nitrospira as the representative for group 1 the abundance of the core classes in group 2 was positively correlated with ammonium ph magnesium and potassium but negatively correlated with oxygen and calcium fig 4c most core classes such as thermodesulfovibrionia 1 uncultured otu gammaproteobacteria 5 otus assigned to acidiferrobacteraceae rhodoferax gouta6 sulfuritalea and tra3 20 respectively cand parcubacteria 3 otus assigned to candidatus kaiserbacteria 2 otus assigned to candidatus nomurabacteria and 1 otu assigned to uba9983 actinobacteria 1 otu assigned to candidatus planktophila and deltaproteobacteria 1 unclassified otu were clustered to group 2 and showed a marked increase of relative abundance following the water discharge fig 4d thermodesulfovibrionia as the representative for group 2 the relative abundance of the core classes in group 3 brocadiae 2 otus assigned to the family brocadiaceae and bacteroidia 1 otu assigned to the genus sediminibacterium were also positively correlated with ammonium but exhibited no correlation with oxygen these core classes were also enriched in the footslope fig 4d brocadiae as the representative for group 3 the abundance of alphaproteobacteria group 4 1 unclassified otu and 1 caulobacteriaceae otu was not correlated with the measured hydrochemical parameters and thus showed a weak abundance difference between wells fig 4d thus most core species displayed a specific preference for certain hydrochemical conditions which varied along the hillslope 4 discussion the composition of the microbial community in fractured sedimentary bedrock is a function of the aquifer s evolution since deposition of the rock of the hydro geological setting e g heterogeneous mineralogy and permeability surface inputs and hydrodynamics e g groundwater flow regime and retention time of the flow systems boyd et al 2007 galand et al 2009 graham et al 2017 bacteria together with soil borne mobile organic matter can be translocated from the surface to the groundwater upon snowmelt and extreme precipitation events zhang et al 2018 dibbern et al 2014 herrmann et al 2019 via passage through the vadose zone and then be further transferred along with groundwater flow however the subsurface establishment of these bacteria in the groundwater depends on the interactions with the local hydrogeological and biogeochemical environment especially the activity of the persistent bacteria at a certain spot will then in return shape their local environment 4 1 environmental selection is responsible for the compositional differences of microbiomes across space our combined statistical and modeling approaches showed that the local hydrogeological settings resulted in different formations of groundwater microbiomes across space microbial community structure revealed more refined spatial differentiation than hydrochemical parameters alone agreeing with the previous groundwater microbiome studies beyer et al 2015 wegner et al 2019 we identified the availability of nitrogen compounds dissolved oxygen and the distance to the surface as main drivers of microbial community composition similar to previous studies of the hainich aquifer system wegner et al 2019 opitz et al 2014 kumar et al 2017 the essential elements for microbial growth such as ca mg k and na present in enough quantities in the limestone mudstone alternations resulted in minor effects on bacterial community composition the increasing decreasing concentration of those parameters along the flow direction is caused by the longer residence and the cross strata water exchange providing hints to the role of flow regime and hydrological structure of the hillslope setting lehmann and totsche under review large variations 59 in the microbiome data could not be explained by the measured hydrochemical parameters the spatial distance or time suggesting that unmeasured hydrogeological properties surface events flow regime and accessibility of habitats due to the heterogeneous hydrogeological structures as wells as other biological interactions e g predation viruses or syntrophy have also played important roles in shaping groundwater microbiomes the null model simulation which took into account both the phylogenetic and compositional turnover has been successfully applied to characterize the dominant assembly processes in groundwater studies e g graham et al 2017 stegen et al 2013 stegen et al 2015 fillinger et al 2019 as the flow velocity is lower in the upper aquifers kohlhepp et al 2017 organisms likely gain enough time to respond and adapt to the local environment the hydrogeological parameters e g ammonium ph and oxidation reduction potential as well as unmeasured factors have likely selected for species with specific traits that facilitated them to outcompete other species in the corresponding habitats contributing to the high spatial phylogenetic turnover across the upper aquifer assemblage the difference in species abundance structures between wells can be used to indicate different assembly processes fuhrman 2009 suggested that the imposing of major stress can drive the otu abundance distribution toward a less even pattern the observed uneven abundance distribution pattern of the bacterial community in the anoxic h5 wells lends strong support to the null model result that environmental variable selection was the overriding community assembly mechanism originally arising from the study of word frequency in language zipf 1932 the zipf s law has been used for modeling the dependency of the number of species on their abundances in highly diverse communities of plants frontier 1985 and bacteria gans et al 2005 under the zipf model the entry of a species into a community is dependent on prior changes in a successional process in which later species are less abundant due to the higher cost of competition than earlier colonizers frontier 1985 in this study the lowest decay coefficient was observed for the rank abundance distribution of mcluster 5 indicating a much higher colonization cost of a new species to enter mcluster 5 than other mclusters the wells h42 and h43 were geologically adjacent wells the low phylogenetic and compositional turnover between these two wells was likely attributable to stochastic changes in population sizes across the lower oxic aquifer dispersal limitation was more important for bacterial community assembly and therefore overruled the visible effects of environmental selection this result is in line with a recent community assembly analysis of bacteria including ultra small bacteria 0 2 μm in the hainich groundwater flow system herrmann et al 2019 the impeded dispersal or exchange of microbes between wells in the lower aquifer might be attributable to the different groundwater recharge sources complex hydraulic flows and cross strata water exchange the marked difference in sulfate concentration between h51 and h41 suggests an extra source of groundwater in h51 in addition to the preferential recharge flow kohlhepp et al 2017 however sulfate was apparently not utilized as electron acceptor due to the high availability of energetically more favorable electron acceptors like oxygen nitrate and nitrite at h51 whether to normalize the data and which data normalization method to use for community data have been a long time debate in this field e g costea et al 2014 paulson et al 2014 every normalization method has its pros and cons and the choice of normalization methods depends on data characteristics weiss et al 2017 rarefying allows a less biased comparison for diversity metrics by removing sampling effects comparing uneven sampling depths but it throws away many rare taxa and may thus reduce the detection power thus we compared rarefying with the other two normalization methods e g tss and css and found that the overall beta diversity patterns did not change which supports the report by weiss et al 2017 that the choice of the normalization methods does not affect the clustering of the groups when the microbiomes differ substantially 4 2 bacteria of near surface groundwater originate from the surface habitats but their survival depends on local interactions we found the highest bacterial diversity in the wells particularly h14 of the upper hillslope near the preferential recharge area groundwater quality shows a fast response to weather events reflected by the higher availability of surface sourced substances such as dissolved oxygen lehmann and totsche under review and likely soil particles and vegetation derived organic carbon after heavy rain and snowmelt events zhang et al 2018 dibbern et al 2014 thus the input of fresh surface materials during recharge events might have stimulated the growth of the opportunistic heterotrophic bacteria in the groundwater resulting in an increase in bacterial diversity however the concentration of organic carbon compounds measured as doc and toc in the groundwater didn t show significant differences between wells over space and time this might imply that bioavailability and or composition of organic compounds rather than total concentration matters to the groundwater bacterial diversity the ubiquity of the well known surface heterotrophs proteobacteria elusimicrobia chloroflexi actinobacteria bacteroidetes and gemmatimonadetes present has been extensively reported for groundwater habitats gülay et al 2016 beyer et al 2015 flynn et al 2013 shirokova and ferris 2013 frança et al 2015 these groups particularly bacteroidetes were abundant especially in the wells particularly h14 of the upper hillslope and are suggested to play crucial roles in the decomposition of complex surface derived materials e g polysaccharides wegner et al 2019 on the other hand bacterial diversity could have been affected directly by recharge events by transporting surface borne bacteria into the groundwater this episodic input of bacteria might be the major source of the groundwater microbiome as only a small fraction 12 of pelagic groundwater genera are found in the rock matrix at the same study sites lazar et al 2019 recently studies have shown that cand patescibacteria are preferentially exported from surface soil to the groundwater upon recharge events which might be due to their ultra small cells herrmann et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 cand patescibacteria the dominant phylum detected in our groundwater system is a superphylum of the uncultivable candidate phyla radiation cpr bacteria that are estimated to constitute up to half of all the global bacterial diversity castelle et al 2018 under the low nutrient circumstances in the subsurface selective pressures on resident microorganisms may mainly be for survival and dormancy instead of resource exploitation madsen 2000 hence the high abundance of cand patescibacteria likely suggests their high dispersal ability and or adaptation strategy with low nutrient and energy requirements for survival in subsurface environments surprisingly cand patescibacteria have not been reported from the rock matrix lazar et al 2019 these findings imply that bacterial diversity in shallow aquifers was most likely introduced from the surface soil habitats besides a small fraction derived from the rock fractures via population exchange we studied the rank abundance distribution to uncover the distinctive distribution patterns i e the dominance and rarity of bacterial species across space we observed a small fraction of dominant otus in the groundwater but a marked majority 99 6 of rare species with low relative abundance in line with other microbiome studies in diverse environments sogin et al 2006 fuhrman 2009 caporaso et al 2011 pedrós alió 2012 galand et al 2009 the ecological roles these rare species play in groundwater processes are unclear but their apparently low abundance does not imply a negligible role in ecosystem functioning shade et al 2018 the rare biosphere may be in the process of dispersal between the neighboring niches in which they may become dominant fuhrman 2009 or rare species serve as genetic reservoirs and are effective opportunists in response to environmental disturbances wang et al 2017 therefore the decreasing abundance of rare species observed at our site and the increasing abundance of dominant species following the discharge reflect both the microbial dispersal and more importantly the environmental selection process we identified only 26 core otus across the transect over time revealing a large spatiotemporal variation in species composition in the groundwater microbiomes however these core otus together represented over one fifth of the whole communities plausibly reflecting their traits of a lifestyle that fit well with the living conditions in the near surface groundwater e g facultative anaerobes autotrophs adaptation to low substrate availability these core otus are likely exported specialists that survived and flourished in the groundwater because they were most competitive under the special subsurface conditions the relative abundance of the core species increased following the groundwater discharge and peaked 35 in the anoxic h5 wells uncovering the increasing importance of the core species in response to the increasing subsurface impact the findings that the abundance of nitrospirae increased markedly along with the groundwater discharge and that only a few species affiliated to this phylum were rare species highlighted the non random spatial distribution pattern of nitrospirae in the groundwater system the genus nitrospira comprises well known nitrifiers and recent studies have found that they possess the metabolic potential to perform the complete oxidation of ammonia to nitrate in oxic conditions pinto et al 2015 daims et al 2015 the abundance of the core nitrospira species was negatively correlated with ammonium but positively correlated with nitrate which might reflect their potential role as nitrite oxidizer and comammox bacteria complete ammonia oxidizer in the oxic groundwater environment nitrospirae affiliated with uncultured thermodesulfovibrionia encode complete respiratory pathways to reduce oxygen and nitrate via the processes of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium and denitrification to nitrous oxide arshad et al 2017 the dominance of the core thermodesulfovibrionia in low oxygen low nitrate and ammonium rich groundwater communities suggested their elevated potential in the nutrient particularly nitrogen turnover in the anoxic footslope wells the high abundance of planctomycetes affiliated with brocadiae in the core communities of the footslope wells was highly associated with the high availability of ammonium at those sites in line with the report that brocadiae play an important role in carbon fixation and anaerobic ammonia oxidizing anammox in the hainich groundwater systems based on multi omics analysis and functional gene analysis wegner et al 2019 kumar et al 2017 starke et al 2017 5 conclusions our data show that both subsurface environmental heterogeneity across space and surface inputs from preferential recharge areas influenced the formation and maintenance of the pelagic bacterial communities in shallow sedimentary bedrock aquifers the episodic input of surface soil derived bacteria appears to be the major source of the groundwater microbiome leading to a high bacterial diversity at wells of the upper hillslope whereas core groundwater species dominated groundwater microbiomes in the downstream direction several lines of evidence suggest that differences in flow velocity between upper and lower aquifer assemblage shaped the dominant assembly process in our groundwater system environmental selection was more prominent in the upper aquifer with a lower flow velocity allowing groundwater bacteria to respond and adapt better to the local environment resulting in a non random spatial distribution pattern of nitrospirae in the anoxic footslope wells here entry of other species into the community requires a much higher cost of competition in the groundwater system across the lower aquifer dispersal limitation appeared to be more important for bacterial community assembly and therefore overruled effects of environmental selection thus flow regime and related accessibility of habitats due to the hydrogeological structure are important

18282,treatment of nano zerovalent iron nzvi with lower valent forms of sulfur compounds sulfidation has the potential to increase the selectivity and reactivity of nzvi with target contaminants and to decrease inter particle aggregation for improving its mobility these developments help in addressing some of the long standing challenges associated with nzvi based remediation treatments and are of great interest for in situ applications herein we report results from a field scale project conducted at a contaminated site sulfidated nzvi s nzvi was prepared on site by first synthesizing carboxymethyl cellulose cmc stabilized nzvi with sodium borohydride as a reductant and then sulfidating the nzvi suspension by adding sodium dithionite transmission electron microscopy tem coupled with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds of cmc s nzvi from synthesis barrels confirms the presence of both discrete spherical nzvi like particles 90 nm as well as larger irregular structures 500 nm comprising of iron sulfides this cmc s nzvi suspension was gravity fed into a sandy material and monitored through multiple multi level monitoring wells samples collected from upstream and downstream wells suggest very good radial and vertical iron distribution tem eds analysis from the recovered well samples also indicates the presence of both nzvi like particles as well as the larger flake like structures similar to those found in the injected cmc s nzvi suspension this study shows that s nzvi stabilized with cmc can be safely synthesized on site and is highly mobile and stable in the subsurface demonstrating for the first time the field applicability of s nzvi graphical abstract image 1 keywords nano zerovalent iron sulfidation dithionite subsurface transport field application characterization 1 introduction nano zerovalent iron nzvi is the most commonly applied nanomaterial for water and soil remediation and has been tested for several field scale applications across the world o carroll et al 2013 phenrat et al 2019 stefaniuk et al 2016 successful remediation projects using nzvi based technologies rely on the delivery of the nanoparticles to the targeted area and the establishment of a treatment zone despite advances in the design of nzvi key technical challenges remain limiting its more widespread acceptance as a viable and competitive remediation technology fan et al 2016a fan et al 2016b these challenges mainly include poor selectivity and low subsurface mobility though the development of stabilizers he and zhao 2005 he et al 2007 phenrat et al 2010 schrick et al 2004 sun et al 2007 tiraferri et al 2008 has led to its increased mobility kocur et al 2013 limited research has been conducted to improve the selectivity of nzvi and to decrease its reaction with natural reductant demand processes in the subsurface most notably these include hydrogen evolution reactions with water eq 1 1 f e 0 2 h 2 o f e 2 2 o h h 2 decrease in hydrogen evolution has been observed after treating nzvi with lower valent forms of sulfur compounds i e sulfidation indicating that its reaction with water is inhibited to some extent fan et al 2016a fan et al 2016b nunez garcia et al 2016 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 this has led to improvements in the longevity nunez garcia et al 2016 and selectivity fan et al 2016a of nzvi particles for example during a sulfidated nzvi s nzvi treatability study 63 of the iron was still in the zerovalent state after 400 days nunez garcia et al 2016 sulfidation of nzvi has increased the removal efficiency of target pollutants such as trichloroethene tce han and yan 2016 kim et al 2013 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 1 2 dichloroethane nunez garcia et al 2016 tetrabromobisphenol li et al 2016 4 nitrophenol tang et al 2016 diclofenac song et al 2017 and metal ions cumbal et al 2015 fan et al 2013 su et al 2015 sulfidation methods can be classified as aqueous aqueous and aqueous solid depending on when the sulfur compound is introduced to the synthesis solution fan et al 2017 han and yan 2016 these methods have been reported to yield particles with varying physico chemical and structural properties but similar reactivity in dechlorinating tce han and yan 2016 it has also been reported that sulfidation decreases magnetic attractions between the particles which results in decreased aggregation and sedimentation song et al 2017 su et al 2015 among the various sulfidation precursors tested so far sodium dithionite na2s2o4 has been widely used in other field scale remediation applications such as in situ redox manipulation isrm amonette et al 1994 despite the increasing number of laboratory based s nzvi studies no study has yet investigated field scale s nzvi transport a number of studies have reported success related to the injectability and mobility of traditional polymer coated nzvi at the field scale bennett et al 2010 he et al 2010 johnson et al 2013 kocur et al 2014 however there is a need to assess the field applicability of emerging reactive formulations such as s nzvi this study presents a field scale demonstration showing the subsurface mobility of carboxymethyl cellulose cmc stabilized and na2s2o4 doped s nzvi suspension the specific objectives of this study were to 1 scale up and develop an on site field scale cmc s nzvi synthesis method 2 investigate changes to in situ geochemistry following cmc s nzvi injection 3 quantify in situ cmc s nzvi transport and 4 characterize field synthesized cmc s nzvi suspension before injection and in the multi level monitoring wells after injection this study builds upon our previous understanding of nzvi field studies chowdhury et al 2015 he et al 2010 kocur et al 2014 by investigating the horizontal as well as vertical distribution of the injected cmc s nzvi suspension 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description field work was conducted in sarnia ontario at a site adjacent to a demolished chlorinated solvents production facility during operation the study area was home to various utilities and sewers some of which might have been the cause of underground spillage groundwater at the site is contaminated with a mixture of chlorinated solvents including tetrachloroethene pce trichloroethene tce carbon tetrachloride ct and chloroform cf the presence of dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl was also visually confirmed between 4 and 5 m below ground surface bgs after operation the infrastructure was covered with a porous sandy material stretching east to west fig 1 and capped with an engineered clay layer hence borehole logs advanced with an ams powerprobe drill rig revealed three major sections composed of a clayey fill at the top non native sandy material in the middle and the native clay at the bottom of the geologic system these sections are not continuous containing in some instances traces of gravel brick and wood fragments the underlaying natural geologic unit is composed of brown weathered clay until 6 7 m bgs followed by a nearly impervious unweathered clay with hydraulic conductivities of 2 1 10 9 and 1 6 10 10 m s 1 kocur et al 2014 the water table was measured to be 1 5 m bgs throughout the study area 2 2 background conditions a reducing environment was already prevalent within the targeted depth of 4 12 4 42 m bgs oxidation reduction potential orp values ranged between 5 mv and 72 3 mv and ph was near neutral 7 0 0 56 daughter products from pce and ct dechlorination i e dichloroethenes dces and dichloromethane dcm were present in background samples suggesting the occurrence of natural attenuation or the influence of previous cmc nzvi injection performed at nearby wells in november 2010 kocur et al 2014 background conditions might have been impacted by this injection however due to the locations and layout of the current monitoring wells the past field trial is not considered to have affected the current cmc s nzvi injection conducted in november 2014 summarized data for the background geo chemical conditions are shown in table s1 total iron and boron concentrations ranged from 0 06 to 0 17 and 0 25 to 0 36 mmol l 1 respectively in the background samples injected iron and boron concentrations were greater than 100 times of the background concentrations therefore a background correction was not applied to the total iron and boron concentrations 2 3 installation of monitoring wells eight multi level monitoring wells mws and one injection well niw were installed each multi level mw consisted of seven color coded intervals 0 305 m apart with each having a screen length of 0 127 m fig 1 the screens were installed within a range of 2 9 4 9 m bgs during drilling well logs were obtained for transects corresponding to the wells na3 niw na1 and nb2 na4 could not be logged but this well is known to be sandy backfill due to its proximity to a sump that was emplaced in 2010 fig 1 shows a plan and a cross sectional view of well locations including a legend denoting the color codes for multiple well levels six intervals from black to white were monitored for nb1 and nb2 however groundwater monitoring targeted only depths between 4 12 and 4 42 m bgs which correspond to the blue and white intervals for most of the other wells fig 1 locations of greater depths were not sampled e g the red interval not shown in fig 1 located at 4 73 m bgs due to their close proximity to the source zone this configuration was selected to maximize capturing of horizontal as well as vertical extent of cmc s nzvi breakthrough downgradient of the injection well 2 4 cmc s nzvi synthesis and injection 620 l of s nzvi stabilized with 0 77 weight volume cmc were synthesized on site in four distinct batches 155 l each the mass and volume of each reagent used for the synthesis is reported in table s2 all reagents were dissolved in deoxygenated deionized water nzvi suspension was prepared by reducing ferrous sulfate a k petrochem ind ltd vaughn on with sodium borohydride gfs chemicals inc columbus oh in a process modified and optimized for field applications bennett et al 2010 he et al 2010 johnson et al 2013 kocur et al 2014 anoxic conditions were maintained by continuously purging the solutions and the headspace with high purity nitrogen gas praxair canada inc sarnia on the freshly synthesized nzvi suspension was then treated with na2s2o4 alfa aesar ward hill ma to yield final dithionite and nzvi concentrations of 22 mm and 18 mm 1 g l 1 respectively the fe0 content of the field synthesized batches was measured using acid digestion with hydrochloric acid 1 ml 32 hcl as reported previously nunez garcia et al 2016 before sulfidation the fe0 content was 85 0 of the theoretical total iron concentration after sulfidation acid digestion of cmc s nzvi formed a cloudy suspension and no h2 formation was observed fig s1 excess dithionite and its decomposition products e g thiosulfate remain in the cmc s nzvi suspension and cannot be decanted out during acid digestion thiosulfate consumes acid to form a cloudy white suspension of colloidal sulfur eq 2 johnston and mcamish 1973 2 h s 2 o 3 2 s s h s o 3 therefore quantification of the fe0 content was not possible for the cmc s nzvi solution aqueous solid sulfidation with dithionite likely due to the presence of thiosulfate or other dithionite decomposition products large scale on site synthesis of s nzvi with dithionite can present unique health and safety h s challenges and considerations though dithionite decomposition products can generate hydrogen sulfide h2s de carvalho and schwedt 2001 it has never been reported during the isrm applications in the field however during a preliminary cmc s nzvi synthesis trial for the current study h2s 6 7 ppm was detected near the vicinity of the synthesis barrel after adding dithionite although not near the breathing zone generation and off gassing of h2s might have come from the reaction of dithionite decomposition products with the excess hydrogen gas h2 formed from the borohydride hydrolysis during the nzvi synthesis borohydride is typically added in stoichiometric excess four times the amount needed for rapid and uniform growth of nzvi particles zhang and elliott 2006 to ensure sufficient time for the nucleation of nzvi particles and to allow the dissipation of h2 gas to minimize the h2s formation during the on site synthesis the nzvi suspension was continuously mixed for about an hour before adding dithionite the final cmc s nzvi suspension was mixed for at least 1 h before injecting into the subsurface because of the potential of h2s generation in large quantities during the aqueous aqueous sulfidation process as a result of direct reaction with borohydride the aqueous solid method is recommended as the preferred sulfidation approach for the on site synthesis of cmc s nzvi when using dithionite cmc s nzvi suspension was then injected by gravity over 16 h maintaining a constant head in the injection well injection rates ranged between 0 85 and 1 l min 1 during injection the hydraulic gradient was controlled for 32 h by using two recirculation wells 3 91 m downstream and 15 8 m upstream of injection well fig 1 to increase the advective flux throughout the study area the induced gradient between the recirculation wells was 0 088 compared to a natural gradient of 0 009 2 5 sample collection and analytical methodology to allow for the simultaneous sampling of all selected wells and intervals a multiple port set up was constructed quality assurance quality control field protocols were followed including notes recording observations in the field using dedicated and decontaminated sampling equipment and minimizing the aeration during sample collection all samples were collected in pre cleaned laboratory supplied bottles with suitable preservatives all bottles were clearly labeled with a designated sample identifier number analytical parameters and date and time of sampling the samples were immediately stored in insulated coolers with ice packs to maintain low temperature and shipped to the laboratory as soon as possible not exceeding the recommended maximum holding times geochemical parameters including orp and ph were measured on site using a water quality analyzer ysi 556 mps yellow spring oh samples for total iron sulfur and boron were digested and diluted with hydrochloric acid or nitric acid and then analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy varian vista pro axial santa clara ca analysis for sulfate was performed using a high performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a conductivity detector model 432 waters milford ma a 4 6 50 cm ic pak anion column wat007355 and 12 acetonitrile in water eluent colloidal stability of cmc nzvi suspension was determined for the samples collected before and after addition of dithionite using a uv vis spectrophotometer helios alpha thermo fischer waltham ma measurements were taken at 508 nm for 88 h at 10 min intervals it should be noted that all the samples were vacuum sealed immediately after collection to minimize oxidation during transportation to the laboratory and storage before analysis 6 24 h the uv vis absorption spectra were also obtained for cmc nzvi and cmc s nzvi suspensions from synthesis batches and for selected mw samples in the wavelength range of 200 900 nm zeta ζ potential and effective hydrodynamic diameter quantified by dynamic light scattering dls for the samples

spectroscopy eds using the inca detector oxford instruments abingdon uk attached to the fei titan tem 3 results and discussion 3 1 horizontal mobility the cmc s nzvi suspension was quite mobile with significant transport to na4 blue and na3 white 2 7 m downgradient and 1 71 m upgradient from the injection well respectively at the first sampling time of 4 75 h fig s2 with time increased iron concentrations were also found in two other downgradient monitoring wells at a distance of 0 86 m nb1 white and 0 91 m nc1 white from the injection well the highest iron concentration was detected in nb1 white at 18 h after the start of injection reaching 1 31 mmol l 1 8 8 of the injected 14 9 mmol l 1 fig 2 a fig s2 in these four wells sulfate sulfur and boron concentrations often followed a similar trend as iron fig 2c figs s3a b notable upgradient migration of the cmc s nzvi suspension to na3 white might have occurred due to a localized gradient caused by the injection well higher iron concentrations at nb1 white na4 blue na3 white and nc1 white are also clearly illustrated in fig 3 where all the sampled wells were compared for their fe to b molar ratios fe b against the fe b ratio 0 39 of injected cmc s nzvi suspension both boron and iron would undergo dispersion diffusion and dilution but only iron particles are presumed to be removed from the aqueous phase due to filtration boron is stable in aqueous environments and can be found as boric acid h3bo3 and borate anion bo3 3 leenhouts et al 1998 uncharged h3bo3 is the dominant species found in most of the natural water systems and its surface adsorption is deemed unlikely due to the direct competition with water for available surface sites quast et al 2006 it has been shown that boron is conserved during groundwater transport and can be considered as a conservative tracer under many conditions leenhouts et al 1998 quast et al 2006 however borate ions are found to precipitate on the outer layer of the nzvi during its synthesis with borohydride nurmi et al 2005 it is possible that some boron might have retained in this manner and the boron concentrations reported herein are an underestimation for this reason boron is rather operationally defined as a conservative tracer in this study therefore deviation from the calculated fe b ratio represented by a straight line in fig 3 corresponds to the extent of retention of iron particles during transport to each well fig 3 shows that approximately 50 of the iron particles were retained during subsurface transport delivery of iron nanoparticles to greater distances have been previously reported for various nzvi formulations for example busch et al 2015 injected 1 2 kg of carbon iron colloids cic an activated carbon supported treatment containing 15 fe0 by weight and suspended in cmc through visual observations and gravimetric analysis it was estimated that 12 5 of the mass injected was delivered to the extraction well located at a distance of 5 3 m with a peak total iron concentration of 0 013 mmol l 1 0 74 mg l 1 however mobility results from the current study can be considered an improvement when compared to previous traditional cmc nzvi gravity fed injections in sandy media for example cmc nzvi was detected only 1 m downstream of another injection well in a previous trial at the current site kocur et al 2014 another study conducted in an engineered aquifer reported only 4 of the total injected iron at a well 1 m downstream johnson et al 2013 he et al 2010 observed a normalized peak total iron concentration of 15 and 3 in monitoring wells located 1 5 and 3 m downstream of the injection well respectively in other studies indirect measurements have been employed to confirm the breakthrough of iron using total solids ts and suspended solids ss as an indicator for nzvi wei et al 2010 reported travel distances to 3 m with minor changes at the furthest monitoring distance of 5 m one reason for improved mobility of cmc s nzvi could be the reduced inter particle magnetic attractions that would otherwise lead to sedimentation discussed in section 3 4 5 normalizing iron breakthrough to boron obtained by calculating the area under the c c0 1 vs time curve enables quantification of the extent of cmc s nzvi particle retention 53 4 and 55 9 particle breakthrough was observed at na4 blue and na3 white respectively the wells further upstream and downstream fig s4 good particle mobility was also observed at the other monitoring locations for example normalized breakthrough of 46 9 and 30 1 was quantified at nb1 white and nc1 white respectively using a similar normalization approach he et al 2010 reported 37 4 iron breakthrough in a well 1 5 m away from the injection point kocur et al 2014 reported a peak breakthrough of 75 when normalized to a tracer before decreasing to 50 for most of the injection period in a well 1 m downstream of the injection well this analysis should be used cautiously when both iron and boron are present in low concentrations for example nb2 white would seem to yield the highest transport with 73 6 breakthrough based on the normalized fe b areas fig s4 even though concentrations of iron did not exceed 1 4 0 2 mmol l 1 of the injected solution fig s2 data for na2 blue na1 white and nb3 white are not discussed here due to their low iron and boron concentrations cmc s nzvi transport was also quantified at 3 and 17 days after injection temporal changes in iron concentration were sometimes non monotonic following the cessation of injection iron concentrations decreased for na3 white na4 blue and nc1 white on day 3 fig 2b similarly the iron concentrations also decreased for nb2 green nb2 blue and all the intervals of nb1 table s3 however on day 17 concentrations remained relatively constant for na3 white nc1 white and nb2 blue increased for na4 blue nb2 green and nb2 clear and decreased for all the intervals of nb1 from black to white fig 2b and table s3 increase in concentration from day 3 to day 17 at na4 blue may be attributed to the preferential transport of iron from the injection well which still had retained high concentration of cmc s nzvi suspension under a natural gradient it is also noted that during injection cmc s nzvi reached na4 blue before the other wells fig 2 fig s2 given that na4 blue is the farthest monitoring well fig 1a it is suspected that site heterogeneities including preferential flow paths allowed the cmc s nzvi suspension to initially bypass nc1 white and nb2 white 2d laboratory studies phenrat et al 2010 as well as field injections bennett et al 2010 kocur et al 2014 have reported that polymer modified nzvi suspensions preferentially travel through the more conductive hydraulic pathways the sharp decrease on day 17 at nb1 all intervals which is closest to the injection well is likely affected by similar processes cessation of the cmc s nzvi source as well as by cmc s nzvi particle deposition on the porous media kocur et al 2014 it is important to note that the relatively high iron concentrations on day 3 represent a significant improvement in the stability of the particles when compared to previous field trials for example kocur et al 2014 reported a decrease in the normalized iron concentration from 50 during injection to 7 8 at 16 h after the injection 3 2 vertical migration and visual observations concentrations of both iron and boron increased with depth in the nb1 well with the highest recorded in the direct pathway of the injected suspension i e 4 4 4 5 m bgs fig 4 a b the color of the nb1 white groundwater sample was found to be dark black image not shown further supporting the highest concentrations of iron at this location the presence of cmc s nzvi suspension was also clearly visible in the upper levels of nb1 fig s5b indicating that particles travelled vertically 1 7 m up to the black interval which is 2 9 m bgs for nb2 located 1 78 m from the injection well the highest concentrations were measured at the blue interval i e 4 1 4 2 m bgs at 21 25 h also visually indicated by the dark black color of the nb2 blue groundwater sample fig 4c d fig s5b the metal concentrations were lower in the clear interval just above the blue interval as compared to the nb2 green with no significant change in the iron concentrations at the yellow and black intervals fig 4c d a similar trend was observed visually where nb2 green has a darker black color than nb2 clear fig s5b this could be due to the subsurface heterogeneity and preferential flow paths in contrast significant increase in boron concentrations was quantified at the yellow and black intervals of the nb2 well the presence of boron at the upper most intervals suggests that iron particles were retained during vertical transport of the injected solution to these sampling points though iron concentrations were not measured for all the levels for na4 the dark black color of groundwater samples indicates that the cmc s nzvi suspension had travelled vertically upwards even to the uppermost level of this well fig s5b similarly the upward migration of cmc s nzvi has been visually noticed for nc1 and na3 up to green and clear intervals respectively other studies have also reported vertical migration of zvi nzvi quinn et al 2005 velimirovic et al 2014 particles also remained in suspension at the blue and clear levels of nb1 at day 3 and day 17 fig s5c the presence of injected suspension is also clearly visible in na4 blue nc1 white nb1 white nb3 white and nb3 blue on day 17 fig s5d in fact suspended particles remained in the injection well for months following the injection period as observed from a sample collected at 196 days fig s5e having 13 8 of the injected iron 3 3 changes in groundwater ph and orp ph did not change significantly at any of the monitoring wells and remained near neutral 7 0 1 0 throughout the injection period fig s6 though ph is expected to increase due to the corrosion of iron by water other nzvi field studies have also reported less than anticipated increases kocur et al 2014 wei et al 2010 this suggests that dilution of the injected suspension and the buffering capacity of the subsurface media would moderate the effect of cmc s nzvi on the groundwater ph another reason could also be the limited corrosion of s nzvi by water he et al 2018 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 as the negatively charged s atoms on the nzvi surface would weaken its interaction with the h2o molecules by repelling the o atoms of h2o molecules gu et al 2019 orp was measured for discrete samples using a conventional platinum pt electrode during cmc s nzvi injection a sharp drop in orp was observed for na4 blue na3 white and nb2 white at t 4 h fig s7 which aligned with the arrival of cmc s nzvi suspension at these locations fig s2 there was also a gradual decrease in the orp for nb1 white and nc1 white the lowest orp 175 mv was recorded for na4 blue 6 h after injection this was followed by na3 white at 155 mv due to time constraints in the field it was not possible to allow for enough equilibration time for all the orp measurements therefore for some cases including nb1 white measurements were recorded within 5 10 min and actual orp values might be much lower than reported here decrease in orp was concurrent with the iron and sulfate breakthrough as shown in fig s8 for nb1 white these results indicate a significant influence of the cmc s nzvi injection on the aquifer geochemistry however the decrease in the orp was not as noticeable as reported in previous nzvi field studies johnson et al 2013 kocur et al 2014 wei et al 2010 changes in orp are a function of the redox couples contributing to the measured mixed potentials emix in the system for nzvi suspensions the major redox couples are h2 h and dissolved fe2 fe3 species shi et al 2015 past research has reported lower h2 evolution for s nzvi during its corrosion by water fan et al 2016a rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 thus the relatively mild decrease in orp in the current study might be due to the lower generation of h2 in the cmc s nzvi treatment as compared to the pristine nzvi the fe2 speciation and concentrations would also be different for the cmc s nzvi treatment compared to pristine nzvi nunez garcia et al 2016 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 moreover nzvi adsorption on the electrode and the type of electrode used also play a significant role in the orp measurements johnson et al 2013 3 4 characterization 3 4 1 tem eds detailed particle characterization can be used to help elucidate operative transport processes as well as to evaluate changes in nzvi particles due to sulfidation and subsurface transport tem eds analysis of the cmc nzvi before sulfidation suspension from synthesis batches shows that particles were primarily small discrete spheres and mainly composed of iron fig s9 however larger irregular structures representing iron oxy hydr oxides were also present though the synthesis vessels were constantly purged with nitrogen some level of oxidation is to be expected during the field synthesis the saed pattern for cmc nzvi consists of diffused rings indicating its amorphous structure tem micrographs of cmc s nzvi from the synthesis batches suggest that particles with two different morphologies were present following the sulfidation process figs s10 s11 most of the particles were small discrete spheres that resembled the nzvi particles from the unsulfidated nzvi suspension fig s9a these particles with an average size of 90 13 nm n 82 were also found to be similar in size to those previously reported for field synthesized nzvi kocur et al 2014 han and yan 2016 also reported that the appearance of spherical particles in s nzvi formed during treatment of nzvi with thiosulfate was akin to that of the unmodified nzvi the presence of oxygen observed in the eds scans of the smaller particles indicates that peripheral oxidation by water might have resulted in the formation of an iron oxide coating figs s10 s11 there was low or in some cases no sulfur s present in these nzvi like particles indicating either the presence of a small amount of iron sulfides fesx or their complete absence this suggests that a major portion of cmc s nzvi suspension was still comprised of nzvi like particles which would mainly be fe0 nunez garcia et al 2016 found most of the iron to be still preserved in the zerovalent state after nzvi sulfidation han and yan 2016 also detected the presence of fe0 in their s nzvi particles after thiosulfate treatment the saed pattern fig s11 for nzvi like particle in the cmc s nzvi shows that the rings are sharper and more distinct than that for the original cmc nzvi fig s9 some spots were also present in the cmc s nzvi sample this suggests that the amorphous nzvi particles have started turning crystalline the second type of particles were larger flake like structures figs s10 s11 composed mainly of iron and sulfur with an average particle size of 505 2 81 4 nm n 11 these were comparatively fewer in number fig s10b and were not observed in the unsulfidated cmc nzvi suspension fig s9 the morphology of these particles suggests that fesx distribution on some of the nzvi particles did not occur uniformly to form the typical core shell structure fan et al 2013 rather these particles were either overgrown into fesx flakes or the fe0 core was abundantly covered by the flaky fesx shell fan et al 2013 su et al 2015 2018 there is also a possibility that the few iron oxy hydr oxide particles present in the unsulfidated cmc nzvi suspension would have transformed to the larger fesx structures after dithionite addition particles recovered from nb1 white and nb1 clear 0 86 m from niw were similar in morphology to those found in the injected cmc s nzvi suspension fig 5 a c possessing both spherical and flake like structures in a previous nzvi trial in the adjoining area kocur et al 2014 also did not notice any significant morphological changes between the injected particles and those recovered from the monitoring well fig 5 shows that the nzvi like particles present as small discrete spheres 100 nm size had either low or no sulfur content as depicted in the eds spectra fig 5b c e1 e2 and e4 the eds spectra of larger flake like particles showing significant s peaks along with fe indicate the presence of fesx phase fig 5b c e3 and e5 fig s12 e1 e3 these distinct fesx particles were also easily found in the nb1 blue nb2 green and nb2 clear the latter two 1 78 m from niw figs s12 s13 however the small nzvi like particles were not easily detectable in these monitoring well samples the lower iron concentrations in these samples might have made it difficult to locate these particles during tem analysis these particles could also have oxidized sulfidized or retained as nzvi but aggregated into larger clusters for example a tem image of nb1 blue shows the presence of small spherical nzvi like particles that are clustered together and covered by a thick sheet of possibly fesx fig s12a1 tem eds data indicates that particles in the monitoring well samples collected at 18 and 72 h after injection are similar to those collected from the original cmc s nzvi synthesis batches saed pattern for the nb1 clear fig s12b inset shows well defined spots and visible rings indicating the polycrystalline nature of the particles it was interesting to see that the samples collected from niw at 196 days after the injection were still black in color indicating the stability of the injected suspension fig s5e over time exposure to oxygenated water from upstream would result in the oxidation of iron sulfides however the orp data shows that reduced conditions were still prevalent at this site fig s7 the presence of fe3 cl and so4 2 would also favor sulfide oxidation bibi et al 2011 in fig s14 tem images show the presence of nano spheres plate like particles and larger flake like structures presumably representing iron oxides oxy hydroxides and sulfides an et al 2017 reported the formation of lepidocrocite γ feooh and magnetite fe3o4 from oxidative dissolution of amorphous fes formation of akaganéite feo oh cl was observed during the oxidation of iron sulfides from chloride rich sulfidic sediments bibi et al 2011 the presence of cl peaks in the eds spectra of niw suggests the formation of feo oh cl and sulfur peaks indicate the presence of sulfides fig 5 e6 e7 during oxidation feo oh cl might have coated the surface of fesx to form fesx feo oh cl thus suppressing further oxidation of fesx jeong et al 2010 moreover the black color of the suspension also suggests the presence of iron sulfides or feii oxides feo fe3o4 feiii oxy hydr oxides if present might be a minor species 3 4 2 uv vis spectra fig s15a shows the absorbance spectra for cmc nzvi cmc s nzvi and nb1 white spectra for samples from other monitoring wells collected during active injection did not deviate from nb1 white fig s15b therefore nb1 white was chosen as a representative sample for comparison with cmc nzvi and cmc s nzvi the absorbance of cmc nzvi gave small peaks between 300 and 372 nm followed by a uniform decline up to 900 nm in contrast the cmc s nzvi spectrum sharply declined between 290 and 310 nm and then gradually decayed from 310 to 900 nm the spectrum obtained from nb1 white resembles that of cmc s nzvi though at a lower absorbance which would be due to its lower concentration it is also interesting to note that the nb2 blue spectrum showed significantly higher absorbance and resembles cmc s nzvi quite well nb2 blue was one of the samples with the darkest black color fig s5b and its iron concentration increased from 210 μm to 637 μm at the end of the injection table s3 to further compare these particles to the injected cmc s nzvi another groundwater sample from nb1 white was intentionally oxidized in the laboratory labeled nb1 whiteox by exposing it to air the nb1 whiteox spectrum differs from the cmc s nzvi and unoxidized nb1 white showing a more gradual decrease up to 550 nm and very little absorbance afterwards this data supports results from the tem micrographs suggesting that the recovered samples from monitoring wells were similar to the injected cmc s nzvi suspension experiencing minimal oxidation during the subsurface transport 3 4 3 particle size distribution psd tem provides information about the inner electron dense metal core and excludes the outer cmc layer thus dls was used to quantify the hydrodynamic diameter which includes both the metal particle as well as its outer cmc layer yielding the overall size of the particle the hydrodynamic diameter of unsulfidated cmc nzvi was 355 8 1 8 nm with a monomodal particle size distribution psd fig s16a however the psd changed to bimodal after addition of dithionite indicating the presence of two types of particles fig s16b these results are in alignment with the findings from the tem analysis for the multimodal psd the calculated hydrodynamic diameter does not give accurate particle size information thus the dls data for the samples with bimodal distributions is discussed in terms of size range rather than the median or mean diameter the size of smaller particles for cmc s nzvi ranged from 357 4 to 438 7 nm which is close to the hydrodynamic diameter of unsulfidated cmc nzvi particles the size of larger particles ranged from 881 to 1038 nm similarly the mw samples also showed a bimodal distribution supporting the presence of smaller nzvi like particles along with the larger fesx structures as shown in tem analysis figs s16c f some differences in the dls sizes of smaller particles for mw samples from the cmc s nzvi could be due to the variability associated with the field sampling however the size of larger particles for mw samples was significantly greater than that of cmc s nzvi particles this could be due to the formation of some larger clusters as seen in the tem micrographs for mw samples 3 4 4 zeta ζ potential zeta ζ potential 51 8 1 0 mv fig s17 for the unsulfidated cmc nzvi in the synthesis batches was consistent with those in the literature chowdhury et al 2012 kocur et al 2013 a less negative ζ potential 44 9 2 4 mv was observed after adding dithionite interestingly this was in contrast with the findings of previous studies where ζ potential was reported to be more negative after sulfidation and it was attributed to the presence of fesx on the surface of s nzvi particles kim et al 2013 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 tang et al 2016 however these studies used bare s nzvi particles that were washed multiple times with deoxygenated water and thus the supernatant from the synthesis was not retained in contrast s nzvi particles used in the current study were stabilized with cmc before sulfidation and the supernatant from the synthesis containing excess dithionite and its decomposition products e g thiosulfate sulfate was retained in the suspension moreover the na ions from the nabh4 na2s2o4 and na cmc were also present in the suspension even though the cmc s nzvi particles in the current study had fesx on the surface the presence of these anions and cations would significantly increase the ionic strength of the cmc s nzvi suspension resulting in less negative ζ potential saleh et al 2008 suponik et al 2016 the average ζ potential for multiple monitoring well samples collected during injection was 20 4 1 3 mv fig s17 which is less than half of the measured ζ potential for the injected cmc s nzvi suspension this differs from the study of kocur et al 2014 where the particles recovered from monitoring wells had similar ζ potential 48 3 2 3 mv to that of the synthesis batches 49 2 1 5 mv the further less negative ζ potential for monitoring well samples in the current study could be due to dilution tantra et al 2010 3 4 5 colloidal stability particle stability is a prerequisite for optimal nzvi delivery to the contaminated source zones as the settling of nzvi particles in the synthesis vessel before injection would limit the mass delivered to the subsurface kocur et al 2013 in the current study 50 5 of the unsulfidated cmc nzvi synthesized on site aggregated and settled after 72 h fig s18 this is consistent with the sedimentation curves from a similar study where only 50 of the cmc nzvi remained in the suspension at 24 32 h after on site synthesis kocur et al 2014 in contrast only 7 7 sedimentation was observed for the on site synthesized dithionite treated cmc nzvi i e cmc s nzvi after 72 h fig s18 this data suggests that the injected cmc s nzvi particles would stay suspended for much longer periods in the groundwater increasing their mobility and delivery to the contaminated areas recent studies have suggested that sulfidation of nzvi can effectively inhibit its aggregation and sedimentation gong et al 2017 song et al 2017 su et al 2015 2016 the rate of aggregation depends on a range of factors including particle concentration fe0 content particle size distribution and the thickness of adsorbed polymer in the case of stabilized nzvi phenrat et al 2010 within the core shell structure of nzvi the content of fe0 dictates the magnitude of inter particle magnetic attractions decreasing the fe0 content oxidation to less magnetic particles decreases nzvi aggregation and favors its transport resulting in enhanced mobility phenrat et al 2010 the greater stability of s nzvi has been attributed to the lower magnetic attractions between iron sulfides fesx su et al 2015 2016 for example gong et al 2017 reported a decrease in the saturation magnetization from 165 6 emu g for nzvi to 78 0 emu g for s nzvi though fe0 content of cmc s nzvi in the current study could not be measured details in section 2 4 our past research nunez garcia et al 2016 has shown a decrease in fe0 content and formation of iron sulfides after sulfidating the bare nzvi with dithionite thus the decreased aggregation and sedimentation of cmc s nzvi in this study can be attributed to the decrease in fe0 content and the formation of iron sulfides resulting in lower inter particle magnetic attractions 4 conclusions cmc stabilized s nzvi was successfully synthesized on site by the borohydride reduction method and aqueous solid sulfidation with sodium dithionite for field scale synthesis of relatively large quantities of s nzvi it is suggested to perform an aqueous solid sulfidation over an aqueous aqueous approach in order to reduce the possible generation of h2s to minimize health and safety concerns associated with side reactions between chemical precursors it is recommended to work near the stoichiometry amount necessary for borohydride and to optimize the concentration of dithionite by s fe ratio for the intended application in the present study the suspension was mixed for 1 2 h to allow time for the dissipation of any h2s generated tem images of cmc s nzvi synthesis batches revealed the presence of both discrete spherical nzvi particles as well as larger flake like structures associated with iron sulfides cmc s nzvi was found to possess better colloidal stability than cmc nzvi which could possibly contribute to its better transport in the subsurface approximately 620 l of cmc s nzvi was fed under gravity into a sandy aquifer by an injection well cmc s nzvi suspension was mobile in the subsurface achieving good horizontal and vertical distribution throughout the study area with detection in multiple monitoring wells both downstream and upstream of the injection well travel distances ranged from 0 9 m to at least 2 7 m which was the location of the farthest monitoring well tem eds analysis confirmed the presence of both nzvi like as well as fesx flaky structures in the mw samples similar to those identified in the cmc s nzvi synthesis batches this is further supported by the dls analysis which showed a bimodal particle size distribution for the mw samples similar to cmc s nzvi results reported herein demonstrate cmc s

18282,treatment of nano zerovalent iron nzvi with lower valent forms of sulfur compounds sulfidation has the potential to increase the selectivity and reactivity of nzvi with target contaminants and to decrease inter particle aggregation for improving its mobility these developments help in addressing some of the long standing challenges associated with nzvi based remediation treatments and are of great interest for in situ applications herein we report results from a field scale project conducted at a contaminated site sulfidated nzvi s nzvi was prepared on site by first synthesizing carboxymethyl cellulose cmc stabilized nzvi with sodium borohydride as a reductant and then sulfidating the nzvi suspension by adding sodium dithionite transmission electron microscopy tem coupled with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds of cmc s nzvi from synthesis barrels confirms the presence of both discrete spherical nzvi like particles 90 nm as well as larger irregular structures 500 nm comprising of iron sulfides this cmc s nzvi suspension was gravity fed into a sandy material and monitored through multiple multi level monitoring wells samples collected from upstream and downstream wells suggest very good radial and vertical iron distribution tem eds analysis from the recovered well samples also indicates the presence of both nzvi like particles as well as the larger flake like structures similar to those found in the injected cmc s nzvi suspension this study shows that s nzvi stabilized with cmc can be safely synthesized on site and is highly mobile and stable in the subsurface demonstrating for the first time the field applicability of s nzvi graphical abstract image 1 keywords nano zerovalent iron sulfidation dithionite subsurface transport field application characterization 1 introduction nano zerovalent iron nzvi is the most commonly applied nanomaterial for water and soil remediation and has been tested for several field scale applications across the world o carroll et al 2013 phenrat et al 2019 stefaniuk et al 2016 successful remediation projects using nzvi based technologies rely on the delivery of the nanoparticles to the targeted area and the establishment of a treatment zone despite advances in the design of nzvi key technical challenges remain limiting its more widespread acceptance as a viable and competitive remediation technology fan et al 2016a fan et al 2016b these challenges mainly include poor selectivity and low subsurface mobility though the development of stabilizers he and zhao 2005 he et al 2007 phenrat et al 2010 schrick et al 2004 sun et al 2007 tiraferri et al 2008 has led to its increased mobility kocur et al 2013 limited research has been conducted to improve the selectivity of nzvi and to decrease its reaction with natural reductant demand processes in the subsurface most notably these include hydrogen evolution reactions with water eq 1 1 f e 0 2 h 2 o f e 2 2 o h h 2 decrease in hydrogen evolution has been observed after treating nzvi with lower valent forms of sulfur compounds i e sulfidation indicating that its reaction with water is inhibited to some extent fan et al 2016a fan et al 2016b nunez garcia et al 2016 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 this has led to improvements in the longevity nunez garcia et al 2016 and selectivity fan et al 2016a of nzvi particles for example during a sulfidated nzvi s nzvi treatability study 63 of the iron was still in the zerovalent state after 400 days nunez garcia et al 2016 sulfidation of nzvi has increased the removal efficiency of target pollutants such as trichloroethene tce han and yan 2016 kim et al 2013 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 1 2 dichloroethane nunez garcia et al 2016 tetrabromobisphenol li et al 2016 4 nitrophenol tang et al 2016 diclofenac song et al 2017 and metal ions cumbal et al 2015 fan et al 2013 su et al 2015 sulfidation methods can be classified as aqueous aqueous and aqueous solid depending on when the sulfur compound is introduced to the synthesis solution fan et al 2017 han and yan 2016 these methods have been reported to yield particles with varying physico chemical and structural properties but similar reactivity in dechlorinating tce han and yan 2016 it has also been reported that sulfidation decreases magnetic attractions between the particles which results in decreased aggregation and sedimentation song et al 2017 su et al 2015 among the various sulfidation precursors tested so far sodium dithionite na2s2o4 has been widely used in other field scale remediation applications such as in situ redox manipulation isrm amonette et al 1994 despite the increasing number of laboratory based s nzvi studies no study has yet investigated field scale s nzvi transport a number of studies have reported success related to the injectability and mobility of traditional polymer coated nzvi at the field scale bennett et al 2010 he et al 2010 johnson et al 2013 kocur et al 2014 however there is a need to assess the field applicability of emerging reactive formulations such as s nzvi this study presents a field scale demonstration showing the subsurface mobility of carboxymethyl cellulose cmc stabilized and na2s2o4 doped s nzvi suspension the specific objectives of this study were to 1 scale up and develop an on site field scale cmc s nzvi synthesis method 2 investigate changes to in situ geochemistry following cmc s nzvi injection 3 quantify in situ cmc s nzvi transport and 4 characterize field synthesized cmc s nzvi suspension before injection and in the multi level monitoring wells after injection this study builds upon our previous understanding of nzvi field studies chowdhury et al 2015 he et al 2010 kocur et al 2014 by investigating the horizontal as well as vertical distribution of the injected cmc s nzvi suspension 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description field work was conducted in sarnia ontario at a site adjacent to a demolished chlorinated solvents production facility during operation the study area was home to various utilities and sewers some of which might have been the cause of underground spillage groundwater at the site is contaminated with a mixture of chlorinated solvents including tetrachloroethene pce trichloroethene tce carbon tetrachloride ct and chloroform cf the presence of dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl was also visually confirmed between 4 and 5 m below ground surface bgs after operation the infrastructure was covered with a porous sandy material stretching east to west fig 1 and capped with an engineered clay layer hence borehole logs advanced with an ams powerprobe drill rig revealed three major sections composed of a clayey fill at the top non native sandy material in the middle and the native clay at the bottom of the geologic system these sections are not continuous containing in some instances traces of gravel brick and wood fragments the underlaying natural geologic unit is composed of brown weathered clay until 6 7 m bgs followed by a nearly impervious unweathered clay with hydraulic conductivities of 2 1 10 9 and 1 6 10 10 m s 1 kocur et al 2014 the water table was measured to be 1 5 m bgs throughout the study area 2 2 background conditions a reducing environment was already prevalent within the targeted depth of 4 12 4 42 m bgs oxidation reduction potential orp values ranged between 5 mv and 72 3 mv and ph was near neutral 7 0 0 56 daughter products from pce and ct dechlorination i e dichloroethenes dces and dichloromethane dcm were present in background samples suggesting the occurrence of natural attenuation or the influence of previous cmc nzvi injection performed at nearby wells in november 2010 kocur et al 2014 background conditions might have been impacted by this injection however due to the locations and layout of the current monitoring wells the past field trial is not considered to have affected the current cmc s nzvi injection conducted in november 2014 summarized data for the background geo chemical conditions are shown in table s1 total iron and boron concentrations ranged from 0 06 to 0 17 and 0 25 to 0 36 mmol l 1 respectively in the background samples injected iron and boron concentrations were greater than 100 times of the background concentrations therefore a background correction was not applied to the total iron and boron concentrations 2 3 installation of monitoring wells eight multi level monitoring wells mws and one injection well niw were installed each multi level mw consisted of seven color coded intervals 0 305 m apart with each having a screen length of 0 127 m fig 1 the screens were installed within a range of 2 9 4 9 m bgs during drilling well logs were obtained for transects corresponding to the wells na3 niw na1 and nb2 na4 could not be logged but this well is known to be sandy backfill due to its proximity to a sump that was emplaced in 2010 fig 1 shows a plan and a cross sectional view of well locations including a legend denoting the color codes for multiple well levels six intervals from black to white were monitored for nb1 and nb2 however groundwater monitoring targeted only depths between 4 12 and 4 42 m bgs which correspond to the blue and white intervals for most of the other wells fig 1 locations of greater depths were not sampled e g the red interval not shown in fig 1 located at 4 73 m bgs due to their close proximity to the source zone this configuration was selected to maximize capturing of horizontal as well as vertical extent of cmc s nzvi breakthrough downgradient of the injection well 2 4 cmc s nzvi synthesis and injection 620 l of s nzvi stabilized with 0 77 weight volume cmc were synthesized on site in four distinct batches 155 l each the mass and volume of each reagent used for the synthesis is reported in table s2 all reagents were dissolved in deoxygenated deionized water nzvi suspension was prepared by reducing ferrous sulfate a k petrochem ind ltd vaughn on with sodium borohydride gfs chemicals inc columbus oh in a process modified and optimized for field applications bennett et al 2010 he et al 2010 johnson et al 2013 kocur et al 2014 anoxic conditions were maintained by continuously purging the solutions and the headspace with high purity nitrogen gas praxair canada inc sarnia on the freshly synthesized nzvi suspension was then treated with na2s2o4 alfa aesar ward hill ma to yield final dithionite and nzvi concentrations of 22 mm and 18 mm 1 g l 1 respectively the fe0 content of the field synthesized batches was measured using acid digestion with hydrochloric acid 1 ml 32 hcl as reported previously nunez garcia et al 2016 before sulfidation the fe0 content was 85 0 of the theoretical total iron concentration after sulfidation acid digestion of cmc s nzvi formed a cloudy suspension and no h2 formation was observed fig s1 excess dithionite and its decomposition products e g thiosulfate remain in the cmc s nzvi suspension and cannot be decanted out during acid digestion thiosulfate consumes acid to form a cloudy white suspension of colloidal sulfur eq 2 johnston and mcamish 1973 2 h s 2 o 3 2 s s h s o 3 therefore quantification of the fe0 content was not possible for the cmc s nzvi solution aqueous solid sulfidation with dithionite likely due to the presence of thiosulfate or other dithionite decomposition products large scale on site synthesis of s nzvi with dithionite can present unique health and safety h s challenges and considerations though dithionite decomposition products can generate hydrogen sulfide h2s de carvalho and schwedt 2001 it has never been reported during the isrm applications in the field however during a preliminary cmc s nzvi synthesis trial for the current study h2s 6 7 ppm was detected near the vicinity of the synthesis barrel after adding dithionite although not near the breathing zone generation and off gassing of h2s might have come from the reaction of dithionite decomposition products with the excess hydrogen gas h2 formed from the borohydride hydrolysis during the nzvi synthesis borohydride is typically added in stoichiometric excess four times the amount needed for rapid and uniform growth of nzvi particles zhang and elliott 2006 to ensure sufficient time for the nucleation of nzvi particles and to allow the dissipation of h2 gas to minimize the h2s formation during the on site synthesis the nzvi suspension was continuously mixed for about an hour before adding dithionite the final cmc s nzvi suspension was mixed for at least 1 h before injecting into the subsurface because of the potential of h2s generation in large quantities during the aqueous aqueous sulfidation process as a result of direct reaction with borohydride the aqueous solid method is recommended as the preferred sulfidation approach for the on site synthesis of cmc s nzvi when using dithionite cmc s nzvi suspension was then injected by gravity over 16 h maintaining a constant head in the injection well injection rates ranged between 0 85 and 1 l min 1 during injection the hydraulic gradient was controlled for 32 h by using two recirculation wells 3 91 m downstream and 15 8 m upstream of injection well fig 1 to increase the advective flux throughout the study area the induced gradient between the recirculation wells was 0 088 compared to a natural gradient of 0 009 2 5 sample collection and analytical methodology to allow for the simultaneous sampling of all selected wells and intervals a multiple port set up was constructed quality assurance quality control field protocols were followed including notes recording observations in the field using dedicated and decontaminated sampling equipment and minimizing the aeration during sample collection all samples were collected in pre cleaned laboratory supplied bottles with suitable preservatives all bottles were clearly labeled with a designated sample identifier number analytical parameters and date and time of sampling the samples were immediately stored in insulated coolers with ice packs to maintain low temperature and shipped to the laboratory as soon as possible not exceeding the recommended maximum holding times geochemical parameters including orp and ph were measured on site using a water quality analyzer ysi 556 mps yellow spring oh samples for total iron sulfur and boron were digested and diluted with hydrochloric acid or nitric acid and then analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy varian vista pro axial santa clara ca analysis for sulfate was performed using a high performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a conductivity detector model 432 waters milford ma a 4 6 50 cm ic pak anion column wat007355 and 12 acetonitrile in water eluent colloidal stability of cmc nzvi suspension was determined for the samples collected before and after addition of dithionite using a uv vis spectrophotometer helios alpha thermo fischer waltham ma measurements were taken at 508 nm for 88 h at 10 min intervals it should be noted that all the samples were vacuum sealed immediately after collection to minimize oxidation during transportation to the laboratory and storage before analysis 6 24 h the uv vis absorption spectra were also obtained for cmc nzvi and cmc s nzvi suspensions from synthesis batches and for selected mw samples in the wavelength range of 200 900 nm zeta ζ potential and effective hydrodynamic diameter quantified by dynamic light scattering dls for the samples from synthesis batches and selected mws were determined using a zeta plus particle analyzer bic brookhaven holtsville ny and zeta plus software to determine the particle size and morphology of the

spectroscopy eds using the inca detector oxford instruments abingdon uk attached to the fei titan tem 3 results and discussion 3 1 horizontal mobility the cmc s nzvi suspension was quite mobile with significant transport to na4 blue and na3 white 2 7 m downgradient and 1 71 m upgradient from the injection well respectively at the first sampling time of 4 75 h fig s2 with time increased iron concentrations were also found in two other downgradient monitoring wells at a distance of 0 86 m nb1 white and 0 91 m nc1 white from the injection well the highest iron concentration was detected in nb1 white at 18 h after the start of injection reaching 1 31 mmol l 1 8 8 of the injected 14 9 mmol l 1 fig 2 a fig s2 in these four wells sulfate sulfur and boron concentrations often followed a similar trend as iron fig 2c figs s3a b notable upgradient migration of the cmc s nzvi suspension to na3 white might have occurred due to a localized gradient caused by the injection well higher iron concentrations at nb1 white na4 blue na3 white and nc1 white are also clearly illustrated in fig 3 where all the sampled wells were compared for their fe to b molar ratios fe b against the fe b ratio 0 39 of injected cmc s nzvi suspension both boron and iron would undergo dispersion diffusion and dilution but only iron particles are presumed to be removed from the aqueous phase due to filtration boron is stable in aqueous environments and can be found as boric acid h3bo3 and borate anion bo3 3 leenhouts et al 1998 uncharged h3bo3 is the dominant species found in most of the natural water systems and its surface adsorption is deemed unlikely due to the direct competition with water for available surface sites quast et al 2006 it has been shown that boron is conserved during groundwater transport and can be considered as a conservative tracer under many conditions leenhouts et al 1998 quast et al 2006 however borate ions are found to precipitate on the outer layer of the nzvi during its synthesis with borohydride nurmi et al 2005 it is possible that some boron might have retained in this manner and the boron concentrations reported herein are an underestimation for this reason boron is rather operationally defined as a conservative tracer in this study therefore deviation from the calculated fe b ratio represented by a straight line in fig 3 corresponds to the extent of retention of iron particles during transport to each well fig 3 shows that approximately 50 of the iron particles were retained during subsurface transport delivery of iron nanoparticles to greater distances have been previously reported for various nzvi formulations for example busch et al 2015 injected 1 2 kg of carbon iron colloids cic an activated carbon supported treatment containing 15 fe0 by weight and suspended in cmc through visual observations and gravimetric analysis it was estimated that 12 5 of the mass injected was delivered to the extraction well located at a distance of 5 3 m with a peak total iron concentration of 0 013 mmol l 1 0 74 mg l 1 however mobility results from the current study can be considered an improvement when compared to previous traditional cmc nzvi gravity fed injections in sandy media for example cmc nzvi was detected only 1 m downstream of another injection well in a previous trial at the current site kocur et al 2014 another study conducted in an engineered aquifer reported only 4 of the total injected iron at a well 1 m downstream johnson et al 2013 he et al 2010 observed a normalized peak total iron concentration of 15 and 3 in monitoring wells located 1 5 and 3 m downstream of the injection well respectively in other studies indirect measurements have been employed to confirm the breakthrough of iron using total solids ts and suspended solids ss as an indicator for nzvi wei et al 2010 reported travel distances to 3 m with minor changes at the furthest monitoring distance of 5 m one reason for improved mobility of cmc s nzvi could be the reduced inter particle magnetic attractions that would otherwise lead to sedimentation discussed in section 3 4 5 normalizing iron breakthrough to boron obtained by calculating the area under the c c0 1 vs time curve enables quantification of the extent of cmc s nzvi particle retention 53 4 and 55 9 particle breakthrough was observed at na4 blue and na3 white respectively the wells further upstream and downstream fig s4 good particle mobility was also observed at the other monitoring locations for example normalized breakthrough of 46 9 and 30 1 was quantified at nb1 white and nc1 white respectively using a similar normalization approach he et al 2010 reported 37 4 iron breakthrough in a well 1 5 m away from the injection point kocur et al 2014 reported a peak breakthrough of 75 when normalized to a tracer before decreasing to 50 for most of the injection period in a well 1 m downstream of the injection well this analysis should be used cautiously when both iron and boron are present in low concentrations for example nb2 white would seem to yield the highest transport with 73 6 breakthrough based on the normalized fe b areas fig s4 even though concentrations of iron did not exceed 1 4 0 2 mmol l 1 of the injected solution fig s2 data for na2 blue na1 white and nb3 white are not discussed here due to their low iron and boron concentrations cmc s nzvi transport was also quantified at 3 and 17 days after injection temporal changes in iron concentration were sometimes non monotonic following the cessation of injection iron concentrations decreased for na3 white na4 blue and nc1 white on day 3 fig 2b similarly the iron concentrations also decreased for nb2 green nb2 blue and all the intervals of nb1 table s3 however on day 17 concentrations remained relatively constant for na3 white nc1 white and nb2 blue increased for na4 blue nb2 green and nb2 clear and decreased for all the intervals of nb1 from black to white fig 2b and table s3 increase in concentration from day 3 to day 17 at na4 blue may be attributed to the preferential transport of iron from the injection well which still had retained high concentration of cmc s nzvi suspension under a natural gradient it is also noted that during injection cmc s nzvi reached na4 blue before the other wells fig 2 fig s2 given that na4 blue is the farthest monitoring well fig 1a it is suspected that site heterogeneities including preferential flow paths allowed the cmc s nzvi suspension to initially bypass nc1 white and nb2 white 2d laboratory studies phenrat et al 2010 as well as field injections bennett et al 2010 kocur et al 2014 have reported that polymer modified nzvi suspensions preferentially travel through the more conductive hydraulic pathways the sharp decrease on day 17 at nb1 all intervals which is closest to the injection well is likely affected by similar processes cessation of the cmc s nzvi source as well as by cmc s nzvi particle deposition on the porous media kocur et al 2014 it is important to note that the relatively high iron concentrations on day 3 represent a significant improvement in the stability of the particles when compared to previous field trials for example kocur et al 2014 reported a decrease in the normalized iron concentration from 50 during injection to 7 8 at 16 h after the injection 3 2 vertical migration and visual observations concentrations of both iron and boron increased with depth in the nb1 well with the highest recorded in the direct pathway of the injected suspension i e 4 4 4 5 m bgs fig 4 a b the color of the nb1 white groundwater sample was found to be dark black image not shown further supporting the highest concentrations of iron at this location the presence of cmc s nzvi suspension was also clearly visible in the upper levels of nb1 fig s5b indicating that particles travelled vertically 1 7 m up to the black interval which is 2 9 m bgs for nb2 located 1 78 m from the injection well the highest concentrations were measured at the blue interval i e 4 1 4 2 m bgs at 21 25 h also visually indicated by the dark black color of the nb2 blue groundwater sample fig 4c d fig s5b the metal concentrations were lower in the clear interval just above the blue interval as compared to the nb2 green with no significant change in the iron concentrations at the yellow and black intervals fig 4c d a similar trend was observed visually where nb2 green has a darker black color than nb2 clear fig s5b this could be due to the subsurface heterogeneity and preferential flow paths in contrast significant increase in boron concentrations was quantified at the yellow and black intervals of the nb2 well the presence of boron at the upper most intervals suggests that iron particles were retained during vertical transport of the injected solution to these sampling points though iron concentrations were not measured for all the levels for na4 the dark black color of groundwater samples indicates that the cmc s nzvi suspension had travelled vertically upwards even to the uppermost level of this well fig s5b similarly the upward migration of cmc s nzvi has been visually noticed for nc1 and na3 up to green and clear intervals respectively other studies have also reported vertical migration of zvi nzvi quinn et al 2005 velimirovic et al 2014 particles also remained in suspension at the blue and clear levels of nb1 at day 3 and day 17 fig s5c the presence of injected suspension is also clearly visible in na4 blue nc1 white nb1 white nb3 white and nb3 blue on day 17 fig s5d in fact suspended particles remained in the injection well for months following the injection period as observed from a sample collected at 196 days fig s5e having 13 8 of the injected iron 3 3 changes in groundwater ph and orp ph did not change significantly at any of the monitoring wells and remained near neutral 7 0 1 0 throughout the injection period fig s6 though ph is expected to increase due to the corrosion of iron by water other nzvi field studies have also reported less than anticipated increases kocur et al 2014 wei et al 2010 this suggests that dilution of the injected suspension and the buffering capacity of the subsurface media would moderate the effect of cmc s nzvi on the groundwater ph another reason could also be the limited corrosion of s nzvi by water he et al 2018 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 as the negatively charged s atoms on the nzvi surface would weaken its interaction with the h2o molecules by repelling the o atoms of h2o molecules gu et al 2019 orp was measured for discrete samples using a conventional platinum pt electrode during cmc s nzvi injection a sharp drop in orp was observed for na4 blue na3 white and nb2 white at t 4 h fig s7 which aligned with the arrival of cmc s nzvi suspension at these locations fig s2 there was also a gradual decrease in the orp for nb1 white and nc1 white the lowest orp 175 mv was recorded for na4 blue 6 h after injection this was followed by na3 white at 155 mv due to time constraints in the field it was not possible to allow for enough equilibration time for all the orp measurements therefore for some cases including nb1 white measurements were recorded within 5 10 min and actual orp values might be much lower than reported here decrease in orp was concurrent with the iron and sulfate breakthrough as shown in fig s8 for nb1 white these results indicate a significant influence of the cmc s nzvi injection on the aquifer geochemistry however the decrease in the orp was not as noticeable as reported in previous nzvi field studies johnson et al 2013 kocur et al 2014 wei et al 2010 changes in orp are a function of the redox couples contributing to the measured mixed potentials emix in the system for nzvi suspensions the major redox couples are h2 h and dissolved fe2 fe3 species shi et al 2015 past research has reported lower h2 evolution for s nzvi during its corrosion by water fan et al 2016a rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 thus the relatively mild decrease in orp in the current study might be due to the lower generation of h2 in the cmc s nzvi treatment as compared to the pristine nzvi the fe2 speciation and concentrations would also be different for the cmc s nzvi treatment compared to pristine nzvi nunez garcia et al 2016 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 moreover nzvi adsorption on the electrode and the type of electrode used also play a significant role in the orp measurements johnson et al 2013 3 4 characterization 3 4 1 tem eds detailed particle characterization can be used to help elucidate operative transport processes as well as to evaluate changes in nzvi particles due to sulfidation and subsurface transport tem eds analysis of the cmc nzvi before sulfidation suspension from synthesis batches shows that particles were primarily small discrete spheres and mainly composed of iron fig s9 however larger irregular structures representing iron oxy hydr oxides were also present though the synthesis vessels were constantly purged with nitrogen some level of oxidation is to be expected during the field synthesis the saed pattern for cmc nzvi consists of diffused rings indicating its amorphous structure tem micrographs of cmc s nzvi from the synthesis batches suggest that particles with two different morphologies were present following the sulfidation process figs s10 s11 most of the particles were small discrete spheres that resembled the nzvi particles from the unsulfidated nzvi suspension fig s9a these particles with an average size of 90 13 nm n 82 were also found to be similar in size to those previously reported for field synthesized nzvi kocur et al 2014 han and yan 2016 also reported that the appearance of spherical particles in s nzvi formed during treatment of nzvi with thiosulfate was akin to that of the unmodified nzvi the presence of oxygen observed in the eds scans of the smaller particles indicates that peripheral oxidation by water might have resulted in the formation of an iron oxide coating figs s10 s11 there was low or in some cases no sulfur s present in these nzvi like particles indicating either the presence of a small amount of iron sulfides fesx or their complete absence this suggests that a major portion of cmc s nzvi suspension was still comprised of nzvi like particles which would mainly be fe0 nunez garcia et al 2016 found most of the iron to be still preserved in the zerovalent state after nzvi sulfidation han and yan 2016 also detected the presence of fe0 in their s nzvi particles after thiosulfate treatment the saed pattern fig s11 for nzvi like particle in the cmc s nzvi shows that the rings are sharper and more distinct than that for the original cmc nzvi fig s9 some spots were also present in the cmc s nzvi sample this suggests that the amorphous nzvi particles have started turning crystalline the second type of particles were larger flake like structures figs s10 s11 composed mainly of iron and sulfur with an average particle size of 505 2 81 4 nm n 11 these were comparatively fewer in number fig s10b and were not observed in the unsulfidated cmc nzvi suspension fig s9 the morphology of these particles suggests that fesx distribution on some of the nzvi particles did not occur uniformly to form the typical core shell structure fan et al 2013 rather these particles were either overgrown into fesx flakes or the fe0 core was abundantly covered by the flaky fesx shell fan et al 2013 su et al 2015 2018 there is also a possibility that the few iron oxy hydr oxide particles present in the unsulfidated cmc nzvi suspension would have transformed to the larger fesx structures after dithionite addition particles recovered from nb1 white and nb1 clear 0 86 m from niw were similar in morphology to those found in the injected cmc s nzvi suspension fig 5 a c possessing both spherical and flake like structures in a previous nzvi trial in the adjoining area kocur et al 2014 also did not notice any significant morphological changes between the injected particles and those recovered from the monitoring well fig 5 shows that the nzvi like particles present as small discrete spheres 100 nm size had either low or no sulfur content as depicted in the eds spectra fig 5b c e1 e2 and e4 the eds spectra of larger flake like particles showing significant s peaks along with fe indicate the presence of fesx phase fig 5b c e3 and e5 fig s12 e1 e3 these distinct fesx particles were also easily found in the nb1 blue nb2 green and nb2 clear the latter two 1 78 m from niw figs s12 s13 however the small nzvi like particles were not easily detectable in these monitoring well samples the lower iron concentrations in these samples might have made it difficult to locate these particles during tem analysis these particles could also have oxidized sulfidized or retained as nzvi but aggregated into larger clusters for example a tem image of nb1 blue shows the presence of small spherical nzvi like particles that are clustered together and covered by a thick sheet of possibly fesx fig s12a1 tem eds data indicates that particles in the monitoring well samples collected at 18 and 72 h after injection are similar to those collected from the original cmc s nzvi synthesis batches saed pattern for the nb1 clear fig s12b inset shows well defined spots and visible rings indicating the polycrystalline nature of the particles it was interesting to see that the samples collected from niw at 196 days after the injection were still black in color indicating the stability of the injected suspension fig s5e over time exposure to oxygenated water from upstream would result in the oxidation of iron sulfides however the orp data shows that reduced conditions were still prevalent at this site fig s7 the presence of fe3 cl and so4 2 would also favor sulfide oxidation bibi et al 2011 in fig s14 tem images show the presence of nano spheres plate like particles and larger flake like structures presumably representing iron oxides oxy hydroxides and sulfides an et al 2017 reported the formation of lepidocrocite γ feooh and magnetite fe3o4 from oxidative dissolution of amorphous fes formation of akaganéite feo oh cl was observed during the oxidation of iron sulfides from chloride rich sulfidic sediments bibi et al 2011 the presence of cl peaks in the eds spectra of niw suggests the formation of feo oh cl and sulfur peaks indicate the presence of sulfides fig 5 e6 e7 during oxidation feo oh cl might have coated the surface of fesx to form fesx feo oh cl thus suppressing further oxidation of fesx jeong et al 2010 moreover the black color of the suspension also suggests the presence of iron sulfides or feii oxides feo fe3o4 feiii oxy hydr oxides if present might be a minor species 3 4 2 uv vis spectra fig s15a shows the absorbance spectra for cmc nzvi cmc s nzvi and nb1 white spectra for samples from other monitoring wells collected during active injection did not deviate from nb1 white fig s15b therefore nb1 white was chosen as a representative sample for comparison with cmc nzvi and cmc s nzvi the absorbance of cmc nzvi gave small peaks between 300 and 372 nm followed by a uniform decline up to 900 nm in contrast the cmc s nzvi spectrum sharply declined between 290 and 310 nm and then gradually decayed from 310 to 900 nm the spectrum obtained from nb1 white resembles that of cmc s nzvi though at a lower absorbance which would be due to its lower concentration it is also interesting to note that the nb2 blue spectrum showed significantly higher absorbance and resembles cmc s nzvi quite well nb2 blue was one of the samples with the darkest black color fig s5b and its iron concentration increased from 210 μm to 637 μm at the end of the injection table s3 to further compare these particles to the injected cmc s nzvi another groundwater sample from nb1 white was intentionally oxidized in the laboratory labeled nb1 whiteox by exposing it to air the nb1 whiteox spectrum differs from the cmc s nzvi and unoxidized nb1 white showing a more gradual decrease up to 550 nm and very little absorbance afterwards this data supports results from the tem micrographs suggesting that the recovered samples from monitoring wells were similar to the injected cmc s nzvi suspension experiencing minimal oxidation during the subsurface transport 3 4 3 particle size distribution psd tem provides information about the inner electron dense metal core and excludes the outer cmc layer thus dls was used to quantify the hydrodynamic diameter which includes both the metal particle as well as its outer cmc layer yielding the overall size of the particle the hydrodynamic diameter of unsulfidated cmc nzvi was 355 8 1 8 nm with a monomodal particle size distribution psd fig s16a however the psd changed to bimodal after addition of dithionite indicating the presence of two types of particles fig s16b these results are in alignment with the findings from the tem analysis for the multimodal psd the calculated hydrodynamic diameter does not give accurate particle size information thus the dls data for the samples with bimodal distributions is discussed in terms of size range rather than the median or mean diameter the size of smaller particles for cmc s nzvi ranged from 357 4 to 438 7 nm which is close to the hydrodynamic diameter of unsulfidated cmc nzvi particles the size of larger particles ranged from 881 to 1038 nm similarly the mw samples also showed a bimodal distribution supporting the presence of smaller nzvi like particles along with the larger fesx structures as shown in tem analysis figs s16c f some differences in the dls sizes of smaller particles for mw samples from the cmc s nzvi could be due to the variability associated with the field sampling however the size of larger particles for mw samples was significantly greater than that of cmc s nzvi particles this could be due to the formation of some larger clusters as seen in the tem micrographs for mw samples 3 4 4 zeta ζ potential zeta ζ potential 51 8 1 0 mv fig s17 for the unsulfidated cmc nzvi in the synthesis batches was consistent with those in the literature chowdhury et al 2012 kocur et al 2013 a less negative ζ potential 44 9 2 4 mv was observed after adding dithionite interestingly this was in contrast with the findings of previous studies where ζ potential was reported to be more negative after sulfidation and it was attributed to the presence of fesx on the surface of s nzvi particles kim et al 2013 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 tang et al 2016 however these studies used bare s nzvi particles that were washed multiple times with deoxygenated water and thus the supernatant from the synthesis was not retained in contrast s nzvi particles used in the current study were stabilized with cmc before sulfidation and the supernatant from the synthesis containing excess dithionite and its decomposition products e g thiosulfate sulfate was retained in the suspension moreover the na ions from the nabh4 na2s2o4 and na cmc were also present in the suspension even though the cmc s nzvi particles in the current study had fesx on the surface the presence of these anions and cations would significantly increase the ionic strength of the cmc s nzvi suspension resulting in less negative ζ potential saleh et al 2008 suponik et al 2016 the average ζ potential for multiple monitoring well samples collected during injection was 20 4 1 3 mv fig s17 which is less than half of the measured ζ potential for the injected cmc s nzvi suspension this differs from the study of kocur et al 2014 where the particles recovered from monitoring wells had similar ζ potential 48 3 2 3 mv to that of the synthesis batches 49 2 1 5 mv the further less negative ζ potential for monitoring well samples in the current study could be due to dilution tantra et al 2010 3 4 5 colloidal stability particle stability is a prerequisite for optimal nzvi delivery to the contaminated source zones as the settling of nzvi particles in the synthesis vessel before injection would limit the mass delivered to the subsurface kocur et al 2013 in the current study 50 5 of the unsulfidated cmc nzvi synthesized on site aggregated and settled after 72 h fig s18 this is consistent with the sedimentation curves from a similar study where only 50 of the cmc nzvi remained in the suspension at 24 32 h after on site synthesis kocur et al 2014 in contrast only 7 7 sedimentation was observed for the on site synthesized dithionite treated cmc nzvi i e cmc s nzvi after 72 h fig s18 this data suggests that the injected cmc s nzvi particles would stay suspended for much longer periods in the groundwater increasing their mobility and delivery to the contaminated areas recent studies have suggested that sulfidation of nzvi can effectively inhibit its aggregation and sedimentation gong et al 2017 song et al 2017 su et al 2015 2016 the rate of aggregation depends on a range of factors including particle concentration fe0 content particle size distribution and the thickness of adsorbed polymer in the case of stabilized nzvi phenrat et al 2010 within the core shell structure of nzvi the content of fe0 dictates the magnitude of inter particle magnetic attractions decreasing the fe0 content oxidation to less magnetic particles decreases nzvi aggregation and favors its transport resulting in enhanced mobility phenrat et al 2010 the greater stability of s nzvi has been attributed to the lower magnetic attractions between iron sulfides fesx su et al 2015 2016 for example gong et al 2017 reported a decrease in the saturation magnetization from 165 6 emu g for nzvi to 78 0 emu g for s nzvi though fe0 content of cmc s nzvi in the current study could not be measured details in section 2 4 our past research nunez garcia et al 2016 has shown a decrease in fe0 content and formation of iron sulfides after sulfidating the bare nzvi with dithionite thus the decreased aggregation and sedimentation of cmc s nzvi in this study can be attributed to the decrease in fe0 content and the formation of iron sulfides resulting in lower inter particle magnetic attractions 4 conclusions cmc stabilized s nzvi was successfully synthesized on site by the borohydride reduction method and aqueous solid sulfidation with sodium dithionite for field scale synthesis of relatively large quantities of s nzvi it is suggested to perform an aqueous solid sulfidation over an aqueous aqueous approach in order to reduce the possible generation of h2s to minimize health and safety concerns associated with side reactions between chemical precursors it is recommended to work near the stoichiometry amount necessary for borohydride and to optimize the concentration of dithionite by s fe ratio for the intended application in the present study the suspension was mixed for 1 2 h to allow time for the dissipation of any h2s generated tem images of cmc s nzvi synthesis batches revealed the presence of both discrete spherical nzvi particles as well as larger flake like structures associated with iron sulfides cmc s nzvi was found to possess better colloidal stability than cmc nzvi which could possibly contribute to its better transport in the subsurface approximately 620 l of cmc s nzvi was fed under gravity into a sandy aquifer by an injection well cmc s nzvi suspension was mobile in the subsurface achieving good horizontal and vertical distribution throughout the study area with detection in multiple monitoring wells both downstream and upstream of the injection well travel distances ranged from 0 9 m to at least 2 7 m which was the location of the farthest monitoring well tem eds analysis confirmed the presence of both nzvi like as well as fesx flaky structures in the mw samples similar to those identified in the cmc s nzvi synthesis batches this is further supported by the dls analysis which showed a bimodal particle size distribution for the mw samples similar to cmc s nzvi results reported herein demonstrate cmc s nzvi is highly mobile at the field scale and very stable both colloidal and chemical under subsurface conditions author contributions all authors contributed to the preparation of this manuscript and

introduction echinococcus multilocularis is a dangerous parasite responsible for the contraction of alveolar echinococcosis ae a potentially lethal disease which has been characterised as a neglected tropical disease by the world health organisation savioli and daumerie 2010 it is distributed in the northern hemisphere and areas of high endemicity include the area around the alps in central europe central asia including qtp turkey the kamchatka peninsula far eastern siberia and western alaska eckert et al 2001b e multilocularis life cycle includes canidae felidae and hyaenidae especially foxes and domestic dogs as the definitive hosts and small rodents as intermediate hosts eckert and deplazes 2004 romig et al 2017 humans become infected through ingestion of eggs as a result of contact with contaminated soil or infected animals ingestion of contaminated water and consumption of raw vegetables and fruits bastien et al 2018 eckert et al 2001a kern et al 2004 infection results in the metacestode phase located mainly in the liver eckert and deplazes 2004 moro and schantz 2009 ae mortality rate is high if left untreated it results in death in over 90 of the cases ammann and eckert 1995 wilson et al 1992 every year an estimated 18 235 new cases of ae occur with the vast majority 91 being recorded in china torgerson et al 2010 although china has been undertaking concerted efforts to reduce the threat of parasitic infections and echinococcosis in particular craig et al 2008 yang et al 2014 ae remains a critical threat the population infected with ae in china is estimated at 230 000 with another 22 7 million at risk torgerson et al 2010 in qinghai province alone the population at risk is estimated to about 5 4 million torgerson et al 2010 during a nationwide survey between 2012 and 2016 both cystic and alveolar echinococcosis prevalence were recorded at 1 28 out of a 332 884 population sample in qtp wu et al 2018 in highly endemic areas echinococcosis incidence rates are higher craig et al 2019 2008 and seroprevalence rates are much higher xu et al 2005 yu et al 1994 water is regarded as an important risk factor for ae contraction conraths et al 2017 martynenko et al 1983 yamamoto et al 2001 it has also been considered as a possible source of infection for other tapeworms belonging to the taeniidae family including e granulosus carmona et al 1998 craig et al 1988 dowling et al 2000 larrieu et al 2002 and taenia spp khairy et al 1982 the data on the distribution of e multilocularis eggs in the environment however is limited and fragmentary soil contaminated with e multilocularis eggs has been found in japan matsudo et al 2003 poland szostakowska et al 2014 and france umhang et al 2017 e multilocularis dna has been detected in raw vegetables and fruits lass et al 2015 while other studies have related environmental impurity to possible vegetable contamination bastien et al 2018 more recently e multilocularis dna was detected in water samples from lakes in a high endemic area relating background soil pollution to water contamination lass et al 2019 although such molecular studies have not shown echinococcus egg s viability they provided first and strong evidence that the eggs of this tapeworm may indeed be present in water and pose a threat to humans and animals until now most of the evidence indicating water as a possible source of ae transmission is indirect concerning case control studies and cross sectional environmental studies several studies conducted within and adjacent the endemic area of qtp have also emphasized the possible role of water on the transmission of the disease especially in highly endemic areas han et al 2015 tiaoying et al 2005 wang et al 2014 2006 yang et al 2012 this in large part results from the absence of centralized water supply and treatment in rural areas as well as poor sanitation conditions li et al 2019 wang et al 2014 2006 yang et al 2012 in some cases people in these

of the tapeworm no positive results were obtained with none of the detection methods used 3 2 results of molecular study of wastewater and water samples in total 222 wastewater and water samples were examined with nested pcr real time pcr and lamp assays the presence of e multilocularis dna was recorded in total in 13 of the samples 5 85 including 13 confirmed by lamp and real time pcr and 12 89 5 confirmed by nested pcr table 1 fig 2 and fig 3 e multilocularis dna was detected in samples collected from both wwtps the slaughterhouse and the area of the cattle farm while all samples taken from the three rivers were negative table 1 the results proved that all three molecular detection methods can be used to identify e multilocularis in environmental water samples with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity moreover each sample was checked three times via each detection method and the best reproducibility of positive results was observed with real time pcr followed by lamp and nested pcr table 2 of the 137 wwtp samples tested eight 5 8 were positive for e multilocularis significantly higher number of positive samples seven 7 1 was found in the huangyuan wwtp in comparison to xining wwtp with one 2 6 positive result among the samples collected from a slaughterhouse three 6 1 samples were positive for e multilocularis table 1 e multilocularis dna was also found in two of the 10 samples collected from the area of the cattle farm e multilocularis dna was not detected in any of the samples n 26 that were collected from the three rivers located in qinghai province table 1 sequencing of nested pcr positive samples displayed that the obtained products were fragments of the e multilocularis mitochondrial 12s rrna gene the sequences are deposited in the genbank table 2 e multilocularis sequences were confirmed in water samples taken from the two tested wwtps a slaughterhouse and a cattle farm additionally in order to exclude any cross reactions positive samples were tested for e shiquicus and e granulosus according to liu et al 2015 dna of e shiquicus and e granulosus was not detected in any of the samples investigated 4 discussion the current study provides direct evidence of the contamination of wastewater with e multilocularis eggs and the potential contamination of water sources to the best of authors knowledge this is the first investigation describing the detection of e multilocularis in water and wastewater samples collected from the territory of p r china using sensitive molecular tools namely lamp nested pcr and real time pcr assays in most of positive samples presence of e multilocularis dna was confirmed with all three independent molecular assays additional tests were performed in order to exclude any potential cross reactions taking into consideration that two other echinococcus species e granulosus and e shiquicus may coexist in the investigated area of qtp sequencing confirmed the presence of e multilocularis dna in 12 out of the 13 tested samples of which we obtained nested pcr products suitable for sequencing it has been previously shown that surface water in endemic areas is contaminated with e multilocularis lass et al 2019 and consequently may pose a potential risk for humans and animals and our present study shows different aspect of this issue e multilocularis eggs are indistinguishable from the eggs of other taenia spp via microscopic investigation pcr based methods have therefore been developed to detect this tapeworm s dna in various materials with high levels of specificity and sensitivity dinkel et al 1998 knapp et al 2014 trachsel et al 2007 recently lamp was also successfully used for the identification of e multilocularis in definitive hosts ni et al 2014 its specificity was previously evaluated with e granulosus and e shiquicus isolates here for the first time it has been shown to be effective with environmental samples results of this work also show that lamp may constitute a realistic alternative method for field surveillance of echinococcosis in endemic areas it can be applied as a useful rapid screening tool in large scale investigations not only for clinical material but also for environmental samples as clearly shown here moreover we show that all three methods used lamp real time pcr and nested pcr are suitable for investigating the incidence of e multilocularis in water samples with high sensitivity although e multilocularis was not detected in river water samples presence of the parasite in waterways is expected and most probably temporal contamination with parasite s ova depends upon raining periods as well as contaminating events like washing out of contaminated soil during a flood event or point discharge of contaminated wastewater the sampling site at guoluo river is close to the tibetan city of dawuzhen that has poor sanitary conditions and fox and canine activity is high indicating possible presence of echinococcus in the environment this is supported by the prevalence rate of echinococcosis amongst humans in the area which is very high liu et al 2015 the sampling method however is considered to have impacted on our findings due to the temporal variation and the low concentration of eggs in river water the frequency of detection in huangyuan further suggests the haphazardness of echinococcus detection when batch sampling is used since five out of seven positive results were found in only two out of 19 sampling sessions from huangyuan wwtp alternatively negative results in water samples may simply have been due to the relatively high limit of detection i e 20 ova l future efforts to improve the limit of detection and or processing of river water samples larger than 10 l may reveal more continuous contamination at lower concentrations ongerth 2013 therefore in future studies a continuous sampling approach for rivers is recommended where sampling corresponds to both a larger volume of tested water and a larger time frame e multilocularis was detected in both a meat processing factory and the corresponding wwtp that processes the wastewater smaller meat processing units are situated in the vicinity of xining where the examined large slaughterhouse unit is situated and in huangyuan where most positive samples were found within the wastewater treatment system meat industry can be assumed as the main possible contamination source due to the contribution of gut contents paunch manure from slaughtering along with animal faeces surface runoff in the case of combined sewer systems our findings provide further indications of dispersion of echinococcus contamination from the meat industry to the wwtps several studies have shown that other taeniidae eggs belonging to taenia spp can pass through activated sludge systems arundel and adolph 1980 ben ayed et al 2009 pawłowski and schultz 1972 pike 1985 the presence of helminth ova in the solid residues sludge produced by wwtps is well established and may become distributed on land through the disposal or agricultural use of wwtp sludge gyawali 2018 in a review it has been claimed that e multilocularis and t saginata was detected in treated wastewater effluent although the data were unpublished conraths and deplazes 2015 therefore detection of echinococcus in pre treated wastewater indicates a possible threat to water sources in the particular case of a major yellow river tributary running through densely populated urban areas this however needs confirmation by further studies this study further adds to previous findings of e multilocularis dna detection in lakes in endemic area in poland lass et al 2019 in the study by lass et al 2019 collection of water samples was performed with a specific set for filtration using capsule envirocheck filters which enabled the filtration of large volumes of water on site this approach decreased logistical problems by elimination the need for large containers to be filled with water and transported to the laboratory and increasing the number of samples that can be taken during a single survey comparison of the two filtration systems revealed that capsule filtration shows a bit better efficiency in comparison to filters used in this study positive results were noted at contamination of the sample with 10 eggs of the tapeworm only when capsule filters were used nonetheless the previous and the current study are complementary to each other and they will support efforts to establish a specific protocol for monitoring the presence of e multilocularis eggs in water samples the methods being discussed depending on the situation the financial and logistical parameters can be adapted to the local situation and applied for epidemiological investigation of water supplies for echinococcus especially that some environmental studies have already demonstrated presence of other taeniid eggs including e granulosus in drinking water sources dalu et al 2011 khairy et al 1982 stevenson and macpherson 1983 yousefi et al 2009 although the infectivity of eggs was not directly assessed since both studies were limited to molecular methods they further display the role of water in the environmental dispersion of e multilocularis eggs nevertheless the fact that three different molecular assays resulted in amplification of dna provides strong evidence for the presence of the transmission forms of this tapeworm in the particular study 5 conclusions e multilocularis tapeworm dna has been detected in wastewater samples that were collected from two wwtps and a slaughterhouse as well as the area of the cattle farm in qinghai province p r china a recognised endemic echinococcosis area the current results are another milestone in developing a protocol for the detection of e multilocularis in water samples to estimate the real waterborne transmission of e multilocularis to humans and animals this study provides evidence of the contamination of wastewater and stresses the potential role of water in the environmental dispersion of e multilocularis eggs the findings call for the consideration of the role of water in the transmission of the disease in such a strategy the appropriate education of the public on its role and the adoption of preventive and ameliorative measures against water contamination with e multilocularis eggs it must be emphasized that the threat of possible transmission of dangerous parasites such as e multilocularis via water cannot be dismissed anymore the results shown here call for attention and more intensive

introduction echinococcus multilocularis is a dangerous parasite responsible for the contraction of alveolar echinococcosis ae a potentially lethal disease which has been characterised as a neglected tropical disease by the world health organisation savioli and daumerie 2010 it is distributed in the northern hemisphere and areas of high endemicity include the area around the alps in central europe central asia including qtp turkey the kamchatka peninsula far eastern siberia and western alaska eckert et al 2001b e multilocularis life cycle includes canidae felidae and hyaenidae especially foxes and domestic dogs as the definitive hosts and small rodents as intermediate hosts eckert and deplazes 2004 romig et al 2017 humans become infected through ingestion of eggs as a result of contact with contaminated soil or infected animals ingestion of contaminated water and consumption of raw vegetables and fruits bastien et al 2018 eckert et al 2001a kern et al 2004 infection results in the metacestode phase located mainly in the liver eckert and deplazes 2004 moro and schantz 2009 ae mortality rate is high if left untreated it results in death in over 90 of the cases ammann and eckert 1995 wilson et al 1992 every year an estimated 18 235 new cases of ae occur with the vast majority 91 being recorded in china torgerson et al 2010 although china has been undertaking concerted efforts to reduce the threat of parasitic infections and echinococcosis in particular craig et al 2008 yang et al 2014 ae remains a critical threat the population infected with ae in china is estimated at 230 000 with another 22 7 million at risk torgerson et al 2010 in qinghai province alone the population at risk is estimated to about 5 4 million torgerson et al 2010 during a nationwide survey between 2012 and 2016 both cystic and alveolar echinococcosis prevalence were recorded at 1 28 out of a 332 884 population sample in qtp wu et al 2018 in highly endemic areas echinococcosis incidence rates are higher craig et al 2019 2008 and seroprevalence rates are much higher xu et al 2005 yu et al 1994 water is regarded as an important risk factor for ae contraction conraths et al 2017 martynenko et al 1983 yamamoto et al 2001 it has also been considered as a possible source of infection for other tapeworms belonging to the taeniidae family including e granulosus carmona et al 1998 craig et al 1988 dowling et al 2000 larrieu et al 2002 and taenia spp khairy et al 1982 the data on the distribution of e multilocularis eggs in the environment however is limited and fragmentary soil contaminated with e multilocularis eggs has been found in japan matsudo et al 2003 poland szostakowska et al 2014 and france umhang et al 2017 e multilocularis dna has been detected in raw vegetables and fruits lass et al 2015 while other studies have related environmental impurity to possible vegetable contamination bastien et al 2018 more recently e multilocularis dna was detected in water samples from lakes in a high endemic area relating background soil pollution to water contamination lass et al 2019 although such molecular studies have not shown echinococcus egg s viability they provided first and strong evidence that the eggs of this tapeworm may indeed be present in water and pose a threat to humans and animals until now most of the evidence indicating water as a possible source of ae transmission is indirect concerning case control studies and cross sectional environmental studies several studies conducted within and adjacent the endemic area of qtp have also emphasized the possible role of water on the transmission of the disease especially in highly endemic areas han et al 2015 tiaoying et al 2005 wang et al 2014 2006 yang et al 2012 this in large part results from the absence of centralized water supply and treatment in rural areas as well as poor sanitation conditions li et al 2019 wang et al 2014 2006 yang et al 2012 in some cases people in these

showed that e multilocularis dna was detectable using real time pcr nested pcr and lamp methods when the water sample was seeded with at least 200 eggs 10 l when water samples were seeded with 10 eggs of the tapeworm no positive results were obtained with none of the detection methods used 3 2 results of molecular study of wastewater and water samples in total 222 wastewater and water samples were examined with nested pcr real time pcr and lamp assays the presence of e multilocularis dna was recorded in total in 13 of the samples 5 85 including 13 confirmed by lamp and real time pcr and 12 89 5 confirmed by nested pcr table 1 fig 2 and fig 3 e multilocularis dna was detected in samples collected from both wwtps the slaughterhouse and the area of the cattle farm while all samples taken from the three rivers were negative table 1 the results proved that all three molecular detection methods can be used to identify e multilocularis in environmental water samples with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity moreover each sample was checked three times via each detection method and the best reproducibility of positive results was observed with real time pcr followed by lamp and nested pcr table 2 of the 137 wwtp samples tested eight 5 8 were positive for e multilocularis significantly higher number of positive samples seven 7 1 was found in the huangyuan wwtp in comparison to xining wwtp with one 2 6 positive result among the samples collected from a slaughterhouse three 6 1 samples were positive for e multilocularis table 1 e multilocularis dna was also found in two of the 10 samples collected from the area of the cattle farm e multilocularis dna was not detected in any of the samples n 26 that were collected from the three rivers located in qinghai province table 1 sequencing of nested pcr positive samples displayed that the obtained products were fragments of the e multilocularis mitochondrial 12s rrna gene the sequences are deposited in the genbank table 2 e multilocularis sequences were confirmed in water samples taken from the two tested wwtps a slaughterhouse and a cattle farm additionally in order to exclude any cross reactions positive samples were tested for e shiquicus and e granulosus according to liu et al 2015 dna of e shiquicus and e granulosus was not detected in any of the samples investigated 4 discussion the current study provides direct evidence of the contamination of wastewater with e multilocularis eggs and the potential contamination of water sources to the best of authors knowledge this is the first investigation describing the detection of e multilocularis in water and wastewater samples collected from the territory of p r china using sensitive molecular tools namely lamp nested pcr and real time pcr assays in most of positive samples presence of e multilocularis dna was confirmed with all three independent molecular assays additional tests were performed in order to exclude any potential cross reactions taking into consideration that two other echinococcus species e granulosus and e shiquicus may coexist in the investigated area of qtp sequencing confirmed the presence of e multilocularis dna in 12 out of the 13 tested samples of which we obtained nested pcr products suitable for sequencing it has been previously shown that surface water in endemic areas is contaminated with e multilocularis lass et al 2019 and consequently may pose a potential risk for humans and animals and our present study shows different aspect of this issue e multilocularis eggs are indistinguishable from the eggs of other taenia spp via microscopic investigation pcr based methods have therefore been developed to detect this tapeworm s dna in various materials with high levels of specificity and sensitivity dinkel et al 1998 knapp et al 2014 trachsel et al 2007 recently lamp was also successfully used for the identification of e multilocularis in definitive hosts ni et al 2014 its specificity was previously evaluated with e granulosus and e shiquicus isolates here for the first time it has been shown to be effective with environmental samples results of this work also show that lamp may constitute a realistic alternative method for field surveillance of echinococcosis in endemic areas it can be applied as a useful rapid screening tool in large scale investigations not only for clinical material but also for environmental samples as clearly shown here moreover we show that all three methods used lamp real time pcr and nested pcr are suitable for investigating the incidence of e multilocularis in water samples with high sensitivity although e multilocularis was not detected in river water samples presence of the parasite in waterways is expected and most probably temporal contamination with parasite s ova depends upon raining periods as well as contaminating events like washing out of contaminated soil during a flood event or point discharge of contaminated wastewater the sampling site at guoluo river is close to the tibetan city of dawuzhen that has poor sanitary conditions and fox and canine activity is high indicating possible presence of echinococcus in the environment this is supported by the prevalence rate of echinococcosis amongst humans in the area which is very high liu et al 2015 the sampling method however is considered to have impacted on our findings due to the temporal variation and the low concentration of eggs in river water the frequency of detection in huangyuan further suggests the haphazardness of echinococcus detection when batch sampling is used since five out of seven positive results were found in only two out of 19 sampling sessions from huangyuan wwtp alternatively negative results in water samples may simply have been due to the relatively high limit of detection i e 20 ova l future efforts to improve the limit of detection and or processing of river water samples larger than 10 l may reveal more continuous contamination at lower concentrations ongerth 2013 therefore in future studies a continuous sampling approach for rivers is recommended where sampling corresponds to both a larger volume of tested water and a larger time frame e multilocularis was detected in both a meat processing factory and the corresponding wwtp that processes the wastewater smaller meat processing units are situated in the vicinity of xining where the examined large slaughterhouse unit is situated and in huangyuan where most positive samples were found within the wastewater treatment system meat industry can be assumed as the main possible contamination source due to the contribution of gut contents paunch manure from slaughtering along with animal faeces surface runoff in the case of combined sewer systems our findings provide further indications of dispersion of echinococcus contamination from the meat industry to the wwtps several studies have shown that other taeniidae eggs belonging to taenia spp can pass through activated sludge systems arundel and adolph 1980 ben ayed et al 2009 pawłowski and schultz 1972 pike 1985 the presence of helminth ova in the solid residues sludge produced by wwtps is well established and may become distributed on land through the disposal or agricultural use of wwtp sludge gyawali 2018 in a review it has been claimed that e multilocularis and t saginata was detected in treated wastewater effluent although the data were unpublished conraths and deplazes 2015 therefore detection of echinococcus in pre treated wastewater indicates a possible threat to water sources in the particular case of a major yellow river tributary running through densely populated urban areas this however needs confirmation by further studies this study further adds to previous findings of e multilocularis dna detection in lakes in endemic area in poland lass et al 2019 in the study by lass et al 2019 collection of water samples was performed with a specific set for filtration using capsule envirocheck filters which enabled the filtration of large volumes of water on site this approach decreased logistical problems by elimination the need for large containers to be filled with water and transported to the laboratory and increasing the number of samples that can be taken during a single survey comparison of the two filtration systems revealed that capsule filtration shows a bit better efficiency in comparison to filters used in this study positive results were noted at contamination of the sample with 10 eggs of the tapeworm only when capsule filters were used nonetheless the previous and the current study are complementary to each other and they will support efforts to establish a specific protocol for monitoring the presence of e multilocularis eggs in water samples the methods being discussed depending on the situation the financial and logistical parameters can be adapted to the local situation and applied for epidemiological investigation of water supplies for echinococcus especially that some environmental studies have already demonstrated presence of other taeniid eggs including e granulosus in drinking water sources dalu et al 2011 khairy et al 1982 stevenson and macpherson 1983 yousefi et al 2009 although the infectivity of eggs was not directly assessed since both studies were limited to molecular methods they further display the role of water in the environmental dispersion of e multilocularis eggs nevertheless the fact that three different molecular assays resulted in amplification of dna provides strong evidence for the presence of the transmission forms of this tapeworm in the particular study 5 conclusions e multilocularis tapeworm dna has been detected in wastewater samples that were collected from two wwtps and a slaughterhouse as well as the area of the cattle farm in qinghai province p r china a recognised endemic echinococcosis area the current results are another milestone in developing a protocol for the detection of e multilocularis in water samples to estimate the real waterborne transmission of e multilocularis to humans and animals this study provides evidence of the contamination of wastewater and stresses the potential role of water in the environmental dispersion of e multilocularis eggs the findings call for the consideration of the role of water in the transmission of the disease in such a strategy the appropriate education of the public on its role and the adoption of preventive and ameliorative measures against water contamination with e multilocularis eggs it must be emphasized that the threat of possible transmission of dangerous parasites such as e multilocularis via water cannot be dismissed anymore the results shown here call for attention and more intensive

18284,combination of ultraviolet and chloramine i e uv chloramine treatment has been attracting increasingly attention in recent years due to its high efficiency in removing trace organic contaminants this study investigated the degradation behaviors of two pyrazolone pharmaceuticals i e isopropyl phenazone prp and aminopyrine amp and their genetic toxicity variations during uv chloramine treatment the results showed that chloramine could hardly degrade prp and amp while uv chloramine greatly increased the observed first order rate constant k obs of prp and amp degradation the quenching and probe experiments illustrated that the reactive chlorine species rcs contributed dominantly to prp removal and hydroxyl radical ho was the major contributor to the degradation of amp while the reactive amine radicals rns could hardly degrade them the overall degradation rates of prp and amp decreased as ph increased from 6 5 to 10 the k obs of prp and amp increased along with nh2cl dosage increasing and reached a plateau at higher concentrations 0 2 0 5 mm the present background carbonate hco3 1 10 mm chloride cl 1 10 mm and natural organic matter nom 5 10 mg c l 1 exhibited inhibition impacts on prp and amp degradation in addition the intermediates products of prp and amp were identified and their general degradation pathways were proposed to be hydroxylation deacetylation and dephenylization specifically cl substitution was inferred during prp degradation while demethylation in tertiary amine group was only observed in amp degradation these mechanisms including the main reactive sites of prp and amp were further confirmed by the frontier orbitals calculation moreover the results of the genetic toxicity according to the micronucleus test of viciafaba root tip indicated that uv chloramine treatment could partially reduce the genetic toxicity of prp and amp graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv chloramine pyrazolone pharmaceuticals reactive chlorine species hydroxyl radical degradation pathway genetic toxicity 1 introduction pyrazolone pharmaceuticals as the main type of antipyretic analgesics were frequently exposed to water environment because of their widely usage to treat the human disease monteagudo et al 2016 cai et al 2014 ternes 1998 due to the inefficient control of current wastewater treatment processes large amounts of pyrazolone pharmaceuticals from households and hospitals have been discharged into natural water environments which has brought worldwide concern due to their potential risks to human health and ecological systems tan et al 2013 miao et al 2015a cai et al 2014 two typical pyrazolone pharmaceuticals isopropylphenazone prp and aminopyrine amp have been frequently detected in surface waters 1 0 6 0 μg l nakada et al 2007 sewage treatment plants 2 5 251 0 μg l monteagudo et al 2016 and even drinking waters 1 0 36 0 ng l cai et al 2013 traditional bio chemical and physical treatment processes such as anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o coagulation sedimentation filtration cannot effectively control drugs contamination kosma et al 2010 kim et al 2006 yang et al 2017 mckie et al 2017 thus the disinfection process as the last guarantee of water safety has been becoming a pivotal unit to remove these pollutants previous research indicated that chlorine disinfection showed high efficiency for pyrazolone removal while it might produce undesired chlorinated disinfection by products dbps resulting in higher water quality toxicity cai et al 2013 because of the regulatory limitations of certain dbps alternative disinfectants have been sought to minimize the formation of dbps sedlak and gunten 2011 sharma et al 2014 chloramine which has shown superiority in reducing the potential of dbps formation is often used as an alternative disinfectant cheema et al 2017 besides chloramine is an ideal disinfectant to produce long lasting residual chlorine in municipal pipe system due to its stability he et al 2017 however chloramine has relatively low reactivity with organics resulting in the inefficient degradation of contaminants in short time for example β estradiol a benzenoid hormone could not be removed effectively by dark chloramine at the regular molar ratio of cl and n cl n 1 1 2 he et al 2017 therefore how to improve the utilization efficiency of dark chloramine during water treatment is still an important issue uv chloramine treatment has been attracting more and more attention in recent years due to its high efficiency to remove trace contaminants and advantage in controlling formation potential of dbps bu et al 2018 monochloramine nh2cl is always the dominant effective specie of chloramine chuang et al 2017 and it has been reported that uv chloramine treatment could generate amine radical nh2 and chlorine atom cl with the quantum yield of 0 50 mol e 1 as eq 1 zhang et al 2016 li and blatchley 2009 chuang et al 2017 cl could be transformed to hydroxyl radical ho by its reaction with hydroxide followed by the dissociation of cloh or be converted into the chlorine dimer radicals cl2 eqs 2 4 zhang et al 2016 li and blatchley 2009 chuang et al 2017 although nh2 has a lower redox potential than that of ho prior studies have shown that nh2 was capable of oxidizing antibiotics in wastewater and generating nh2 adduct products clarke et al 2008 nist standard reference database 40 2016 vikesland et al 2001 besides when the experimental solution ph was lower than 8 5 nh2cl could be converted to dichloramine nhcl2 and trichloramine ncl3 which could also form reactive species under uv irradiation soltermann et al 2014 nowadays uv chloramine treatment as a kind of advanced oxidation process aop to remove trace contaminants has received more and more attention for example 1 4 dioxane a heterocyclic pesticide and carbamazepine an antiepileptic drug could be removed effectively in uv chloramine treatment patton et al 2017 bu et al 2018 1 nh 2 cl u v

degrade pyrazolone pharmaceuticals because of their high reactivity while the generated dbps have risks to the water quality safety cai et al 2013 jia et al 2018 uv chloramine treatment as a disinfection process in wastewater and drinking water treatments to degrade pyrazolone contaminants has not been reported yet meanwhile the information of the specific reaction mechanism and the generation of dbps in uv chloramine treatment as a disinfection process was still limited besides the variations of water toxicity caused by pyrazolone pharmaceuticals before and after uv chloramine treatment should also be concerned compared to the acute toxicity the genetic toxicity appears to be a more important index because of its practical significance to evaluate the potential effects on human health wang et al 2014 iqbal 2016 overall the objectives of this research were i to examine the degradation kinetics of prp and amp ii to evaluate the contributions of different active species to the degradation of prp and amp iii to determine the degradation pathway and mechanisms of prp and amp iv to identify their genetic toxicity variations during uv chloramine treatment 2 materials and

in fig s1 in order to obtain a stable light intensity the uv lamp was preheated at least 30 min before experiments then a certain amount of chloramine stock solution was added to the uv reaction

of the experimental procedures were showed in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 the kinetics of prp and amp degradation in uv chloramine treatment fig 1 compared the time dependent decay of prp and amp in dark chloramination uv direct photolysis and uv chloramine treatments at ph 7 0 the prp and amp degradation in these processes followed first order kinetics and their observed rate constants k obs could be obtained by linearly fitting ln c c0 vs time the results showed that prp and amp could hardly be degraded by dark chloramination under uv irradiation prp and amp degraded with k obs of 0 0167 min 1 and 0 1482 min 1 respectively which might be attributed to the high uv absorption fig s3 and high quantum yields at 254 nm i e 0 052 mol e 1 for prp and 0 481 mol e 1 for amp as calculated in text s4 in uv chloramine treatment the k obs of prp and amp greatly increased to 0 0594 min 1 and 0 2761 min 1 at 0 5 mm nh2cl and ph 7 0 which were 3 6 and 2 0 times higher than that in uv photolysis alone the observed significant enhancement of prp and amp degradation might be ascribed to the contribution of reactive radicals generated by uv photolysis of nh2cl nh2cl has a relatively high uv molar absorbance coefficient i e 371 m 1 cm 1 at 254 nm and the quantum yield of 0 50 0 04 mol e 1 laat et al 2010 cooper et al 2007 li et al 2018 as mentioned above nh2 and cl were generated during uv chloramine eq 1 and then further transformed into a series of reactive free radical species such as hydroxyl radical oh reactive chlorine species rcs cl cl2 clo etc and reactive amine radicals rns nh2 no2 no nh2o2 etc patton et al 2017 laat et al 2010 the specific chemical reactions were shown in table s3 3 2 relative contributions of free radicals to prp and amp degradation during uv chloramine treatment to identify the individual contribution of uv and different free radicals to the degradation of prp and amp in uv chloramine treatment their k obs could be described as eq 5 5 k obs s k uv k chloramine chloramine k ho ho ss k rcs rcs ss krns rns ss where kuv represented the observed rate constant of prp or amp degradation by uv irradiation s was the screening factor of background compounds in the experimental solutions as calculated in text s5 and table s4 k chloramine was the observed rate constant by dark chloramination degradation which could be ignored for prp or amp as discussed above kho krcs and krns represented the second order rate constants of prp or amp reacting with ho rcs i e cl cl2 clo and rns nh2 no2 no nh2o2 respectively and ho ss rcs ss and rns ss were the steady state concentrations of these reactive radicals 3 2 1 the roles of rns in prp and amp degradation in uv chloramine treatment firstly to explore the reactivity of rns including nh2 nh2o2 with prp and amp in uv chloramine treatment we carried out the verification tests in uv h2o2 system at appropriate concentration of ammonia 0 5 mm and ph 10 0 and 7 0 using 10 mm phosphate buffer as shown in fig s4 the kobs of prp and amp was decreased apparently when the concentration of nh3 was 0 5 mm at ph 10 0 the ammonia radicals can be produced from fast reaction of ho and ammonia in aqueous solution by reaction eq 6 neta et al 1978 6 nh3 ho nh2 h2o k1 1 0 108 m 1 s 1 7 nh 2 o2 nh2o 2 k2 109 m 1 s 1 when the ph was at 10 0 the concentration of nh2 maintained a high level according to the eq 6 meanwhile a part of nh2 might reacted with the trace of dissolved oxygen in aqueous solution eq 7 the apparent decreasing suggested that nh2 and other rns exhibited low reactivity with prp and amp however the k obs of these two micro contaminants were almost not changed when the ph was at 7 0 the main species of ammonia was nh4 pka 9 7 at ph 7 0 which reacted with ho at much lower rate constant neta et al 1978 thus the nh4 of higher concentration did not quench ho yielding nh2 actually nh2 was expected to be unreactive towards organic compounds in other previous studies for example diethyltoluamide which has the similar structure to prp and amp could hardly be oxidized by nh2 in uv chloramine treatment zhang et al 2016 suggesting that primary amines and aromatics have limited reactivity with nh2 therefore the rate constants of prp and amp degradation in uv chloramine treatment could be further simplified as follows 8 kobs s kuv kho ho ss krcs rcs ss 3 2 2 the roles of ho and rcs to prp and amp degradation in uv chloramine treatment the tbuoh as the typical ho and cl scavenger reacts rapidly with ho and cl with the rate constants of 5 91 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 and 1 90 108 m 1s 1 gilbert et al 1988 respectively while the rate constant of reaction between tbuoh and cl2 was relatively low i e 7 102 m 1s 1 hasegawa and neta 1978 as shown in fig 1 k obs of prp and amp degradation decreased by 51 9 and 47 5 respectively with 10 mm tbuoh addition termed as uv chloramine tbuoh the obvious inhibition of k obs primarily suggested ho and cl played a dominant role in prp and amp degradation the discrepancies between the k obs of uv chloramine tbuoh and uv alone indicated that other reactive species such as cl2 and clo in uv chloramine treatment might also contribute to their degradation which were discussed as follows 3 2 2 1 ho radicals the contribution of ho to prp and amp degradation could be obtained by kho prp kho amp and kho ho ss firstly kho prp and kho amp were measured to be 5 43 0 12 109 m 1 s 1 for prp and 1 69 0 18 1010 m 1 s 1 for amp respectively by the competitive method using ba and nb as competitive compounds in uv h2o2 treatment the details were shown in text s6 secondly the ho ss was obtained by the depletion of a ho probe i e nb in uv chloramine treatment as expressed by eq 9 nb had a relatively low reactivity with other oxidants e g chloramine and rcs and was inert to uv photolysis in uv chloramine treatment thus the degradation of nb was mainly ascribed to ho oxidation fang et al 2014 watts and linden 2007 xiang et al 2016 9 l n n b t n b 0 k h o n b h o s s t where kho nb was the second order rate constant of nb which has been measured to be 3 90 109 m 1 s 1 in previous study buxton et al 1988 it was noted that the effects of the trace amount of nb on prp amp degradation in uv chloramine treatment could be negligible as the k obs of prp and amp with addition of trace nb were only 3 2 and 2 8 less than that of prp and amp without addition of nb as calculated the ho ss during prp and amp degradation by uv chloramine were obtained to be 6 52 10 14 m and 9 82 10 14 m respectively text s7 then the kho ho ss were calculated to be 0 0212 min 1 and 0 0995 min 1 for prp and amp which accounted for 35 7 and 36 0 of total k obs 3 2 2 2 rcs radicals the contribution of rcs to prp and amp degradation could be evaluated via eq 10 as follows 10 r rcs r r ho r uv where r was the overall removal rate of prp and amp in uv chloramine treatment rrcs rho and ruv represented the pseudo first order rate constants of prp and amp degradation by rcs ho and uv irradiation respectively according to the results above rrcs could be calculated to be 0 0243 min 1 and 0 0536 min 1 for prp and amp which accounted for 40 9 and 19 4 of total kobs based on the obtained tbuoh scavenging results and ho contribution the contributions of cl for prp and amp were calculated by subtracting rho from rho cl calculated by subtracting kobs of uv chloramine tbuoh from total kobs which accounted for 16 2 and 11 5 of total kobs respectively then the total contributions of other rcs such as cl2 and clo were calculated to be 24 7 and 7 9 for prp and amp respectively 3 3 effects of ph chloramine dosages and background anions on prp and amp degradation in uv chloramine treatment 3 3 1 effects of ph on the contributions of the active free radicals in uv chloramine treatment as shown in fig 2 the overall degradation rates of prp and amp gradually decreased with the increase of ph furthermore the contributions of uv photolysis radical oxidation by ho and rcs to prp and amp degradation at different ph were determined firstly the photolysis rates of prp and amp were not affected at the experimental ph range i e 6 5 10 0 where the uv absorption wavelength of prp and amp was not changed jia et al 2018 however k obs contributed by free radicals decreased from 0 0490 min 1 to 0 0128 min 1 for prp and from 0 1840 min 1 to 0 0970 min 1 for amp with ph increasing from 6 5 to 10 0 these phenomena could be attributed to the following reasons on the one hand nh2cl maintained at a higher concentration level and was more stable at ph 8 5 as mentioned in the previous literature bu et al 2018 when 6 5 ph 8 5 a small percentage of nh2cl was converted into dichloramine nhcl2 and hocl as eqs 11 and 12 the higher quantum yield of nhcl2 and hocl i e 0 82 0 08 mol einstain 1 and 1 0 0 1 mol einstain 1 respectively than that of nh2cl i e 0 50 0 04 mol einstain 1 increased the total free radical formation rate at lower ph laat et al 2010 feng et al 2007 on the other hand phosphate buffer exists mainly as the specie of hpo4 2 pka 7 2 in basic condition which scavenges ho faster than h2po4 the main species at ph 6 5 and 7 0 eqs 13 and 14 wu et al 2019 therefore the steady state concentrations of oh decreased at higher ph 8 5 10 0 conditions 11 2nh2cl h nh4 nhcl2 12 nhcl2 h2o hocl nh2cl 13 ho hpo4 2 hpo4 oh k11 1 5 105 m 1 s 1 14 ho h2po4 hpo4 h2o k12 2 0 104 m 1 s 1 furthermore for the pyrazolone degradation by radicals oxidation the relative contributions of ho and rcs were discussed as the ratio of k obs ho k obs rcs shown in table s6 at ph 6 5 and ph 7 the ratio of k obs ho k obs rcs for prp was 0 74 and 0 89 suggesting that rcs contributed more than ho to prp degradation with the increase of ph the ratio of k obs ho k obs rcs increased to 1 61 indicating ho primarily contributed to prp degradation at alkaline condition the overall increasing contribution of ho was attributed to that ph affected the transformation of cl into ho via cloh and accelerated the transformation of cl to ho with ph increasing fang et al 2014 for amp the ratio of k obs ho k obs rcs was greater than 1 at all ph and increased from 1 10 to 1 70 as ph increasing from 6 5 to 10 0 indicating that ho was always the predominant contributor to amp degradation the higher contribution of ho might be owing to the high activity of tertiary amine group of amp the previous study had reported that ho was inclined to attack the tertiary amine group of amp directly by demethylation miao et al 2015b 3 3 2 effects of chloramine dosages on prp and amp degradation in uv chloramine treatment fig 3 showed the k obs of prp and amp during uv chloramine treatment under different chloramine dosages i e 0 01 1 0 mm as the chloramine dosage increased from 0 01 mm to 0 2 mm the corresponding k obs of prp and amp increased gradually from 0 0415 min 1 and 0 197 min 1 to 0 0570 min 1 and 0 271 min 1 respectively with further increased chloramine dosage to 1 0 mm the k obs increased slightly and reached a plateau the augment of observed synergistic degradation rates for prp and amp might stem from more generation of rcs and ho with the increase of nh2cl dosage however as the radicals scavenger nh2cl might react with cl and ho yielding inert reactive radicals such as nhcl a low oxidicability free radical eqs 15 and 16 which weakened the enhancement of radical oxidation to prp and amp degradation li et al 2018 15 cl nh2cl nhcl h cl k13 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 16 ho nh2cl nhcl h2o k14 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 3 3 3 effects of background matrices in natural water on prp and amp degradation in uv chloramine treatment the common present background matrices such as hco3 cl and srnom may affect pyrazolone degradation during uv chloramine treatment fig 4 showed the effects of different concentrations of hco3 1 10 mm cl 1 10 mm and srnom 5 10 mg l on the degradation of prp and amp during uv chloramine treatment effect of hco 3 for prp 1 5 mm hco3 could slightly decrease the k obs prp from 0 0594 min 1 to 0 0534 min 1 for amp the k obs amp decreased slightly from 0 2761 min 1 to 0 2265 min 1 the existence of hco3 in uv chloramine consumed the radicals with the high second order rates eqs 17 19 bu et al 2018 the main product of the reactions was carbonate radicals co3 which was a lower oxidation potential radical and selectively oxidized contaminants zhang et al 2015 the previous studies had reported that co3 could react with amines i e aniline the uracil functional compounds and 4 methyaniline with 1 4 9 1 108 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 similarly co3 is possibly to react with prp and amp with lower rate constants compared with ho and rcs thus the overall degradation rates of prp and amp in uv chloramine treatment always decreased when hco3 existed 17 cl hco3 co3 h cl k15 2 2 108 m 1 s 1 18 ho hco3 co3 h2o k16 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 19 cl2 hco3 co3 h 2cl k17 8 0 107 m 1 s 1 effect of cl as the concentration of cl increased gradually from 0 to 1 mm the k obs prp increased and then gradually decreased with further increasing cl to 10 mm as shown in fig 4a cl could react rapidly with ho yielding cloh which could be reversibly transformed into ho with the same generation rate of cloh under the neutral basic conditions xiao et al 2016 thus the reaction of cl with ho could be negligible however cl also reacts rapidly with cl to produce cl2 fang et al 2014 the generation of cl2 in the presence of 1 mm cl enhanced the degradation of prp which agreed with the result that prp could be removed by cl2 as discussed in section 3 2 2 however higher concentration of cl caused the radical self scavenging reactions of cl2 with cl2 cl with cl2 i e eqs 20 and 21 hence when the concentration of cl increased to 10 mm the k obs prp slightly reduced from 0 2761 min 1 to 0 2241 min 1 for amp as shown in fig 4b the k obs amp gradually decreased in the cl presence of 1 10 mm suggesting lower oxidation of amp by cl2 which was in consistent with the above speculation i e amp could be primarily degraded by uv irradiation and ho section 3 2 2 20 cl cl2 cl2 cl k19 2 1 109 m 1 s 1 21 cl2 cl2 cl2 2cl k20 9 0 108 m 1 s 1 effect of srnom as shown in fig 4 k obs prp gradually reduced from 0 0594 min 1 to 0 0345 min 1 fig 4a while k obs amp decreased from 0 2761 min 1 to 0 1324 min 1 fig 4b with the srnom concentration increasing from 0 to 10 mg c l 1 meanwhile with addition of 10 mg c l 1 srnom only 27 1 of prp and 65 4 of amp were removed in uv chloramine treatment after reaction time of 30 min in general srnom acted as scavenger of radicals e g cl and ho eqs 22 and 23 and uv absorption shielding the shielding factor were given in text s4 leading to the reduction of steady state concentrations of ho and rcs cl nom products k18 1 3 104 mg l 1 s 1 22 ho nom products k19 2 5 104 mg l 1 s 1 23 in real waters the degradation efficiencies of prp and amp in real waters including two surface waters and a sewage plant biological effluent were further investigated and the results were shown in fig s7 compared to that in pure water the k obs of prp and amp in these three real waters were slightly declined 3 0 12 9 8 19 respectively this might be ascribed to the quenching effect of reactive radicals by water matrices such as hco3 cl and dissolved organic matters doms and the uv absorption shielding by doms the relative higher decrease of k obs amp than k obs prp in real waters might be due to the lower oxidation of amp by cl2 formed in the presence of cl 110 195 mg l 3 10 5 50 mm in real waters as given in table s2 which was discussed above 3 4 degradation mechanism of prp and amp in uv chloramine treatment 3 4 1 prediction of reaction sites by quantum chemical computation to evaluate the preferential reaction sites the frontier molecular orbitals fmo of prp and amp were calculated fig 5 it was illustrated that the electrophilic reactions of free radicals tended to take place at the electron rich regions of homo but the nucleophilic reaction more readily occurred in the regions of lumo frisch et al 2009 it could be preliminarily given that the main active sites of prp and amp were c h at para benzene ring c n and cc furthermore the specific tertiary amine group of amp was more reactive than isopropyl of prp because of its higher electronic cloud density additionally the evaluated values of feds 2fed2 homo and fed2 homo fed2 lumo which can characterize the potential of the reactive sites for electron transfer were calculated based on the optimized structure in table s7 and fig s8 lu and chen 2012 for these two drugs the relatively high 2fed2 homo values of the contrapuntal c in benzene 6c co 9c and the c contacted with the pyrazole ring 3c meant the easier electron transfer by oh or rcs radicals specifically the 2fed2 homo and fed2 homo fed2 lumo values of 14c in isopropyl for prp were 1 71 10 7 and 1 36 10 6 table s7 respectively meanwhile compared with isopropyl 14c of prp the 14n of the tertiary amine group of amp possessed the higher value of feds to be 3 64 10 4 and 1 82 10 4 respectively which indicated the higher reactivity with active radicals 3 4 2 degradation pathway of prp and amp in uv chloramine treatment the degradation intermediates and products were monitored by lc ms ms analysis during uv chloramine treatment nine intermediates of prp and ten intermediates of amp table s8 were detected and the isomers were distinguished by their different retention times based on the reactive sites proposed by the theoretical calculation pathways and mechanism of prp and amp degradation in uv chloramine treatment were proposed as given in fig 6 to be noted that the degradation pathways of other chlorine related disinfection methods cl2 and clo2 obtained from our previous studies jia et al 2018 cai et al 2014 were compared to explore the degradation mechanism of pyrazolone drugs under different disinfection treatments as shown in fig 6 a prp was degraded by four routes i chlorine substitution route i was observed in the para position of benzene ring to form p3 by rcs rcs attacked prp by electrophilic substitution as mentioned in other aromatic hydrocarbons such as ibuprofen xiang et al 2016 this could also be proved by higher fed value of 6c fig s8 as calculated in text s6 ii furthermore the hydroxylation route ii reaction by ho mainly occurred on the benzene ring and the methyl group connected with the cc to yield p1 and p2 respectively then p1 could be further oxidized to form alcohols p5 and aldehydes p6 p7 and p2 was oxidized to form p4 with demethylation on 2n position besides the generation of p7 might be attributed to the uv photolysis iii decarbonylation occurred in pyrazole ring route iii firstly the cc of prp was split into two carbonyl groups by ho and rcs attacking and the ring opening reaction of pyrazole ring occurred to form p the predicted product presumably as isopropyl is a weak electron donating group the electron donating effect increased the electron density of the cc making it easier to be attacked by active radicals after that the decarbonylation could form p8 by ho and rcs attacking the exposed c n meanwhile the uv irradiation made the cc more active and accelerated the decarbonylation above jia et al 2018 iv dephenylization route iv was the pyrazole ring broken from benzene ring to form p9 which was the subordinate pathway for prp degradation mainly by uv irradiation and free radical oxidation fig 6 b showed the amp degradation pathway during uv chloramine treatment i the hydroxylation reaction by ho occurred on different sites to form p6 p8 and p9 then p6 was further converted into aldehydes p7 the products analysis results showed that the hydroxylation reaction mainly occurred on the benzene ring and the methyl group attached to cc ii demethylation occurred in tertiary amines of amp to form p1 which converted to p2 and alcohol p4 as mentioned above the tertiary amines attached to position 4c of amp pyrazole ring was a strong electron donating group the single electron on 6n can form a p π conjugate system with cc and further generate the electron donating conjugate effect the activity of tertiary amine group made the demethylation route ii to be the dominant reaction pathway of amp degradation by the oxidation of ho meanwhile previous studies showed that tertiary amine as the most common h donor was easier to react with ho via electron transformation under uv irradiation davidson 1996 iii decarbonylation the open loop reaction of cc by ho and rcs attacking occurred similarly with prp degradation to generate p3 and p5 iv dephenylization was also the main pathway for amp to form p10 compared to cl2 and clo2 treatment the degradation pathway and mechanism in uv chloramine treatment were more complicated previous study showed that cl2 disinfection reactions of prp and amp were mainly hydroxylation and chlorine substitution while clo2 reactions of prp and amp were mainly deacetylation the degradation pathways of prp and amp in cl2 and clo2 disinfection treatment were almost contained in uv chloramine treatment therein dephenylization specifically occurred in uv chloramine treatment because of uv irradiation and free radicals oxidation specially demethylation reaction in tertiary amine group of amp only happened in uv chloramine treatment which was attributed to the oxidation by ho enhancing amp degradation partly miao et al 2015b the more complex degradation mechanism for prp and amp in uv chloramine treatment was owing to the higher oxidic ability and non selectivity of free radicals compared to cl2 and clo2 3 5 genetic toxicity variation of prp and amp during uv chloramine treatment in order to explore the dosage effects on the toxicity different concentrations of pyrazolone 0 1 and 0 5 mm and chloramine 0 1 0 5 and 1 0 mm were added to the reaction system the negative control without pyrazolone and chloramine was exposed to milli q water to obtain the mutagenicity of background the indicators of genetic toxicity were represented with micronucleus frequency mcn and micronucleus index mci which followed the eqs 22 and 23 and the results were given in table 1 mci indicated the relative toxicity of experimental group and the significant mutagenicity could be identified when the values of mci were greater than 1 5 khadra et al 2012 the influence of the residual na2s2o3 was found to be negligible in the toxicity experiments based on the similar mcn values mcn 1 90 with negative groups mcn 1 86 22 mcn number of micronucleys cells numble of total cells 1000 23 mci mcn of experimental group mcn of negative control group mci of blank control groups i e prp amp 0 0 1 or 0 5 mm nh2cl 0 0 mm exhibited the background toxicity level of prp or amp contaminated water and the values of mci ranged from 8 91 to 15 34 which were higher than negative control i e 1 00 p 0 01 these results indicated that the toxicity of prp and amp significantly affected the water quality after uv chloramine disinfection the maximum toxicities of prp and amp decreased by 9 7 and 19 3 which indicated uv chloramine disinfection could partly reduce the toxicity of water containing pyrazolone compared with rpr the higher reduction extent of amp might be ascribed to the more complete degradation of amp based on the above kinetic results and products analysis meanwhile the total organic carbon toc concentrations in the reaction system after uv chloramine treatment decreased by 4 and 8 for prp and amp respectively these results suggested that uv chloramine disinfection could reduce pyrazolone contaminated water toxicity to some extent 4 conclusion participation of uv can significantly enhance the capacity of chloramine to remove prp and amp the degradation of prp and amp in uv chloramine treatment followed pseudo first order kinetics and the rate constants were 0 0594 min 1 and 0 2761 min 1 respectively in uv chloramine treatment ho and rcs contributed 35 7 and 40 9 for prp degradation while 36 0 and 19 4 for amp degradation the k obs of prp and amp decreased with increasing ph from 6 5 to 10 0 and increased nonlinearly with increasing chloramine dosage it was observed that low concentration of cl i e 1 mm could enhance prp degradation due to the generation of cl2 which exhibited higher reactivity with prp however 1 10 mm hco3 and 5 10 mg l nom inhibited prp and amp degradation based on the theoretical calculation and products analysis the degradation products of prp and amp were similarly produced from the reaction of hydroxylation demethylation deacetylation and dephenylization while the reaction of chlorine substitution was only occurred in prp degradation interestingly the susceptible reaction of amp with ho due to the electron rich properties of the specific tertiary amine group enhanced the degradability of amp the genetic toxicities of prp and amp were observed to be partially reduced by uv chloramine treatment notably compared to cl2 and clo2 disinfection the prp and amp degradation were more complete in uv chloramine treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

18284,combination of ultraviolet and chloramine i e uv chloramine treatment has been attracting increasingly attention in recent years due to its high efficiency in removing trace organic contaminants this study investigated the degradation behaviors of two pyrazolone pharmaceuticals i e isopropyl phenazone prp and aminopyrine amp and their genetic toxicity variations during uv chloramine treatment the results showed that chloramine could hardly degrade prp and amp while uv chloramine greatly increased the observed first order rate constant k obs of prp and amp degradation the quenching and probe experiments illustrated that the reactive chlorine species rcs contributed dominantly to prp removal and hydroxyl radical ho was the major contributor to the degradation of amp while the reactive amine radicals rns could hardly degrade them the overall degradation rates of prp and amp decreased as ph increased from 6 5 to 10 the k obs of prp and amp increased along with nh2cl dosage increasing and reached a plateau at higher concentrations 0 2 0 5 mm the present background carbonate hco3 1 10 mm chloride cl 1 10 mm and natural organic matter nom 5 10 mg c l 1 exhibited inhibition impacts on prp and amp degradation in addition the intermediates products of prp and amp were identified and their general degradation pathways were proposed to be hydroxylation deacetylation and dephenylization specifically cl substitution was inferred during prp degradation while demethylation in tertiary amine group was only observed in amp degradation these mechanisms including the main reactive sites of prp and amp were further confirmed by the frontier orbitals calculation moreover the results of the genetic toxicity according to the micronucleus test of viciafaba root tip indicated that uv chloramine treatment could partially reduce the genetic toxicity of prp and amp graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv chloramine pyrazolone pharmaceuticals reactive chlorine species hydroxyl radical degradation pathway genetic toxicity 1 introduction pyrazolone pharmaceuticals as the main type of antipyretic analgesics were frequently exposed to water environment because of their widely usage to treat the human disease monteagudo et al 2016 cai et al 2014 ternes 1998 due to the inefficient control of current wastewater treatment processes large amounts of pyrazolone pharmaceuticals from households and hospitals have been discharged into natural water environments which has brought worldwide concern due to their potential risks to human health and ecological systems tan et al 2013 miao et al 2015a cai et al 2014 two typical pyrazolone pharmaceuticals isopropylphenazone prp and aminopyrine amp have been frequently detected in surface waters 1 0 6 0 μg l nakada et al 2007 sewage treatment plants 2 5 251 0 μg l monteagudo et al 2016 and even drinking waters 1 0 36 0 ng l cai et al 2013 traditional bio chemical and physical treatment processes such as anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o coagulation sedimentation filtration cannot effectively control drugs contamination kosma et al 2010 kim et al 2006 yang et al 2017 mckie et al 2017 thus the disinfection process as the last guarantee of water safety has been becoming a pivotal unit to remove these pollutants previous research indicated that chlorine disinfection showed high efficiency for pyrazolone removal while it might produce undesired chlorinated disinfection by products dbps resulting in higher water quality toxicity cai et al 2013 because of the regulatory limitations of certain dbps alternative disinfectants have been sought to minimize the formation of dbps sedlak and gunten 2011 sharma et al 2014 chloramine which has shown superiority in reducing the potential of dbps formation is often used as an alternative disinfectant cheema et al 2017 besides chloramine is an ideal disinfectant to produce long lasting residual chlorine in municipal pipe system due to its stability he et al 2017 however chloramine has relatively low reactivity with organics resulting in the inefficient degradation of contaminants in short time for example β estradiol a benzenoid hormone could not be removed effectively by dark chloramine at the regular molar ratio of cl and n cl n 1 1 2 he et al 2017 therefore how to improve the utilization efficiency of dark chloramine during water treatment is still an important issue uv chloramine treatment has been attracting more and more attention in recent years due to its high efficiency to remove trace contaminants and advantage in controlling formation potential of dbps bu et al 2018 monochloramine nh2cl is always the dominant effective specie of chloramine chuang et al 2017 and it has been reported that uv chloramine treatment could generate amine radical nh2 and chlorine atom cl with the quantum yield of 0 50 mol e 1 as eq 1 zhang et al 2016 li and blatchley 2009 chuang et al 2017 cl could be transformed to hydroxyl radical ho by its reaction with hydroxide followed by the dissociation of cloh or be converted into the chlorine dimer radicals cl2 eqs 2 4 zhang et al 2016 li and blatchley 2009 chuang et al 2017 although nh2 has a lower redox potential than that of ho prior studies have shown that nh2 was capable of oxidizing antibiotics in wastewater and generating nh2 adduct products clarke et al 2008 nist standard reference database 40 2016 vikesland et al 2001 besides when the experimental solution ph was lower than 8 5 nh2cl could be converted to dichloramine nhcl2 and trichloramine ncl3 which could also form reactive species under uv irradiation soltermann et al 2014 nowadays uv chloramine treatment as a kind of advanced oxidation process aop to remove trace contaminants has received more and more attention for example 1 4 dioxane a heterocyclic pesticide and carbamazepine an antiepileptic drug could be removed effectively in uv chloramine treatment patton et al 2017 bu et al 2018 1 nh 2 cl u v

degrade pyrazolone pharmaceuticals because of their high reactivity while the generated dbps have risks to the water quality safety cai et al 2013 jia et al 2018 uv chloramine treatment as a disinfection process in wastewater and drinking water treatments to degrade pyrazolone contaminants has not been reported yet meanwhile the information of the specific reaction mechanism and the generation of dbps in uv chloramine treatment as a disinfection process was still limited besides the variations of water toxicity caused by pyrazolone pharmaceuticals before and after uv chloramine treatment should also be concerned compared to the acute toxicity the genetic toxicity appears to be a more important index because of its practical significance to evaluate the potential effects on human health wang et al 2014 iqbal 2016 overall the objectives of this research were i to examine the degradation kinetics of prp and amp ii to evaluate the contributions of different active species

amp in dark chloramination uv direct photolysis and uv chloramine treatments at ph 7 0 the prp and amp degradation in these processes followed first order kinetics and their observed rate constants k obs could be obtained by linearly fitting ln c c0 vs time the results showed that prp and amp could hardly be degraded by dark chloramination under uv irradiation prp and amp degraded with k obs of 0 0167 min 1 and 0 1482 min 1 respectively which might be attributed to the high uv absorption fig s3 and high quantum yields at 254 nm i e 0 052 mol e 1 for prp and 0 481 mol e 1 for amp as calculated in text s4 in uv chloramine treatment the k obs of prp and amp greatly increased to 0 0594 min 1 and 0 2761 min 1 at 0 5 mm nh2cl and ph 7 0 which were 3 6 and 2 0 times higher than that in uv photolysis alone the observed significant enhancement of prp and amp degradation might be ascribed to the contribution of reactive radicals generated by uv photolysis of nh2cl nh2cl has a relatively high uv molar absorbance coefficient i e 371 m 1 cm 1 at 254 nm and the quantum yield of 0 50 0 04 mol e 1 laat et al 2010 cooper et al 2007 li et al 2018 as mentioned above nh2 and cl were generated during uv chloramine eq 1 and then further transformed into a series of reactive free radical species such as hydroxyl radical oh reactive chlorine species rcs cl cl2 clo etc and reactive amine radicals rns nh2 no2 no nh2o2 etc patton et al 2017 laat et al 2010 the specific chemical reactions were shown in table s3 3 2 relative contributions of free radicals to prp and amp degradation during uv chloramine treatment to identify the individual contribution of uv and different free radicals to the degradation of prp and amp in uv chloramine treatment their k obs could be described as eq 5 5 k obs s k uv k chloramine chloramine k ho ho ss k rcs rcs ss krns rns ss where kuv represented the observed rate constant of prp or amp degradation by uv irradiation s was the screening factor of background compounds in the experimental solutions as calculated in text s5 and table s4 k chloramine was the observed rate constant by dark chloramination degradation which could be ignored for prp or amp as discussed above kho krcs and krns represented the second order rate constants of prp or amp reacting with ho rcs i e cl cl2 clo and rns nh2 no2 no nh2o2 respectively and ho ss rcs ss and rns ss were the steady state concentrations of these reactive radicals 3 2 1 the roles of rns in prp and amp degradation in uv chloramine treatment firstly to explore the reactivity of rns including nh2 nh2o2 with prp and amp in uv chloramine treatment we carried out the verification tests in uv h2o2 system at appropriate concentration of ammonia 0 5 mm and ph 10 0 and 7 0 using 10 mm phosphate buffer as shown in fig s4 the kobs of prp and amp was decreased apparently when the concentration of nh3 was 0 5 mm at ph 10 0 the ammonia radicals can be produced from fast reaction of ho and ammonia in aqueous solution by reaction eq 6 neta et al 1978 6 nh3 ho nh2 h2o k1 1 0 108 m 1 s 1 7 nh 2 o2 nh2o 2 k2 109 m 1 s 1 when the ph was at 10 0 the concentration of nh2 maintained a high level according to the eq 6 meanwhile a part of nh2 might reacted with the trace of dissolved oxygen in aqueous solution eq 7 the apparent decreasing suggested that nh2 and other rns exhibited low reactivity with prp and amp however the k obs of these two micro contaminants were almost not changed when the ph was at 7 0 the main species of ammonia was nh4 pka 9 7 at ph 7 0 which reacted with ho at much lower rate constant neta et al 1978 thus the nh4 of higher concentration did not quench ho yielding nh2 actually nh2 was expected to be unreactive towards organic compounds in other previous studies for example diethyltoluamide which has the similar structure to prp and amp could hardly be oxidized by nh2 in uv chloramine treatment zhang et al 2016 suggesting that primary amines and aromatics have limited reactivity with nh2 therefore the rate constants of prp and amp degradation in uv chloramine treatment could be further simplified as follows 8 kobs s kuv kho ho ss krcs rcs ss 3 2 2 the roles of ho and rcs to prp and amp degradation in uv chloramine treatment the tbuoh as the typical ho and cl scavenger reacts rapidly with ho and cl with the rate constants of 5 91 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 and 1 90 108 m 1s 1 gilbert et al 1988 respectively while the rate constant of reaction between tbuoh and cl2 was relatively low i e 7 102 m 1s 1 hasegawa and neta 1978 as shown in fig 1 k obs of prp and amp degradation decreased by 51 9 and 47 5 respectively with 10 mm tbuoh addition termed as uv chloramine tbuoh the obvious inhibition of k obs primarily suggested ho and cl played a dominant role in prp and amp degradation the discrepancies between the k obs of uv chloramine tbuoh and uv alone indicated that other reactive species such as cl2 and clo in uv chloramine treatment might also contribute to their degradation which were discussed as follows 3 2 2 1 ho radicals the contribution of ho to prp and amp degradation could be obtained by kho prp kho amp and kho ho ss firstly kho prp and kho amp were measured to be 5 43 0 12 109 m 1 s 1 for prp and 1 69 0 18 1010 m 1 s 1 for amp respectively by the competitive method using ba and nb as competitive compounds in uv h2o2 treatment the details were shown in text s6 secondly the ho ss was obtained by the depletion of a ho probe i e nb in uv chloramine treatment as expressed by eq 9 nb had a relatively low reactivity with other oxidants e g chloramine and rcs and was inert to uv photolysis in uv chloramine treatment thus the degradation of nb was mainly ascribed to ho oxidation fang et al 2014 watts and linden 2007 xiang et al 2016 9 l n n b t n b 0 k h o n b h o s s t where kho nb was the second order rate constant of nb which has been measured to be 3 90 109 m 1 s 1 in previous study buxton et al 1988 it was noted that the effects of the trace amount of nb on prp amp degradation in uv chloramine treatment could be negligible as the k obs of prp and amp with addition of trace nb were only 3 2 and 2 8 less than that of prp and amp without addition of nb as calculated the ho ss during prp and amp degradation by uv chloramine were obtained to be 6 52 10 14 m and 9 82 10 14 m respectively text s7 then the kho ho ss were calculated to be 0 0212 min 1 and 0 0995 min 1 for prp and amp which accounted for 35 7 and 36 0 of total k obs 3 2 2 2 rcs radicals the contribution of rcs to prp and amp degradation could be evaluated via eq 10 as follows 10 r rcs r r ho r uv where r was the overall removal rate of prp and amp in uv chloramine treatment rrcs rho and ruv represented the pseudo first order rate constants of prp and amp degradation by rcs ho and uv irradiation respectively according to the results above rrcs could be calculated to be 0 0243 min 1 and 0 0536 min 1 for prp and amp which accounted for 40 9 and 19 4 of total kobs based on the obtained tbuoh scavenging results and ho contribution the contributions of cl for prp and amp were calculated by subtracting rho from rho cl calculated by subtracting kobs of uv chloramine tbuoh from total kobs which accounted for 16 2 and 11 5 of total kobs respectively then the total contributions of other rcs such as cl2 and clo were calculated to be 24 7 and 7 9 for prp and amp respectively 3 3 effects of ph chloramine dosages and background anions on prp and amp degradation in uv chloramine treatment 3 3 1 effects of ph on the contributions of the active free radicals in uv chloramine treatment as shown in fig 2 the overall degradation rates of prp and amp gradually decreased with the increase of ph furthermore the contributions of uv photolysis radical oxidation by ho and rcs to prp and amp degradation at different ph were determined firstly the photolysis rates of prp and amp were not affected at the experimental ph range i e 6 5 10 0 where the uv absorption wavelength of prp and amp was not changed jia et al 2018 however k obs contributed by free radicals decreased from 0 0490 min 1 to 0 0128 min 1 for prp and from 0 1840 min 1 to 0 0970 min 1 for amp with ph increasing from 6 5 to 10 0 these phenomena could be attributed to the following reasons on the one hand nh2cl maintained at a higher concentration level and was more stable at ph 8 5 as mentioned in the previous literature bu et al 2018 when 6 5 ph 8 5 a small percentage of nh2cl was converted into dichloramine nhcl2 and hocl as eqs 11 and 12 the higher quantum yield of nhcl2 and hocl i e 0 82 0 08 mol einstain 1 and 1 0 0 1 mol einstain 1 respectively than that of nh2cl i e 0 50 0 04 mol einstain 1 increased the total free radical formation rate at lower ph laat et al 2010 feng et al 2007 on the other hand phosphate buffer exists mainly as the specie of hpo4 2 pka 7 2 in basic condition which scavenges ho faster than h2po4 the main species at ph 6 5 and 7 0 eqs 13 and 14 wu et al 2019 therefore the steady state concentrations of oh decreased at higher ph 8 5 10 0 conditions 11 2nh2cl h nh4 nhcl2 12 nhcl2 h2o hocl nh2cl 13 ho hpo4 2 hpo4 oh k11 1 5 105 m 1 s 1 14 ho h2po4 hpo4 h2o k12 2 0 104 m 1 s 1 furthermore for the pyrazolone degradation by radicals oxidation the relative contributions of ho and rcs were discussed as the ratio of k obs ho k obs rcs shown in table s6 at ph 6 5 and ph 7 the ratio of k obs ho k obs rcs for prp was 0 74 and 0 89 suggesting that rcs contributed more than ho to prp degradation with the increase of ph the ratio of k obs ho k obs rcs increased to 1 61 indicating ho primarily contributed to prp degradation at alkaline condition the overall increasing contribution of ho was attributed to that ph affected the transformation of cl into ho via cloh and accelerated the transformation of cl to ho with ph increasing fang et al 2014 for amp the ratio of k obs ho k obs rcs was greater than 1 at all ph and increased from 1 10 to 1 70 as ph increasing from 6 5 to 10 0 indicating that ho was always the predominant contributor to amp degradation the higher contribution of ho might be owing to the high activity of tertiary amine group of amp the previous study had reported that ho was inclined to attack the tertiary amine group of amp directly by demethylation miao et al 2015b 3 3 2 effects of chloramine dosages on prp and amp degradation in uv chloramine treatment fig 3 showed the k obs of prp and amp during uv chloramine treatment under different chloramine dosages i e 0 01 1 0 mm as the chloramine dosage increased from 0 01 mm to 0 2 mm the corresponding k obs of prp and amp increased gradually from 0 0415 min 1 and 0 197 min 1 to 0 0570 min 1 and 0 271 min 1 respectively with further increased chloramine dosage to 1 0 mm the k obs increased slightly and reached a plateau the augment of observed synergistic degradation rates for prp and amp might stem from more generation of rcs and ho with the increase of nh2cl dosage however as the radicals scavenger nh2cl might react with cl and ho yielding inert reactive radicals such as nhcl a low oxidicability free radical eqs 15 and 16 which weakened the enhancement of radical oxidation to prp and amp degradation li et al 2018 15 cl nh2cl nhcl h cl k13 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 16 ho nh2cl nhcl h2o k14 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 3 3 3 effects of background matrices in natural water on prp and amp degradation in uv chloramine treatment the common present background matrices such as hco3 cl and srnom may affect pyrazolone degradation during uv chloramine treatment fig 4 showed the effects of different concentrations of hco3 1 10 mm cl 1 10 mm and srnom 5 10 mg l on the degradation of prp and amp during uv chloramine treatment effect of hco 3 for prp 1 5 mm hco3 could slightly decrease the k obs prp from 0 0594 min 1 to 0 0534 min 1 for amp the k obs amp decreased slightly from 0 2761 min 1 to 0 2265 min 1 the existence of hco3 in uv chloramine consumed the radicals with the high second order rates eqs 17 19 bu et al 2018 the main product of the reactions was carbonate radicals co3 which was a lower oxidation potential radical and selectively oxidized contaminants zhang et al 2015 the previous studies had reported that co3 could react with amines i e aniline the uracil functional compounds and 4 methyaniline with 1 4 9 1 108 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 similarly co3 is possibly to react with prp and amp with lower rate constants compared with ho and rcs thus the overall degradation rates of prp and amp in uv chloramine treatment always decreased when hco3 existed 17 cl hco3 co3 h cl k15 2 2 108 m 1 s 1 18 ho hco3 co3 h2o k16 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 19 cl2 hco3 co3 h 2cl k17 8 0 107 m 1 s 1 effect of cl as the concentration of cl increased gradually from 0 to 1 mm the k obs prp increased and then gradually decreased with further increasing cl to 10 mm as shown in fig 4a cl could react rapidly with ho yielding cloh which could be reversibly transformed into ho with the same generation rate of cloh under the neutral basic conditions xiao et al 2016 thus the reaction of cl with ho could be negligible however cl also reacts rapidly with cl to produce cl2 fang et al 2014 the generation of cl2 in the presence of 1 mm cl enhanced the degradation of prp which agreed with the result that prp could be removed by cl2 as discussed in section 3 2 2 however higher concentration of cl caused the radical self scavenging reactions of cl2 with cl2 cl with cl2 i e eqs 20 and 21 hence when the concentration of cl increased to 10 mm the k obs prp slightly reduced from 0 2761 min 1 to 0 2241 min 1 for amp as shown in fig 4b the k obs amp gradually decreased in the cl presence of 1 10 mm suggesting lower oxidation of amp by cl2 which was in consistent with the above speculation i e amp could be primarily degraded by uv irradiation and ho section 3 2 2 20 cl cl2 cl2 cl k19 2 1 109 m 1 s 1 21 cl2 cl2 cl2 2cl k20 9 0 108 m 1 s 1 effect of srnom as shown in fig 4 k obs prp gradually reduced from 0 0594 min 1 to 0 0345 min 1 fig 4a while k obs amp decreased from 0 2761 min 1 to 0 1324 min 1 fig 4b with the srnom concentration increasing from 0 to 10 mg c l 1 meanwhile with addition of 10 mg c l 1 srnom only 27 1 of prp and 65 4 of amp were removed in uv chloramine treatment after reaction time of 30 min in general srnom acted as scavenger of radicals e g cl and ho eqs 22 and 23 and uv absorption shielding the shielding factor were given in text s4 leading to the reduction of steady state concentrations of ho and rcs cl nom products k18 1 3 104 mg l 1 s 1 22 ho nom products k19 2 5 104 mg l 1 s 1 23 in real waters the degradation efficiencies of prp and amp in real waters including two surface waters and a sewage plant biological effluent were further investigated and the results were shown in fig s7 compared to that in pure water the k obs of prp and amp in these three real waters were slightly declined 3 0 12 9 8 19 respectively this might be ascribed to the quenching effect of reactive radicals by water matrices such as hco3 cl and dissolved organic matters doms and the uv absorption shielding by doms the relative higher decrease of k obs amp than k obs prp in real waters might be due to the lower oxidation of amp by cl2 formed in the presence of cl 110 195 mg l 3 10 5 50 mm in real waters as given in table s2 which was discussed above 3 4 degradation mechanism of prp and amp in uv chloramine treatment 3 4 1 prediction of reaction sites by quantum chemical computation to evaluate the preferential reaction sites the frontier molecular orbitals fmo of prp and amp were calculated fig 5 it was illustrated that the electrophilic reactions of free radicals tended to take place at the electron rich regions of homo but the nucleophilic reaction more readily occurred in the regions of lumo frisch et al 2009 it could be preliminarily given that the main active sites of prp and amp were c h at para benzene ring c n and cc furthermore the specific tertiary amine group of amp was more reactive than isopropyl of prp because of its higher electronic cloud density additionally the evaluated values of feds 2fed2 homo and fed2 homo fed2 lumo which can characterize the potential of the reactive sites for electron transfer were calculated based on the optimized structure in table s7 and fig s8 lu and chen 2012 for these two drugs the relatively high 2fed2 homo values of the contrapuntal c in benzene 6c co 9c and the c contacted with the pyrazole ring 3c meant the easier electron transfer by oh or rcs radicals specifically the 2fed2 homo and fed2 homo fed2 lumo values of 14c in isopropyl for prp were 1 71 10 7 and 1 36 10 6 table s7 respectively meanwhile compared with isopropyl 14c of prp the 14n of the tertiary amine group of amp possessed the higher value of feds to be 3 64 10 4 and 1 82 10 4 respectively which indicated the higher reactivity with active radicals 3 4 2 degradation pathway of prp and amp in uv chloramine treatment the degradation intermediates and products were monitored by lc ms ms analysis during uv chloramine treatment nine intermediates of prp and ten intermediates of amp table s8 were detected and the isomers were distinguished by their different retention times based on the reactive sites proposed by the theoretical calculation pathways and mechanism of prp and amp degradation in uv chloramine treatment were proposed as given in fig 6 to be noted that the degradation pathways of other chlorine related disinfection methods cl2 and clo2 obtained from our previous studies jia et al 2018 cai et al 2014 were compared to explore the degradation mechanism of pyrazolone drugs under different disinfection treatments as shown in fig 6 a prp was degraded by four routes i chlorine substitution route i was observed in the para position of benzene ring to form p3 by rcs rcs attacked prp by electrophilic substitution as mentioned in other aromatic hydrocarbons such as ibuprofen xiang et al 2016 this could also be proved by higher fed value of 6c fig s8 as calculated in text s6 ii furthermore the hydroxylation route ii reaction by ho mainly occurred on the benzene ring and the methyl group connected with the cc to yield p1 and p2 respectively then p1 could be further oxidized to form alcohols p5 and aldehydes p6 p7 and p2 was oxidized to form p4 with demethylation on 2n position besides the generation of p7 might be attributed to the uv photolysis iii decarbonylation occurred in pyrazole ring route iii firstly the cc of prp was split into two carbonyl groups by ho and rcs attacking and the ring opening reaction of pyrazole ring occurred to form p the predicted product presumably as isopropyl is a weak electron donating group the electron donating effect increased the electron density of the cc making it easier to be attacked by active radicals after that the decarbonylation could form p8 by ho and rcs attacking the exposed c n meanwhile the uv irradiation made the cc more active and accelerated the decarbonylation above jia et al 2018 iv dephenylization route iv was the pyrazole ring broken from benzene ring to form p9 which was the subordinate pathway for prp degradation mainly by uv irradiation and free radical oxidation fig 6 b showed the amp degradation pathway during uv chloramine treatment i the hydroxylation reaction by ho occurred on different sites to form p6 p8 and p9 then p6 was further converted into aldehydes p7 the products analysis results showed that the hydroxylation reaction mainly occurred on the benzene ring and the methyl group attached to cc ii demethylation occurred in tertiary amines of amp to form p1 which converted to p2 and alcohol p4 as mentioned above the tertiary amines attached to position 4c of amp pyrazole ring was a strong electron donating group the single electron on 6n can form a p π conjugate system with cc and further generate the electron donating conjugate effect the activity of tertiary amine group made the demethylation route ii to be the dominant reaction pathway of amp degradation by the oxidation of ho meanwhile previous studies showed that tertiary amine as the most common h donor was easier to react with ho via electron transformation under uv irradiation davidson 1996 iii decarbonylation the open loop reaction of cc by ho and rcs attacking occurred similarly with prp degradation to generate p3 and p5 iv dephenylization was also the main pathway for amp to form p10 compared to cl2 and clo2 treatment the degradation pathway and mechanism in uv chloramine treatment were more complicated previous study showed that cl2 disinfection reactions of prp and amp were mainly hydroxylation and chlorine substitution while clo2 reactions of prp and amp were mainly deacetylation the degradation pathways of prp and amp in cl2 and clo2 disinfection treatment were almost contained in uv chloramine treatment therein dephenylization specifically occurred in uv chloramine treatment because of uv irradiation and free radicals oxidation specially demethylation reaction in tertiary amine group of amp only happened in uv chloramine treatment which was attributed to the oxidation by ho enhancing amp degradation partly miao et al 2015b the more complex degradation mechanism for prp and amp in uv chloramine treatment was owing to the higher oxidic ability and non selectivity of free radicals compared to cl2 and clo2 3 5 genetic toxicity variation of prp and amp during uv chloramine treatment in order to explore the dosage effects on the toxicity different concentrations of pyrazolone 0 1 and 0 5 mm and chloramine 0 1 0 5 and 1 0 mm were added to the reaction system the negative control without pyrazolone and chloramine was exposed to milli q water to obtain the mutagenicity of background the indicators of genetic toxicity were represented with micronucleus frequency mcn and micronucleus index mci which followed the eqs 22 and 23 and the results were given in table 1 mci indicated the relative toxicity of experimental group and the significant mutagenicity could be identified when the values of mci were greater than 1 5 khadra et al 2012 the influence of the residual na2s2o3 was found to be negligible in the toxicity experiments based on the similar mcn values mcn 1 90 with negative groups mcn 1 86 22 mcn number of micronucleys cells numble of total cells 1000 23 mci mcn of experimental group mcn of negative control group mci of blank control groups i e prp amp 0 0 1 or 0 5 mm nh2cl 0 0 mm exhibited the background toxicity level of prp or amp contaminated water and the values of mci ranged from 8 91 to 15 34 which were higher than negative control i e 1 00 p 0 01 these results indicated that the toxicity of prp and amp significantly affected the water quality after uv chloramine disinfection the maximum toxicities of prp and amp decreased by 9 7 and 19 3 which indicated uv chloramine disinfection could partly reduce the toxicity of water containing pyrazolone compared with rpr the higher reduction extent of amp might be ascribed to the more complete degradation of amp based on the above kinetic results and products analysis meanwhile the total organic carbon toc concentrations in the reaction system after uv chloramine treatment decreased by 4 and 8 for prp and amp respectively these results suggested that uv chloramine disinfection could reduce pyrazolone contaminated water toxicity to some extent 4 conclusion participation of uv can significantly enhance the capacity of chloramine to remove prp and amp the degradation of prp and amp in uv chloramine treatment followed pseudo first order kinetics and the rate constants were 0 0594 min 1 and 0 2761 min 1 respectively in uv chloramine treatment ho and rcs contributed 35 7 and 40 9 for prp degradation while 36 0 and 19 4 for amp degradation the k obs of prp and amp decreased with increasing ph from 6 5 to 10 0 and increased nonlinearly with increasing chloramine dosage it was observed that low concentration of cl i e 1 mm could enhance prp degradation due to the generation of cl2 which exhibited higher reactivity with prp however 1 10 mm hco3 and 5 10 mg l nom inhibited prp and amp degradation based on the theoretical calculation and products analysis the degradation products of prp and amp were similarly produced from the reaction of hydroxylation demethylation deacetylation and dephenylization while the reaction of chlorine substitution was only occurred in prp degradation interestingly the susceptible reaction of amp with ho due to the electron rich properties of the specific tertiary amine group enhanced the degradability of amp the genetic toxicities of prp and amp were observed to be partially reduced by uv chloramine treatment notably compared to cl2 and clo2 disinfection the prp and amp degradation were more complete in uv chloramine treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have
