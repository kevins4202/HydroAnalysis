22865,supercavitating vehicle is almost surrounded by a cavity and therefore reaches very high speed and large range due to the significant reduction in skin friction drag configuration optimization contributes to further improve speed and range for the vehicle in the few previous works natural supercavitating vehicle has been focused to optimize its configuration in terms of overall dimensions mass distribution and control surface ventilation is also taken into account and determined in the optimization process here the configuration optimizations for natural and ventilated supercavitating vehicles are comparatively investigated and the results show that the optimal value of the cavitator radius is smaller for the ventilated supercavity which results in smaller cavitator drag higher vehicle speed and consequently higher range keywords supercavitating vehicle ventilation rate configuration optimization 1 introduction supercavitating vehicles are high speed underwater vehicles almost surrounded by a cavity only a small portion of the vehicle in the nose and the tail is in contact with water which results in significant reduction of skin friction drag mirzaei et al 2016 supercavitation can be created and maintained either naturally or artificially a natural supercavity can be formed when the speed of underwater vehicle is very high which leads to vaporization of the water near the body surface kawakami and arndt 2011 however artificial or ventilated supercavities are used when such a high speed cannot be attained and the supercavity is formed by injecting gas into the flow separation region around cavitator guo et al 2010 experimental results of supercavitation in water tunnels show that as the ventilation rate increases at a constant froude number the cavitation number decreases and reaches a minimum value ahn et al 2017 the clear supercavity appears at this minimum cavitation number which can maintain the cavity shape even if the ventilation rate decreases a little this means that the amount of ventilation rate to sustain a supercavity is less than the amount of ventilation rate to generate it karn et al 2016 the minimum cavitation number at which supercavity usually remains stable is selected as the final design cavitation number in the present optimization design configuration optimization is necessary for high speed underwater vehicles to have maximum range and speed there exist different methods for configuration optimization of supercavitating vehicles in the simplest method the optimization problem consists of maximizing or minimizing a real function namely the range of the vehicle ahn et al 2010 or drag force choi et al 2005 by systematically choosing input values from within an allowed set and computing the value of the function other nonlinear optimization methods such as the genetic algorithm can be used for optimizing the shape of supercavitating vehicles jiang et al 2009 ahn et al 2010 studied configuration optimization of natural supercavitating vehicles in terms of overall dimensions mass distribution and control surface size also some specific requirements related to the operation of the vehicle at the trim condition and during maneuvers have been considered in their optimization process the objective function in their optimization problem is the range of vehicle which is maximized alyanak et al 2006 performed a multi disciplinary structure optimization for the vehicle the analyses of static strength dynamic and buckling are studied and the optimal configuration of the stiffeners stiffener dimensions and the shell thickness of the vehicle are determined the objective function in their work is the mass of vehicle for each design case alyanak et al 2006 studied the design of an optimum supercavitating vehicle in another work and the overall size shape and structural configuration of the vehicle are considered by them and the optimal configuration of stiffeners in the vehicle structure is determined they introduced an objective function in their optimization process which consists of the drag force and the cavity volume in other words the drag force should be minimized and the cavity volume should be maximized simultaneously to decrease the thrust needed and also the vehicle to be surrounded completely by the cavity respectively sweger and kamada 2004 have studied an optimization process for high speed underwater vehicles which finds the optimal trim configuration with minimal control effort global design parameters such as fins geometry and cavitator diameter and also the angular position of the vehicle with respect to the direction of motion are considered as optimization variables two goals namely minimizing the propulsion and requiring minimum control effort are considered in their work as objective functions of the optimization problem also choi et al shafaghat et al 2011 have studied optimization of the cavitator shape of a supercavitating vehicle in order to minimize the drag force and therefore minimizing the propulsion and the shape of the supercavity is also determined for different cavitators in the present work a novel optimization problem is presented for supercavitating vehicles the ventilation is taken into account and the required ventilation rate is determined in the optimization process first the mathematical modeling of the vehicle in the steady state flight is presented and then the optimization algorithm is applied to configuration optimization for natural and ventilated supercavitating vehicle with comparative analyses 2 optimization model supercavitating vehicle in steady level flight is focused in fig 1 as can be seen in the figure the xoz frame is the inertial coordinate system and the xoz frame is the body reference frame which is positioned on the vehicle and is defined to be located at the center of gravity of vehicle cg the x axis of the vehicle assumed to be oriented forward and along the vehicle axis of symmetry and the z axis is perpendicular to the x axis and oriented downward symbols u and w denote the forward and vertical velocities of the vehicle in the body fixed reference frame respectively also the vehicle is allowed to rotate about an axis which completes the right handed body fixed reference frame the magnitude of the rotation is denoted by θ which is defined as the pitch angle of the vehicle the total length of the vehicle is l and the distance of the cavitator from the cg is denoted by x c the deflection angle of the cavitator is denoted by δ c and has a positive sign when the cavitator force is along the positive z axis also the fin deflection angle is denoted by δ f and has a positive sign when the fin force f f i n z is along the negative z axis for planing conditions of a supercavitating vehicle in steady state conditions the equilibrium equations of forces in the inertial coordinate system and the equation of moment in the body coordinate system are written as follows mirzaei et al 2016 semenenko and naumovanesteruk 2012 1 f x f p z sin θ t cos θ f f i n z sin θ f n x cos θ f n z si n θ 0 2 f z t sin θ m g f p z cos θ f f i

f f i n z is the normal fin force the supercavity shape determines the wetted area of the body for hydrodynamics forces the savchenko empirical model is used for calculation of cavity radius r c in the present study which is written as follow vlasenko 2003 4 r c 1 3 x 1 3 i f x 2 0 r c 2 3 659 0 847 x 2 0 0 236 σ x 2 0 2 i f x 2 0 where x x r n is the dimensionless distance from the cavitator and r c r c r n is the dimensionless radius of cavity and r n is the cavitator radius the normal fin force which is modeled based on the work of dzielski and kurdila 2003 and is expressed as the following equations 5 f f i n z 1 2 ρ v 2 a f c l f α f 6 α f tan 1 w v δ f where ρ is the density of water v is the velocity magnitude a f is the fin area and α f is the fin angle of attack the coefficient c l f n c d 0 1 σ a n a f represents the resulting lift coefficient due to the fin deflection δ f where n 0 5 represents the effectiveness of the elevators relative to the cavitator effectiveness dzielski and kurdila 2003 c d 0 represents the drag coefficient of cavitator at zero cavitation number which is considered equal to 0 815 for a disk cavitator σ is the cavitation number and a n is the frontal area of cavitator it should be noted that the axial component of fin force has been neglected in the calculations because unlike the cavitator drag the axial component of the fin force is small relative to the normal fin force dzielski 2011 however see reference sanabria et al 2015 for more accurate calculations of the fin force the components of cavitator force in body coordinate system are written as follows and are shown in fig 2 mirzaei et al 2016 semenenko and naumovanesteruk 2012 7 f n x f x 0 c o s α δ c c o s δ c 8 f n z f x 0 c o s α δ c s i n δ c where α tan 1 w v is the angle of attack of the vehicle δ c is the deflection angle of the cavitator and f x 0 1 2 ρ v 2 π r n 2 c d 0 1 σ in order to represent the planing force and moment the paryshev s model has been used the centerline of real cavities is affected by the cavity buoyancy and the cavitator force which are not included in formulas of planing force due to their insignificant effect for ventilated supervaitating vehicles dzielski 2011 in addition the memory effect for the cavity shape is not discussed in the planing force modeling li et al 2014 the paryshev s formula for the planing force is manipulated and simplified by dzielski which is written as follows dzielski 2011 9 f p z α i m π ρ r 2 h 2 r c r h tan α i m w t π ρ r 2 h 2 r c r h r c r h 2 tan α i m w t 2 10 m p α i m f p z α i m l x c where r is the radius of the vehicle and w t w l x c q is the transom velocity it should be noted that the component of the planing force in the x direction is neglected in the present study because of its relatively small value the immersion depth h and the immersion angle α i m are defined as mirzaei et al 2016 dzielski and kurdila 2003 11 h 0 w v r c r l l w v r c r w v r c r l 12 α i m w v r c v w 0 w v r c v w 0 in above equations r c is the expansion rate of cavity radius at the tail section x l which can be obtained by differentiating the cavity radius formula eq 4 with respect to x and multiplication by v dzielski and kurdila 2003 dzielski 2011 the next step is to model the ventilation effect for supercavitating vehicles as discussed earlier there are two main mechanisms of gas leakage from ventilated supercavities namely the portion gas leakage toroidal vortices and the twin vortex gas leakage spurk 2002 suggested the following model for the gas leakage of toroidal vortices using the dimensional analysis method and showed that the model s predictions are in good agreement with experimental data under very high fr conditions and for reentrant jets 13 c q k q 1 σ σ 1 σ l n 1 σ in the above equation c q is the ventilation coefficient defined as q v d n 2 where q is the volume flow rate of the injected gas and d n is the cavitator diameter also k q is an empirical coefficient which is a function of reynolds number zou et al 2017a cox and clayden calculated the gas leakage of the vortex tube mechanism for the first time cox and clayden 1955 the semi empirical formula by epshtein which is an extension of the cox clayden formula is more reliable and more widely accepted epshtein 1970 14 c q 0 42 c d 0 2 σ σ 3 f r 4 2 5 c d 0 where f r is the froude number based on the cavitator diameter for experiments performed in water tunnels the blockage effect of tunnel walls can affect the shape of the supercavity the blockage ratio b is defined as the ratio of tunnel equivalent diameter to the diameter of the cavitator by increasing the blockage ratio b the effect of walls becomes less important and the blockage cavitation number tends to zero zou et al 2013 showed that the blockage cavitation number is about 0 0018 for blockage ratio of 55 and for such conditions the effect of walls can be ignored they also presented a formula based on numerical studies for calculation of this minimum cavitation number and showed that the results are in a very good agreement with experimental data the minimum cavitation number based on their work is a function of froude number and blockage ratio as follows zou et al 2013 15 σ m 2 5 c d 0 1 3 c 1 f r 4 3 c 2 where the coefficients c 1 and c 2 are functions of the blockage ratio b and define as 16 c 1 1 472 b 0 3755 17 c 2 3 885 b 1 276 it is also emphasized that the minimum cavitation number in unbounded field is also constrained by natural cavitation number in the state of high speed or natural supercavitation flows this is a very complicated mechanism problem and needs further study see reference zou et al 2017b for more details the calculated value of eq 15 is taken as the final design cavitation number the objective function in the optimization problem is the range of the vehicle in the trimmed flight which should be maximized the range can be determined in different ways the breguet range equation veresnikov et al 2017 asselin 1997 fleeman 2006 is used for this purpose which assumes that during the flight with constant speed the ratio of lift to drag remains unchanged if the vehicle is in the steady state level flight by considering the force balance equations the ratio of lift to drag will be equal to f l f d m g t the range of the vehicle is calculated using the following relation thomson 1986 hill and peterson 1965 18 r a n g e i 0 v m t where 19 i 0 i s p g ln 1 1 r m p in above equations m is the mass of the vehicle and r m p is the ratio of propellant to vehicle weights and all of these three parameters are considered from the initial flight values the momentum equation for the thrust force is written as t m p v e q where m p is the propulsive mass flow rate it should be noted that i 0 is a characteristic of the engine and that the presented range equation does not consider the distance traveled by the vehicle until it reaches the trimmed flight the specific impulse is defined as i s p v e q g which assumes that the equivalent exhaust velocity v e q remains unchanged during the motion the specific impulse represents the performance of the combustion system and is defined as the total impulse on the propulsion system divided by the total weight of exhausted propellant during the operation of the engine 3 optimization method the direct search or pattern search method has been used for the optimization problem the pattern search method uses the augmented lagrangian pattern search alps algorithm to solve nonlinear constraint problems the optimization problem is kolda et al 2006 20 min f d v such that 21 c i d v 0 i 1 2 m 22 c e q i d v 0 i m 1 m t 23 a d v b 24 a e q d v b e q 25 l b d v u b in the above equations d v are design variables and f d v is the objective function which should be minimized c i d v represents the nonlinear inequality constraints c e q i d v represents the equality constraints m is the number of inequality constraints and m t is the total number of nonlinear equality constraints also eq 23 and eq 24 show the linear inequality constraints and linear equality constraints respectively finally eq 25 defines a set of lower and upper bounds l b and u b on the design variables so that the solution is always in the range l b d v u b therefore the pattern search algorithm attempts to solve a nonlinear optimization problem with linear or nonlinear constraints and bounds a subproblem is formulated by combining the objective function and nonlinear constraint function using the lagrangian and penalty parameters a sequence of such optimization problems is approximately minimized using a pattern search algorithm such that the linear constraints and bounds are satisfied each subproblem solution represents one iteration the number of function evaluations per iteration is therefore much higher using nonlinear constraints than otherwise a subproblem formulation is defined as kolda et al 2006 26 θ d v λ s ρ f d v i 1 m λ i s i l o g s i c i d v i m 1 m t λ i c e q i d v ρ 2 i m 1 m t c e q i d v 2 where components λ i are nonnegative lagrange multiplier estimates elements s i are nonnegative shifts and ρ is the positive penalty parameter the algorithm begins by using an initial value for the penalty parameter initial penalty and the pattern search minimizes a sequence of subproblems each subproblem has a fixed value of λ s and ρ when the subproblem is minimized to a required accuracy and satisfies feasibility conditions the lagrangian estimates are updated otherwise the penalty parameter is increased by a penalty factor these steps are repeated until the stopping criteria are met in this method the derivatives or approximation of derivatives are not been used for solving the problem and only the function values are used torczon 1995 for example if a function f d v is to be minimized where d v r n and f r n r the general pattern search algorithm can be represented as fig 3 in fig 3 δ i and p i are the step and the pattern respectively in the pattern search method only the simple decrease of the objective function is required and as mentioned this method doesn t need any information about derivatives and classical sufficient decrease conditions torczon 1995 step s i is determined using exploratory moves δ i p i more information about the pattern search method and also the theory of convergence of this process can be found in torczon 1995 torczon 1997 the objective function in the optimization problem is the range of vehicle which should be maximized also three constraints related to the cavity radius and immersion depth must be justified which are 1 the cavity radius in the aft region must be greater than the vehicle radius 2 the immersion depth in the aft region must be positive 3 the immersion depth in the aft region must be less than 30 of vehicle radius in this region the first constraint shows that the vehicle must be surrounded completely by the cavity to avoid partial cavitation the second constraint represents that the immersion depth must be positive while planing occurs and the third constraint shows that the immersion depth should be small enough to permit using the planing force relations therefore the optimization problem and its three constraints can be represented in summary as follows 27 f d v r a n g e d v 28 c 1 r r c x l 0 29 c 2 h x l 0 30 c 3 h 0 3 r x l 0 where f d v in eq 27 is equal to the negative value of vehicle range r a n g e d v that is a function of different design variables d v as the range of the vehicle should be maximized in the optimization process f d v should be minimized also c 1 to c 3 in eqs 28 30 represent three mentioned constraints the cavitator radius r n and the vehicle speed v are considered as design variables which are unknown and the optimum values of these variables are obtained to reach the optimum of the objective function maximum range also the pitch angle θ the cavitator deflection angle δ c and the fin deflection angle δ f are determined for the equilibrium of the vehicle therefore in addition to three aforementioned constraints three constraints c 4 to c 6 relate to force and moment equilibrium equations should be established these three constraints are represented in this way that instead of the precise establishment of equilibrium equations the following relations can be used with an acceptable approximation 31 c 4 f p z sin θ t cos θ f f i n z sin θ f n x cos θ f n z si n θ 0 01 t 32 c 5 t sin θ m g f p z cos θ f f i n z cos θ f n x sin θ f n z cos θ 0 01 m g 33 c 6 f n z x c f p z l x c f f i n z l x c 0 01 f n z x c the reason to relax trim flight constraints to 1 as inequality constraints instead of precise equality constraints is that the number of iterations to reach convergence and also the total time of optimization will significantly decrease without obvious changes in the final results of optimization finally we have an optimization problem which minimize an objective function eq 27 based on six nonlinear inequality constraints eqs 28 33 and no nonlinear equality constraints or linear constraints the lower and upper bounds for design variables as in eq 25 are presented in the next section two different optimization problems have been considered here the first optimization problem is for a natural supercavitating vehicle and the second one is for a ventilated supercavitating vehicle it should be noted that the main difference between the optimization problems is considering the ventilation coefficient relations in the second optimization process also the other difference between two optimizations is the method of calculation of cavitation number the cavitation number for a natural supercavity can be determined by setting the cavity pressure equal to the vapor pressure of water however in the second optimization problem considering the ventilation effects the cavitation number is calculated using the minimum cavitation number discussed in section 2 see eq 15 in addition for a ventilated supercavity the cavity inside pressure is related to the rate at which the gas is injected to the supercavity in this case the mechanism of gas leakage from the supercavity can be the portion gas leakage or the twin vortex gas leakage and the ventilation coefficients for these two mechanisms of gas leakage can be determined using eq 13 and eq 14 respectively it should be noted that the ventilation rate and the gas leakage rate are equal in the steady flows 4 results and discussion at the first step in this part an optimization problem for a high speed underwater vehicle is presented without considering the effects of ventilation the values of the parameters are taken from the work of ahn et al 2010 and are shown in table 1 in this case the cavity is proposed to be formed naturally and thus the cavity inside pressure is equal to the vapor pressure of water the pattern search optimization process has been used to minimize the objective function which is the negative value of the vehicle range the design variables which are the cavitator radius r n and the vehicle speed v and also the pitch angle θ the cavitator deflection angle δ c and the fin deflection angle δ f at the trim condition are changed in the optimization process to reach the optimum of the objective function maximum range it should be noted that limits for these variables are 76 200 m s 0 01 0 06 m 10 to 10 10 to10 and 10 to10 for v r n δ c δ f and θ respectively the trend of convergence of these variables is depicted in fig 4 and the final results of the optimization for the vehicle with the natural cavity are presented in the third column of table 2 also the evolution of three constraints is shown in fig 5 based on the results the convergence to the optimal solution is achieved after approximately 820 iterations this optimization problem for high speed underwater vehicles with natural supercavity is named the conventional optimization problem in the rest of the paper also fig 6 shows the trend of convergence of cavity shape in the optimization process as can be seen in fig 6 the cavity may be partial before reaching the optimum conditions and closes on the body however after reaching the optimum conditions the supercavity is formed which surrounds the whole vehicle the next step is to consider the ventilation effect and improve the optimization problem for this purpose the minimum cavitation number is determined using eq 15 by setting the blockage ratio equal to 55 the case of unbounded flow also the ventilation coefficient is determined using eqs 13 or 14 for the portion gas leakage or twin vortex gas leakage mechanisms based on the campbell hilborne criterion campbell and hilborne 1958 this new optimization process which considers the effect of ventilation is named modified optimization the trend of convergence of different variables is depicted in fig 7 and the final results of modified optimization problem considering ventilation effects are presented in the last column of table 2 the evolution of three constraints is also shown in fig 8 based on the results the convergence is achieved after approximately 930 iterations it should be noted that the lower and upper limits of the variables are the same as mentioned values in the previous optimization problem the trend of convergence of cavity shape in the modified optimization problem is shown in fig 9 as can be seen in fig 9 the cavity isn t partial before reaching the optimum solution according to obtained results the required ventilation rate for the optimized vehicle is equal to 0 792 m3 s based on the results of two considered optimization problems the values of the pitch angle the cavitator deflection angle and the fin deflection angle are changed to reach the trim conditions in each case also it can be seen that the optimum cavitator radius is changed from 0 05 m to 0 03 m for the conventional and modified optimization problems respectively in other words by considering the effect of ventilation a smaller cavitator can form a supercavity for the vehicle the values of cavitation number are also different in two optimization problems and are equal to 0 0387 and 0 0242 for the conventional and modified optimizations respectively this result is expected because the ventilation decreases the cavitation number by increasing the cavity inside pressure also the optimized speed is higher for the ventilated case which is another cause of lower cavitation number consequently the optimal cavity shapes are different because of different values of cavitator radius and cavitation number for two optimization problems fig 10 shows the comparison between the optimal cavity shapes for the conventional and modified optimization problems as can be seen the optimal shape of the cavity is smaller for the modified optimization problem although the cavitation number is smaller for the modified optimization problem ventilated supercavity which can create a bigger cavity the cavitator radius is also smaller for this case which results in a relatively smaller supercavity the main difference between the results of two considered optimization problems is the optimized values of the cavitator radius the optimum values of the cavitator radius are 0 05 m and 0 03 m for the conventional and modified optimization problems respectively the main effect of the cavitator radius or its area is on the drag force of cavitator based on eq 7 the smaller cavitator radius for the modified optimization problem results in a significant reduction of the drag force for the vehicle with ventilation the effect of this reduction in the drag force of the cavitator is obvious in the optimized values of vehicle speed which are equal to 90 17 m s and 149 7 m s for the optimized vehicles with natural and ventilated supercavities respectively the increase in the optimized value of the vehicle speed is about 66 from the conventional to the modified optimization problems finally the effect of the increased speed in the modified optimization problem is obvious on the optimized value of the vehicle range the final values of the vehicle range are equal to 1144 6 m and 1898 9 m for the conventional and modified optimizations respectively 5 conclusion the cavitator diameter speed and the ventilation rate required for the artificial supercavity of a high speed underwater vehicle are optimized by considering different operational requirements in the optimization problem the objective function of the optimization problem is the range of vehicle which should be maximized also the ventilation effect of ventilated supercavity has been considered in the optimization process and the required ventilation rate has been calculated two optimization problems have been presented without and with considering the effect of ventilation the results showed that the optimum value of the cavitator radius is smaller for the vehicle with ventilated supercavity which has led to the smaller drag force of cavitator higher speed of the vehicle and higher range the comparison between the cavity shapes for the conventional and modified optimization problems showed that cavity size is smaller for the case of modified optimization problem finally it was suggested that the presented novel optimization process by considering the ventilation effect is a useful tool for investigation of the optimal performance of high speed underwater vehicles in the practical cases with ventilated supercavities

and a n is the frontal area of cavitator it should be noted that the axial component of fin force has been neglected in the calculations because unlike the cavitator drag the axial component of the

model has been used the centerline of real cavities is affected by the cavity buoyancy and the cavitator force which are not included in formulas of planing force due to their insignificant effect for ventilated supervaitating vehicles dzielski 2011 in addition the memory effect for the cavity shape is not discussed in the planing force modeling li et al 2014 the paryshev s formula for the planing

respect to x and multiplication by v dzielski and kurdila 2003 dzielski 2011 the next step is to model the ventilation effect for supercavitating vehicles as discussed earlier there are two main mechanisms of gas leakage from ventilated supercavities namely the portion gas leakage toroidal vortices and the twin vortex gas leakage spurk 2002 suggested the following model for the gas leakage of toroidal vortices using the dimensional analysis method and showed that the model s predictions are in good agreement with experimental data under very high fr conditions and for reentrant jets 13 c q k q 1 σ σ 1 σ l n 1 σ in the above equation c q is the ventilation coefficient defined as q v d n 2 where q is the volume flow rate of the injected gas and d n is the cavitator diameter also k q is an empirical coefficient which is a function of reynolds number zou et al 2017a cox and clayden calculated the gas leakage of the vortex tube mechanism for the first time cox and clayden 1955 the semi empirical formula by epshtein which is an extension of the cox clayden formula is more reliable and more widely accepted epshtein 1970 14 c q 0 42 c d 0 2 σ σ 3 f r 4 2 5 c d 0 where f r is the froude number based on the cavitator diameter for experiments performed in water tunnels the blockage effect of tunnel walls can affect the shape of the supercavity the blockage ratio b is defined as the ratio of tunnel equivalent diameter to the diameter of the cavitator by increasing the blockage ratio b the effect of walls becomes less important and the blockage cavitation number tends to zero zou et al 2013 showed that the blockage cavitation number is about 0 0018 for blockage ratio of 55 and for such conditions the effect of walls can be ignored they also presented a formula based on numerical studies for calculation of this minimum cavitation number and showed that the results are in a very good agreement with experimental data the minimum cavitation number based on their work is a function of froude number and blockage ratio as follows zou et al 2013 15 σ m 2 5 c d 0 1 3 c 1 f r 4 3 c 2 where the coefficients c 1 and c 2 are functions of the blockage ratio b and define as 16 c 1 1 472 b 0 3755 17 c 2 3 885 b 1 276 it is also emphasized that the minimum cavitation number in unbounded field is also constrained by natural cavitation number in the state of high speed or natural supercavitation flows this is a very complicated mechanism problem and needs further study see reference zou et al 2017b for more details the calculated value of eq 15 is taken as the final design cavitation number the objective function in the optimization problem is the range of the vehicle in the trimmed flight which should be maximized the range can be determined in different ways the breguet range equation veresnikov et al 2017 asselin 1997 fleeman 2006 is used for this purpose which assumes that during the flight with constant speed the ratio of lift to drag remains unchanged if the vehicle is in the steady state level flight by considering the force balance equations the ratio of lift to drag will be equal to f l f d m g t the range of the vehicle is calculated using the following relation thomson 1986 hill and peterson 1965 18 r a n g e i 0 v m t where 19 i 0 i s p g ln 1 1 r m p in above equations m is the mass of the vehicle and r m p is the ratio of propellant to vehicle weights and all of these three parameters are considered from the initial flight values the momentum equation for the thrust force is written as t m p v e q where m p is the propulsive mass flow rate it should be noted that i 0 is a characteristic of the engine and that the presented range equation does not consider the distance traveled by the vehicle until it reaches the trimmed flight the specific impulse is defined as i s p v e q g which assumes that the equivalent exhaust velocity v e q remains unchanged during the motion the specific impulse represents the performance of the combustion system and is defined as the total impulse on the propulsion system divided by the total weight of exhausted propellant during the operation of the engine 3 optimization method the direct search or pattern search method has been used for the optimization problem the pattern search method uses the augmented lagrangian pattern search alps algorithm to solve nonlinear constraint problems the optimization problem is kolda et al 2006 20 min f d v such that 21 c i d v 0 i 1 2 m 22 c e q i d v 0 i m 1 m t 23 a d v b 24 a e q d v b e q 25 l b d v u b in the above equations d v are design variables and f d v is the objective function which should be minimized c i d v represents the nonlinear inequality constraints c e q i d v represents the equality constraints m is the number of inequality constraints and m t is the total number of nonlinear equality constraints also eq 23 and eq 24 show the linear inequality constraints and linear equality constraints respectively finally eq 25 defines a set of lower and upper bounds l b and u b on the design variables so that the solution is always in the range l b d v u b therefore the pattern search algorithm attempts to solve a nonlinear optimization problem with linear or nonlinear constraints and bounds a subproblem is formulated by combining the objective function and nonlinear constraint function using the lagrangian and penalty parameters a sequence of such optimization problems is approximately minimized using a pattern search algorithm such that the linear constraints and bounds are satisfied each subproblem solution represents one iteration the number of function evaluations per iteration is therefore much higher using nonlinear constraints than otherwise a subproblem formulation is defined as kolda et al 2006 26 θ d v λ s ρ f d v i 1 m λ i s i l o g s i c i d v i m 1 m t λ i c e q i d v ρ 2 i m 1 m t c e q i d v 2 where components λ i are nonnegative lagrange multiplier estimates elements s i are nonnegative shifts and ρ is the positive penalty parameter the algorithm begins by using an initial value for the penalty parameter initial penalty and the pattern search minimizes a sequence of subproblems each subproblem has a fixed value of λ s and ρ when the subproblem is minimized to a required accuracy and satisfies feasibility conditions the lagrangian estimates are updated otherwise the penalty parameter is increased by a penalty factor these steps are repeated until the stopping criteria are met in this method the derivatives or approximation of derivatives are not been used for solving the problem and only the function values are used torczon 1995 for example if a function f d v is to be minimized where d v r n and f r n r the general pattern search algorithm can be represented as fig 3 in fig 3 δ i and p i are the step and the pattern respectively in the pattern search method only the simple decrease of the objective function is required and as mentioned this method doesn t need any information about derivatives and classical sufficient decrease conditions torczon 1995 step s i is determined using exploratory moves δ i p i more information about the pattern search method and also the theory of convergence of this process can be found in torczon 1995 torczon 1997 the objective function in the optimization problem is the range of vehicle which should be maximized also three constraints related to the cavity radius and immersion depth must be justified which are 1 the cavity radius in the aft region must be greater than the vehicle radius 2 the immersion depth in the aft region must be positive 3 the immersion depth in the aft region must be less than 30 of vehicle radius in this region the first constraint shows that the vehicle must be surrounded completely by the cavity to avoid partial cavitation the second constraint represents that the immersion depth must be positive while planing occurs and the third constraint shows that the immersion depth should be small enough to permit using the planing force relations therefore the optimization problem and its three constraints can be represented in summary as follows 27 f d v r a n g e d v 28 c 1 r r c x l 0 29 c 2 h x l 0 30 c 3 h 0 3 r x l 0 where f d v in eq 27 is equal to the negative value of vehicle range r a n g e d v that is a function of different design variables d v as the range of the vehicle should be maximized in the optimization process f d v should be minimized also c 1 to c 3 in eqs 28 30 represent three mentioned constraints the cavitator radius r n and the vehicle speed v are considered as design variables which are unknown and the optimum values of these variables are obtained to reach the optimum of the objective function maximum range also the pitch angle θ the cavitator deflection angle δ c and the fin deflection angle δ f are determined for the equilibrium of the vehicle therefore in addition to three aforementioned constraints three constraints c 4 to c 6 relate to force and moment equilibrium equations should be established these three constraints are represented in this way that instead of the precise establishment of equilibrium equations the following relations can be used with an acceptable approximation 31 c 4 f p z sin θ t cos θ f f i n z sin θ f n x cos θ f n z si n θ 0 01 t 32 c 5 t sin θ m g f p z cos θ f f i n z cos θ f n x sin θ f n z cos θ 0 01 m g 33 c 6 f n z x c f p z l x c f f i n z l x c 0 01 f n z x c the reason to relax trim flight constraints to 1 as inequality constraints instead of precise equality constraints is that the number of iterations to reach convergence and also the total time of optimization will significantly decrease without obvious changes in the final results of optimization finally we have an optimization problem which minimize an objective function eq 27 based on six nonlinear inequality constraints eqs 28 33 and no nonlinear equality constraints or linear constraints the lower and upper bounds for design variables as in eq 25 are presented in the next section two different optimization problems have been considered here the first optimization problem is for a natural supercavitating vehicle and the second one is for a ventilated supercavitating vehicle it should be noted that the main difference between the optimization problems is considering the ventilation coefficient relations in the second optimization process also the other difference between two optimizations is the method of calculation of cavitation number the cavitation number for a natural supercavity can be determined by setting the cavity pressure equal to the vapor pressure of water however in the second optimization problem considering the ventilation effects the cavitation number is calculated using the minimum cavitation number discussed in section 2 see eq 15 in addition for a ventilated supercavity the cavity inside pressure is related to the rate at which the gas is injected to the supercavity in this case the mechanism of gas leakage from the supercavity can be the portion gas leakage or the twin vortex gas leakage and the ventilation coefficients for these two mechanisms of gas leakage can be determined using eq 13 and eq 14 respectively it should be noted that the ventilation rate and the gas leakage rate are equal in the steady flows 4 results and discussion at the first step in this part an optimization problem for a high speed underwater vehicle is presented without considering the effects of ventilation the values of the parameters are taken from the work of ahn et al 2010 and are shown in table 1 in this case the cavity is proposed to be formed naturally and thus the cavity inside pressure is equal to the vapor pressure of water the pattern search optimization process has been used to minimize the objective function which is the negative value of the vehicle range the design variables which are the cavitator radius r n and the vehicle speed v and also the pitch angle θ the cavitator deflection angle δ c and the fin deflection angle δ f at the trim condition are changed in the optimization process to reach the optimum of the objective function maximum range it should be noted that limits for these variables are 76 200 m s 0 01 0 06 m 10 to 10 10 to10 and 10 to10 for v r n δ c δ f and θ respectively the trend of convergence of these variables is depicted in fig 4 and the final results of the optimization for the vehicle with the natural cavity are presented in the third column of table 2 also the evolution of three constraints is shown in fig 5 based on the results the convergence to the optimal solution is achieved after approximately 820 iterations this optimization problem for high speed underwater vehicles with natural supercavity is named the conventional optimization problem in the rest of the paper also fig 6 shows the trend of convergence of cavity shape in the optimization process as can be seen in fig 6 the cavity may be partial before reaching the optimum conditions and closes on the body however after reaching the optimum conditions the supercavity is formed which surrounds the whole vehicle the next step is to consider the ventilation effect and improve the optimization problem for this purpose the minimum cavitation number is determined using eq 15 by setting the blockage ratio equal to 55 the case of unbounded flow also the ventilation coefficient is determined using eqs 13 or 14 for the portion gas leakage or twin vortex gas leakage mechanisms based on the campbell hilborne criterion campbell and hilborne 1958 this new optimization process which considers the effect of ventilation is named modified optimization the trend of convergence of different variables is depicted in fig 7 and the final results of modified optimization problem considering ventilation effects are presented in the last column of table 2 the evolution of three constraints is also shown in fig 8 based on the results the convergence is achieved after approximately 930 iterations it should be noted that the lower and upper limits of the variables are the same as mentioned values in the previous optimization problem the trend of convergence of cavity shape in the modified optimization problem is shown in fig 9 as can be seen in fig 9 the cavity isn t partial before reaching the optimum solution according to obtained results the required ventilation rate for the optimized vehicle is equal to 0 792 m3 s based on the results of two considered optimization problems the values of the pitch angle the cavitator deflection angle and the fin deflection angle are changed to reach the trim conditions in each case also it can be seen that the optimum cavitator radius is changed from 0 05 m to 0 03 m for the conventional and modified optimization problems respectively in other words by considering the effect of ventilation a smaller cavitator can form a supercavity for the vehicle the values of cavitation number are also different in two optimization problems and are equal to 0 0387 and 0 0242 for the conventional and modified optimizations respectively this result is expected because the ventilation decreases the cavitation number by increasing the cavity inside pressure also the optimized speed is higher for the ventilated case which is another cause of lower cavitation number consequently the optimal cavity shapes are different because of different values of cavitator radius and cavitation number for two optimization problems fig 10 shows the comparison between the optimal cavity shapes for the conventional and modified optimization problems as can be seen the optimal shape of the cavity is smaller for the modified optimization problem although the cavitation number is smaller for the modified optimization problem ventilated supercavity which can create a bigger cavity the cavitator radius is also smaller for this case which results in a relatively smaller supercavity the main difference between the results of two considered optimization problems is the optimized values of the cavitator radius the optimum values of the cavitator radius are 0 05 m and 0 03 m for the conventional and modified optimization problems respectively the main effect of the cavitator radius or its area is on the drag force of cavitator based on eq 7 the smaller cavitator radius for the modified optimization problem results in a significant reduction of the drag force for the vehicle with ventilation the effect of this reduction in the drag force of the cavitator is obvious in the optimized values of vehicle speed which are equal to 90 17 m s and 149 7 m s for the optimized vehicles with natural and ventilated supercavities respectively the increase in the optimized value of the vehicle speed is about 66 from the conventional to the modified optimization problems finally the effect of the increased speed in the modified optimization problem is obvious on the optimized value of the vehicle range the final values of the vehicle range are equal to 1144 6 m and 1898 9 m for the conventional and modified optimizations respectively 5 conclusion the cavitator diameter speed and the ventilation rate required for the artificial supercavity of a high speed underwater vehicle are optimized by considering different operational requirements in the optimization problem the objective function of the optimization problem is the range of vehicle which should be maximized also the ventilation effect of ventilated supercavity has been considered in the optimization process and the required ventilation rate has been calculated two optimization problems have been presented without and with considering the effect of ventilation the results showed that the optimum value of the cavitator radius is smaller for the vehicle with ventilated supercavity which has led to the smaller drag force of cavitator higher speed of the vehicle and higher range the comparison between the cavity shapes for the conventional and modified optimization problems showed that cavity size is smaller for the case of modified optimization problem finally it was suggested that the presented novel optimization process by considering the ventilation effect is a useful tool for investigation of the optimal performance of high speed underwater vehicles in the practical cases with ventilated supercavities 
22866,experimental researches on flat plates and ship models show that among many different methods of drag reduction air layer drag reduction aldr seems to be one of the most efficient methods the physics behind different phenomena in this method is not completely clear and numerical modeling can help resolving this manner there is a lack of exact numerical modeling of this flow because of its complexity and huge numerical cost due to the two phase instabilities in case of dns also common cfd simulations using urans models involve significant errors in this paper an efficient method for numerical modeling of aldr is introduced which is a combination of linear stability and urans modeling of the flowfield the base flow is extracted from cfd which is used in linear stability analysis as the basis which results the frequency of the most unstable mode the final cfd simulation is then carried out plus an additional perturbation term with that specific frequency results show that the implementation of this strategy significantly improves the results of the numerical modeling compared to the experimental results the predicted flowfields also show some new aspects of physics of aldr that had not been previously shown in experimental tests keywords air layer drag reduction cfd linear stability analysis perturbation 1 introduction nowadays ships are one of the most conventional vehicles in international commerce they have many pros but also some cons the main weakness of ships compared to other means of transportation is their low speed although they are quite efficient in terms of energy consumption per ton of freight mile and consequently low emissions their global fuel consumption and environmental pollution are important parameters due to their extensive usage therefore reducing their fuel consumption would be quite important and is broadly studied in present times of high hydrocarbon fuel consumption and large environmental costs all of these are mainly due to large drag force of ships that can be reduced by various drag reduction techniques the drag force consists of form and frictional drag components that their share in total drag depends on the ship geometry froude number most of the ships drag force is usually due to frictional force and its share in total drag is different for different ship geometries as for typical large commercial ships can be about 60 butterworth et al 2015 mäkiharju et al 2012 or even up to 80 park et al 2015 of their total drag any reduction in frictional resistance means either lower fuel consumption or higher speed as well as lower c o 2 emission rate from recent studies it seems that the air lubrication methods can be one of the promising and fruitful methods of drag reduction elbing et al 2008 classified air lubrication methods into three main types bubble drag reduction bdr air layer drag reduction aldr and partial cavity drag reduction pcdr and also a transition between bdr and aldr in bubble drag reduction bdr bubbles or micro bubbles are injected into the wall boundary layer to lower the wall shear stress many researchers have studied this method and various results have been reported that some of them were listed in two review articles by murai 2014 and perlin et al 2016 mccormick and bhattacharyya 1973 introduced the main idea of creating hydrogen micro bubbles on a body of revolution through electrolysis of water although the main mechanism of drag reduction in bdr is not clear there are some hypothesis as air bubbles inside the buffer layer of the turbulent boundary layer change the velocity profile in boundary layer mccormick and bhattacharyya 1973 air bubbles decrease the viscosity of the fluid in boundary layer air bubbles decrease the density of the fluid and thus the reynolds stresses which depend on the density decrease skudarnov and lin 2006 air bubbles prevent the formation or reduce the strength of the stream wise vortices which decreases the turbulence of the flow in the boundary layer kanai and miyata 2001 researchers have reported a vast range of drag reduction ratios the ratio between the change in drag force and the drag force of base flow without injection d d b a s e d b a s e in their experimental and numerical studies of the bdr method that murai 2014 listed them in tables regarding this type of drag reduction there remain some important questions about the proper size of bubbles injection methods and injection flow rates merkle et al 1990 and later murai et al 2007 and murai 2014 in a more complete view reported that in bdr the best size of bubbles is an order of magnitude larger than the viscous sublayer and an order of magnitude smaller than the boundary layer thickness whereas bubbles with the size of same order as boundary layer size can increase the drag murai 2014 stated that this increase in drag is due to the increase in effective viscosity of flow because of the motion and vibration of bubbles inside the boundary layer although a proper bubble size would be determined for any specific case elbing et al 2008 confirms the madavan et al 1984 opinion that the final size of the injected bubbles is different from the initial injected size due to their coalescences and breakups downstream of the injection point hence there is no guaranty that the proper size of bubbles that depends on the injection flow rate and free stream velocity could be preserved the more complete studies of bdr showed that this method has another important shortcoming it is reported that the bubble drag reduction has its main effect just near the injection point but continuing downstream from the injection point the bubbles leave the wall adjacency kodama et al 2000 merkle et al 1990 and hence their effect reduces significantly kodama et al 2000 tested a long model and showed the drag reduction ratio decreases to a few percent less than 20 after 20 m from the injection point which was also the case in wu et al 1994 instance with less than 25 after 6 m elbing et al 2008 results showed even worse with lower than 10 dr at locations farther than about 2 m from injection point in the next type of air lubrication drag reduction aldr the injected air makes a continuous layer covering the solid wall in aldr the required air flux is more than bdr and the drag reduction is about 90 of the frictional drag elbing et al 2008 the air layer can be produced by injecting air from a continuous slot elbing et al 2008 or from one or more injection holes mäkiharju et al 2017 makiharju and ceccio 2018 the developed air layer may disintegrate into parts when the air flux is not sufficient or some upstream perturbations are present elbing et al 2008 and elbing et al 2013 showed that inserting a backward step just upstream of the injection location can lower the sensitivity of the air layer to the upstream perturbations induced by vortex generators wake this type of air lubrication is also named external cavity in some publications rotte et al 2016 however jang et al 2014 stated that inserting the backward step upstream of injection point increases the air leakage from side edges of ship hull which results in air layer collapsing in pcdr the last type in the classification air is injected into a cavity under the hull which is filled with air the air cavity ends at a recess at the end of the hull pcdr locks up air inside the cavity and thus consumes less air flux about one third in comparison with aldr makiharju et al 2013 makiharju et al 2013 showed that the air flux needed by pcdr rises when the vessel speed is not in the range of designed cavity also as rotte et al 2016 stated pcdr has a major difficulty by turning off the air injection system because of any reason the hull profile makes more drag than a simple hull thus vessels with embedded cavity must use air injection system all the time mäkiharju et al 2012 showed that aldr and pcdr energy saving is not so different 19 for aldr vs 22 for pcdr but as the pcdr needs more change in geometry of hull it is not so favorable to be used in current ships rotte et al 2016 however pcdr is studied more than the aldr and some favorable and unfavorable points are reported cucinotta et al 2017 experimentally showed that the pcdr for planning hulls can lower the drag by about 20 at high speeds but no reduction at low speeds butterworth et al 2015 tested pcdr on a ship mockup and reported that although the drag reduction is about 15 for 0 6 m s it is just 2 for 0 9 m s and even a drag increase by 3 is achieved for 1 2 m s also makiharju et al 2013 stated that for very low speeds the pcdr cannot be established as a conclusion it seems that although there are many studies that show drag reduction gain the ratio of drag reduction to the void fraction at wall adjacency by bdr is much higher than other methods it lacks the ability for the practical use in hydrodynamics mostly because of the rapid loss in drag reduction downstream of the injection point many tried to improve the bdr method but the results show that it needs multiple injection stations along the hull rather than single one to preserve its high reduction rate high the whole hull on the other hand the aldr and pcdr are more interesting by almost 100 reduction in the frictional drag pcdr needs low air flow rate but additional change in the geometry of the hull is required while aldr needs more air flux and also there is lack of knowledge about its stability and applicability park et al 2015 tried to lower the air consumption of aldr by inserting some periodic interruptions in injection of the air they showed that this method has the ability to lower the drag at the same level as the continuous air injection with less total air consumption ceccio 2010 stated that power loss due to friction drag is almost proportional to the third power of speed while according to the data of elbing et al 2008 the air flux needed by aldr is almost proportional to the second power of the speed thus the aldr is more efficient for high speed vessels the main advantage of aldr over pcdr is that for pcdr the hull should be designed for a specific speed range and the ship may encounter some drag increase at off designed speeds but it is not the case for aldr which needs only a proper air flux for any speed as a result more study on the stability of aldr and its applicability on practical ships hull is relevant and required most studies of aldr are experimental tests fukuda et al 2000 elbing et al 2008 jagdish et al 2014 jang et al 2014 butterworth et al 2015 pearce et al 2015 mäkiharju et al 2017 makiharju and ceccio 2018 in large water channels on ships mock ups or even on real size ships mizokami et al 2010 remarkably there are a few numerical studies and simulations regarding aldr problems among these are the followings wang et al 2010 who tried to model the elbing et al 2008 s experiments by low cost numerical simulation they found that in their cfd modeling prediction of the critical air flux is much lower than the experiment as is also shown later in this study they used urans modeling of multiphase flow and their results show a stable and continuous layer of air for most air injection fluxes except very low values kim and moin 2010 modeled air layer in a small domain by dns and showed that the air layer is stable for high air flux and is unstable for low flux the stable air layer brings about 100 reduction in wall shear stress but shear reduction for unstable layer reduces with the distance from injection point although most of researchers prefer to study the air injection from slot to have nearly 2d flow field there are some studies which prefer the injection from one or multiple holes mäkiharju et al 2017 makiharju and ceccio 2018 mäkiharju et al 2017 also modeled the air layer numerically and good agreement was shown in comparison with their experiment an important point in their study is that the air layer thickness was of the order of centimeters about 2 5 cm which is much thicker than the thin air layer with the size of millimeters that is the case in elbing et al 2008 and jang et al 2014 tests and possibly would not be used in the practical applications of this method thus as they have considered only high air flux cases their numerical procedure cannot be judged for low air flux with thin air layer the authors of the present paper have come to this belief that the main difficulty in numerical modeling of the thin air layer is the instability of the two phase flow with high sensitivity due to small thickness of air layer rotte et al 2016 discussed the instabilities of air layer and concluded that two main instabilities are responsible for air layer rupture re entrant jet and wave pinch off re entrant jet mostly influences the closure region mainly in pcdr but kelvin helmholtz k h waves are present in air layer and for unstable flow the amplitude of the waves increases to levels that finally make the rupture of the layer also kim and moin 2010 showed this wavy form of air liquid interface in their dns results capturing the k h instability waves of multiphase flows numerically in practical problems is not so simple most of the researchers use les or even dns to simulate the instability of two phase flows in different problems such as jet breakups but these are not feasible in ships hydrodynamic study regarding large size of domains the main problem is that in problems such as jet breakup the domain size and the effective size of instabilities are close but in aldr the domain size is about tens of meters while the instabilities arise in a layer with thickness of millimeters order rotte et al 2016 stated that the re entrant jet can be modeled with proper rans models but the wave pinch off needs a more advanced model such as les or another scale resolving simulation although some researchers have tried to find a way to simulate instabilities effects in two phase flow with simple and cost worthy rans models there is no successful answer to the writer s knowledge as an example shirani et al 2006 suggested two source terms in momentum and phase transport equations each with a constant coefficient although they showed that their model is capable of predicting more realistic results of overall flow field with proper tuning of coefficients the source term in phase equation results in unrealistic numerical phase change and therefore the mass conservation of each phase is not preserved moreover the coefficients should be tuned for each problem and no closure model was proposed for them also researchers have stated that rans models suffer from high eddy viscosity near the interface of two phases with high density ratio they use the reboud correction which damps the eddy viscosity with the aid of a function of density dasilva 2011 checked several common rans models and showed that some of them need this correction but the sst model doesn t need any reboud correction as it doesn t over predict the eddy viscosity the aim of this study is to determine a strategy for proper numerical simulation of the thin air layer without resorting to complex numerical methods such as les or dns hence the experimental tests of elbing et al 2008 on flat plate are chosen as the validation check points first an investigation is done on different rans turbulence models in section 2 and it is shown that the best model for this problem is the sst model which has the correct overall behavior with respect to change in air injection flow rate then to improve the sst results in section 3 it is shown that the cfd modeling of the problem with the addition of a harmonic perturbation in the boundary condition can lead to more realistic results finally linear stability analysis is introduced in section 4 to determine the required perturbation frequency the final strategy consists of a coupled cfd and orr sommerfeld analysis which seems to yield acceptable results with low computational cost restating the procedure the linear stability analysis is used to find proper estimate of perturbation frequency to avoid the need for checking wide range of perturbation frequencies in cfd simulation then the resulted frequencies could be used in the final cfd simulation 2 simple cfd solution as kim and moin 2010 s dns results show the desirable numerical result should model a continuous air layer al which is created from the injection point and continued to a location downstream depending on the air flux for a low air flux which is not sufficient to make a stable al the al should encounter instabilities and disintegrate into patches of air and bubbles after some distance which is required for instabilities growth this can be seen in kim and moin 2010 air water interface snapshots and also in their skin friction plot they simulated two air fluxes which one is said to be sufficient to make al but the other is less than the required value the higher air flux resulted in a continuous al but the lower air flux resulted in instability growth and disintegration of al in their air water interface shape waves can be seen for both the higher and lower air fluxes while they do not grow in amplitude for the higher air flux but growing waves for the lower air flux finally causes the al disintegration also skin friction coefficient shows that wall shear stress is near zero throughout the simulated domain for high air flux with continuous al but for the lower air flux shear stress remains near zero just up to a distance downstream the injection point and then it gradually grows and the al effect on drag reduction disappears pearce et al 2015 results of experimental air layer formation downstream of a backward step show similar behavior in their results the stable length of al increases by increasing the air flux a similar phenomenon may also be recognized from elbing et al 2008 s experimental results although their claim is different they stated that a critical air flux exists and the air layer cannot be formed for lower air fluxes but al develops to the entire flat plate length for higher values studying their results fig 1 for air fluxes lower than the critical value it can be seen that the drag reduction for sensors closer to the injection slot is higher than sensors further downstream it can be concluded that for air fluxes lower than the critical value the air layer is formed and covers the first initial sensor but further downstream the layer becomes unstable and disintegrates into parts and bubbles thus the drag reduction recorded by other downstream sensors were lowered however a different perception can be drawn from elbing et al 2008 s results similar to their own assertion the high dr which was sensed by the first sensor may be interpreted as high dr for bdr in locations near the injection point in this manner other sensors have sensed low dr due to lower void fraction in the boundary layer sensors except the first one show somewhat similar drag reduction and their dr reaches to high values higher than 80 by the critical air flux almost simultaneously this is in agreement with elbing et al 2008 s claim that a critical air flux exist air fluxes lower than the critical value results in bdr and air fluxes higher than the critical value make aldr with high dr on the entire flat plate although this interpretation may seem to be correct it is not the case that dns results of kim and moin 2010 show if the dns results of kim and moin and experimental results of pearce et al is assumed to be correct the length of the al can be understood from the drag reduction value of different sensors at different positions for example in elbing et al 2008 for 0 02 m 2 s air flux none of the sensors show high drag reduction while for 0 04 m 2 s the first sensor shows high drag reduction but others show only mild values it can be interpreted that for 0 02 m 2 s air flux no air layer is developed up to the location of the first sensor for 0 04 m 2 s air flux an air layer developed and covered the first sensor but it discontinued and did not cover the other sensors and the al disintegrated between the first and second sensors increasing the air flux causes the stable air layer continuation toward downstream longer al results in high dr ratio detected by all of the sensors after 0 08 m 2 s air flux at the first step of numerical modeling a 2 d multiphase cfd simulation of the flow on a flat plate was carried out using vof multiphase model and different turbulence models on a commercial cfd package elbing et al 2008 s experiment was chosen as the reference case for this study the actual size of their cavitation tunnel test section domain was discretized into quadrilateral cells and finite volume solution of the n s equations using second order discretization methods was accomplished air was injected through an inclined slot just the same way as elbing et al 2008 s slot a shape various turbulence models for simulation of this flow were investigated and some of the results are presented here fig 2 and table 1 show the results of these turbulence models for two different air fluxes air water interface shapes in fig 2 and length of continuous al before complete disintegration in table 1 show some important aspects of various turbulence models results regarding the fact that for higher air fluxes the al should remain stable for a longer length along the plate and vice versa the last column of table 1 has been marked by physical non physical to show that the trend of different turbulence models is in agreement with basics of experiments or not here real physics is the fact that for higher air flux the results of air water interface shape should be more stable in fig 2 and length of the al before disintegration should be higher than the lower air flux results if a turbulence model predicts this behavior without any constraints on correct al length in comparison with experimental results it is labeled as physical and any turbulence model that resulted in inverted behavior more stable al and longer al length for lower air flux is labeled as non physical the results in this figure and the table show that except for sst model other predictions are unrealistic the air water interface for 0 02 m 2 s air flux is more stable and smoother than the interface for the higher air flux in k ε rng and k k l ω application but sst model predicts the air water interface for 0 04 m 2 s air flux completely stable and smooth while this is not the case for 0 02 m 2 s air flux which encounters an instability and finally the al disintegrates into parts at about 7 m downstream of the injection point more quantitative form of these results i e disintegration length shown in table 1 emphasizes the same erroneous trend for three turbulence models and correct trend for sst model in contradiction with experimental results as the sst model was the only model that predicted the correct behavior it was chosen as the preferred model for the rest of this study however its prediction of al length is still far from experiments as can be seen in the first row of table 1 for 0 04 m 2 s air flux with completely stable al throughout the surface therefore sst model is not capable of predicting the observed instabilities in experiments and over predicts the drag reduction with a stable air layer which is also reported by wang et al 2010 to ensure the grid independence of the aforementioned results four grids were created as listed in table 2 these grids contain quadrilateral cells with enhanced concentration near the plate wall and uniform distribution in stream wise direction in fig 3 the air layer thickness is plotted for four different numerical grids also normalized velocity is defined as u u 0 where u 0 is the interface velocity and normalized y is defined as d y d where y is the distance from the solid wall and d is the al thickness the normalized velocity profiles of the boundary layer are plotted in fig 4 as it can be concluded from these figures the third grid was chosen as the proper grid this grid was later used to correctly predict the velocity profile as can be seen in fig 3 there are some perturbations at the interface although these perturbations are predicted by the turbulence model by itself their frequency and energy contents are not enough to initiate a sensible instability in the layer in order to have more realistic simulations some modifications are necessary either in turbulence models or in the overall strategy of modeling that is described in the followings in order to provide an extensive view of the results the sst model was applied to four different air fluxes and the results of the air layer thickness are shown in fig 5 as it can be seen the higher the air flux the thicker the air layer all air fluxes resulted in a rapid thickening in al and then they relax the initial thickening is mostly because of air injection direction which has a 12 inclination with flat plate surface it should be noted that the scaling of vertical axis in fig 5 is too much smaller than the horizontal one the slope of the al interface at initial thickening region can be calculated and is about 0 3 the high momentum water flow impacts and mixes with low momentum air flow with an inclined velocity e g about 7 m s for 0 04 m 2 s air flux simple momentum conservation law results in 0 3 final flow direction similar to cfd results after the initial thickening low air fluxes show a reduction in al thickness which is the result of increase in air velocity because of air water interface shear stress higher air fluxes i e 0 05 m 2 s bring about thicker al and hence lower influence of interface shear stresses fig 5 shows that the sst model prediction for the case of 0 02 m 2 s air flux is different from others and it is the only case which encounters instability through 10 m flat plate for this flux the huge variation of al indicates that the layer starts to disintegrate probably into bubbles at the location of about 5 5 m from the injection location however as experimental results show all of the cases in fig 5 must be more unstable and especially for the 0 02 m 2 s air flux case there should be almost no developed air layer development of the al must be accomplished gradually with increasing the air flux upto a critical flux which should result in a continuous developed al on the entire flat plate 3 perturbed cfd simulation the authors of present paper believe that the main shortcoming of rans models specifically the sst model is related to the initial disturbance of the flow and its frequency content noticing that prediction of an al development and possible disintegration location along the flat plate is strongly dependent on the initial disturbance and frequency content large eddy simulations can model the initial perturbed flow by setting different viscosity values of sub grid scale in different cells so there is a different diffusion term in adjacent cells resulting in various flow response that provide required broadband perturbations in contrast the turbulent viscosity of rans models does not vary spatially to a great extent in ordinary flow fields and usually a smooth change is predicted by the differential equation governing turbulence parameters also these models usually include infinitesimal perturbations due to numerical errors but often the simulated perturbations frequency content is not necessarily wide enough and also larger perturbations cannot be seen correctly in rans models due to large turbulent viscosity values that filter out small fluctuations of parameters in the flow field this shortcoming of rans models is resolved to some extent by scale adaptive simulations as they dynamically adjust the resolved structures similar to les behavior in unsteady regions of the flow field menter and egorov 2005 to check the sst capability in modeling of perturbed flow a simple sinusoidal fluctuation was added to the air flow rate and the amplification of this wave downstream of the injection point was checked the fluctuation had a specific frequency which was changed in each case some selected frequencies are reported here to find the effect of any specific frequency on the response of the flow as can be seen in fig 6 the air layer is stable for the simple case without any additional fluctuations but by perturbing the air flow rate the air layer also starts to fluctuate for some injection perturbation frequencies the response of the flow is an amplification in air layer thickness unstable cases but for some other the fluctuation amplitude decreases and tends to zero stable cases or remains at almost constant amplitude marginally stable cases fig 6 shows the response of air layer to the frequency change of perturbations as mentioned before for zero frequency no fluctuation case the interface is smooth and stable increasing the frequency it starts to amplify the perturbations and so the air layer degenerates to fragments and possibly bubbles at the end part of the flat plate further increase of the frequency decreases the continuous air layer length until it reaches its minimum length at a specific frequency here about 200 r a d s beyond this point more increase of frequency results in lower amplification of the perturbation and thus more smooth air layer length at high enough frequencies a return to full stable mode prevails and the air layer continues to the end of flat plate smoothly it should be noted that all of these perturbations were made with the same amplitude about 3 of main flow velocity thus the energy of the added perturbation is higher for higher frequency cases full stable response of the flow in high frequencies high energy perturbations shows that the flow response depends mainly on the perturbation frequency and not on its energy it is worth mentioning that the time step was properly adjusted at each case and especially for higher frequency simulations from these results it may be concluded that the sst model with the addition of a properly constructed frequency wise perturbation in the air flux is the most capable and promising rans turbulence model for prediction of both the stable and unstable behavior at different flow conditions this point would be more substantiated in later sections however as the comparison between simple cfd simulations and experimental results shows cfd simulations using rans models are generally more stable especially in air layer flow addition of proper perturbations would trigger the unstable modes of the main flow and hence the more realistic results would occur in the air water interface reported in kim and moin 2010 it can be seen that there exist waves with different wave lengths at the interface and the growing wave is one of them the results of perturbed flow fig 6 hint that if waves with the correct frequency exists in the flow the present cfd analysis may predict the correct amplification to check the result of the perturbed flow prediction in comparison with experimental results perturbation was added to the air flow rate with many different frequencies and the most unstable cases was extracted and their results will be shown later a question remains to be answered whether the most unstable cfd results is physical or not it can be argued that if a perturbation with the frequency of the most unstable mode happens in the real world this mode is the most capable mode to make the flow unstable and would be the dominant mode far enough downstream for the problem at hand now the question may arise what happens if the most unstable frequency does not occur in a real situation the answer is not so obvious as there are many small perturbation components with different amplitudes and shapes in a real flow some of them can be assumed as periodic perturbations with one or more frequencies while others are not periodic and may be even fully random perturbations as a random perturbation e g white noise contains almost all frequencies in the frequency range it should also include the most unstable frequency and the result may be similar to the most unstable harmonic one to check whether random perturbations can provoke the flow to the same state as the most unstable mode stimulated by harmonic perturbation does white noise was added to the air flow rate instead of harmonic perturbation fig 7 shows the result of white noise perturbation alongside with the most unstable case of the harmonic perturbation in this figure the instantaneous interface shape is plotted as well as the time average of the interface over about 3 s of simulation as it can be seen the white noise also makes the air layer degenerate but it is not as powerful as the harmonic perturbation the averaged interface also shows that the al thickness for harmonic perturbation is less than the thickness for white noise as the air flux is the same for both cases the thinner al means more discrete bubbles and air patches while thicker al means more continuous and contiguous al as the white noise contains almost all frequencies it should degenerate the air layer similar to the harmonically perturbed case but as it can be seen its power in resonance with fluid flow is less than the pure harmonic case which may be due to smaller power share and lack of continuous stimulation in that relevant frequency the best way to check that whether the most unstable case result is what occurs in real world or not is to compare the results with experimental data left part of fig 8 shows this comparison and the results of elbing et al 2008 s and elbing et al 2013 s experiments are plotted alongside current results and wang et al 2010 s cfd ones in this figure the drag reduction percentage is plotted versus nominal air layer thickness which was introduced and used by previous researchers e g jang et al 2014 as a simple parameter of the ratio between 2d air flux and free stream speed as it can be seen there is a considerable improvement in predicting correct drag reduction for different air flow rates in comparison to the previous work published in literature wang et al 2010 as it can be seen wang et al 2010 s results are far from experimental ones especially in critical nominal thickness the minimum nominal air layer thickness for which the drag reduction would be more than 80 but the present study has predicted correct critical nominal air layer another point is that the 2013 and 2008 results of experiment are in agreement with each other these experimental tests have a major difference elbing et al 2008 injected air from a slot directly beneath the flat plate while elbing et al 2013 injected air behind a backward facing step the agreement between these two results show that inserting a back step may not change the flow field significantly as a double check on the perturbed cfd results the elbing et al 2013 s test was also simulated with similar procedure as previous ones results of this simulation are plotted in the right part of fig 8 similar agreement of current results and experimental results of drag reduction with air injection behind a backward facing step is seen in this figure this agreement shows that the proposed procedure can be used in aldr simulation either in simple cases or cases with the use of back step from fig 8 a limitation of the perturbed flow analysis results is the correct computation of the drag reduction in low air flow rates with nominal air layer thickness of less than 4 m m where there is no continuous stable air layer and the drag reduction is mostly due to bubbles and air patches this transition region contains all the air layers air patches large bubbles and small bubbles simultaneously this region is more complicated than the bdr or aldr alone regions the bdr region only contains small bubbles and as murai 2014 pointed is the easiest mode of air lubrication method for numerical modeling because it can be modeled in a single phase manner with either dispersed bubbles or mixture method on the other hand aldr alone is a stable two phase flow similar to simple free surface problems all the instabilities and large number of coalescence and breakup of bubbles and air pockets are present mostly in the transitional region usually ensued from unstable behavior of aldr a simple urans modeling of this problem results in a very stable air layer without enough breakups as wang et al 2010 also showed but the proposed perturbation can bring in some breakups to the flow and provides more conformity with the experiments however it is not far from expectation as rans model on such a numerical grid are not successful in correct prediction of interactions of the bubbles vibrations and water flow in boundary layer as an example of one of the difficulties the existence of large bubbles in boundary layer for flow rates with nominal air layer thickness of about 2 m m can be mentioned murai 2014 showed that large bubbles inside the boundary layer can lead to drag increase instead of decrease but modeling these bubble vibrations and deformations and their interaction with the base water flow is not in the range of rans modeling thus the predicted drag reduction is higher than experimental results in these regions although the drag reduction in low air flux regions is not predicted correctly the critical air flux and nominal thickness is predicted correctly as it is evident in fig 8 current results are in more agreement in all regions even in low air flux regions with experimental results than wang et al 2010 s results which are the results of simple cfd simulations another interesting point in fig 8 is that aldr simulations are done for both u 11 1 and 6 7 m s free stream velocities in this figure the numerical results of these two cases are in high agreement with each other this may be interpreted as the nominal air layer thickness can be used to scale the problem for different free stream velocities in other words from the numerical results it comes to mind that finding the drag reduction of different air fluxes in a specific free stream velocity can be used for other free stream velocity by the usage of nominal air layer thickness using the nominal air layer thickness q a u emphasizes a linear dependence of the required air flux on freestream velocity this is not in agreement with elbing et al 2008 s results that a dependence on second power of free stream is shown also elbing et al 2013 used some analytical calculation and found that the critical air flux should depend on friction velocity u τ and then using different data of their own experimental test and elbing et al 2008 s ones they found that air flux dependence on friction velocity is about u τ 1 8 if the one seventh law turbulent velocity profile is assumed for flat plate elbing et al 2013 s result shows that the critical flow rate depends on velocity as u 1 67 there is a point here elbing et al 2008 and elbing et al 2013 tried to find the dependence of critical air flux on free stream velocity but here the present method result shows an agreement between drag reductions of flow at least for two different free stream velocities in different air fluxes including transitional aldr these two different approaches produce rather similar results but they are not exactly the same dependence of required air flux for a specific drag reduction on free stream velocity can be different for bdr transitional aldr and full aldr in order to provide a more complete validation with experimental results velocity and void fraction distributions were compared to elbing et al 2013 s results the numerical simulation was carried out on the geometry and test conditions of that paper as the numerical simulation shows a highly time dependent and fluctuating properties the time averaged properties were also used as a comparison variable with experimental results fig 9 presents this comparison both in velocity distribution left and void fraction right as can be seen elbing et al 2013 reported liquid and interface velocities independently the liquid velocity profile where the void fraction is relatively low was measured with ldv and the interface velocity profile where the void fraction is not too low or too high was measured with time of flight tof sensors tof sensors can measure the velocity of the interface between the air and water and they suffer from relatively high errors in regions without enough distinguished interfaces like pure air and pure water regions elbing et al 2013 stated that the velocity profile in aldr consists of three parts a a nearly constant velocity region inside the al with velocity magnitude of about 20 of free stream velocity b a nearly linear buffer layer and c a power law profile similar to no injection profile in regions with low void fraction however a constant velocity profile with 20 of freestream velocity magnitude inside the al for any air flux seems strange physically also the measured interface velocity at y δ 0 4 δ is no injection boundary layer thickness where the ldv sensor has also measured the velocity does not have a complete agreement with ldv results this may be because of tof sensor errors or void fraction effects on ldv fig 9 shows that the present numerical results match the liquid velocity profile but the interface velocity distribution is different to some extent if the experimental interface velocity is multiplied by a constant value to have a better agreement between tof and ldv sensors in common regions the agreement between cfd results and experimental ones would be better the right part of fig 9 shows the void fraction distribution of the present numerical study and elbing et al 2013 elbing et al 2013 stated that the reported void fraction for regions closer than y δ 0 1 where the void fraction is near unity is more than 10 uncertain about 15 but in regions with lower void fraction the uncertainty is less than 10 fig 9 shows an agreement on void fraction distribution between present cfd simulation and elbing et al 2013 results in most regions elbing et al 2013 s result near the wall have lower void fraction which seems to be non physical these strange values should be produced by the sensor errors as the void fraction inside the al should be near unity also shown by numerical simulation 4 linear stability analysis up to this point a trick has been applied to extract proper results from numerical modeling of thin air layer however another problem arises that one should examine a vast range of perturbation frequencies to find the most unstable one also while sweeping the frequencies of perturbations from small values to a large value that the flow returns to its stable mode there is no guarantee that no other larger frequency exists for which the flow might be in more unstable mode the standard way around this problem is to check the unstable mode frequencies via a linear stability analysis in literature there are many studies on linear and fewer on non linear stability analysis for different flow problems in two phase stability problems most researchers prefer to mainly distinguish stable from unstable cases without any special interest in determining flow field in the unstable cases they mostly solve two phase orr sommerfeld equation to find out if there is any unstable mode yih 1967 showed that the viscosity stratification in plane couette flow causes instabilities for any reynolds number some researchers worked on liquid layer in gas domain which may happen in condensation of vapor on the walls of large diameter pipes and channels miesen and boersma 1995 boomkamp et al 1997 many other worked on plane or round jet of liquid injected into air domain and its breakup mahdavi et al 2013 soderberg 2003 kim and moin 2010 studied linear stability of air layer alongside dns of the flow they showed the conformity of two different methods i e for the case that the dns results in a stable flow the linear stability analysis also shows stability and for unstable case in dns linear stability analysis also predicts unstable modes to perform a linear stability analysis on air layer problem fig 10 the non dimensional navier stokes equations were written for the base flow then full perturbed navier stokes equations were written and equations governing the base flow were subtracted from them to obtain equations for the perturbation terms assuming small perturbations the second power of perturbations in the relevant set of equations can be neglected and the equations would be simplified the simplified non dimensionalized momentum equations of the perturbed terms can be written as in equation 1 1 x x d y y d t τ d u 0 u u u 0 v v u 0 p p ρ j u 0 2 u u u v v v p p p u u u v v v p p p u τ u u x u u x v u y v u y ρ j ρ p x ν ν j ℜ

variables of the gas jet air layer and uppercases are the base flow non perturbed variables introducing the stream function of perturbations ψ for the gas jet part and ϕ for the liquid part and writing them in exponential form the momentum equations combine into a single ordinary differential equation if the y velocity v and the stream wise derivative of parameters could be neglected the

conditions at this interface can be obtained from no slip and no penetration conditions another condition can be obtained from shear stress equality at two sides of the interface and finally the condition that the difference between normal stresses of two sides of the interface is equal to the surface tension gives the fourth boundary condition these equations are listed in equation 4

boundary conditions of no slip and no penetration at both the solid wall and a virtual free stream wall at the other side as is shown in fig 10 the needed eight boundary conditions of the two phase forth order differential equation are obtained orr sommerfeld equation with these boundary conditions cannot be solved analytically and must be solved numerically as many researchers mentioned for a highly accurate solution of this equation in order to resolve unstable modes chebyshev polynomials should be used orszag 1971 thus the numerical solution of the equation using chebyshev polynomials was carried out kim and moin 2010 used linear and parabolic velocity profiles as the base flow in their stability analysis however they focused mostly on linear two phase fully developed couette flow profile like many other authors some other researchers used more real piecewise linear or fully non linear velocity profiles as the base velocity in their linear stability analysis in analysis of thin liquid layer in adjacency of moving gas environment miesen and boersma 1995 and boomkamp et al 1997 used a linear velocity profile for the liquid layer near the wall two part piecewise linear profile for the gas domain velocity was used by miesen et al while boomkamp et al employed a more realistic profile which includes a linear viscous sublayer and a special hyperbolic tangent form for the rest of boundary layer which miles 1962 had introduced as an empirical wind velocity profile boomkamp et al stated that the effective part of the gas domain velocity profile is the linear viscous sub layer and the curvature of the gas flow velocity profile does not have significant effect on the stability of the flow one of the most advanced velocity profile is used by söderberg and alfredsson 1998 and soderberg 2003 who studied the liquid plane jet breakup and used a velocity profile similar to the stokes first problem equation 5 for the gas domain and a velocity profile extracted from cfd simulations for the liquid jet the idea of using a velocity profile similar to the stokes first problem seems to be interesting as it is simple and also can become an accurate boundary layer profile over a flat plate 5 u u 0 e r f y 2 ν t u u 0 e r f y 2 u 0 ν x it can be shown that this velocity profile with the addition of a constant coefficient here a value about π 2 can become similar to the well known blasius velocity profile of the flow on a flat plate fig 11 shows the blasius profile and a modified stokes profile u u 0 e r f y π u 0 ν x pay attention to the additional π in the error function argument which does not exist in stokes first problem solution this agreement hints that with addition of a constant this velocity profile interpolates closely a physical boundary layer profile in flat plate case the velocity that is used in conversion of stokes solution from time dependent to a space dependent one is the free stream velocity which is constant and convects the data from upstream to downstream söderberg and alfredsson 1998 and soderberg 2003 used this velocity profile as the environment velocity near the jet in that case as the interface velocity changes by location the velocity which was used to convert time to space was not really constant however in cases that the change in velocity is small in comparison with boundary layer growth rate no significant error is expected but implementing any analysis with hypothesis of constant velocity in stream wise direction should be avoided in regions with large stream wise changes of variables in comparison with changes of variables in lateral direction thus the regions near the jet nozzle should not be used for these analysis this velocity profile is used here in a more complicated form as described in following in order to improve solution accuracy it was decided to set a velocity profile similar to the real one in present study keeping in mind the stokes first problem solution and its agreement with blasius boundary layer profile a template of the velocity profile is introduced in equation 6 this template is a summation of three boundary layer profiles similar to equation 5 with additional constant coefficients also the template was written such that the velocity meets the no slip at solid wall for jet layer profile virtual free stream wall for environmental profile and air water interface conditions by its own however this template is just a template and any other form of velocity functions can be used to simulate the real velocity profile the main advantage of this profile over an arbitrary velocity function e g polynomials is that it originates from physics and it should match better with real profile with less tuning coefficients some general functions e g polynomials which may be used here in curve fitting suffer from non physical fluctuations which may cause non physical modes from linear stability analysis also the difference of using velocity profiles similar to real one with simplified linear profile is shown later in fig 14 6 u j e t u m 1 e r f d y 2 μ j c 1 x ρ j u m e r f d 2 μ j c 1 x ρ j u m u m u 0 u m 1 e r f y 2 μ j c 2 x ρ j u m u 0 e r f d 2 μ

boundary layer growth on the interface fig 10 both with a profile similar to equation 5 the wall side boundary layer uses a mean velocity u m which is not necessarily the average of velocity in the gas region but a velocity that propagates the information through that region and should be evaluated later the boundary layer of the interface side uses the difference between the interface velocity u 0 and u m on the other hand the water velocity profile environment region also consists of two parts a thick boundary layer which is due to the pre injection wall effect and a thin boundary layer due to the difference between the interface velocity and the velocity due to the first part in order to satisfy all boundary conditions and also continuity of the gas layer met two additional conditions were set firstly for the continuity the integral of the jet region velocity profile should be equal to the injection flow rate and secondly for shear stress equality the slope of the velocity profiles on either sides of interface should be proportional to inverse of the viscosity ratio solving for these two conditions mean velocity of the jet region u m and interface induced velocity slope in environment u p would be obtained as all boundary layers thickness mentioned above vary with location x proper localized values should be used in the analysis also the velocity profile contains some parameters such as u m u 0 and air layer thickness that are not constant from the injection point to any downstream point just like the boundary layer thickness as these variables do not change the same way as the boundary layer the profile cannot estimate the real profile automatically by just setting the proper x value therefore some constant coefficients were placed as calibration coefficients for each term and are shown as c i in equation 6 to have a good curve fit of the mentioned profile with cfd velocity results one can adjust these coefficients c i to produce a near best fit as mentioned before and also as soderberg 2003 has used this analysis is acceptable for cases with minor change of the flow parameters in stream wise direction thus this should not be used in regions with high deformation of interface or where the velocity profile changes a lot having such a complex velocity profile template it can be used to fit any realistic profile of the problem in hand as mentioned above the cfd solution of this flow without artificial fluctuations shows an almost stable and smooth air layer which can be a good choice as the base flow in stability analysis therefore a full cfd simulation was carried out without any artificial fluctuations in order to capture the base flow air layer thickness and velocity profiles the velocity profiles of cfd solutions at different locations are plotted in fig 12 in this figure the velocity and y coordinate are normalized the same way as done before in fig 4 as can be seen there is a significant difference between these results with simple linear profile however it must be mentioned that the velocity profile tends to linear profile gradually as proceeding downstream but for the case of interest the length of the flat plate is not enough for a fully developed air layer close to the injection location the change in velocity profile and air layer thickness is not so small but as the air flows downstream the slope of change in velocity and al thickness decreases and reaches a small value such that its derivative with respect to x can be neglected in such regions the equation might be solved as was done by soderberg 2003 to satisfy linear stability conditions the numerical cfd results are fitted by profiles with the shape presented in equation 6 also for fine tuning four calibration constant values were manually set to have the best fit fig 13 shows the cfd results and the fitted profiles for different x locations as can be seen the template was fitted to cfd results in different downstream locations with completely different velocity profiles and just small difference is left between fitted curve and cfd results e g the slope at wall is less than cfd results in this figure the velocity is normalized by friction velocity u τ and y is normalized as y d l where l ν u τ is friction length scale friction velocity and length scale are extracted from cfd simulation at appropriate downstream location for each plot in this figure setting the base velocities in the linear stability analysis code the spectrum of stability would be obtained which is shown for one of the studied cases in fig 14 as can be seen there are two unstable modes that one of them has normalized phase speed c ω k greater than 1 and the other less than 1 as the velocities were normalized by the interface velocity value the normalized value greater than 1 means that the phase speed is greater than the interface velocity and this mode is named the interface mode as called by miles 1957 the other mode with normalized phase velocity smaller than 1 and is the internal mode having a look at the results it can be seen that the growth ratio of the interfacial mode is about an order of magnitude larger than the internal mode although one may assume that the most unstable mode of a flow extracted from stability analysis would be dominant in flow some researchers have stated that it is not necessarily the dominant mode of flow in some problems such as the present one there may be more than one unstable mode in the results of the analysis in such cases for two phase jet flows there may exist many different instabilities which boomkamp et al 1997 listed some of them in this problem the two modes seem to originates from different flow effects the internal mode is due to combination of both viscosity induced instabilities at the interface and reynolds stresses in the jet layer the other unstable mode the interface mode which mostly arises due to tangential disturbances because of viscosity change between phases and usually lies in the environment viscous sublayer when both modes are unstable for one frequency it is said that the internal mode is usually dominant even when its instability power is an order of magnitude lower than the interfacial mode miesen and boersma 1995 boomkamp et al 1997 in fig 14 the results of the analysis with the aid of aforementioned velocity profiles are plotted alongside the analysis with a simple linear velocity profile to find the effect and importance of the correct velocity profile application as can be seen the linear profile results into a strong large growth ratio internal mode with a very weak interfacial mode but conversely the present velocity profile result has a strong interfacial and weak internal mode the more remarkable difference is in frequency space if the spectrum is plotted with perturbation frequency as x axis the linear and nonlinear velocity profiles produce considerably different results where linear internal mode has a peak at 1100 r a d s but nonlinear one has its peak at about 400 r a d s as these profiles make completely different results and logically the more real profile should be more correct one it seems that these plots show the importance of the nonlinear velocity profile usage also to ensure that these results are independent of implemented chebyshev modes number the applied modes both in jet and environment regions denoted by j and e subscripts were varied according to table 3 and the solution spectrum was plotted for each one in fig 15 here sufficient number of chebyshev modes seems to be 25 for jet region and 50 for the environment using these number of modes the stability spectrum is plotted for a few air fluxes in case of 11 1 m s water free stream velocity in fig 16 in this figure the decrease in growth rate of instability is seen by increasing the air flux in compliance with the experimental results an interesting point is that the stability analysis shows a similar behavior of stability instability in comparison with the cfd results both predict almost no instability in non perturbed case zero frequency and reach a most unstable mode in a specific frequency of perturbation and finally return to a stable flow for high enough frequencies both the linear stability spectrum with nonlinear base velocity profile and cfd results for different air flux fluctuation frequencies are plotted in fig 17 both results cfd and linear stability analysis show the same physical trends the higher the air flux the more stable the air layer according to cfd results the lowest air flux produces the least stable air layer length and increasing the air flux causes longer stable air layer in relation to stability analysis both the interfacial mode and the internal mode show such a behavior and the most unstable mode of the flow for 0 04 m 2 s air flux has the largest growth rate in comparison with results related to higher air fluxes also as miesen and boersma 1995 mentioned although the growth rate of the interfacial mode is an order of magnitude larger than the internal mode the internal mode seems to be the dominant mode when both internal and interfacial instabilities are present this is seen when comparing the critical frequency of perturbed cfd and stability analysis here the frequency of interfacial mode is higher and far from cfd results but the frequency of internal mode is closer to the cfd predicted values the cfd results in this figure show the disintegration point of air layer for different air fluxes with different perturbation frequencies total flat plate length in this study is 12 5 m air layer length of cases without disintegration of al is reported as 12 5 m in fig 17 however air layer of unstable modes with the growing perturbations may not finally disintegrate in the studied numerical domain equal to total flat plate length of 12 5 m as an example the case with 0 06 m2 s air flux and 500 rad s perturbation frequency shown in fig 6 indicates very large growth in perturbation amplitude and finally reaches a somewhat constant amplitude in some downstream distance but no disintegration happens therefore in fig 17 the continuous al length for this case is seen to be equal to the total plate length despite that this case is not really fully stable this point results in some apparent inconsistencies of linear stability results with cfd ones in fig 17 fig 17 reconfirms the overall proposed procedure the desired procedure of numerical simulation should be a perturbed cfd simulation which uses the linear stability analysis for estimation of the proper frequency of perturbations the proper critical frequency is the frequency with the highest growth power however in cases where the internal and interfacial modes are present simultaneously the internal mode is usually the dominant mode this procedure can lead to simulation results which are in good agreement with experimental tests results see fig 8 5 discussion thin air layer formation under a flat plate was simulated using cfd urans turbulence model that is perturbed with the proper frequency at inlet boundary condition fig 8 shows very good agreement of the present results compared with experimental drag reduction ratios for different air fluxes however fig 17 shows fair agreement between the predicted unstable frequencies from linear stability analysis and cfd ones which means that the stability analysis could be used to find the proper perturbation frequency in cfd simulations as the drag reduction ratios and the void fraction distribution predicted by the present method are similar to the experimental results and the water velocity distribution is also in agreement with measured values it can be inferred that the present combined method of flow modeling is an acceptable simulation of the real physics of the phenomenon as mentioned before correct numerical simulations of physics may clarify some aspects of the problem that have not been thoroughly studied or uncovered by experimental tests additionally although the main purpose of this study is to determine the critical air flux for any desirable water speed preferably with a low cost cfd simulation it shows some important subjects involved in the real world of applications as explained in the following in previous experimental tests by different researchers the main focus was on the measurement of shear force the sensors measure the wall shear force which is just one aspect of the problem but these sensors show nothing about the mechanism of the shear reduction although some researchers have used photography and void fraction sensors for their tests because of very thin and sensitive air layer measurement of different flow quantities inside the thin air layer is not so straight forward moreover in the present study the shear stress on the wall is simulated with good accuracy but the flow field is different from the previous researchers claims elbing et al 2008 and jang et al 2014 claim that the aldr is a state that the air flux is sufficiently high and the layer is developed throughout the flat plate or hull as of their opinion when the sufficient air flux forms the air layer the layer continues to the end of the plate unless the side edge leakage causes the degeneration of the layer this conclusion is drawn mostly by the results of the shear sensors in their studies they have seen that after a critical air flux the drag reduction sensed by the sensors are almost constant in different locations in the present study the proposed numerical simulation shows the air layer development for vast range of air flux but with different continuous length for lower air flux the air layer disintegrates into parts and bubbles after a small distance downstream of injection point but for higher air flux the degeneration point is shifted further downstream the interesting point is that for low air flux the disintegrated air layer causes a mild drag reduction which is seen in experimental tests results and named as the transitional region but for sufficiently high air flux the air layer makes the wall shear stress to vanish before the degeneration point and continues to have high drag reduction ratio even after the layer disintegration this may be due to high void fraction in the wall adjacency owing to large air pockets and bubbles in this region the drag reduction is such that distinguishing between clean air layer and bubbly region with lots of air pockets and bubbles may not be easy by the use of shear stress sensors it is an important result that in present study numerical simulations show that the al has experienced instabilities and the disintegration has been occurred in most cases for different air fluxes after sufficiently large distance downstream of injection point hence in real size problems such as large ship hulls with much larger dimensions than the flat plates in laboratories the problem should be simulated to check whether the al experiences instabilities disintegration and a gradual decrease in dr or maintains its high dr throughout the hull because of gradual change in velocity profiles downstream and change in stability characteristics of the flow it might be imagined that an al may not disintegrate even at very large downstream distances although 3d main flow and real world perturbations in case of ship sailing make this situation rather hypothetical as mentioned earlier rotte et al 2016 stated that there are two main mechanisms which cause the instabilities in aldr the interface waves and the re entrant jet in present study the interface wave effect is investigated the results show that the interface waves and their growth due to their instabilities can lead to air layer rupture for thin air layers they claimed that the source of wave creation is mostly the turbulence that generates waves with wavelengths of few centimeters in this study it is shown i e in fig 18 that the proper perturbations which lead to the most unstable case have larger wavelengths about 10 40 cm which is called the critical wavelength here fig 18 shows the air layer thickness for the most unstable perturbed flow for three different air fluxes as it can be seen the air layer shape seems not to be a pure sinusoidal profile with an exponential amplification analyzing these layer shapes show that the perturbations are amplified in exponential manner which is stronger larger amplification power for lower air flux and weaker for higher air flux but the profile of the air layer seems to be more complicated than a pure sine wave fig 19 shows the fourier transform of these waves it shows that for all of these three cases the wave has a main frequency which is the frequency that the flow is perturbed by call it critical frequency but there are other frequencies mostly other harmonics of the critical frequency plus some other frequencies that act as a role to form these waves these waves have smaller wavelengths than the critical wavelength and can have more significant interactions with turbulence it seems that the perturbation with critical frequency provokes some other frequencies and these waves make the layer disruption altogether in fig 6 the cases with high frequencies show sine like waves and are almost stable or marginally stable although the energy of the perturbation is higher for high frequencies even when the wave amplitude grows and reaches a large value finally it becomes almost marginally stable these waves with pure sine like shape do not have enough strength to make the layer rupture in contrast lower perturbation frequencies show waves with shapes of more complex form and have amplitude peaks in more than one frequencies in their fourier transform these cases lead to instabilities and the waves amplitude grow until the layer rupture occurs 6 conclusion air layer drag reduction seems to be one of the interesting drag reduction methods for application on large ships previous experimental works show that there is a critical air flux which is the minimum air flux that may sustain the air layer the amount of the air flux and methods for reducing this critical air flux is the main goal of most studies on aldr there are some experimental test results to clarify the physics of this type of air lubrication method but as makiharju and ceccio 2018 mentioned the critical air flux limits that has been proposed by previous researchers are not complete they have shown that in some cases although the air flux is more than the critical amount predicted by scaling methods of elbing et al 2013 the air layer does not establish also there are cases that the air flux is less than the predicted critical value but the air layer is formed understanding the physics of such a phenomenon by the aid of experimental tests is usually difficult and in these cases the numerical modeling would help the researchers as this flow encounters two phase instabilities due to high viscosity ratio and density stratification it cannot be modeled with simple urans turbulence models on a not so dense numerical grid which is usually used in practical problems rotte et al 2016 stated that modeling this instability with simple urans models is hard and needs more advanced turbulence models to have an acceptable flow solution for such problems with a low enough numerical cost for real size application numerical costs of the urans order a new strategy is introduced first some common turbulence models were checked and the sst model showed as the best one to predict the overall behavior of the flow at the next step it was shown that with the addition of some periodic artificial perturbation the sst model can predict amplification of the perturbed flow in some cases also a linear stability analysis with non linear base velocity profile obtained from cfd simulation was carried out it was shown that the most unstable mode of flow in cfd simulations occurs at the same frequency as that of the linear stability analysis predictions as a result the new procedure of numerical solution of thin air layer modeling is concluded as follows 1 do a full cfd modeling of the case with vof multiphase model and sst turbulence model on a proper numerical grid 2 extract the air layer thickness and velocity profile of the flow from the cfd results of step 1 and perform a curve fit of the velocity with a profile similar to equation 6 3 solve the two phase orr sommerfeld equation with the base flow velocity results of step 2 and find the frequency of the most unstable mode 4 do another full cfd modeling similar to step 1 with an addition of the air injection fluctuation with the frequency obtained from step 3 as the final and verifying step the numerical results of such simulations show good agreement with experimental reports in drag reduction ratios for different air flux values and also the velocity and void fraction distribution and are much more accurate than common simple cfd simulations using urans models previous urans modeling of such problem has shown about 80 error in prediction of critical nominal air layer thickness wang et al 2010 while the present method shows only about 10 error meanwhile such an improvement in accuracy of numerical modeling does not cost a lot the present method costs only twice as a simple urans two phase cfd simulation as there are two cfd simulation steps in the procedure also note that the computational cost of linear stability analysis is negligible compared to cfd simulations the numerical cost of the present method is much lower than advanced methods such as les and dns as an example kim and moin 2010 carried out their dns of aldr on a domain of just about 40 cm long and only 1 8 m s free stream velocity with more than 270 million 3d computational cells which needs a huge computer resource while the present results on a 15 m long domain with 11 1 m s free stream velocity were done on a grid with less than 500 thousands of 2d computational cells therefore the required cpu time for the solution of the dns case is more than 500 times more than the present requirement the present method gives the results for a typical case in about one day on a conventional pc with 6 core cpu thus it can be used as a common low cost numerical procedure to have acceptable predictions of the aldr in any similar cases 
22866,experimental researches on flat plates and ship models show that among many different methods of drag reduction air layer drag reduction aldr seems to be one of the most efficient methods the physics behind different phenomena in this method is not completely clear and numerical modeling can help resolving this manner there is a lack of exact numerical modeling of this flow because of its complexity and huge numerical cost due to the two phase instabilities in case of dns also common cfd simulations using urans models involve significant errors in this paper an efficient method for numerical modeling of aldr is introduced which is a combination of linear stability and urans modeling of the flowfield the base flow is extracted from cfd which is used in linear stability analysis as the basis which results the frequency of the most unstable mode the final cfd simulation is then carried out plus an additional perturbation term with that specific frequency results show that the implementation of this strategy significantly improves the results of the numerical modeling compared to the experimental results the predicted flowfields also show some new aspects of physics of aldr that had not been previously shown in experimental tests keywords air layer drag reduction cfd linear stability analysis perturbation 1 introduction nowadays ships are one of the most conventional vehicles in international commerce they have many pros but also some cons the main weakness of ships compared to other means of transportation is their low speed although they are quite efficient in terms of energy consumption per ton of freight mile and consequently low emissions their global fuel consumption and environmental pollution are important parameters due to their extensive usage therefore reducing their fuel consumption would be quite important and is broadly studied in present times of high hydrocarbon fuel consumption and large environmental costs all of these are mainly due to large drag force of ships that can be reduced by various drag reduction techniques the drag force consists of form and frictional drag components that their share in total drag depends on the ship geometry froude number most of the ships drag force is usually due to frictional force and its share in total drag is different for different ship geometries as for typical large commercial ships can be about 60 butterworth et al 2015 mäkiharju et al 2012 or even up to 80 park et al 2015 of their total drag any reduction in frictional resistance means either lower fuel consumption or higher speed as well as lower c o 2 emission rate from recent studies it seems that the air lubrication methods can be one of the promising and fruitful methods of drag reduction elbing et al 2008 classified air lubrication methods into three main types bubble drag reduction bdr air layer drag reduction aldr and partial cavity drag reduction pcdr and also a transition between bdr and aldr in bubble drag reduction bdr bubbles or micro bubbles are injected into the wall boundary layer to lower the wall shear stress many researchers have studied this method and various results have been reported that some of them were listed in two review articles by murai 2014 and perlin et al 2016 mccormick and bhattacharyya 1973 introduced the main idea of creating hydrogen micro bubbles on a body of revolution through electrolysis of water although the main mechanism of drag reduction in bdr is not clear there are some hypothesis as air bubbles inside the buffer layer of the turbulent boundary layer change the velocity profile in boundary layer mccormick and bhattacharyya 1973 air bubbles decrease the viscosity of the fluid in boundary layer air bubbles decrease the density of the fluid and thus the reynolds stresses which depend on the density decrease skudarnov and lin 2006 air bubbles prevent the formation or reduce the strength of the stream wise vortices which decreases the turbulence of the flow in the boundary layer kanai and miyata 2001 researchers have reported a vast range of drag reduction ratios the ratio between the change in drag force and the drag force of base flow without injection d d b a s e d b a s e in their experimental and numerical studies of the bdr method that murai 2014 listed them in tables regarding this type of drag reduction there remain some important questions about the proper size of bubbles injection methods and injection flow rates merkle et al 1990 and later murai et al 2007 and murai 2014 in a more complete view reported that in bdr the best size of bubbles is an order of magnitude larger than the viscous sublayer and an order of magnitude smaller than the boundary layer thickness whereas bubbles with the size of same order as boundary layer size can increase the drag murai 2014 stated that this increase in drag is due to the increase in effective viscosity of flow because of the motion and vibration of bubbles inside the boundary layer although a proper bubble size would be determined for any specific case elbing et al 2008 confirms the madavan et al 1984 opinion that the final size of the injected bubbles is different from the initial injected size due to their coalescences and breakups downstream of the injection point hence there is no guaranty that the proper size of bubbles that depends on the injection flow rate and free stream velocity could be preserved the more complete studies of bdr showed that this method has another important shortcoming it is reported that the bubble drag reduction has its main effect just near the injection point but continuing downstream from the injection point the bubbles leave the wall adjacency kodama et al 2000 merkle et al 1990 and hence their effect reduces significantly kodama et al 2000 tested a long model and showed the drag reduction ratio decreases to a few percent less than 20 after 20 m from the injection point which was also the case in wu et al 1994 instance with less than 25 after 6 m elbing et al 2008 results showed even worse with lower than 10 dr at locations farther than about 2 m from injection point in the next type of air lubrication drag reduction aldr the injected air makes a continuous layer covering the solid wall in aldr the required air flux is more than bdr and the drag reduction is about 90 of the frictional drag elbing et al 2008 the air layer can be produced by injecting air from a continuous slot elbing et al 2008 or from one or more injection holes mäkiharju et al 2017 makiharju and ceccio 2018 the developed air layer may disintegrate into parts when the air flux is not sufficient or some upstream perturbations are present elbing et al 2008 and elbing et al 2013 showed that inserting a backward step just upstream of the injection location can lower the sensitivity of the air layer to the upstream perturbations induced by vortex generators wake this type of air lubrication is also named external cavity in some publications rotte et al 2016 however jang et al 2014 stated that inserting the backward step upstream of injection point increases the air leakage from side edges of ship hull which results in air layer collapsing in pcdr the last type in the classification air is injected into a cavity under the hull which is filled with air the air cavity ends at a recess at the end of the hull pcdr locks up air inside the cavity and thus consumes less air flux about one third in comparison with aldr makiharju et al 2013 makiharju et al 2013 showed that the air flux needed by pcdr rises when the vessel speed is not in the range of designed cavity also as rotte et al 2016 stated pcdr has a major difficulty by turning off the air injection system because of any reason the hull profile makes more drag than a simple hull thus vessels with embedded cavity must use air injection system all the time mäkiharju et al 2012 showed that aldr and pcdr energy saving is not so different 19 for aldr vs 22 for pcdr but as the pcdr needs more change in geometry of hull it is not so favorable to be used in current ships rotte et al 2016 however pcdr is studied more than the aldr and some favorable and unfavorable points are reported cucinotta et al 2017 experimentally showed that the pcdr for planning hulls can lower the drag by about 20 at high speeds but no reduction at low speeds butterworth et al 2015 tested pcdr on a ship mockup and reported that although the drag reduction is about 15 for 0 6 m s it is just 2 for 0 9 m s and even a drag increase by 3 is achieved for 1 2 m s also makiharju et al 2013 stated that for very low speeds the pcdr cannot be established as a conclusion it seems that although there are many studies that show drag reduction gain the ratio of drag reduction to the void fraction at wall adjacency by bdr is much higher than other methods it lacks the ability for the practical use in hydrodynamics mostly because of the rapid loss in drag reduction downstream of the injection point many tried to improve the bdr method but the results show that it needs multiple injection stations along the hull rather than single one to preserve its high reduction rate high the whole hull on the other hand the aldr and pcdr are more interesting by almost 100 reduction in the frictional drag pcdr needs low air flow rate but additional change in the geometry of the hull is required while aldr needs more air flux and also there is lack of knowledge about its stability and applicability park et al 2015 tried to lower the air consumption of aldr by inserting some periodic interruptions in injection of the air they showed that this method has the ability to lower the drag at the same level as the continuous air injection with less total air consumption ceccio 2010 stated that power loss due to friction drag is almost proportional to the third power of speed while according to the data of elbing et al 2008 the air flux needed by aldr is almost proportional to the second power of the speed thus the aldr is more efficient for high speed vessels the main advantage of aldr over pcdr is that for pcdr the hull should be designed for a specific speed range and the ship may encounter some drag increase at off designed speeds but it is not the case for aldr which needs only a proper air flux for any speed as a result more study on the stability of aldr and its applicability on practical ships hull is relevant and required most studies of aldr are experimental tests fukuda et al 2000 elbing et al 2008 jagdish et al 2014 jang et al 2014 butterworth et al 2015 pearce et al 2015 mäkiharju et al 2017 makiharju and ceccio 2018 in large water channels on ships mock ups or even on real size ships mizokami et al 2010 remarkably there are a few numerical studies and simulations regarding aldr problems among these are the followings wang et al 2010 who tried to model the elbing et al 2008 s experiments by low cost numerical simulation they found that in their cfd modeling prediction of the critical air flux is much lower than the experiment as is also shown later in this study they used urans modeling of multiphase flow and their results show a stable and continuous layer of air for most air injection fluxes except very low values kim and moin 2010 modeled air layer in a small domain by dns and showed that the air layer is stable for high air flux and is unstable for low flux the stable air layer brings about 100 reduction in wall shear stress but shear reduction for unstable layer reduces with the distance from injection point although most of researchers prefer to study the air injection from slot to have nearly 2d flow field there are some studies which prefer the injection from one or multiple holes mäkiharju et al 2017 makiharju and ceccio 2018 mäkiharju et al 2017 also modeled the air layer numerically and good agreement was shown in comparison with their experiment an important point in their study is that the air layer thickness was of the order of centimeters about 2 5 cm which is much thicker than the thin air layer with the size of millimeters that is the case in elbing et al 2008 and jang et al 2014 tests and possibly would not be used in the practical applications of this method thus as they have considered only high air flux cases their numerical procedure cannot be judged for low air flux with thin air layer the authors of the present paper have come to this belief that the main difficulty in numerical modeling of the thin air layer is the instability of the two phase flow with high sensitivity due to small thickness of air layer rotte et al 2016 discussed the instabilities of air layer and concluded that two main instabilities are responsible for air layer rupture re entrant jet and wave pinch off re entrant jet mostly influences the closure region mainly in pcdr but kelvin helmholtz k h waves are present in air layer and for unstable flow the amplitude of the waves increases to levels that finally make the rupture of the layer also kim and moin 2010 showed this wavy form of air liquid interface in their dns results capturing the k h instability waves of multiphase flows numerically in practical problems is not so simple most of the researchers use les or even dns to simulate the instability of two phase flows in different problems such as jet breakups but these are not feasible in ships hydrodynamic study regarding large size of domains the main problem is that in problems such as jet breakup the domain size and the effective size of instabilities are close but in aldr the domain size is about tens of meters while the instabilities arise in a layer with thickness of millimeters order rotte et al 2016 stated that the re entrant jet can be modeled with proper rans models but the wave pinch off needs a more advanced model such as les or another scale resolving simulation although some researchers have tried to find a way to simulate instabilities effects in two phase flow with simple and cost worthy rans models there is no successful answer to the writer s knowledge as an example shirani et al 2006 suggested two source terms in momentum and phase transport equations each with a constant coefficient although they showed that their model is capable of predicting more realistic results of overall flow field with proper tuning of coefficients the source term in phase equation results in unrealistic numerical phase change and therefore the mass conservation of each phase is not preserved moreover the coefficients should be tuned for each problem and no closure model was proposed for them also researchers have stated that rans models suffer from high eddy viscosity near the interface of two phases with high density ratio they use the reboud correction which damps the eddy viscosity with the aid of a function of density dasilva 2011 checked several common rans models and showed that some of them need this correction but the sst model doesn t need any reboud correction as it doesn t over predict the eddy viscosity the aim of this study is to determine a strategy for proper numerical simulation of the thin air layer without resorting to complex numerical methods such as les or dns hence the experimental tests of elbing et al 2008 on flat plate are chosen as the validation check points first an investigation is done on different rans turbulence models in section 2 and it is shown that the best model for this problem is the sst model which has the correct overall behavior with respect to change in air injection flow rate then to improve the sst results in section 3 it is shown that the cfd modeling of the problem with the addition of a harmonic perturbation in the boundary condition can lead to more realistic results finally linear stability analysis is introduced in section 4 to determine the required perturbation frequency the final strategy consists of a coupled cfd and orr sommerfeld analysis which seems to yield acceptable results with low computational cost restating the procedure the linear stability analysis is used to find proper estimate of perturbation frequency to avoid the need for checking wide range of perturbation frequencies in cfd simulation then the resulted frequencies could be used in the final cfd simulation 2 simple cfd solution as kim and moin 2010 s dns results show the desirable numerical result should model a continuous air layer al which is created from the injection point and continued to a location downstream depending on the air flux for a low air flux which is not sufficient to make a stable al the al should encounter instabilities and disintegrate into patches of air and bubbles after some distance which is required for instabilities growth this can be seen in kim and moin 2010 air water interface snapshots and also in their skin friction plot they simulated two air fluxes which one is said to be sufficient to make al but the other is less than the required value the higher air flux resulted in a continuous al but the lower air flux resulted in instability growth and disintegration of al in their air water interface shape waves can be seen for both the higher and lower air fluxes while they do not grow in amplitude for the higher air flux but growing waves for the lower air flux finally causes the al disintegration also skin friction coefficient shows that wall shear stress is near zero throughout the simulated domain for high air flux with continuous al but for the lower air flux shear stress remains near zero just up to a distance downstream the injection point and then it gradually grows and the al effect on drag reduction disappears pearce et al 2015 results of experimental air layer formation downstream of a backward step show similar behavior in their results the stable length of al increases by increasing the air flux a similar phenomenon may also be recognized from elbing et al 2008 s experimental results although their claim is different they stated that a critical air flux exists and the air layer cannot be formed for lower air fluxes but al develops to the entire flat plate length for higher values studying their results fig 1 for air fluxes lower than the critical value it can be seen that the drag reduction for sensors closer to the injection slot is higher than sensors further downstream it can be concluded that for air fluxes lower than the critical value the air layer is formed and covers the first initial sensor but further downstream the layer becomes unstable and disintegrates into parts and bubbles thus the drag reduction recorded by other downstream sensors were lowered however a different perception can be drawn from elbing et al 2008 s results similar to their own assertion the high dr which was sensed by the first sensor may be interpreted as high dr for bdr in locations near the injection point in this manner other sensors have sensed low dr due to lower void fraction in the boundary layer sensors except the first one show somewhat similar drag reduction and their dr reaches to high values higher than 80 by the critical air flux almost simultaneously this is in agreement with elbing et al 2008 s claim that a critical air flux exist air fluxes lower than the critical value results in bdr and air fluxes higher than the critical value make aldr with high dr on the entire flat plate although this interpretation may seem to be correct it is not the case that dns results of kim and moin 2010 show if the dns results of kim and moin and experimental results of pearce et al is assumed to be correct the length of the al can be understood from the drag reduction value of different sensors at different positions for example in elbing et al 2008 for 0 02 m 2 s air flux none of the sensors show high drag reduction while for 0 04 m 2 s the first sensor shows high drag reduction but others show only mild values it can be interpreted that for 0 02 m 2 s air flux no air layer is developed up to the location of the first sensor for 0 04 m 2 s air flux an air layer developed and covered the first sensor but it discontinued and did not cover the other sensors and the al disintegrated between the first and second sensors increasing the air flux causes the stable air layer continuation toward downstream longer al results in high dr ratio detected by all of the sensors after 0 08 m 2 s air flux at the first step of numerical modeling a 2 d multiphase cfd simulation of the flow on a flat plate was carried out using vof multiphase model and different turbulence models on a commercial cfd package elbing et al 2008 s experiment was chosen as the reference case for this study the actual size of their cavitation tunnel test section domain was discretized into quadrilateral cells and finite volume solution of the n s equations using second order discretization methods was accomplished air was injected through an inclined slot just the same way as elbing et al 2008 s slot a shape various turbulence models for simulation of this flow were investigated and some of the results are presented here fig 2 and table 1 show the results of these turbulence models for two different air fluxes air water interface shapes in fig 2 and length of continuous al before complete disintegration in table 1 show some important aspects of various turbulence models results regarding the fact that for higher air fluxes the al should remain stable for a longer length along the plate and vice versa the last column of table 1 has been marked by physical non physical to show that the trend of different turbulence models is in agreement with basics of experiments or not here real physics is the fact that for higher air flux the results of air water interface shape should be more stable in fig 2 and length of the al before disintegration should be higher than the lower air flux results if a turbulence model predicts this behavior without any constraints on correct al length in comparison with experimental results it is labeled as physical and any turbulence model that resulted in inverted behavior more stable al and longer al length for lower air flux is labeled as non physical the results in this figure and the table show that except for sst model other predictions are unrealistic the air water interface for 0 02 m 2 s air flux is more stable and smoother than the interface for the higher air flux in k ε rng and k k l ω application but sst model predicts the air water interface for 0 04 m 2 s air flux completely stable and smooth while this is not the case for 0 02 m 2 s air flux which encounters an instability and finally the al disintegrates into parts at about 7 m downstream of the injection point more quantitative form of these results i e disintegration length shown in table 1 emphasizes the same erroneous trend for three turbulence models and correct trend for sst model in contradiction with experimental results as the sst model was the only model that predicted the correct behavior it was chosen as the preferred model for the rest of this study however its prediction of al length is still far from experiments as can be seen in the first row of table 1 for 0 04 m 2 s air flux with completely stable al throughout the surface therefore sst model is not capable of predicting the observed instabilities in experiments and over predicts the drag reduction with a stable air layer which is also reported by wang et al 2010 to ensure the grid independence of the aforementioned results four grids were created as listed in table 2 these grids contain quadrilateral cells with enhanced concentration near the plate wall and uniform distribution in stream wise direction in fig 3 the air layer thickness is plotted for four different numerical grids also normalized velocity is defined as u u 0 where u 0 is the interface velocity and normalized y is defined as d y d where y is the distance from the solid wall and d is the al thickness the normalized velocity profiles of the boundary layer are plotted in fig 4 as it can be concluded from these figures the third grid was chosen as the proper grid this grid was later used to correctly predict the velocity profile as can be seen in fig 3 there are some perturbations at the interface although these perturbations are predicted by the turbulence model by itself their frequency and energy contents are not enough to initiate a sensible instability in the layer in order to have more realistic simulations some modifications are necessary either in turbulence models or in the overall strategy of modeling that is described in the followings in order to provide an extensive view of the results the sst model was applied to four different air fluxes and the results of the air layer thickness are shown in fig 5 as it can be seen the higher the air flux the thicker the air layer all air fluxes resulted in a rapid thickening in al and then they relax the initial thickening is mostly because of air injection direction which has a 12 inclination with flat plate surface it should be noted that the scaling of vertical axis in fig 5 is too much smaller than the horizontal one the slope of the al interface at initial thickening region can be calculated and is about 0 3 the high momentum water flow impacts and mixes with low momentum air flow with an inclined velocity e g about 7 m s for 0 04 m 2 s air flux simple momentum conservation law results in 0 3 final flow direction similar to cfd results after the initial thickening low air fluxes show a reduction in al thickness which is the result of increase in air velocity because of air water interface shear stress higher air fluxes i e 0 05 m 2 s bring about thicker al and hence lower influence of interface shear stresses fig 5 shows that the sst model prediction for the case of 0 02 m 2 s air flux is different from others and it is the only case which encounters instability through 10 m flat plate for this flux the huge variation of al indicates that the layer starts to disintegrate probably into bubbles at the location of about 5 5 m from the injection location however as experimental results show all of the cases in fig 5 must be more unstable and especially for the 0 02 m 2 s air flux case there should be almost no developed air layer development of the al must be accomplished gradually with increasing the air flux upto a critical flux which should result in a continuous developed al on the entire flat plate 3 perturbed cfd simulation the authors of present paper believe that the main shortcoming of rans models specifically the sst model is related to the initial disturbance of the flow and its frequency content noticing that prediction of an al development and possible disintegration location along the flat plate is strongly dependent on the initial disturbance and frequency content large eddy simulations can model the initial perturbed flow by setting different viscosity values of sub grid scale in different cells so there is a different diffusion term in adjacent cells resulting in various flow response that provide required broadband perturbations in contrast the turbulent viscosity of rans models does not vary spatially to a great extent in ordinary flow fields and usually a smooth change is predicted by the differential equation governing turbulence parameters also these models usually include infinitesimal perturbations due to numerical errors but often the simulated perturbations frequency content is not necessarily wide enough and also larger perturbations cannot be seen correctly in rans models due to large turbulent viscosity values that filter out small fluctuations of parameters in the flow field this shortcoming of rans models is resolved to some extent by scale adaptive simulations as they dynamically adjust the resolved structures similar to les behavior in unsteady regions of the flow field menter and egorov 2005 to check the sst capability in modeling of perturbed flow a simple sinusoidal fluctuation was added to the air flow rate and the amplification of this wave downstream of the injection point was checked the fluctuation had a specific frequency which was changed in each case some selected frequencies are reported here to find the effect of any specific frequency on the response of the flow as can be seen in fig 6 the air layer is stable for the simple case without any additional fluctuations but by perturbing the air flow rate the air layer also starts to fluctuate for some injection perturbation frequencies the response of the flow is an amplification in air layer thickness unstable cases but for some other the fluctuation amplitude decreases and tends to zero stable cases or remains at almost constant amplitude marginally stable cases fig 6 shows the response of air layer to the frequency change of perturbations as mentioned before for zero frequency no fluctuation case the interface is smooth and stable increasing the frequency it starts to amplify the perturbations and so the air layer degenerates to fragments and possibly bubbles at the end part of the flat plate further increase of the frequency decreases the continuous air layer length until it reaches its minimum length at a specific frequency here about 200 r a d s beyond this point more increase of frequency results in lower amplification of the perturbation and thus more smooth air layer length at high enough frequencies a return to full stable mode prevails and the air layer continues to the end of flat plate smoothly it should be noted that all of these perturbations were made with the same amplitude about 3 of main flow velocity thus the energy of the added perturbation is higher for higher frequency cases full stable response of the flow in high frequencies high energy perturbations shows that the flow response depends mainly on the perturbation frequency and not on its energy it is worth mentioning that the time step was properly adjusted at each case and especially for higher frequency simulations from these results it may be concluded that the sst model with the addition of a properly constructed frequency wise perturbation in the air flux is the most capable and promising rans turbulence model for prediction of both the stable and unstable behavior at different flow conditions this point would be more substantiated in later sections however as the comparison between simple cfd simulations and experimental results shows cfd simulations using rans models are generally more stable especially in air layer flow addition of proper perturbations would trigger the unstable modes of the main flow and hence the more realistic results would occur in the air water interface reported in kim and moin 2010 it can be seen that there exist waves with different wave lengths at the interface and the growing wave is one of them the results of perturbed flow fig 6 hint that if waves with the correct frequency exists in the flow the present cfd analysis may predict the correct amplification to check the result of the perturbed flow prediction in comparison with experimental results perturbation was added to the air flow rate with many different frequencies and the most unstable cases was extracted and their results will be shown later a question remains to be answered whether the most unstable cfd results is physical or not it can be argued that if a perturbation with the frequency of the most unstable mode happens in the real world this mode is the most capable mode to make the flow unstable and would be the dominant mode far enough downstream for the problem at hand now the question may arise what happens if the most unstable frequency does not occur in a real situation the answer is not so obvious as there are many small perturbation components with different amplitudes and shapes in a real flow some of them can be assumed as periodic perturbations with one or more frequencies while others are not periodic and may be even fully random perturbations as a random perturbation e g white noise contains almost all frequencies in the frequency range it should also include the most unstable frequency and the result may be similar to the most unstable harmonic one to check whether random perturbations can provoke the flow to the same state as the most unstable mode stimulated by harmonic perturbation does white noise was added to the air flow rate instead of harmonic perturbation fig 7 shows the result of white noise perturbation alongside with the most unstable case of the harmonic perturbation in this figure the instantaneous interface shape is plotted as well as the time average of the interface over about 3 s of simulation as it can be seen the white noise also makes the air layer degenerate but it is not as powerful as the harmonic perturbation the averaged interface also shows that the al thickness for harmonic perturbation is less than the thickness for white noise as the air flux is the same for both cases the thinner al means more discrete bubbles and air patches while thicker al means more continuous and contiguous al as the white noise contains almost all frequencies it should degenerate the air layer similar to the harmonically perturbed case but as it can be seen its power in resonance with fluid flow is less than the pure harmonic case which may be due to smaller power share and lack of continuous stimulation in that relevant frequency the best way to check that whether the most unstable case result is what occurs in real world or not is to compare the results with experimental data left part of fig 8 shows this comparison and the results of elbing et al 2008 s and elbing et al 2013 s experiments are plotted alongside current results and wang et al 2010 s cfd ones in this figure the drag reduction percentage is plotted versus nominal air layer thickness which was introduced and used by previous researchers e g jang et al 2014 as a simple parameter of the ratio between 2d air flux and free stream speed as it can be seen there is a considerable improvement in predicting correct drag reduction for different air flow rates in comparison to the previous work published in literature wang et al 2010 as it can be seen wang et al 2010 s results are far from experimental ones especially in critical nominal thickness the minimum nominal air layer thickness for which the drag reduction would be more than 80 but the present study has predicted correct critical nominal air layer another point is that the 2013 and 2008 results of experiment are in agreement with each other these experimental tests have a major difference elbing et al 2008 injected air from a slot directly beneath the flat plate while elbing et al 2013 injected air behind a backward facing step the agreement between these two results show that inserting a back step may not change the flow field significantly as a double check on the perturbed cfd results the elbing et al 2013 s test was also simulated with similar procedure as previous ones results of this simulation are plotted in the right part of fig 8 similar agreement of current results and experimental results of drag reduction with air injection behind a backward facing step is seen in this figure this agreement shows that the proposed procedure can be used in aldr simulation either in simple cases or cases with the use of back step from fig 8 a limitation of the perturbed flow analysis results is the correct computation of the drag reduction in low air flow rates with nominal air layer thickness of less than 4 m m where there is no continuous stable air layer and the drag reduction is mostly due to bubbles and air patches this transition region contains all the air layers air patches large bubbles and small bubbles simultaneously this region is more complicated than the bdr or aldr alone regions the bdr region only contains small bubbles and as murai 2014 pointed is the easiest mode of air lubrication method for numerical modeling because it can be modeled in a single phase manner with either dispersed bubbles or mixture method on the other hand aldr alone is a stable two phase flow similar to simple free surface problems all the instabilities and large number of coalescence and breakup of bubbles and air pockets are present mostly in the transitional region usually ensued from unstable behavior of aldr a simple urans modeling of this problem results in a very stable air layer without enough breakups as wang et al 2010 also showed but the proposed perturbation can bring in some breakups to the flow and provides more conformity with the experiments however it is not far from expectation as rans model on such a numerical grid are not successful in correct prediction of interactions of the bubbles vibrations and water flow in boundary layer as an example of one of the difficulties the existence of large bubbles in boundary layer for flow rates with nominal air layer thickness of about 2 m m can be mentioned murai 2014 showed that large bubbles inside the boundary layer can lead to drag increase instead of decrease but modeling these bubble vibrations and deformations and their interaction with the base water flow is not in the range of rans modeling thus the predicted drag reduction is higher than experimental results in these regions although the drag reduction in low air flux regions is not predicted correctly the critical air flux and nominal thickness is predicted correctly as it is evident in fig 8 current results are in more agreement in all regions even in low air flux regions with experimental results than wang et al 2010 s results which are the results of simple cfd simulations another interesting point in fig 8 is that aldr simulations are done for both u 11 1 and 6 7 m s free stream velocities in this figure the numerical results of these two cases are in high agreement with each other this may be interpreted as the nominal air layer thickness can be used to scale the problem for different free stream velocities in other words from the numerical results it comes to mind that finding the drag reduction of different air fluxes in a specific free stream velocity can be used for other free stream velocity by the usage of nominal air layer thickness using the nominal air layer thickness q a u emphasizes a linear dependence of the required air flux on freestream velocity this is not in agreement with elbing et al 2008 s results that a dependence on second power of free stream is shown also elbing et al 2013 used some analytical calculation and found that the critical air flux should depend on friction velocity u τ and then using different data of their own experimental test and elbing et al 2008 s ones they found that air flux dependence on friction velocity is about u τ 1 8 if the one seventh law turbulent velocity profile is assumed for flat plate elbing et al 2013 s result shows that the critical flow rate depends on velocity as u 1 67 there is a point here elbing et al 2008 and elbing et al 2013 tried to find the dependence of critical air flux on free stream velocity but here the present method result shows an agreement between drag reductions of flow at least for two different free stream velocities in different air fluxes including transitional aldr these two different approaches produce rather similar results but they are not exactly the same dependence of required air flux for a specific drag reduction on free stream velocity can be different for bdr transitional aldr and full aldr in order to provide a more complete validation with experimental results velocity and void fraction distributions were compared to elbing et al 2013 s results the numerical simulation was carried out on the geometry and test conditions of that paper as the numerical simulation shows a highly time dependent and fluctuating properties the time averaged properties were also used as a comparison variable with experimental results fig 9 presents this comparison both in velocity distribution left and void fraction right as can be seen elbing et al 2013 reported liquid and interface velocities independently the liquid velocity profile where the void fraction is relatively low was measured with ldv and the interface velocity profile where the void fraction is not too low or too high was measured with time of flight tof sensors tof sensors can measure the velocity of the interface between the air and water and they suffer from relatively high errors in regions without enough distinguished interfaces like pure air and pure water regions elbing et al 2013 stated that the velocity profile in aldr consists of three parts a a nearly constant velocity region inside the al with velocity magnitude of about 20 of free stream velocity b a nearly linear buffer layer and c a power law profile similar to no injection profile in regions with low void fraction however a constant velocity profile with 20 of freestream velocity magnitude inside the al for any air flux seems strange physically also the measured interface velocity at y δ 0 4 δ is no injection boundary layer thickness where the ldv sensor has also measured the velocity does not have a complete agreement with ldv results this may be because of tof sensor errors or void fraction effects on ldv fig 9 shows that the present numerical results match the liquid velocity profile but the interface velocity distribution is different to some extent if the experimental interface velocity is multiplied by a constant value to have a better agreement between tof and ldv sensors in common regions the agreement between cfd results and experimental ones would be better the right part of fig 9 shows the void fraction distribution of the present numerical study and elbing et al 2013 elbing et al 2013 stated that the reported void fraction for regions closer than y δ 0 1 where the void fraction is near unity is more than 10 uncertain about 15 but in regions with lower void fraction the uncertainty is less than 10 fig 9 shows an agreement on void fraction distribution between present cfd simulation and elbing et al 2013 results in most regions elbing et al 2013 s result near the wall have lower void fraction which seems to be non physical these strange values should be produced by the sensor errors as the void fraction inside the al should be near unity also shown by numerical simulation 4 linear stability analysis up to this point a trick has been applied to extract proper results from numerical modeling of thin air layer however another problem arises that one should examine a vast range of perturbation frequencies to find the most unstable one also while sweeping the frequencies of perturbations from small values to a large value that the flow returns to its stable mode there is no guarantee that no other larger frequency exists for which the flow might be in more unstable mode the standard way around this problem is to check the unstable mode frequencies via a linear stability analysis in literature there are many studies on linear and fewer on non linear stability analysis for different flow problems in two phase stability problems most researchers prefer to mainly distinguish stable from unstable cases without any special interest in determining flow field in the unstable cases they mostly solve two phase orr sommerfeld equation to find out if there is any unstable mode yih 1967 showed that the viscosity stratification in plane couette flow causes instabilities for any reynolds number some researchers worked on liquid layer in gas domain which may happen in condensation of vapor on the walls of large diameter pipes and channels miesen and boersma 1995 boomkamp et al 1997 many other worked on plane or round jet of liquid injected into air domain and its breakup mahdavi et al 2013 soderberg 2003 kim and moin 2010 studied linear stability of air layer alongside dns of the flow they showed the conformity of two different methods i e for the case that the dns results in a stable flow the linear stability analysis also shows stability and for unstable case in dns linear stability analysis also predicts unstable modes to perform a linear stability analysis on air layer problem fig 10 the non dimensional navier stokes equations were written for the base flow then full perturbed navier stokes equations were written and equations governing the base flow were subtracted from them to obtain equations for the perturbation terms assuming small perturbations the second power of perturbations in the relevant set of equations can be neglected and the equations would be simplified the simplified non dimensionalized momentum equations of the perturbed terms can be written as in equation 1 1 x x d y y d t τ d u 0 u u u 0 v v u 0 p p ρ j u 0 2 u u u v v v p p p u u u v v v p p p u τ u u x u u x v u y v u y ρ j ρ p x ν ν j ℜ

variables of the gas jet air layer and uppercases are the base flow non perturbed variables introducing the stream function of perturbations ψ for the gas jet part and ϕ for the liquid part and writing them in exponential form the momentum equations combine into a single ordinary differential equation if the y velocity v and the stream wise derivative of parameters could be neglected the

conditions at this interface can be obtained from no slip and no penetration conditions another condition can be obtained from shear stress equality at two sides of the interface and finally the condition that the difference between normal stresses of two sides of the interface is equal to the surface tension gives the fourth boundary condition these equations are listed in equation 4

boundary conditions of no slip and no penetration at both the solid wall and a virtual free stream wall at the other side as is shown in fig 10 the needed eight boundary conditions of the two phase forth order differential equation are obtained orr sommerfeld equation with these boundary conditions cannot be solved analytically and must be solved numerically as many researchers mentioned for a highly accurate solution of this equation in order to resolve unstable modes chebyshev polynomials should be used orszag 1971 thus the numerical solution of the equation using chebyshev polynomials was carried out kim and moin 2010 used linear and parabolic velocity profiles as the base flow in their stability analysis however they focused mostly on linear two phase fully developed couette flow profile like many other authors some other researchers used more real piecewise linear or fully non linear velocity profiles as the base velocity in their linear stability analysis in analysis of thin liquid layer in adjacency of moving gas environment miesen and boersma 1995 and boomkamp et al 1997 used a linear velocity profile for the liquid layer near the wall two part piecewise linear profile for the gas domain velocity was used by miesen et al while boomkamp et al employed a more realistic profile which includes a linear viscous sublayer and a special hyperbolic tangent form for the rest of boundary layer which miles 1962 had introduced as an empirical wind velocity profile boomkamp et al stated that the effective part of the gas domain velocity profile is the linear viscous sub layer and the curvature of the gas flow velocity profile does not have significant effect on the stability of the flow one of the most advanced velocity profile is used by söderberg and alfredsson 1998 and soderberg 2003 who studied the liquid plane jet breakup and used a velocity profile similar to the stokes first problem equation 5 for the gas domain and a velocity profile extracted from cfd simulations for the liquid jet the idea of using a velocity profile similar to the stokes first problem seems to be interesting as it is simple and also can become an accurate boundary layer profile over a flat plate 5 u u 0 e r f y 2 ν t u u 0 e r f y 2 u 0 ν x it can be shown that this velocity profile with the addition of a constant coefficient here a value about π 2 can become similar to the well known blasius velocity profile of the flow on a flat plate fig 11 shows the blasius profile and a modified stokes profile u u 0 e r f y π u 0 ν x pay attention to the additional π in the error function argument which does not exist in stokes first problem solution this agreement hints that with addition of a constant this velocity profile interpolates closely a physical boundary layer profile in flat plate case the velocity that is used in conversion of stokes solution from time dependent to a space dependent one is the free stream velocity which is constant and convects the data from upstream to downstream söderberg and alfredsson 1998 and soderberg 2003 used this velocity profile as the environment velocity near the jet in that case as the interface velocity changes by location the velocity which was used to convert time to space was not really constant however in cases that the change in velocity is small in comparison with boundary layer growth rate no significant error is expected but implementing any analysis with hypothesis of constant velocity in stream wise direction should be avoided in regions with large stream wise changes of variables in comparison with changes of variables in lateral direction thus the regions near the jet nozzle should not be used for these analysis this velocity profile is used here in a more complicated form as described in following in order to improve solution accuracy it was decided to set a velocity profile similar to the real one in present study keeping in mind the stokes first problem solution and its agreement with blasius boundary layer profile a template of the velocity profile is introduced in equation 6 this template is a summation of three boundary layer profiles similar to equation 5 with additional constant coefficients also the template was written such that the velocity meets the no slip at solid wall for jet layer profile virtual free stream wall for environmental profile and air water interface conditions by its own however this template is just a template and any other form of velocity functions can be used to simulate the real velocity profile the main advantage of this profile over an arbitrary velocity function e g polynomials is that it originates from physics and it should match better with real profile with less tuning coefficients some general functions e g polynomials which may be used here in curve fitting suffer from non physical fluctuations which may cause non physical modes from linear stability analysis also the difference of using velocity profiles similar to real one with simplified linear profile is shown later in fig 14 6 u j e t u m 1 e r f d y 2 μ j c 1 x ρ j u m e r f d 2 μ j c 1 x ρ j u m u m u 0 u m 1 e r f y 2 μ j c 2 x ρ j u m u 0 e r f d 2 μ

boundary layer growth on the interface fig 10 both with a profile similar to equation 5 the wall side boundary layer uses a mean velocity u m which is not necessarily the average of velocity in the gas region but a velocity that propagates the information through that region and should be evaluated later the boundary layer of the interface side uses the difference between the interface velocity u 0 and u m on the other hand the water velocity profile environment region also consists of two parts a thick boundary layer which is due to the pre injection wall effect and a thin boundary layer due to the difference between the interface velocity and the velocity due to the first part in order to satisfy all boundary conditions and also continuity of the gas layer met two additional conditions were set firstly for the continuity the integral of the jet region velocity profile should be equal to the injection flow rate and secondly for shear stress equality the slope of the velocity profiles on either sides of interface should be proportional to inverse of the viscosity ratio solving for these two conditions mean velocity of the jet region u m and interface induced velocity slope in environment u p would be obtained as all boundary layers thickness mentioned above vary with location x proper localized values should be used in the analysis also the velocity profile contains some parameters such as u m u 0 and air layer thickness that are not constant from the injection point to any downstream point just like the boundary layer thickness as these variables do not change the same way as the boundary layer the profile cannot estimate the real profile automatically by just setting the proper x value therefore some constant coefficients were placed as calibration coefficients for each term and are shown as c i in equation 6 to have a good curve fit of the mentioned profile with cfd velocity results one can adjust these coefficients c i to produce a near best fit as mentioned before and also as soderberg 2003 has used this analysis is acceptable for cases with minor change of the flow parameters in stream wise direction thus this should not be used in regions with high deformation of interface or where the velocity profile changes a lot having such a complex velocity profile template it can be used to fit any realistic profile of the problem in hand as mentioned above the cfd solution of this flow without artificial fluctuations shows an almost stable and smooth air layer which can be a good choice as the base flow in stability analysis therefore a full cfd simulation was carried out without any artificial fluctuations in order to capture the base flow air layer thickness and velocity profiles the velocity profiles of cfd solutions at different locations are plotted in fig 12 in this figure the velocity and y coordinate are normalized the same way as done before in fig 4 as can be seen there is a significant difference between these results with simple linear profile however it must be mentioned that the velocity profile tends to linear profile gradually as proceeding downstream but for the case of interest the length of the flat plate is not enough for a fully developed air layer close to the injection location the change in velocity profile and air layer thickness is not so small but as the air flows downstream the slope of change in velocity and al thickness decreases and reaches a small value such that its derivative with respect to x can be neglected in such regions the equation might be solved as was done by soderberg 2003 to satisfy linear stability conditions the numerical cfd results are fitted by profiles with the shape presented in equation 6 also for fine tuning four calibration constant values were manually set to have the best fit fig 13 shows the cfd results and the fitted profiles for different x locations as can be seen the template was fitted to cfd results in different downstream locations with completely different velocity profiles and just small difference is left between fitted curve and cfd results e g the slope at wall is less than cfd results in this figure the velocity is normalized by friction velocity u τ and y is normalized as y d l where l ν u τ is friction length scale friction velocity and length scale are extracted from cfd simulation at appropriate downstream location for each plot in this figure setting the base velocities in the linear stability analysis code the spectrum of stability would be obtained which is shown for one of the studied cases in fig 14 as can be seen there are two unstable modes that one of them has normalized phase speed c ω k greater than 1 and the other less than 1 as the velocities were normalized by the interface velocity value the normalized value greater than 1 means that the phase speed is greater than the interface velocity and this mode is named the interface mode as called by miles 1957 the other mode with normalized phase velocity smaller than 1 and is the internal mode having a look at the results it can be seen that the growth ratio of the interfacial mode is about an order of magnitude larger than the internal mode although one may assume that the most unstable mode of a flow extracted from stability analysis would be dominant in flow some researchers have stated that it is not necessarily the dominant mode of flow in some problems such as the present one there may be more than one unstable mode in the results of the analysis in such cases for two phase jet flows there may exist many different instabilities which boomkamp et al 1997 listed some of them in this problem the two modes seem to originates from different flow effects the internal mode is due to combination of both viscosity induced instabilities at the interface and reynolds stresses in the jet layer the other unstable mode the interface mode which mostly arises due to tangential disturbances because of viscosity change between phases and usually lies in the environment viscous sublayer when both modes are unstable for one frequency it is said that the internal mode is usually dominant even when its instability power is an order of magnitude lower than the interfacial mode miesen and boersma 1995 boomkamp et al 1997 in fig 14 the results of the analysis with the aid of aforementioned velocity profiles are plotted alongside the analysis with a simple linear velocity profile to find the effect and importance of the correct velocity profile application as can be seen the linear profile results into a strong large growth ratio internal mode with a very weak interfacial mode but conversely the present velocity profile result has a strong interfacial and weak internal mode the more remarkable difference is in frequency space if the spectrum is plotted with perturbation frequency as x axis the linear and nonlinear velocity profiles produce considerably different results where linear internal mode has a peak at 1100 r a d s but nonlinear one has its peak at about 400 r a d s as these profiles make completely different results and logically the more real profile should be more correct one it seems that these plots show the importance of the nonlinear velocity profile usage also to ensure that these results are independent of implemented chebyshev modes number the applied modes both in jet and environment regions denoted by j and e subscripts were varied according to table 3 and the solution spectrum was plotted for each one in fig 15 here sufficient number of chebyshev modes seems to be 25 for jet region and 50 for the environment using these number of modes the stability spectrum is plotted for a few air fluxes in case of 11 1 m s water free stream velocity in fig 16 in this figure the decrease in growth rate of instability is seen by increasing the air flux in compliance with the experimental results an interesting point is that the stability analysis shows a similar behavior of stability instability in comparison with the cfd results both predict almost no instability in non perturbed case zero frequency and reach a most unstable mode in a specific frequency of perturbation and finally return to a stable flow for high enough frequencies both the linear stability spectrum with nonlinear base velocity profile and cfd results for different air flux fluctuation frequencies are plotted in fig 17 both results cfd and linear stability analysis show the same physical trends the higher the air flux the more stable the air layer according to cfd results the lowest air flux produces the least stable air layer length and increasing the air flux causes longer stable air layer in relation to stability analysis both the interfacial mode and the internal mode show such a behavior and the most unstable mode of the flow for 0 04 m 2 s air flux has the largest growth rate in comparison with results related to higher air fluxes also as miesen and boersma 1995 mentioned although the growth rate of the interfacial mode is an order of magnitude larger than the internal mode the internal mode seems to be the dominant mode when both internal and interfacial instabilities are present this is seen when comparing the critical frequency of perturbed cfd and stability analysis here the frequency of interfacial mode is higher and far from cfd results but the frequency of internal mode is closer to the cfd predicted values the cfd results in this figure show the disintegration point of air layer for different air fluxes with different perturbation frequencies total flat plate length in this study is 12 5 m air layer length of cases without disintegration of al is reported as 12 5 m in fig 17 however air layer of unstable modes with the growing perturbations may not finally disintegrate in the studied numerical domain equal to total flat plate length of 12 5 m as an example the case with 0 06 m2 s air flux and 500 rad s perturbation frequency shown in fig 6 indicates very large growth in perturbation amplitude and finally reaches a somewhat constant amplitude in some downstream distance but no disintegration happens therefore in fig 17 the continuous al length for this case is seen to be equal to the total plate length despite that this case is not really fully stable this point results in some apparent inconsistencies of linear stability results with cfd ones in fig 17 fig 17 reconfirms the overall proposed procedure the desired procedure of numerical simulation should be a perturbed cfd simulation which uses the linear stability analysis for estimation of the proper frequency of perturbations the proper critical frequency is the frequency with the highest growth power however in cases where the internal and interfacial modes are present simultaneously the internal mode is usually the dominant mode this procedure can lead to simulation results which are in good agreement with experimental tests results see fig 8 5 discussion thin air layer formation under a flat plate was simulated using cfd urans turbulence model that is perturbed with the proper frequency at inlet boundary condition fig 8 shows very good agreement of the present results compared with experimental drag reduction ratios for different air fluxes however fig 17 shows fair agreement between the predicted unstable frequencies from linear stability analysis and cfd ones which means that the stability analysis could be used to find the proper perturbation frequency in cfd simulations as the drag reduction ratios and the void fraction distribution predicted by the present method are similar to the experimental results and the water velocity distribution is also in agreement with measured values it can be inferred that the present combined method of flow modeling is an acceptable simulation of the real physics of the phenomenon as mentioned before correct numerical simulations of physics may clarify some aspects of the problem that have not been thoroughly studied or uncovered by experimental tests additionally although the main purpose of this study is to determine the critical air flux for any desirable water speed preferably with a low cost cfd simulation it shows some important subjects involved in the real world of applications as explained in the following in previous experimental tests by different researchers the main focus was on the measurement of shear force the sensors measure the wall shear force which is just one aspect of the problem but these sensors show nothing about the mechanism of the shear reduction although some researchers have used photography and void fraction sensors for their tests because of very thin and sensitive air layer measurement of different flow quantities inside the thin air layer is not so straight forward moreover in the present study the shear stress on the wall is simulated with good accuracy but the flow field is different from the previous researchers claims elbing et al 2008 and jang et al 2014 claim that the aldr is a state that the air flux is sufficiently high and the layer is developed throughout the flat plate or hull as of their opinion when the sufficient air flux forms the air layer the layer continues to the end of the plate unless the side edge leakage causes the degeneration of the layer this conclusion is drawn mostly by the results of the shear sensors in their studies they have seen that after a critical air flux the drag reduction sensed by the sensors are almost constant in different locations in the present study the proposed numerical simulation shows the air layer development for vast range of air flux but with different continuous length for lower air flux the air layer disintegrates into parts and bubbles after a small distance downstream of injection point but for higher air flux the degeneration point is shifted further downstream the interesting point is that for low air flux the disintegrated air layer causes a mild drag reduction which is seen in experimental tests results and named as the transitional region but for sufficiently high air flux the air layer makes the wall shear stress to vanish before the degeneration point and continues to have high drag reduction ratio even after the layer disintegration this may be due to high void fraction in the wall adjacency owing to large air pockets and bubbles in this region the drag reduction is such that distinguishing between clean air layer and bubbly region with lots of air pockets and bubbles may not be easy by the use of shear stress sensors it is an important result that in present study numerical simulations show that the al has experienced instabilities and the disintegration has been occurred in most cases for different air fluxes after sufficiently large distance downstream of injection point hence in real size problems such as large ship hulls with much larger dimensions than the flat plates in laboratories the problem should be simulated to check whether the al experiences instabilities disintegration and a gradual decrease in dr or maintains its high dr throughout the hull because of gradual change in velocity profiles downstream and change in stability characteristics of the flow it might be imagined that an al may not disintegrate even at very large downstream distances although 3d main flow and real world perturbations in case of ship sailing make this situation rather hypothetical as mentioned earlier rotte et al 2016 stated that there are two main mechanisms which cause the instabilities in aldr the interface waves and the re entrant jet in present study the interface wave effect is investigated the results show that the interface waves and their growth due to their instabilities can lead to air layer rupture for thin air layers they claimed that the source of wave creation is mostly the turbulence that generates waves with wavelengths of few centimeters in this study it is shown i e in fig 18 that the proper perturbations which lead to the most unstable case have larger wavelengths about 10 40 cm which is called the critical wavelength here fig 18 shows the air layer thickness for the most unstable perturbed flow for three different air fluxes as it can be seen the air layer shape seems not to be a pure sinusoidal profile with an exponential amplification analyzing these layer shapes show that the perturbations are amplified in exponential manner which is stronger larger amplification power for lower air flux and weaker for higher air flux but the profile of the air layer seems to be more complicated than a pure sine wave fig 19 shows the fourier transform of these waves it shows that for all of these three cases the wave has a main frequency which is the frequency that the flow is perturbed by call it critical frequency but there are other frequencies mostly other harmonics of the critical frequency plus some other frequencies that act as a role to form these waves these waves have smaller wavelengths than the critical wavelength and can have more significant interactions with turbulence it seems that the perturbation with critical frequency provokes some other frequencies and these waves make the layer disruption altogether in fig 6 the cases with high frequencies show sine like waves and are almost stable or marginally stable although the energy of the perturbation is higher for high frequencies even when the wave amplitude grows and reaches a large value finally it becomes almost marginally stable these waves with pure sine like shape do not have enough strength to make the layer rupture in contrast lower perturbation frequencies show waves with shapes of more complex form and have amplitude peaks in more than one frequencies in their fourier transform these cases lead to instabilities and the waves amplitude grow until the layer rupture occurs 6 conclusion air layer drag reduction seems to be one of the interesting drag reduction methods for application on large ships previous experimental works show that there is a critical air flux which is the minimum air flux that may sustain the air layer the amount of the air flux and methods for reducing this critical air flux is the main goal of most studies on aldr there are some experimental test results to clarify the physics of this type of air lubrication method but as makiharju and ceccio 2018 mentioned the critical air flux limits that has been proposed by previous researchers are not complete they have shown that in some cases although the air flux is more than the critical amount predicted by scaling methods of elbing et al 2013 the air layer does not establish also there are cases that the air flux is less than the predicted critical value but the air layer is formed understanding the physics of such a phenomenon by the aid of experimental tests is usually difficult and in these cases the numerical modeling would help the researchers as this flow encounters two phase instabilities due to high viscosity ratio and density stratification it cannot be modeled with simple urans turbulence models on a not so dense numerical grid which is usually used in practical problems rotte et al 2016 stated that modeling this instability with simple urans models is hard and needs more advanced turbulence models to have an acceptable flow solution for such problems with a low enough numerical cost for real size application numerical costs of the urans order a new strategy is introduced first some common turbulence models were checked and the sst model showed as the best one to predict the overall behavior of the flow at the next step it was shown that with the addition of some periodic artificial perturbation the sst model can predict amplification of the perturbed flow in some cases also a linear stability analysis with non linear base velocity profile obtained from cfd simulation was carried out it was shown that the most unstable mode of flow in cfd simulations occurs at the same frequency as that of the linear stability analysis predictions as a result the new procedure of numerical solution of thin air layer modeling is concluded as follows 1 do a full cfd modeling of the case with vof multiphase model and sst turbulence model on a proper numerical grid 2 extract the air layer thickness and velocity profile of the flow from the cfd results of step 1 and perform a curve fit of the velocity with a profile similar to equation 6 3 solve the two phase orr sommerfeld equation with the base flow velocity results of step 2 and find the frequency of the most unstable mode 4 do another full cfd modeling similar to step 1 with an addition of the air injection fluctuation with the frequency obtained from step 3 as the final and verifying step the numerical results of such simulations show good agreement with experimental reports in drag reduction ratios for different air flux values and also the velocity and void fraction distribution and are much more accurate than common simple cfd simulations using urans models previous urans modeling of such problem has shown about 80 error in prediction of critical nominal air layer thickness wang et al 2010 while the present method shows only about 10 error meanwhile such an improvement in accuracy of numerical modeling does not cost a lot the present method costs only twice as a simple urans two phase cfd simulation as there are two cfd simulation steps in the procedure also note that the computational cost of linear stability analysis is negligible compared to cfd simulations the numerical cost of the present method is much lower than advanced methods such as les and dns as an example kim and moin 2010 carried out their dns of aldr on a domain of just about 40 cm long and only 1 8 m s free stream velocity with more than 270 million 3d computational cells which needs a huge computer resource while the present results on a 15 m long domain with 11 1 m s free stream velocity were done on a grid with less than 500 thousands of 2d computational cells therefore the required cpu time for the solution of the dns case is more than 500 times more than the present requirement the present method gives the results for a typical case in about one day on a conventional pc with 6 core cpu thus it can be used as a common low cost numerical procedure to have acceptable predictions of the aldr in any similar cases 
22867,electrochemical chloride extraction ece is one of the key ways to enhance the durability of concrete structure which suffered or are suffering from chloride attack to deeply understand the influence of various factors on chlorine removal efficiency this paper presents a numerical study to characterize transport and distribution of each ion during ece a plain concrete specimen was used as an example to investigate the influence of various factors on the efficiency of ece of one side anode these factors were time current density ratio of cover thickness and side length initial chloride ion concentration and ratio of cross sectional area of reinforcement to cross sectional area of specimen in addition the quantitative relationship model between these factors and total electrochemical desalination efficiency are also proposed good agreement between the present the quantitative relationship model of total desalination efficiency and the fem solution illustrates reliability and accuracy of the proposed relationship model keywords desalination chloride electrochemical chloride extraction ece finite element method 1 introduction corrosion of steel in concrete is recognized as the major source leading to deterioration of reinforced concrete rc structures yeih et al 2006 sergi et al 1992 shi et al 2012 in general a passive film surrounds the steel in concrete and keeps it in a stable state as soon as sufficient chlorine ions in case of sufficient oxygen will induce steel pitting corrosion when this starts it will affect structural safety stability and design service life therefore attention is focused on repairing and retrofitting of reinforced concrete structures that have been contaminated by chloride so far the remediation technology for chloride corroded concrete is mainly divided into traditional physical repair techniques such as the patch repair method and non traditional electrochemical repair technologies such as cathodic protection cp and electrochemical chloride extraction ece siegwart et al 2005 traditional physical repair technology cannot completely remove the chloride ions in the concrete and easily form a novel potential difference in the new patch thus accelerating corrosion of the built in steel weyers et al 1993 currently non traditional electrochemical repair technologies are widely used and cp utilizes an external electric current to change the potential of steel bars thus effectively inhibiting the corrosion of steel however the technology needs to be energized during the entire service life of the structure which comes at a higher cost liu et al 2009 ece has a higher current density than cp creating an electric field between rebar and external anode moving negative ions such as chloride ions toward the anodic electrolyte during a comparatively short period of time typically 4 8 weeks a significant reduction in chloride ions in concrete structures can be achieved at low cost fajardo et al 2006 laboratory tests have been conducted to investigate effectiveness and efficiency of ece e g swamy and mchugh 2006 examined effectiveness and structural implications of ece applied to reinforced concrete beams containing chlorides and reactive aggregates orellan et al 2004 verified the effectiveness of ece and possible formation of new phases in both concrete and steel interfaces garcés et al 2006 reported that the efficiency of ece depends on the arrangement of reinforcing bars saraswathy et al 2018 examined the effect of ece of chloride contaminated concrete consisting of embedded rebar in corroded condition was assessed by measuring the corrosion rate and rebar potential after the ece treatment at three different current density and by using three types of anodes experiments are an effective means to solve ece but experiments are time consuming cost intensive and most important individual effects of various factors are difficult to determine due to interactions between different factors liu et al 2014 with the development of computer technology an increasing number of researchers have begun to use numerical simulation models to investigate the transport behavior of multi species in concrete these models are based on the nernst planck equation e g wang et al 2001 combined the porous media theory and has proposed a two dimensional computer model to simulate chloride removal from concrete liu et al 2014 has presented a three phase numerical model to investigate the performance and efficiency of ece treatment feng et al 2016 proposed a 2 dimensional 2 phase computer model with a surface charge and revealed some important features of surface charge on the concentration distribution of individual ionic species liu et al 2018 treated concrete as a three phase composite including mortar aggregates and interfacial transition zone itz and through numerical analysis some important features about the effect of aggregate shape has been revealed mao et al 2019 numerically evaluated the efficiency of the impregnation of lithium ions and the removal of chloride ions through ece treatment as a technique the effectiveness efficiency and economy of ece should be of concern and is associated with a variety of factors however the effect of various factors on the efficiency of ece remains unclear using existing experiments or numerical simulations the efficiency of ece has not been studied extensively and the quantitative relationship between ece desalting efficiency and influencing factors remains unknown in this study a plain concrete specimen was used as an example the distribution of each ion in the process of ece was numerically solved using a finite element method built in commercial finite element software the influence of time current density ratio of cover thickness and side length initial concentration of chloride ion ratio of cross sectional area of reinforcement to the cross sectional area of specimen on the efficiency of ece of one side anode were investigated furthermore the quantitative relationship model between total electrochemical desalination efficiency and these factors is presented 2 theoretical foundation for ece since the electrochemical reaction 1 leads to the reduction of o h in the electrolyte the ph value of the solution decreases consequently ece treatment sets the surface of the concrete specimen with electrolyte of c a o h 2 orellan et al 2004 or l i o h mo et al 2003 moreover the metal mesh is used as anode in the electrolyte and the reinforced steel is used as cathode in the concrete the applied electric field is applied between anode and cathode and the original chloride ions move to the external anode electrolyte while positive ions move towards the built in reinforcement and this reinforcement produces negative ion o h via cathodic reaction which is beneficial for the re passivation of steel as shown in fig 1 polder 1996 bertolini et al 1996 ihekwaba et al 1996 elsener and angst 2007 during ece treatment the following electrochemical reactions occur at the anode liu et al 2014 wang et al 2001 1 4 o h 2 h 2 o o 2 4 e 2 2 h 2 o 4 h o 2 4 e 3 h c l h c l and at the cathode liu et al 2014 wang et al 2001 4 2 h 2 o o 2 4 e 4 o h 5 2 h 2 o 2 e 2 o h h 2 the transport of ionic species can be expressed by equations of mass conservation ionic flow current conservation and electroneutrality condition as follows allen and larry 1980 6 c i t j i 7 j i d i c i z i u i f c i 8 i f i 1 n z i j i 9 i 1 n z i c i 0 where c i is the concentration of ionic species t is the time

f i 1 n z i d i c i i 1 n z i 2 d i c i in summary when boundary conditions and initial conditions are known the problem of the transport of each ion in the saturated medium can be solved via equations 9 12 and 13 which has been widely used and verified liu et al 2012 2014 feng et al 2016 hassanein et al 2013 3 numerical simulation in order to simulate the ece process a plain concrete specimen 100 mm 100 mm with built in reinforcement with a 5 mm radius was desalted for eight weeks prior to investigation a total of 27 groups case01 case44 of data were selected for comparison detailed parameters see table 1 the base case case13 configuration represents the control and one bar of 5 mm radius was centrally spaced in the specimen as depicted in fig 1 initially the specimen was saturated with a solution of five ionic species potassium sodium chloride hydroxyl and calcium liu et al 2012 2014 2015 li and page 2000 externally a constant direct current dc was applied between reinforcing steel bars and an anode placed on the left side of the specimen while the remaining three sides were no flux the basic settings of the five individual ionic species used in the simulation are listed in table 2 wang et al 2001 the finite element software was used to simulate the transport of each ion in saturated media under ece treatment to increase data convergence and accuracy we used extremely finer free meshing in finite element meshing making the following assumptions 1 concrete is considered homogeneous 2 it doesn t consider ion convection 3 it doesn t consider the combination of the ion and the reaction between ions 4 the pore solution in concrete was saturated dilute solution 5 the flux of hydroxyl ions at the cathode equals the externally applied current density 4 simulation results and discussions the purpose of ece treatment was to discharge the chloride ions in concrete as much as possible astm stand 2005 while reducing reinforcement around c l o h hausmann 1967 mehta and monteiro 1993 therefore in this paper two indicators were selected to reflect the efficiency of ece treatment the removal rate of overall chloride ion across the whole geometry domain after ece treatment ra was defined as 14 p c 0 c t c 0 where c 0 denotes the chloride concentration across the whole geometry domain before ece treatment m o l m and c t denotes the chloride concentration across the whole geometry domain after ece treatment m o l m notice that c 0 and c t is calculated via integrating the chloride ion concentration m o l m 3 across the whole geometry domain m 2 decrease rate of c l o h in front of the bar da 15 t t 0 t t t 0 where t 0 denotes decreased rate of c l o h in front of the bar before ece treatment t t denotes decreased rate of c l o h in front of the bar after ece treatment numerous factors influence the efficiency of ece treatment according to published literature ihekwaba et al 1996 arya et al 1996 liu et al 2012 b and ann 2016 pérez et al 2010 thus this study investigated the influence of these key factors time current density ratio of cover thickness and side length initial concentration of chloride ion and ratio of cross sectional area of reinforcement to the cross sectional area of specimen on the efficiency of ece of one side anode utilizing the finite element method built in commercial finite element software furthermore the quantitative relationship between total electrochemical desalination efficiency and these factors was presented 4 1 effect of time in a very short period of time typically 4 8 weeks ece treatment can achieve a significant reduction of chloride ions in concrete structures at low cost fajardo et al 2006 to investigate the effect of time on the efficiency of ece treatment we designed case 01 to case 08 details are listed in table 1 as is shown in fig 2 and fig 3 a the chloride ion content in the cross section of the specimen decreases with increasing time additionally fig 4 a reveals that the chloride ion content in the steel bars sharply decreased in the early stage of ece treatment and the degree of decrease of chloride ion content surrounding the rebar gradually decreased in the middle and late period of ece treatment these results are consistent with the work of liu et al 2012 and arya et al 1996 the main reason for this phenomenon is that the transport number of ions is higher in the initial stage of ece treatment which is caused by the higher chloride ion concentration in the initial stage of ece treatment consequently chloride ion content around the steel declined sharply in the initial stage of ece treatment with the passage of time the concentration of hydroxide ions in the cathode reinforcement increased while the transport number of ions decreased due to a decrease in chloride ion content across the specimen fig 3b reveals a sharp decrease to a minimum value of the amount of hydroxide ions in the cross section of specimen in the initial stage of ece treatment followed by a gradual increase of the amount of hydroxide ions in the cross section of specimen the main reason for this phenomenon is that in the initial stage of ece treatment the amount of hydroxide ions in the cross section of the specimen rapidly migrated to the anode and thus the amount of hydroxide ions in the cross section of specimen decreased sharply in the later period of ece treatment the amount of hydroxide ions in the cathode reinforcement increased and the transport number of hydroxide ions decreased due to the observed decrease of hydroxide ion content across the specimen thus during the late period of ece treatment the amount of hydroxide ions in the cross section of specimen slightly increases fig 4b also reveals that in the initial stage of ece treatment the content of hydroxide ions around the reinforcing steel sharply increases with passing time the degree of hydroxide ion concentration around the steel bar growth gradually slowed down after 30 days buenfeld et al 1998 also described this result the main reason for this observation is that during the initial stage of ece treatment the produced amount of hydroxide ions around the cathode steel sharply increased with increasing desalting time the migration amount of hydroxide ions to the anode gradually increased resulting in a gradual slowing of the degree of the growth of hydroxide ion concentration around the steel bar at the 30th day fig 4 reveals that the content of chloride ion and hydroxide ions in the front of the steel bar point 3 in fig 1 are smaller than those in the middle point 4 in fig 1 or behind the steel bar point 6 in fig 1 the reason for this is that the ion transport phenomena in the rear of the rebar are mainly diffusion dominated rather than the result of an electric field force liu et al 2012 and liu et al 2014 have also described these interesting phenomena based on this the point in front of the steel bar was selected as the feature point of this study fig 5 a shows that ra grows with time and thus to express the quantitative relationship between them we get the fitting formula model 16 p t 0 002 t 2 0 47 t 4 35 where t denotes time d as is shown in fig 5b da grows with time while we use the following equation model to express the quantitative relationship between them 17 t t 0 004 t 2 0 48 t 40 18 where t is time d 4 2 effect of current density the effect of the appropriate current density on ece treatment efficiency is of significant importance if the current density is too small the efficiency of ece treatment is reduced consequently prolonging the time of ece treatment current density above 3 a m 2 will not be conducive to the overall performance of the concrete structure liu et al 2012 to investigate the effect of current density on the efficiency of ece treatment we designed case 11 to case 15 details are listed in table 1 fig 6 and fig 7 a show that with increasing current density the electric field intensity also increases the chloride ion migration rate increases and thus the removal of chloride ions within the cross section of specimen increased similar results have been observed by liu et al 2012 and liu et al 2014 fig 7b shows that the concentration of chloride ions in the front of the steel bar decreases during the initial stage of desalting and then as the externally applied current density decreases the electric field weakens and thus the diffusion of chlorine ions will become more pronounced consequently slightly increasing the chloride ion concentration in the front of bar after the 30th day of desalting the concentration of chloride ions in the front of the bar reached a specific level and then discharges to the outside under the action of the electric field thus slightly reducing the chloride ion concentration fig 8 a reveals that with the increase of current density the decrease degree of hydroxide ion content in the specimen is not clear this is because as the current density increases the moving rate of hydroxide ions in the specimen increases toward the anode while the production rate of hydroxide ions in the steel cathode enlarges fig 8b however in general the rate of hydroxide ions migrating to the anode was greater compared to that of the hydroxide ions production at the cathode therefore the concentration of total hydroxide ions decreased with time regardless of current density the data furthermore reveals that with increasing current density the degree of rate of hydroxide ions migration to the anode is higher than that of the hydroxide ion production at the cathode fig 9 a reveals that ra and the current density approximates into a linear relationship and we fit the formula model 18 p i 3 632 i 13 794 where i means the externally applied current density a m 2 fig 9b reveals that da grows with externally applied current density while to express the quantitative relationship between them we use the fitting formula model 19 t i 2 70 i 2 29 06 i 7 45 where i means the externally applied current density a m 2 4 3 effect of the ratio of cover thickness and side length to investigate the effect of the ratio of cover thickness and side length on the efficiency of ece treatment we designed case 21 to case 25 details are listed in table 1 fig 10 and fig 11 a reveal that with increasing ratio of cover thickness and side length the chloride ion migration region gradually increases and thus the amount of chloride ion slightly increases over the same time fig 11b reveals that during the initial stage of desalting the concentration of chloride ions at the front of the steel bar first decreases and then as the ratio of cover thickness and side length becomes smaller the diffusion of chlorine ions will become more significant so as to the chloride ion concentration in the front of bar increased slightly after the 30th day of desalting the concentration of chloride ions at the front of the bar reached a certain level and then discharged to the outside under the action of the electric field thus slightly reducing the chloride ion concentration in summary with the increase of the ratio of cover thickness and side length the degree of decline of chloride concentration in front of steel bar becomes gradual figs 10 and 12a reveal that in the initial stage of ece treatment the amount of hydroxide ions in the cross section of specimen sharply decreased after the 20th day the concentration of hydroxide ions in the cathode reinforcement increase with the increase of the ratio of cover thickness and side length and the transport number of ions decrease due to a decrease of the chloride ion content across the specimen thus the amount of hydroxide ions in the specimen caused slight growth in brief with the increase of the ratio of cover thickness and side length the degree of decline of hydroxide concentration in the specimen is gradually not obvious fig 12b furthermore reveals that during the initial stage of desalting the produced amount of hydroxyl ions in the front of the bar first sharply increased and then continued to increase slightly this is cause by the increase of the ratio of cover thickness and side length and a subsequent decrease of the electric field intensity thus the chloride ion migration rate decreases and the amount of chloride ions in the front of the bar increased fig 13 a reveals that ra and the ratio of cover thickness and side length approximates the slope of a gradual degradation of the positive linear relationship to express the quantitative relationship between them we utilize the fitting formula model 20 p c 14 09 c 2 19 91 c 18 56 where c denotes the ratio of cover thickness and side length fig 13b reveals that da decreases as the ratio of cover thickness and side length initially increases and then da increases with the ratio of cover thickness and side length when the ratio of cover thickness and side length exceeds 0 48 to express the quantitative relationship between them we use the following fitting formula model 21 t c 130 54 c 2 124 66 c 84 86 where c means the ratio of cover thickness and side length 4 4 effect of the initial concentration of chloride ions in order to investigate the effect of the initial concentration of chloride ions on the efficiency of ece treatment we designed case 31 to case 35 details are listed in table 1 fig 14 and fig 15 reveal that with the increase of the initial chloride ion concentration the amount of chlorine ions removed from the front of the steel slightly increased this tendency is consistent with the experimental findings of arya et al 1996 and has been theoretically investigated by liu et al 2012 however it is interesting to note that with increasing initial chlorine concentration the amount of chlorine ions removed in the specimen slightly decreased and then slightly increased this is caused by the level of inequity of the amount of chloride ion migrating to the anode and the amount of increase of the initial chloride ion concentration fig 16 a reveals that during the initial stage of desalting hydroxide ions rapidly migrate to the anode due to the electric field force then the concentration of hydroxide ions in the specimen first decreases with the increase of the initial concentration of chloride ions while the amount of hydroxide ions in the steel cathode gradually increased fig 16b the produced amount of hydroxyl ions gradually increased compared to the outward migration of hydroxide ions resulting in the amount of hydroxide ion in specimen slowly decreasing or even slightly increasing in the later period of ece treatment fig 17 a reveals that ra first increased with the initial concentration of chloride ions but decreased after the initial chloride ion concentration was about 0 35 m o l l to express the quantitative relationship between them we use the following fitting formula model 22 p i c 5 86 i c 2 3

sectional area of reinforcement to the cross sectional area of specimen to investigate the effect of the initial concentration of chloride ions on the efficiency of ece treatment we designed case 41 to case 44 details are listed in table 1 fig 18 and fig 19 reveal that with the ratio of cross sectional area of reinforcement to the cross sectional area of specimen increases the density magnitude between anode and multiple cathodes is much larger than that in the region from the anode to the single cathode and thus the amount of chlorine ions removed from the anode to multiple cathodes is much larger compared to the region from the anode to single cathode liu et al 2014 observed similar results fig 20 reveals that the amount of hydroxide ions at the front of the reinforcing steel increases with the increase of cross sectional area of reinforcement to the cross sectional area of specimen we also found that in the early stage of desalting the amount of hydroxide ions in the specimen initially decreased and then increased with the increase of the ratio of cross sectional area of reinforcement to the cross sectional area of specimen during middle and late stages of desalting and as the ratio of cross sectional area of reinforcement to the cross sectional area of specimen increased the produced amount of hydroxide ions gradually enlarged compared to the amount of outward discharge thus causing an increase in the amount of hydroxide ions in the specimen fig 21 a reveals that ra increased with the ratio of cross sectional area of reinforcement to the cross sectional area of specimen to express the quantitative relationship between them we use the following fitting formula model 24 p s c 0 02 s c 2 1 93 s c 10 43 where s c denotes the ratio of cross sectional area

desalination was analyzed above however it is often desirable to obtain the relationship model between total desalination efficiency and these factors it remains a significant challenge to obtain the

side length initial concentration of chloride ion ratio of cross sectional area of reinforcement to the cross sectional area of specimen the efficiency of ece of one side anode was analyzed in addition the quantitative relationship model between total electrochemical desalination efficiency and these factors was presented the simulation results have led to the following conclusions 1 during the initial stage of ece treatment the amount of hydroxide ions in the cross section of the specimen sharply decreased to a minimum value followed by a gradual increase of the amount of hydroxide ions in the cross section of specimen ra and da both grow with time 2 during the initial stage of desalting the concentration of chloride ions in the front of the steel bar initially decreased and then as the externally applied current density decreases the chloride ion concentration at the front of the bar slightly increased after the 30th day of desalting the chloride ion concentration at the front of the steel bar was slightly reduced again ra and da both grow with externally applied current density 3 in summary with the increase of the ratio of cover thickness and side length the degree of decline of the chloride concentration at the front of the steel bar is gradual ra and the ratio of cover thickness and side length approximate the slope of gradual degradation of the positive linear relationship da first decreases with increasing ratio of cover thickness and side length and then increases 4 with increasing initial chlorine concentration the amount of chlorine ions removed in the specimen slightly decreased followed by a slight increase during the initial stage of desalting the concentration of hydroxide ions in the specimen decreases at first and then with the increase of the

22867,electrochemical chloride extraction ece is one of the key ways to enhance the durability of concrete structure which suffered or are suffering from chloride attack to deeply understand the influence of various factors on chlorine removal efficiency this paper presents a numerical study to characterize transport and distribution of each ion during ece a plain concrete specimen was used as an example to investigate the influence of various factors on the efficiency of ece of one side anode these factors were time current density ratio of cover thickness and side length initial chloride ion concentration and ratio of cross sectional area of reinforcement to cross sectional area of specimen in addition the quantitative relationship model between these factors and total electrochemical desalination efficiency are also proposed good agreement between the present the quantitative relationship model of total desalination efficiency and the fem solution illustrates reliability and accuracy of the proposed relationship model keywords desalination chloride electrochemical chloride extraction ece finite element method 1 introduction corrosion of steel in concrete is recognized as the major source leading to deterioration of reinforced concrete rc structures yeih et al 2006 sergi et al 1992 shi et al 2012 in general a passive film surrounds the steel in concrete and keeps it in a stable state as soon as sufficient chlorine ions in case of sufficient oxygen will induce steel pitting corrosion when this starts it will affect structural safety stability and design service life therefore attention is focused on repairing and retrofitting of reinforced concrete structures that have been contaminated by chloride so far the remediation technology for chloride corroded concrete is mainly divided into traditional physical repair techniques such as the patch repair method and non traditional electrochemical repair technologies such as cathodic protection cp and electrochemical chloride extraction ece siegwart et al 2005 traditional physical repair technology cannot completely remove the chloride ions in the concrete and easily form a novel potential difference in the new patch thus accelerating corrosion of the built in steel weyers et al 1993 currently non traditional electrochemical repair technologies are widely used and cp utilizes an external electric current to change the potential of steel bars thus effectively inhibiting the corrosion of steel however the technology needs to be energized during the entire service life of the structure which comes at a higher cost liu et al 2009 ece has a higher current density than cp creating an electric field between rebar and external anode moving negative ions such as chloride ions toward the anodic electrolyte during a comparatively short period of time typically 4 8 weeks a significant reduction in chloride ions in concrete structures can be achieved at low cost fajardo et al 2006 laboratory tests have been conducted to investigate effectiveness and efficiency of ece e g swamy and mchugh 2006 examined effectiveness and structural implications of ece applied to reinforced concrete beams containing chlorides and reactive aggregates orellan et al 2004 verified the effectiveness of ece and possible formation of new phases in both concrete and steel interfaces garcés et al 2006 reported that the efficiency of ece depends on the arrangement of reinforcing bars saraswathy et al 2018 examined the effect of ece of chloride contaminated concrete consisting of embedded rebar in corroded condition was assessed by measuring the corrosion rate and rebar potential after the ece treatment at three different current density and by using three types of anodes experiments are an effective means to solve ece but experiments are time consuming cost intensive and most important individual effects of various factors are difficult to determine due to interactions between different factors liu et al 2014 with the development of computer technology an increasing number of researchers have begun to use numerical simulation models to investigate the transport behavior of multi species in concrete these models are based on the nernst planck equation e g wang et al 2001 combined the porous media theory and has proposed a two dimensional computer model to simulate chloride removal from concrete liu et al 2014 has presented a three phase numerical model to investigate the performance and efficiency of ece treatment feng et al 2016 proposed a 2 dimensional 2 phase computer model with a surface charge and revealed some important features of surface charge on the concentration distribution of individual ionic species liu et al 2018 treated concrete as a three phase composite including mortar aggregates and interfacial transition zone itz and through numerical analysis some important features about the effect of aggregate shape has been revealed mao et al 2019 numerically evaluated the efficiency of the impregnation of lithium ions and the removal of chloride ions through ece treatment as a technique the effectiveness efficiency and economy of ece should be of concern and is associated with a variety of factors however the effect of various factors on the efficiency of ece remains unclear using existing experiments or numerical simulations the efficiency of ece has not been studied extensively and the quantitative relationship between ece desalting efficiency and influencing factors remains unknown in this study a plain concrete specimen was used as an example the distribution of each ion in the process of ece was numerically solved using a finite element method built in commercial finite element software the influence of time current density ratio of cover thickness and side length initial concentration of chloride ion ratio of cross sectional area of reinforcement to the cross sectional area of specimen on the efficiency of ece of one side anode were investigated furthermore the quantitative relationship model between total electrochemical desalination efficiency and these factors is presented 2 theoretical foundation for ece since the electrochemical reaction 1 leads to the reduction of o h in the electrolyte the ph value of the solution decreases consequently ece treatment sets the surface of the concrete specimen with electrolyte of c a o h 2 orellan et al 2004 or l i o h mo et al 2003 moreover the metal mesh is used as anode in the electrolyte and the reinforced steel is used as cathode in the concrete the applied electric field is applied between anode and cathode and the original chloride ions move to the external anode electrolyte while positive ions move towards the built in reinforcement and this reinforcement produces negative ion o h via cathodic reaction which is beneficial for the re passivation of steel as shown in fig 1 polder 1996 bertolini et al 1996 ihekwaba et al 1996 elsener and angst 2007 during ece treatment the following electrochemical reactions occur at the anode liu et al 2014 wang et al 2001 1 4 o h 2 h 2 o o 2 4 e 2 2 h 2 o 4 h o 2 4 e 3 h c l h c l and at the cathode liu et al 2014 wang et al 2001 4 2 h 2 o o 2 4 e 4 o h 5 2 h 2 o 2 e 2 o h h 2 the transport of ionic species can be expressed by equations of mass conservation ionic flow current conservation and electroneutrality condition as follows allen and larry 1980 6 c i t j i 7 j i d i c i z i u i f c i 8 i f i 1 n z i j i 9 i 1 n z i c i 0 where c i is the concentration of ionic species t is the time j i is the flux z i is the charge number of ionic species f 9 648 10 4 c m o l is the faraday constant u i is ionic mobility is the electrostatic potential i is the current density subscript i represents the i t h species and n is the total number of species contained in the mortar in an ideal electrolyte ionic mobility u i takes the form of allen and larry 1980 10 u i d i r t where d i is

number of ionic species u i is the ionic mobility c i is the concentration of ionic species subscript i j represents the i j t h species and n is the total number of the species contained in the mortar substituting eq 10 into 7 and eq 7 into 6 yields the nernst planck equation as follows 12 c i t d i c i z i u i f c i 0 substituting eqs 8 and 9 into 7 yields the following equation 13 f r t i f i 1 n z i d i c i i 1 n z i 2 d i c i in summary when boundary conditions and initial conditions are known the problem of the transport of each ion in the saturated medium can be solved via equations 9 12 and 13 which has been widely used and verified liu et al 2012 2014 feng et al 2016 hassanein et al 2013 3 numerical simulation in order to simulate the ece process a plain concrete specimen 100 mm 100 mm with built in reinforcement with a 5 mm radius was desalted for eight weeks prior to investigation a total of 27 groups case01 case44 of data were selected for comparison detailed parameters see table 1 the base case case13 configuration represents the control and one bar of 5 mm radius was centrally spaced in the specimen as depicted in fig 1 initially the specimen was saturated with a solution of five ionic species potassium sodium chloride hydroxyl and calcium liu et al 2012 2014 2015 li and page 2000 externally a constant direct current dc was applied between reinforcing steel bars and an anode placed on the left side of the specimen while the remaining three sides were no flux the basic settings of the five individual ionic species used in the simulation are listed in table 2 wang et al 2001 the finite element software was used to simulate the transport of each ion in saturated media under ece treatment to increase data convergence and accuracy we used extremely finer free meshing in finite element meshing making the following assumptions 1 concrete is considered homogeneous 2 it doesn t consider ion convection 3 it doesn t consider the combination of the ion and the reaction between ions 4 the pore solution in concrete was saturated dilute solution 5 the flux of hydroxyl ions at the cathode equals the externally applied current density 4 simulation results and discussions the purpose of ece treatment was to discharge the chloride ions in concrete as much as possible astm stand 2005 while reducing reinforcement around c l o h hausmann 1967 mehta and monteiro 1993 therefore in this paper two indicators were selected to reflect the efficiency of ece treatment the removal rate of overall chloride ion across the whole geometry domain after ece treatment ra was defined as 14 p c 0 c t c 0 where c 0 denotes the chloride concentration across the whole geometry domain before ece treatment m o l m and c t denotes the chloride concentration across the whole geometry domain after ece treatment m o l m notice that c 0 and c t is calculated via integrating the chloride ion concentration m o l m 3 across the whole geometry domain m 2 decrease rate of c l o h in front of the bar da 15 t t 0 t t t 0 where t 0 denotes decreased rate of c l o h in front of the bar before ece treatment t t denotes decreased rate of c l o h in front of the bar after ece treatment numerous factors influence the efficiency of ece treatment according to published literature ihekwaba et al 1996 arya et al 1996 liu et al 2012 b and ann 2016 pérez et al 2010 thus this study investigated the influence of these key factors time current density ratio of cover thickness and side length initial concentration of chloride ion and ratio of cross sectional area of reinforcement to the cross sectional area of specimen on the efficiency of ece of one side anode utilizing the finite element method built in commercial finite element software furthermore the quantitative relationship between total electrochemical desalination efficiency and these factors was presented 4 1 effect of time in a very short period of time typically 4 8 weeks ece treatment can achieve a significant reduction of chloride ions in concrete structures at low cost fajardo et al 2006 to investigate the effect of time on the efficiency of ece treatment we designed case 01 to case 08 details are listed in table 1 as is shown in fig 2 and fig 3 a the chloride ion content in the cross section of the specimen decreases with increasing time additionally fig 4 a reveals that the chloride ion content in the steel bars sharply decreased in the early stage of ece treatment and the degree of decrease of chloride ion content surrounding the rebar gradually decreased in the middle and late period of ece treatment these results are consistent with the work of liu et al 2012 and arya et al 1996 the main reason for this phenomenon is that the transport number of ions is higher in the initial stage of ece treatment which is caused by the higher chloride ion concentration in the initial stage of ece treatment consequently chloride ion content around the steel declined sharply in the initial stage of ece treatment with the passage of time the concentration of hydroxide ions in the cathode reinforcement increased while the transport number of ions decreased due to a decrease in chloride ion content across the specimen fig 3b reveals a sharp decrease to a minimum value of the amount of hydroxide ions in the cross section of specimen in the initial stage of ece treatment followed by a gradual increase of the amount of hydroxide ions in the cross section of specimen the main reason for this phenomenon is that in the initial stage of ece treatment the amount of hydroxide ions in the cross section of the specimen rapidly migrated to the anode and thus the amount of hydroxide ions in the cross section of specimen decreased sharply in the later period of ece treatment the amount of hydroxide ions in the cathode reinforcement increased and the transport number of hydroxide ions decreased due to the observed decrease of hydroxide ion content across the specimen thus during the late period of ece treatment the amount of hydroxide ions in the cross section of specimen slightly increases fig 4b also reveals that in the initial stage of ece treatment the content of hydroxide ions around the reinforcing steel sharply increases with passing time the degree of hydroxide ion concentration around the steel bar growth gradually slowed down after 30 days buenfeld et al 1998 also described this result the main reason for this observation is that during the initial stage of ece treatment the produced amount of hydroxide ions around the cathode steel sharply increased with increasing desalting time the migration amount of hydroxide ions to the anode gradually increased resulting in a gradual slowing of the degree of the growth of hydroxide ion concentration around the steel bar at the 30th day fig 4 reveals that the content of chloride ion and hydroxide ions in the front of the steel bar point 3 in fig 1 are smaller than those in the middle point 4 in fig 1 or behind the steel bar point 6 in fig 1 the reason for this is that the ion transport phenomena in the rear of the rebar are mainly diffusion dominated rather than the result of an electric field force liu et al 2012 and liu et al 2014 have also described these interesting phenomena based on this the point in front of the steel bar was selected as the feature point of this study fig 5 a shows that ra grows with time and thus to express the quantitative relationship between them we get the fitting formula model 16 p t 0 002 t 2 0 47 t 4 35 where t denotes time d as is shown in fig 5b da grows with time while we use the following equation model to express the quantitative relationship between them 17 t t 0 004 t 2 0 48 t 40 18 where t is time d 4 2 effect of current density the effect of the appropriate current density on ece treatment efficiency is of significant importance if the current density is too small the efficiency of ece treatment is reduced consequently prolonging the time of ece treatment current density above 3 a m 2 will not be conducive to the overall performance of the concrete structure liu et al 2012 to investigate the effect of current density on the efficiency of ece treatment we designed case 11 to case 15 details are listed in table 1 fig 6 and fig 7 a show that with increasing current density the electric field intensity also increases the chloride ion migration rate increases and thus the removal of chloride ions within the cross section of specimen increased similar results have been observed by liu et al 2012 and liu et al 2014 fig 7b shows that the concentration of chloride ions in the front of the steel bar decreases during the initial stage of desalting and then as the externally applied current density decreases the electric field weakens and thus the diffusion of chlorine ions will become more pronounced consequently slightly increasing the chloride ion concentration in the front of bar after the 30th day of desalting the concentration of chloride ions in the front of the bar reached a specific level and then discharges to the outside under the action of the electric field thus slightly reducing the chloride ion concentration fig 8 a reveals that with the increase of current density the decrease degree of hydroxide ion content in the specimen is not clear this is because as the current density increases the moving rate of hydroxide ions in the specimen increases toward the anode while the production rate of hydroxide ions in the steel cathode enlarges fig 8b however in general the rate of hydroxide ions migrating to the anode was greater compared to that of the hydroxide ions production at the cathode therefore the concentration of total hydroxide ions decreased with time regardless of current density the data furthermore reveals that with increasing current density the degree of rate of hydroxide ions migration to the anode is higher than that of the hydroxide ion production at the cathode fig 9 a reveals that ra and the current density approximates into a linear relationship and we fit the formula model 18 p i 3 632 i 13 794 where i means the externally applied current density a m 2 fig 9b reveals that da grows with externally applied current density while to express the quantitative relationship between them we use the fitting formula model 19 t i 2 70 i 2 29 06 i 7 45 where i means the externally applied current density a m 2 4 3 effect of the ratio of cover thickness and side length to investigate the effect of the ratio of cover thickness and side length on the efficiency of ece treatment we designed case 21 to case 25 details are listed in table 1 fig 10 and fig 11 a reveal that with increasing ratio of cover thickness and side length the chloride ion migration region gradually increases and thus the amount of chloride ion slightly increases over the same time fig 11b reveals that during the initial stage of desalting the concentration of chloride ions at the front of the steel bar first decreases and then as the ratio of cover thickness and side length becomes smaller the diffusion of chlorine ions will become more significant so as to the chloride ion concentration in the front of bar increased slightly after the 30th day of desalting the concentration of chloride ions at the front of the bar reached a certain level and then discharged to the outside under the action of the electric field thus slightly reducing the chloride ion concentration in summary with the increase of the ratio of cover thickness and side length the degree of decline of chloride concentration in front of steel bar becomes gradual figs 10 and 12a reveal that in the initial stage of ece treatment the amount of hydroxide ions in the cross section of specimen sharply decreased after the 20th day the concentration of hydroxide ions in the cathode reinforcement increase with the increase of the ratio of cover thickness and side length and the transport number of ions decrease due to a decrease of the chloride ion content across the specimen thus the amount of hydroxide ions in the specimen caused slight growth in brief with the increase of the ratio of cover thickness and side length the degree of decline of hydroxide concentration in the specimen is gradually not obvious fig 12b furthermore reveals that during the initial stage of desalting the produced amount of hydroxyl ions in the front of the bar first sharply increased and then continued to increase slightly this is cause by the increase of the ratio of cover thickness and side length and a subsequent decrease of the electric field intensity thus the chloride ion migration rate decreases and the amount of chloride ions in the front of the bar increased fig 13 a reveals that ra and the ratio of cover thickness and side length approximates the slope of a gradual degradation of the positive linear relationship to express the quantitative relationship between them we utilize the fitting formula model 20 p c 14 09 c 2 19 91 c 18 56 where c denotes the ratio of cover thickness and side length fig 13b reveals that da decreases as the ratio of cover thickness and side length initially increases and then da increases with the ratio of cover thickness and side length when the ratio of cover thickness and side length exceeds 0 48 to express the quantitative relationship between them we use the following fitting formula model 21 t c 130 54 c 2 124 66 c 84 86 where c means the ratio of cover thickness and side length 4 4 effect of the initial concentration of chloride ions in order to investigate the effect of the initial concentration of chloride ions on the efficiency of ece treatment we designed case 31 to case 35 details are listed in table 1 fig 14 and fig 15 reveal that with the increase of the initial chloride ion concentration the amount of chlorine ions removed from the front of the steel slightly increased this tendency is consistent with the experimental findings of arya et al 1996 and has been theoretically investigated by liu et al 2012 however it is interesting to note that with increasing initial chlorine concentration the amount of chlorine ions removed in the specimen slightly decreased and then slightly increased this is caused by the level of inequity of the amount of chloride ion migrating to the anode and the amount of increase of the initial chloride ion concentration fig 16 a reveals that during the initial stage of desalting hydroxide ions rapidly migrate to the anode due to the electric field force then the concentration of hydroxide ions in the specimen first decreases with the increase of the initial concentration of chloride ions while the amount of hydroxide ions in the steel cathode gradually increased fig 16b the produced amount of hydroxyl ions gradually increased compared to the outward migration of hydroxide ions resulting in the amount of hydroxide ion in specimen slowly decreasing or even slightly increasing in the later period of ece treatment fig 17 a reveals that ra first increased with the initial concentration of chloride ions but decreased after the initial chloride ion concentration was about 0 35 m o l l to express the quantitative relationship between them we use the following fitting formula model 22 p i c 5 86 i c 2 3 65 i c 24 13 where i c means the initial concentration of chloride ions m o l l fig 17b reveals that da decrease with the initial chloride ion concentration and to express the quantitative relationship between them we use the following fitting formula model 23 t i c 0 64 i c 2 1 42 i c 55 72 where i c is the initial concentration of chloride ions m o l l 4 5 effect of the ratio of cross sectional area of reinforcement to the cross sectional area of specimen to investigate the effect of the initial concentration of chloride ions on the efficiency of ece treatment we designed case 41 to case 44 details are listed in table 1 fig 18 and fig 19 reveal that with the ratio of cross sectional area of reinforcement to the cross sectional area of specimen increases the density magnitude between anode and multiple cathodes is much larger than that in the region from the anode to the single cathode and thus the amount of chlorine ions removed from the anode to multiple cathodes is much larger compared to the region from the anode to single cathode liu et al 2014 observed similar results fig 20 reveals that the amount of hydroxide ions at the front of the reinforcing steel increases with the increase of cross sectional area of reinforcement to the cross sectional area of specimen we also found that in the early stage of desalting the amount of hydroxide ions in the specimen initially decreased and then increased with the increase of the ratio of cross sectional area of reinforcement to the cross sectional area of specimen during middle and late stages of desalting and as the ratio of cross sectional area of reinforcement to the cross sectional area of specimen increased the produced amount of hydroxide ions gradually enlarged compared to the amount of outward discharge thus causing an increase in the amount of hydroxide ions in the specimen fig 21 a reveals that ra increased with the ratio of cross sectional area of reinforcement to the cross sectional area of specimen to express the quantitative relationship between them we use the following fitting formula model 24 p s c 0 02 s c 2 1 93 s c 10 43 where s c denotes the ratio of cross sectional area of reinforcement to the cross sectional area of specimen fig 21b reveals da increased with the ratio of cross sectional area of reinforcement to the cross sectional area of specimen to express the quantitative relationship between them we use the following fitting formula model 25 t s c 0 04 s c 2 2 53 s c 37 97 where s c denotes the ratio of cross sectional area of reinforcement to the cross sectional area of specimen 5 the quantitative relationship between total desalination efficiency and the investigated 5 1 factors the relationship between each factor and the efficiency of desalination was analyzed above however it is often desirable to obtain the relationship model between total desalination efficiency and these factors it remains a significant challenge to obtain the

addition the quantitative relationship model between total electrochemical desalination efficiency and these factors was presented the simulation results have led to the following conclusions 1 during the initial stage of ece treatment the amount of hydroxide ions in the cross section of the specimen sharply decreased to a minimum value followed by a gradual increase of the amount of hydroxide ions in the cross section of specimen ra and da both grow with time 2 during the initial stage of desalting the concentration of chloride ions in the front of the steel bar initially decreased and then as the externally applied current density decreases the chloride ion concentration at the front of the bar slightly increased after the 30th day of desalting the chloride ion concentration at the front of the steel bar was slightly reduced again ra and da both grow with externally applied current density 3 in summary with the increase of the ratio of cover thickness and side length the degree of

experiments is investigated a wide range of wedges with deadrise angles of 5 35 are dropped into water at the entry velocity of 3 13 m s and impact pressures are recorded with different sampling rates results are compared to analyze the effect of sampling rate on outcomes finally to mitigate the negative aspects some thresholds of sampling rate are determined for different wedges it was found that for wedges with deadrise angles of 25 and higher a sampling rate of 25 khz is adequate for this configuration this sampling rate however is not appropriate for deadrise angles lower than 20 where a higher rate is needed results indicate that the acceptable sampling rate for a wedge of 5 deadrise angle is 600 khz at water entry velocity of 3 13 m s keywords slamming impact pressure sampling rate wedge water entry experiment 1 introduction water entry experiments are considered to be one of the powerful means to evaluate slamming loads on different structures slamming loads are mostly known as impact type forces having high spike pressure in a very short time these characteristics result in a complexity that restricts the measuring system by which slamming loads or pressures are recorded the slamming pressures are usually measured by piezoelectric pressure transducers these sensors normally demonstrate a very high resonance frequency jointly with a very quick rise time reflection that allows them to have a great performance for recording impact pressures in each test firstly the impact pressure is consistently recorded by transducers as output signals forming analogue data secondly signals are amplified by a signal conditioner and then are driven to data acquisition system finally to obtain results data are converted to digital values using an a to d board each a to d board has a maximum sampling rate which represents the number of samples that could be acquired per second considering the impact type of pressures peak values occur in a very short period usually in the order of milliseconds or shorter consequently to fully record the exerted pressure especially the peak value sampling rate plays a very important role sampling rate lower than the required one causes missing data and records unreliable and inaccurate data during the acquisition process on the other hand extra sampling rate results in expensive bulky and time consuming process with lots of intrusive oscillations of data the adequate rate is not identical for all experiments and varies based on the features of each test as a result finding the appropriate sampling rate for each type of water entry experiment is both challenging and mandatory due to their various applications in engineering wedge shape models are widely used in water entry experiments okada and sumi 2000 recorded impact pressure and strain for wedges with low deadrise angles at a sampling rate of 10 khz truong et al 2010 reported impact pressure exerted on a wedge of 5 deadrise angle in two low constant impact velocities they collected data at 37 khz yettou et al 2006 studied pressure time history of wedges with deadrise angles of 15 20 25 30 and 35 at a sampling rate of 5 khz yang et al 2007 investigated pressure distribution on wedges of 5 and 0 deadrise angles with the sampling rate of 5 khz lewis et al 2010 selected 10 khz as the sampling rate to study the impact pressure on a wedge of 25 deadrise angle water entry of a rigid and flexible wedge of 10 deadrise angle was investigated by battley and allen 2012 in their research data was sampled at rates of 10 30 khz for different constant impact velocities numerical and experimental water entry of a flexible wedge was carried out by panciroli et al 2013 the sampling rate of their experiments was 4 khz tenzer et al 2015 studied the effect of sampling rate on peak pressure of a wedge of 10 deadrise angle they reported 96 khz as an adequate sampling rate and conducted some experiments on a wedge of 5 deadrise angle at the same rate barjasteh et al 2016 investigated water entry of asymmetric wedges with deadrise angles of 20 and 30 with the inclination angle of 5 10 and 15 they set the sampling rate at 25 khz for wedges dropped from different heights including 0 20 0 50 and 0 75 m some experiments were done on wedges by nikfarjam et al 2017 to investigate the effects of deadrise angle and drop height on impact pressure they selected the sampling rate of 25 khz for their studies water entry experiments are not limited to investigations on merely wedge shape models and other shapes might be included too experimental water entry of a cylinder was investigated by lin and shieh 1997 they reported data at 25 khz de backer et al 2009 conducted some experiments on a hemisphere and two conical shapes with 20 and 45 deadrise angles although they set the sampling rate at 30 khz they repeated some experiments at 100 khz to make sure that no higher peak pressure is lost colicchio et al 2009 analyzed water entry and water exit of a rigid circular cylinder drop height and sampling rate of their experiments were 0 48 m and 16 khz respectively van nuffel et al 2013 thoroughly studied the effects of different parameters on experimental water entry of a rigid cylinder and reported the sampling rate as one of the most important ones they repeated the experiments with different sampling rates including 16 25 100 200 300 and 400 khz and concluded that the 300 khz is the minimum adequate value for experiments with impact speeds up to 5 m s slamming pressure and hydro elastic vibrations on a flat plate were investigated by yan et al 2015 and yan et al 2016 data were recorded at 10 khz for the model which was dropped from different drop heights water entry of an oblique flat plate with a high horizontal velocity was also investigated by iafrati et al 2015 pressure deformation and exerted force due to water entry were reported at 200 khz ma et al 2016 numerically and experimentally studied entry of a rigid flat plate into pure and aerated water the sampling rate in this research was selected to be 50 khz reviewing the experimental investigations shows that different researchers employ a range of acquisition sampling rate see table 1 according to the authors knowledge van nuffel et al 2013 on cylindrical test and tenzer et al 2015 on a wedge of 10 deadrise angle were the only researchers who particularly studied effects of sampling rate for water entry experiments the authors specially the first author have been involved in several cases during last ten years barjasteh et al 2016 javaherian 2013 zeraatgar et al 2012 the existed facilities have the capability for recording up to 100 khz adjustable sampling rate eventually sample testing with existed facilities with different sampling rates had shown some discrepancies between records on that basis a new a to d system having 1000 khz sampling rate has been bought and added to existed test facilities and the water entry tests have been repeated the results were quite interesting the absence of a similar consideration inspired the authors to conduct a thorough study on sampling rate effects on water entry of wedges and to investigate the adequate frequency for different deadrise angles in this paper water entry of an assortment of wedges with deadrise angles of 5 7 10 15 20 25 30 and 35 is experimentally investigated at single water entry velocity of 3 13 m s pressure time history for wedges with both sampling rates of 25 khz and 1 mhz is recorded and compared to see whether the sampling rate affects the peak pressures additionally for a wedge of 5 deadrise angle more experiments are conducted for a range of sampling rates to study its effect on peak pressures and finally to find out an appropriate minimum sampling rate for this wedge 2 experiments 2 1 experimental setup fig 1 shows experimental water entry setup of amirkabir laboratory of hydrodynamics barjasteh et al 2016 the main frame is equipped with two accurate guide rails which let models to freely fall into a transparent tank having dimensions of 1 122 0 572 0 681 m the model presented in fig 2 is a wedge that consists of two sides each of which is made of a 0 205 0 530 m stainless steel plate with the thickness of 8 mm each side can be independently set from 0 to 40 of 1 increment and are connected to each other using two special radial sliding bearings the impacting body weighs 44 kgf as illustrated in fig 3 there are 20 available positions to mount pcb 102b04 pressure transducers the location of transducers is determined based on the requirements of each test in this study p1 p2 and p3 are target locations 2 2 data acquisition data recorded by transducers are amplified using a four channel pcb 482a16 signal conditioner a national instruments ni 9222 9223 is employed for acquiring digital data this acquisition board has four channels with the sampling rate up to 1 mhz for each channel the pressure transducers the signal conditioner and the acquisition board are the data recording system see fig 3 b actually using a ni 9222 9223 acquisition board allows authors to record the pressure with a wide range of sampling rates the obtained pressures are filtered by a moving average filter of five consecutive points filtered peak values are compared with raw data to make sure that the reported peak value is not lost after applying the filter 3 results several calibration tests have been conducted to ensure the repeatability reliability and accuracy of records barjasteh et al 2016 once the validity of records was verified main tests were started drop height is fixed at 0 50 m for all tests it should be noted that the pressure curves are synchronized using the peak pressure for comparison fig 4 shows pressure time histories for a wedge with β 35 and sampling rates of 25 khz and 1 mhz for each sampling rate the left plot represents the impact pressure recorded by p1 which is followed by p2 and p3 pressures subsequently results show that increasing of sampling rate does not affect the trend and the peak pressure nevertheless the higher frequency has caused some irrational oscillations due to intrusive electrical noises or mechanical vibrations therefore it can be concluded that the primary sampling rate sr 25 khz is quite adequate for water entry experiments on a wedge with 35 deadrise angle figs 5 and 6 indicate the corresponding results for wedges with deadrise angles of 30 and 25 respectively in both cases tracking data related to different transducers confirms that increasing of sampling rate does not result in any tangible differences qualitatively and quantitatively consequently 25 khz could be considered as a proper sampling rate for these wedges pressure time history for a wedge of 20 deadrise angle is shown in fig 7 results reveal that increasing of sampling rate affects the peak pressures recorded by the first and the second transducers p1 and p2 each of which experienced an increase of 12 percent meanwhile data recorded by the third transducer p3 remains unchanged this behavior can be justified considering the variation of jet speed on the wedge the jet speed at the initial stages of penetration is so high that makes a rapid variation of peak pressure exerted on p1 and p2 as it moves toward the chine the jet gradually loses its initial speed thus the peak pressure experienced by p3 might not be as quick as to be missed with the sampling rate of 25 khz it should be noted that for a higher impact speed corresponding to drop height of more than 0 50 m some deviation might be discernible for p3 too as a result the sampling rate of 25 khz would not be enough for the experiments on a wedge of β 20 and a higher sampling rate is required the effects of sampling rate on a wedge of 15 deadrise angle are very similar to what presented for a wedge of 20 qualitatively results for sampling rates of 25 khz and 1000 khz are depicted in fig 8 the increase of peak pressures of p1 and p2 are recorded to be 48 and 10 percent respectively pressure time history corresponding to p3 stays almost the same in both sampling rates as discussed earlier fig 9 presents sampling rate effect for a wedge with β 10 for this wedge transducers p1 and p2 record an increase of peak pressures the difference between the maximum peak values is reported to be 51 percent for p1 moreover an increase of 27 percent is recorded for p2 while no significant variation is observed at p3 since the current setup allows adjusting wedges of any arbitrary deadrise angles a wedge of β 7 is set for further study as depicted in fig 10 each transducer shows a large increase on the maximum peak as 101 66 and 27 percent for p1 p2 and p3 respectively the last tested wedge is a wedge of 5 deadrise angle fig 11 discloses the results which are highly dependent on the sampling rates both sensors p1 and p2 recorded more than 100 percent increase in their peak values additionally p3 recorded a peak pressure of 75 percent increase in respect to the sampling rate of 25 khz therefore the sampling rate of 25 khz is not adequate for this wedge 4 discussions 4 1 sampling rate effect reviewing data collected by all experiments indicates that the sampling rate has significant effect on the peak pressures recorded for wedges having water entry test record by different sampling rate the fluctuation of the peak pressures of transducers varies for different wedges fig 12 illustrates the increase of peak pressure of each transducer p1 p2 and p3 for deadrise angles of 35 30 and 25 the sampling rate of 25 khz is enough and increase of the sampling rate does not improve the quality of the measurement however for wedges including 20 15 10 7 and 5 the sampling rate of 25 khz is not adequate it is also worthwhile to compare current results with other studies using pressure coefficient c p max which is defined as follows 1 c p max p max 0 5 ρ w v o 2 where v 0 is the impact velocity defined by v 0 2 g h and h 0 is the falling height set to h 0 0 50 m for this study fig 13 presents such a comparison in which current experiments are compared with other experimental and analytical investigations results of sr 25 khz have a very good agreement with javaherian 2013 and yettou et al 2006 experiments it can be observed that for deadrise angles of 15 and lower wagner method wagner 1932 overestimates the maximum cp where he neglects the air drag and cushioning effect as well as water compressibility since the sampling rate dramatically affected the impact pressures measurement on a wedge of 5 deadrise angle additional investigations were carried out for this wedge for a range of sampling rates including sr 100 200 400 600 and 800 khz figs 14 16 demonstrate the results of experiments results reveal that the adequate sampling rate for p1 is 400 khz while for p2 and p3 the pressure diagrams converge at 600 khz in addition it can be observed that for higher sampling rates the time duration of rising and falling of peak pressure say time duration occurs in a significant shorter duration rather than the frequency of 25 khz fig 17 depicts that the sampling rate not only affects the quantity but also alters the location of peak pressure for frequencies of 100 khz and lower p3 records the highest peak pressure whereas for higher rates the location of the highest peak pressure moves back to the p2 position 4 2 repeatability as mentioned in sec 2 these tests have been conducted on the test facilities being established in amirkabir laboratory of hydrodynamics the uncertainty analysis for experimental set up has already been performed for the wedge symmetry repeatability 3d effect and depth effect by barjasteh et al 2016 as far as current tests are considered due to very small deadrise angles further repetition of tests is required to capture any uncertainties of pressure records accompanied with the test results in this work each test is conducted at least three times to check the repeatability of the recorded data table 2 reports the repeatability test results for wedges of 5 and 10 deadrise angles for sr 25 and 1000 khz for 5 wedge the closer test to the mean value was earlier selected for presenting fig 11 it should be noted that results of a wedge of 5 deadrise angle have less repeatability in comparison with other wedges the main reason is attributed to the air cushion which inevitably and slightly changes the water surface level at the initial stage of penetration nonetheless the test results are fairly close to a reasonable repeatability a comparison between peak pressure variation due to repeatability and sampling rate is presented in table 3 for deadrise angle of 5 as an example generally one may define relative change for each sampling rate as follows 2 e s r p p e a k p p e a k a t s r 1000 k h z p p e a k a t s r 1000 k h z 100 3 e r e p m a x p p e a k p p e a k a v e r a g e p p e a k a v e r a g e 100 where e s r denotes the relative change of peak pressure compared to sr 1000 khz and e r e p denotes the maximum relative change of peak pressures compared to average peak pressure in repeatability test results results show that the relative change due to sampling rate e s r may rise as much as 54 while the maximum relative change due to repeatability e r e p is 7 additionally the relative change of repeatability appears randomly while the relative change due to sampling rates has a trend say bias on that basis it is concluded that the significant pressure variation in various sampling rates does not have any correlation with repeatability instead they are being influenced by the sampling rate effect 4 3 effects of air entrapment in figs 9 11 some oscillations were discernible after the peak value for wedges of 10 7 and 5 deadrise angles the frequencies of oscillation are presented in table 4 van nuffel et al 2014 also reported some oscillations of the impact pressure at the bottom of a cylinder he supposed that the oscillations might be originated from different physical phenomena including acoustic wave pressure vibrations and air cushion as far as the acoustic wave is concerned tank depth in all experiments is set to be 0 35 m given the speed of sound in water vw 1484 m s the acoustic reciprocating period can be calculated as follows 4 δ t 2 d v w 0 7 1484 0 471 m s this period is equivalent to the frequency of 2120 hz which is far lower than the frequency of oscillations thus there is not any rational connection between pressure oscillations and acoustic wave pressure another phenomenon that is likely to cause pressure oscillations is the structural vibration to investigate its effect on recorded pressure the acceleration of wedge with deadrise angle of 5 is also recorded fig 18 shows the time track of the acceleration at the location of pressure sensors the frequencies of the highest energy are 573 643 and 843 hz respectively which are determined by fft analysis the structural natural frequency of the body in water was recorded using hammering test and found to be 509 hz barjasteh et al 2016 the acceleration oscillation frequencies are different from the natural frequency of wedge structure additionally pressure oscillation frequencies given in table 4 are very high and far from the first natural frequency it should be noted that the structure does not vibrate with the higher modes while the first mode is not excited consequently it may be concluded that the pressure oscillations are irrelevant to the vibrations of the structure note that the effect of elasticity on the recorded pressure depends on the arrangement and strength of the structure of the wedge under consideration the authors have intentionally used a thick steel plate to control the hydroelastic effect on the pressure record other researchers must consider the interactions between pressure and structural deformation individually according to the structure of their test set up lin and shieh 1997 assumed that the high frequency oscillations of pressure during cylinder water entry are likely due to air cushion van nuffel et al 2014 employed a high speed camera and verified this possibility detailed examination of the role of aeration in flat plate water entry by mai 2017 showed that compression and expansion of the trapped air bubbles caused the pressure oscillations to consider this phenomenon a high speed camera is employed to visualize the entry of a wedge of 5 deadrise angles the bottom view of the entrapped air is captured at 1000 fps and illustrated in fig 19 the white spots show the entrapped air moving toward the chines as the wedge gradually penetrates into the water the sensor p1 is located at a region closer to the apex say closer to initial air bubbles and records higher oscillations in comparison with p2 and p3 thus the pressure oscillations may occur due to air bubble entrapment as far as pressure oscillations of high deadrise angle wedges say 25 30 and 35 are concerned they are due to mains frequency 5 conclusions in this paper a detailed survey has been performed in order to study the sampling rate effect on pressure recorded by water entry experiments an assortment of wedges with various deadrise angles ranging from 5 to 35 was dropped into water and pressure were recorded with different sampling rates experiments reveal that using inappropriate sampling rate may yield to erroneous results and unreliable outcomes particularly the magnitude of peak pressures in addition it may misreport the location of maximum peak pressure on wedges to avoid misevaluation some thresholds of sampling rate were determined for different wedges it was found that for wedges with deadrise angles of 25 and higher a sampling rate of 25 khz is adequate this sampling rate however is not appropriate for deadrise angles lower than 20 where a higher rate is needed results indicate that the acceptable sampling rate for a wedge of 5 deadrise angle is 600 khz it should be noted that these thresholds could be applied to all water entry experiments on wedges having drop heights up to 0 50 m say the impact velocity of 3 13 m s for higher impact velocities the validity of the above mentioned thresholds has to be verified by conducting a similar study the general conclusion of this study is that a set of sampling rate independency test is required for each water entry test configuration

angles of 35 30 and 25 the sampling rate of 25 khz is enough and increase of the sampling rate does not improve the quality of the measurement however for wedges including 20 15 10 7 and 5 the sampling rate of 25 khz is not adequate it is also worthwhile to compare current results with other studies using pressure coefficient c p max which is defined as follows 1 c p max p max 0 5 ρ w v o 2 where v 0 is the impact velocity defined by v 0 2 g h and h 0 is the falling height set to h 0 0 50 m for this study fig 13 presents such a comparison in which current experiments are compared with other experimental and analytical investigations results of sr 25 khz have a very good agreement with javaherian 2013 and yettou et al 2006 experiments it can be observed that for deadrise angles of 15 and lower wagner method wagner 1932 overestimates the maximum cp where he neglects the air drag and cushioning effect as well as water compressibility since the sampling rate dramatically affected the impact pressures measurement on a wedge of 5 deadrise angle additional investigations were carried out for this wedge for a range of sampling rates including sr 100 200 400 600 and 800 khz figs 14 16 demonstrate the results of experiments results reveal that the adequate sampling rate for p1 is 400 khz while for p2 and p3 the pressure diagrams converge at 600 khz in addition it can be observed that for higher sampling rates the time duration of rising and falling of peak pressure say time duration occurs in a significant shorter duration rather than the frequency of 25 khz fig 17 depicts that the sampling rate not only affects the quantity but also alters the location of peak pressure for frequencies of 100 khz and lower p3 records the highest peak pressure whereas for higher rates the location of the highest peak pressure moves back to the p2 position 4 2 repeatability as mentioned in sec 2 these tests have been conducted on the test facilities being established in amirkabir laboratory of hydrodynamics the uncertainty analysis for experimental set up has already been performed for the wedge symmetry repeatability 3d effect and depth effect by barjasteh et al 2016 as far as current tests are considered due to very small deadrise angles further repetition of tests is required to capture any uncertainties of pressure records accompanied with the test results in this work each test is conducted at least three times to check the repeatability of the recorded data table 2 reports the repeatability test results for wedges of 5 and 10 deadrise angles for sr 25 and 1000 khz for 5 wedge the closer test to the mean value was earlier selected for presenting fig 11 it should be noted that results of a wedge of 5 deadrise angle have less repeatability in comparison with other wedges the main reason is attributed to the air cushion which inevitably and slightly changes the water surface level at the initial stage of penetration nonetheless the test results are fairly close to a reasonable repeatability a comparison between peak pressure variation due to repeatability and sampling rate is presented in table 3 for deadrise angle of 5 as an example generally one may define relative change for each sampling rate as follows 2 e s r p p e a k p p e a k a t s r 1000 k h z p p e a k a t s r 1000 k h z 100 3 e r e p m a x p p e a k p p e a k a v e r a g e p p e a k a v e r a g e 100 where e s r denotes the relative change of peak pressure compared to sr 1000 khz and e r e p denotes the maximum relative change of peak pressures compared to average peak pressure in repeatability test results results show that the relative change due to sampling rate e s r may rise as much as 54 while the maximum relative change due to repeatability e r e p is 7 additionally the relative change of repeatability appears randomly while the relative change due to sampling rates has a trend say bias on that basis it is concluded that the significant pressure variation in various sampling rates does not have any correlation with repeatability instead they are being influenced by the sampling rate effect 4 3 effects of air entrapment in figs 9 11 some oscillations were discernible after the peak value for wedges of 10 7 and 5 deadrise angles the frequencies of oscillation are presented in table 4 van nuffel et al 2014 also reported some oscillations of the impact pressure at the bottom of a cylinder he supposed that the oscillations might be originated from different physical phenomena including acoustic wave pressure vibrations and air cushion as far as the acoustic wave is concerned tank depth in all experiments is set to be 0 35 m given the speed of sound in water vw 1484 m s the acoustic reciprocating period can be calculated as follows 4 δ t 2 d v w 0 7 1484 0 471 m s this period is equivalent to the frequency of 2120 hz which is far lower than the frequency of oscillations thus there is not any rational connection between pressure oscillations and acoustic wave pressure another phenomenon that is likely to cause pressure oscillations is the structural vibration to investigate its effect on recorded pressure the acceleration of wedge with deadrise angle of 5 is also recorded fig 18 shows the time track of the acceleration at the location of pressure sensors the frequencies of the highest energy are 573 643 and 843 hz respectively which are determined by fft analysis the structural natural frequency of the body in water was recorded using hammering test and found to be 509 hz barjasteh et al 2016 the acceleration oscillation frequencies are different from the natural frequency of wedge structure additionally pressure oscillation frequencies given in table 4 are very high and far from the first natural frequency it should be noted that the structure does not vibrate with the higher modes while the first mode is not excited consequently it may be concluded that the pressure oscillations are irrelevant to the vibrations of the structure note that the effect of elasticity on the recorded pressure depends on the arrangement and strength of the structure of the wedge under consideration the authors have intentionally used a thick steel plate to control the hydroelastic effect on the pressure record other researchers must consider the interactions between pressure and structural deformation individually according to the structure of their test set up lin and shieh 1997 assumed that the high frequency oscillations of pressure during cylinder water entry are likely due to air cushion van nuffel et al 2014 employed a high speed camera and verified this possibility detailed examination of the role of aeration in flat plate water entry by mai 2017 showed that compression and expansion of the trapped air bubbles caused the pressure oscillations to consider this phenomenon a high speed camera is employed to visualize the entry of a wedge of 5 deadrise angles the bottom view of the entrapped air is captured at 1000 fps and illustrated in fig 19 the white spots show the entrapped air moving toward the chines as the wedge gradually penetrates into the water the sensor p1 is located at a region closer to the apex say closer to initial air bubbles and records higher oscillations in comparison with p2 and p3 thus the pressure oscillations may occur due to air bubble entrapment as far as pressure oscillations of high deadrise angle wedges say 25 30 and 35 are concerned they are due to mains frequency 5 conclusions in this paper a detailed survey has been performed in order to study the sampling rate effect on pressure recorded by water entry experiments an assortment of wedges with various deadrise angles ranging from 5 to 35 was dropped into water and pressure were recorded with different sampling rates experiments reveal that using inappropriate sampling rate may yield to erroneous results and unreliable outcomes particularly the magnitude of peak pressures in addition it may misreport the location of maximum peak pressure on wedges to avoid misevaluation some thresholds of sampling rate were determined for different wedges it was found that for wedges with deadrise angles of 25 and higher a sampling rate of 25 khz is adequate this sampling rate however is not appropriate for deadrise angles lower than 20 where a higher rate is needed results indicate that the acceptable sampling rate for a wedge of 5 deadrise angle is 600 khz it should be noted that these thresholds could be applied to all water entry experiments on wedges having drop heights up to 0 50 m say the impact velocity of 3 13 m s for higher impact velocities the validity of the above mentioned thresholds has to be verified by conducting a similar study the general conclusion of this study is that a set of sampling rate independency test is required for each water entry test configuration

expressions of hydrodynamic derivatives that can be used in mmg model are given keywords onr tumblehome oblique towing hydrodynamic derivatives advancing speed mmg model 1 introduction ship maneuverability is the ability of a ship to keep or change its state of motion under the operations of rudder and propeller which plays a critical role in relation to navigation safety and economy of a ship it includes inherent dynamic stability course keeping stability initial turning ability yaw checking ability turning ability and stopping ability to evaluate ship maneuverability the standards for ship maneuverability were proposed by the imo international maritime organization and various kind of standard maneuvers such as turning test zig zag test stopping test pull out test et al were proposed to yield significant quantities according to the imo standards for ship maneuverability maneuvering performance of a ship should be designed to comply with the standards at the design stage therefore the prediction of the ship maneuvering performance should be conducted at the early design stage generally speaking there are two methods for this purpose specifically the free running model tests or the captive model tests together with mathematical models and with the progress of cfd computational fluid dynamics techniques and hpc high performance computers numerical simulations are widely used in the predictions of ship maneuvering carrica et al 2013 shen et al 2015 mofidi and carrica 2014 sadat hosseini et al 2014 broglia et al 2015 performed numerical simulations of free running tests such as turning and zig zag tests of various hull forms and the predicted results are in good agreement with experimental model tests as for mathematical models the ship maneuvering motions can be expressed as an ordinary differential equation which is derived according to the newton second law in the equation there are two methods for expression of the external forces and moments acting on the ship one called abkowitz model as is proposed in abkowitz 1964 is based on taylor series expansions with the hydrodynamic forces and moments expressed as functions of kinematical parameters and rudder angle the other one called mmg mathematical modeling group model is first introduced in ogawa et al 1977 in this model the hydrodynamic forces and moments are decomposed into three parts i e the parts acting on the hull the propeller and the rudder compared to abkowitz model the main advantage of the mmg model is that all the hydrodynamic derivatives used in the model have explicit physical meanings which makes it easier for a clear understanding of ship maneuvering motions the hydrodynamic derivatives used both in the abkowitz and mmg model can be determined through captive model tests specifically speaking the oblique towing tests circular motion tests and dynamic pmm tests mucha and el moctar 2015 predicted maneuverability of a mariner a tanker and a ferry ship using abkowitz model with the hydrodynamic derivatives yielded from model tests sung and park 2015 he et al 2016 performed maneuvering predictions using mmg model based on cfd generated derivatives as illustrated in the literature there are some differences between predictions obtained from mathematical models and free running model tests but considering the high efficiency of the mathematical model it is also widely used in the early design stage of ships the present work is based on the mmg model and a brief introduction will be given hereinafter 1 1 mmg model the mmg model is a simplified mathematical model for solving ship maneuvering problems it was first proposed in ogawa et al 1977 by a research group called maneuvering modeling group in japanese towing tank conference jttc to date considerable simulation methods based on the mmg model for ship maneuvering have been presented on the purpose of avoiding inadaptability of hydrodynamic derivatives to different modified methods in yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 an mmg standard method for ship maneuvering predictions was proposed the study in this paper was based on this method and a brief introduction of this method will be given in the following text fig 1 shows the coordinate system used in this article o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 is the earth fixed coordinate system where x 0 y 0 plane coincides with the still water surface and the z 0 axis points downward o x y z is the body fixed coordinate system with the origin o taken at the center of gravity of the ship and the x y z axes point respectively towards the bow the starboard and downward u u 2 v 2 represents the advancing speed of the ship and u v denote the velocity components along x y axes β denotes the drift angle of the ship and is defined as β arctan v u r p are the yaw rate and roll rate of the ship and ψ φ denote the heading angle and rolling angle as described in yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 the hydrodynamic forces acting on the ship can be expressed as eqn 1 1 x x h x r x p y y h y r y p n n h n r n p where the subscript h r p represent hull rudder and propeller respectively in present work the hydrodynamic forces acting on the bare hull are investigated and it is expressed as eqn 2 2 x h r 0 x v v v 2 x v r v r x r r r r x v v v v v 4 y h y v v y r r y v v v v 3 y v v r v 2 r y v r r v r 2 y r r r r 3 n h n v v n r r n v v v v 3 n v v r v 2 r n v r r v r 2 n r r r r 3 in eqn 2 x v v x v r x r r x v v v v y v y r y v v v y v v r y v r r y r r r n v n r n v v v n v v r n v r r n r r r are hydrodynamic derivatives where x v v x

pure yaw and pure sway tests or circular motion test in the present work we will mainly discuss hydrodynamic forces related to lateral velocity v and both experimental and numerical oblique towing tests were conducted so that all the hydrodynamic derivatives related to yaw rate r can be eliminated as is stated in the introduction all the hydrodynamic derivatives used in the mmg model have explicit physical meanings hydrodynamic derivatives related to lateral velocity v which are obtained through the oblique towing test mean the force or moment induced by a unit component of velocity along y axis in maneuvering motions however all the hydrodynamic derivatives are deduced at the initial state with a certain value of forwarding speed and will remain constant during maneuvering motions as is illustrated in liu et al 2017 a significant amount of speed loss occurs during maneuvering motions like full turning or zig zag motions both in free running model tests and sea trials as a result it is theoretically inappropriate to treat all the hydrodynamic derivates invariant as used to in the mmg standard model in simonsen and stern 2014 the oblique towing tests of the dtmb 5415 hull were performed at 4 different towing speed but the specific relationship between towing speed and hydrodynamic derivatives was not given the purpose of this article is to investigate the effects of advancing speed on hydrodynamic derivatives and yield an expression between them at small value of lateral velocity v the relationship between hydrodynamic forces and lateral velocity is roughly linear so the nonlinear term like x v v v v y v v v n v v v can be neglected and only three linear hydrodynamic derivatives x v v y v n v need to be considered accordingly eqn 1 can be rewritten as eqn 3 in the present work 3 x x h r 0 u x v v u v 2 y y h y v u v n n h n v u v 2 outline of model tests 2 1 geometry and general parameters in this work the onr tumblehome onrt bare hull which is the 2015 tokyo cfd workshop benchmark hull form without bilge keels twin rudders and propellers is considered the test model is made of wood and is illustrated in fig 2 of which the scale ratio is λ 1 30 the general ship parameters are listed in table 1 2 2 experiment setup the pmm model tests were carried out in marine design and research intitute of china maric maric s towing tank is 280 m long 10 m wide and 5 m deep the maximum speed of the towing carriage is 9 m s and the accuracy of towing speed is about 0 1 of the maximum speed the planar motion mechanism used in the model test is shown in fig 2 of which the maximum amplitude of sway and yaw motion are respectively 0 75 m and 45 the mechanism is mainly composed of three part specifically a computer controlled transverse system that controls the amplitude and period of sway motion a rotation module that controls the amplitude and period of yaw motion and a slideway which connects the hull model with force transducers during the pmm model test the mechanism carrying the hull model was connected to the towing carriage the hull model was free to trim and sink otherwise constrained the longitudinal force x transverse force y and yaw moment n were measured by two 2 component gauges two force transducers were symmetrically placed respect to the center of gravity of the hull model with 1 6 m separation the experimental measurements will also be 2019 simman workshop s benchmark data in order to ensure the accuracy of the drift angle in oblique towing tests and pure sway yaw motion amplitude the planar motion mechanism was calibrated at first several drift angles several periods of pure sway and pure yaw motions were tested before the mechanism was mounted onto the towing carriage and then two force transducers were calibrated before installed on the slideway of the mechanism the distance between two force transducers on the slideway was set as 1 6 m likewise two supports were placed along the centerline of the ship hull with 1 6 m separation and two supports are located symmetrically with respect to the center of gravity of the hull then the planar motion mechanism was mounted onto the carriage the discrepancy between the mechanism s support plane and the carriage s back surface at eight points are controlled the same by eight screws that ensures these two surface parallel planes last the vertical position of the slideway was adjusted and two force transducers were connected to two supports on the hull 2 3 review of test conditions in the model test both static pmm tests oblique towing and dynamic pmm tests pure sway pure yaw pure yaw with constant drift angles are carried out in this work the authors mainly discuss three hydrodynamic derivatives x v v y v n v so only the static oblique towing tests are considered the tests conditions are listed in table 2 where indicates the conditions have been repeated 10 times for uncertainty analysis and in tests 1 9 drift angles both to the port side and the starboard side are performed to yield the corrected data for symmetry with respect to the straight ahead towing direction such that 4 χ m χ χ 2 where χ m is the corrected data for any data variable χ x y n and χ or χ is the data χ respectively measured at positive or negative drift angle β and all the measured variables are time averaged cause the carriage speed oscillated during the towing tests besides to analyze the effects of the advancing speed during pmm model tests on the hydrodynamic derivatives two advancing speed u 1 418 m s and u 0 709 m s are considered 3 computational overview 3 1 simulation approach and case setup all the numerical calculations are based on the open source cfd library openfoam the two phase incompressible isothermal immiscible fluids solver interdymfoam which use vof volume of fluid a phase fraction based interface capturing approach is used the governing equation unsteady reynolds average navier stokes equation urans is solved using the pimple coupled simple and piso algorithm to decouple pressure and velocity and the multidimensional universal limiter for explicit solution mules is used to solve the vof equation as for discretization schemes the temporal term is discretized using second order backward scheme the convective terms are discretized with the blended 75 linear and 25 second order upwind scheme which is called lust in openfoam and the diffusion terms are discretized with second order linear scheme the computational domain is 1 l w l 3 l w l 1 5 l w l 1 5 l w l 1 l w l 0 5 l w l in x y z directions respectively the computational grids are generated in three steps firstly the openfoam utility blockmesh is used to generate background grid secondly refinemesh is applied to make a refinement of the free surface region and near hull region last snappyhexmesh is used to generate the body fitted grid and boundary layers the thickness of the first grid layer is set as 0 0018 m to ensure the non dimensional distance y within the range 30 100 as is required by the standard wall function employed for the ship hull surface for all the computational cases the minimum grid size in z direction is δ z 0 001 l w l to capture waves generated by the ship and numerical time step is δ t 0 001 s computational domain geometry and boundary conditions are illustrated in fig 3 3 2 computational conditions table 3 shows the computational cases conditions a grid convergence and turbulence model study is performed in cases 1 10 for which three grid resolutions c m f short for coarse medium and fine and two turbulence models sst des short for komegasst and komegasstdes proposed in menter and esch 2001 menter et al 2003 are used the number of cells for c m f three grid levels are 3 5 million 6 million and 11 million with a refinement ratio of 2 in x y z three directions except for grid size at the free surface region where δ z is 0 001 l w l for all three grid resolutions fig 4 illustrates the computational grids at the bow and stern region of the fine level grid which shows that the wake region is refined to capture the flow separation and vortex shedding and the results of different turbulence models specifically komegasst and komegasstdes will demonstrate how turbulence model affects the simulation accuracy simulation results of cases 1 17 and 22 25 will be compared with the experimental measurements for validation purpose and in cases 18 21 and 26 29 two more advancing speed are considered to figure out the relationship between advancing speed u and the hydrodynamic derivatives x v v y v n v 3 3 grid convergence and turbulence model study as is mentioned in the previous setion cases 1 10 are performed for grid convergence and turbulence model study the results are compared with experimental measurements of the corresponding test conditions in fig 5 figures in the first row demonstrate the results of cases 1 6 with drift angle β 10 as is illustrated the numerical simulations of longitudinal force x lateral force y and moment along z axis n are basically within the 5 error bands of experimental measurements and results predicted by komegasstdes model have bigger discrepancy with experimental measurements than that given by komegasst model especially when coarse and medium grids are used therefore we can conclude that for the case with medium drift angle in this case β 10 komegasst turbulence model can capture the dominant flow features and is accurate enough besides komegasstdes turbulence model needs higher resolution grid to yield accurate results the second row of fig 5 shows the results of cases 7 10 with drift angle β 20 as we can see the numerical predictions of longitudinal force x and lateral force y are all within the 5 error bands of experimental measurements in contrast the relative error of yaw moment n is slightly larger particularly for komegasst cases but overall the numerical results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental measurements and komegasstdes turbulence model can give more accurate results of forces and moment based on the grid convergence and turbulence model study the grid resolution and turbulence model used in other cases are determined as is listed in table 3 for cases 16 17 with high advancing speed and large drift angle β 10 the calculations are performed using komegasstdes turbulence model and fine grid and for cases 11 15 18 29 with low advancing speed or small drift angle β 10 the komegasst turbulence model and medium grid are used we have to mention that the fine grid used in this work may not be fine enough for komegasstdes turbulence model as is described in stern et al 2015 for static drift case the des predictions improved when the grid points is refined beyond 84 million but in this paper to balance computing efficiency and accuracy only 11 million cells are used for the fine grid 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation of numerical prediction fig 6 and fig 7 show calculated hydrodynamic forces x y and moment n in comparison with experimental measurements at two different advancing speed u 1 418 m s and u 0 709 m s in fig 6 efd denotes the experimental data as expressed in eqn 4 where χ and χ respectively correspond to data measured at positive and negative drift angle and cfd denotes numerical results given by cases 1 17 the 10 error bands are relative to the experimental data fig 7 shows experimental measurements and numerical results obtained from tests 10 18 and cases 22 25 in fig 7 efd denotes experimental data measured at positive drift angle and cfd denotes numerical predictions for longitudinal force x the discrepancy between experimental data and calculated data is a little bit large especially for cases with small drift angles β 10 as is illustrated the measured longitudinal force oscillate a lot over drift angle particularly for cases with lower advancing speed u 0 709 m s and the absolute value of longitudinal force is relatively small so the mechanism vibration or towing speed instability may cause a large uncertainty for the measured data furthermore the measurement range of the force sensor applied in the experiments is 500n and its accuracy is 0 3 of measurement range which is 1 5n however the absolute error between cfd results and efd measurements is about 1n generally speaking the longitudinal force x is reasonably predicted as for lateral force y and moment along z axis n the numerical predictions are basically within the 10 error bands of experimental measurements at both small and large drift angles so it can be concluded that the cfd solver numerical methods and computational grids work well for this problem and the following study will be performed based on numerical predictions 4 2 detail flow fields analysis fig 8 illustrate the cross sections of flow field where the local velocity component along x axis u x is smaller than 95 of advancing speed u of cases 1 17 with u 1 418 m s the cross sections are colored by vorticity magnitude the ship hull is colored by dynamic pressure p ρ g h and the free surface is colored by z coordinate value as is shown in the figure at small drift angle β 2 there is one series of vortex generated by the sonar dome hereafter called vortex a as for medium drift angles β 4 6 8 there are two sets of vortex vortex a and vortex induced by the skeg hereafter called vortex b and with increasing of the drift angle the vorticity strength substantially increased concerning big drift angles β 10 12 16 20 besides vortex a and vortex b another series of vortex is generated by the ship hull hereafter called vortex c vortex c is due to flow separation in the lateral direction and with increasing of drift angle the separation point moves to the bow and central longitudinal section of the ship hull as presented in literature xing et al 2012 jin et al 2016 abbas and kornev 2016 the komegasst model smooth the flow features too much that is incapable to capture the unsteady vortex and flow separation accurately and the komegasstdes model may overestimate the vortex strength as for the wave pattern we can also find the same phenomenon as abbas and kornev 2016 that komegasst model smooth the ship wave especially in the wake core region but komegasstdes model can capture the unsteady wake effects 5 advancing speed effects on hydrodynamic derivatives fig 9 illustrate the numerically predicted non dimensional longitudinal force plus resistance x r 0 r 0 with respect to square of lateral velocity v 2 g l w l non dimensional lateral force y m g and yaw moment n m g l w l with respect to lateral velocity v g l w l of cases 11 14 and 18 29 as is described in eqn 5 x r 0 r 0 has a linear correlation with v 2 g l w l and y m g n m g l w l have a linear correlation with v g l w l consequently the hydrodynamic derivatives or the slopes of all the curves can be yielded by a linear regression which are listed in table 4 5 x r 0 u r 0 u x v v u r 0 u g l w l v 2 g l w l x v v v 2 g l w l y m g y v u m g g l w l v g l w l y v v g l w l n m g l w l n v u m g l w l g l w l v g l w l n v v g l w l it is obvious that the hydrodynamic derivatives of the onrt ship hull vary a lot for different advancing speeds fig 10 illustrates the relationship between dimensionless advancing speed u u g l w l and hydrodynamic derivatives x v v y v n v where the scatters correspond to hydrodynamic derivatives yielded from fig 9 and the solid lines are fitted curves of hydrodynamic derivatives based on the least square method for x v v with the decrease of advancing speed the ship resistance r 0 u reduce to zero and then because of the asymmetry of ship bow and stern the magnitude of x v v u 0 is not zero so the magnitude of x v v approaches infinite accordingly we assume the hydrodynamic derivative x v v in the form of x v v 1 u 2 a u b where the coefficients a b determined via least square method are a 7 1 b 0 3 respectively y v n v vary linearly with the advancing speed that can be assumed in the form of y v k y u c y and n v k n u c n likewise the coefficients k y c y k n c n are determined by least square method that k y 0 906 c y 0 08 k n 0 706 c n 0 006 so we can concluded that the hydrodynamic derivatives of the onrt hull specifically x v v y v n v vary greatly for different advancing speed and can be expressed as eqn 6 6 x v v u 1 u 2 7 1 u 0 3 y v u 0 906 u 0 08 n v u 0 706 u 0 006 in order to figure out the effects of advancing speed on the vortex structures fig 11 demonstrates the cross sections of flow field where the local velocity component along x axis u x is smaller than 95 of advancing speed u the results are from cases 29 25 21 14 with four different advancing speed respectively u 0 425 m s 0 709 m s 1 063 m s 1 418 m s and the same lateral velocity v 0 147 m s the same as fig 8 the cross sections are coloured by vorticity magnitude the ship hull is coloured by dynamic pressure p ρ g h and the free surface is coloured by z coordinate value due to the difference on drift angle vortex structures of the four cases varies considerably for lower advancing speed cases u 0 425 m s and u 0 709 m s vortex a b c exist and vortex a is away from the ship hull at the stern region for higher advancing speed cases u 1 063 m s and u 1 418 m s there are two sets of vortex vortex a b and for the case u 1 418 m s vortex a is still near the ship hull at the stern region that will influence the pressure distribution and lead to larger lateral force and yaw moment with the increasing of the advancing speed u the vortex strength increases and the wave elevation grows all these factors are the basic reasons that yield different hydrodynamic forces and moment acting on the ship hull at different advancing speed 6 conclusions in this paper experimental and numerical methods are used to perform oblique towing tests of the onrt hull first the grid convergence and tubulence model study are performed for cases with medium drift angle β 10 and large drift angle β 20 and then based on these results the grid resolution and turbulence model used for other cases are determined for validation purpose the numerical predictions of hydrodynamic forces and moment are compared with experimental measurements for cases with two advancing speed u 0 709 m s and u 1 418 m s and for most cases the numerical results of longitudinal force x lateral force y and moment along z axis n are within the 10 error bands of the experimental measurements thus the cfd solver numerical methods and computing grids are proved accurate enough to simulate this problem by analyzing the detail flow fields around the ship hull at different drift angles we find that when the ship is towing with low drift angle β 2 vortex a is generated by the sonar dome and for the cases with medium drift angle β 4 6 8 vortex b is induced by the skeg when the drift angle β 10 flow separation in the lateral direction happens and vortex c generated by the ship hull becomes the dominant feature that affects the pressure distributions on the ship hull last a numerical study of the advancing speed effects on hydrodynamic derivatives is performed oblique towing tests at four advancing speed u 0 425 m s 0 709 m s 1 063 m s 1 418 m s are considered and three major hydrodynamic derivatives x v v y v n v at different advancing speed are studied we find that the relationship between x v v and u u g l w l is x v v 1 u 2 a u b where a b can be determined via least square method for the onrt model considered in this paper a 7 1 b 0 3 and y v n v have a linear correlation with advancing speed that y v k y u c y n v k n u c n based on the least square method value of these

maneuverability is the ability of a ship to keep or change its state of motion under the operations of rudder and propeller which plays a critical role in relation to navigation safety and economy of a ship it includes inherent dynamic stability course keeping stability initial turning ability yaw checking ability turning ability and stopping ability to evaluate ship maneuverability the standards for ship maneuverability were proposed by the imo international maritime organization and various kind of standard maneuvers such as turning test zig zag test stopping test pull out test et al were proposed to yield significant quantities according to the imo standards for ship maneuverability maneuvering performance of a ship should be designed to comply with the standards at the design stage therefore the prediction of the ship maneuvering performance should be conducted at the early design stage generally speaking there are two methods for this purpose specifically the free running model tests or the captive model tests together with mathematical models and with the progress of cfd computational fluid dynamics techniques and hpc high performance computers numerical simulations are widely used in the predictions of ship maneuvering carrica et al 2013 shen et al 2015 mofidi and carrica 2014 sadat hosseini et al 2014 broglia et al 2015 performed numerical simulations of free running tests such as turning and zig zag tests of various hull forms and the predicted results are in good agreement with experimental model tests as for mathematical models the ship maneuvering motions can be expressed as an ordinary differential equation which is derived according to the newton second law in the equation there are two methods for expression of the external forces and moments acting on the ship one called abkowitz model as is proposed in abkowitz 1964 is based on taylor series expansions with the hydrodynamic forces and moments expressed as functions of kinematical parameters and rudder angle the other one called mmg mathematical modeling group model is first introduced in ogawa et al 1977 in this model the hydrodynamic forces and moments are decomposed into three parts i e the parts acting on the hull the propeller and the rudder compared to abkowitz model the main advantage of the mmg model is that all the hydrodynamic derivatives used in the model have explicit physical meanings which makes it easier for a clear understanding of ship maneuvering motions the hydrodynamic derivatives used both in the abkowitz and mmg model can be determined through captive model tests specifically speaking the oblique towing tests circular motion tests and dynamic pmm tests mucha and el moctar 2015 predicted maneuverability of a mariner a tanker and a ferry ship using abkowitz model with the hydrodynamic derivatives yielded from model tests sung and park 2015 he et al 2016 performed maneuvering predictions using mmg model based on cfd generated derivatives as illustrated in the literature there are some differences between predictions obtained from mathematical models and free running model tests but considering the high efficiency of the mathematical model it is also widely used in the early design stage of ships the present work is based on the mmg model and a brief introduction will be given hereinafter 1 1 mmg model the mmg model is a simplified mathematical model for solving ship maneuvering problems it was first proposed in ogawa et al 1977 by a research group called maneuvering modeling group in japanese towing tank conference jttc to date considerable simulation methods based on the mmg model for ship maneuvering have been presented on the purpose of avoiding inadaptability of hydrodynamic derivatives to different modified methods in yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 an mmg standard method for ship maneuvering predictions was proposed the study in this paper was based on this method and a brief introduction of this method will be given in the following text fig 1 shows the coordinate system used in this article o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 is the earth fixed coordinate system where x 0 y 0 plane coincides with the still water surface and the z 0 axis points downward o x y z is the body fixed coordinate system with the origin o taken at the center of gravity of the ship and the x y z axes point respectively towards the bow the starboard and downward u u 2 v 2 represents the advancing speed of the ship and u v denote the velocity components along x y axes β denotes the drift angle of the ship and is defined as β arctan v u r p are the yaw rate and roll rate of the ship and ψ φ denote the heading angle and rolling angle as described in yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 the hydrodynamic forces acting on the ship can be expressed as eqn 1 1 x x h x r x p y y h y r y p n n h n r n p where the subscript h r p represent hull rudder and propeller respectively in present work the hydrodynamic forces acting on the bare hull are investigated and it is expressed as eqn 2 2 x h r 0 x v v v 2 x v r v r x r r r r x v v v v v 4 y h y v v y r r y v v v v 3 y v v r v 2 r y v r r v r 2 y r r r r 3 n h n v v n r r n v v v v 3 n v v r v 2 r n v r r v r 2 n r r r r 3 in eqn 2 x v v x v r x r r x v v v v y v y r y v v v y v v r y v r r y r r r n v n r n v v v n v v r n v r r n r r r are hydrodynamic derivatives where x v v x

pure yaw and pure sway tests or circular motion test in the present work we will mainly discuss hydrodynamic forces related to lateral velocity v and both experimental and numerical oblique towing tests were conducted so that all the hydrodynamic derivatives related to yaw rate r can be eliminated as is stated in the introduction all the hydrodynamic derivatives used in the mmg model have explicit physical meanings hydrodynamic derivatives related to lateral velocity v which are obtained through the oblique towing test mean the force or moment induced by a unit component of velocity along y axis in maneuvering motions however all the hydrodynamic derivatives are deduced at the initial state with a certain value of forwarding speed and will remain constant during maneuvering motions as is illustrated in liu et al 2017 a significant amount of speed loss occurs during maneuvering motions like full turning or zig zag motions both in free running model tests and sea trials as a result it is theoretically inappropriate to treat all the hydrodynamic derivates invariant as used to in the mmg standard model in simonsen and stern 2014 the oblique towing tests of the dtmb 5415 hull were performed at 4 different towing speed but the specific relationship between towing speed and hydrodynamic derivatives was not given the purpose of this article is to investigate the effects of advancing speed on hydrodynamic derivatives and yield an expression between them at small value of lateral velocity v the relationship between hydrodynamic forces and lateral velocity is roughly linear so the nonlinear term like x v v v v y v v v n v v v can be neglected and only three linear hydrodynamic derivatives x v v y v n v need to be considered accordingly eqn 1 can be rewritten as eqn 3 in the present work 3 x x h r 0 u x v v u v 2 y y h y v u v n n h n v u v 2 outline of model tests 2 1 geometry and general parameters in this work the onr tumblehome onrt bare hull which is the 2015 tokyo cfd workshop benchmark hull form without bilge keels twin rudders and propellers is considered the test model is made of wood and is illustrated in fig 2 of which the scale ratio is λ 1 30 the general ship parameters are listed in table 1 2 2 experiment setup the pmm model tests were carried out in marine design and research intitute of china maric maric s towing tank is 280 m long 10 m wide and 5 m deep the maximum speed of the towing carriage is 9 m s and the accuracy of towing speed is about 0 1 of the maximum speed the planar motion mechanism used in the model test is shown in fig 2 of which the maximum amplitude of sway and yaw motion are respectively 0 75 m and 45 the mechanism is mainly composed of three part specifically a computer controlled transverse system that controls the amplitude and period of sway motion a rotation module that controls the amplitude and period of yaw motion and a slideway which connects the hull model with force transducers during the pmm model test the mechanism carrying the hull model was connected to the towing carriage the hull model was free to trim and sink otherwise constrained the longitudinal force x transverse force y and yaw moment n were measured by two 2 component gauges two force transducers were symmetrically placed respect to the center of gravity of the hull model with 1 6 m separation the experimental measurements will also be 2019 simman workshop s benchmark data in order to ensure the accuracy of the drift angle in oblique towing tests and pure sway yaw motion amplitude the planar motion mechanism was calibrated at first several drift angles several periods of pure sway and pure yaw motions were tested before the mechanism was mounted onto the towing carriage and then two force transducers were calibrated before installed on the slideway of the mechanism the distance between two force transducers on the slideway was set as 1 6 m likewise two supports were placed along the centerline of the ship hull with 1 6 m separation and two supports are located symmetrically with respect to the center of gravity of the hull then the planar motion mechanism was mounted onto the carriage the discrepancy between the mechanism s support plane and the carriage s back surface at eight points are controlled the same by eight screws that ensures these two surface parallel planes last the vertical position of the slideway was adjusted and two force transducers were connected to two supports on the hull 2 3 review of test conditions in the model test both static pmm tests oblique towing and dynamic pmm tests pure sway pure yaw pure yaw with constant drift angles are carried out in this work the authors mainly discuss three hydrodynamic derivatives x v v y v n v so only the static oblique towing tests are considered the tests conditions are listed in table 2 where indicates the conditions have been repeated 10 times for uncertainty analysis and in tests 1 9 drift angles both to the port side and the starboard side are performed to yield the corrected data for symmetry with respect to the straight ahead towing direction such that 4 χ m χ χ 2 where χ m is the corrected data for any data variable χ x y n and χ or χ is the data χ respectively measured at positive or negative drift angle β and all the measured variables are time averaged cause the carriage speed oscillated during the towing tests besides to analyze the effects of the advancing speed during pmm model tests on the hydrodynamic derivatives two advancing speed u 1 418 m s and u 0 709 m s are considered 3 computational overview 3 1 simulation approach and case setup all the numerical calculations are based on the open source cfd library openfoam the two phase incompressible isothermal immiscible fluids solver interdymfoam which use vof volume of fluid a phase fraction based interface capturing approach is used the governing equation unsteady reynolds average navier stokes equation urans is solved using the pimple coupled simple and piso algorithm to decouple pressure and velocity and the multidimensional universal limiter for explicit solution mules is used to solve the vof equation as for discretization schemes the temporal term is discretized using second order backward scheme the convective terms are discretized with the blended 75 linear and 25 second order upwind scheme which is called lust in openfoam and the diffusion terms are discretized with second order linear scheme the computational domain is 1 l w l 3 l w l 1 5 l w l 1 5 l w l 1 l w l 0 5 l w l in x y z directions respectively the computational grids are generated in three steps firstly the openfoam utility blockmesh is used to generate background grid secondly refinemesh is applied to make a refinement of the free surface region and near hull region last snappyhexmesh is used to generate the body fitted grid and boundary layers the thickness of the first grid layer is set as 0 0018 m to ensure the non dimensional distance y within the range 30 100 as is required by the standard wall function employed for the ship hull surface for all the computational cases the minimum grid size in z direction is δ z 0 001 l w l to capture waves generated by the ship and numerical time step is δ t 0 001 s computational domain geometry and boundary conditions are illustrated in fig 3 3 2 computational conditions table 3 shows the computational cases conditions a grid convergence and turbulence model study is performed in cases 1 10 for which three grid resolutions c m f short for coarse medium and fine and two turbulence models sst des short for komegasst and komegasstdes proposed in menter and esch 2001 menter et al 2003 are used the number of cells for c m f three grid levels are 3 5 million 6 million and 11 million with a refinement ratio of 2 in x y z three directions except for grid size at the free surface region where δ z is 0 001 l w l for all three grid resolutions fig 4 illustrates the computational grids at the bow and stern region of the fine level grid which shows that the wake region is refined to capture the flow separation and vortex shedding and the results of different turbulence models specifically komegasst and komegasstdes will demonstrate how turbulence model affects the simulation accuracy simulation results of cases 1 17 and 22 25 will be compared with the experimental measurements for validation purpose and in cases 18 21 and 26 29 two more advancing speed are considered to figure out the relationship between advancing speed u and the hydrodynamic derivatives x v v y v n v 3 3 grid convergence and turbulence model study as is mentioned in the previous setion cases 1 10 are performed for grid convergence and turbulence model study the results are compared with experimental measurements of the corresponding test conditions in fig 5 figures in the first row demonstrate the results of cases 1 6 with drift angle β 10 as is illustrated the numerical simulations of longitudinal force x lateral force y and moment along z axis n are basically within the 5 error bands of experimental measurements and results predicted by komegasstdes model have bigger discrepancy with experimental measurements than that given by komegasst model especially when coarse and medium grids are used therefore we can conclude that for the case with medium drift angle in this case β 10 komegasst turbulence model can capture the dominant flow features and is accurate enough besides komegasstdes turbulence model needs higher resolution grid to yield accurate results the second row of fig 5 shows the results of cases 7 10 with drift angle β 20 as we can see the numerical predictions of longitudinal force x and lateral force y are all within the 5 error bands of experimental measurements in contrast the relative error of yaw moment n is slightly larger particularly for komegasst cases but overall the numerical results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental measurements and komegasstdes turbulence model can give more accurate results of forces and moment based on the grid convergence and turbulence model study the grid resolution and turbulence model used in other cases are determined as is listed in table 3 for cases 16 17 with high advancing speed and large drift angle β 10 the calculations are performed using komegasstdes turbulence model and fine grid and for cases 11 15 18 29 with low advancing speed or small drift angle β 10 the komegasst turbulence model and medium grid are used we have to mention that the fine grid used in this work may not be fine enough for komegasstdes turbulence model as is described in stern et al 2015 for static drift case the des predictions improved when the grid points is refined beyond 84 million but in this paper to balance computing efficiency and accuracy only 11 million cells are used for the fine grid 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation of numerical prediction fig 6 and fig 7 show calculated hydrodynamic forces x y and moment n in comparison with experimental measurements at two different advancing speed u 1 418 m s and u 0 709 m s in fig 6 efd denotes the experimental data as expressed in eqn 4 where χ and χ respectively correspond to data measured at positive and negative drift angle and cfd denotes numerical results given by cases 1 17 the 10 error bands are relative to the experimental data fig 7 shows experimental measurements and numerical results obtained from tests 10 18 and cases 22 25 in fig 7 efd denotes experimental data measured at positive drift angle and cfd denotes numerical predictions for longitudinal force x the discrepancy between experimental data and calculated data is a little bit large especially for cases with small drift angles β 10 as is illustrated the measured longitudinal force oscillate a lot over drift angle particularly for cases with lower advancing speed u 0 709 m s and the absolute value of longitudinal force is relatively small so the mechanism vibration or towing speed instability may cause a large uncertainty for the measured data furthermore the measurement range of the force sensor applied in the experiments is 500n and its accuracy is 0 3 of measurement range which is 1 5n however the absolute error between cfd results and efd measurements is about 1n generally speaking the longitudinal force x is reasonably predicted as for lateral force y and moment along z axis n the numerical predictions are basically within the 10 error bands of experimental measurements at both small and large drift angles so it can be concluded that the cfd solver numerical methods and computational grids work well for this problem and the following study will be performed based on numerical predictions 4 2 detail flow fields analysis fig 8 illustrate the cross sections of flow field where the local velocity component along x axis u x is smaller than 95 of advancing speed u of cases 1 17 with u 1 418 m s the cross sections are colored by vorticity magnitude the ship hull is colored by dynamic pressure p ρ g h and the free surface is colored by z coordinate value as is shown in the figure at small drift angle β 2 there is one series of vortex generated by the sonar dome hereafter called vortex a as for medium drift angles β 4 6 8 there are two sets of vortex vortex a and vortex induced by the skeg hereafter called vortex b and with increasing of the drift angle the vorticity strength substantially increased concerning big drift angles β 10 12 16 20 besides vortex a and vortex b another series of vortex is generated by the ship hull hereafter called vortex c vortex c is due to flow separation in the lateral direction and with increasing of drift angle the separation point moves to the bow and central longitudinal section of the ship hull as presented in literature xing et al 2012 jin et al 2016 abbas and kornev 2016 the komegasst model smooth the flow features too much that is incapable to capture the unsteady vortex and flow separation accurately and the komegasstdes model may overestimate the vortex strength as for the wave pattern we can also find the same phenomenon as abbas and kornev 2016 that komegasst model smooth the ship wave especially in the wake core region but komegasstdes model can capture the unsteady wake effects 5 advancing speed effects on hydrodynamic derivatives fig 9 illustrate the numerically predicted non dimensional longitudinal force plus resistance x r 0 r 0 with respect to square of lateral velocity v 2 g l w l non dimensional lateral force y m g and yaw moment n m g l w l with respect to lateral velocity v g l w l of cases 11 14 and 18 29 as is described in eqn 5 x r 0 r 0 has a linear correlation with v 2 g l w l and y m g n m g l w l have a linear correlation with v g l w l consequently the hydrodynamic derivatives or the slopes of all the curves can be yielded by a linear regression which are listed in table 4 5 x r 0 u r 0 u x v v u r 0 u g l w l v 2 g l w l x v v v 2 g l w l y m g y v u m g g l w l v g l w l y v v g l w l n m g l w l n v u m g l w l g l w l v g l w l n v v g l w l it is obvious that the hydrodynamic derivatives of the onrt ship hull vary a lot for different advancing speeds fig 10 illustrates the relationship between dimensionless advancing speed u u g l w l and hydrodynamic derivatives x v v y v n v where the scatters correspond to hydrodynamic derivatives yielded from fig 9 and the solid lines are fitted curves of hydrodynamic derivatives based on the least square method for x v v with the decrease of advancing speed the ship resistance r 0 u reduce to zero and then because of the asymmetry of ship bow and stern the magnitude of x v v u 0 is not zero so the magnitude of x v v approaches infinite accordingly we assume the hydrodynamic derivative x v v in the form of x v v 1 u 2 a u b where the coefficients a b determined via least square method are a 7 1 b 0 3 respectively y v n v vary linearly with the advancing speed that can be assumed in the form of y v k y u c y and n v k n u c n likewise the coefficients k y c y k n c n are determined by least square method that k y 0 906 c y 0 08 k n 0 706 c n 0 006 so we can concluded that the hydrodynamic derivatives of the onrt hull specifically x v v y v n v vary greatly for different advancing speed and can be expressed as eqn 6 6 x v v u 1 u 2 7 1 u 0 3 y v u 0 906 u 0 08 n v u 0 706 u 0 006 in order to figure out the effects of advancing speed on the vortex structures fig 11 demonstrates the cross sections of flow field where the local velocity component along x axis u x is smaller than 95 of advancing speed u the results are from cases 29 25 21 14 with four different advancing speed respectively u 0 425 m s 0 709 m s 1 063 m s 1 418 m s and the same lateral velocity v 0 147 m s the same as fig 8 the cross sections are coloured by vorticity magnitude the ship hull is coloured by dynamic pressure p ρ g h and the free surface is coloured by z coordinate value due to the difference on drift angle vortex structures of the four cases varies considerably for lower advancing speed cases u 0 425 m s and u 0 709 m s vortex a b c exist and vortex a is away from the ship hull at the stern region for higher advancing speed cases u 1 063 m s and u 1 418 m s there are two sets of vortex vortex a b and for the case u 1 418 m s vortex a is still near the ship hull at the stern region that will influence the pressure distribution and lead to larger lateral force and yaw moment with the increasing of the advancing speed u the vortex strength increases and the wave elevation grows all these factors are the basic reasons that yield different hydrodynamic forces and moment acting on the ship hull at different advancing speed 6 conclusions in this paper experimental and numerical methods are used to perform oblique towing tests of the onrt hull first the grid convergence and tubulence model study are performed for cases with medium drift angle β 10 and large drift angle β 20 and then based on these results the grid resolution and turbulence model used for other cases are determined for validation purpose the numerical predictions of hydrodynamic forces and moment are compared with experimental measurements for cases with two advancing speed u 0 709 m s and u 1 418 m s and for most cases the numerical results of longitudinal force x lateral force y and moment along z axis n are within the 10 error bands of the experimental measurements thus the cfd solver numerical methods and computing grids are proved accurate enough to simulate this problem by analyzing the detail flow fields around the ship hull at different drift angles we find that when the ship is towing with low drift angle β 2 vortex a is generated by the sonar dome and for the cases with medium drift angle β 4 6 8 vortex b is induced by the skeg when the drift angle β 10 flow separation in the lateral direction happens and vortex c generated by the ship hull becomes the dominant feature that affects the pressure distributions on the ship hull last a numerical study of the advancing speed effects on hydrodynamic derivatives is performed oblique towing tests at four advancing speed u 0 425 m s 0 709 m s 1 063 m s 1 418 m s are considered and three major hydrodynamic derivatives x v v y v n v at different advancing speed are studied we find that the relationship between x v v and u u g l w l is x v v 1 u 2 a u b where a b can be determined via least square method for the onrt model considered in this paper a 7 1 b 0 3 and y v n v have a linear correlation with advancing speed that y v k y u c y n v k n u c n based on the least square method value of these coefficients are determined k y 0 906 c y 0 08 k n 0 706 c n 0 006 where the intercept c y and c n respectively represent the lateral force y and moment along z axis exerted by the ship when it moves laterally without advancing speed to sum up the relationship between non dimensional hydrodynamic derivatives x v v y v n v and advancing speed u are obtained but this relationship needs further application to the mmg model and show how much it influences the standards for ship maneuverability such as tactical diameter advance overshoot angle et al predicted by mmg model on the other hand all the studies performed in this paper are based on the onrt ship hull so further studies are needed to draw general conclusions for arbitrary type of ships
