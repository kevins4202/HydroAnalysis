23305,one possible renewable energy source is microalgal biomass representing sunlight driven cell factories experimental studies have shown that a uniform mixture of microalgae is required for their access to sunlight generally running paddlewheels for raceway ponds and mechanical pumps for photobioreactors are used and their electricity consumption increases the costs of algae mediated biodiesel production to reduce the consumption of electricity we developed the idea of using a floating automatic mix system based on the mixing nature of liquid sloshing in a baffled tank floating in the ocean when oscillatory water waves induce liquid sloshing in the tank vortices form and shedding is generated by horizontal baffles installed in the tank wave motions may be employed to enhance the mixing of microalgae in the tank and dramatically reduce the electricity consumption that is required in traditional algae mediated biodiesel production the vortex generation of sloshing liquids in a tank with horizontal baffles was numerically and experimentally investigated in this study the effects of baffle location and length were systematically studied the study and application of liquid sloshing in a tank with baffles are usually used to tune liquid dampers for vibration control of a structure the particles movement and mixing in the tank are seldom discussed the simulation results found in this study introduce a new application for liquid sloshing in a tank with baffles appropriately allocated horizontal baffles in the tank can significantly enhance the mixing of liquid particles and can be applied in microalgae cultivation 1 introduction because of the gradual reduction in the use of fossil fuels national energy policies in various countries are focused on expanding the use of energy efficiency and accelerating the development of renewable energy industries one possible renewable energy source is microalgal biomass representing sunlight driven cell factories some of the advantages of microalgal biomass are outlined as follows 1 the derived oil yield per unit area may exceed the oilseed crops 2 less water is required compared with ground crops 3 herbicides or pesticides are not required 4 the remainder is used as feed or fertilizer or is fermented and 5 direct biological fixation of carbon dioxide is executed to reduce expenditure biodiesel production must rely on freely provided sunlight despite daily and seasonal changes in light levels experimental studies have shown that a uniform mixture of microalgae is required for their access to sunlight generally running paddlewheels are used for raceway ponds and mechanical pumps are used for photobioreactors and their electricity consumption increases the costs of algae mediated biodiesel production in addition the optimal temperature for algal production is from 20 c to 30 c to maintain a cold temperature the uses of bioreactors in raceway ponds and thermal regulation are always necessary these facilities and the corresponding operations result in further electricity consumption therefore the idea of a floating automatic mixing system was developed because of the mixing nature of liquid sloshing in a baffled tank when floating in the ocean liquid sloshing is produced when the tank is under oscillatory water waves vortices form and shedding are generated by horizontal baffles installed in the tank wave motions may be employed to enhance the mixing of microalgae in the tank and dramatically reduce the electricity consumption that is required in traditional algae mediated biodiesel production sloshing waves in tanks have been studied experimentally analytically and numerically in recent decades a comprehensive review of early analytical and experimental studies of liquid sloshing for application in the aerospace industry was reported by abramson 1966 if the interior of a tank is smooth and no wave breaking occurs an inviscid irrotational potential flow solution in combination with viscous boundary layer flow is suitable for describing sloshing faltinsen and timokha 2009 if the tank excitation is not too small and the excitation frequency is in the vicinity of the lowest natural frequencies free surface nonlinearities play a dominant role other potential flow analyses have been reported by nakayama and washizu 1980 and flipse et al 1980 for a comprehensive review of methods and results of asymptotic sloshing analysis readers are referred to ibrahim 2005 faltinsen and timokha 2002 developed an adaptive multimodal approach to study nonlinear sloshing in a rectangular tank faltinsen et al 2006 extended their asymptotic modal system to model nonlinear sloshing in a three dimensional rectangular tank in addition to potential flow approaches multiple numerical studies of the problem using primitive variables have been made particularly when the fully nonlinear effects of the waves on the free surface are included papers describing the modeling of two dimensional sloshing include chen and chiang 1999 aliabadi et al 2003 chen and nokes 2005 liu and lin 2008 and wu and chen 2009 2012 in this study a numerical baffled tank was established the tank size is small and it can be designed as a series of self buoyant floaters chained together and may ride over the wave the sloshing liquid in a tank under a regular exciting motion takes 400 s to reach the steady state however it is not easy to reach the steady state sloshing when the tank is under irregular exciting motions and the sloshing response in the transient stage is a little bit larger than that in the steady state wen et al 2016 the results reported in the paper are therefore primarily those in the transient stage however we may understand the fundamental phenomena of the vortices generation and mix of the liquid sloshing in the tank with baffles according to the sloshing history in the transient stage the software fluent was used to investigate the effects of horizontal baffles on vortex generation in the tank single and dual baffles were included in the study the effects of baffle positions and lengths were extensively studied experimental studies were also conducted to verify the numerical results section 2 briefly describes the numerical method used in this study and the experimental setup is presented in section 3 section 4 describes the results and discussion and the final section provides the conclusions of this study 2 numerical method the research was conducted using the commercial code of ansys fluent 6 3 which is a computational fluid dynamics cfd code the flow was assumed to be incompressible with constant density and molecular viscosity the navier stokes equation and the continuity equation were solved to acquire the velocity and pressure fields the continuity equation is 1 u x v y 0 and the navier stokes equations of a 3d incompressible flow can be written as 2 u t u u x v u y w u z 1 ρ p x υ 2 u 3 v t u v x v v y w v z g 1 ρ p y υ 2 v 4 w t u w x v w y w w z 1 ρ p z υ 2 w where t is the time and u v and w are the velocity components in the x y and z directions respectively p is the pressure ρ is the fluid density and υ is the kinematic viscous coefficient the free surface was considered to be the air liquid interface and a pressure inlet with standard temperature and pressure was used to model the air sea interface fluent uses the volume of fluid method hirt and nichols 1981 to trace and locate the instant sea air interface and the interface between two liquid layers the volume fraction of each fluid phase was tracked through every cell in brief the following equation was used 5 c q t u c q x v c q y w c q z 0 where c q is a fraction function used to define and calculate the volume ratio of q phase fluid in the computational mesh in the present study q 0 for air 1 for freshwater and 0 5 for water air interfaces a staggered grid was used to define the pressure p at the mesh center whereas the velocity components u v and w were 0 5 δ x 0 5 δ y and 0 5 δ z behind above or backward of the cell center respectively the discretization techniques used to iteratively obtain the flow velocity and pressure field were the quadratic upwind interpolation for convective kinematics method and the pressure implicit with the splitting of operator algorithm to improve the accuracy of the obtained results the second order upwind scheme was used autocad and solidwork codes were used to construct the geometry of the computational domain and to store the results in sat or iges files and then the gambit code was used to establish computational meshes the postprocessing of the output was conducted using matlab to provide the plots and figures for this paper 3 experimental setup fig 1 illustrates a schematic of the tank attached to a shaking table which could be moved back and forth through various trajectories and frequencies by an ac motor the excitation direction of the shaking table was designed to be altered by an aluminum alloy rotational table the maximum moving distance of the shaking table is 30 mm and the highest revolution speed of the motor is 2000 rpm the frequency level depends on the limitation of the maximum velocity implemented by the ac motor and the motor reducer in this experiment the maximum velocity v m ω r of the shaking table was set to approximately 30 mm s indicating that if the excitation displacement r increased the corresponding excitation frequency must be reduced the material of the tank was made from 20 mm thick tempered glass to prevent tank deformation from the impact of hydrostatic and hydrodynamic fluid pressure wave elevation was measured using wave probes the locations of the wave probes p1 and p2 are depicted in fig 1 b 4 results and discussion 4 1 numerical implementation and validation the accuracy of numerical results significantly depends on the mesh resolution and the time step chosen for each problem thus the proper grid size and time step must be verified before large numerical cases to be simulated in the present study the convergence study with both grid size and time step was conducted and are described in this section fig 2 a and b show the convergence and stability study of the wave history at p1 of the tank under oblique excitation by comparing to those of wu et al 2013 it presents a good grid independence phenomenon as the mesh resolution is larger than 126 900 in addition the vorticity generated near the baffle tips is another key factor for testing the stability and convergence of the simulations we also did a convergence test on the strength of vorticity and the results were depicted in fig 2 c d and e the vorticity contour of a cross sectional plane at the center of the tank was depicted in fig 2 c which demonstrates the maximum vorticity is generated near the baffle tips we recorded the maximum vorticity in the simulations and the results with various mesh resolutions and time steps were depicted in fig 2 d and e respectively as indicated by the results of convergence study in the figure the mesh number was 126 900 and the time step was 0 015 s which are appropriate selections additionally to validate the accuracy of the present model the simulated results were compared with the experimental data the size of the regular microalgae farming tank may be referred to an example of the photobioreactors pbrs issued by photon system instruments http www psi cz products which is a flat cultivation tank 120 l or 25 l in volume whose volume is equivalent to a square tank of 50 50 40 cm3 wen et al 2016 reported the effective cultivation of microalgae in a 10 l reactor can produce biomass 12 03 gm 2 day 1 under artificial light radiation and the production might decrease 34 in a 30 l pbr tank under natural solar irradiation that is the tank size of pbr should not be too large because of the necessity of bubble string of the culture to enhance the mixing and to prevent the attachment of cells to the walls of the tank the energy used to pump the air is the majority of energy consumption during the cultivation of microalgae based on wen et al s study the appropriate size of pbr might be in an order of 10 l that is a tank size of 25 25 x 15 or 30 30 10 cm3 tanks and the corresponding fundamental frequency of the sloshing tank is about 8 96 rad s or the eigen period is 0 7 s however the fundamental frequency will be shifted to the left when the tank is attached with baffles wen et al 2016 and the eigen period will be a little bit larger than 0 7 s according to the studies of wen et al 2016 the vorticity generation and liquid mixing in the tank will be larger when the tank is under a near resonant excitation the ideal excited period should be close to the eigen period of the tank the average periods of the wind driven waves are in the ranged from 1 10 s 10 s since the tank size of 30 30 10 cm3 is not a large tank and a small barge may carry many such tanks and it is suitable for the ocean sites with small wind driven wave conditions since we have studied sloshing liquid in tanks for years the experiments conducted were in a 60 60 60 cm cubic tank only for validation purpose the dimensions of the tank used in this study were determined to be 60 60 cm and the still water depth was set to 30 cm fig 1 two horizontal baffles measuring 7 5 cm in length were positioned 22 5 cm above the tank bottom the external force applied horizontally on the tank was a 0 ω x 2 sin ω x t c o s θ where a 0 0 0015 m to get a near resonant sloshing phenomenon to validate the numerically simulated results we therefore used 1 1 ω1 as the exciting frequency that is ω x 8 rad s 1 the corresponding mesh distribution was depicted in fig 3 c and d which is the case of mesh resolution 126 900 presented in the grid independence test it is noted that the mesh refinement is used near the interface of air and water as well as the baffle tips to capture the free surface elevation and vortices generated due to the effect of baffle tips the water elevations were measured at p1 and p2 fig 1 fig 3 depicts the comparison of the numerical results with the experimental measurements the agreement was good and the present numerical model can reasonably predict variations in water elevation in a tank with baffles 4 2 evolution of vorticity in a tank with and without baffles vorticity development in a tank without baffles and those in a tank with baffles are discussed in this section chen and nokes 2005 reported the evolution of velocity vectors of sloshing fluids in a tank without baffles during surge motion as shown in fig 13 of their paper the vorticity generation is hardly developed in a tank without baffles fig 4 depicts the streamline patterns of sloshing liquids in a tank with single baffle under different excitation frequencies as shown in the figure the vortices are easily developed and many vortices were generated not only near the baffle tip but also near the tank bottom wu et al 2016 comprehensively discussed the dynamics of vortex evolution in a 2d tank they found that the vortex size is closely correlated with the baffle height when the baffle height is small db 0 2d0 the vortex size mainly grows in the horizontal direction instead the vortex size dominantly develops in the vertical direction as db 0 3d0 the period of the generation and shedding of vortices near the baffle tip is nearly about one half of the excitation period of the tank the dynamics of vortex evolution is closely related to the growth and the hydrodynamic interaction of the vortices and sensitively depends on the baffle height liquid depth excitation frequency and excitation displacement of the tank 4 3 the streamline patterns in transient and steady states single vertical baffle when the tank is excited by irregular motions the sloshing liquid flow is constantly changing and no steady state is reached besides the vorticity development of the sloshing liquid in the steady state might be different from that in the transient state fig 5 compares the vorticity and streamline patterns of the sloshing liquid in transient and steady states for d0 l 0 5 the ratio of baffle height db to liquid depth is 0 5 and the streamline patterns of steady state and transient state are about the same but the strength of the vorticities of the transient state seems a little bit larger than those of the steady state fig 6 further presents the streamline patterns of the same ratio of baffle height to liquid depth 0 5 but a different liquid depth d0 l is equal to 0 1 which is the tank of the proposed cultivation tank suitable for small wind driven wave conditions the streamline patterns are different in steady and transient states but the mixing is very good in both states besides as shown in fig 6 the repeated streamline patterns during both transient and steady states occurred in every 2 s and we may assume the time for mixing is around two seconds which is about 2 times of the resonance period 4 4 single horizontal baffle the effects of the baffle partition height h b and width w b on the natural frequency and wave height were investigated a single horizontal baffle was fixed in the tank fig 7 the dimensionless parameters of baffle width and baffle location are defined as w b x b d 0 and h b y b d 0 respectively the tank acceleration applied horizontally was equal to a 0 ω x 2 sin ω x t where a 0 1 5 mm ω x 1 1 ω 1 and ω 1 is the natural frequency of the tank without baffles the baffle location was h b 0 25 0 75 and the baffle width was w b 0 25 0 80 fig 8 shows the effects of these two parameters on the natural frequency ω 1 and the maximum wave height h the estimated natural frequency of the baffled tank was obtained through power spectral density analysis we analyzed the data of the simulation when it almost reached the steady state condition and the time for the steady state is varied for each case for the wave height we got the maximum wave elevation h of each case during the first beating period of our simulations as shown the natural frequency of the tank was ω b 1 ω 1 0 95 0 96 implying that the new resonant frequency of the tank was only slightly affected when baffle elevation moved closer to the tank bottom h b 0 375 where ω b 1 is the new resonant frequency of the tank with a horizontal baffle the detailed discussion on the change of the actual tank resonance period with the position of the vertical baffle s was carried out in the study of wu et al 2012 and we have a similar finding for the horizontal baffle used in our present works fig 9 depicts the water surface elevation at p1 of the tank with a single horizontal baffle at various locations with a fixed baffle width 0 4 the beating phenomenon of sloshing could be found when the position of the horizontal baffle was close to the tank bottom which indicated that its new natural frequency ω b 1 was close to the first natural frequency ω 1 as well as the external excitation frequency the half period of the beating phenomenon can be obtained by ω b 1 ω b 1 ω 1 as illustrated in the figure the half period of the beating phenomenon decreased as ω b 1 moved away from ω 1 for the simulation results derived from using ω x 1 1 ω 1 w b 0 25 and h b 0 75 the velocity and acceleration of the tank motion are shown in fig 10 and the corresponding evolution of velocity vectors of the liquid in the tank is shown in fig 11 the horizontal axis of fig 11 represents the coordinate of the tank bottom and 0 3 and 0 3 represent the left and right ends of the tank bottom respectively at t 47 96 s the free surface sloshed to the highest elevation at the right wall and the liquid particles at and beneath the free surface were almost stationary subsequently the free surface gradually sloshed to the left because of the effects of gravity and the negative acceleration acting on the tank during the period t 47 96 48 16 s the flow field began to reverse its traveling direction as the excitation acceleration changed from negative to positive when t 48 16 s the free surface at the left wall began to rise as illustrated in fig 11 dual vortices rotating in opposite directions were constantly developed during the whole excitation cycle these counter rotating vortices might be able to increase the liquid exchange and mixing between the surface and the bottom meaning that vortex generation might improve mixing efficiency to easily describe the phenomenon we defined two regions in the baffled tank as illustrated in fig 12 a the triangular symbols presented in fig 12 b represent the initial positions of each marked fluid particle near the bottom the trajectories of the marked liquid particles are shown in figs 13 15 for the baffle lengths w b 0 25 0 5 and 0 8 respectively each figure also illustrates the results of the trajectories of the marked liquid particles with various baffle locations as revealed in the figures when the baffle length was equal to 0 8 do the liquid particle exchange occurred only in the right part of the tank the liquid particles beneath the baffle were limited to region a and were completely blocked by the baffle the lowest particle exchange occurred when the baffle was farthest from the tank bottom when the baffle length was reduced to 0 5 do the liquid particle exchange improved relative to the previous case however the liquid particles beneath the baffle were still limited to region a and blocked by the baffle which was close to the tank bottom h b 0 25 when the baffle length was further reduced to 0 25 do the liquid particles exchange became much more improved relative to the previous two cases and the liquid particles beneath the baffle could travel freely outside region a when the baffle location h b was larger than 0 5 in summary the baffle length and location affected the liquid particle exchange in the tank and the ratio of the baffle location to the baffle width h b w b might be a reference parameter to determine the performance of liquid particle exchange or mixing when h b w b 0 5 the liquid particles movement remained mostly inside region a whereas when h b w b 0 5 1 particles could leave region a because of the vortex effect when h b w b 1 dual and counter rotating vortices occurred thus resulting in effective liquid particle exchange furthermore when w b 0 5 d 0 the liquid particles beneath the baffle experienced difficulty in traveling to the free surface and the baffle blocked the upward movement of the liquid particles moreover if the horizontal baffle was too close to the tank bottom the motion of the liquid particles beneath the baffle was limited to below the baffle figs 16 18 illustrate the streamline patterns of the liquid sloshing in the tank with a single baffle at various locations the results shown in the figures further confirm that the movement of liquid particles is strictly controlled by the baffle width and location 4 5 single directional and swirling waves in a real ocean environment the floating tank would experience six degree of freedom motions surge sway heave pitch yaw and roll in this study we focused on horizontal excitation by an oblique excitation direction relative to the tank wall for demonstration purposes only two different excitation angles were selected which were θ 0 and 22 5 as reported by wu et al 2010 six possible sloshing waves can occur in a tank depending on the excitation frequency when the excitation frequency approaches the fundamental frequency of the liquid in the tank a swirling wave develops and the sloshing wave alternates in clockwise and counter clockwise rotations in the tank fig 19 depicts the displacement histories of the surface elevation at four different corners of the tank the trace of the free surface peak the relationship between p1 and p2 in terms of elevation and the free surface elevation contour in this case the excitation angle was 0 representing a surge direction the sloshing wave was determined to be a single directional wave even when the excitation frequency was exactly equal to the fundamental frequency of the liquid in the tank without a baffle in the next case the excitation angle was increased to 22 5 and the corresponding results are illustrated in fig 20 the relationship between p1 and p2 in terms of elevation is shown in fig 20 c clearly demonstrating that swirling waves occurred in the tank wu et al 2010 through the aid of the swirling waves developing in the tank we might expect the mixing phenomenon to be greatly enhanced if the floating tank is set as oblique to the incoming ocean waves 4 6 dual horizontal baffles as mentioned the baffle length affects liquid particle exchange therefore a baffle length of w b 0 25 was used in this test dual horizontal baffles were fixed symmetrically in the tank fig 21 the same external force used in the previous section was applied horizontally on the tank various baffle locations h b 0 25 0 75 were considered the effects of these two parameters on the natural frequency ω 1 and wave height h were investigated fig 22 depicts the water elevations measured at two positions p1 and p2 also shown are the fft analyses of the sloshing displacements two response peaks were found one peak was attributed to the external excitation frequency and the other peak was attributed to the new fundamental frequency of the tank with dual baffles thus the new natural frequencies were 6 82 6 68 and 6 44 rad s at various baffle locations and the resonant frequency decreased as the baffle location h b increased in the case of the tank with a single baffle the baffle s location played a key role in liquid mixing in the tank fig 23 shows the trajectories of the liquid particles at lower levels of the tank with various dual baffle locations the liquid particles at the lower level of the tank were drawn upward by the vortex developed in the tank however the upper limit of traveling location of those particles was positively related to the height of the baffle s location in the tank in other words the particles were raised to the free surface but the final position of the particles was closely related to the baffle s position and the baffle being close to the tank bottom limited the particle motion only in the region near the bottom fig 24 presents the velocity vectors of liquid sloshing in the tank with dual baffles with w b 0 25 and h b 0 75 at t 18 56 s the free surface sloshed to the highest level on the left side and small vortices were generated at the tips of the baffles whereas much larger dual counter rotating vortices were generated than those that developed in the tank with a single baffle the liquid particles in the left and right parts of the tank did not enter opposite sides because of these dual counter rotating vortices and the particle trajectory shown in fig 23 also confirms this phenomenon the circulation efficiency or capability of a tank with baffles can be described by counting the ratio of particles originally at lower levels that can travel to the upper level accordingly we traced nearly 200 particles near the tank bottom and fig 25 shows the percentages of the particles at various levels of the tank the dash dot line green dashed line blue and solid line red represent the particles reachable levels in the tank regardless of the baffle location more than 60 of the particles at lower levels reached level 0 25 when hb 0 25 only 20 of the particles reached level 0 5 and none of the particles reached level 0 75 by contrast more than 40 of the particles reached level 0 75 when hb 0 75 again the baffle s location played a key role in determining the strength of liquid mixing in the tank 4 7 comparison of tank with different baffle positions we also compared the mixing efficiencies of liquids in tanks with four different baffle positions fig 26 no baffle dual symmetrically located baffles wb 0 25 hb 0 75 dual asymmetrically located baffles wb1 0 25 hb1 0 75 and wb1 0 25 hb1 0 50 and four vertical evenly spaced baffles fig 27 illustrates the evolution of the velocity vectors and the corresponding vortex contours of the four cases the particle trajectories of the liquid in the tanks are illustrated in fig 28 and the circulation capability of the liquid particles in the tanks are shown in fig 29 the mixing efficiency was poorest in the tank with no baffles the liquid particles at the lower level had nearly no chance to leave their original location the tank with asymmetrically located baffles exhibited greater mixing efficiency and circulation capability than the tank with vertical baffles by comparing this with the circulation capabilities illustrated in fig 29 b and c we can propose that the most efficient circulation occurred in the tank with symmetrically located baffles 5 conclusions numerical studies and experimental measurements of liquid sloshing in a tank with horizontal and vertical baffles were demonstrated and discussed both the convergence study of the present numerical model and the benchmark tests showed that the cfd simulation results had good accuracy the comparison between the experimental measurements and the numerical results validated the consistency of the present numerical simulation comprehensive investigations including the evolution of vortices the trace of the particles due to baffles and the effects of baffle length and location on liquid mixing and resonant frequencies were conducted the following key conclusions were made 1 because of the presence of baffles vortices were generated near the baffles tips these vortices increased the fluid exchange between the surface and the bottom this means that vortex generation might improve the mixing efficiency of liquid particles in a tank 2 wide baffles blocked the upward movement of fluid particles moreover the baffle location played a key role in the movement of lower particles when the horizontal baffle was closer to the bottom the particle motion was limited to below the baffle 3 in the tank with dual horizontal baffles located symmetrically vortices that developed near the baffle tips enhanced particle movement and the particles at lower levels of the tank were drawn upward due to the counter rotating vortices the particles in the left and right parts of the tank did not interact because of the counter rotating vortices controlling the trajectories of the liquid particles 4 the results regarding particle trajectories reveal that the final position of the particles was closely related to the baffle s position baffles close to the tank bottom limited particle motion to the region near the bottom 5 the mixing phenomena of liquids in four different tanks with different positions of baffles were also studied the tank with dual baffles at symmetrical locations had the maximum particle circulation and mixing efficiency whereas the tank without baffles had the poorest 6 based on the study of wen et al 2016 the appropriate size of pbr might be in a range of 10 l that is a tank size of 25 25 x 15 or 30 30 x 10 tanks which is not a large tank and a small barge may carry many such tanks those tanks are suitable for the ocean environment with small wind driven wave conditions and the inner bay and lagoon are the most suitable places for the proposed floating cultivation tanks acknowledgements we would like to thank the reviewer for his her thoughtful and

was used to model the air sea interface fluent uses the volume of fluid method hirt and nichols 1981 to trace and locate the instant sea air interface and the interface between two liquid layers the volume fraction of each fluid phase was tracked through every cell in brief the following equation was used 5 c q t u c q x v c q y w c q z 0 where c q is a fraction function used to define and calculate the volume ratio of q phase fluid in the computational mesh in the present study q 0 for air 1 for freshwater and 0 5 for water air interfaces a staggered grid was used to define the pressure p at the mesh center whereas the velocity components u v and w were 0 5 δ x 0 5 δ y and 0 5 δ z behind above or backward of the cell center respectively the discretization techniques used to iteratively obtain the flow velocity and pressure field were the quadratic upwind interpolation for convective kinematics method and the pressure implicit with the splitting of operator algorithm to improve the accuracy of the obtained results the second order upwind scheme was used autocad and solidwork codes were used to construct the geometry of the computational domain and to store the results in sat or iges files and then the gambit code was used to establish computational meshes the postprocessing of the output was conducted using matlab to provide the plots and figures for this paper 3 experimental setup fig 1 illustrates a schematic of the tank attached to a shaking table which could be moved back and forth through various trajectories and frequencies by an ac motor the excitation direction of the shaking table was designed to be altered by an aluminum alloy rotational table the maximum moving distance of the shaking table is 30 mm and the highest revolution speed of the motor is 2000 rpm the frequency level depends on the limitation of the maximum velocity implemented by the ac motor and the motor reducer in this experiment the maximum velocity v m ω r of the shaking table was set to approximately 30 mm s indicating that if the excitation displacement r increased the corresponding excitation frequency must be reduced the material of the tank was made from 20 mm thick tempered glass to prevent tank deformation from the impact of hydrostatic and hydrodynamic fluid pressure wave elevation was measured using wave probes the locations of the wave probes p1 and p2 are depicted in fig 1 b 4 results and discussion 4 1 numerical implementation and validation the accuracy of numerical results significantly depends on the mesh resolution and the time step chosen for each problem thus the proper grid size and time step must be verified before large numerical cases to be simulated in the present study the convergence study with both grid size and time step was conducted and are described in this section fig 2 a and b show the convergence and stability study of the wave history at p1 of the tank under oblique excitation by comparing to those of wu et al 2013 it presents a good grid independence phenomenon as the mesh resolution is larger than 126 900 in addition the vorticity generated near the baffle tips is another key factor for testing the stability and convergence of the simulations we also did a convergence test on the strength of vorticity and the results were depicted in fig 2 c d and e the vorticity contour of a cross sectional plane at the center of the tank was depicted in fig 2 c which demonstrates the maximum vorticity is generated near the baffle tips we recorded the maximum vorticity in the simulations and the results with various mesh resolutions and time steps were depicted in fig 2 d and e respectively as indicated by the results of convergence study in the figure the mesh number was 126 900 and the time step was 0 015 s which are appropriate selections additionally to validate the accuracy of the present model the simulated results were compared with the experimental data the size of the regular microalgae farming tank may be referred to an example of the photobioreactors pbrs issued by photon system instruments http www psi cz products which is a flat cultivation tank 120 l or 25 l in volume whose volume is equivalent to a square tank of 50 50 40 cm3 wen et al 2016 reported the effective cultivation of microalgae in a 10 l reactor can produce biomass 12 03 gm 2 day 1 under artificial light radiation and the production might decrease 34 in a 30 l pbr tank under natural solar irradiation that is the tank size of pbr should not be too large because of the necessity of bubble string of the culture to enhance the mixing and to prevent the attachment of cells to the walls of the tank the energy used to pump the air is the majority of energy consumption during the cultivation of microalgae based on wen et al s study the appropriate size of pbr might be in an order of 10 l that is a tank size of 25 25 x 15 or 30 30 10 cm3 tanks and the corresponding fundamental frequency of the sloshing tank is about 8 96 rad s or the eigen period is 0 7 s however the fundamental frequency will be shifted to the left when the tank is attached with baffles wen et al 2016 and the eigen period will be a little bit larger than 0 7 s according to the studies of wen et al 2016 the vorticity generation and liquid mixing in the tank will be larger when the tank is under a near resonant excitation the ideal excited period should be close to the eigen period of the tank the average periods of the wind driven waves are in the ranged from 1 10 s 10 s since the tank size of 30 30 10 cm3 is not a large tank and a small barge may carry many such tanks and it is suitable for the ocean sites with small wind driven wave conditions since we have studied sloshing liquid in tanks for years the experiments conducted were in a 60 60 60 cm cubic tank only for validation purpose the dimensions of the tank used in this study were determined to be 60 60 cm and the still water depth was set to 30 cm fig 1 two horizontal baffles measuring 7 5 cm in length were positioned 22 5 cm above the tank bottom the external force applied horizontally on the tank was a 0 ω x 2 sin ω x t c o s θ where a 0 0 0015 m to get a near resonant sloshing phenomenon to validate the numerically simulated results we therefore used 1 1 ω1 as the exciting frequency that is ω x 8 rad s 1 the corresponding mesh distribution was depicted in fig 3 c and d which is the case of mesh resolution 126 900 presented in the grid independence test it is noted that the mesh refinement is used near the interface of air and water as well as the baffle tips to capture the free surface elevation and vortices generated due to the effect of baffle tips the water elevations were measured at p1 and p2 fig 1 fig 3 depicts the comparison of the numerical results with the experimental measurements the agreement was good and the present numerical model can reasonably predict variations in water elevation in a tank with baffles 4 2 evolution of vorticity in a tank with and without baffles vorticity development in a tank without baffles and those in a tank with baffles are discussed in this section chen and nokes 2005 reported the evolution of velocity vectors of sloshing fluids in a tank without baffles during surge motion as shown in fig 13 of their paper the vorticity generation is hardly developed in a tank without baffles fig 4 depicts the streamline patterns of sloshing liquids in a tank with single baffle under different excitation frequencies as shown in the figure the vortices are easily developed and many vortices were generated not only near the baffle tip but also near the tank bottom wu et al 2016 comprehensively discussed the dynamics of vortex evolution in a 2d tank they found that the vortex size is closely correlated with the baffle height when the baffle height is small db 0 2d0 the vortex size mainly grows in the horizontal direction instead the vortex size dominantly develops in the vertical direction as db 0 3d0 the period of the generation and shedding of vortices near the baffle tip is nearly about one half of the excitation period of the tank the dynamics of vortex evolution is closely related to the growth and the hydrodynamic interaction of the vortices and sensitively depends on the baffle height liquid depth excitation frequency and excitation displacement of the tank 4 3 the streamline patterns in transient and steady states single vertical baffle when the tank is excited by irregular motions the sloshing liquid flow is constantly changing and no steady state is reached besides the vorticity development of the sloshing liquid in the steady state might be different from that in the transient state fig 5 compares the vorticity and streamline patterns of the sloshing liquid in transient and steady states for d0 l 0 5 the ratio of baffle height db to liquid depth is 0 5 and the streamline patterns of steady state and transient state are about the same but the strength of the vorticities of the transient state seems a little bit larger than those of the steady state fig 6 further presents the streamline patterns of the same ratio of baffle height to liquid depth 0 5 but a different liquid depth d0 l is equal to 0 1 which is the tank of the proposed cultivation tank suitable for small wind driven wave conditions the streamline patterns are different in steady and transient states but the mixing is very good in both states besides as shown in fig 6 the repeated streamline patterns during both transient and steady states occurred in every 2 s and we may assume the time for mixing is around two seconds which is about 2 times of the resonance period 4 4 single horizontal baffle the effects of the baffle partition height h b and width w b on the natural frequency and wave height were investigated a single horizontal baffle was fixed in the tank fig 7 the dimensionless parameters of baffle width and baffle location are defined as w b x b d 0 and h b y b d 0 respectively the tank acceleration applied horizontally was equal to a 0 ω x 2 sin ω x t where a 0 1 5 mm ω x 1 1 ω 1 and ω 1 is the natural frequency of the tank without baffles the baffle location was h b 0 25 0 75 and the baffle width was w b 0 25 0 80 fig 8 shows the effects of these two parameters on the natural frequency ω 1 and the maximum wave height h the estimated natural frequency of the baffled tank was obtained through power spectral density analysis we analyzed the data of the simulation when it almost reached the steady state condition and the time for the steady state is varied for each case for the wave height we got the maximum wave elevation h of each case during the first beating period of our simulations as shown the natural frequency of the tank was ω b 1 ω 1 0 95 0 96 implying that the new resonant frequency of the tank was only slightly affected when baffle elevation moved closer to the tank bottom h b 0 375 where ω b 1 is the new resonant frequency of the tank with a horizontal baffle the detailed discussion on the change of the actual tank resonance period with the position of the vertical baffle s was carried out in the study of wu et al 2012 and we have a similar finding for the horizontal baffle used in our present works fig 9 depicts the water surface elevation at p1 of the tank with a single horizontal baffle at various locations with a fixed baffle width 0 4 the beating phenomenon of sloshing could be found when the position of the horizontal baffle was close to the tank bottom which indicated that its new natural frequency ω b 1 was close to the first natural frequency ω 1 as well as the external excitation frequency the half period of the beating phenomenon can be obtained by ω b 1 ω b 1 ω 1 as illustrated in the figure the half period of the beating phenomenon decreased as ω b 1 moved away from ω 1 for the simulation results derived from using ω x 1 1 ω 1 w b 0 25 and h b 0 75 the velocity and acceleration of the tank motion are shown in fig 10 and the corresponding evolution of velocity vectors of the liquid in the tank is shown in fig 11 the horizontal axis of fig 11 represents the coordinate of the tank bottom and 0 3 and 0 3 represent the left and right ends of the tank bottom respectively at t 47 96 s the free surface sloshed to the highest elevation at the right wall and the liquid particles at and beneath the free surface were almost stationary subsequently the free surface gradually sloshed to the left because of the effects of gravity and the negative acceleration acting on the tank during the period t 47 96 48 16 s the flow field began to reverse its traveling direction as the excitation acceleration changed from negative to positive when t 48 16 s the free surface at the left wall began to rise as illustrated in fig 11 dual vortices rotating in opposite directions were constantly developed during the whole excitation cycle these counter rotating vortices might be able to increase the liquid exchange and mixing between the surface and the bottom meaning that vortex generation might improve mixing efficiency to easily describe the phenomenon we defined two regions in the baffled tank as illustrated in fig 12 a the triangular symbols presented in fig 12 b represent the initial positions of each marked fluid particle near the bottom the trajectories of the marked liquid particles are shown in figs 13 15 for the baffle lengths w b 0 25 0 5 and 0 8 respectively each figure also illustrates the results of the trajectories of the marked liquid particles with various baffle locations as revealed in the figures when the baffle length was equal to 0 8 do the liquid particle exchange occurred only in the right part of the tank the liquid particles beneath the baffle were limited to region a and were completely blocked by the baffle the lowest particle exchange occurred when the baffle was farthest from the tank bottom when the baffle length was reduced to 0 5 do the liquid particle exchange improved relative to the previous case however the liquid particles beneath the baffle were still limited to region a and blocked by the baffle which was close to the tank bottom h b 0 25 when the baffle length was further reduced to 0 25 do the liquid particles exchange became much more improved relative to the previous two cases and the liquid particles beneath the baffle could travel freely outside region a when the baffle location h b was larger than 0 5 in summary the baffle length and location affected the liquid particle exchange in the tank and the ratio of the baffle location to the baffle width h b w b might be a reference parameter to determine the performance of liquid particle exchange or mixing when h b w b 0 5 the liquid particles movement remained mostly inside region a whereas when h b w b 0 5 1 particles could leave region a because of the vortex effect when h b w b 1 dual and counter rotating vortices occurred thus resulting in effective liquid particle exchange furthermore when w b 0 5 d 0 the liquid particles beneath the baffle experienced difficulty in traveling to the free surface and the baffle blocked the upward movement of the liquid particles moreover if the horizontal baffle was too close to the tank bottom the motion of the liquid particles beneath the baffle was limited to below the baffle figs 16 18 illustrate the streamline patterns of the liquid sloshing in the tank with a single baffle at various locations the results shown in the figures further confirm that the movement of liquid particles is strictly controlled by the baffle width and location 4 5 single directional and swirling waves in a real ocean environment the floating tank would experience six degree of freedom motions surge sway heave pitch yaw and roll in this study we focused on horizontal excitation by an oblique excitation direction relative to the tank wall for demonstration purposes only two different excitation angles were selected which were θ 0 and 22 5 as reported by wu et al 2010 six possible sloshing waves can occur in a tank depending on the excitation frequency when the excitation frequency approaches the fundamental frequency of the liquid in the tank a swirling wave develops and the sloshing wave alternates in clockwise and counter clockwise rotations in the tank fig 19 depicts the displacement histories of the surface elevation at four different corners of the tank the trace of the free surface peak the relationship between p1 and p2 in terms of elevation and the free surface elevation contour in this case the excitation angle was 0 representing a surge direction the sloshing wave was determined to be a single directional wave even when the excitation frequency was exactly equal to the fundamental frequency of the liquid in the tank without a baffle in the next case the excitation angle was increased to 22 5 and the corresponding results are illustrated in fig 20 the relationship between p1 and p2 in terms of elevation is shown in fig 20 c clearly demonstrating that swirling waves occurred in the tank wu et al 2010 through the aid of the swirling waves developing in the tank we might expect the mixing phenomenon to be greatly enhanced if the floating tank is set as oblique to the incoming ocean waves 4 6 dual horizontal baffles as mentioned the baffle length affects liquid particle exchange therefore a baffle length of w b 0 25 was used in this test dual horizontal baffles were fixed symmetrically in the tank fig 21 the same external force used in the previous section was applied horizontally on the tank various baffle locations h b 0 25 0 75 were considered the effects of these two parameters on the natural frequency ω 1 and wave height h were investigated fig 22 depicts the water elevations measured at two positions p1 and p2 also shown are the fft analyses of the sloshing displacements two response peaks were found one peak was attributed to the external excitation frequency and the other peak was attributed to the new fundamental frequency of the tank with dual baffles thus the new natural frequencies were 6 82 6 68 and 6 44 rad s at various baffle locations and the resonant frequency decreased as the baffle location h b increased in the case of the tank with a single baffle the baffle s location played a key role in liquid mixing in the tank fig 23 shows the trajectories of the liquid particles at lower levels of the tank with various dual baffle locations the liquid particles at the lower level of the tank were drawn upward by the vortex developed in the tank however the upper limit of traveling location of those particles was positively related to the height of the baffle s location in the tank in other words the particles were raised to the free surface but the final position of the particles was closely related to the baffle s position and the baffle being close to the tank bottom limited the particle motion only in the region near the bottom fig 24 presents the velocity vectors of liquid sloshing in the tank with dual baffles with w b 0 25 and h b 0 75 at t 18 56 s the free surface sloshed to the highest level on the left side and small vortices were generated at the tips of the baffles whereas much larger dual counter rotating vortices were generated than those that developed in the tank with a single baffle the liquid particles in the left and right parts of the tank did not enter opposite sides because of these dual counter rotating vortices and the particle trajectory shown in fig 23 also confirms this phenomenon the circulation efficiency or capability of a tank with baffles can be described by counting the ratio of particles originally at lower levels that can travel to the upper level accordingly we traced nearly 200 particles near the tank bottom and fig 25 shows the percentages of the particles at various levels of the tank the dash dot line green dashed line blue and solid line red represent the particles reachable levels in the tank regardless of the baffle location more than 60 of the particles at lower levels reached level 0 25 when hb 0 25 only 20 of the particles reached level 0 5 and none of the particles reached level 0 75 by contrast more than 40 of the particles reached level 0 75 when hb 0 75 again the baffle s location played a key role in determining the strength of liquid mixing in the tank 4 7 comparison of tank with different baffle positions we also compared the mixing efficiencies of liquids in tanks with four different baffle positions fig 26 no baffle dual symmetrically located baffles wb 0 25 hb 0 75 dual asymmetrically located baffles wb1 0 25 hb1 0 75 and wb1 0 25 hb1 0 50 and four vertical evenly spaced baffles fig 27 illustrates the evolution of the velocity vectors and the corresponding vortex contours of the four cases the particle trajectories of the liquid in the tanks are illustrated in fig 28 and the circulation capability of the liquid particles in the tanks are shown in fig 29 the mixing efficiency was poorest in the tank with no baffles the liquid particles at the lower level had nearly no chance to leave their original location the tank with asymmetrically located baffles exhibited greater mixing efficiency and circulation capability than the tank with vertical baffles by comparing this with the circulation capabilities illustrated in fig 29 b and c we can propose that the most efficient circulation occurred in the tank with symmetrically located baffles 5 conclusions numerical studies and experimental measurements of liquid sloshing in a tank with horizontal and vertical baffles were demonstrated and discussed both the convergence study of the present numerical model and the benchmark tests showed that the cfd simulation results had good accuracy the comparison between the experimental measurements and the numerical results validated the consistency of the present numerical simulation comprehensive investigations including the evolution of vortices the trace of the particles due to baffles and the effects of baffle length and location on liquid mixing and resonant frequencies were conducted the following key conclusions were made 1 because of the presence of baffles vortices were generated near the baffles tips these vortices increased the fluid exchange between the surface and the bottom this means that vortex generation might improve the mixing efficiency of liquid particles in a tank 2 wide baffles blocked the upward movement of fluid particles moreover the baffle location played a key role in the movement of lower particles when the horizontal baffle was closer to the bottom the particle motion was limited to below the baffle 3 in the tank with dual horizontal baffles located symmetrically vortices that developed near the baffle tips enhanced particle movement and the particles at lower levels of the tank were drawn upward due to the counter rotating vortices the particles in the left and right parts of the tank did not interact because of the counter rotating vortices controlling the trajectories of the liquid particles 4 the results regarding particle trajectories reveal that the final position of the particles was closely related to the baffle s position baffles close to the tank bottom limited particle motion to the region near the bottom 5 the mixing phenomena of liquids in four different tanks with different positions of baffles were also studied the tank with dual baffles at symmetrical locations had the maximum particle circulation and mixing efficiency whereas the tank without baffles had the poorest 6 based on the study of wen et al 2016 the appropriate size of pbr might be in a range of 10 l that is a tank size of 25 25 x 15 or 30 30 x 10 tanks which is not a large tank and a small barge may carry many such tanks those tanks are suitable for the ocean environment with small wind driven wave conditions and the inner bay and lagoon are the most suitable places for the proposed floating cultivation tanks acknowledgements we would like to thank the reviewer for his her thoughtful and

23306,this paper introduces the status of the chinese and international shipbreaking industry and discusses the hazardous shipbreaking materials and the effects on environment and human therefore this paper explores green shipbreaking technology and puts forward the application of the abrasive water jet cutting technology to the shipbreaking process and studies the feasibility of the application from the aspects of its implementation environmental protection safety efficiency and economy moreover this paper also discusses the deficiencies of this idea keywords shipbreaking hazardous materials abrasive water jet cutting green technology 1 the shipbreaking industry overview the global economic growth has promoted the global maritime trade thus greatly promoting the development of the shipbuilding industry in general the life of a ship is usually 20 30 years the ships built at the end of the last century have ended or will end their services and the dismantling of these ships has become a worthy consideration in recent years the recovery of the global economic is slow the situation of excess transportation capacity continues and energy efficiency design index eedi has officially entered into force imo 2011 these factors have led to an obvious trend that ships are sent for recycling at an earlier age for many ship owners it is more economical to declare a ship unfit for service instead of opting to service or modify the ship under the influence of the global financial crisis the continuous depression of shipping business has resulted in a sharp increase of ships to dismantled mao 2009 therefore the shipbreaking industry has a large market around the world see fig 1 6 although the shipbreaking process may cause a range of harmful consequences including air pollution water pollution soil pollution and explosion etc it is beneficial for the world s environment and resource conservation shipbreaking industry as a green industry has become a part of the circular economy since dismantling and processing old vessels rahman et al 2016 on the one hand it provides the shipowner with the disposal service of the old vessels on the other hand shipbreaking allows the materials from the ship especially steel to be recycled and made into new products this lowers the demand for mined iron ore and reduces energy use in the steelmaking process so it is extremely important to optimize and improve shipbreaking technology and effectively reduce pollution this article introduces the status of the chinese and international shipbreaking industry from the respects of shipbreaking methods social environment economic cost environmental protection measures and so on it analyses and studies the hazardous materials during shipbreaking process such as asbestos pcbs solid foam fiberglass etc and their negative impacts on environment and human for conventional hot cutting technology this article puts forward the application of a greener technology abrasive water jet cutting method in the shipbreaking process and studies the feasibility of the application from the aspects of implementation environmental protection safety efficiency and economy 2 the present status of shipbreaking industry the shipbreaking yards mainly located in bangladesh india china and pakistan the annual shipbreaking tonnage of these four asian countries accounts for 85 percent of the global total ocn 2017 and other shipbreaking shipyards located in the mediterranean area and turkey more than 700 ships are sent for recycling every year galley 2014 and in 2009 the shipbreaking market hit a 13 year high sarraf et al 2010 according to clarkson s institute clarkson 2017 the latest statistics on the trend of shipbreaking shows that in 2016 933 ships a total tonnage of 44 4 million dwt were dismantled in total an increase of 14 over the same period last year in 2016 the shipbreaking activities of bulk cargo ship and container ship played an important role 65 and 18 of the total tonnage respectively the shipbreaking tonnage of the four asian countries bangladesh china india and pakistan accounts for 90 percent of the global total in 2016 by this token the development momentum of the shipbreaking industry is still strong at this stage and the recovery of shipping industry still has a long way to go the shipbreaking yards in south asia often use beaching method to dismantle ships taking the ship onto beach and then dismantling the ship there in which case the process and related equipment are simple so the cost of site and fixed equipment is low moreover the labor of shipbreaking markets is abundant cheap and skilled the direct and indirect utilization of dismantled goods is high and the developed secondary market can offer a recycling way for dismantled goods cnsa 2017 but it is clear that during the shipbreaking process environmental pollution and workers safety problems are worrisome in these areas the shipbreaking yards in china mainly use the dock or wharf method to dismantle ships which can effectively reduce the pollution caused by hazardous materials in such way china has won more shipbreaking orders that requiring environment protection and due to the advanced technology chinese shipbreaking yards tend to dismantle large tankers and very large crude carriers involving complicated technical difficulty and huge profits xu 2009 in china the yangtze river delta and the pearl river delta play the leading role in the shipbreaking industry and some coastal areas develop side by side zhu 2009 since 2009 china always occupies the top 3 of the amount on shipbreaking in the world wang 2016 which provides vast regenerated metal resources for circular economy the shipbreaking capacity of china has been widely recognized around the world china has greatly promoted the safe and green shipbreaking industry and improved energy saving and emission reduction which has made active contribution and obtained the good social efficiency in china the scrap steel price at home and abroad has hung upside down for a long time and the scrap steel market demand is not prosperous the tight export restriction on scrap steel and the wharf or dock shipbreaking method increase the environmental protection and safety inputs above factors resulted in that the shipbreaking price gap between china and the south asian countries has become larger and larger during twelfth five year in bangladesh india and pakistan every light ton of scrapped ship price generally is 150 200 dollars higher than chinese enterprises cnsa 2017 the huge difference made chinese enterprises lose the competitive advantage on buying the ships to be dismantled so that the number of imported ship to drop significantly in recent years yet although economic efficiency is not good china s shipbreaking industry insists on promoting the green shipbreaking research promotion and management work and continues to invest in shipbreaking safety and environmental protection facilities previously in china imported scrap steel and raw ore were tariff free but imported ships needed to pay the 3 tariff and the scrapped ships as the recycling resources have few subsidies or tax breaks recently china has adjusted the tax policy involving shipbreaking and included the scrapped ships in preferential tax policy since july 1 2015 the eligible shipbreaking enterprises can obtain 30 penalty vat refund when dismantling and processing non ferrous metals and steel of scrapped ships sat 2015 from january 2016 onwards the provisional tax rate for the import of hulk tariffs has been adjusted from the original 3 mfn rate to a temporary tax rate of only 1 state council 2015 when chinese shipbreaking enterprises declare their imported ships the tax rate drops to 18 17 from 20 51 which can reduce 2 34 of the import tax burden with the surge of green revolution all over the world governments have strengthened legislation and supervision to protect and improve their environmental conditions in this case green shipbreaking will become the developing trend of shipbreaking industry 3 the analysis of hazardous materials in the shipbreaking process shipbreaking industry brings a lot of harms and dangers including fire explosion and falling objects etc these dangers can be avoided with careful operations what we focus on is the hazardous materials caused or released in the shipbreaking process which may result in some harms to the environment and human the ships built in early year often contained various toxic and hazardous materials which is because the science technology and human environmental awareness were limited then as a result of the advancement of technology there is a growing sense that these toxic and hazardous materials may endanger human health and the environment dozens of materials which are recognized as harmful to human are prohibited for use in the shipbuilding industry imo 2009 many ships to be dismantled were built in 1970s and 1980s even in 1960s so some legally prohibited materials such as asbestos still widely exist in many old ships therefore shipbreaking is a kind of industry that may cause serious environment labor safety and occupational health issues 3 1 asbestos asbestos is widely used in traditional shipbuilding industry it is non toxic but it can release fine fibers during the demolition process these fibers can attach to and get deposited in the lung after inhalation and then cause lung diseases asbestos has been certified as a carcinogen by the international center for research on cancer who 2006 a study shows that the elevated trend of cancer incidence for overall cancer esophagus cancer and trachea bronchus and lung cancer among shipbreaking workers is related with asbestos exposure wu et al 2015 now the disposal of asbestos mainly is to infiltrate first and then remove it manually although this method largely reduces asbestos fibers asbestos residues are still unavoidable and there are potential hazards to human health 3 2 pcbs because of the desirable properties pcbs may exist in various equipment and materials around the old ships in the solid or liquid form pcbs is one of precedent controlled 12 persistent organic pollutants under the stockholm convention and also is one of prohibited chemical substances in the shipbuilding industry according to the hong kong convention imo 2009 pcbs can accumulate in living organism and it is proved that pcbs can cause endocrine disorders and have neurotoxicity reproductive toxicity carcinogenicity teratogenicity and mutagenicity gray 2002 pcbs also have a long term pollution on natural water ge 2007 the thermal decomposition of pcbs can produce more toxic gases such as pcdd and pcdf etc so when dismantling the equipment containing pcbs the open flame is forbidden 3 3 solid foam solid foam is a class of polymer material with wide application it bonds closely to the ship which determines that flame cutting is the only way for dismantling during the cutting operation there are many hazardous materials produced such as styrene hydrogen cyanide co formaldehyde acetaldehyde etc liu et al 2014 these materials can pass to the breathing system and do various extent damage to operators under the condition of no effective alternative method increasing the effective exchange of the air is the main way to reduce the harm but its environmental damage has not yet been taken seriously so there are no any restrictive measures on the pollution emission yet 3 4 fiberglass fiberglass applied widely in old ships is a kind of excellent inorganic nonmetallic material the fine fibers produced in the demolition process can cause minor damages on human zeng 2002 fiberglass has not been listed as toxic and hazardous test items by conventions or specifications yet so to some extent the treatment of fiberglass often has been ignored see fig 7 see fig 8 11 3 5 other hazardous materials besides many waste solids liquids and gases are produced in the shipbreaking process which can add serious environmental burdens although most of these wastes have no toxicity the large number of them and the profound impact on the environment cannot be ignored waste oils include residual crude oil fuel oil lubricant hydraulic oil and other oils in the engine room oil tank oil tube and hydraulic system and there are also hydrocarbons the main component of oils in oily ballast water bilge water tank washing water oil sludge oily sewage produced by cleaning engine room the global shipbreaking industry produces 400000 1300000 tons of waste oils every year dlmu 2010 in the ship and platform to be dismantled ballast water could be 3500 tons and oil sludge and oily sewage could be 5 tons if let the waste oils and sewage flow into surrounding waters it will endanger navigation and human life and may threaten natural resources and manmade resources their adverse effects on the environment are direct and long term and their threat on wildlife is even fatal their toxicity threatens to natural resources birds mammals and a large range of complex marine food chain the transboundary movement of ballast water around the world can cause a series of environmental and ecological problems even species extinction which will bring huge economic losses and disasters to people wang et al 2005 3 6 hot cutting technology and its socio environmental harm besides above hazardous materials existing in the ship the shipbreaking operations also cause some pollution and emissions in the shipbreaking process cutting technology is widely used and at present most of shipbreaking yards use acetylene gas generated by calcium carbide as the hot cutting gas acetylene cutting produces a lot of emissions dismantling one light displacement ton ship consumes about 1 kg calcium carbide 12 kg oxygen 10l water and produces 1 kg carbide slag dlmu 2010 the paints on the deck and outer plates contain a variety of lead compounds such as red lead lead carbonate commonly used as anti corrosion agent and in the shipbreaking process hot cutting makes the paints on the shipboard burn and then produce toxic fumes especially leaded vapors of which long term inhalation can cause chronic cumulative lead poisoning xu 2009 pcbs and solid foam in the ship can also produce toxic gases under high temperature since shipbreaking yards use acetylene gas for cutting operation the calcium carbide exhaust gas contains a small amount of irritant hydrogen sulfide and phosphine gas and long term inhalation will affect human respiratory health zhang 2016 at the same time acetylene cutting can easily lead to some potentially dangerous conditions such as combustion suffocation fire and explosion in the shipbreaking process without the proper procedures and requirements it s often easy to cause above accidents so that the pollutants in the hulk will be released into the atmosphere it can cause environmental pollution and may lead to the workers in a certain dangerous situation at the same time in order to reduce the environmental pressure caused by acetylene natural gas cutting is applied to the shipbreaking operations as a more environmentally friendly cutting technology this technology uses environmental resources such as propane or methane which only produce water and carbon dioxide it has certain advantages in cleaning economy environmental protection safety and other aspects gong et al 2008 however this technology has some disadvantages compared with acetylene the flame temperature of natural gas is lower cutting speed is slower etc besides the natural gas cutting is still hot cutting so toxic and hazardous materials caused by high temperature will still lead to environmental pollution hot cutting method also has its limitation on cutting above hazardous materials to prevent the fibers of asbestos or glass it requires dismantling the paneling and products manually as full as possible and sealing them up in time heating pcbs can produce toxic gases so when dismantling the equipment containing pcbs the open flame is forbidden for the solid foam bonds closely to the hull flame cutting is the only way to dismantle it and therefore toxic gases are unavoidably produced which will bring tremendous threat to the environment and workers health with the surge of green revolution all over the world governments have strengthened legislation and supervision to protect and improve their environmental conditions in this case green shipbreaking will become the developing trend of shipbreaking industry in the shipbreaking process greener technology will avoid some hazardous materials and danger factors which is important for the environment and workers health however greener way often means more advanced and complex technology and it will significantly increase the cost of shipbreaking therefore the environmental protection requirements and cost control are the double challenges faced by the shipbreaking industry which makes the technological process of shipbreaking and the disposal of toxic and hazardous materials particularly important 4 the study on green shipbreaking cutting technology previous studies on the shipbreaking process have generally focused on prohibiting or restricting the hazardous materials standardizing shipbreaking activities and putting forward some operational suggestions and some governments and organizations have formulated related regulations to reduce the harm to health environment and safety imo 2009 imo 2011 in this paper based on the available relevant laws and regulations we focus on changing the cutting method to avoid hazardous materials and dangerous factors caused by hot cutting many hazardous materials come from the hot cutting process without hot cutting many materials such as pcbs paints and solid foam can avoid producing toxic gases under high temperature however manual cutting has great workload and low efficiency in this way this paper suggests using abrasive water jet cutting to replace traditional hot cutting method thus avoiding heating at high temperature and reducing the release of toxic gases abrasive water jet is a novel processing technology developed on the basis of water jet cutting technology in the early 1980s kahlman et al 1983 abrasive water jet uses water as the medium to form high pressure water jet and get great energy by intensifier and then adds abrasives into high pressure water by mixing machine to form two phase flow hashish 1991 abrasive the main part of abrasive water jet has the characteristics of high intensity high frequency high abrasivity and long loading time high pressure water has good ability to drill and deliver meanwhile it can force abrasives to impact with high frequency and high concentration chen 2011 so abrasive water jet can impact and cut workpiece with high efficiency abrasive water jet has a wide range of application in various industries in the field of military abrasive water jet can be successfully applied to the safe destruction of waste ammunitions zhao and zhou 2011 in the oil and gas development industry vessels equipped with abrasive water jet system may play a part in cutting work lifesaving work demolition repair work and underwater construction work on offshore platforms abrasive water jet technology has been successfully applied in ship building and repairing and platform demolition project wang et al 2011 zhou et al 2000 which indicates that the technology is mature and reliable and it has broad application prospects at the same time valuable construction experience and technical foundation have been accumulated applying abrasive water jet cutting to shipbreaking process has certain advantages this paper studies the feasibility of applying abrasive water jet cutting in the shipbreaking process from aspects of its implementation environmental protection safety efficiency and economy moreover this paper also discusses some deficiencies of the present technology 4 1 the implementation of awj in the shipbreaking process the pre cleaning process includes removing some detachable equipment and items dismantling some hazardous materials in the pre cleaning process abrasive water jet cutting technology can be used to dismantle the asbestos containing materials acm the water can soak asbestos and wash fibers away to prevent dust emissions before starting to dismantle acm it requires sealing the cabin containing asbestos and installing the associated equipment outside to make the air pressure inside the cabin lower than outside cover all openings of the working zone by plastic sheets to form an enclosed area and then workers with full personal protective equipment enter the working zone and use portable abrasive water jet to cut acm according to different situations control the abrasive concentration even zero abrasive to get better cutting effect after the cutting process recycle the waste abrasives and fragments in time and seal them up in bags tightly use sealing strip seal the cutting position then clean the working zone and use the hose to wash away the cabin the waste water and the mixture should be collected to the special sedimentation tank other dismantled materials should be stored in a special warehouse and disposed properly abrasive water jet can also cut the products containing pcbs solid foam and fiberglass to avoid producing other hazardous materials under high temperature in the cutting process workers should wear professional personal protective equipment to keep safe be sure to pay attention to ventilation and ensure the air quality of workplace meets the safety standards the first shipbreaking process refers to cutting the vessel into big blocks and then sending them to another site for further dismantling in this process the dock is large the size requirement on equipment is low so shipbreaking yard can construct one or several large abrasive water jet cutting equipment at the dock and the abrasive box and water tank can be placed beside them the nozzle should be designed to that the speed and direction are adjustable and the pressure should be adjustable to meet the different engineering requirements the shipbreaking process should be top down and outside in maintain the hull s strength and keep it afloat and check the main plate of the hull regularly the cutting position is better in welding line cut through a fixed cutting point at first and then move the nozzle at a certain speed along the specified direction the equipment can cut the ship under remote control to protect the workers safety after dismantling the hull into several sections hoist them to the second site for further dismantling clean and recycle waste abrasives at the dock regularly the secondary shipbreaking process is a kind of work that cuts the blocks and interior structures into pieces at the site the site is relatively limited so in this case portable abrasive water jet equipment with low pressure is necessary for the cutting process the technology of this equipment has been mature it can cut 0 50 mm steel plate ji 2016 which can meet most of the cutting requirements the worker can install and control the adjustable lever to adjust the cutting position and angle and operate the cutting process from a safe distance install universal wheels at the bottom of equipment for movement to add flexibility after the cutting process recycle waste abrasives at the site in time 4 2 environmental protection the abrasive water jet cutting technology itself is green it only uses water and abrasives in the cutting process and abrasive water mixture produced can be recycled by recovery device the technology does not produce hazardous pollutants abrasive water jet can cut the ship systematically and cause little vibration and little impact on the surroundings and it do no damage on operating environment in addition abrasive water jet cutting has low noise besides the noise caused by high pressure water pumps and hydraulic power equipment there is no other significant noise and cutting process is only the impact process of high pressure water which will not produce obvious noise nor will it affect sea creatures and fisheries zhang et al 2012 abrasive water jet cutting technology has special advantages in the shipbreaking process as a cold working method it will not generate high temperature which may lead to the combustion of paints pcbs and solid foam and so on so it produces fewer toxic and hazardous substances moreover abrasive water jet cutting technology can eliminate the hazardous emissions caused by acetylene and reduce the substances that damage the human body health in the shipbreaking process when it works high pressure water will flush away the waste particles in the cutting process it can avoid dusts produced by asbestos and fiberglass to reduce their chronical damage on people besides abrasive water jet only consumes electricity compared with hot cutting method it can remarkably reduce the emission of greenhouse gases such as co2 and contribute to the mitigation of global warming above all abrasive water jet cutting technology has certain advantages in reducing environmental pollution preserving the ecological environment and other aspects abrasive water jet cutting process is mainly the process that high pressure water and abrasives impact on steel so it will not produce pollution emissions or toxic and hazardous materials and it has no impact on ecological balance and can reduce the pollution and greenhouse gas emission caused by conventional hot cutting process thus abrasive water jet cutting technology is a green cutting method 4 3 safety in the first shipbreaking process abrasive water jet cutting technology can use the control system to operate the cutting process so it will not cause harm to workers in the secondary shipbreaking process workers with personal protective equipment should stand at a safe distance from the equipment to avoid getting hurt in the shipbreaking process cold cutting can avoid the occurrence of high temperature suffocation fire explosion and other accidents which greatly ensures the safety of workers the use of abrasive water jet cutting technology can make the whole shipbreaking operation in a safer environment for some devices and cabins that have been exposed to or soaked in various oils for years improper operations may lead to fire or explosion during the dismantling process undoubtedly conventional hot cutting takes a great accident risk abrasive water jet cutting technology is safer than hot cutting some researchers have carried out safety experiments on the abrasive water jet cutting under oil and gas condition and studied the law of spark generation material heating and cutting safety under oil and gas condition respectively zhang et al 2016 the conclusions are as follows abrasive water jet cutting produces pretty weak sparks only when it cuts some materials like carbon steel which demonstrates that sparks produced by abrasive water jet cutting has little safety threat in the oil and gas environment due to the cooling effect of water abrasive water jet cutting method heats materials for short duration the maximum temperature of different materials is all below 100 c which is much lower than the combustion and explosion temperature of oil and gas and it does not have the condition of igniting oil and gas environment it is safe and feasible to use abrasive water jet to cut ships under oil and gas condition 4 4 efficiency abrasive water jet cutting can be used for processing both hard materials like titanium steel brass aluminium stone glass and any kind of composites and soft materials like rubber and foam akkurt et al 2004 therefore most of the materials in the ship can be cutted by abrasive water jet hot cutting often produces metal contamination heat affected zone and deformation so the materials to be cutted may form large burrs or pollution that affecting the secondary use and the volume of recycled steel will be decreased and the utilization rate is low which results in certain resource waste and economic loss abrasive water jet cutting is based on the principle of water erosion rather than the utilization of heat therefore this cutting method can obtain smooth cutting edge and has no thermal deformation hascalik et al 2007 or slags produced the materials almost don t need reprocessing so the cutted steel can be quickly recycled and reused the conventional hot cutting needs many workers to cut ship manually which often needs to consume a lot of manpower and result in high labor costs this method is slow and has low accuracy in the first shipbreaking process abrasive water jet technology can realize automation of cutting process with computer control which greatly improves productivity the cutting speed of abrasive water jet can be adjusted by the water pressure abrasive concentration and nozzle form etc chen 2011 taking cutting 25 mm steel plate for example the cutting speed of acetylene is 350 mm min yu et al 2010 and referring to the experience from dismantling offshore structure in china abrasive water jet can get the similar speed when the pressure is set to about 300 mpa zhou et al 2000 in addition abrasive water jet can be applied to underwater cutting in the shipbreaking process the cracking or leakage problems may occur locally resulting in the whole or part of ship stranding on the beach and the ship can t be dragged to the shore with the buoyancy produced by tide the manual gas cutting can t complete the cutting work so the shipbreaking can t be carried out but abrasive water jet cutting machine with hydraulic pump can complete the cutting work under the water therefore abrasive water jet cutting has advantages in improving the cutting quality cutting flexibility and productivity and it has pretty wide range of applications 4 5 economy according to chinese current situation the price of acetylene is about 24 yuan kg the cutting cost of acetylene is about 12 yuan hour yu et al 2010 for abrasive water jet the energy cost is 1 yuan hour the nozzle needs replacement approximately every 250 h so the cost of nozzle is 1 yuan hour the attrition rate of abrasive is 30 l per hour and it costs 18 yuan per hour the total cost is 20 yuan per hour taking into account other costs such as pump cleaning water maintenance etc it s about 22 yuan per hour zhou et al 2000 with today s technologies the cutting cost of abrasive water jet is relatively higher than hot cutting method and the initial investment of abrasive water jet cutting technology is large but it can bring great environmental benefits and long term social benefits moreover abrasive water jet cutting technology can recycle the cutted scrap steel as much as possible to improve resource utilization and economy reducing abrasive loss is an important way to reduce the cost it has been shown that hashish 2012 the cutting length per unit abrasive mass is directly proportional to the pressure assuming that the cutting speed is proportional to the kinetic energy of abrasive therefore increasing the pressure can effectively reduce the abrasive loss and cost at the same time the waste abrasive water mixture can be recycled through the recovery device the study has shown that urbitnek 2001 through the certain way of recycling drying separation etc the initial recovery rate can be up to 53 and it can still be recycled after reusing and the recovery rate is higher than the initial recovery abrasive water jet cutting can recycle and reuse the waste abrasives with less cost so as to achieve the purpose of saving abrasive cost and resources and it has a certain social and economic benefits based on the above we compared the hot cutting method to the abrasive water jet cutting method from different aspects as shown in table 1 4 6 deficiencies as an emerging technology the idea of applying abrasive water jet to shipbreaking has some deficiencies we will discuss the deficiencies for the future improvement 1 when abrasive water jet cuts the products containing asbestos pcbs and fiberglass etc improper operation and untimely recycling may cause pollution and release 2 the large abrasive water jet cutting equipment in the first shipbreaking process needs specialized design research and construction the initial investment is huge which may be a heavy burden for shipbreaking yards now at the same time periodical examination and maintenance of the equipment also add the cost of manpower and materials 3 the pre cleaning and secondary process still requires a lot of manpower compared with manual hot cutting the cost of manpower may not decrease and at present the cost of raw materials may be higher 4 after the cutting process the cleaning and recycling of waste abrasives will add additional costs 5 conclusion nowadays green shipbreaking has become a trend shipbreaking activities cause all sorts of serious problems about safety environment and occupational health this paper introduces some hazardous materials in the shipbreaking and suggests using abrasive water jet cutting in place of conventional hot cutting this paper studies the feasibility of the application of abrasive water jet to shipbreaking process and it has certain advantages in economy safety efficiency and environmental protection 1 abrasive water jet cutting method is a green technology and it won t produce pollutants or hazardous materials caused by high temperature 2 abrasive water jet cutting hardly can hurt workers or damage sites and the possibility of accidents is much lower 3 abrasive water jet cutting has fast speed high accuracy good quality and flexible cutting process abrasive water jet can be used to cut various materials and can be applied under water 4 although the initial investment of abrasive water jet is large the raw materials are recyclable and the cost of recycling steel decreases which can bring a certain social and economic benefits 5 the advantages in many aspects and the technical maturity of abrasive water jet technology indicate that it is feasible to apply in the shipbreaking process although there are some deficiencies especially in the economy but it has incomparable advantages in environmental protection and safety we hope to improve the technology and make the application to shipbreaking a reality acknowledgements this work was supported by state key laboratory of hydraulic engineering simulation and safety and collaborative innovation center for

23306,this paper introduces the status of the chinese and international shipbreaking industry and discusses the hazardous shipbreaking materials and the effects on environment and human therefore this paper explores green shipbreaking technology and puts forward the application of the abrasive water jet cutting technology to the shipbreaking process and studies the feasibility of the application from the aspects of its implementation environmental protection safety efficiency and economy moreover this paper also discusses the deficiencies of this idea keywords shipbreaking hazardous materials abrasive water jet cutting green technology 1 the shipbreaking industry overview the global economic growth has promoted the global maritime trade thus greatly promoting the development of the shipbuilding industry in general the life of a ship is usually 20 30 years the ships built at the end of the last century have ended or will end their services and the dismantling of these ships has become a worthy consideration in recent years the recovery of the global economic is slow the situation of excess transportation capacity continues and energy efficiency design index eedi has officially entered into force imo 2011 these factors have led to an obvious trend that ships are sent for recycling at an earlier age for many ship owners it is more economical to declare a ship unfit for service instead of opting to service or modify the ship under the influence of the global financial crisis the continuous depression of shipping business has resulted in a sharp increase of ships to dismantled mao 2009 therefore the shipbreaking industry has a large market around the world see fig 1 6 although the shipbreaking process may cause a range of harmful consequences including air pollution water pollution soil pollution and explosion etc it is beneficial for the world s environment and resource conservation shipbreaking industry as a green industry has become a part of the circular economy since dismantling and processing old vessels rahman et al 2016 on the one hand it provides the shipowner with the disposal service of the old vessels on the other hand shipbreaking allows the materials from the ship especially steel to be recycled and made into new products this lowers the demand for mined iron ore and reduces energy use in the steelmaking process so it is extremely important to optimize and improve shipbreaking technology and effectively reduce pollution this article introduces the status of the chinese and international shipbreaking industry from the respects of shipbreaking methods social environment economic cost environmental protection measures and so on it analyses and studies the hazardous materials during shipbreaking process such as asbestos pcbs solid foam fiberglass etc and their negative impacts on environment and human for conventional hot cutting technology this article puts forward the application of a greener technology abrasive water jet cutting method in the shipbreaking process and studies the feasibility of the application from the aspects of implementation environmental protection safety efficiency and economy 2 the present status of shipbreaking industry the shipbreaking yards mainly located in bangladesh india china and pakistan the annual shipbreaking tonnage of these four asian countries accounts for 85 percent of the global total ocn 2017 and other shipbreaking shipyards located in the mediterranean area and turkey more than 700 ships are sent for recycling every year galley 2014 and in 2009 the shipbreaking market hit a 13 year high sarraf et al 2010 according to clarkson s institute clarkson 2017 the latest statistics on the trend of shipbreaking shows that in 2016 933 ships a total tonnage of 44 4 million dwt were dismantled in total an increase of 14 over the same period last year in 2016 the shipbreaking activities of bulk cargo ship and container ship played an important role 65 and 18 of the total tonnage respectively the shipbreaking tonnage of the four asian countries bangladesh china india and pakistan accounts for 90 percent of the global total in 2016 by this token the development momentum of the shipbreaking industry is still strong at this stage and the recovery of shipping industry still has a long way to go the shipbreaking yards in south asia often use beaching method to dismantle ships taking the ship onto beach and then dismantling the ship there in which case the process and related equipment are simple so the cost of site and fixed equipment is low moreover the labor of shipbreaking markets is abundant cheap and skilled the direct and indirect utilization of dismantled goods is high and the developed secondary market can offer a recycling way for dismantled goods cnsa 2017 but it is clear that during the shipbreaking process environmental pollution and workers safety problems are worrisome in these areas the shipbreaking yards in china mainly use the dock or wharf method to dismantle ships which can effectively reduce the pollution caused by hazardous materials in such way china has won more shipbreaking orders that requiring environment protection and due to the advanced technology chinese shipbreaking yards tend to dismantle large tankers and very large crude carriers involving complicated technical difficulty and huge profits xu 2009 in china the yangtze river delta and the pearl river delta play the leading role in the shipbreaking industry and some coastal areas develop side by side zhu 2009 since 2009 china always occupies the top 3 of the amount on shipbreaking in the world wang 2016 which provides vast regenerated metal resources for circular economy the shipbreaking capacity of china has been widely recognized around the world china has greatly promoted the safe and green shipbreaking industry and improved energy saving and emission reduction which has made active contribution and obtained the good social efficiency in china the scrap steel price at home and abroad has hung upside down for a long time and the scrap steel market demand is not prosperous the tight export restriction on scrap steel and the wharf or dock shipbreaking method increase the environmental protection and safety inputs above factors resulted in that the shipbreaking price gap between china and the south asian countries has become larger and larger during twelfth five year in bangladesh india and pakistan every light ton of scrapped ship price generally is 150 200 dollars higher than chinese enterprises cnsa 2017 the huge difference made chinese enterprises lose the competitive advantage on buying the ships to be dismantled so that the number of imported ship to drop significantly in recent years yet although economic efficiency is not good china s shipbreaking industry insists on promoting the green shipbreaking research promotion and management work and continues to invest in shipbreaking safety and environmental protection facilities previously in china imported scrap steel and raw ore were tariff free but imported ships needed to pay the 3 tariff and the scrapped ships as the recycling resources have few subsidies or tax breaks recently china has adjusted the tax policy involving shipbreaking and included the scrapped ships in preferential tax policy since july 1 2015 the eligible shipbreaking enterprises can obtain 30 penalty vat refund when dismantling and processing non ferrous metals and steel of scrapped ships sat 2015 from january 2016 onwards the provisional tax rate for the import of hulk tariffs has been adjusted from the original 3 mfn rate to a temporary tax rate of only 1 state council 2015 when chinese shipbreaking enterprises declare their imported ships the tax rate drops to 18 17 from 20 51 which can reduce 2 34 of the import tax burden with the surge of green revolution all over the world governments have strengthened legislation and supervision to protect and improve their environmental conditions in this case green shipbreaking will become the developing trend of shipbreaking industry 3 the analysis of hazardous materials in the shipbreaking process shipbreaking industry brings a lot of harms and dangers including fire explosion and falling objects etc these dangers can be avoided with careful operations what we focus on is the hazardous materials caused or released in the shipbreaking process which may result in some harms to the environment and human the ships built in early year often contained various toxic and hazardous materials which is because the science technology and human environmental awareness were limited then as a result of the advancement of technology there is a growing sense that these toxic and hazardous materials may endanger human health and the environment dozens of materials which are recognized as harmful to human are prohibited for use in the shipbuilding industry imo 2009 many ships to be dismantled were built in 1970s and 1980s even in 1960s so some legally prohibited materials such as asbestos still widely exist in many old ships therefore shipbreaking is a kind of industry that may cause serious environment labor safety and occupational health issues 3 1 asbestos asbestos is widely used in traditional shipbuilding industry it is non toxic but it can release fine fibers during the demolition process these fibers can attach to and get deposited in the lung after inhalation and then cause lung diseases asbestos has been certified as a carcinogen by the international center for research on cancer who 2006 a study shows that the elevated trend of cancer incidence for overall cancer esophagus cancer and trachea bronchus and lung cancer among shipbreaking workers is related with asbestos exposure wu et al 2015 now the disposal of asbestos mainly is to infiltrate first and then remove it manually although this method largely reduces asbestos fibers asbestos residues are still unavoidable and there are potential hazards to human health 3 2 pcbs because of the desirable properties pcbs may exist in various equipment and materials around the old ships in the solid or liquid form pcbs is one of precedent controlled 12 persistent organic pollutants under the stockholm convention and also is one of prohibited chemical substances in the shipbuilding industry according to the hong kong convention imo 2009 pcbs can accumulate in living organism and it is proved that pcbs can cause endocrine disorders and have neurotoxicity reproductive toxicity carcinogenicity teratogenicity and mutagenicity gray 2002 pcbs also have a long term pollution on natural water ge 2007 the thermal decomposition of pcbs can produce more toxic gases such as pcdd and pcdf etc so when dismantling the equipment containing pcbs the open flame is forbidden 3 3 solid foam solid foam is a class of polymer material with wide application it bonds closely to the ship which determines that flame cutting is the only way for dismantling during the cutting operation there are many hazardous materials produced such as styrene hydrogen cyanide co formaldehyde acetaldehyde etc liu et al 2014 these materials can pass to the breathing system and do various extent damage to operators under the condition of no effective alternative method increasing the effective exchange of the air is the main way to reduce the harm but its environmental damage has not yet been taken seriously so there are no any restrictive measures on the pollution emission yet 3 4 fiberglass fiberglass applied widely in old ships is a kind of excellent inorganic nonmetallic material the fine fibers produced in the demolition process can cause minor damages on human zeng 2002 fiberglass has not been listed as toxic and hazardous test items by conventions or specifications yet so to some extent the treatment of fiberglass often has been ignored see fig 7 see fig 8 11 3 5 other hazardous materials besides many waste solids liquids and gases are produced in the shipbreaking process which can add serious environmental burdens although most of these wastes have no toxicity the large number of them and the profound impact on the environment cannot be ignored waste oils include residual crude oil fuel oil lubricant hydraulic oil and other oils in the engine room oil tank oil tube and hydraulic system and there are also hydrocarbons the main component of oils in oily ballast water bilge water tank washing water oil sludge oily sewage produced by cleaning engine room the global shipbreaking industry produces 400000 1300000 tons of waste oils every year dlmu 2010 in the ship and platform to be dismantled ballast water could be 3500 tons and oil sludge and oily sewage could be 5 tons if let the waste oils and sewage flow into surrounding waters it will endanger navigation and human life and may threaten natural resources and manmade resources their adverse effects on the environment are direct and long term and their threat on wildlife is even fatal their toxicity threatens to natural resources birds mammals and a large range of complex marine food chain the transboundary movement of ballast water around the world can cause a series of environmental and ecological problems even species extinction which will bring huge economic losses and disasters to people wang et al 2005 3 6 hot cutting technology and its socio environmental harm besides above hazardous materials existing in the ship the shipbreaking operations also cause some pollution and emissions in the shipbreaking process cutting technology is widely used and at present most of shipbreaking yards use acetylene gas generated by calcium carbide as the hot cutting gas acetylene cutting produces a lot of emissions dismantling one light displacement ton ship consumes about 1 kg calcium carbide 12 kg oxygen 10l water and produces 1 kg carbide slag dlmu 2010 the paints on the deck and outer plates contain a variety of lead compounds such as red lead lead carbonate commonly used as anti corrosion agent and in the shipbreaking process hot cutting makes the paints on the shipboard burn and then produce toxic fumes especially leaded vapors of which long term inhalation can cause chronic cumulative lead poisoning xu 2009 pcbs and solid foam in the ship can also produce toxic gases under high temperature since shipbreaking yards use acetylene gas for cutting operation the calcium carbide exhaust gas contains a small amount of irritant hydrogen sulfide and phosphine gas and long term inhalation will affect human respiratory health zhang 2016 at the same time acetylene cutting can easily lead to some potentially dangerous conditions such as combustion suffocation fire and explosion in the shipbreaking process without the proper procedures and requirements it s often easy to cause above accidents so that the pollutants in the hulk will be released into the atmosphere it can cause environmental pollution and may lead to the workers in a certain dangerous situation at the same time in order to reduce the environmental pressure caused by acetylene natural gas cutting is applied to the shipbreaking operations as a more environmentally friendly cutting technology this technology uses environmental resources such as propane or methane which only produce water and carbon dioxide it has certain advantages in cleaning economy environmental protection safety and other aspects gong et al 2008 however this technology has some disadvantages compared with acetylene the flame temperature of natural gas is lower cutting speed is slower etc besides the natural gas cutting is still hot cutting so toxic and hazardous materials caused by high temperature will still lead to environmental pollution hot cutting method also has its limitation on cutting above hazardous materials to prevent the fibers of asbestos or glass it requires dismantling the paneling and products manually as full as possible and sealing them up in time heating pcbs can produce toxic gases so when dismantling the equipment containing pcbs the open flame is forbidden for the solid foam bonds closely to the hull flame cutting is the only way to dismantle it and therefore toxic gases are unavoidably produced which will bring tremendous threat to the environment and workers health with the surge of green revolution all over the world governments have strengthened legislation and supervision to protect and improve their environmental conditions in this case green shipbreaking will become the developing trend of shipbreaking industry in the shipbreaking process greener technology will avoid some hazardous materials and danger factors which is important for the environment and workers health however greener way often means more advanced and complex technology and it will significantly increase the cost of shipbreaking therefore the environmental protection requirements and cost control are the double challenges faced by the shipbreaking industry which makes the technological process of shipbreaking and the disposal of toxic and hazardous materials particularly important 4 the study on green shipbreaking cutting technology previous studies on the shipbreaking process have generally focused on prohibiting or restricting the hazardous materials standardizing shipbreaking activities and putting forward some operational suggestions and some governments and organizations have formulated related regulations to reduce the harm to health environment and safety imo 2009 imo 2011 in this paper based on the available relevant laws and regulations we focus on changing the cutting method to avoid hazardous materials and dangerous factors caused by hot cutting many hazardous materials come from the hot cutting process without hot cutting many materials such as pcbs paints and solid foam can avoid producing toxic gases under high temperature however manual cutting has great workload and low efficiency in this way this paper suggests using abrasive water jet cutting to replace traditional hot cutting method thus avoiding heating at high temperature and reducing the

industry vessels equipped with abrasive water jet system may play a part in cutting work lifesaving work demolition repair work and underwater construction work on offshore platforms abrasive water jet technology has been successfully applied in ship building and repairing and platform demolition project wang et al 2011 zhou et al 2000 which indicates that the technology is mature and reliable and it has broad application prospects at the same time valuable construction experience and technical foundation have been accumulated applying abrasive water jet cutting to shipbreaking process has certain advantages this paper studies the feasibility of applying abrasive water jet cutting in the shipbreaking process from aspects of its implementation environmental protection safety efficiency

after the cutting process recycle the waste abrasives and fragments in time and seal them up in bags tightly use sealing strip seal the cutting position then clean the working zone and use the hose to

abrasive water jet can also cut the products containing pcbs solid foam and fiberglass to avoid producing other hazardous materials under high temperature in the cutting process workers should wear professional personal protective equipment to keep safe be sure to pay attention to ventilation and ensure the air quality of workplace meets the safety standards the first shipbreaking process refers to cutting the vessel into big blocks and then sending them to another site for further dismantling in this process the dock is large the size requirement on equipment is low so shipbreaking yard can

along the specified direction the equipment can cut the ship under remote control to protect the workers safety after dismantling the hull into several sections hoist them to the second site for further dismantling clean and recycle waste abrasives at the dock regularly the secondary shipbreaking process is a kind of work that cuts the blocks and interior structures into pieces at the site the site is relatively limited so in this case portable abrasive water jet equipment with low pressure is necessary for the cutting process the technology of this equipment has been mature it can cut 0 50 mm steel plate ji 2016 which can meet most of the cutting requirements the worker can install and control the adjustable lever to adjust the cutting position and angle and operate the cutting process from a safe distance install universal wheels at the bottom of equipment for movement to add flexibility after the cutting process recycle waste abrasives at the site in time 4 2 environmental protection the abrasive water jet cutting technology itself is green it only uses water and abrasives in the cutting process and abrasive water mixture produced can be recycled by recovery device the technology does not produce hazardous pollutants abrasive water jet can cut the ship systematically and cause little vibration and little impact on the surroundings and it do no damage on operating environment in addition abrasive water jet cutting has low noise besides the noise caused by high pressure water pumps and hydraulic power equipment there is no other significant noise and cutting process is only the impact process of high pressure water which will not produce obvious noise nor will it affect sea creatures and fisheries zhang et al 2012 abrasive water jet cutting technology has special advantages in the shipbreaking process as a cold working method it will not generate high temperature which may lead to the combustion of paints pcbs and solid foam and so on so it produces fewer toxic and hazardous substances moreover abrasive water jet cutting technology can eliminate the hazardous emissions caused by acetylene and reduce the substances that damage the human body health in the shipbreaking process when it works high pressure water will flush away the waste particles in the cutting process it can avoid dusts produced by asbestos and fiberglass to reduce their chronical damage on people besides abrasive water jet only consumes electricity compared with hot cutting method it can remarkably reduce the emission of greenhouse gases such as co2 and contribute to the mitigation of global warming above all abrasive water jet cutting technology has certain advantages in reducing environmental pollution preserving the ecological environment and other aspects abrasive water jet cutting process is mainly the process that high pressure water and abrasives impact on steel so it will not produce pollution emissions or toxic and hazardous materials and it has no impact on ecological balance and can reduce the pollution and greenhouse gas emission caused by conventional hot cutting process thus abrasive water jet cutting technology is a green cutting method 4 3 safety in the first shipbreaking process abrasive water jet cutting technology can use the control system to operate the cutting process so it will not cause harm to workers in the secondary shipbreaking process workers with personal protective equipment should stand at a safe distance from the equipment to avoid getting hurt in the shipbreaking process cold cutting can avoid the occurrence of high temperature suffocation fire explosion and other accidents which greatly ensures the safety of workers the use of abrasive water jet cutting technology can make the whole shipbreaking operation in a safer environment for some devices and cabins that have been exposed to or soaked in various oils for years improper operations may lead to fire or explosion during the dismantling process undoubtedly conventional hot cutting takes a great accident risk abrasive water jet cutting technology is safer than hot cutting some researchers have carried out safety experiments on the abrasive water jet cutting under oil and gas condition and studied the law of spark generation material heating and cutting safety under oil and gas condition respectively zhang et al 2016 the conclusions are as follows abrasive water jet cutting produces pretty weak sparks only when it cuts some materials like carbon steel which demonstrates that sparks produced by abrasive water jet cutting has little safety threat in the oil and gas environment due to the cooling effect of water abrasive water jet cutting method heats materials for short duration the maximum temperature of different materials is all below 100 c which is much lower than the combustion and explosion temperature of oil and gas and it does not have the condition of igniting oil and gas environment it is safe and feasible to use abrasive water jet to cut ships under oil and gas condition 4 4 efficiency abrasive water jet cutting can be used for processing both hard materials like titanium steel brass aluminium stone glass and any kind of composites and soft materials like rubber and foam akkurt et al 2004 therefore most of the materials in the ship can be cutted by abrasive water jet hot cutting often produces metal contamination heat affected zone and deformation so the materials to be cutted may form large burrs or pollution that affecting the secondary use and the volume of recycled steel will be decreased and the utilization rate is low which results in certain resource waste and economic loss abrasive water jet cutting is based on the principle of water erosion rather than the utilization of heat therefore this cutting method can obtain smooth cutting edge and has no thermal deformation hascalik et al 2007 or slags produced the materials almost don t need reprocessing so the cutted steel can be quickly recycled and reused the conventional hot cutting needs many workers to cut ship manually which often needs to consume a lot of manpower and result in high labor costs this method is slow and has low accuracy in the first shipbreaking process abrasive water jet technology can realize automation of cutting process with computer control which greatly improves productivity the cutting speed of abrasive water jet can be adjusted by the water pressure abrasive concentration and nozzle form etc chen 2011 taking cutting 25 mm steel plate for example the cutting speed of acetylene is 350 mm min yu et al 2010 and referring to the experience from dismantling offshore structure in china abrasive water jet can get the similar speed when the pressure is set to about 300 mpa zhou et al 2000 in addition abrasive water jet can be applied to underwater cutting in the shipbreaking process the cracking or leakage problems may occur locally resulting in the whole or part of ship stranding on the beach and the ship can t be dragged to the shore with the buoyancy produced by tide the manual gas cutting can t complete the cutting work so the shipbreaking can t be carried out but abrasive water jet cutting machine with hydraulic pump can complete the cutting work under the water therefore abrasive water jet cutting has advantages in improving the cutting quality cutting flexibility and productivity and it has pretty wide range of applications 4 5 economy according to chinese current situation the price of acetylene is about 24 yuan kg the cutting cost of acetylene is about 12 yuan hour yu et al 2010 for abrasive water jet the energy cost is 1 yuan hour the nozzle needs replacement approximately every 250 h so the cost of nozzle is 1 yuan hour the attrition rate of abrasive is 30 l per hour and it costs 18 yuan per hour the total cost is 20 yuan per hour taking into account other costs such as pump cleaning water maintenance etc it s about 22 yuan per hour zhou et al 2000 with today s technologies the cutting cost of abrasive water jet is relatively higher than hot cutting method and the initial investment of abrasive water jet cutting technology is large but it can bring great environmental benefits and long term social benefits moreover abrasive water jet cutting technology can recycle the cutted scrap steel as much as possible to improve resource utilization and economy reducing abrasive loss is an important way to reduce the cost it has been shown that hashish 2012 the cutting length per unit abrasive mass is directly proportional to the pressure assuming that the cutting speed is proportional to the kinetic energy of abrasive therefore increasing the pressure can effectively reduce the abrasive loss and cost at the same time the waste abrasive water mixture can be recycled through the recovery device the study has shown that urbitnek 2001 through the certain way of recycling drying separation etc the initial recovery rate can be up to 53 and it can still be recycled after reusing and the recovery rate is higher than the initial recovery abrasive water jet cutting can recycle and reuse the waste abrasives with less cost so as to achieve the purpose of saving abrasive cost and resources and it has a certain social and economic benefits based on the above we compared the hot cutting method to the abrasive water jet cutting method from different aspects as shown in table 1 4 6 deficiencies as an emerging technology the idea of applying abrasive water jet to shipbreaking has some deficiencies we will discuss the deficiencies for the future improvement 1 when abrasive water jet cuts the products containing asbestos pcbs and fiberglass etc improper operation and untimely recycling may cause pollution and release 2 the large abrasive water jet cutting equipment in the first shipbreaking process needs specialized design research and construction the initial investment is huge which may be a heavy burden for shipbreaking yards now at the same time periodical examination and maintenance of the equipment also add the cost of manpower and materials 3 the pre cleaning and secondary process still requires a lot of manpower compared with manual hot cutting the cost of manpower may not decrease and at present the cost of raw materials may be higher 4 after the cutting process the cleaning and recycling of waste abrasives will add additional costs 5 conclusion nowadays green shipbreaking has become a trend shipbreaking activities cause all sorts of serious problems about safety environment and occupational health this paper introduces some hazardous materials in the shipbreaking and suggests using abrasive water jet cutting in place of conventional hot cutting this paper studies the feasibility of the application of abrasive water jet to shipbreaking process and it has certain advantages in economy safety efficiency and environmental protection 1 abrasive water jet cutting method is a green technology and it won t produce pollutants or hazardous materials caused by high temperature 2 abrasive water jet cutting hardly can hurt workers or damage sites and the possibility of accidents is much lower 3 abrasive water jet cutting has fast speed high accuracy good quality and flexible cutting process abrasive water jet can be used to cut various materials and can be applied under water 4 although the initial investment of abrasive water jet is large the raw materials are recyclable and the cost of recycling steel decreases which can bring a certain social and economic benefits 5 the advantages in many aspects and the technical maturity of abrasive water jet technology indicate that it is feasible to apply in the shipbreaking process although there are some deficiencies especially in the economy but it has incomparable advantages in environmental protection and safety we hope to improve the technology and

23307,biofouling is an inevitable problem in marine aquaculture and it is prone to cause many negative effects on the hydrodynamic behavior of the aquaculture facility in this study the dominant biofouling on the netting of fish farms in the yellow sea of china was determined by field sampling plane nets with various levels of biofouling were obtained by submerging nets at different depths and for different durations drag acting on the biofouled nets in currents were investigated using laboratory experiment the results indicate that drag acting on the net increases with increasing level of biofouling compared to the clean net the accumulation of biofouling can lead to over 10 times more hydrodynamic load on nets flow fields around the biofouled nets were simulated using a porous media fluid model which was validated by corresponding laboratory experiment as the level of biofouling increases the flow velocity downstream from the net decreases continuously the net with the greatest level of biofouling produces the most serious shielding effect with 21 4 reduction in flow velocity using the proposed empirical equations both the drag on and flow velocity downstream from a hydroid fouled net can be predicted keywords aquaculture net biofouling drag coefficient laboratory experiment numerical simulation 1 introduction with the steady growth of world population and the continuous improvement of living standards the demands for high quality seafood continue to grow to fulfill this goal efforts must be paid to modern technology regarding to offshore aquaculture facilities and equipments in the aquaculture industry offshore net cages are becoming prevalent around the world a typical net cage is mainly composed of floating collar net chamber weight system and mooring system similar to other marine structures the infrastructure of the net cage suffers from the effects of biofouling in the open sea see fig 1 biofouling the accumulation of marine organisms is prone to leading to rapid occlusion of the netting mesh braithwaite et al 2007 which may causes the following disadvantages i biofouling communities acting as disease reservoirs can increase disease risk to the farmed fish fitridge et al 2012 ii the hydrodynamic forces acting on the net cage are dramatically increased which increases the risk of structural failure and fatigue damage of the net cage klebert et al 2013 iii the biofouled netting is easily deformed in currents and thus causes negative effect on the effective volume for the farmed fish and iv the attenuation of currents through the net cage is increased which decreases the water exchange and oxygen supply inside the net cage bi et al 2015a in addition the motion responses geometric deformation dynamic forces as well as flow fields regarding to the net cage are important for both design and maintenance of offshore aquaculture facilities thus the investigation on hydrodynamic characteristics of biofouled net has great significance for aquaculture engineering over the past decades a large number of studies have been carried out to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the net structure and the net cage see for example the review by klebert et al 2013 however there is paucity of research into the effects of biofouling on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the net structure or the net cage in the literature swift et al 2006 performed experiments both in a tow tank and in the field to measure the drag forces acting on biofouled plane nets overall drag force increased with both net solidity and volume of biofouling with considerable scatter which was attributed to the different species of the biofouling there are many different kinds of biofouling organisms related to the net cage e g hydroid mussel and algae etc bloecher et al 2013 the physical and geometrical characteristics as well as the distribution of the biofouling take various forms and have different effects on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the net cage thus a separation of biofouling types in future studies was suggested by swift et al 2006 in norway the leading producer of atlantic salmon the hydroid ectopleura larynx dominates biofouling communities on coastal fish farms during the peak of the biofouling season guenther et al 2010 therefore the biofouling of hydroid ectopleura larynx on salmon cage nets has become an important concern for the norwegian finfish industry gansel et al 2012 conducted physical model tests on six cylindrical metal nettings using piv technique to investigate the effect of porosity on the ventilation inside the cages and the vertical transports within the near wake it was found that heavy biofouling of aquacultural netting can lead to internal circulation which may dramatically reduce the ventilation of the fish cage gansel et al 2015 performed experimental study on both clean and fouled plane nets in a flume tank to evaluate the effect of hydroids an important biofouling organism in norwegian aquaculture on the forces acting on nettings the relationship between net solidity and drag force was assessed and a method was proposed to parameterize the effect of biofouling in terms of an increase in net solidity lader et al 2015 performed field tests to investigate the growth characteristics of hydroids that grow on a net and conducted laboratory experiments to study the hydrodynamic drag on the fouled twines using fabricated models of net twines with artificial hydroid fouling finally a curve fit showing the relationship among growth period hydroid length and drag coefficient for different reynolds numbers was made based on the measurements of the drag on twines with three different biofouling levels although much progress has been made to the best of our knowledge the effects of biofouling on the hydrodynamic characteristics of nets have not been studied systematically technical standards taking the norwegian standard ns9415 for example regulating the use of structural elements of fish cages and farms acknowledge an effect of the accumulation of biofouling on hydrodynamic loads acting on the net cages but fail to describe the effect of biofouling in detail standard norge 2009 gansel et al 2015 thus it is essential to conduct researches into the hydrodynamic characteristics of the net cage in currents and waves considering the effect of biofouling there are many different kinds of biofouling organisms which is primarily depending on location and season related to marine aquaculture the physical and geometrical characteristics as well as the distribution of various types of biofouling have different effects on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the net cage it is an urgent need to quantify the effect of biofouling organisms with various physical and geometrical characteristics on hydrodynamics of aquaculture nets as a start this study aims to characterize the drag effects and flow through the plane nets with different levels of hydroid which is the dominating fouling organism on fish farms in the yellow sea of china which is expected to contribute to a better understanding of structural design and risk analysis of aquaculture net cages in the open sea 2 material and methods field sampling was firstly carried out to obtain the plane nets with various levels of biofouling then laboratory experiments were conducted to study the hydrodynamic characteristics of biofouled nets in currents a load cell was used to measure the forces on the plane nets with various levels of biofouling the flow velocities around the plane nets were measured using an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv as the adv can only monitor the flow velocities of some scattered positions a numerical model was introduced to simulate the flow fields around the biofouled nets as an effective supplement 2 1 field sampling the net used in this study was a 0 4 m 0 4 m knotted polyamide net with 16 and 11 meshes in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively the twine diameter was 1 6 mm and the length of mesh bar was 20 6 mm see fig 2 mounted as diamond meshes the net solidity ratio is 0 151 calculated using the empirical formulae bi et al 2013 in order to suppress net deformation the plane net was stretched on a square steel frame with a 6 mm diameter to obtain the accumulation of biofouling at various depths a plane net assembly was designed comprising three plane nets with a center to center distance of 1 m between two adjacent plane nets see fig 2 the top of the plane net assembly was fixed to a floating platform at a fish farm located near guanglu island dalian china three plane net assemblies 9 plane nets in total were prepared to be deployed the first plane net assembly was deployed on 25 july 2016 the other two assemblies were deployed every two weeks in this way different levels of biofouling were expected to be obtained all the plane nets were recovered and transported to the laboratory on 18 october 2016 2 2 laboratory experiment 2 2 1 laboratory set up as indicated by gansel et al 2015 two techniques for drag measurements of the plane net are available i the net is placed in a tank large enough to avoid any wall effects and ii the net spans almost the entire cross section of the tank in this study the biofouled plane net should be treated as a part of the whole net chamber of the net cage therefore the second technique was chosen with little spacing approximately 25 mm between a plane net and tank walls thus assuring almost all water to be pressed through the net the laboratory experiments were conducted in a two dimensional wave current tank at the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering slcoe dalian university of technology dalian china the tank is 22 m long 0 45 m wide and 0 6 m deep the water depth was 0 45 m during this experiment both the bottom and side walls of the tank are made of smooth glass with negligible frictional drag both clean and biofouled plane nets were tested in the tank the plane nets were mounted with four symmetric equi length bridle lines which were attached to a load cell upstream of the net see fig 3 two vertical bridle lines were arranged to maintain the plane net at a constant depth without imparting a horizontal force the load cell was fixed by a vertical rod with a diameter of 10 mm see fig 3 the horizontal distance between the rod and the plane net was 0 6 m and thus the rod had no effect on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the plane net 2 2 2 experimental conditions current velocity was measured using an adv at different locations both upstream and downstream the plane net the velocity measured by the adv was the x component u of the flow velocity the sampling rate was 50 hz with a specified accuracy of 1 mm s the experiments were performed with five different incoming velocities u 0 0 058 0 117 0 171 0 216 and 0 254 m s measurements of flow velocity were also performed with the empty frame the results indicated that the frame has no obvious influence on the flow velocity around the plane net a water resistant load cell with capacity of 15 n was used to measure the drag force acting on the plane net the specified accuracy of the load cell is 0 1 n in the experiment drag forces acting on clean and biofouled plane nets as well as the empty frame were measured each measurement was run three times to diminish the impact of random and bias errors data sampling was conducted over a period of 30 s the final experimental data is the average value of the three measurements 2 2 3 data analysis method drag force acting on the plane net can be expressed as a dimensionless drag coefficient c d 1 c d 2 f d ρ a u 2 where f d is the drag force ρ is the water density u is the flow velocity and a is the effective area in this study drag coefficient is calculated based on both the outline area of a plane net a outline and projection area of the solid part a projection the drag force acting on the clean or the biofouled net was obtained by subtracting the averaged measurements on the square frame from the averaged measurements on the whole plane net model for each flow velocity the drag coefficient of a plane net can be calculated using eq 1 however there is slight discrepancy between the results of c d for discrete flow velocities thus the least squares method was adopted to evaluate the drag coefficient of a plane net for the studied range of flow velocities to quantitatively study the porosity of the net with without biofouling the net solidity s n is defined as the ratio between the projection area and the outline area of the plane net both the clean and biofouled nets were photographed from the front view with white background then the color photos were processed into black and white binary pictures where the net and or the biofouling was shown in black pixels see fig 4 solidity was then calculated as number of black pixels divided by total number of pixels before the hydrodynamic experiment weight measurements for both the clean and biofouled plane nets were conducted the mass of the biofouling was determined by the difference in weight between a biofouled and the clean plane net the volume of both the clean and biofouled plane nets were measured using the archimedes drainage method the total volume of the biofouling on a plane net was yielded by subtracting the volume of the clean plane net from a biofouled plane net 2 3 numerical model for flow field a numerical model based on the navier stokes equations combined with the realizable k ε model is built to solve the flow field around a plane net this model has been described in details including uncertainty analysis of grid refinement time step size number of iterations etc in our previous studies bi et al 2014 2015b zhao et al 2013 thus a brief review is given here the governing equations of the numerical model are as follows 2 ρ u i x i 0 3 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i ρ g i x j μ μ t u i x j u j x i s i where t is time μ is the viscosity ρ is the density of water μ t is the eddy viscosity p p 2 3 ρ k where p represents pressure k represents the turbulent kinetic energy u i and u j are the average velocity component respectively g i is the gravity acceleration i j 1 2 3 x y z and s i is an additional item for the description of both clean and biofouled netting the realizable k ε model shih et al 1995 is introduced to close the equations where k equation is 4 ρ k t ρ k u i x i x j μ μ t σ k k x j g k g b ρ ε y m s k and ε equation is given by 5 ρ ε u i x i x j μ μ t σ ε ε x j ρ c 1 s ε ρ c 2 ε 2 k ν ε c 1 ε ε k c 3 ε g b s ε 6 c 1 max 0 43 η η 5 η s k ε s 2 s i j s i j s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i in the equations g k is the turbulent kinetic energy generated by the average velocity gradient g b and y m due to buoyancy and compressibility are not necessary when modeling incompressible fluid with no temperature fluctuations hence g b 0 and y m 0 c 2 c 1ε and c 3ε are constants s is the modulus of the mean rate of strain tensor σ k and σ ε are the turbulent prandtl number and s k and s ε are user defined source terms the model constants are c 1ε 1 44 c 2 1 9 σ k 1 0 and σ ε 1 2 for the realizable k ε turbulence model although biofouling was scattered randomly across the actual nets for simplicity it is assumed here that the biofouling on the netting is distributed homogeneously in this study both the clean and biofouled plane net were simulated using a porous media fluid model the porous media fluid model is a hypothetical model that acts in the same way as the water blocking effect for both clean and biofouled netting by setting the porous coefficients inside the porous media the additional item in the momentum equation is calculated by the following equation 7 s i c i j 1 2 ρ u u where c ij is given by 8 c i j c n 0 0 0 c t 0 0 0 c t where c ij are porous coefficient matrices c n is the normal resistance coefficient and c t is the tangential resistance coefficient the additional item for the momentum equation is zero outside the porous media the corresponding porous coefficients were determined from the hydrodynamic forces on the plane net which are correlated with the features of the biofouled netting bi et al 2015a in this study the normal resistance coefficient c n is calculated as the drag coefficient of the plane net with various levels of biofouling divided by the thickness of the porous media which is 20 mm according to our previous research bi et al 2015b the thickness of the porous media does not obviously affect the numerical results until the thickness is greater than 10 of the width or height of the plane net however an increase in the thickness of the porous media can effectively reduce the number of cells which thus reduces the computational effort greatly although the thickness of the clean net is small biofouled net can reach to several centimeters in thickness therefore the thickness of the porous media is defined as 20 mm for both the clean and biofouled nettings the tangential resistance coefficient c t can be set to 0 as the plane net oriented normal to the current the numerical model was established according to the experimental setup one end of the numerical flume is described by the velocity inlet boundary condition while the other end is described by the outflow boundary condition both the free surface and the solid surfaces are modeled using the wall boundary with no shear stress see fig 5 the governing equations are solved using commercial code ansys fluent 15 0 where the finite volume method fvm is adopted for discretization the pressure interpolation and momentum equation are discretized using second order upwind scheme the iteration of coupling between pressure and velocity uses the simplec semi implicit method for pressure linked equations consistent algorithm 3 results and discussion 3 1 growth of biofouling on nets the nets were primarily fouled by the hydroid eudendrium capillare see fig 1 right which dominates the fouling communities on fish farms in the yellow sea of china in autumn one colony of the hydroid eudendrium capillare consists of one main stem and a number of branches with annuluses the averaged length of the hydroid fouling accumulated on the net is approximately 4 cm for the plane net with the heaviest level of biofouling the solidity of the studied plane nets and the corresponding growth amounts weight w and volume v of biofouling are presented in table 1 as shown in table 1 net n0 is the clean net as a reference nets n1 n4 and n5 are the hydroid fouled nets submerged with 12 weeks duration but at various depths h s 3 2 and 1 m respectively nets n2 n3 and n5 are the hydroid fouled nets submerged at 1 m depth but with various submerged durations t s 8 10 and 12 weeks it is indicated that the level of biofouling on a plane net is significantly positively correlated with submerged duration but negatively correlated with submerged depth according to the present study solidity increased with submerged durations the increment in solidity is approximately 176 for 8 weeks duration n2 268 for 10 weeks duration n3 and 327 for 12 weeks duration n5 compared to the clean net biofouling weight increased with submerged durations the biofouling weights of nets with 10 and 12 weeks durations are 1 7 and 3 8 times more than that of net with 8 weeks duration respectively biofouling volume also increased with submerged durations the biofouling volumes of nets with 10 and 12 weeks durations are 1 8 and 3 6 times more than that of net with 8 weeks duration respectively it is shown that solidity increased with decreasing depth the increment in solidity is approximately 86 for 3 m depth n1 296 for 2 m depth n4 and 327 for 1 m depth n5 compared to the clean net biofouling weight increased with decreasing depth the biofouling weights of nets with 2 m and 1 m depth are 5 4 and 6 1 times more than that of net with 3 m depth respectively biofouling volume increased with decreasing depth the biofouling volumes of nets with 2 m and 1 m depth are 4 1 and 4 7 times more than that of net with 3 m depth respectively as both solidity and growth amount continuously increase it is considered that the level of biofouling on the plane net increases from nets n0 to n5 3 2 drag on the hydroid fouled nets the experimental results of drag force acting on both clean and hydroid fouled nets for various flow velocities are shown in fig 6 overall the drag force acting on the nets increase from n0 to n5 for discrete flow velocities the drag force acting on each plane net increases with increasing flow velocity the plane nets with different levels of biofouling show similar drag velocity dependence to the clean net a velocity squared relationship is fitted to each plane net by minimizing the mean square difference and the corresponding drag coefficient is yielded uncertainty analysis for drag forces on the nets with different levels of biofouling were made through repeatability tests each measurement was run three times during the laboratory experiment and the standard deviation of the drag force is chosen to represent the precision uncertainty in this study for the drag force acting on the clean net the standard deviation ranges from 0 2 to 7 0 for the drag force acting on the hydroid fouled net the standard deviations are 5 8 9 4 for net n1 0 4 10 3 for net n2 2 0 10 1 for net n3 3 4 11 4 for net n4 and 1 7 12 9 for net n5 overall the range of the standard deviations of the drag force are from 0 2 to 12 9 for various studied incoming velocities the standard deviations are at the same level with that of other laboratory experiments given in the literature such as gansel et al 2015 and lader et al 2015 in fluid dynamics the drag coefficient is a dimensionless quantity that is used to quantify the drag or resistance of an object in a fluid environment usually the area used in drag calculations is the projection area balash et al 2009 bi et al 2017 lader et al 2015 tsukrov et al 2011 zhan et al 2006 for nets however the outline area is also used aarsnes et al 1990 gansel et al 2015 patursson 2007 patursson et al 2010 swift et al 2006 drag coefficient based on projection area of a plane net is primarily related to the drag behavior of the net strand or the biofouling while drag coefficient based on outline area is directly related to the drag force acting on a plane net in this study two sets of drag coefficients are presented in table 2 based on different effective areas outline area and projection area of a plane net both sets of the drag coefficient increase from n0 to n5 drag coefficient based on outline area of the plane net with the heaviest level of biofouling is approximately 10 times greater than that of the clean net this indicates that the accumulation of hydroids can lead to over 10 times more hydrodynamic loads on nets however the hydroid accumulates mainly on the net above 3 m depth especially on the net in the surface water therefore the total hydrodynamic load acting on a biofouled net cage should be predicted by depth dependent drag coefficients of the net drag coefficients of the plane nets with different levels of biofouling over the studied range of solidities are shown in fig 7 overall the drag coefficients based on both the outline and the projection area increase with increasing solidity of the hydroid fouled net drag acting on a biofouled plane net mainly consists of the form drag and skin friction as the level of biofouling increases both the form drag and skin friction increase because of increasing projection area and wetted surface respectively therefore increasing solidity produces increasing drag coefficient as the outline area is always larger than the projection area for the plane net with or without biofouling the drag coefficient based on the projection area is progressively greater than that based on the outline area however the discrepancy of the drag coefficient is prone to decrease with increasing solidity considering an extreme situation the mesh openings became completely blocked due to biofouling the solidity of the net will reach to 1 thus the outline area is equal to the projection area and the same drag coefficient will be derived from different reference areas based on the existing data the drag coefficients can be presented by second order polynomial curve fit as a function of solidity the best fit equations are c d 3 0415s n 2 0 0748s n 1 0572 based on the projection area with a coefficient of determination of 0 9818 and c d 4 3283s n 2 0 6937s n 0 2023 based on the outline area with a coefficient of determination of 0 9964 drag coefficients for the nets show similar trends with respect to the weight and volume of biofouling see fig 8 the drag coefficient of hydroid fouled net increases with increasing amount of biofouling compared to that of clean net the results of the drag coefficient based on the outline area appear to be parallel to that based on the projection area of the plane net the second order polynomial fit equations for the drag coefficient as a function of the weight of biofouling are c d 0 00007w 2 0 0223w 1 1054 based on the projection area with a coefficient of determination of 0 9487 and c d 0 00007w 2 0 0245w 0 1236 based on the outline area with a coefficient of determination of 0 9675 the equations for the drag coefficient as a function of the volume of biofouling are c d 0 00002v 2 0 0116v 1 113 based on the projection area with a coefficient of determination of 0 9266 and c d 0 00002v 2 0 0129v 0 1222 based on the outline area with a coefficient of determination of 0 9551 besides the p value for each regression is relative small which indicates a high significance of the regression see table 3 overall both the solidity of the hydroid fouled net and the growth amount weight and volume of the biofouling are correlated with the drag acting the biofouled net for flow through a biofouled net the drag is primarily derived from pressure drop which greatly depends on the projection area therefore the solidity has stronger effect on drag coefficient than the weight and volume of the biofouling in addition the relationship between the drag coefficient and the solidity is more approaching than that of the growth amount according to the corresponding coefficient of determination thus the solidity is recommended to be a reliable index for describing the level of hydroid fouled net with the abovementioned equation between the drag coefficient and the solidity drag coefficients of nets at different submerged depths with various level of hydroids can be obtained in association with the image analysis of the photo of the hydroid fouled net once the drag coefficient of the hydroid fouled net is obtained it is possible to calculated the hydrodynamic behaviors of a net cage in hydroid fouled condition using existing numerical models that predict the hydrodynamics of clean net e g bi et al 2014 chen and christensen 2017 the main advantage of this approach is that it is easy to deploy some plane net assemblies around the net cage in situ and get the accumulation level at different submerged depths or durations thus the hydrodynamic load of a full scale net cage can be estimated by measuring the drag coefficient of some representative samples of the biofouled nets the regression equations in present study are derived based on the experimental data of hydroid fouled nets the hydroid eudendrium capillare is a kind of flexible organism which is prone to deformation and becoming more streamlined in current in this case the projection area of a biofouled net could change with flow velocity however the discrepancy of the projection area in currents is difficult to be quantified in the present study the solidity of the biofouled net refers to the ratio of the solid fraction to the total area independent of the flow velocity the physical and geometrical characteristics of various biofouling organisms may affect skin friction and reynolds number and then lead to difference in hydrodynamic forces thus the effects of different biofouling organisms on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the net should be quantified in future studies swift et al 2006 gansel et al 2015 3 3 flow field around the hydroid fouled nets numerical simulations of flow through the nets with different levels of biofouling were performed in various currents the corresponding porous coefficients for both clean and hydroid fouled nets in the numerical simulations are shown in table 2 both numerical results and experimental data of the flow velocity at 0 8 m equal to twice the length of the plane net downstream from the nets for various solidities and incoming velocities are presented in fig 9 overall the flow velocities differ by 2 2 7 1 between the numerical results and the corresponding experimental data but the difference for most cases is within the confidence interval calculated from standard deviation of the measured flow velocities the standard deviations of all the data of flow velocity are ranging from 0 004 to 0 01 the discrepancies between the numerical and experimental data are primarily due to the following reasons i the distribution of biofouling on the net is random while that is assumed to be homogeneous in the numerical model and ii the frame consisting of four high slender ratio cylinders was not included in the numerical model for computational efficiency which is prone to cause overestimation of the flow velocity when water flows through the clean or hydroid fouled net the flow velocity is attenuated due to the shielding effect see fig 10 the flow velocity downstream from the nets remains lower than the incoming velocity for rather a long distance for the clean net the flow velocity is nearly constant downstream from the net as the level of biofouling increases from nets n1 to n5 the flow velocity is prone to decrease first and then increase with increasing distance from the net which indicates stronger flow recovery mechanisms for heavier hydroid fouled net the minimum dimensionless flow velocities downstream from the nets with different levels of biofouling are presented in fig 11 based on the numerical data a second order polynomial equation of the minimum dimensionless flow velocity is fitted as a function of the solidity of the corresponding biofouled net the best fit equation is u u 0 0 3517s n 2 0 0256s n 0 985 with a satisfactory coefficient of determination of 0 9969 this curve indicates that the minimum flow velocity downstream from the net decreases with the solidity as quadratic function the net with the greatest level of biofouling produces the most serious shielding effect which causes 21 4 reduction in flow velocity according to the numerical results the reduction in flow velocity downstream from the net is dominated by turbulence dissipation and friction generated by both the net thread and the biofouling as well as flow around the plane net which is the main contribution to the flow recovery mechanism the numerical model can be extended to simulate the flow fields inside and around a net cage with various levels of biofouling in this way the hydrodynamic characteristics of a full scale biofouled net cage can be predicted by measuring the drag coefficient of some representative sheets of biofouled nettings which is simple and cost effective 4 conclusions the net cage in the open sea suffers from serious negative effects of biofouling accumulation it is an urgent need to quantify the effect of biofouling organisms with various physical and geometrical characteristics on hydrodynamics of aquaculture nets the hydroid eudendrium capillare was determined as the dominant biofouling accumulated on the netting of fish farms in the yellow sea of china in autumn by field sampling plane nets with various levels of biofouling were obtained by controlling the submerged durations and depths the averaged length of the hydroid fouling accumulated on the net can reach to approximately 4 cm with a submerged duration of 12 weeks the hydroid eudendrium capillare can primarily affects the hydrodynamics of the net within 3 m depth the results indicated that the level of biofouling on a plane net is significantly positively correlated with submerged duration but negatively correlated with submerged depth drag on and flow through the hydroid fouled nets in currents were investigated using laboratory experiment as well as numerical simulation as an supplement for the flow field the solidity of the hydroid fouled net is recommended to be a reliable index for describing the level of hydroid type fouling instead of the weight and volume of biofouling overall drag acting on the net increased with increasing level of biofouling it was found that the accumulation of hydroids can lead to over 10 times more hydrodynamic loads on nets based on the experimental data an empirical equation between the drag coefficient and the solidity of the hydroid fouled net was derived in this way drag coefficients of nets at different submerged depths with various level of hydroids can be obtained in association with the image analysis of the photo of the hydroid fouled net the hydrodynamic load of a full scale net cage in hydroid fouled condition can be estimated by existing numerical models after obtaining the drag coefficient of some representative samples of the biofouled nets flow velocity downstream from the net decreases continuously with increasing level of biofouling a maximum reduction in flow velocity 21 4 was found downstream from the net with the greatest level of biofouling which indicates a significant negative effect on water exchange of the net cage due to the shielding effect the flow velocity downstream from the nets keeps lower than the incoming velocity for rather a long distance a stronger flow recovery mechanism was found downstream from heavier hydroid fouled nets an empirical equation relating to the solidity of and the minimum flow velocity downstream from the hydroid fouled net was obtained based on the numerical data the proposed numerical model has the potential to simulate the flow fields inside and around a full scale net cage considering a depth dependent level of biofouling acknowledgements this work was

23307,biofouling is an inevitable problem in marine aquaculture and it is prone to cause many negative effects on the hydrodynamic behavior of the aquaculture facility in this study the dominant biofouling on the netting of fish farms in the yellow sea of china was determined by field sampling plane nets with various levels of biofouling were obtained by submerging nets at different depths and for different durations drag acting on the biofouled nets in currents were investigated using laboratory experiment the results indicate that drag acting on the net increases with increasing level of biofouling compared to the clean net the accumulation of biofouling can lead to over 10 times more hydrodynamic load on nets flow fields around the biofouled nets were simulated using a porous media fluid model which was validated by corresponding laboratory experiment as the level of biofouling increases the flow velocity downstream from the net decreases continuously the net with the greatest level of biofouling produces the most serious shielding effect with 21 4 reduction in flow velocity using the proposed empirical equations both the drag on and flow velocity downstream from a hydroid fouled net can be predicted keywords aquaculture net biofouling drag coefficient laboratory experiment numerical simulation 1 introduction with the steady growth of world population and the continuous improvement of living standards the demands for high quality seafood continue to grow to fulfill this goal efforts must be paid to modern technology regarding to offshore aquaculture facilities and equipments in the aquaculture industry offshore net cages are becoming prevalent around the world a typical net cage is mainly composed of floating collar net chamber weight system and mooring system similar to other marine structures the infrastructure of the net cage suffers from the effects of biofouling in the open sea see fig 1 biofouling the accumulation of marine organisms is prone to leading to rapid occlusion of the netting mesh braithwaite et al 2007 which may causes the following disadvantages i biofouling communities acting as disease reservoirs can increase disease risk to the farmed fish fitridge et al 2012 ii the hydrodynamic forces acting on the net cage are dramatically increased which increases the risk of structural failure and fatigue damage of the net cage klebert et al 2013 iii the biofouled netting is easily deformed in currents and thus causes negative effect on the effective volume for the farmed fish and iv the attenuation of currents through the net cage is increased which decreases the water exchange and oxygen supply inside the net cage bi et al 2015a in addition the motion responses geometric deformation dynamic forces as well as flow fields regarding to the net cage are important for both design and maintenance of offshore aquaculture facilities thus the investigation on hydrodynamic characteristics of biofouled net has great significance for aquaculture engineering over the past decades a large number of studies have been carried out to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the net structure and the net cage see for example the review by klebert et al 2013 however there is paucity of research into the effects of biofouling on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the net structure or the net cage in the literature swift et al 2006 performed experiments both in a tow tank and in the field to measure the drag forces acting on biofouled plane nets overall drag force increased with both net solidity and volume of biofouling with considerable scatter which was attributed to the different species of the biofouling there are many different kinds of biofouling organisms related to the net cage e g hydroid mussel and algae etc bloecher et al 2013 the physical and geometrical characteristics as well as the distribution of the biofouling take various forms and have different effects on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the net cage thus a separation of biofouling types in future studies was suggested by swift et al 2006 in norway the leading producer of atlantic salmon the hydroid ectopleura larynx dominates biofouling communities on coastal fish farms during the peak of the biofouling season guenther et al 2010 therefore the biofouling of hydroid ectopleura larynx on salmon cage nets has become an important concern for the norwegian finfish industry gansel et al 2012 conducted physical model tests on six cylindrical metal nettings using piv technique to investigate the effect of porosity on the ventilation inside the cages and the vertical transports within the near wake it was found that heavy biofouling of aquacultural netting can lead to internal circulation which may dramatically reduce the ventilation of the fish cage gansel et al 2015 performed experimental study on both clean and fouled plane nets in a flume tank to evaluate the effect of hydroids an important biofouling organism in norwegian aquaculture on the forces acting on nettings the relationship between net solidity and drag force was assessed and a method was proposed to parameterize the effect of biofouling in terms of an increase in net solidity lader et al 2015 performed field tests to investigate the growth characteristics of hydroids that grow on a net and conducted laboratory experiments to study the hydrodynamic drag on the fouled twines using fabricated models of net twines with artificial hydroid fouling finally a curve fit showing the relationship among growth period hydroid length and drag coefficient for different reynolds numbers was made based on the measurements of the drag on twines with three different biofouling levels although much progress has been made to the best of our knowledge the effects of biofouling on the hydrodynamic characteristics of nets have not been studied systematically technical standards taking the norwegian standard ns9415 for example regulating the use of structural elements of fish cages and farms acknowledge an effect of the accumulation of biofouling on hydrodynamic loads acting on the net cages but fail to describe the effect of biofouling in detail standard norge 2009 gansel et al 2015 thus it is essential to conduct researches into the hydrodynamic characteristics of the net cage in currents and waves considering the effect of biofouling there are many different kinds of biofouling organisms which is primarily depending on location and season related to marine aquaculture the physical and geometrical characteristics as well as the distribution of various types of biofouling have different effects on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the net cage it is an urgent need to quantify the effect of biofouling organisms with various physical and geometrical characteristics on hydrodynamics of aquaculture nets as a start this study aims to characterize the drag effects and flow through the plane nets with different levels of hydroid which is the dominating fouling organism on fish farms in the yellow sea of china which is expected to contribute to a better understanding of structural design and risk analysis of aquaculture net cages in the open sea 2 material and methods field sampling was firstly carried out to obtain the plane nets with various levels of biofouling then laboratory experiments were conducted to study the hydrodynamic characteristics of biofouled nets in currents a load cell was used to measure the forces on the plane nets with various levels of biofouling the flow velocities around the plane nets were measured using an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv as the adv can only monitor the flow velocities of some scattered positions a numerical model was introduced to simulate the flow fields around the biofouled nets as an effective supplement 2 1 field sampling the net used in this study was a 0 4 m 0 4 m knotted polyamide net with 16 and 11 meshes in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively the twine diameter was 1 6 mm and the length of mesh bar was 20 6 mm see fig 2 mounted as diamond meshes the net solidity ratio is 0 151 calculated using the empirical formulae bi et al 2013 in order to suppress net deformation the plane net was stretched on a square steel frame with a 6 mm diameter to obtain the accumulation of biofouling at various depths a plane net assembly was designed comprising three plane nets with a center to center distance of 1 m between two adjacent plane nets see fig 2 the top of the plane net assembly was fixed to a floating platform at a fish farm located near guanglu island dalian china three plane net assemblies 9 plane nets in total were prepared to be deployed the first plane net assembly was deployed on 25 july 2016 the other two assemblies were deployed every two weeks in this way different levels of biofouling were expected to be obtained all the plane nets were recovered and transported to the laboratory on 18 october 2016 2 2 laboratory experiment 2 2 1 laboratory set up as indicated by gansel et al 2015 two techniques for drag measurements of the plane net are available i the net is placed in a tank large enough to avoid any wall effects and ii the net spans almost the entire cross section of the tank in this study the biofouled plane net should be treated as a part of the whole net chamber of the net cage therefore the second technique was chosen with little spacing approximately 25 mm between a plane net and tank walls thus assuring almost all water to be pressed through the net the laboratory experiments were conducted in a two dimensional wave current tank at the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering slcoe dalian university of technology dalian china the tank is 22 m long 0 45 m wide and 0 6 m deep the water depth was 0 45 m during this experiment both the bottom and side walls of the tank are made of smooth glass with negligible frictional drag both clean and biofouled plane nets were tested in the tank the plane nets were mounted with four symmetric equi length bridle lines which were attached to a load cell upstream of the net see fig 3 two vertical bridle lines were arranged to maintain the plane net at a constant depth without imparting a horizontal force the load cell was fixed by a vertical rod with a diameter of 10 mm see fig 3 the horizontal distance between the rod and the plane net was 0 6 m and thus the rod had no effect on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the plane net 2 2 2 experimental conditions current velocity was measured using an adv at different locations both upstream and downstream the plane net the velocity measured by the adv was the x component u of the flow velocity the sampling rate was 50 hz with a specified accuracy of 1 mm s the experiments were performed with five different incoming velocities u 0 0 058 0 117 0 171 0 216 and 0 254 m s measurements of flow velocity were also performed with the empty frame the results indicated that the frame has no obvious influence on the flow velocity around the plane net a water resistant load cell with capacity of 15 n was used to measure the drag force acting on the plane net the specified accuracy of the load cell is 0 1 n in the experiment drag forces acting on clean and biofouled plane nets as well as the empty frame were measured each measurement was run three times to diminish the impact of random and bias errors data sampling was conducted over a period of 30 s the final experimental data is the average value of the three measurements 2 2 3 data analysis method drag force acting on the plane net can be expressed as a dimensionless drag coefficient c d 1 c d 2 f d ρ a u 2 where f d is the drag force ρ is the water density u is the flow velocity and a is the effective area in this study drag coefficient is calculated based on both the outline area of a plane net a outline and projection area of the solid part a projection the drag force acting on the clean or the biofouled net was obtained by subtracting the averaged measurements on the square frame from the averaged measurements on the whole plane net model for each flow velocity the drag coefficient of a plane net can be calculated using eq 1 however there is slight discrepancy between the results of c d for discrete flow velocities thus the least squares method was adopted to evaluate the drag coefficient of a plane net for the studied range of flow velocities to quantitatively study the porosity of the net with without biofouling the net solidity s n is defined as the ratio between the projection area and the outline area of the plane net both the clean and biofouled nets were photographed from the front view with white background then the color photos were processed into black and white binary pictures where the net and or the biofouling was shown in black pixels see fig 4 solidity was then calculated as number of black pixels divided by total number of pixels before the hydrodynamic experiment weight measurements for both the clean and biofouled plane nets were conducted the mass of the biofouling was determined by the difference in weight between a biofouled and the clean plane net the volume of both the clean and biofouled plane nets were measured using the archimedes drainage method the total volume of the biofouling on a plane net was yielded by subtracting the volume of the clean plane net from a biofouled plane net 2 3 numerical model for flow field a numerical model based on the navier stokes equations combined with the realizable k ε model is built to solve the flow field around a plane net this model has been described in details including uncertainty analysis of grid refinement time step size number of iterations etc in our previous studies bi et al 2014 2015b zhao et al 2013 thus a brief review is given here the governing equations of the numerical model are as follows 2 ρ u i x i 0 3 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i ρ g i x j μ μ t u i x j u j x i s i where t is time μ is the viscosity ρ is the density of water μ t is the eddy viscosity p p 2 3 ρ k where p represents pressure k represents the turbulent kinetic energy u i and u j are the average velocity component respectively g i is the gravity acceleration i j 1 2 3 x y z and s i is an additional item for the description of both clean and biofouled netting the realizable k ε model shih et al 1995 is introduced to close the equations where k equation is 4 ρ k t ρ k u i x i x j μ μ t σ k k x j g k g b ρ ε y m s k and ε equation is given by 5 ρ ε u i x i x j μ μ t σ ε ε x j ρ c 1 s ε ρ c 2 ε 2 k ν ε c 1 ε ε k c 3 ε g b s ε 6 c 1 max 0 43 η η 5 η s k ε s 2 s i j s i j s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i in the equations g k is the turbulent kinetic energy generated by the average velocity gradient g b and y m due to buoyancy and compressibility are not necessary when modeling incompressible fluid with no temperature fluctuations hence g b 0 and y m 0 c 2 c 1ε and c 3ε are constants s is the modulus of the mean rate of strain tensor σ k and σ ε are the turbulent prandtl number and s k and s ε are user defined source terms the model constants are c 1ε 1 44 c 2 1 9 σ k 1 0 and σ ε 1 2 for the realizable k ε turbulence model although biofouling was scattered randomly across the actual nets for simplicity it is assumed here that the biofouling on the netting is distributed homogeneously in this study both the clean and biofouled plane net were simulated using a porous media fluid model the porous media fluid model is a hypothetical model that acts in the same way as the water blocking effect for both clean and biofouled netting by setting the porous coefficients inside the porous media the additional item in the momentum equation is calculated by the following equation 7 s i c i j 1 2 ρ u u where c ij is given by 8 c i j c n 0 0 0 c t 0 0 0 c t where c ij are porous coefficient matrices c n is the normal resistance coefficient and c t is the tangential resistance coefficient the additional item for the momentum equation is zero outside the porous media the corresponding porous coefficients were determined from the hydrodynamic forces on the plane net which are correlated with the features of the biofouled netting bi et al 2015a in this study the normal resistance coefficient c n is calculated as the drag coefficient of the plane net with various levels of biofouling divided by the thickness of the porous media which is 20 mm according to our previous research bi et al 2015b the thickness of the porous media does not obviously affect the numerical results until the thickness is greater than 10 of the width or height of the plane net however an increase in the thickness of the porous media can effectively reduce the number of cells which thus reduces the computational effort greatly although the thickness of the clean net is small biofouled net can reach to several centimeters in thickness therefore the thickness of the porous media is defined as 20 mm for both the clean and biofouled nettings the tangential resistance coefficient c t can be set to 0 as the plane net oriented normal to the current the numerical model was established according to the experimental setup one end of the numerical flume is described by the velocity inlet boundary condition while the other end is described by the outflow boundary condition both the free surface and the solid surfaces are modeled using the wall boundary with no shear stress see fig 5 the governing equations are solved using commercial code ansys fluent 15 0 where the finite volume method fvm is adopted for discretization the pressure interpolation and momentum equation are discretized using second order upwind scheme the iteration of coupling between pressure and velocity uses the simplec semi implicit method for pressure linked equations consistent algorithm 3 results and discussion 3 1 growth of biofouling on nets the nets were primarily fouled by the hydroid eudendrium capillare see fig 1 right which dominates the fouling communities on fish farms in the yellow sea of china in autumn one colony of the hydroid eudendrium capillare consists of one main stem and a number of branches with annuluses the averaged length of the hydroid fouling accumulated on the net is approximately 4 cm for the plane net with the heaviest level of biofouling the solidity of the studied plane nets and the corresponding growth amounts weight w and volume v of biofouling are presented in table 1 as shown in table 1 net n0 is the clean net as a reference nets n1 n4 and n5 are the hydroid fouled nets submerged with 12 weeks duration but at various depths h s 3 2 and 1 m respectively nets n2 n3 and n5 are the hydroid fouled nets submerged at 1 m depth but with various submerged durations t s 8 10 and 12 weeks it is indicated that the level of biofouling on a plane net is significantly positively correlated with submerged duration but negatively correlated with submerged depth according to the present study solidity increased with submerged durations the increment in solidity is approximately 176 for 8 weeks duration n2 268 for 10 weeks duration n3 and 327 for 12 weeks duration n5 compared to the clean net biofouling weight increased with submerged durations the biofouling weights of nets with 10 and 12 weeks durations are 1 7 and 3 8 times more than that of net with 8 weeks duration respectively biofouling volume also increased with submerged durations the biofouling volumes of nets with 10 and 12 weeks durations are 1 8 and 3 6 times more than that of net with 8 weeks duration respectively it is shown that solidity increased with decreasing depth the increment in solidity is approximately 86 for 3 m depth n1 296 for 2 m depth n4 and 327 for 1 m depth n5 compared to the clean net biofouling weight increased with decreasing depth the biofouling weights of nets with 2 m and 1 m depth are 5 4 and 6 1 times more than that of net with 3 m depth respectively biofouling volume increased with decreasing depth the biofouling volumes of nets with 2 m and 1 m depth are 4 1 and 4 7 times more than that of net with 3 m depth respectively as both solidity and growth amount continuously increase it is considered that the level of biofouling on the plane net increases from nets n0 to n5 3 2 drag on the hydroid fouled nets the experimental results of drag force acting on both clean and hydroid fouled nets for various flow velocities are shown in fig 6 overall the drag force acting on the nets increase from n0 to n5 for discrete flow velocities the drag force acting on each plane net increases with increasing flow velocity the plane nets with different levels of biofouling show similar drag velocity dependence to the clean net a velocity squared relationship is fitted to each plane net by minimizing the mean square difference and the corresponding drag coefficient is yielded uncertainty analysis for drag forces on the nets with different levels of biofouling were made through repeatability tests each measurement was run three times during the laboratory experiment and the standard deviation of the drag force is chosen to represent the precision uncertainty in this study for the drag force acting on the clean net the standard deviation ranges from 0 2 to 7 0 for the drag force acting on the hydroid fouled net the standard deviations are 5 8 9 4 for net n1 0 4 10 3 for net n2 2 0 10 1 for net n3 3 4 11 4 for net n4 and 1 7 12 9 for net n5 overall the range of the standard deviations of the drag force are from 0 2 to 12 9 for various studied incoming velocities the standard deviations are at the same level with that of other laboratory experiments given in the literature such as gansel et al 2015 and lader et al 2015 in fluid dynamics the drag coefficient is a dimensionless quantity that is used to quantify the drag or resistance of an object in a fluid environment usually the area used in drag calculations is the projection area balash et al 2009 bi et al 2017 lader et al 2015 tsukrov et al 2011 zhan et al 2006 for nets however the outline area is also used aarsnes et al 1990 gansel et al 2015 patursson 2007 patursson et al 2010 swift et al 2006 drag coefficient based on projection area of a plane net is primarily related to the drag behavior of the net strand or the biofouling while drag coefficient based on outline area is directly related to the drag force acting on a plane net in this study two sets of drag coefficients are presented in table 2 based on different effective areas outline area and projection area of a plane net both sets of the drag coefficient increase from n0 to n5 drag coefficient based on outline area of the plane net with the heaviest level of biofouling is approximately 10 times greater than that of the clean net this indicates that the accumulation of hydroids can lead to over 10 times more hydrodynamic loads on nets however the hydroid accumulates mainly on the net above 3 m depth especially on the net in the surface water therefore the total hydrodynamic load acting on a biofouled net cage should be predicted by depth dependent drag coefficients of the net drag coefficients of the plane nets with different levels of biofouling over the studied range of solidities are shown in fig 7 overall the drag coefficients based on both the outline and the projection area increase with increasing solidity of the hydroid fouled net drag acting on a biofouled plane net mainly consists of the form drag and skin friction as the level of biofouling increases both the form drag and skin friction increase because of increasing projection area and wetted surface respectively therefore increasing solidity produces increasing drag coefficient as the outline area is always larger than the projection area for the plane net with or without biofouling the drag coefficient based on the projection area is progressively greater than that based on the outline area however the discrepancy of the drag coefficient is prone to decrease with increasing solidity considering an extreme situation the mesh openings became completely blocked due to biofouling the solidity of the net will reach to 1 thus the outline area is equal to the projection area and the same drag coefficient will be derived from different reference areas based on the existing data the drag coefficients can be presented by second order polynomial curve fit as a function of solidity the best fit equations are c d 3 0415s n 2 0 0748s n 1 0572 based on the projection area with a coefficient of determination of 0 9818 and c d 4 3283s n 2 0 6937s n 0 2023 based on the outline area with a coefficient of determination of 0 9964 drag coefficients for the nets show similar trends with respect to the weight and volume of biofouling see fig 8 the drag coefficient of hydroid fouled net increases with increasing amount of biofouling compared to that of clean net the results of the drag coefficient based on the outline area appear to be parallel to that based on the projection area of the plane net the second order polynomial fit equations for the drag coefficient as a function of the weight of biofouling are c d 0 00007w 2 0 0223w 1 1054 based on the projection area with a coefficient of determination of 0 9487 and c d 0 00007w 2 0 0245w 0 1236 based on the outline area with a coefficient of determination of 0 9675 the equations for the drag coefficient as a function of the volume of biofouling are c d 0 00002v 2 0 0116v 1 113 based on the projection area with a coefficient of determination of 0 9266 and c d 0 00002v 2 0 0129v 0 1222 based on the outline area with a coefficient of determination of 0 9551 besides the p value for each regression is relative small which indicates a high significance of the regression see table 3 overall both the solidity of the hydroid fouled net and the growth amount weight and volume of the biofouling are correlated with the drag acting the biofouled net for flow through a biofouled net the drag is primarily derived from pressure drop which greatly depends on the projection area therefore the solidity has stronger effect on drag coefficient than the weight and volume of the biofouling in addition the relationship between the drag coefficient and the solidity is more approaching than that of the growth amount according to the corresponding coefficient of determination thus the solidity is recommended to be a reliable index for describing the level of hydroid fouled net with the abovementioned equation between the drag coefficient and the solidity drag coefficients of nets at different submerged depths with various level of hydroids can be obtained in association with the image analysis of the photo of the hydroid fouled net once the drag coefficient of the hydroid fouled net is obtained it is possible to calculated the hydrodynamic behaviors of a net cage in hydroid fouled condition using existing numerical models that predict the hydrodynamics of clean net e g bi et al 2014 chen and christensen 2017 the main advantage of this approach is that it is easy to deploy some plane net assemblies around the net cage in situ and get the accumulation level at different submerged depths or durations thus the hydrodynamic load of a full scale net cage can be estimated by measuring the drag coefficient of some representative samples of the biofouled nets the regression equations in present study are derived based on the experimental data of hydroid fouled nets the hydroid eudendrium capillare is a kind of flexible organism which is prone to deformation and becoming more streamlined in current in this case the projection area of a biofouled net could change with flow velocity however the discrepancy of the projection area in currents is difficult to be quantified in the present study the solidity of the biofouled net refers to the ratio of the solid fraction to the total area independent of the flow velocity the physical and geometrical characteristics of various biofouling organisms may affect skin friction and reynolds number and then lead to difference in hydrodynamic forces thus the effects of different biofouling organisms on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the net should be quantified in future studies swift et al 2006 gansel et al 2015 3 3 flow field around the hydroid fouled nets numerical simulations of flow through the nets with different levels of biofouling were performed in various currents the corresponding porous coefficients for both clean and hydroid fouled nets in the numerical simulations are shown in table 2 both numerical results and experimental data of the flow velocity at 0 8 m equal to twice the length of the plane net downstream from the nets for various solidities and incoming velocities are presented in fig 9 overall the flow velocities differ by 2 2 7 1 between the numerical results and the corresponding experimental data but the difference for most cases is within the confidence interval calculated from standard deviation of the measured flow velocities the standard deviations of all the data of flow velocity are ranging from 0 004 to 0 01 the discrepancies between the numerical and experimental data are primarily due to the following reasons i the distribution of biofouling on the net is random while that is assumed to be homogeneous in the numerical model and ii the frame consisting of four high slender ratio cylinders was not included in the numerical model for computational efficiency which is prone to cause overestimation of the flow velocity when water flows through the clean or hydroid fouled net the flow velocity is attenuated due to the shielding effect see fig 10 the flow velocity downstream from the nets remains lower than the incoming velocity for rather a long distance for the clean net the flow velocity is nearly constant downstream from the net as the level of biofouling increases from nets n1 to n5 the flow velocity is prone to decrease first and then increase with increasing distance from the net which indicates stronger flow recovery mechanisms for heavier hydroid fouled net the minimum dimensionless flow velocities downstream from the nets with different levels of biofouling are presented in fig 11 based on the numerical data a second order polynomial equation of the minimum dimensionless flow velocity is fitted as a function of the solidity of the corresponding biofouled net the best fit equation is u u 0 0 3517s n 2 0 0256s n 0 985 with a satisfactory coefficient of determination of 0 9969 this curve indicates that the minimum flow velocity downstream from the net decreases with the solidity as quadratic function the net with the greatest level of biofouling produces the most serious shielding effect which causes 21 4 reduction in flow velocity according to the numerical results the reduction in flow velocity downstream from the net is dominated by turbulence dissipation and friction generated by both the net thread and the biofouling as well as flow around the plane net which is the main contribution to the flow recovery mechanism the numerical model can be extended to simulate the flow fields inside and around a net cage with various levels of biofouling in this way the hydrodynamic characteristics of a full scale biofouled net cage can be predicted by measuring the drag coefficient of some representative sheets of biofouled nettings which is simple and cost effective 4 conclusions the net cage in the open sea suffers from serious negative effects of biofouling accumulation it is an urgent need to quantify the effect of biofouling organisms with various physical and geometrical characteristics on hydrodynamics of aquaculture nets the hydroid eudendrium capillare was determined as the dominant biofouling accumulated on the netting of fish farms in the yellow sea of china in autumn by field sampling plane nets with various levels of biofouling were obtained by controlling the submerged durations and depths the averaged length of the hydroid fouling accumulated on the net can reach to approximately 4 cm with a submerged duration of 12 weeks the hydroid eudendrium capillare can primarily affects the hydrodynamics of the net within 3 m depth the results indicated that the level of biofouling on a plane net is significantly positively correlated with submerged duration but negatively correlated with submerged depth drag on and flow through the hydroid fouled nets in currents were investigated using laboratory experiment as well as numerical simulation as an supplement for the flow field the solidity of the hydroid fouled net is recommended to be a reliable index for describing the level of hydroid type fouling instead of the weight and volume of biofouling overall drag acting on the net increased with increasing level of biofouling it was found that the accumulation of hydroids can lead to over 10 times more hydrodynamic loads on nets based on the experimental data an empirical equation between the drag coefficient and the solidity of the hydroid fouled net was derived in this way drag coefficients of nets at different submerged depths with various level of hydroids can be obtained in association with the image analysis of the photo of the hydroid fouled net the hydrodynamic load of a full scale net cage in hydroid fouled condition can be estimated by existing numerical models after obtaining the drag coefficient of some representative samples of the biofouled nets flow velocity downstream from the net decreases continuously with increasing level of biofouling a maximum reduction in flow velocity 21 4 was found downstream from the net with the greatest level of biofouling which indicates a significant negative effect on water exchange of the net cage due to the shielding effect the flow velocity downstream from the nets keeps lower than the incoming velocity for rather a long distance a stronger flow recovery mechanism was found downstream from heavier hydroid fouled nets an empirical equation relating to the solidity of and the minimum flow velocity downstream from the hydroid fouled net was obtained based on the numerical data the proposed numerical model has the potential to simulate the flow fields inside and around a full scale net cage considering a depth dependent level of biofouling acknowledgements this work was

that takes advantage of existing research in both machine perception as well as accelerated and parallelizable computing is crucial the following criteria are of importance when generating guidelines for extracting a set of sonar features used for underwater navigation feature symmetry symmetric features are generally preferred as their appearance is agnostic to the viewing angle i e the auv s path or heading relative to the feature feature diversity size overall robustness for feature matching between the in situ and the reference map is generally increased if multiple classes of features are used i e features of different types and or sizes feature correlation is then carried out within each class while subsequent feature matching is executed coherently over all classes kernel separability the required computational bandwidth for any 2d convolution operation necessary for feature extraction can be significantly decreased if separable kernels or convolution filters are used a kernel is separable if the 2d convolution operation can be substituted by two successive 1d convolution operations zero mean kernel a zero mean kernel will be agnostic to the actual ambient intensity of the sonar image while still extracting local areas of low high intensity and or intensity gradients given the wealth of available image processing tools gonzales and woods 2002 many kernels may be utilized that meet the criteria listed above however for the sake of initial algorithm deployment and validation a simple 2d gaussian kernel with an offset parameter was chosen over a normalized 2d domain with x k y k 1 1 we select a kernel of the form 1 k n x k y k exp x k 2 y k 2 σ 2 γ 0 with standard deviation σ 0 5 and offset parameter γ 0 chosen to ensure a zero mean filter i e 2 0 1 1 k n x k y k d x k d y k it can be shown that any 2d convolution using k n x k y k can be separated using the two 1d kernels 3 k x x k exp x k 2 σ 2 a n d k y y k exp y k 2 σ 2 such that for any image i we find the convolution response 4 i k n x k y k i k y t y k k x x k γ 0 i 1 y t y k 1 x x k where denotes the convolution operator here 1 y t y k and 1 x x k are all ones tensor of dimensions equal to those of k y t y k and k x x k respectively note that due to the zero mean requirement and the addition of the γ 0 parameter in 1 the 2d convolution is broken down into four 1d convolutions in 4 the separation of k n x k y k is illustrated in fig 1 omitting 1 x x k and 1 y t y k for a kernel size n k computational requirements reduce from n k 2 to 4 n k multiplications per pixel in the output image using matlab s conv2 function for an image size of 1000 1000 and a kernel size of 100 100 the time to execute the 2d convolution was reduced from 830ms to 61ms when separating the kernel as shown in 4 in addition both terms on the right hand side in 4 may be executed in parallel thereby saving computational time note that the kernel 1 can be scaled in order to extract salient features of different physical sizes within the sonar imagery therefore the individual domains for x k and y k will be discretized and subdivided into the appropriate number of bins to match the resolution of the sonar image and to provide desired physical dimension in lateral across track and longitudinal along track direction given the specification of the uuv 3500 sonar unit l3v 3500 side scan ba used in this study across track lateral resolution is 2 4 cm per pixel thus the domain for y k will have to be subdivided into approximately 42 bins to yield a physical kernel dimension of 1m laterally similarly given the update rate of 20hz or 50ms between consecutive pings the along track longitudinal resolution is 50 m s v 0 per pixel where v 0 is the vehicle speed assuming a cruise speed of roughly 2 5knots or 1 3 m s one finds an along track resolution of approximately 6 5 cm per pixel therefore only 15 bins are needed for the x k domain to yield physical kernel dimension of 1m longitudinally for the research presented in this paper three physical kernel dimensions 0 5m 1m and 2m have been chosen and the corresponding 2d kernels are denoted 5 k 0 5 k 1 a n d k 2 resulting kernel sizes measured in actual sonar pixels are listed in table 1 below clearly the number of kernels and kernel sizes used for feature extraction dictates the computational requirements for onboard processing and thus presents a design tradeoff between execution time and feature diversity although convolution responses for all kernels can be computed in parallel the achievable minimal execution time is still governed by the largest kernel 2 2 map generation the uuv 3500 sonar unit used for experimentation and algorithm validation provides two images which are generated using low frequency lf and high frequency hf pings respectively l3v 3500 side scan ba both images represented as i l f and i h f are equal in size with 5000 pixels laterally full swath and 20 t pixels longitudinally where t denotes the time window in seconds over which the image was generated using the kernels or convolution filters outlined in the previous section filter responses 6 γ ϕ i i ϕ k i are obtained for any combination of sonar image type identified by the subscript ϕ l f h f and kernel size identified by the subscript i 0 5 1 2 note that the convolution operations in 6 are carried out using the kernel separation from 4 in the following analysis a feature map ℳ is defined as a collection of individual features f k i e ℳ f 1 f 2 f n where n denotes the number of features contained in the map the definition of individual features is driven by the number of attributes needed to fully describe specific feature classes for this work the following sextuple representation was used 7 f k ϕ k i k ψ k r s k χ k r i k the individual feature attributes denote type of sonar image ϕ k l f h f either low frequency lf or high frequency hf from which the feature was extracted size of convolution kernel i k 0 5 1 2 used to generate convolution response 6 from which the feature was extracted type of feature ψ k l i h i either low intensity li or high intensity hi indicating lower or upper thresholding parameter for feature extraction feature location in sonar image r s k ℝ 2 feature intensity χ k ℝ i e the filter response at pixel location r s k feature location in inertial ned frame r i k ℝ 3 using the convolution responses from 6 low intensity features ψ k l i are extracted at pixel location r s k if 8 χ k p λ γ ϕ k i k where p λ γ ϕ k i k represents the λ th percentile of the convolution response intensity similarly high intensity features ψ k h i are extracted at pixel location r s k if 9 χ k p 100 λ γ ϕ k i k here the parameter λ is a design parameter that offers a tradeoff between a extracting a large number of features thereby generating a high fidelity map and b extracting few highly salient features that define a sparse map during experimentation λ 10 3 was chosen such that over the period of 1 s one li and one hi feature would be extracted on average for each of the three convolution filters from 5 and each of the two types of sonar images note that 1 s of sonar imagery generates two 5000 20 images regardless of vehicle speed using the following two step procedures feature locations are mapped from the sonar image frame r s k into the inertial or ned frame r i k using auv attitude information and position information first the feature location is described in the auv s body frame by r b k ℝ 3 as well as the time instance t k ℝ at which the feature was extracted the value for t k can be inferred from the longitudinal coordinate of the feature in the sonar image and corresponds to the time instance when the vehicle passed the features neither r b k nor t k are feature attributes 7 as they are only used for this intermediate transformation step using a well justified near zero roll assumption and flat sea floor assumption which is generally imposed whenever no a priori topographical information about the sea floor is available rubasingam et al 2011 we find 10 r b k 0 κ ρ 2 h t k 2 h t k here h t k is the auv s height above the sea floor at t k as captured in the auv telemetry data and ρ is the distance to the feature as indicated by its lateral position in the sonar image for a feature on the starboard and port side we find κ 1 and κ 1 respectively for side scan sonar images the longitudinal displacement between the feature and the auv in the auv s body frame i e the first element in r b k is zero second the feature location is mapped into the inertial or ned frame using 11 r i k s t k r i b η t k r b k where s t ℝ 3 represents the auv location η t k is the auv s attitude at t k provided by onboard instrumentation and commonly expressed in euler angles for roll pitch and yaw and r i b indicates the transformation matrix between body and inertial frame see fossen 1994 ned feature locations 11 as part of the feature map ℳ can be derived in two ways first an uncorrected auv location s t k is provided in real time by the onboard navigation filter allowing for the generation of an in situ feature map that is inherently subject to navigation error second the auv location s t k is corrected post dive using gps reference signals effectively eliminating any navigation error clearly the latter is not available during the mission but results in a gps corrected feature map that may later be utilized as reference map for feature matching 2 3 feature matching suppose there are two feature maps one reference map ℳ r and one in situ map ℳ i each map consists of a set of features with attributes as outlined in 7 as discussed in the previous section the reference map is usually generated at prior missions using post dive gps to ground truth the underwater trajectory as well as the feature locations 11 the in situ map is generated in real time onboard the vehicle during subsequent missions collaborative auv navigation is also conceivable in which case a lead vehicle would generate the reference map and share it with follower auvs the objective for the collaborative scenario would be to establish relative localization capabilities with respect to the lead vehicle rather than the inertial frame in order to correlate both maps and to deduce navigational information an existing iterative closest point icp scan matching algorithm besl and mckay 1992a b has been investigated and modified generally icp is an iterative optical flow based algorithm for matching two point sets which has received great interest especially in the areas of image processing and pattern recognition due to its simple yet robust procedure to find the closest point on a geometric entity to a given point icp has been one of the most popular techniques for solving the problem of image registration and subsequent feature matching since the algorithm minimizes the net distance between two point clouds it can effectively handle both 2d and 3d data therefore icp can match any two consecutively scanned sets of points here maps each of which may be represented by a combination of arbitrary shapes such as lines curvatures or single pixels that capture the underlying seafloor bathymetry icp scan matching is an alternating process and consists of two steps a matching step and a transformation step during the matching step any feature f i ℳ i in the input map is paired with a feature f j ℳ r in the reference map using euclidean distance and a nearest neighbor approach to enforce accurate feature type matching icp has been modified for this work such that two features can be paired only if they have the same attributes defined in 7 i e type of sonar image ϕ i ϕ j type of feature ψ i ψ j and size of convolution kernel i i i j for the application at hand icp scan matching points p k are defined as four dimensional 4d vectors containing feature location r i k ℝ 3 as well as feature intensity χ k ℝ both from 7 we find 12 p k r i k t α χ k t ℝ 4 here the parameter α weighs the feature intensity during the matching and transformation step large values of α enforce high intensity matching and relaxed location matching during the transformation step every point p i is projected into the reference frame using an affine transformation i e 13 p ˆ j a p i b r ˆ i j α χ ˆ j a r v v t a χ r i i α χ i b r b χ here the matrix a a t ℝ 4 4 denotes rotation and the vector b ℝ 4 denotes translation then the principal submatrix a r ℝ 3 3 obtained by removing the fourth row and fourth column in a and the first three elements of b denoted here as b r ℝ 3 are the correction terms that contain navigational information in other words the estimated auv underwater trajectory s t can be altered in real time to obtain a corrected position estimate s c t using 14 s c t a r s t b r 3 experimental validation field experiments were carried out at bald eagle state park near state college pa an iver3 auv oceanserver inc 2017 carrying a uuv 3500 high resolution sss unit l3v 3500 side scan ba was used for data collection algorithm validation was then carried out via post processing on day one the auv was tasked to execute a lawn mower trajectory shown in fig 2 below while continuously collecting sss imagery the iver3 auv platform is also shown the trajectory consisted of five dives at a depth of 2 m three in northeasterly direction and two in southwesterly direction gps positioning was acquired for ground truth purposes after each dive individual dives or legs were about 1200m or 3 4 miles long at a speed of roughly 1 3 m s auv flight time per dive is approximately 920s at 20 sonar returns per second each of length 2500 for port and starboard side the two sss images generated for each dive have a dimension of roughly 18400 5000 the acquired auv telemetry data sets were then split into the dead reckoning or uncorrected telemetry and the ground truth or gps corrected telemetry to generate the ground truth trajectory the dead reckoning trajectory was modified i e rotated and stretched such that it aligned with the vehicle s acquired gps position at the resurfacing point the same experiment was repeated on day two effectively yielding overlapping sonar imagery between both days in fig 2 day one and day two trajectories are shown in blue and red respectively a snippet of the collected low frequency sonar imagery i l f is shown in the top plot in fig 3 columns represent individual 1d sonar returns with a swath of about 60 m at the sea floor while intensity of the sonar return is color coded using the log scale the shown sonar imagery snippet consisting of 2000 returns was collected over a period of 100 s while the auv traveled along the positive x axis the middle plot in fig 3 shows the associated convolution response γ l f 1 which is generated for i l f using the convolution kernel k 1 saliency for low and high intensity areas is clearly noticeable separating areas of interest from the background using λ 10 3 in 8 and 9 features are extracted from γ l f 1 generating the feature map ℳ l f 1 the locations of the extracted low and high intensity features are shown in the bottom plot in fig 3 in magenta and black respectively on day one reference feature maps were generated using post dive gps information to correct the auv s trajectory as well as extracted feature locations on day two new in situ feature maps were generated using inertial navigation only i e without the aid of gps post dive correction samples of resulting feature maps for dive 2 are illustrated in fig 4 showing the reference feature map in magenta and the in situ feature map in blue note that for the sake of illustration there is no visual distinction between individual feature types and sizes in fig 4 icp scan matching was performed to correlate feature locations between day one and day two and the estimated affine coordinate transformation 13 was used to update the day two underwater trajectory as defined in 14 transformed features as well as the corrected day two trajectory are shown in black in fig 4 it becomes clear that the algorithm robustly corrects the location of features as well as the location of the auv via feature matching overall navigation accuracy improved from 30 96m or 2 46 percent of distance traveled dt to 14 54m or 1 15 dt resulting navigation accuracies when using the feature maps for all five dives are presented in table 2 although software optimization is beyond the scope of this paper initial bench tests have been conducted to evaluate the overall computation bandwidth required for feature extraction for the application at hand there clearly exists a tradeoff between the number and fidelity of kernels used for feature extraction and the required computational bandwidth preliminary results indicate that for the test case presented in this paper which assumes two 18400 5000 sonar images lf and hf and three kernels see table 1 feature extraction can be accomplished sequentially in just 45 s when using the 1d kernel separation 4 using a 1 8 ghz processing chip given a flight time of 920 s per leg there appears to be sufficient margin to allow for real time operation additional computational savings may be achieved through parallelization and or the usage of graphical processing units gpus 4 conclusion and future work this paper presented the development and experimental validation of a side scan sonar based self localization algorithm for auvs it was shown that multimodal feature extraction yields diverse feature maps that lend themselves to robust feature matching robust and highly accurate underwater navigation was established by incorporating several feature types for correlation feature matching was carried out in 4d and included feature intensity in addition to actual feature location the algorithm was validated using real world sonar imagery collected onboard an iver3 auv navigation accuracy claims were verified with an average navigation accuracy improvement of 66 as compared to pure inertial navigation see table 2 clearly additional field trials are needed to expose the algorithm to different underwater scenes and to fully vet the technology using multiple seabed maps future work will include investigations into the algorithm s susceptibility toward vehicle orientation with respect to the feature map of particular interest are scenarios in which reference map and in situ map are generated at different auv heading angles in addition collaborate aspects of the navigation framework will be explored which may include map sharing and augmentation scenarios acknowledgment this work has been supported by

intensity of the sonar image while still extracting local areas of low high intensity and or intensity gradients given the wealth of available image processing tools gonzales and woods 2002 many kernels may be utilized that meet the criteria listed above however for the sake of initial algorithm deployment and validation a simple 2d gaussian kernel with an offset parameter was chosen over a normalized 2d domain with x k y k 1 1 we select a kernel of the form 1 k n x k y k exp x k 2 y k 2 σ 2 γ 0 with standard deviation σ 0 5 and offset parameter γ 0 chosen to ensure a zero mean filter i e 2 0 1 1 k n x k y k d x k d y k it can be shown that any 2d convolution using k n x k y k can be separated using the two 1d kernels 3 k x x k exp x k 2 σ 2 a n d k y y k exp y k 2 σ 2 such that for any image i we find the convolution response 4 i k n x k y k i k y t y k k x x k γ 0 i 1 y t y k 1 x x k where denotes the convolution operator here 1 y t y k and 1 x x k are all ones tensor of dimensions equal to those of k y t y k and k x x k respectively note that due to the zero mean requirement and the addition of the γ 0 parameter in 1 the 2d convolution is broken down into four 1d convolutions in 4 the separation of k n x k y k is illustrated in fig 1 omitting 1 x x k and 1 y t y k for a kernel size n k computational requirements reduce from n k 2 to 4 n k multiplications per pixel in the output image using matlab s conv2 function for an image size of 1000 1000 and a kernel size of 100 100 the time to execute the 2d convolution was reduced from 830ms to 61ms when separating the kernel as shown in 4 in addition both terms on the right hand side in 4 may be executed in parallel thereby saving computational time note that the kernel 1 can be scaled in order to extract salient features of different physical sizes within the sonar imagery therefore the individual domains for x k and y k will be discretized and subdivided into the appropriate number of bins to match the resolution of the sonar image and to provide desired physical dimension in lateral across track and longitudinal along track direction given the specification of the uuv 3500 sonar unit l3v 3500 side scan ba used in this study across track lateral resolution is 2 4 cm per pixel thus the domain for y k will have to be subdivided into approximately 42 bins to yield a physical kernel dimension of 1m laterally similarly given the update rate of 20hz or 50ms between consecutive pings the along track longitudinal resolution is 50 m s v 0 per pixel where v 0 is the vehicle speed assuming a cruise speed of roughly 2 5knots or 1 3 m s one finds an along track resolution of approximately 6 5 cm per pixel therefore only 15 bins are needed for the x k domain to yield physical kernel dimension of 1m longitudinally for the research presented in this paper three physical kernel dimensions 0 5m 1m and 2m have been chosen and the corresponding 2d kernels are denoted 5 k 0 5 k 1 a n d k 2 resulting kernel sizes measured in actual sonar pixels are listed in table 1 below clearly the number of kernels and kernel sizes used for feature extraction dictates the computational requirements for onboard processing and thus presents a design tradeoff between execution time and feature diversity although convolution responses for all kernels can be computed in parallel the achievable minimal execution time is still governed by the largest kernel 2 2 map generation the uuv 3500 sonar unit used for experimentation and algorithm validation provides two images which are generated using low frequency lf and high frequency hf pings respectively l3v 3500 side scan ba both images represented as i l f and i h f are equal in size with 5000 pixels laterally full swath and 20 t pixels longitudinally where t denotes the time window in seconds over which the image was generated using the kernels or convolution filters outlined in the previous section filter responses 6 γ ϕ i i ϕ k i are obtained for any combination of sonar image type identified by the subscript ϕ l f h f and kernel size identified by the subscript i 0 5 1 2 note that the convolution operations in 6 are carried out using the kernel separation from 4 in the following analysis a feature map ℳ is defined as a collection of individual features f k i e ℳ f 1 f 2 f n where n denotes the number of features contained in the map the definition of individual features is driven by the number of attributes needed to fully describe specific feature classes for this work the following sextuple representation was used 7 f k ϕ k i k ψ k r s k χ k r i k the individual feature attributes denote type of sonar image ϕ k l f h f either low frequency lf or high frequency hf from which the feature was extracted size of convolution kernel i k 0 5 1 2 used to generate convolution response 6 from which the feature was extracted type of feature ψ k l i h i either low intensity li or high intensity hi indicating lower or upper thresholding parameter for feature extraction feature location in sonar image r s k ℝ 2 feature intensity χ k ℝ i e the filter response at pixel location r s k feature location in inertial ned frame r i k ℝ 3 using the convolution responses from 6 low intensity features ψ k l i are extracted at pixel location r s k if 8 χ k p λ γ ϕ k i k where p λ γ ϕ k i k represents the λ th percentile of the convolution response intensity similarly high intensity features ψ k h i are extracted at pixel location r s k if 9 χ k p 100 λ γ ϕ k i k here the parameter λ is a design parameter that offers a tradeoff between a extracting a large number of features thereby generating a high fidelity map and b extracting few highly salient features that define a sparse map during experimentation λ 10 3 was chosen such that over the period of 1 s one li and one hi feature would be extracted on average for each of the three convolution filters from 5 and each of the two types of sonar images note that 1 s of sonar imagery generates two 5000 20 images regardless of vehicle speed using the following two step procedures feature locations are mapped from the sonar image frame r s k into the inertial or ned frame r i k using auv attitude information and position information first the feature location is described in the auv s body frame by r b k ℝ 3 as well as the time instance t k ℝ at which the feature was extracted the value for t k can be inferred from the longitudinal coordinate of the feature in the sonar image and corresponds to the time instance when the vehicle passed the features neither r b k nor t k are feature attributes 7 as they are only used for this intermediate transformation step using a well justified near zero roll assumption and flat sea floor assumption which is generally imposed whenever no a priori topographical information about the sea floor is available rubasingam et al 2011 we find 10 r b k 0 κ ρ 2 h t k 2 h t k here h t k is the auv s height above the sea floor at t k as captured in the auv telemetry data and ρ is the distance to the feature as indicated by its lateral position in the sonar image for a feature on the starboard and port side we find κ 1 and κ 1 respectively for side scan sonar images the longitudinal displacement between the feature and the auv in the auv s body frame i e the first element in r b k is zero second the feature location is mapped into the inertial or ned frame using 11 r i k s t k r i b η t k r b k where s t ℝ 3 represents the auv location η t k is the auv s attitude at t k provided by onboard instrumentation and commonly expressed in euler angles for roll pitch and yaw and r i b indicates the transformation matrix between body and inertial frame see fossen 1994 ned feature locations 11 as part of the feature map ℳ can be derived in two ways first an uncorrected auv location s t k is provided in real time by the onboard navigation filter allowing for the generation of an in situ feature map that is inherently subject to navigation error second the auv location s t k is corrected post dive using gps reference signals effectively eliminating any navigation error clearly the latter is not available during the mission but results in a gps corrected feature map that may later be utilized as reference map for feature matching 2 3 feature matching suppose there are two feature maps one reference map ℳ r and one in situ map ℳ i each map consists of a set of features with attributes as outlined in 7 as discussed in the previous section the reference map is usually generated at prior missions using post dive gps to ground truth the underwater trajectory as well as the feature locations 11 the in situ map is generated in real time onboard the vehicle during subsequent missions collaborative auv navigation is also conceivable in which case a lead vehicle would generate the reference map and share it with follower auvs the objective for the collaborative scenario would be to establish relative localization capabilities with respect to the lead vehicle rather than the inertial frame in order to correlate both maps and to deduce navigational information an existing iterative closest point icp scan matching algorithm besl and mckay 1992a b has been investigated and modified generally icp is an iterative optical flow based algorithm for matching two point sets which has received great interest especially in the areas of image processing and pattern recognition due to its simple yet robust procedure to find the closest point on a geometric entity to a given point icp has been one of the most popular techniques for solving the problem of image registration and subsequent feature matching since the algorithm minimizes the net distance between two point clouds it can effectively handle both 2d and 3d data therefore icp can match any two consecutively scanned sets of points here maps each of which may be represented by a combination of arbitrary shapes such as lines curvatures or single pixels that capture the underlying seafloor bathymetry icp scan matching is an alternating process and consists of two steps a matching step and a transformation step during the matching step any feature f i ℳ i in the input map is paired with a feature f j ℳ r in the reference map using euclidean distance and a nearest neighbor approach to enforce accurate feature type matching icp has been modified for this work such that two features can be paired only if they have the same attributes defined in 7 i e type of sonar image ϕ i ϕ j type of feature ψ i ψ j and size of convolution kernel i i i j for the application at hand icp scan matching points p k are defined as four dimensional 4d vectors containing feature location r i k ℝ 3 as well as feature intensity χ k ℝ both from 7 we find 12 p k r i k t α χ k t ℝ 4 here the parameter α weighs the feature intensity during the matching and transformation step large values of α enforce high intensity matching and relaxed location matching during the transformation step every point p i is projected into the reference frame using an affine transformation i e 13 p ˆ j a p i b r ˆ i j α χ ˆ j a r v v t a χ r i i α χ i b r b χ here the matrix a a t ℝ 4 4 denotes rotation and the vector b ℝ 4 denotes translation then the principal submatrix a r ℝ 3 3 obtained by removing the fourth row and fourth column in a and the first three elements of b denoted here as b r ℝ 3 are the correction terms that contain navigational information in other words the estimated auv underwater trajectory s t can be altered in real time to obtain a corrected position estimate s c t using 14 s c t a r s t b r 3 experimental validation field experiments were carried out at bald eagle state park near state college pa an iver3 auv oceanserver inc 2017 carrying a uuv 3500 high resolution sss unit l3v 3500 side scan ba was used for data collection algorithm validation was then carried out via post processing on day one the auv was tasked to execute a lawn mower trajectory shown in fig 2 below while continuously collecting sss imagery the iver3 auv platform is also shown the trajectory consisted of five dives at a depth of 2 m three in northeasterly direction and two in southwesterly direction gps positioning was acquired for ground truth purposes after each dive individual dives or legs were about 1200m or 3 4 miles long at a speed of roughly 1 3 m s auv flight time per dive is approximately 920s at 20 sonar returns per second each of length 2500 for port and starboard side the two sss images generated for each dive have a dimension of roughly 18400 5000 the acquired auv telemetry data sets were then split into the dead reckoning or uncorrected telemetry and the ground truth or gps corrected telemetry to generate the ground truth trajectory the dead reckoning trajectory was modified i e rotated and stretched such that it aligned with the vehicle s acquired gps position at the resurfacing point the same experiment was repeated on day two effectively yielding overlapping sonar imagery between both days in fig 2 day one and day two trajectories are shown in blue and red respectively a snippet of the collected low frequency sonar imagery i l f is shown in the top plot in fig 3 columns represent individual 1d sonar returns with a swath of about 60 m at the sea floor while intensity of the sonar return is color coded using the log scale the shown sonar imagery snippet consisting of 2000 returns was collected over a period of 100 s while the auv traveled along the positive x axis the middle plot in fig 3 shows the associated convolution response γ l f 1 which is generated for i l f using the convolution kernel k 1 saliency for low and high intensity areas is clearly noticeable separating areas of interest from the background using λ 10 3 in 8 and 9 features are extracted from γ l f 1 generating the feature map ℳ l f 1 the locations of the extracted low and high intensity features are shown in the bottom plot in fig 3 in magenta and black respectively on day one reference feature maps were generated using post dive gps information to correct the auv s trajectory as well as extracted feature locations on day two new in situ feature maps were generated using inertial navigation only i e without the aid of gps post dive correction samples of resulting feature maps for dive 2 are illustrated in fig 4 showing the reference feature map in magenta and the in situ feature map in blue note that for the sake of illustration there is no visual distinction between individual feature types and sizes in fig 4 icp scan matching was performed to correlate feature locations between day one and day two and the estimated affine coordinate transformation 13 was used to update the day two underwater trajectory as defined in 14 transformed features as well as the corrected day two trajectory are shown in black in fig 4 it becomes clear that the algorithm robustly corrects the location of features as well as the location of the auv via feature matching overall navigation accuracy improved from 30 96m or 2 46 percent of distance traveled dt to 14 54m or 1 15 dt resulting navigation accuracies when using the feature maps for all five dives are presented in table 2 although software optimization is beyond the scope of this paper initial bench tests have been conducted to evaluate the overall computation bandwidth required for feature extraction for the application at hand there clearly exists a tradeoff between the number and fidelity of kernels used for feature extraction and the required computational bandwidth preliminary results indicate that for the test case presented in this paper which assumes two 18400 5000 sonar images lf and hf and three kernels see table 1 feature extraction can be accomplished sequentially in just 45 s when using the 1d kernel separation 4 using a 1 8 ghz processing chip given a flight time of 920 s per leg there appears to be sufficient margin to allow for real time operation additional computational savings may be achieved through parallelization and or the usage of graphical processing units gpus 4 conclusion and future work this paper presented the development and experimental validation of a side scan sonar based self localization algorithm for auvs it was shown that multimodal feature extraction yields diverse feature maps that lend themselves to robust feature matching robust and highly accurate underwater navigation was established by incorporating several feature types for correlation feature matching was carried out in 4d and included feature intensity in addition to actual feature location the algorithm was validated using real world sonar imagery collected onboard an iver3 auv navigation accuracy claims were verified with an average navigation accuracy improvement of 66 as compared to pure inertial navigation see table 2 clearly additional field trials are needed to expose the algorithm to different underwater scenes and to fully vet the technology using multiple seabed maps future work will include investigations into the algorithm s susceptibility toward vehicle orientation with respect to the feature map of particular interest are scenarios in which reference map and in situ map are generated at different auv heading angles in addition collaborate aspects of the navigation framework will be explored which may include map sharing and augmentation scenarios acknowledgment this work has been supported by

23309,present research investigates the initial stiffness ultimate strength and failure modes of the x joints reinforced with collar plates under axially tensile load at the first stage a finite element fe model was developed and verified against the test results obtained from an experimental study after that 136 fe models were created and analyzed results showed that the ultimate strength of an x joint reinforced with collar plates can be up to 325 of the strength of the corresponding un reinforced joint furthermore the increase of the collar plate length leads to the remarkable increase of the initial stiffness and ultimate tensile strength also in the same applied load the deformation in the reinforced joints is significantly smaller than the deformation in the corresponding un reinforced joint in spite of remarkable difference between the static strength of the un reinforced and the collar plate reinforced x joints under tensile load no study is available on this topic in addition no design equation is available to determine the ultimate strength of the reinforced x joints subjected to tensile load therefore after the parametric investigation a new theoretical formula

offshore structures such as jack up rigs and jacket type oil platforms are mainly fabricated from circular hollow section chs members also called tubulars high strength light weight fast construction and easy construction are the advantages of these tubular structures ahmadi et al 2015 shao et al 2017 the static strength is one of the most factors affecting the performance of tubular joint in offshore jacket platforms up to now several reinforcing methods have been proposed to increase the static strength of chs joints majority of these methods can only be used for structures during the design e g internal rings joint can internal plates and doubler plates but there are only a few methods which can be used during both design and operation e g collar plates and external plates results of previous studies choo et al 2004a 2005 van der vegte et al 2005 nassiraei et al 2016a 2017a indicated that the collar plate reinforcement method can remarkably increase the static strength of the tubular joints but no research is performed on the static strength of the x joints reinforced with collar plates subjected to brace tensile load furthermore no design equation is currently available for determining the ultimate strength of the collar plate reinforced x joints under tensile load therefore there is an essential requirement for further study so that detailed information and instructions on static evaluation of the collar plate reinforced x joints under tensile load can be formulated in this paper the failure patterns the ultimate strength and the initial stiffness of the chs x joints reinforced with collar plates fig 1 subjected to brace tensile loading are investigated also a new theoretical equation is proposed for determining the ultimate strength of the collar plate reinforced x joints in this research work in the first stage the fe model is validated by the experimental data of six un reinforced and collar plate reinforced x joints carried out by nassiraei et al 2017a after that 138 fe models were generated and analyzed fig 1 in these fe models the welds connecting the collar plates to the chord wall were created in addition the contact between the inner surfaces of the collar plates and the outer surfaces of the chord member was modeled through these fe models the effect of the dimensionless geometrical parameters of the reinforced x joints on the static behavior were investigated finally a new theoretical formula was proposed based on the yield volume model for the prediction of the ultimate strength in the x joints reinforced with collar plates under axially tensile load applicability of the derived formula was validated according to the experimental data 2 literature review following three paragraphs review the research works currently available in the literature regarding the tubular joints reinforced with collar plate tubular x joints and other common reinforcing methods respectively nassiraei et al 2017a experimentally studied the effect of the collar plates on the static strength of the x joints reinforced with collar plate under brace compressive load their results showed that the collar plates have the considerable effect on the static strength choo et al 2004a numerically investigated the effect of the collar plates on the static strength of the x joints under in plane bending ipb load moreover they recommended some equations for determining the ultimate strength choo et al 2005 and van der vegte et al 2005 conducted four experimental tests of the collar plate reinforced t connections under compressive and tensile load nassiraei et al 2016a 2016b and 2016c studied the influence of the joint geometry and the collar plate size on the static performance of t y joints reinforced with collar plates under three different types of loading also they proposed some equations for determining the ultimate strength shao et al 2011 showed that collar plate reinforced t connections can dissipate more energy before failure when they are in cyclic loading compared to the un reinforced ones and therefore they have a more ductile characteristic gao et al 2015 studied the fire resistance performance of the collar plates reinforced tubular t connections cai and shao 2011 and berkhout 2001 showed that the scf values in the collar plate reinforced specimens are smaller than the corresponding values in un reinforced specimens moreover feng et al 2017 studied the influence of the collar plate on the static strength of shs t joints in brace compression qu et al 2017 indicated that the collar plate has positive effect on the dynamic behavior of chs t connections choo et al 2004b numerically studied the effect of the doubler plate on the static strength of the x joints subjected to ipb loading nassiraei et al 2016d 2016e and 2017b showed that doubler plate improves the failure mechanism of the t y joints zhao et al 2014 and zhu et al 2017a and li et al 2018a experimentally and numerically demonstrated that the external stiffeners can increase ultimate strength and the initial static stiffness of t and x joints in brace compression also they proposed an equation for determining the x joints reinforced with external stiffener under brace compression zhu et al 2016 and 2017b experimentally and numerically studied on the static strength of chs t and x joints reinforced with external stiffening rings wang et al 2016 and li et al 2018b studied the failure mechanisms of the un reinforced tubular joint subjected to different types of loading lesani et al 2014 investigated the static performance of chs t connections with fiber reinforced polymer frp in compression in order to investigate the influence of the chord thickness at the joint intersection yang et al 2012 investigated the static strength of welded circular tubular y connections in compression lee and llewelyn parry 1999 2005 implemented several experimental tests and numerical models on tubular connections reinforced with internal ring stiffeners in conclusion the review shows that despite the remarkable effect of the collar plate on the static strength of the tubular joints no study is available on the static strength of the collar plate reinforced x joints subjected to tensile load also no equation is available for determining the ultimate strength of x joints reinforced with collar plates in tensile load 3 brief summary of previous experiments six x joints were tested by nassiraei et al 2017a to investigate the influence of the collar plates on the static strength three of them were un reinforced joints and the other three were the collar plate reinforced joints the geometrical characteristics and material details of the specimens are listed in tables 1 and 2 all specimens were installed under a loading frame also brace compressive load was applied by a jack fig 2 depicts the general arrangement for the x joint test the position of displacement transducers is shown in fig 2 the data from displacement transducers and a load cell were recorded during the entire loading process the influence induced by residual stresses of welding was not taken in the experiment furthermore the fe models agreed well with experiments data when did not take the residual stresses 4 description of numerical modeling the isotropic plasticity model and von mises failure yield criterion were used in the fe modeling the reinforcing plates chord member and brace members were supposed to have a yield stress of 300 mpa moreover young s modulus e and poisson s ratio ν were taken to be 210 gpa and 0 3 respectively the welds were modeled in the fe simulations the welds joining the collar plates to the chord surface were designed according to american welding society aws 2015 furthermore the mechanical properties of the welds were defined as the material parameters of the brace members the depth of the welds joining the plates to the chord member was considered the same as the collar plate thickness in this study solid 186 element was utilized for meshing the welds collar plates brace members and chord member in both un reinforced and the collar plate reinforced joints the element may show any spatial direction a sub zone mesh generation method was applied in the fe modeling for guaranteeing the mesh quality in this method the whole structure is discrete into several different regions according to the computational complexity the mesh produced by this method in the near of the joint intersection is shown in fig 3 to verify the convergence of fe results convergence test with different values of the mesh densities was implemented before meshing the fe models for the parametric investigation nassiraei et al 2017a in this research the collar plates and the chord member were meshed separately after that the ansys contact ability was applied to define the interaction between the reinforcing plates and chord member nonlinear face to face contact method was applied to define the interaction the augmented lagrange producer was implemented as the contact algorithm for solving this contact issue nassiraei et al 2017a also contact was set to be automatically adjusted to close the gap and reduce the penetration close gap reduce penetration command in ansys the contact was detected on gauss points nassiraei et al 2016b ahmadi 2016 for more information about details of contact modeling researchers can refer to ansys contact guideline swanson analysis systems inc 2009 the ends of the chord member were free the tensile load was applied to the brace end in order to take the advantage of the symmetry in geometry loading and boundary conditions only one eighth of the whole x joints were created during the validation phase and parametric investigation the surfaces on the symmetry planes were set with symmetric boundary conditions a nonlinear static analysis was implemented to investigate the nonlinear static performance of the collar plate reinforced x joints both material and geometric nonlinearities were taken furthermore the arc length procedure is used during the fe modeling the arc length procedure was operated by the arclen command in ansys fe code 5 validation of the fe models in the present study the fe package ansys was utilized to simulate the static behavior of the collar plate reinforced tubular x joints in order to validate the developed fe model the results of six experimental tests were used the six experimental tests were carried out by nassiraei et al 2017a three experimental tests were un reinforced x joints the others were the collar plate reinforced x joints all six x joints were under brace compressive load all the details utilized for simulating the specimens in the validation step are listed in tables 1 and 2 fig 4 depicts the load ovalization curves from tests and fe model the load displacement curves of a1 and a2 show the experimental data and fe results of the un reinforced and the collar plate reinforced joints with β 0 25 the curves of a3 and a4 depict the experimental data and fe results of the un reinforced and the collar plate reinforced connections with β 0 54 the experimental data and fe results of the connections with β 0 73 are shown in curves a5 and a6 the comparison of experimental data and numerical results show that the present fe model can well predict the load ovalization curves initial stiffness the ultimate strength of the un reinforced and the collar plate reinforced x joints the values of the ultimate strength obtained from both experimental and numerical approaches are tabulated in table 3 from the results shown in fig 4 and table 3 it can be concluded that the present developed fe model is capable of simulating the static behavior of the collar plate reinforced and the un reinforced tubular x joints 6 geometrical effects on the initial stiffness static strength and failure patterns 6 1 details of parametric study based on the verified fe models an extensive parametric study was implemented to investigate the effect of the dimensionless geometric parameters of the collar plates and the joint on the ultimate strength initial stiffness and failure patterns in the x joints reinforced with collar plates subjected to axially tensile load 138 fe models based on the collar plate size and connection size parameters were created in ansys software package to study the influence of the collar plates on the ultimate strength initial stiffness and failure mechanisms in the collar plate reinforced x joints under brace tensile load in this study the same as research works conducted by choo et al 2004a 2004b nassiraei et al 2017a zhu et al 2017b and li et al 2018a brace to chord intersection angle is 90 for a more general case researchers can refer to research work conducted by qian 2013 the specific values of the parameters are listed in table 4 the fe models were generated with five different β β 0 2 0 4 0 5 0 6 and 0 8 four different γ γ 10 18 20 and 26 two different τ τ 0 7 and 1 0 four different τ c τ c 1 0 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 and four different η η 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 0 values for determining the ultimate strength in the tubular connections under axial load lu et al 1994 proposed a method they recommended deformation limit equal to 3 d relative to the chord center for x joints 3 d relative to the chord center equals to 6 d relative to the chord bottom in the present paper this method is used for determining the ultimate strength such as research works conducted by choo et al 2005 van der vegte et al 2005 nassiraei et al 2016a 2016b 2016d 2016e 2017a zhu et al 2016 2017a 2017b and li et al 2018a for unreinforced and reinforced tubular joints under compressive and tensile load in addition for connections with a clear peak before the deformation limit the strength value at the peak load was considered as an ultimate strength moreover choo et al 2003 proposed a new approach in the definition of joint strength for thick walled circular hollow section chs x joint subjected to brace axial loading this is based on the plastic load approach also fracture failure is an important failure mode in the determining the ultimate strength of the tubular joints in the present research work the computed static strength does not consider the fracture failure of the material the same as research works conducted on the static strength of t y joints reinforced with collar plates under tensile load nassiraei et al 2016b choo et al 2005 van der vegte et al 2005 and research work carried out on the static capacity of x joints reinforced with collar plates under ipb load choo et al 2004a for more information about this failure mode researchers can refer to the research works conducted by qian et al 2005 gu et al 2016 qian and zhang 2015 6 2 effect of the β on the initial stiffness ultimate strength and failure patterns 12 charts are presented in fig 5 showing the load ovalization curves of the un reinforced and the collar plate reinforced x joints result shows that the initial stiffness in the reinforced connections is remarkably bigger than the initial static stiffness in the corresponding un reinforced connections furthermore the increase of the β in models having fixed value of chord diameter d results in the considerable increase of the initial stiffness in addition the initial stiffness in the joints with bigger collar plate size is bigger these results can be observed in all joints with small intermediate and big values of the β β 0 2 0 5 and 0 8 fig 6 depicts the ultimate strength of the joints comparison of results shows the ultimate strength of the reinforced joints are significantly bigger than the ultimate strength of the corresponding un reinforced joints furthermore the increase of the β leads to significant increase of the ultimate strength in the collar plate reinforced x joints under tensile load because the length of the reinforcing plate is a ratio of the brace diameter hence the increase of the β results in the increase of the brace diameter and collar plate length as a result the increase of the β leads to the increase of the static stiffness hence the increase of the β results in the considerable enhancement of the initial stiffness and ultimate strength in x joints with collar plates furthermore the enhancing effect of the reinforcing plate thickness and the reinforcing plate length on the ultimate strength becomes more considerable when one of these parameters is big fig 7 presents the strength ratios of the collar plate reinforced joints to the corresponding un reinforced joints results show that the increase of the β from 0 2 to 0 5 can lead to significant increase of the strength ratios but the increase of the β from 0 5 to 0 8 cannot result in the significant increase of the strength ratios in fig 7c for the connections with η 0 5 0 75 and 1 0 the strength ratios are significantly bigger than the corresponding strength ratio for the joint with η 0 25 because the un bent collar plate length exceeds half of the surroundings of the chord section for the joints with η 0 5 0 75 and 1 0 in this situation an equivalent complete ring of the bottom and top collar plates forms a more direct and effective load transferring pattern fig 8 shows the deformed shapes of a collar plate reinforced x joint and the corresponding un reinforced x joint the same tensile load value was used for both of the joints results show that deformation of the collar plate reinforced joint is significantly smaller than the deformation of the corresponding un reinforced joint fig 8a and b in fig 8c clear difference can be observed between the deformed shape and un deformed shape of the un reinforced x joints but in fig 8d the deformed shape and the un deformed shape of the collar plate reinforced x joints are very close together hence the collar plate can lead to the significant reduction of the displacement in the x joints under tensile load fig 9 depicts the deformed shapes of two collar plate reinforced x joint with different β values β 0 2 and 0 5 the same tensile load level was applied on the brace end of the two joints comparison fig 10 a and b shows that the deformation of the reinforced joint with small β β 0 2 is significantly bigger than the deformation of the corresponding reinforced joint with intermediate β β 0 5 results show that for the reinforced x joints the increase of the β leads to the decrease of the deformation because the increase of the β leads to the increase of the brace diameter d and collar plate length η the increase of the d and η result in the enhancement of the chord member stiffness in the load direction comparison the results shows that both the collar plate thickness and the collar plate length have remarkable effect on the static behavior of x joints under tensile load results show that the increase of η and τ c results in the increase of the initial stiffness and ultimate strength there are two key reasons 1 the increase of the plate length results in the increase of the region plastic 2 the increase of the plate thickness leads to the increase of the chord wall thickness brace thickness and brae diameter in the vicinity of the brace to chord intersection consequently the increase of the plate size results in the increase of the static stiffness of the chord wall near the joint intersection 6 3 effect of the γ on the initial stiffness ultimate strength and failure patterns fig 10 shows the load ovalization curves of the un reinforced and collar plate reinforced x joints with γ 10 18 and 26 results show that the initial stiffness in the reinforced joints with smaller γ are significantly bigger furthermore the initial stiffness in the reinforced joints is remarkably bigger than the initial stiffness in the corresponding un reinforced joints in addition the increase of the plate thickness and the plate length leads to the increase of the initial stiffness in fig 10k for the joints with γ 10 0 η 1 0 and τ c bigger than 1 25 the increase of the plate thickness cannot result in the increase of the static strength however for the joints with γ 18 and 26 η 1 0 and τ c bigger than 1 25 increase of the plate thickness can considerably lead to the increase of the ultimate strength fig 10k and l the difference among the performance of these reinforced joints is because of failure position for the plate reinforced joints with γ 10 0 η 1 0 and τ c bigger than 1 25 the brace failure occurred before the chord plastification fig 11 a and c on the contrary for the plate reinforced joints with γ 18 and 26 η 1 0 and τ c bigger than 1 25 the joint failure occurred before the brace failure fig 11b and d when the static stiffness of the joint in load direction becomes higher than the static stiffness of the brace wall in load direction the brace failure will be occur before the joint failure in this situation the increase of the collar size cannot be useful consequently for these joint geometries γ 10 0 β 0 6 η 1 0 and τ c bigger than 1 25 the increase of the plate thickness cannot result in the increase of the joint strength for this range of joint geometry it is economically interesting to apply the collar plates with smaller thickness but for the corresponding joints with γ 18 and 26 the increase of the plate thickness even for τ c bigger than 1 25 leads to the significant enhancement of the joint strength because there is no brace failure before joint failure fig 12 shows that the ultimate strength of the collar plate reinforced connections are remarkably bigger than the ultimate strength of the corresponding un reinforced connections this result can be concluded for all joints with small γ ratio say γ 10 intermediate γ ratio say γ 18 and big γ ratio say γ 26 in addition fig 12 show that the decrease of the γ leads to the increase of the ultimate strength in the collar plate reinforced x joints because the thickness of the reinforcing plate is a ratio of the chord wall thickness hence the reduction of the γ leads to the increase of the chord wall thickness and the reinforcing plate thickness consequently the reduction of the γ results in the enhancement of the static stiffness of the reinforced joints near the joint intersection therefore the reduction of the γ leads to the remarkable enhancement of the initial static stiffness and ultimate strength of x joints with collar plates in addition the enhancing influence of the reinforcing plate thickness and reinforcing plate length on the ultimate strength becomes more remarkable when one of these parameters is big fig 13 indicates the strength ratios of the collar plate reinforced connections to the corresponding un reinforced joints results show that the increase of the plate size leads to the increase of the strength ratios fig 13 indicates that the change of the γ for the reinforced connections with η 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 cannot result in the change of the strength ratios but for the reinforced connections with η 1 0 the change of the γ result in the change of the strength ratios because for the reinforced connections with η 1 0 and β 0 6 the un bent reinforcing plate length exceeds half of the surroundings of the chord section therefore an equivalent complete ring of the top and bottom reinforcing plates forms a more powerful load transferring mode for this situation the increase of the γ result in the considerable increase of the strength ratios for instance when the connections are reinforced with η 1 0 and τ c 1 5 the strength ratio for the connections with γ 10 18 and 26 are 2 25 2 8 and 2 95 respectively it can be seen that for the joints with an equivalent complete ring of the top and bottom reinforcing plates the increase of the γ leads to the significant increase of the strength ratios comparison of figs 10 13 shows that both the collar plate length and thickness have remarkable influence on the initial stiffness and ultimate strength result shows that the increase of these parameters leads to the increase of the initial stiffness and ultimate strength fig 14 depicts the equivalent plastic strain and the deformed shapes of a collar plate reinforced x joint and the corresponding un reinforced x joint the same vertical displacement level is applied on the brace end of the joints comparison of equivalent plastic strains in fig 14a and b shows that the use of the collar plate cannot lead to the change of maximum plastic strain position in both the un reinforced and the collar plate reinforced x joints maximum plastic strain occurred the joint intersection near the saddle points however fig 14c and d shows that the use of the plate results in the remarkable reduction of the displacement in the chord center as it can be seen the deformation of the chord center in the reinforced joints fig 14d is significantly smaller than the deformation of the chord center in the corresponding un reinforced joints fig 14c fig 15 shows the deformed shapes of two collar plate reinforced x joint with different γ values γ 18 and 26 the same tensile load value is used for the two joints comparison fig 15a and b depicts that the deformation in the joint with intermediate γ γ 18 is smaller than the corresponding deformation in the joint with big γ γ 26 therefore for the collar plate reinforced x joints the increase of the γ results in the increase of the deformation because the decrease of the γ results in the increase of the chord wall thickness t and the collar plate thickness τ c the increase of the t and the τ c leads to the enhancement of chord member stiffness in the near joint intersection 6 4 effect of the τ on the static performance fig 16 reveals that by increasing the τ from 0 7 to 1 0 the initial stiffness of the un reinforced joints are constant however for the reinforced joints the increase of the τ in models having fixed value of the t results in the small increase of the initial stiffness but the increase of the collar plate length and thickness leads to the remarkable increase of the initial stiffness the same result can be observed for the ultimate strength values in fig 17 furthermore fig 18 depicts that the strength ratios of the connections with τ 1 0 are a little bigger than the corresponding values for the joints with τ 0 7 for instance for the joints reinforced with τ c 1 25 and η 1 0 the strength ratio for the joints with τ 0 7 and 1 0 are 1 70 and 1 81 respectively 6 5 effect of the η and τc on the failure patterns fig 19 shows that the deformed shapes of the un reinforced and the collar plate reinforced x joints along the chord s longitudinal axis fig 19a depicts the deformed shape of the un reinforced joint fig 19b d shows the deformed shapes of the joints with different values of the reinforcing plate thickness τ c and length η for all the un reinforced and the reinforced joints the same tensile load is applied results show the deformation in the collar plate reinforced x joints are significantly smaller than the corresponding un reinforced connections furthermore the increase of the η and τ c leads to the significant reduction of the deformation hence the increase of both η and τ c lead to the increase of the joint strength 7 formulation for static strength of x joints reinforced with collar plates the ultimate strength of the chs connections has been usually derived by the yield line model feng and young 2015 and the ring model van der vegte 1995 for a reinforced tubular joint a modified yield line model has been established by zhu et al 2016 which considered the contribution of stiffeners for estimating the ultimate strength of reinforced circular tubular t connections it was observed that there were only two parameters stiffener wide and ratio of brace diameter to chord diameter related to the ultimate strength ratios but this situation is more arduous for a collar plate reinforced chs x joint four parameters are involved with ultimate strength enhancement coefficient r e including diameter ratio between chord and brace β the ratio of chord radius to chord wall thickness γ the collar plate thickness factor τ c and the collar plate length factor η for this new situation a yield volume model was extended from the modified yield line model recommended by zhu et al 2016 as illustrated in fig 20 in the ultimate load state of un reinforced connections only the intersecting volume between chord and brace v 1 yields is considered but for a collar plate reinforced joint both of the intersecting body between chord and brace v 1 and the body of entire collar plate v 2 yield are considered the calculation diagram is depicted in fig 21 the radius of the chord axial direction of the intersection line is d 2 and the radius of the chord circumferential direction is d 2arcsin β therefore the perimeter p of the intersection line between chord member and brace member can be shown as 1 p π d 2 d 2 arcsin β 2 v 1 p t t 3 sin θ d d β θ arcsin β according to taylor s expansion 4 arcsin β β 1 6 β 3 5 v 1 π 2 d t t

τ c a 4 a 5 a 6 β a 7 a 8 a 9 η a 10 the parameters a 1 a 10 can be calculated through a non linear regression analysis in the software package spss the data imported in spss in the form of a matrix including the values of the dependent variable i e r e and independent variables η τ c β and γ the final formulation can be expressed as 10 r e 1 0 35 β 0 96 γ 0 18 τ c 0 87 1 16 β 16 1 1 99 η 1 34 r 2 0 891 in eq 10 r e is the ultimate strength ratio of the reinforcing plate reinforced to un reinforced x joint under to tensile load r 2 shows the coefficient of determination and its value for the established equation is considered to be acceptable regarding the intricate nature of the problem the valid ranges for the application of eq 10 are as follows 10 γ 26 0 2 β 0 8 1 0 τ c 1 75 0 25 η 1 0 in fig 22 the ultimate strength ratios predicted by the established equation eq 10 are compared with corresponding values extracted from fe analysis it can be observed from fig 22 that there is a good agreement between the values obtained from the derived equation and the values extracted from the fe analysis finally it can be concluded from the value of r 2 r 2 0 891 and fig 22 that the proposed formula can safely be utilized for designing of jacket type platforms and other tubular structures 8 conclusions 138 fe models verified against the experimental data were generated and analyzed to investigate the static behavior of the collar plate reinforced x joints subjected to brace tensile load main conclusions are summarized as follows the ultimate strength of the collar plate reinforced x joints subjected to tensile load can be up to 325 to that of the ultimate strength of the corresponding un reinforced joint subjected to axially tensile load both the collar plate length and the collar plate thickness have remarkable effect on the ultimate strength initial stiffness and failure mechanisms but the increase of the collar plate thickness cannot result in the increase of the static strength for the joints with γ 10 0 β 0 6 η 1 0 and τ c 1 25 in the same applied load the deformation of the reinforced joints is significantly smaller than the deformation of the corresponding un reinforced joint the increase of the β from 0 2 to 0 5 can result in significant enhancement of the strength ratios however the increase of the β from 0 5 to 0 8 cannot lead to the significant enhancement of the strength ratios for the joints with β 0 6 η 1 0 and β 0 8 η 0 5 the use of the collar plates result in the very considerable enhancement of the ultimate strength a theoretical model was derived for determining the ultimate strength of the collar plate reinforced tubular x joints subjected to tensile load high coefficient of determinations obtained for the equation guarantees the accuracy of the formula therefore the derived theoretical equation can reliably be applied to the static design of offshore jacket structures and other tubular structures acknowledgements the authors

23309,present research investigates the initial stiffness ultimate strength and failure modes of the x joints reinforced with collar plates under axially tensile load at the first stage a finite element fe model was developed and verified against the test results obtained from an experimental study after that 136 fe models were created and analyzed results showed that the ultimate strength of an x joint reinforced with collar plates can be up to 325 of the strength of the corresponding un reinforced joint furthermore the increase of the collar plate length leads to the remarkable increase of the initial stiffness and ultimate tensile strength also in the same applied load the deformation in the reinforced joints is significantly smaller than the deformation in the corresponding un reinforced joint in spite of remarkable difference between the static strength of the un reinforced and the collar plate reinforced x joints under tensile load no study is available on this topic in

offshore structures such as jack up rigs and jacket type oil platforms are mainly fabricated from circular hollow section chs members also called tubulars high strength light weight fast construction and easy construction are the advantages of these tubular structures ahmadi et al 2015 shao et al 2017 the static strength is one of the most factors affecting the performance of tubular joint in offshore jacket platforms up to now several reinforcing methods have been proposed to increase the static strength of chs joints majority of these methods can only be used for structures during the design e g internal rings joint can internal plates and doubler plates but there are only a few methods which can be used during both design and operation e g collar plates and external plates results of previous studies choo et al 2004a 2005 van der vegte et al 2005 nassiraei et al 2016a 2017a indicated that the collar plate reinforcement method can remarkably increase the static strength of the tubular joints but no research is performed on the static strength of the x joints reinforced with collar plates subjected to brace tensile load furthermore no design equation is currently available for determining the ultimate strength of the collar plate reinforced x joints under tensile load therefore there is an essential requirement for further study so that detailed information and instructions on static evaluation of the collar plate reinforced x joints under tensile load can be formulated in this paper the failure patterns the ultimate strength and the initial stiffness of the chs x joints reinforced with collar plates fig 1 subjected to brace tensile loading are investigated also a new theoretical equation is proposed for determining the ultimate strength of the collar plate reinforced x joints in this research work in the first stage the fe model is validated by the experimental data of six un reinforced and collar plate reinforced x joints carried out by nassiraei et al 2017a after that 138 fe models were generated and analyzed fig 1 in these fe models the welds connecting the collar plates to the chord wall were created in addition the contact between the inner surfaces of the collar plates and the outer surfaces of the chord member was modeled through these fe models the effect of the dimensionless geometrical parameters of the reinforced x joints on the static behavior were investigated finally a new theoretical formula was proposed based on the yield volume model for the prediction of the ultimate strength in the x joints reinforced with collar plates under axially tensile load applicability of the derived formula was validated according to the experimental data 2 literature review following three paragraphs review the research works currently available in the literature regarding the tubular joints reinforced with collar plate tubular x joints and other common reinforcing methods respectively nassiraei et al 2017a experimentally studied the effect of the collar plates on the static strength of the x joints reinforced with collar plate under brace compressive load their results showed that the collar plates have the considerable effect on the static strength choo et al 2004a numerically investigated the effect of the collar plates on the static strength of the x joints under in plane bending ipb load moreover they recommended some equations for determining the ultimate strength choo et al 2005 and van der vegte et al 2005 conducted four experimental tests of the collar plate reinforced t connections under compressive and tensile load nassiraei et al 2016a 2016b and 2016c studied the influence of the joint geometry and the collar plate size on the static performance of t y joints reinforced with collar plates under three different types of loading also they proposed some equations for determining the ultimate strength shao et al 2011 showed that collar plate reinforced t connections can dissipate more energy before failure when they are in cyclic loading compared to the un reinforced ones and therefore they have a more ductile characteristic gao et al 2015 studied the fire resistance performance of the collar plates reinforced tubular t connections cai and shao 2011 and berkhout 2001 showed that the scf values in the collar plate reinforced specimens are smaller than the corresponding values in un reinforced specimens moreover feng et al 2017 studied the influence of the collar plate on the static strength of shs t joints in brace compression qu et al 2017 indicated that the collar plate has positive effect on the dynamic behavior of chs t connections choo et al 2004b numerically studied the effect of the doubler plate on the static strength of the x joints subjected to ipb loading nassiraei et al 2016d 2016e and 2017b showed that doubler plate improves the failure mechanism of the t y joints zhao et al 2014 and zhu et al 2017a and li et al 2018a experimentally and numerically demonstrated that the external stiffeners can increase ultimate strength and the initial static stiffness of t and x joints in brace compression also they proposed an equation for determining the x joints reinforced with external stiffener under brace compression zhu et al 2016 and 2017b experimentally and numerically studied on the static strength of chs t and x joints reinforced with external stiffening rings wang et al 2016 and li et al 2018b studied the failure mechanisms of the un reinforced tubular joint subjected to different types of loading lesani et al 2014 investigated the static performance of chs t connections with fiber reinforced polymer frp in compression in order to investigate the influence of the chord thickness at the joint intersection yang et al 2012 investigated the static strength of welded circular tubular y connections in compression lee and llewelyn parry 1999 2005 implemented several experimental tests and numerical models on tubular connections reinforced with internal ring stiffeners in conclusion the review shows that despite the remarkable effect of the collar plate on the static strength of the tubular joints no study is available on the static strength of the collar plate reinforced x joints subjected to tensile load also no equation is available for determining the ultimate strength of x joints reinforced with collar plates in tensile load 3 brief summary of previous experiments six x joints were tested by nassiraei et al 2017a to investigate the influence of the collar plates on the static strength three of them were un reinforced joints and the other three were the collar plate reinforced joints the geometrical characteristics and material details of the specimens are listed in tables 1 and 2 all specimens were installed under a loading frame also brace compressive load was applied by a jack fig 2 depicts the general arrangement for the x joint test the position of displacement transducers is shown in fig 2 the data from displacement transducers and a load cell were recorded during the entire loading process the influence induced by residual stresses of welding was not taken in the experiment furthermore the fe models agreed well with experiments data when did not take the residual stresses 4 description of numerical modeling the isotropic plasticity model and von mises failure yield criterion were used in the fe modeling the reinforcing plates chord member and brace members were supposed to have a yield stress of 300 mpa moreover young s modulus e and poisson s ratio ν were taken to be 210 gpa and 0 3 respectively the welds were modeled in the fe simulations the welds joining the collar plates to the chord surface were designed according to american welding society aws 2015 furthermore the mechanical properties of the welds were defined as the material parameters of the brace members the depth of the welds joining the plates to the chord member was considered the same as the collar plate thickness in this study solid 186 element was utilized for meshing the welds collar plates brace members and chord member in both un reinforced and the collar plate reinforced joints the element may show any spatial direction a sub zone mesh generation method was applied in the fe modeling for guaranteeing the mesh quality in this method the whole structure is discrete into several different regions according to the computational complexity the mesh produced by this method in the near of the joint intersection is shown in fig 3 to verify the convergence of fe results convergence test with different values of the mesh densities was implemented before meshing the fe models for the parametric investigation nassiraei et al 2017a in this research the collar plates and the chord member were meshed separately after that the ansys contact ability was applied to define the interaction between the reinforcing plates and chord member nonlinear face to face contact method was applied to define the interaction the augmented lagrange producer was implemented as the contact algorithm for solving this contact issue nassiraei et al 2017a also contact was set to be automatically adjusted to close the gap and reduce the penetration close gap reduce penetration command in ansys the contact was detected on gauss points nassiraei et al 2016b ahmadi 2016 for more information about details of contact modeling researchers can refer to ansys contact guideline swanson analysis systems inc 2009 the ends of the chord member were free the tensile load was applied to the brace end in order to take the advantage of the symmetry in geometry loading and boundary conditions only one eighth of the whole x joints were created during the validation phase and parametric investigation the surfaces on the symmetry planes were set with symmetric boundary conditions a nonlinear static analysis was implemented to investigate the nonlinear static performance of the collar plate reinforced x joints both material and geometric nonlinearities were taken furthermore the arc length procedure is used during the fe modeling the arc length procedure was operated by the arclen command in ansys fe code 5 validation of the fe models in the present study the fe package ansys was utilized to simulate the static behavior of the collar plate reinforced tubular x joints in order to validate the developed fe model the results of six experimental tests were used the six experimental tests were carried out by nassiraei et al 2017a three experimental tests were un reinforced x joints the others were the collar plate reinforced x joints all six x joints were under brace compressive load all the details utilized for simulating the specimens in the validation step are listed in tables 1 and 2 fig 4 depicts the load ovalization curves from tests and fe model the load displacement curves of a1 and a2 show the experimental data and fe results of the un reinforced and the collar plate reinforced joints with β 0 25 the curves of a3 and a4 depict the experimental data and fe results of the un reinforced and the collar plate reinforced connections with β 0 54 the experimental data and fe results of the connections with β 0 73 are shown in curves a5 and a6 the comparison of experimental data and numerical results show that the present fe model can well predict the load ovalization curves initial stiffness the ultimate strength of the un reinforced and the collar plate reinforced x joints the values of the ultimate strength obtained from both experimental and numerical approaches are tabulated in table 3 from the results shown in fig 4 and table 3 it can be concluded that the present developed fe model is capable of simulating the static behavior of the collar plate reinforced and the un reinforced tubular x joints 6 geometrical effects on the initial stiffness static strength and failure patterns 6 1 details of parametric study based on the verified fe models an extensive parametric study was implemented to investigate the effect of the dimensionless geometric parameters of the collar plates and the joint on the ultimate strength initial stiffness and failure patterns in the x joints reinforced with collar plates subjected to axially tensile load 138 fe models based on the collar plate size and connection size parameters were created in ansys software package to study the influence of the collar plates on the ultimate strength initial stiffness and failure mechanisms in the collar plate reinforced x joints under brace tensile load in this study the same as research works conducted by choo et al 2004a 2004b nassiraei et al 2017a zhu et al 2017b and li et al 2018a brace to chord intersection angle is 90 for a more general case researchers can refer to research work conducted by qian 2013 the specific values of the parameters are listed in table 4 the fe models were generated with five different β β 0 2 0 4 0 5 0 6 and 0 8 four different γ γ 10 18 20 and 26 two different τ τ 0 7 and 1 0 four different τ c τ c 1 0 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 and four different η η 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 0 values for determining the ultimate strength in the tubular connections under axial load lu et al 1994 proposed a method they recommended deformation limit equal to 3 d relative to the chord center for x joints 3 d relative to the chord center equals to 6 d relative to the chord bottom in the present paper this method is used for determining the ultimate strength such as research works conducted by choo et al 2005 van der vegte et al 2005 nassiraei et al 2016a 2016b 2016d 2016e 2017a zhu et al 2016 2017a 2017b and li et al 2018a for unreinforced and reinforced tubular joints under compressive and tensile load in addition for connections with a clear peak before the deformation limit the strength value at the peak load was considered as an ultimate strength moreover choo et al 2003 proposed a new approach in the definition of joint strength for thick walled circular hollow section chs x joint subjected to brace axial loading this is based on the plastic load approach also fracture failure is an important failure mode in the determining the ultimate strength of the tubular joints in the present research work the computed static strength does not consider the fracture failure of the material the same as research works conducted on the static strength of t y joints reinforced with collar plates under tensile load nassiraei et al 2016b choo et al 2005 van der vegte et al 2005 and research work carried out on the static capacity of x joints reinforced with collar plates under ipb load choo et al 2004a for more information about this failure mode researchers can refer to the research works conducted by qian et al 2005 gu et al 2016 qian and zhang 2015 6 2 effect of the β on the initial stiffness ultimate strength and failure patterns 12 charts are presented in fig 5 showing the load ovalization curves of the un reinforced and the collar plate reinforced x joints result shows that the initial stiffness in the reinforced connections is remarkably bigger than the initial static stiffness in the corresponding un reinforced connections furthermore the increase of the β in models having fixed value of chord diameter d results in the considerable increase of the initial stiffness in addition the initial stiffness in the joints with bigger collar plate size is bigger these results can be observed in all joints with small intermediate and big values of the β β 0 2 0 5 and 0 8 fig 6 depicts the ultimate strength of the joints comparison of results shows the ultimate strength of the reinforced joints are significantly bigger than the ultimate strength of the corresponding un reinforced joints furthermore the increase of the β leads to significant increase of the ultimate strength in the collar plate reinforced x joints under tensile load because the length of the reinforcing plate is a ratio of the brace diameter hence the increase of the β results in the increase of the brace diameter and collar plate length as a result the increase of the β leads to the increase of the static stiffness hence the increase of the β results in the considerable enhancement of the initial stiffness and ultimate strength in x joints with collar plates furthermore the enhancing effect of the reinforcing plate thickness and the reinforcing plate length on the ultimate strength becomes more considerable when one of these parameters is big fig 7 presents the strength ratios of the collar plate reinforced joints to the corresponding un reinforced joints results show that the increase of the β from 0 2 to 0 5 can lead to significant increase of the strength ratios but the increase of the β from 0 5 to 0 8 cannot result in the significant increase of the strength ratios in fig 7c for the connections with η 0 5 0 75 and 1 0 the strength ratios are significantly bigger than the corresponding strength ratio for the joint with η 0 25 because the un bent collar plate length exceeds half of the surroundings of the chord section for the joints with η 0 5 0 75 and 1 0 in this situation an equivalent complete ring of the bottom and top collar plates forms a more direct and effective load transferring pattern fig 8 shows the deformed shapes of a collar plate reinforced x joint and the corresponding un reinforced x joint the same tensile load value was used for both of the joints results show that deformation of the collar plate reinforced joint is significantly smaller than the deformation of the corresponding un reinforced joint fig 8a and b in fig 8c clear difference can be observed between the deformed shape and un deformed shape of the un reinforced x joints but in fig 8d the deformed shape and the un deformed shape of the collar plate reinforced x joints are very close together hence the collar plate can lead to the significant reduction of the displacement in the x joints under tensile load fig 9 depicts the deformed shapes of two collar plate reinforced x joint with different β values β 0 2 and 0 5 the same tensile load level was applied on the brace end of the two joints comparison fig 10 a and b shows that the deformation of the reinforced joint with small β β 0 2 is significantly bigger than the deformation of the corresponding reinforced joint with intermediate β β 0 5 results show that for the reinforced x joints the increase of the β leads to the decrease of the deformation because the increase of the β leads to the increase of the brace diameter d and collar plate length η the increase of the d and η result in the enhancement of the chord member stiffness in the load direction comparison the results shows that both the collar plate thickness and the collar plate length have remarkable effect on the static behavior of x joints under tensile load results show that the increase of η and τ c results in the increase of the initial stiffness and ultimate strength there are two key reasons 1 the increase of the plate length results in the increase of the region plastic 2 the increase of the plate thickness leads to the increase of the chord wall thickness brace thickness and brae diameter in the vicinity of the brace to chord intersection consequently the increase of the plate size results in the increase of the static stiffness of the chord wall near the joint intersection 6 3 effect of the γ on the initial stiffness ultimate strength and failure patterns fig 10 shows the load ovalization curves of the un reinforced and collar plate reinforced x joints with γ 10 18 and 26 results show that the initial stiffness in the reinforced joints with smaller γ are significantly bigger furthermore the initial stiffness in the reinforced joints is remarkably bigger than the initial stiffness in the corresponding un reinforced joints in addition the increase of the plate thickness and the plate length leads to the increase of the initial stiffness in fig 10k for the joints with γ 10 0 η 1 0 and τ c bigger than 1 25 the increase of the plate thickness cannot result in the increase of the static strength however for the joints with γ 18 and 26 η 1 0 and τ c bigger than 1 25 increase of the plate thickness can considerably lead to the increase of the ultimate strength fig 10k and l the difference among the performance of these reinforced joints is because of failure position for the plate reinforced joints with γ 10 0 η 1 0 and τ c bigger than 1 25 the brace failure occurred before the chord plastification fig 11 a and c on the contrary for the plate reinforced joints with γ 18 and 26 η 1 0 and τ c bigger than 1 25 the joint failure occurred before the brace failure fig 11b and d when the static stiffness of the joint in load direction becomes higher than the static stiffness of the brace wall in load direction the brace failure will be occur before the joint failure in this situation the increase of the collar size cannot be useful consequently for these joint geometries γ 10 0 β 0 6 η 1 0 and τ c bigger than 1 25 the increase of the plate thickness cannot result in the increase of the joint strength for this range of joint geometry it is economically interesting to apply the collar plates with smaller thickness but for the corresponding joints with γ 18 and 26 the increase of the plate thickness even for τ c bigger than 1 25 leads to the significant enhancement of the joint strength because there is no brace failure before joint failure fig 12 shows that the ultimate strength of the collar plate reinforced connections are remarkably bigger than the ultimate strength of the corresponding un reinforced connections this result can be concluded for all joints with small γ ratio say γ 10 intermediate γ ratio say γ 18 and big γ ratio say γ 26 in addition fig 12 show that the decrease of the γ leads to the increase of the ultimate strength in the collar plate reinforced x joints because the thickness of the reinforcing plate is a ratio of the chord wall thickness hence the reduction of the γ leads to the increase of the chord wall thickness and the reinforcing plate thickness consequently the reduction of the γ results in the enhancement of the static stiffness of the reinforced joints near the joint intersection therefore the reduction of the γ leads to the remarkable enhancement of the initial static stiffness and ultimate strength of x joints with collar plates in addition the enhancing influence of the reinforcing plate thickness and reinforcing plate length on the ultimate strength becomes more remarkable when one of these parameters is big fig 13 indicates the strength ratios of the collar plate reinforced connections to the corresponding un reinforced joints results show that the increase of the plate size leads to the increase of the strength ratios fig 13 indicates that the change of the γ for the reinforced connections with η 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 cannot result in the change of the strength ratios but for the reinforced connections with η 1 0 the change of the γ result in the change of the strength ratios because for the reinforced connections with η 1 0 and β 0 6 the un bent reinforcing plate length exceeds half of the surroundings of the chord section therefore an equivalent complete ring of the top and bottom reinforcing plates forms a more powerful load transferring mode for this situation the increase of the γ result in the considerable increase of the strength ratios for instance when the connections are reinforced with η 1 0 and τ c 1 5 the strength ratio for the connections with γ 10 18 and 26 are 2 25 2 8 and 2 95 respectively it can be seen that for the joints with an equivalent complete ring of the top and bottom reinforcing plates the increase of the γ leads to the significant increase of the strength ratios comparison of figs 10 13 shows that both the collar plate length and thickness have remarkable influence on the initial stiffness and ultimate strength result shows that the increase of these parameters leads to the increase of the initial stiffness and ultimate strength fig 14 depicts the equivalent plastic strain and the deformed shapes of a collar plate reinforced x joint and the corresponding un reinforced x joint the same vertical displacement level is applied on the brace end of the joints comparison of equivalent plastic strains in fig 14a and b shows that the use of the collar plate cannot lead to the change of maximum plastic strain position in both the un reinforced and the collar plate reinforced x joints maximum plastic strain occurred the joint intersection near the saddle points however fig 14c and d shows that the use of the plate results in the remarkable reduction of the displacement in the chord center as it can be seen the deformation of the chord center in the reinforced joints fig 14d is significantly smaller than the deformation of the chord center in the corresponding un reinforced joints fig 14c fig 15 shows the deformed shapes of two collar plate reinforced x joint with different γ values γ 18 and 26 the same tensile load value is used for the two joints comparison fig 15a and b depicts that the deformation in the joint with intermediate γ γ 18 is smaller than the corresponding deformation in the joint with big γ γ 26 therefore for the collar plate reinforced x joints the increase of the γ results in the increase of the deformation because the decrease of the γ results in the increase of the chord wall thickness t and the collar plate thickness τ c the increase of the t and the τ c leads to the enhancement of chord member stiffness in the near joint intersection 6 4 effect of the τ on the static performance fig 16 reveals that by increasing the τ from 0 7 to 1 0 the initial stiffness of the un reinforced joints are constant however for the reinforced joints the increase of the τ in models having fixed value of the t results in the small increase of the initial stiffness but the increase of the collar plate length and thickness leads to the remarkable increase of the initial stiffness the same result can be observed for the ultimate strength values in fig 17 furthermore fig 18 depicts that the strength ratios of the connections with τ 1 0 are a little bigger than the corresponding values for the joints with τ 0 7 for instance for the joints reinforced with τ c 1 25 and η 1 0 the strength ratio for the joints with τ 0 7 and 1 0 are 1 70 and 1 81 respectively 6 5 effect of the η and τc on the failure patterns fig 19 shows that the deformed shapes of the un reinforced and the collar plate reinforced x joints along the chord s longitudinal axis fig 19a depicts the deformed shape of the un reinforced joint fig 19b d shows the deformed shapes of the joints with different values of the reinforcing plate thickness τ c and length η for all the un reinforced and the reinforced joints the same tensile load is applied results show the deformation in the collar plate reinforced x joints are significantly smaller than the corresponding un reinforced connections furthermore the increase of the η and τ c leads to the significant reduction of the deformation hence the increase of both η and τ c lead to the increase of the joint strength 7 formulation for static strength of x joints reinforced with collar plates the ultimate strength of the chs connections has been usually derived by the yield line model feng and young 2015 and the ring model van der vegte 1995 for a reinforced tubular joint a modified yield line model has been established by zhu et al 2016 which considered the contribution of stiffeners for estimating the ultimate strength of reinforced circular tubular t connections it was observed that there were only two parameters stiffener wide and ratio of brace diameter to chord diameter related to the ultimate strength ratios but this situation is more arduous for a collar plate reinforced chs x joint four parameters are involved with ultimate strength enhancement coefficient r e including diameter ratio between chord and brace β the ratio of chord radius to chord wall thickness γ the collar plate thickness factor τ c and the collar plate length factor η for this new situation a yield volume model was extended from the modified yield line model recommended by zhu et al 2016 as illustrated in fig 20 in the ultimate load state of un reinforced connections only the intersecting volume between chord and brace v 1 yields is considered but for a collar plate reinforced joint both of the intersecting body between chord and brace v 1 and the body of entire collar plate v 2 yield are considered the calculation diagram is depicted in fig 21 the radius of the chord axial direction of the intersection line is d 2 and the radius of the chord circumferential direction is d 2arcsin β therefore the perimeter p of the intersection line between chord member and brace member can be shown as 1 p π d 2 d 2 arcsin β 2 v 1 p t t 3 sin θ d d β θ arcsin β according to taylor s expansion 4 arcsin β β 1 6 β 3 5 v 1 π 2 d t t

τ c a 4 a 5 a 6 β a 7 a 8 a 9 η a 10 the parameters a 1 a 10 can be calculated through a non linear regression analysis in the software package spss the data imported in spss in the form of a matrix including the values of the dependent variable i e r e and independent variables η τ c β and γ the final formulation can be expressed as 10 r e 1 0 35 β 0 96 γ 0 18 τ c 0 87 1 16 β 16 1 1 99 η 1 34 r 2 0 891 in eq 10 r e is the ultimate strength ratio of the reinforcing plate reinforced to un reinforced x joint under to tensile load r 2 shows the coefficient of determination and its value for the established equation is considered to be acceptable regarding the intricate nature of the problem the valid ranges for the application of eq 10 are as follows 10 γ 26 0 2 β 0 8 1 0 τ c 1 75 0 25 η 1 0 in fig 22 the ultimate strength ratios predicted by the established equation eq 10 are compared with corresponding values extracted from fe analysis it can be observed from fig 22 that there is a good agreement between the values obtained from the derived equation and the values extracted from the fe analysis finally it can be concluded from the value of r 2 r 2 0 891 and fig 22 that the proposed formula can safely be utilized for designing of jacket type platforms and other tubular structures 8 conclusions 138 fe models verified against the experimental data were generated and analyzed to investigate the static behavior of the collar plate reinforced x joints subjected to brace tensile load main conclusions are summarized as follows the ultimate strength of the collar plate reinforced x joints subjected to tensile load can be up to 325 to that of the ultimate strength of the corresponding un reinforced joint subjected to axially tensile load both the collar plate length and the collar plate thickness have remarkable effect on the ultimate strength initial stiffness and failure mechanisms but the increase of the collar plate thickness cannot result in the increase of the static strength for the joints with γ 10 0 β 0 6 η 1 0 and τ c 1 25 in the same applied load the deformation of the reinforced joints is significantly smaller than the deformation of the corresponding un reinforced joint the increase of the β from 0 2 to 0 5 can result in significant enhancement of the strength ratios however the increase of the β from 0 5 to 0 8 cannot lead to the significant enhancement of the strength ratios for the joints with β 0 6 η 1 0 and β 0 8 η 0 5 the use of the collar plates result in the very considerable enhancement of the ultimate strength a theoretical model was derived for determining the ultimate strength of the collar plate reinforced tubular x joints subjected to tensile load high coefficient of determinations obtained for the equation guarantees the accuracy of the formula therefore the derived theoretical equation can reliably be applied to the static design of offshore jacket structures and other tubular structures acknowledgements the authors
