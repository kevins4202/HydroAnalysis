3045,sediment flux in rivers has dropped globally in the past decades due to the increasing anthropogenic stressors leading to significant riverbed degradation that may endanger the instream structures collapse the banks and affect the riverine environment to stabilise riverbeds grade control structures gcss have been widely applied in degrading channels however further understanding of the impacts of gcs on large scale compound channels with a main channel and floodplains is needed this paper reports a failure case of grade control in a large scale compound channel shi ting river china including a comparison of the bed profile measured using the structure from motion sfm technique before and after the flood season the impacts of two improperly designed gcs on the bed morphology of the studied river reach are analysed and the reasons for failure of the present case are discussed based on numerical flow modelling the results of numerical flow modelling and the measured bed profile indicate that the skewed mainstream flow direction in a curved main channel and the local scour downstream of a high drop gcs 3 8 m led to massive erosion on the floodplain near the gcs significantly increasing the width and cross sectional area of the main channel near the gcs consequently the flow bypassed the gcs through the eroded area of the floodplain leading to the dysfunction of the gcs due to the gcs dysfunction a 5 year return period flood caused over 1 3 million m3 of erosion in the studied river reach length 3 1 km inducing severe bed degradation up to 10 m and reducing the width depth ratio of the main channel upstream of the gcs through comparing the present study with the documented cases from literature it is found that the bed degradation induced by gcs failure in compound channels develops much faster than those induced by sediment mining weir or dam construction and reafforestation based on the analysed failure reasons recommendations are

uploaded to the figshare data repository https figshare com s 3ea79198e1cceedc2e5c 1 introduction the flow and sediment fluxes are determinant factors to river morpho dynamic process in the past decades the sediment flux in rivers has dropped globally due to the increasing anthropogenic stressors such as large scale damming sediment mining and water and soil conservation gomby 2017 best 2019 li et al 2020 the global trend of sediment flux reduction has significantly affected the morphology and the environment of many rivers best 2019 one of the most direct consequences of sediment flux reduction is riverbed degradation which usually occurs when the sediment supply rate is less than the erosion capacity of the flow galay 1983 chen et al 2006 lu et al 2007 the riverbed degradation can cause general scour at instream structures such as bridges culverts and pipelines endangering their structural stability the riverbed degradation may lead to bank collapses by producing an over heightened or over steepened condition of the banks nrcs natural resources conservations service 2007 the sediment eroded from the degrading channels may deposit downstream increasing the flood peaks and adversely impacting flood control channels martín vide and llasat 2018 this sediment also carries significant amounts of nutrients e g phosphorus which may degrade the water quality and riverine habitat nrcs natural resources conservations service 2007 furthermore the lowered water table by riverbed degradation can increase the water intake cost and affect the riparian vegetation enhancing the intrusion of the salt wedge into the lower delta plain channels gölz 1994 shields et al 1994 gong and shen 2011 eslami et al 2021 in a degrading channel grade control defined as any alterations in the watershed that increase the riverbed stability in the widest sense is required in practice the most common method to establish grade control is to construct instream grade control structures gcss such as weirs check dams and bed sills radspinner et al 2010 galia et al 2019 belletti et al 2020 guan et al 2022 to design the gcs properly it is important to understand the impacts of gcss on the bed morpho dynamic and sediment transport processes in rivers martín vide and andreatta 2006 2009 studied the impacts of sequential bed sills on the longitudinal bed profile of degrading channels based on field survey and flume tests proposing predictors for estimating the equilibrium bed slope bombino et al 2008 2014 conducted a field survey in a series of italian streams investigating the impacts of check dams on sediment entrainment they found that check dams can reduce the transport rate of fine particles increasing the moisture retention of the channel galia and škarpich 2017 surveyed a series of piedmont rivers investigating the impacts of gcss on sediment transport and entrainment in piedmont rivers they concluded that a gcs can reduce the continuity and rate of sediment transport increasing the sediment size downstream of the gcs piton and recking 2017 conducted a series of flume tests to investigate the impacts of check dams on bedload transport and bed morphology in steep streams their experimental results indicate that the gcs can reduce the active volume the maximum volume filled and eroded in a river reach increasing the frequency and decreasing the amplitude of bed level fluctuation the aforementioned studies were mainly conducted in laboratories or small streams in a single channel shape studies in large scale rivers especially in compound channels with a main channel and floodplains knight and haned 1984 liu et al 2016 are scarce as the bed morpho dynamic process in large scale rivers is more complicated than that in small streams the conclusions of the existing studies may not be applicable to grade control in large scale rivers which are worthy of more investigation this paper describes a field study on a failure case of grade control in a degrading large scale river compound channel channel width 300 400 m including an analysis of the impacts of two improperly designed gcss on the riverbed morphology the studied area is in shi ting river sichuan province china which has experienced significant bed degradation since 2008 fan et al 2016 the study compares the detailed bed profile measured by the structure from motion sfm technique before and after the flood season analysis of the reasons of the grade control failure based on numerical flow modelling is included lessons from the reported case are summarised and design recommendations are proposed for grade control in large scale compound channels 2 background 2 1 research area to investigate the impacts of inappropriate grade control on large scale degrading compound channels a field survey was conducted in shi ting river fig 1 in which the riverbed has degraded significantly since 2008 fan et al 2016 the shi ting river originates from the longmen mountain epicentre of the 5 12 wenchuan ms 8 0 earthquake in 2008 and joins the tuo river the first tributary of changjiang river in the chengdu plain sichuan province china the river is about 120 km long and has a basin area of 1501 km2 the mountainous reach upstream reach of the shi ting river is about 60 km long with a mean gradient of 44 the mean gradient of the river reach downstream of the mountainous area is 3 6 the shi ting river is a seasonal river in which the flow for most of the year is negligible annual average flow 20 1 m3 s in the flood season usually from july to august the flow can be a hundred times the annual average flow due to the summer and autumn monsoons the magnitudes of 2 year 10 year and 50 year return period floods are 600 m3 s 2 095 m3 s and 3 437 m3 s respectively fan et al 2016 the studied river reach is basically between the renmin people canal and the 105th provincial highway bridge figs 1 and 2 which is about 3 1 km long and 300 400 m wide and channelised by a concrete embankment the renmin canal is a river crossing canal supplying the drinking and irrigation water for over a million people in deyang city sichuan province the renmin canal was initially buried in the river bed of shi ting river and had a crest approximately at the same level of the river bed in 2008 before the 5 12 wenchuan earthquake fig 2b 2 2 gcs failure after 2008 the post earthquake reconstruction led to massive riverbed mining inducing significant bed degradation in the piedmont reach of the shi ting river fan et al 2016 the studied area was the most degraded reach of the shi ting river in which the maximum bed degradation depth exceeded 20 m such that the foundations of the renmin canal and bridges were significantly scoured fig 2b to protect the 105th provincial highway bridge a grade control structure gcs 0 was built about 100 m downstream the bridge in 2011 however as the bed degradation downstream of gcs 0 continued a photo of gcs 0 before collapse is shown in fig 3 a gcs 0 collapsed after the flood season in 2017 fig 3b as a consequence the 105th provincial highway bridge failed due to significant general scour fig 3c and was replaced by a new bridge fig 3d the bed degradation moved upstream and threatened the stability of the chengmian duplicate expressway bridge built in 2012 fig 2b and the chenglan railway bridge built in 2013 fig 2b to protect the chengmian duplicate expressway bridge and the chenglan railway bridge two gcss were built downstream in 2018 i e gcs 1 and gcs 2 shown in fig 2b in 2018 the studied river reach was a compound channel that includes a main channel and two floodplains the two gcss were built in the main channel with a crest approximately levelled with the floodplain gcs 1 is about 200 m wide and 3 8 m high above the downstream bed gcs 2 is about 80 m wide and 4 7 m above the downstream bed both gcs 1 and gcs 2 were made of a concrete crest supported by piles pile diameter 1 8 m the distance between two piles 2 2 m the gap between the piles was filled by steel barriers as the flood in 2019 was insignificant peak flow 630 m3 s with a 2 year return period the bed morphology of the studied area was nearly unchanged and the two gcss were stable only slight erosion occurred on the right floodplain near the gcs 2 during the flood season of 2019 fig 4 a however after the flood season in 2020 peak flow 1300 m3 s with a 5 year return period as shown in fig 5 b the two gcss failed and significantly changed the bed morphology of the studied river reach fig 4b the present study measured the bed profile of the studied river reach before and after the flood season of 2020 named as survey 1 and survey 2 in fig 5a the methodology of bed profile measurement is presented in the next section 3 methodology 3 1 bed profile measurement the river bed profile was measured using the structure from motion sfm technique smith et al 2014 javernick et al 2014 the photos were taken using a drone dji mavic 2 with a camera hasselblad l1d 20c and gps that can measure the coordinate information including longitude latitude and altitude of the shooting point photos with a resolution of 5472 3648 pixels were taken continuously in the studied river reach at a height of 500 m the overlap between two adjacent photos is greater than 2 3 in the area near the bridges more photos were taken at a height of 150 m for obtaining more accurate data fig 6 the study included two bed profile measurements before may 29 and after september 4 the flood season of 2020 named as survey 1 and survey 2 in fig 5a in these two surveys the flow was negligible and the flow depth in the channel was 1 m based on direct measurement thus the measured river bed profile by sfm is approximately the same as that under the water the photos taken by the drone were transferred to a digital elevation model dem and orthoimages using the sfm software agisoft metashape professional a series of highly visible positions in the studied area were selected as reference points for generating the dem based on wgs 84 coordinates jaud et al 2016 a real time kinematic rtk was used to measure the wgs 84 coordinates of the reference points the horizontal and elevation errors of the rtk are within 0 03 m and 0 06 m respectively the rtk also measured 23 data points for calibration the calibration results indicate that the errors of the generated dem are within 1 m 0 77 m 0 71 m and 0 95 m in the x y and z directions respectively the software arcgis pro was used to read the dem and orthoimage fig 7 and to calculate the variations in volume width and depth of the channel after the flood season 3 2 numerical modelling numerical modelling has been widely used to simulate river flooding and hydrodynamics near hydraulic structures quiroga et al 2016 costabile and macchione 2015 smith et al 2014 wu et al 2014 hsieh et al 2013 which can assist in the analysis of the possible drivers that cause the gcs failure a comparison of numerical models has shown that hec ras offers excellent capabilities in modelling river flooding and floodplain inundation costabile et al 2020 afshari et al 2018 the study used hec ras 2d version 6 0 to simulate the flow in the studied river reach developed by the us army corps of engineers hydrologic engineering centre hec ras 2d solves the two dimensional shallow water equations or diffusive wave equations brunner 2021 which has the capability to simulate water flow through hydraulic structures including culverts and bridges fig 8 shows the upstream and downstream computational boundaries and the computational area in the numerical model the upstream computational boundary is at the toe of the renmin canal the 2d computational area is 1 21 km2 and 3 04 km long as the bridge deck was not submerged during the flood it had no effect on the flow and was not included in the numerical model in the numerical model the bridge piers and gcss are represented by the measured local topography the computational grid size was set as 2 m 2 m as the roughness of the compound channel depends on many parameters e g grain size obstacles and land use etc the present study considered an equivalent manning roughness for the numerical model based on the calibration using the measured water level the equivalent manning s roughness was determined as n 0 03 the time step was set as a constant value of 1 s the model parameters are summarised in table 1 the flow measured at the gaojingguan hydrologic station about 15 km upstream of the renmin canal was taken as the input to the upstream boundary two unsteady simulations were conducted based on two flow values 541 m3 s and 1300 m3 s and the dem before the flood season i e the initial bed profile water levels from measurements or surveys can be used for the validation of hydrodynamic modelling especially during an extreme or unexpected event with limited recorded data guan et al 2016a takagi et al 2016 xu et al 2018 as the flow conditions inundation area and water level were surveyed in situ the flow rate 541 m3 s occurred at 19 00 in august 12 was used to validate the numerical model the hec ras simulated water level at the chengmian duplicate expressway bridge of 541 m3 s is 548 71 m agreeing well with the measured value at the same location 548 72 m as the surveyed inundation area shown in the uploaded video link https figshare com s 3ea79198e1cceedc2e5c also qualitatively agrees well with the simulation results it is reasonable to consider the numerical model is valid and reliable the peak flow of the flood season 1300 m3 s which occurred at 06 10 on august 17 was considered as the critical flow to cause the grade control failure thus the numerical flow modelling results based on 1300 m3 s were used to analyse the reasons for the present failure case in this study the scouring process and the bank collapse were not simulated the variation of riverbed morphology was analysed directly using the dem before and after the flood season 4 results 4 1 channel bed variation around gcss fig 9 compares the orthoimages of the area around gcs 1 and gcs 2 before and after the flood season fig 9 indicates that the flood significantly changed the bed morphology around the two gcss the flow significantly eroded the floodplain near the two gcss extensively widening the main channel and completely destroying the concrete revetment on the left floodplain fig 10 depicts the bed elevation variation in the gcs area after the flood season of 2020 as shown in fig 10 on the left floodplain the maximum erosion depth is about 20 m and the erosion area is about 250 m long fig 10 indicates that part of the riverbed between gcs 1 and gcs 2 slightly aggraded maximum aggradation depth 4 m in fig 10 considerable erosion also occurred at the right floodplain near gcs 2 maximum erosion depth 10 m erosion area length 150 m fig 10 shows that the width of the erosion area at gcs 1 is about 180 m and the main channel on both sides of gcs 2 widened about 50 m a quantitative comparison of the dems before and after the flood season indicates that the erosion volume in the gcs area is 692 888 m3 4 2 channel bed variation in nearby channel fig 11 depicts the channel bed profile variation of the studied reach after the flood season in 2020 fig 11 indicates that the channel bed upstream of gcs 1 was eroded significantly during the flood season maximum erosion depth 15 m erosion volume 644081 m3 induced by the dysfunction of gcs 1 as a result of bed erosion part of the left floodplain upstream of gcs 1 became unsupported and collapsed fig 12 presents the longitudinal bed profile based on the thalweg of the studied river reach in which x is the distance from the renmin canal fig 12 shows that the bed elevation of the channel upstream of gcs 1 degraded significantly maximum degradation depth 10 m and the bed slope upstream of the gcs 1 steepened from 3 to 5 5 in fig 12 the bed level downstream of gcs 2 was nearly unchanged indicating that the eroded sediment was transported further downstream fig 12 indicates that the thalweg level between gcs 1 and gcs 2 generally dropped after the flood season although part of the bed aggraded slightly in this area fig 10 fig 13 presents the variations of cross sectional characteristics of the main channel in the studied river reach after the flood season of 2020 fig 13a indicates that in the river reach upstream of gcs 1 0 x 1200 m the main channel width increased by about 70 near the renmin canal 0 x 300 m but was nearly unchanged variation 10 for 300 m x 1200 m in fig 13a the main channel width increased significantly 100 near the two gcss and increased slightly 15 downstream of gcs 2 1500 m x 3000 m fig 13b shows that the cross sectional area of the main channel generally increased in the studied river reach in which the maximum area enlargement 200 occurred near the renmin canal and the two gcss due to significant bed degradation and channel widening fig 13c indicates that the width depth ratio of the main channel generally decreased upstream of the gcs 1 x 1200 m due to the significant bed degradation induced by the gcs dysfunction fig 12 while that near the gcs 2 increased slightly as the channel widened at both sides of gcs 2 as shown in fig 10 in fig 13c the width depth ratio of the main channel in the river reach downstream of gcs 2 1500 m x 3000 m was nearly unchanged 5 discussion the results presented in section 4 of this paper indicate that the bed erosion around gcs 1 and gcs 2 significantly widened and shifted the main channel leading to extensive bed degradation upstream of gcs 1 thus the bed morpho dynamic process in the area around gcs 1 and gcs 2 is critical to the failure of grade control and needs to be analysed in detail this section is a discussion of the reasons for failure of gcs 1 and gcs 2 based on the numerical flow modelling results described in section 3 2 of this paper fig 14 depicts the depth averaged velocity and the distribution of shear stress in the area around gcs 1 and gcs 2 based on the dem obtained on may 29 2020 before the flood season and peak flow 1300 m3 s the shear stress τ is calculated as 1 τ γ h s w where γ is the weight density of water n m3 h is the water depth on each calculation grid cell m s w is the water surface slope i e the vertical difference in the water surface divided by the horizontal distance fig 14a indicates that the mainstream flow was skewed to the left floodplain about 40 when it passed gcs 1 and tended to erode the left floodplain which was protected by concrete revetment fig 2b in fig 14 the flow velocity and the shear stress increased significantly after dropping from the crest of gcs 1 maximum drop height 8 m leading to local scour on the downstream riverbed consequently the revetment on the left floodplain collapsed due to the local scour and the mainstream flow caused significant erosion on the left floodplain near gcs 1 figs 9 10 fig 14a shows that the flow shifted to approach the right floodplain after it passed gcs 1 creating a zone of high velocity and shear stress at the right side of gcs 2 as a result the shifted flow caused significant erosion at the right floodplain near gcs 2 fig 9 a video taken during the flood event confirms that the mainstream flow pattern is consistent to the numerical model results described above this video was uploaded as supplementary material and can be accessed through the link https figshare com s 3ea79198e1cceedc2e5c fig 15 presents the lateral distributions of bed elevation depth average velocity vda and shear stress τ at gcs 1 and gcs 2 before the failure of gcss in which z is the bed elevation and l is the lateral distance from the left bank fig 15a b indicate that vda and τ increased significantly after passing the crest of gcs 1 from about 5 m s and 200 pa to over 15 m s and 2000 pa respectively however as the right half of the riverbed downstream of gcs 1 was protected by a stilling basin fig 14 that can reduce the turbulence energy and adapt the velocity profile hoffmans and verheij 1997 the shear stress and velocity in this area dropped significantly after exiting the stilling basin from about 12 m s and 1200 pa to 3 6 m s and 160 pa respectively consequently the local scour was minimised and the bed level in this area was nearly unchanged as a result the revetment on the left floodplain collapsed and the mainstream flow caused significant erosion on the left floodplain near gcs 1 in fig 15b the water level downstream of gcs 1 was non uniform due to the strong fluctuation of the dropping flow fig 15c d show that the flow velocity and shear stress upstream and downstream of gcs 2 were nearly unchanged as the water level upstream z 537 m and downstream z 536 m of gcs 2 were nearly the same as the mainstream flow downstream of gcs 1 was shifted to approach the right floodplain fig 14a the flow velocity and shear stress on the right side 12 m s and 2000 pa were greater than those on the left side 2 m s and 100 pa of gcs 2 fig 15c d it should be noted that the present study only conducted a 2d numerical simulation the secondary flow pattern was unknown although it has considerable impacts on the bed morpho dynamic and local scour process at a gcs ben meftah and mossa 2006 2020 the secondary flow can affect the geometry of scour hole downstream of a gcs creating a greater scour depth at the channel bank than that at the channel centreline guan et al 2014 in a curved channel the secondary flow can increase the velocity at the outer bank increasing the erodibility of flow in this area guan et al 2016b thus to better understand the scour or bed morpho dynamic process around a gcs the secondary flow data are required for future studies 6 lessons and design recommendations the reported case study indicates that the morpho dynamic process in a large scale compound channel is much more complex than that in a single channel such that grade control design in large scale compound channels is more challenging and more factors e g the mainstream flow direction and the local scour downstream of a gcs need to be considered the bed degradation process in a compound channel is different from that in a single channel for a single channel the bed degradation usually develops across the whole width of the channel martín vide and andreatta 2006 2009 for a compound channel as the flow intensity in the main channel is generally greater than that on floodplains liu et al 2016 usually the bed degradation is initiated in the main channel as the main channel deepens based on our field observation in shi ting river the flow enters the main channel from the floodplain increasing the flow erodibility in the main channel fig 16 in a degrading compound channel a gcs with a crest nearly aligned with the floodplain built in the main channel same as that shown in fig 15 can cause a rise of the upstream water level to above the floodplain level fig 17 a as a result the flow passes the gcs through the floodplain and then drops to the downstream main channel inducing erosion on the floodplain fig 17b the mechanism described in fig 17 applies to the variation of cross sections near the two gcss presented in fig 15 if the gcs is built in a curved main channel the mainstream flow may be skewed fig 14a and near the gcs tends to erode the floodplain on the outer side of a curved in plan compound river channel as shown in fig 18 a if the gcs is built with a high crest level relative to the downstream bed level fig 15 the flow over the gcs may cause significant local scour downstream fig 18b leading to the collapse of the floodplain in the scoured area once the floodplain near the gcs has been eroded or has collapsed the mainstream flow may bypass the gcs through the eroded or collapsed area in this scenario the gcs is no longer capable of blocking the upstream sediment transport leading to the failure of grade control figs 11 12 the mechanism described in fig 18 applies to the massive erosion near the two gcss shown in fig 10 table 2 compared the present study with the documented cases of bed degradation from literature the comparison indicates that the bed degradation of the present study during one flood season is at the same order of those of the documented cases over a much longer period greater than 10 years for example pearl river in china degraded maximumly 11 29 m from 1990 to 2003 lu et al 2007 po river in north italy degraded maximumly 6 m from 1880 to 1990 s rinaldi et al 2005 rhône river in south france degraded maximumly 4 m from 1952 to 1990 petit et al 1996 the comparison in table 2 indicates that the bed degradation induced by gcs failure in compound channels develops much faster than those induced by sediment mining weir or dam construction and reafforestation the above analysis indicates that the stability of a floodplain is critical to the grade control in large scale compound channels based on the mechanisms described above we propose the following recommendations for gcs design in large scale compound channels 1 the gcs should be built in a straight main channel which is parallel to the channel bank 2 the floodplain near the gcs should be protected 3 a series of low head gcss are recommended instead of a single high drop gcs for reducing local scour and 4 countermeasures for local scour should be applied for each gcs 7 conclusions this paper describes a field study of a failure case of grade control in a large scale compound channel a 3 1 km long and 300 400 m wide reach of shi ting river in china comprising analysis of the reasons for failure and the impacts of two improperly designed grade control structures gcss on the river bed morphology based on the field data and numerical flow modelling results the field survey results indicate that the flood in 2020 caused massive erosion in the area around the two gcss maximum erosion depth 20 m erosion volume 692 888 m3 the numerical modelling results show that the mainstream flow upstream of the gcs was skewed as the main channel is curved tending to erode the floodplain protected by concrete revetment the numerical results also indicate that the flow accelerated after dropping from the gcs crest level 3 8 m above the downstream bed level significantly increasing the velocity and shear stress and causing local scour downstream of the gcs as a result the revetment on the floodplain failed and the mainstream flow caused significant erosion on the floodplain the flow bypassed the gcs through the eroded area of the floodplain leading to the dysfunction of the gcs consequently the channel upstream of the gcs significantly degraded maximum degradation depth 10 m erosion volume 644081 m3 and steepened from 3 to 5 5 due to the gcs dysfunction the width and cross sectional area of the main channel near the renmin canal and the gcss increased significantly the main channel width depth ratio generally decreased upstream of the gcss and was nearly unchanged downstream of the gcss for the reported case study it is apparent that erosion on the floodplain is a key reason for the dysfunction of the gcs it is concluded that grade control in large scale compound channels should consider the mainstream flow direction and the local scour downstream of a gcs which are factors that may cause massive erosion on the floodplain through comparing the present study with the documented cases of bed degradation from literature it is found that the bed degradation induced by gcs failure in compound channels develops much faster than those induced by sediment mining weir or dam construction and reafforestation based on the analysis of the reasons for failure of the reported case study design recommendations are proposed for grade control in large scale compound channels the present study is the first reported failure case of grade control in a large scale compound channel with detailed topography data before and after the flood period the findings of the present study have improved the understanding of the impacts of gcss on the bed morpho dynamic process in compound channels the presented prototype data is also valuable to the development of theoretical or numerical models for predicting the bed morphology of a compound channel after building gcss the analysed failure reasons of the present case have highlighted the important topics that need to be further investigated the proposed design recommendations can provide guidance for grade control in degrading compound channels credit authorship contribution statement lu wang supervision methodology formal analysis

3045,sediment flux in rivers has dropped globally in the past decades due to the increasing anthropogenic stressors leading to significant riverbed degradation that may endanger the instream structures collapse the banks and affect the riverine environment to stabilise riverbeds grade control structures gcss have been widely applied in degrading channels however further understanding of the impacts of gcs on large scale compound channels with a main channel and floodplains is needed this paper reports a failure case of grade control in a large scale compound channel shi ting river china including a comparison of the bed profile measured using the structure from motion sfm technique before and after the flood season the impacts of two improperly designed gcs on the bed morphology of the studied river reach are analysed and the reasons for failure of the present case are discussed based on numerical flow modelling the results of numerical flow modelling and the measured bed profile indicate that the skewed mainstream flow direction in a curved main channel and the local scour downstream of a high drop gcs 3 8 m led to massive erosion on the floodplain near the gcs significantly increasing the width and cross sectional area of the main channel near the gcs consequently the flow bypassed the gcs through the eroded area of the floodplain leading to the dysfunction of the gcs due to the gcs dysfunction a 5 year return period flood caused over 1 3 million m3 of erosion in the studied river reach length 3 1 km inducing severe bed degradation up to 10 m and reducing the width depth ratio of the main channel upstream of the gcs through comparing the present study with the documented cases from literature it is found that the bed degradation induced by

decades the sediment flux in rivers has dropped globally due to the increasing anthropogenic stressors such as large scale damming sediment mining and water and soil conservation gomby 2017 best 2019 li et al 2020 the global trend of sediment flux reduction has significantly affected the morphology and the environment of many rivers best 2019 one of the most direct consequences of sediment flux reduction is riverbed degradation which usually occurs when the sediment supply rate is less than the erosion capacity of the flow galay 1983 chen et al 2006 lu et al 2007 the riverbed degradation can cause general scour at instream structures such as bridges culverts and pipelines endangering their structural stability the riverbed degradation may lead to bank collapses by producing an over heightened or over steepened condition of the banks nrcs natural resources conservations service 2007 the sediment eroded from the degrading channels may deposit downstream increasing the flood peaks and adversely impacting flood control channels martín vide and llasat 2018 this sediment also carries significant amounts of nutrients e g phosphorus which may degrade the water quality and riverine habitat nrcs natural resources conservations service 2007 furthermore the lowered water table by riverbed degradation can increase the water intake cost and affect the riparian vegetation enhancing the intrusion of the salt wedge into the lower delta plain channels gölz 1994 shields et al 1994 gong and shen 2011 eslami et al 2021 in a degrading channel grade control defined as any alterations in the watershed that increase the riverbed stability in the widest sense is required in practice the most common method to establish grade control is to construct instream grade control structures gcss such as weirs check dams and bed sills radspinner et al 2010 galia et al 2019 belletti et al 2020 guan et al 2022 to design the gcs properly it is important to understand the impacts of gcss on the bed morpho dynamic and sediment transport processes in rivers martín vide and andreatta 2006 2009 studied the impacts of sequential bed sills on the longitudinal bed profile of degrading channels based on field survey and flume tests proposing predictors for estimating the equilibrium bed slope bombino et al 2008 2014 conducted a field survey in a series of italian streams investigating the impacts of check dams on sediment entrainment they found that check dams can reduce the transport rate of fine particles increasing the moisture retention of the channel galia and škarpich 2017 surveyed a series of piedmont rivers investigating the impacts of gcss on sediment transport and entrainment in piedmont rivers they concluded that a gcs can reduce the continuity and rate of sediment transport increasing the sediment size downstream of the gcs piton and recking 2017 conducted a series of flume tests to investigate the impacts of check dams on bedload transport and bed morphology in steep streams their experimental results indicate that the gcs can reduce the active volume the maximum volume filled and eroded in a river reach increasing the frequency and decreasing the amplitude of bed level fluctuation the aforementioned studies were mainly conducted in laboratories or small streams in a single channel shape studies in large scale rivers especially in compound channels with a main channel and floodplains knight and haned 1984 liu et al 2016 are scarce as the bed morpho dynamic process in large scale rivers is more complicated than that in small streams the conclusions of the existing studies may not be applicable to grade control in large scale rivers which are worthy of more investigation this paper describes a field study on a failure case of grade control in a degrading large scale river compound channel channel width 300 400 m including an analysis of the impacts of two improperly designed gcss on the riverbed morphology the studied area is in shi ting river sichuan province china which has experienced significant bed degradation since 2008 fan et al 2016 the study compares the detailed bed profile measured by the structure from motion sfm technique before and after the flood season analysis of the reasons of the grade control failure based on numerical flow modelling is included lessons from the reported case are summarised and design recommendations are proposed for grade control in large scale compound channels 2 background 2 1 research area to investigate the impacts of inappropriate grade control on large scale degrading compound channels a field survey was conducted in shi ting river fig 1 in which the riverbed has degraded significantly since 2008 fan et al 2016 the shi ting river originates from the longmen mountain epicentre of the 5 12 wenchuan ms 8 0 earthquake in 2008 and joins the tuo river the first tributary of changjiang river in the chengdu plain sichuan province china the river is about 120 km long and has a basin area of 1501 km2 the mountainous reach upstream reach of the shi ting river is about 60 km long with a mean gradient of 44 the mean gradient of the river reach downstream of the mountainous area is 3 6 the shi ting river is a seasonal river in which the flow for most of the year is negligible annual average flow 20 1 m3 s in the flood season usually from july to august the flow can be a hundred times the annual average flow due to the summer and autumn monsoons the magnitudes of 2 year 10 year and 50 year return period floods are 600 m3 s 2 095 m3 s and 3 437 m3 s respectively fan et al 2016 the studied river reach is basically between the renmin people canal and the 105th provincial highway bridge figs 1 and 2 which is about 3 1 km long and 300 400 m wide and channelised by a concrete embankment the renmin canal is a river crossing canal supplying the drinking and irrigation water for over a million people in deyang city sichuan province the renmin canal was initially buried in the river bed of shi ting river and had a crest approximately at the same level of the river bed in 2008 before the 5 12 wenchuan earthquake fig 2b 2 2 gcs failure after 2008 the post earthquake reconstruction led to massive riverbed mining inducing significant bed degradation in the piedmont reach of the shi ting river fan et al 2016 the studied area was the most degraded reach of the shi ting river in which the maximum bed degradation depth exceeded 20 m such that the foundations of the renmin canal and bridges were significantly scoured fig 2b to protect the 105th provincial highway bridge a grade control structure gcs 0 was built about 100 m downstream the bridge in 2011 however as the bed degradation downstream of gcs 0 continued a photo of gcs 0 before collapse is shown in fig 3 a gcs 0 collapsed after the flood season in 2017 fig 3b as a consequence the 105th provincial highway bridge failed due to significant general scour fig 3c and was replaced by a new bridge fig 3d the bed degradation moved upstream and threatened the stability of the chengmian duplicate expressway bridge built in 2012 fig 2b and the chenglan railway bridge built in 2013 fig 2b to protect the chengmian duplicate expressway bridge and the chenglan railway bridge two gcss were built downstream in 2018 i e gcs 1 and gcs 2 shown in fig 2b in 2018 the studied river reach was a compound channel that includes a main channel and two floodplains the two gcss were built in the main channel with a crest approximately levelled with the floodplain gcs 1 is about 200 m wide and 3 8 m high above the downstream bed gcs 2 is about 80 m wide and 4 7 m above the downstream bed both gcs 1 and gcs 2 were made of a concrete crest supported by piles pile diameter 1 8 m the distance between two piles 2 2 m the gap between the piles was filled by steel barriers as the flood in 2019 was insignificant peak flow 630 m3 s with a 2 year return period the bed morphology of the studied area was nearly unchanged and the two gcss were stable only slight erosion occurred on the right floodplain near the gcs 2 during the flood season of 2019 fig 4 a however after the flood season in 2020 peak flow 1300 m3 s with a 5 year return period as shown in fig 5 b the two gcss failed and significantly changed the bed morphology of the studied river reach fig 4b the present study measured the bed profile of the studied river reach before and after the flood season of 2020 named as survey 1 and survey 2 in fig 5a the methodology of bed profile measurement is presented in the next section 3 methodology 3 1 bed profile measurement the river bed profile was measured using the structure from motion sfm technique smith et al 2014 javernick et al 2014 the photos were taken using a drone dji mavic 2 with a camera hasselblad l1d 20c and gps that can measure the coordinate information including longitude latitude and altitude of the shooting point photos with a resolution of 5472 3648 pixels were taken continuously in the studied river reach at a height of 500 m the overlap between two adjacent photos is greater than 2 3 in the area near the bridges more photos were taken at a height of 150 m for obtaining more accurate data fig 6 the study included two bed profile measurements before may 29 and after september 4 the flood season of 2020 named as survey 1 and survey 2 in fig 5a in these two surveys the flow was negligible and the flow depth in the channel was 1 m based on direct measurement thus the measured river bed profile by sfm is approximately the same as that under the water the photos taken by the drone were transferred to a digital elevation model dem and orthoimages using the sfm software agisoft metashape professional a series of highly visible positions in the studied area were selected as reference points for generating the dem based on wgs 84 coordinates jaud et al 2016 a real time kinematic rtk was used to measure the wgs 84 coordinates of the reference points the horizontal and elevation errors of the rtk are within 0 03 m and 0 06 m respectively the rtk also measured 23 data points for calibration the calibration results indicate that the errors of the generated dem are within 1 m 0 77 m 0 71 m and 0 95 m in the x y and z directions respectively the software arcgis pro was used to read the dem and orthoimage fig 7 and to calculate the variations in volume width and depth of the channel after the flood season 3 2 numerical modelling numerical modelling has been widely used to simulate river flooding and hydrodynamics near hydraulic structures quiroga et al 2016 costabile and macchione 2015 smith et al 2014 wu et al 2014 hsieh et al 2013 which can assist in the analysis of the possible drivers that cause the gcs failure a comparison of numerical models has shown that hec ras offers excellent capabilities in modelling river flooding and floodplain inundation costabile et al 2020 afshari et al 2018 the study used hec ras 2d version 6 0 to simulate the flow in the studied river reach developed by the us army corps of engineers hydrologic engineering centre hec ras 2d solves the two dimensional shallow water equations or diffusive wave equations brunner 2021 which has the capability to simulate water flow through hydraulic structures including culverts and bridges fig 8 shows the upstream and downstream computational boundaries and the computational area in the numerical model the upstream computational boundary is at the toe of the renmin canal the 2d computational area is 1 21 km2 and 3 04 km long as the bridge deck was not submerged during the flood it had no effect on the flow and was not included in the numerical model in the numerical model the bridge piers and gcss are represented by the measured local topography the computational grid size was set as 2 m 2 m as the roughness of the compound channel depends on many parameters e g grain size obstacles and land use etc the present study considered an equivalent manning roughness for the numerical model based on the calibration using the measured water level the equivalent manning s roughness was determined as n 0 03 the time step was set as a constant value of 1 s the model parameters are summarised in table 1 the flow measured at the gaojingguan hydrologic station about 15 km upstream of the renmin canal was taken as the input to the upstream boundary two unsteady simulations were conducted based on two flow values 541 m3 s and 1300 m3 s and the dem before the flood season i e the initial bed profile water levels from measurements or surveys can be used for the validation of hydrodynamic modelling especially during an extreme or unexpected event with limited recorded data guan et al 2016a takagi et al 2016 xu et al 2018 as the flow conditions inundation area and water level were surveyed in situ the flow rate 541 m3 s occurred at 19 00 in august 12 was used to validate the numerical model the hec ras simulated water level at the chengmian duplicate expressway bridge of 541 m3 s is 548 71 m agreeing well with the measured value at the same location 548 72 m as the surveyed inundation area shown in the uploaded video link https figshare com s 3ea79198e1cceedc2e5c also qualitatively agrees well with the simulation results it is reasonable to consider the numerical model is valid and reliable the peak flow of the flood season 1300 m3 s which occurred at 06 10 on august 17 was considered as the critical flow to cause the grade control failure thus the numerical flow modelling results based on 1300 m3 s were used to analyse the reasons for the present failure case in this study the scouring process and the bank collapse were not simulated the variation of riverbed morphology was analysed directly using the dem before and after the flood season 4 results 4 1 channel bed variation around gcss fig 9 compares the orthoimages of the area around gcs 1 and gcs 2 before and after the flood season fig 9 indicates that the flood significantly changed the bed morphology around the two gcss the flow significantly eroded the floodplain near the two gcss extensively widening the main channel and completely destroying the concrete revetment on the left floodplain fig 10 depicts the bed elevation variation in the gcs area after the flood season of 2020 as shown in fig 10 on the left floodplain the maximum erosion depth is about 20 m and the erosion area is about 250 m long fig 10 indicates that part of the riverbed between gcs 1 and gcs 2 slightly aggraded maximum aggradation depth 4 m in fig 10 considerable erosion also occurred at the right floodplain near gcs 2 maximum erosion depth 10 m erosion area length 150 m fig 10 shows that the width of the erosion area at gcs 1 is about 180 m and the main channel on both sides of gcs 2 widened about 50 m a quantitative comparison of the dems before and after the flood season indicates that the erosion volume in the gcs area is 692 888 m3 4 2 channel bed variation in nearby channel fig 11 depicts the channel bed profile variation of the studied reach after the flood season in 2020 fig 11 indicates that the channel bed upstream of gcs 1 was eroded significantly during the flood season maximum erosion depth 15 m erosion volume 644081 m3 induced by the dysfunction of gcs 1 as a result of bed erosion part of the left floodplain upstream of gcs 1 became unsupported and collapsed fig 12 presents the longitudinal bed profile based on the thalweg of the studied river reach in which x is the distance from the renmin canal fig 12 shows that the bed elevation of the channel upstream of gcs 1 degraded significantly maximum degradation depth 10 m and the bed slope upstream of the gcs 1 steepened from 3 to 5 5 in fig 12 the bed level downstream of gcs 2 was nearly unchanged indicating that the eroded sediment was transported further downstream fig 12 indicates that the thalweg level between gcs 1 and gcs 2 generally dropped after the flood season although part of the bed aggraded slightly in this area fig 10 fig 13 presents the variations of cross sectional characteristics of the main channel in the studied river reach after the flood season of 2020 fig 13a indicates that in the river reach upstream of gcs 1 0 x 1200 m the main channel width increased by about 70 near the renmin canal 0 x 300 m but was nearly unchanged variation 10 for 300 m x 1200 m in fig 13a the main channel width increased significantly 100 near the two gcss and increased slightly 15 downstream of gcs 2 1500 m x 3000 m fig 13b shows that the cross sectional area of the main channel generally increased in the studied river reach in which the maximum area enlargement 200 occurred near the renmin canal and the two gcss due to significant bed degradation and channel widening fig 13c indicates that the width depth ratio of the main channel generally decreased upstream of the gcs 1 x 1200 m due to the significant bed degradation induced by the gcs dysfunction fig 12 while that near the gcs 2 increased slightly as the channel widened at both sides of gcs 2 as shown in fig 10 in fig 13c the width depth ratio of the main channel in the river reach downstream of gcs 2 1500 m x 3000 m was nearly unchanged 5 discussion the results presented in section 4 of this paper indicate that the bed erosion around gcs 1 and gcs 2 significantly widened and shifted the main channel leading to extensive bed degradation upstream of gcs 1 thus the bed morpho dynamic process in the area around gcs 1 and gcs 2 is critical to the failure of grade control and needs to be analysed in detail this section is a discussion of the reasons for failure of gcs 1 and gcs 2 based on the numerical flow modelling results described in section 3 2 of this paper fig 14 depicts the depth averaged velocity and the distribution of shear stress in the area around gcs 1 and gcs 2 based on the dem obtained on may 29 2020 before the flood season and peak flow 1300 m3 s the shear stress τ is calculated as 1 τ γ h s w where γ is the weight density of water n m3 h is the water depth on each calculation grid cell m s w is the water surface slope i e the vertical difference in the water surface divided by the horizontal distance fig 14a indicates that the mainstream flow was skewed to the left floodplain about 40 when it passed gcs 1 and tended to erode the left floodplain which was protected by concrete revetment fig 2b in fig 14 the flow velocity and the shear stress increased significantly after dropping from the crest of gcs 1 maximum drop height 8 m leading to local scour on the downstream riverbed consequently the revetment on the left floodplain collapsed due to the local scour and the mainstream flow caused significant erosion on the left floodplain near gcs 1 figs 9 10 fig 14a shows that the flow shifted to approach the right floodplain after it passed gcs 1 creating a zone of high velocity and shear stress at the right side of gcs 2 as a result the shifted flow caused significant erosion at the right floodplain near gcs 2 fig 9 a video taken during the flood event confirms that the mainstream flow pattern is consistent to the numerical model results described above this video was uploaded as supplementary material and can be accessed through the link https figshare com s 3ea79198e1cceedc2e5c fig 15 presents the lateral distributions of bed elevation depth average velocity vda and shear stress τ at gcs 1 and gcs 2 before the failure of gcss in which z is the bed elevation and l is the lateral distance from the left bank fig 15a b indicate that vda and τ increased significantly after passing the crest of gcs 1 from about 5 m s and 200 pa to over 15 m s and 2000 pa respectively however as the right half of the riverbed downstream of gcs 1 was protected by a stilling basin fig 14 that can reduce the turbulence energy and adapt the velocity profile hoffmans and verheij 1997 the shear stress and velocity in this area dropped significantly after exiting the stilling basin from about 12 m s and 1200 pa to 3 6 m s and 160 pa respectively consequently the local scour was minimised and the bed level in this area was nearly unchanged as a result the revetment on the left floodplain collapsed and the mainstream flow caused significant erosion on the left floodplain near gcs 1 in fig 15b the water level downstream of gcs 1 was non uniform due to the strong fluctuation of the dropping flow fig 15c d show that the flow velocity and shear stress upstream and downstream of gcs 2 were nearly unchanged as the water level upstream z 537 m and downstream z 536 m of gcs 2 were nearly the same as the mainstream flow downstream of gcs 1 was shifted to approach the right floodplain fig 14a the flow velocity and shear stress on the right side 12 m s and 2000 pa were greater than those on the left side 2 m s and 100 pa of gcs 2 fig 15c d it should be noted that the present study only conducted a 2d numerical simulation the secondary flow pattern was unknown although it has considerable impacts on the bed morpho dynamic and local scour process at a gcs ben meftah and mossa 2006 2020 the secondary flow can affect the geometry of scour hole downstream of a gcs creating a greater scour depth at the channel bank than that at the channel centreline guan et al 2014 in a curved channel the secondary flow can increase the velocity at the outer bank increasing the erodibility of flow in this area guan et al 2016b thus to better understand the scour or bed morpho dynamic process around a gcs the secondary flow data are required for future studies 6 lessons and design recommendations the reported case study indicates that the morpho dynamic process in a large scale compound channel is much more complex than that in a single channel such that grade control design in large scale compound channels is more challenging and more factors e g the mainstream flow direction and the local scour downstream of a gcs need to be considered the bed degradation process in a compound channel is different from that in a single channel for a single channel the bed degradation usually develops across the whole width of the channel martín vide and andreatta 2006 2009 for a compound channel as the flow intensity in the main channel is generally greater than that on floodplains liu et al 2016 usually the bed degradation is initiated in the main channel as the main channel deepens based on our field observation in shi ting river the flow enters the main channel from the floodplain increasing the flow erodibility in the main channel fig 16 in a degrading compound channel a gcs with a crest nearly aligned with the floodplain built in the main channel same as that shown in fig 15 can cause a rise of the upstream water level to above the floodplain level fig 17 a as a result the flow passes the gcs through the floodplain and then drops to the downstream main channel inducing erosion on the floodplain fig 17b the mechanism described in fig 17 applies to the variation of cross sections near the two gcss presented in fig 15 if the gcs is built in a curved main channel the mainstream flow may be skewed fig 14a and near the gcs tends to erode the floodplain on the outer side of a curved in plan compound river channel as shown in fig 18 a if the gcs is built with a high crest level relative to the downstream bed level fig 15 the flow over the gcs may cause significant local scour downstream fig 18b leading to the collapse of the floodplain in the scoured area once the floodplain near the gcs has been eroded or has collapsed the mainstream flow may bypass the gcs through the eroded or collapsed area in this scenario the gcs is no longer capable of blocking the upstream sediment transport leading to the failure of grade control figs 11 12 the mechanism described in fig 18 applies to the massive erosion near the two gcss shown in fig 10 table 2 compared the present study with the documented cases of bed degradation from literature the comparison indicates that the bed degradation of the present study during one flood season is at the same order of those of the documented cases over a much longer period greater than 10 years for example pearl river in china degraded maximumly 11 29 m from 1990 to 2003 lu et al 2007 po river in north italy degraded maximumly 6 m from 1880 to 1990 s rinaldi et al 2005 rhône river in south france degraded maximumly 4 m from 1952 to 1990 petit et al 1996 the comparison in table 2 indicates that the bed degradation induced by gcs failure in compound channels develops much faster than those induced by sediment mining weir or dam construction and reafforestation the above analysis indicates that the stability of a floodplain is critical to the grade control in large scale compound channels based on the mechanisms described above we propose the following recommendations for gcs design in large scale compound channels 1 the gcs should be built in a straight main channel which is parallel to the channel bank 2 the floodplain near the gcs should be protected 3 a series of low head gcss are recommended instead of a single high drop gcs for reducing local scour and 4 countermeasures for local scour should be applied for each gcs 7 conclusions this paper describes a field study of a failure case of grade control in a large scale compound channel a 3 1 km long and 300 400 m wide reach of shi ting river in china comprising analysis of the reasons for failure and the impacts of two improperly designed grade control structures gcss on the river bed morphology based on the field data and numerical flow modelling results the field survey results indicate that the flood in 2020 caused massive erosion in the area around the two gcss maximum erosion depth 20 m erosion volume 692 888 m3 the numerical modelling results show that the mainstream flow upstream of the gcs was skewed as the main channel is curved tending to erode the floodplain protected by concrete revetment the numerical results also indicate that the flow accelerated after dropping from the gcs crest level 3 8 m above the downstream bed level significantly increasing the velocity and shear stress and causing local scour downstream of the gcs as a result the revetment on the floodplain failed and the mainstream flow caused significant erosion on the floodplain the flow bypassed the gcs through the eroded area of the floodplain leading to the dysfunction of the gcs consequently the channel upstream of the gcs significantly degraded maximum degradation depth 10 m erosion volume 644081 m3 and steepened from 3 to 5 5 due to the gcs dysfunction the width and cross sectional area of the main channel near the renmin canal and the gcss increased significantly the main channel width depth ratio generally decreased upstream of the gcss and was nearly unchanged downstream of the gcss for the reported case study it is apparent that erosion on the floodplain is a key reason for the dysfunction of the gcs it is concluded that grade control in large scale compound channels should consider the mainstream flow direction and the local scour downstream of a gcs which are factors that may cause massive erosion on the floodplain through comparing the present study with the documented cases of bed degradation from literature it is found that the bed degradation induced by gcs failure in compound channels develops much faster than those induced by sediment mining weir or dam construction and reafforestation based on the analysis of the reasons for failure of the reported case study design recommendations are proposed for grade control in large scale compound channels the present study is the first reported failure case of grade control in a large scale compound channel with detailed topography data before and after the flood period the findings of the present study have improved the understanding of the impacts of gcss on the bed morpho dynamic process in compound channels the presented prototype data is also valuable to the development of theoretical or numerical models for predicting the bed morphology of a compound channel after building gcss the analysed failure reasons of the present case have highlighted the important topics that need to be further investigated the proposed design recommendations can provide guidance for grade control in degrading compound channels credit authorship contribution statement lu wang supervision methodology formal analysis

3046,an extensive artificial water diversion project aimed at alleviating the shortage of ecological water in lakes can change the original hydrological and physicochemical states and further affect the structure and distribution of phytoplankton communities therefore it is important to fully evaluate the ecological restoration effect of the water diversion project on the water receiving area before implementing water replenishment for this purpose we developed an integrated model framework based on the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc and random forest rf we adopted a probability distribution method to address the uncertainty during model coupling this framework was implemented to simulate and predict the evolution of phytoplankton diversity in baiyangdian lake bl in china to solve the problem that the phytoplankton biodiversity in bl decreased especially in summer due to human activity the yellow river into bl the south to north water diversion project and joint replenishment of upstream reservoirs have been implemented in recent years our framework was used to analyze the biodiversity restoration effects of multi source water replenishment through different routings the results show that spatiotemporal coverage should be considered to reduce uncertainty during model coupling water replenishment has a positive impact on the biodiversity of bl however there are effective areas for phytoplankton diversity restoration which are related to water quality and quantity water replenishment routing and internal hydrological connectivity the xiaobai river has the most significant water ecological restoration potential among the routings compared with that of the baigou and fu rivers appropriate water replenishment in spring will play a vital role in alleviating the decrease in phytoplankton biodiversity in summer owing to flood control keywords water diversion project ecological restoration phytoplankton diversity integrated model baiyangdian lake data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with accelerated urbanization and a rapidly developing social economy increasing human activities have led to a sharp decline in regional biodiversity and the deterioration of aquatic ecosystems palmer and ruhi 2019 sellinger et al 2008 an increasing number of ecological protection and restoration projects such as water diversion tang et al 2018 and ecological dredging jing et al 2019 have been conducted to strengthen ecological and environmental management among them water diversion projects have been favored by river and lake managers because of the speed and effectiveness with which they relieve ecological water shortages and water quality deterioration such as with lake xuanwu song et al 2018 the south to north water transfer project he et al 2020 and water diversion from the yangtze river to lake taihu dai et al 2020 however water diversion projects also affect the ecosystems of aquatic organisms and change their community structure and distribution li et al 2020b in addition multi source water replenishment also increases the complexity of impacts therefore it is important to fully evaluate the ecological restoration effect of the multi source water diversion project on the water receiving area before implementing water replenishment phytoplankton as a component of aquatic ecosystems quickly respond to habitat changes and play an essential role in reflecting ecosystem integrity yang et al 2017 community structure can also be used as an appropriate indicator to characterize the evolution of aquatic ecosystems caused by external disturbances dai et al 2020 the shannon wienner index is a comprehensive index commonly used to characterize the phytoplankton community structure it considers species abundance and richness and can represent the overall characteristics of the phytoplankton community structure mallinis et al 2020 water replenishment can shorten the lake residence time li et al 2011 and alter lake currents which can influence the transportation transformation and distribution of nutrients and biological communities in certain small lakes amano et al 2010 dai et al 2020 however for large lakes the residence time is generally very long and the lake residence time cannot be significantly shortened by a limited inflow discharge of any water diversion dai et al 2020 moreover water replenishment can improve water quality hu et al 2008 li et al 2011 in oligotrophic lakes exogenous nutrients may also be introduced to aggravate eutrophication through water diversion thereby affecting the phytoplankton community structures li et al 2011 in addition allochthonous phytoplankton species from rivers can directly affect phytoplankton communities in lakes dai et al 2020 the impact of water replenishment on aquatic communities has been discussed at length however optimization and prediction of the effects of lake biodiversity restoration under different water replenishment schemes remains an issue where mathematical models could be useful models enable virtual experiments meyer et al 2009 to be conducted and they are efficient tools for examining ecological questions elliott et al 2000 there are two general models process based pb and data driven dd methods rousso et al 2020 pb methods quantify known principles theories and empirical knowledge of ecology biochemistry and physics using a set of mathematical equations the relationship between phytoplankton and environmental factors is complex currently pb methods are used to study the relationship between several algae types cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms and environmental factors bucak et al 2018 chen et al 2014 however owing to the limitations of current cognition and the complexity of physical chemical and biological interactions in the ecosystem it is difficult to employ a model that fully represents the phytoplankton community structure zeng et al 2017 dd methods are based on data mining algorithms or statistical techniques to analyze and identify patterns in measuring data or to create predictive rules relevant to plankton community dynamics which is another widely used tool jovem azevêdo et al 2020 tamvakis et al 2014 zeng et al 2017 compared with that of pb methods the advantage of dd methods is that they require less prior knowledge in the development process and a previous understanding of potential phenomena relevant to them can improve their performance by optimizing input variable selection rousso et al 2020 however the disadvantage of dd models is that not all outputs are physically or chemically interpretable therefore coupling pb and dd models and utilizing their respective advantages to evaluate and predict the evolution process of the water ecosystem has gradually been applied jin et al 2021 park et al 2015 simultaneously coupling pb and dd models introduces new problems the output of the pb model is generally the input condition of the dd model however data transfer between different model systems will cause uncertainty even if the model system is aimed at the same research object qian and reckhow 2007 therefore how to solve the uncertainty during model coupling requires further investigation taking the baiyangdian ecological water diversion project in china as an example this study established an integrated model framework based on the pb the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc and dd models random forest rf a probability distribution method was proposed to address the uncertainty in the data transmission process during model coupling the framework was used to predict and analyze the response of phytoplankton diversity to different water replenishment schemes in baiyangdian lake bl aiming to determine the time space difference of the ecological restoration effect of water replenishment and its leading reasons and to guide the formulation and optimization of aquatic ecological restoration 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling sites bl 38 43 39 02 n 115 38 116 07 e a polymictic lake located in the center of hebei province china where is a warm temperate

1637 mm respectively zhuang et al 2011 precipitation varies substantially from year to year and approximately 89 7 of the rainfall occurs from may to october zhang et al 2022 in the flood season august the dominant species of phytoplankton in baiyangdian lake are mainly cyanophyta and chlorophyta mainly including microcystis aeruginosa merismopedia tenuissima and anabaena oscillarioides indicating that bl is in a state of moderate pollution during the non flood season may chlorophyta and bacillariophyta are the majority including crucigenia quadrata scenedesmus dimorphus and synedra acus indicating that bl is in a state of light pollution li et al 2020a because of the significant role it plays in water supply flood diversion commercial fishing tourism recreation as well as providing great conservational value to its wildlife and wetland vegetation the lake has become known as the pearl of north china muqi et al 1998 however flows are intercepted by the upstream construction of dams and reservoirs thus bl has suffered considerably from surface area shrinkage and a decline in the water level since the 1950s yi et al 2019 with the reduction in marginal zones the lake has completely disappeared four times in the past six decades wang et al 2010 low water levels are deadly threats to aquatic species moreover these problems are aggravated by human activity wang et al 2013 water abuse and waste in the agricultural industrial and domestic sectors have negatively influenced the water supply and dramatically decreased the water level of bl without reliable tributary subsidiaries the shallow lake dries up with a water level below bottom elevation liu et al 2006 to restore the ecosystem health of the lake system 15 water releases from the inner and or inter basin sources e g the upstream reservoirs and yellow river were undertaken where the transferred water volumes ranged from 1 2 107 to 1 5 108 m3 between 1981 and 2010 lv et al 2013 with the construction of the xiongan new area in 2017 the relevant departments have increased ecological water replenishment in bl to date bl has been involved in multi water resource replenishment including the yellow river into bl the south to north water diversion project and joint replenishment of upstream reservoirs yi et al 2020 among them the joint replenishment of upstream reservoirs is from the xiaoyi river bao river fu river and baigou river the south to north water diversion project is supplied from the baigou river the yellow river into bl is supplied from the xiaobai river and the zhaowangxin river is the only outflow in bl six sampling sites s1 s6 were selected as representative sites for bl the locations of these sites are shown in fig 1 environmental monitoring and phytoplankton sampling were performed in may spring and october autumn 2017 august summer 2018 june summer 2019 and july summer and october autumn 2020 2 2 sample collection and data analysis a portable multi parameter measuring instrument hq30d hach shanghai china was used to measure the water temperature and dissolved oxygen do in situ total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and the permanganate index codmn were determined in the laboratory a quantitative water quality analysis was performed using a 1 l sterile plastic bottle 50 cm below the surface for qualitative analysis of phytoplankton surface water samples were collected using a 25 plankton net and the collected phytoplankton were placed into 100 ml sample bottles which were immediately fixed with 3 ml formalin and taken to the laboratory for analysis for quantitative analysis of phytoplankton a plexiglass water collector collected a 1 l water sample 0 5 m below the surface and placed it into the sample bottle next the sample was fixed with 15 ml of luger s reagent and shaken well after standing for 48 h the supernatant was aspirated and concentrated to 30 ml and a plankton counting box was used to count it phytoplankton samples were examined using zeiss axio lab a1 zeiss axio imager m2 and olympus cx23 inverted microscope 200 magnification and identified to the species level the shannon wienner index h of each sample was calculated using primer e software quest research limited auckland new zealand the following formula was used h p i ln p i where pi ni n pi is the ratio of the number of individuals of the ith species to the total number of individuals ni is the total number of individuals of the ith species and n is the total number of species 2 3 integrated modeling framework of efdc and rf considering spatiotemporal coverage to predict and analyze the response of phytoplankton diversity to water replenishment an integrated framework was developed based on the pb efdc and dd rf models the efdc simulation yielded values of the environmental variables under different water replenishment schemes and the rf model established the response relationship between environmental variables and phytoplankton diversity the shannon wienner index h under different water replenishment schemes was derived by integrating efdc and rf model in addition the uncertainty was considered when the efdc output was transmitted to the rf model as the input condition the framework of this integrated model was shown in fig 2 2 3 1 efdc modeling the efdc is a comprehensive three dimensional numerical model that has been widely used in a wide range of environmental studies including simulations of hydrodynamics thermal stratification water age transport lagrangian particle tracers and eutrophication processes in rivers lakes estuaries reservoirs wetlands and coastal regions gong et al 2009 li et al 2013 zeng et al 2015 the main governing equations are presented in the supplementary information a high resolution cartesian grid was developed for bl fig s1 a the computational domain had a spatial resolution of 100 100 m in the vertical direction the sigma coordinate was applied and each cell was divided into four even layers fig s1 b shows the boundary and corresponding underwater terrain of bl the model simulation was implemented with a 10 s constant time step which was proven to be appropriate for guaranteeing model precision and stability in this study hydrometeorological data measured from april 1 2015 to may 31 2015 were chosen for model calibration april 1 2015 april 30 2015 and verification may 1 2015 may 31 2015 the water quality data measured from may 1 2020 to june 30 2020 were chosen for model calibration may 1 2020 may 31 2020 and verification june 1 2020 june 30 2020 the results of calibration validation are presented in fig s3 and fig s4 the water quality indicators used to establish the efdc model were do codmn tn and tp the root mean square error rmse and nash efficiency coefficient nse were used to evaluate simulation accuracy the calculation formulas for the two indicators are as follows rmse i 1 n o i p i 2 n nse 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where o i and p i represent the sample of size n containing observations and model estimates respectively o is the mean of the observed values 2 3 2 random forest rf modeling as an ensemble learning method the rf is a combination of tree predictors each tree in the rf was constructed using a different bootstrap sample of the data and each node was split using the best among a subset of predictors randomly chosen at that node which could strongly reduce the correlation among trees to improve model performance wang and chen 2020 the final results were determined by majority votes for classification or averages for regression of all the trees in the rf this method is unaffected by excessive parameterization in nature and has been widely used as a meaningful method for predicting phytoplankton species richness in temperate lakes catherine et al 2016 mallinis et al 2020 wu and liang 2018 there are two ways to evaluate the ranking of the most important predictive variables in rf models increment in the mean of squared residuals msr and node purity béjaoui et al 2018 the first is computed by permuting the out of bag oob data and for each tree the prediction error on the oob portion of the data is recorded the same is done after permuting each predictor variable the differences between the two were then averaged over all trees and normalized to the standard deviation of the differences strobl et al 2008 the second is the total decrease in node impurities i e the variance from splitting on the variable averaged over all trees béjaoui et al 2018 both techniques are widely used in ecology and statistics and there are no fixed criteria to select the best ranking method béjaoui et al 2016 we used node purity to evaluate the importance ranking of predictive variables in the rf model the response and predictive variables were the measured water environmental factors and the phytoplankton shannon wienner index respectively the predictive accuracy of the rf model was evaluated through 5 fold cross validation supplementary information the r2 and nse values were used to evaluate the predictive power of the model model runs were performed with r software version 4 0 1 using the random forest package liaw and wiener 2018 2 3 3 spatiotemporal uncertainty processing for integrated models to solve the uncertainty caused during data transmission between coupled models considering that most pb models can obtain the continuous spatiotemporal variation of water body indicators we can select water body indicators in a certain spatiotemporal range and input them into the rf model to drive the prediction of the dd model the size of this spatiotemporal range is called spatiotemporal coverage appropriate spatiotemporal coverage can also ensure that the prediction results of the coupled model are representative to ensure the appropriate spatiotemporal coverage we analyzed the influence of different time coverages on the output of the coupled model and proposed a method based on a probability distribution to determine the appropriate spatiotemporal coverage of the coupling model the adjusted multiple decision coefficient r a 2 and absolute error ae were selected as the two indicators to measure the suitability of the temporal and spatial coverage for spatial coverage we selected 16 adjacent grids with a resolution of 100 m 100 m fig 3 a on the premise of the same spatial coverage we selected four groups of different time coverage schemes 5 10 15 and 30 days fig 3 b we calculated all diversity indexes h under four groups of different spatiotemporal coverage by the coupling model and constructed frequency distribution diagrams of h and the corresponding frequency n under different spatiotemporal coverage fig 3 c finally we made extensive use of r a 2 and ae between h i a v e and measured h to determine the appropriate spatiotemporal coverage fig 3 d h i a v e and ae were calculated as follows h i ave j n ij n i h ij ae h i ave h i r a 2 1 1 r 2 n 1 n k 1 where hij is the h of frequency j in the ith scheme nij is the frequency corresponding to whose h is hij ni is the total sample size obtained by the ith scheme h i is h obtained from measured data ae is the ae between h i and h i a v e r a 2 is the adjusted multiple coefficient of determination r is the multiple coefficient of determination n is the number of samples and k is the number of independent variables 2 4 scenario setting the effect of water replenishment on biodiversity in baiyangdian lake the efdc was used to simulate the chemical and physical parameter distributions under different replenishment scenarios in bl and the model was run for 275 days from march to november based on data availability because the surface water of bl freezes in winter from december to february the rf model was used to predict the distribution of phytoplankton shannon wienner index h based on the efdc simulation results by predicting the phytoplankton biodiversity distribution under different water replenishment schemes we aimed to analyze the time space differences in the ecological restoration effect of water replenishment and its leading reasons and to guide the formulation and optimization of aquatic ecological restoration according to the actual situation of ecological water replenishment in bl in recent years four ecological water replenishment schemes with different water flows have been established the monthly flow changes in bl under different water replenishment schemes are shown in fig 4 the quantity of reclaimed water remained unchanged under all four water replenishment schemes in contrast under the four ecological water replenishment schemes the water replenishment of the yellow river and south to north water diversion projects increased successively from non replenishment to high flow replenishment with a gradient of 350 million m3 year the water quality boundary conditions for each scheme are presented in fig s2 3 results 3 1 physical and chemical indices of water body and shannon wienner index according to the chemical and physical parameters and shannon wienner index h of bl from 2017 to 2020 there were significant spatiotemporal differences at different sampling points and in different periods from the perspective of temporal variation do tn and tp were significantly different however codmn and h showed little change fig 5 tp began to decrease after reaching a peak of 0 16 mg l in 2018 whereas tn began to decrease after reaching a peak of 2 74 mg l in 2019 indicating that a series of government measures implemented in bl in recent years such as the ecological water diversion silt removal and dismantle the cofferdam projects have played a positive role however unlike do tp tn and other indicators the biodiversity indices h and codmn showed no significant changes with water quality indicators during the sampling period on the one hand it indicates that the water diversion project is slow to restore water ecology and it is necessary to continuously monitor the future chemical and physical parameters and water ecology to assess the impact of the water diversion project on the other hand it also indicates that the current treatment measures did not effectively reduce the concentration of organic pollutants in bl in the future the source of organic pollutants in bl should be analyzed to implement more effective measures to reduce the concentration of organic pollutants in addition the sampling results showed that the h of bl showed an apparent decreasing trend in october 2020 which may be caused by the combined effect of low nutrient concentration and low temperature from the perspective of spatial variation the nutrient concentration in the northern part of bl was higher than that in the southern part and the phytoplankton biodiversity in the central area of bl s2 s3 s4 was lower than that in other locations fig 6 the dominant species in the central area of bl and other area are mainly cyanobacteria and chlorophyta table s5 mainly including anabaena oscillarioides merismopedia tenuissima microcystis aeruginosa crucigenia tetrapedia and scenedesmus dimorphus etc and the average phytoplankton cell density in baiyangdian lake is 34 20 106 ind l of which the phytoplankton cell density in the center area is 32 46 106 ind l and the phytoplankton cell density in the rest area is 36 32 106 ind l therefore the phytoplankton cell density in the center area of bl was also lower than that in the rest fig s5 the fu river northwest of bl receives wastewater from baoding city and carries pollutants generated upstream into bl however the southern part of bl is further from the source of the fu river than the northern part which is less affected by the fu river therefore the nutrient concentration in the northern part of bl is generally higher than that in the southern part codmn did not show the more in the south and less in the north distribution pattern similar to nutrient concentration however it was roughly evenly distributed in bl indicating that the organic pollutants represented by codmn concentration were not transported by the fu river but may be produced by the baiyangdian aquatic ecological environment phytoplankton communities are generally affected by temperature do and nutrients tang et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 therefore the low concentration of nutrients and do in the central area of bl is a key factor that lowers its biodiversity 3 2 establishment and validation of rf model the validation results of the rf model are presented in table s1 and fig 7 pearson correlation coefficient r2 and nse were used to evaluate the rf model performance the results showed that the r2 of the predicted and measured data was 0 912 and the nse was 0 758 indicating that the model performed well ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 therefore the rf model based on chemical and physical parameters can be used as a reliable phytoplankton community prediction tool for bl fig 8 shows that do was the most significant environmental factor affecting phytoplankton biodiversity among all chemical and physical parameters studies have found that do is closely related to the growth and death of phytoplankton communities li et al 2018 and that low do concentrations may lead to a decrease in phytoplankton species and biodiversity zhang et al 2018 in previous studies on bl do was also an important environmental factor affecting phytoplankton biodiversity tang et al 2019 water temperature and tp were also critical environmental factors affecting phytoplankton biodiversity fig 8 previous studies have shown that phytoplankton species richness increases linearly as the temperature gradually increases to 19 c catherine et al 2016 therefore water temperature plays a critical role in the growth and reproduction of phytoplankton liu et al 2016 which is an important factor driving seasonal variation in phytoplankton biodiversity and a key environmental factor affecting phytoplankton community composition shi et al 2020 concurrently the increase in tp concentration also decreases phytoplankton species richness increases phytoplankton dominance yang et al 2021 and changes the nutrient structure of water jeppesen et al 2000 existing studies on bl have also found that water temperature and tp are critical environmental factors affecting phytoplankton biodiversity tang et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 3 3 establishment and validation of a hydrodynamic water quality model 3 3 1 verification of the hydrodynamic part the parameter values and data sources for the efdc model are listed in table s2 according to the daily water level verification results of s6 station fig s3 the ae between simulated and measured water level values is in the range of 0 02 0 03 m rmse is 0 008 m and nse is 0 88 the results show that the model accurately reflects the water level fluctuation and is suitable for hydrodynamic process simulation of bl 3 3 2 verification of the water quality part the initial conditions and main chemical and physical parameters are listed in table s3 based on the validation results obtained at sampling point s4 fig s4 the nse of each chemical and physical parameter in 2020 is 0 70 and the simulation results can better reflect the change process of water quality in the simulated area this shows that the water quality model of bl can be used to simulate water quality under different water replenishment scenarios 3 4 establishment and validation of the efdc and rf coupling model the predicted biodiversity at s3 sampling site in july is shown in fig 9 it can be seen that the h distribution of phytoplankton in the bl is relatively dispersed under different time coverages ranging from 1 7 to 2 3 fig 9 a d therefore when the output result of the pb model is transmitted to the dd model as the input condition the water quality simulation results at a particular site and point in time cannot be taken because it cannot represent the water ecological status of the research area during that period under the premise of considering certain spatial coverage we obtained h indices of different time coverages of 1 913 1 899 1 884 and 1 850 and the ae between simulated values and measured values was 0 038 0 101 table 1 the results show that the coupling model is suitable for the simulation of hydrodynamic water quality and phytoplankton biodiversity in bl and the prediction accuracy of the coupling model is preferable to that of the previous dd model tamvakis et al 2014 when the time coverage was 30 days the overall characteristics of h in the simulated area were not obvious r2 0 55 which indicates that it was difficult to obtain the overall characteristics of h in the simulated area after 30 days of time coverage when the time coverage decreased to 15 days the overall characteristics of h in the simulated area were obvious r2 0 67 when the time coverage continues to decrease the overall characteristics of h in the simulated area tend to be stable which means that when the time coverage decreases to 10 days or less the overall characteristics of the simulated h index are relatively stable however decreasing the time coverage did not effectively improve the regularity of the simulated data r2 0 70 simultaneously it can be seen that a longer time coverage 30 days also leads to a sizeable ae of the prediction results table 1 therefore to ensure the stability of the overall characteristics and accuracy of the prediction results the time coverage should be 10 15 days in the subsequent scenario analysis in section 3 5 the selected time coverage was 15 days 3 5 scenario analysis based on water replenishment in baiyangdian lake the phytoplankton biodiversity results in the simulated area of bl from march to november under the four ecological water replenishment schemes are shown in fig 10 in each sub graph the vertical and horizontal axes represent the phytoplankton biodiversity index h and location label of the simulated area respectively therefore each row represents the annual variation in phytoplankton diversity in the simulated area of bl affected by the same river under the different water replenishment schemes each column represents the phytoplankton diversity in the simulated baiyangdian area affected by different rivers during the same month under different water refill schemes overall our predictions suggest that water replenishment has a positive effect on the biodiversity of bl however the effect is determined by the water quality of both water replenishment and water receiving areas when the area where the water quality of water replenishment is better than that of the water receiving area fu river the effect of low flow water replenishment is mainly manifested as dilution under which the significant improvement of water quality is conducive to improved biodiversity fig 10 c and d however in areas with little difference between the water quality of water replenishment and water receiving areas xiaobai river and baigou river water receiving areas low flow water replenishment inhibits the improvement in phytoplankton biodiversity this is because the dilution effect was not obvious and the effect of water replenishment is represented more by the disturbance of the water column in the water receiving area which results in nutrient release from sediment zeng et al 2015 the above phenomenon only occurred in the low flow water replenishment scheme while the biodiversity of the three rivers increased with the increase in water replenishment flow in the medium and high flow water replenishment schemes fig 10 b h and j in addition the results showed that there were significant spatiotemporal differences in the restoration effect of water replenishment on biodiversity from the perspective of spatial variation there was an effective area for the restoration effect of water replenishment on biodiversity the results showed that under different water replenishment schemes water replenishment through the fu river and baigou river had a limited impact on the biodiversity of bl even increasing the flow in contrast the increase in water replenishment flow of the xiaobai river is positively correlated with the increase in biodiversity the influence range expands significantly which is manifested as point b c and d at the edges of the influence ranges of low medium and high flow respectively fig 10 h in addition the biodiversity of the center of bl was unaffected by water replenishment in the four water replenishment schemes simulation areas 6 and 7 and simulation area d fig 10 d h and j from the perspective of temporal variation phytoplankton biodiversity showed a seasonal variation pattern of high in winter and spring and low in summer and autumn in bl under different water replenishment schemes and routing fig 10 and the phytoplankton biodiversity index h was at the lowest value in summer 4 discussion 4 1 effect of water replenishment on biodiversity in baiyangdian lake the effects of water replenishment on the phytoplankton diversity in lacustrine ecosystems has been reported in many previous studies fornarelli et al 2013 li et al 2013 dai et al 2020 most of these studies have observed an increase in the diversity in water receiving aquatic ecosystems li et al 2013 dai et al 2020 our study also found water replenishment had a positive effect on the biodiversity of bl in addition the results indicated no positive correlation between the quantity of replenished water and biodiversity it was found that when the volume of diluted water was almost equal to the volume of the lake the water quality improved due to the flushing of diluted water welch and patmont 1980 the water quantity of the medium and high flow water replenishment schemes is approximately 400 600 million m3 which is almost equal to the lake s storage however in these two water replenishment schemes biodiversity did not increase with increasing water quantity therefore the effect of increasing water quantity on improving biodiversity is limited 4 2 spatial difference of multi source water replenishment in baiyangdian lake the result showed that there is an effective area for the restoration effect of water replenishment on biodiversity and similar findings dai et al 2020 zeng et al 2015 were found in previous studies in addition to the water quality and quantity we also found that the effective area was related to water replenishment routing and internal hydrological connectivity of bl the results showed that under different water replenishment schemes the edges of the impact range through the fu river on the biodiversity of bl were limited in simulated area 3 fig 10 a and b which was caused by the poor hydrological connectivity between the northwest part of bl and its central area with only a narrow river connection sun et al 2022 in contrast the xiaobai river has comprehensive water replenishment routing and is directly connected to the central area of bl with good hydrological connectivity therefore increasing the flow can significantly increase its water ecological impact the baigou river is similar to the fu river which shows that when the replenishment flow increases to a certain extent the range of water ecological influence cannot be significantly increased this is because villages between simulated areas c and d in bl weakened the hydrological connectivity between the baigou river water replenishment channel and the central area of bl resulting in a poor water replenishment effect fig 10 i and l in conclusion compared with the baigou and fu rivers the xiaobai river has the most significant potential for the ecological restoration of bl however attention must also be given to the ecological restoration of the fu and baigou river in local areas considering the existence of an effective area in different water replenishment channels multiple water replenishment routes can be adapted to maximize the overall ecological restoration benefits on the premise that the total water quantity is determined 4 3 seasonal difference of multi source water replenishment in baiyangdian lake the seasonal variation in phytoplankton biodiversity in bl is primarily driven by temperature and nutrients studies have shown that high temperatures in summer inhibit phytoplankton biodiversity to a certain extent catherine et al 2016 this is responsible for the high in winter and spring and low in summer and autumn seasonal variation pattern in phytoplankton biodiversity in bl fig 10 this trend is evident in the entire bl area unlike temperature the effect of nutrients on phytoplankton biodiversity is limited within the effective area the lowest biodiversity in summer was not only found in bl but also found in other lakes zhu et al 2020 a summer peak is generally accompanied by this phenomenon in phytoplankton density or chl a concentration zhu et al 2020 this is because the overgrowth of blue green algae combined with temperature and nutrients occupies the ecological niche of other algae resulting in low biodiversity and high density of phytoplankton in summer therefore it is important to improve phytoplankton biodiversity in estival bl and inhibit the excessive growth of blue green algae because of flood risk ecological water replenishment is generally not conducted in july and august therefore it is not feasible to improve phytoplankton biodiversity in summer through water replenishment the results showed that water replenishment in spring can improve phytoplankton biodiversity in early summer fig 10 c and k moreover compared with oligotrophic areas such as the xiaobai and baigou rivers the phenomenon was more evident in the fu river and other eutrophic areas hence implementing ecological water replenishment in spring can effectively reduce the risk of phytoplankton diversity reduction and algal blooms in the summer 4 4 advantages and applications of the integrated framework in water replenishment management first of all our framework based on a well validation model is able to predict by combining the advantages of the pb model and dd model the ecological restoration effect of water replenishment considering the uncertainty in the data transmission using a method based on probability distribution to select appropriate spatiotemporal coverage improves the prediction accuracy a series of simulation scenarios were designed through the framework to determine the temporal and spatial differences of the ecological restoration effect of water replenishment and its leading reasons to guide the ecological management of bl secondly the previous prediction models for phytoplankton mostly used chlorophyll or algal density as the predictor liu et al 2015 zeng et al 2017 harris and graham 2017 while our framework uses the shannon wienner index h to focus on the change of community structure through our framework the impact of environmental factor changes on phytoplankton biodiversity can be directly obtained finally efdc has been widely used in various aquatic ecosystems wang and boegman 2021 zhang et al 2021 also rf models have been widely used to predict phytoplankton biomass liu et al 2015 zeng et al 2017 harris and graham 2017 therefore the developed framework for predicting diversity is not limited to baiyangdian lake which can be easily transferred to other aquatic ecosystems to provide guidance for formulating and optimizing water replenishment schemes for ecological restoration purposes 5 conclusion this study established a prediction model for determining the impact of a water diversion project on phytoplankton biodiversity the following conclusions were drawn 1 it is necessary to consider spatiotemporal coverage to reduce uncertainty during model coupling the prediction result will be unrepresentative if spatiotemporal coverage is not adequately accounted for when the time coverage is 10 15 days the overall characteristics of h can be effectively obtained and the prediction accuracy can be guaranteed 2 the integrated model can predict the ecological restoration effect of water replenishment and guide the ecological management of bl water replenishment has a positive effect on bl biodiversity in addition the effect is determined by the water quality of both the water replenishment and water receiving areas there are effective areas for the restoration of biodiversity of water replenishment which is related to water quality and quantity water replenishment paths and internal hydrological connectivity compared with the baigou and fu rivers the xiaobai river has the most significant potential for aquatic ecological restoration appropriate water replenishment in spring is crucial for alleviating the decrease in phytoplankton biodiversity caused by flood control in summer credit authorship contribution statement bowen sun writing original draft guoyu wang conceptualization

3046,an extensive artificial water diversion project aimed at alleviating the shortage of ecological water in lakes can change the original hydrological and physicochemical states and further affect the structure and distribution of phytoplankton communities therefore it is important to fully evaluate the ecological restoration effect of the water diversion project on the water receiving area before implementing water replenishment for this purpose we developed an integrated model framework based on the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc and random forest rf we adopted a probability distribution method to address the uncertainty during model coupling this framework was implemented to simulate and predict the evolution of phytoplankton diversity in baiyangdian lake bl in china to solve the problem that the phytoplankton biodiversity in bl decreased especially in summer due to human activity the yellow river into bl the south to north water diversion project and joint replenishment of upstream reservoirs have been implemented in recent years our framework was used to analyze the biodiversity restoration effects of multi source water replenishment through different routings the results show that spatiotemporal coverage should be considered to reduce uncertainty during model coupling water replenishment has a positive impact on the biodiversity of bl however there are effective areas for phytoplankton diversity restoration which are related to water quality and quantity water replenishment routing and internal hydrological connectivity the xiaobai river has the most significant water ecological restoration potential among the routings compared with that of the baigou and fu rivers appropriate water replenishment in spring will play a vital role in alleviating the decrease in phytoplankton biodiversity in summer owing to flood control keywords water diversion project ecological restoration phytoplankton diversity integrated model baiyangdian lake data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with accelerated urbanization and a rapidly developing social economy increasing human activities have led to a sharp decline in regional biodiversity and the deterioration of aquatic ecosystems palmer and ruhi 2019 sellinger et al 2008 an increasing number of ecological protection and restoration projects such as water diversion tang et al 2018 and ecological dredging jing et al 2019 have been conducted to strengthen ecological and environmental management among them water diversion projects have been favored by river and lake managers because of the speed and effectiveness with which they relieve ecological water shortages and water quality deterioration such as with lake xuanwu song et al 2018 the south to north water transfer project he et al 2020 and water diversion from the yangtze river to lake taihu dai et al 2020 however water diversion projects also affect the ecosystems of aquatic organisms and change their community structure and distribution li et al 2020b in addition multi source water replenishment also increases the complexity of impacts therefore it is important to fully evaluate the ecological restoration effect of the multi source water diversion project on the water receiving area before implementing water replenishment phytoplankton as a component of aquatic ecosystems quickly respond to habitat changes and play an essential role in reflecting ecosystem integrity yang et al 2017 community structure can also be used as an appropriate indicator to characterize the evolution of aquatic ecosystems caused by external disturbances dai et al 2020 the shannon wienner index is a comprehensive index commonly used to characterize the phytoplankton community structure it considers species abundance and richness and can represent the overall characteristics of the phytoplankton community structure mallinis et al 2020 water replenishment can shorten the lake residence time li et al 2011 and alter lake currents which can influence the transportation transformation and distribution of nutrients and biological communities in certain small lakes amano et al 2010 dai et al 2020 however for large lakes the residence time is generally very long and the lake residence time cannot be significantly shortened by a limited inflow discharge of any water diversion dai et al 2020 moreover water replenishment can improve water quality hu et al 2008 li et al 2011 in oligotrophic lakes exogenous nutrients may also be introduced to aggravate eutrophication through water diversion thereby affecting the phytoplankton community structures li et al 2011 in addition allochthonous phytoplankton species from rivers can directly affect phytoplankton communities in lakes dai et al 2020 the impact of water replenishment on aquatic communities has been discussed at length however optimization and prediction of the effects of lake biodiversity restoration under different water replenishment schemes remains an issue where mathematical models could be useful models enable virtual experiments meyer et al 2009 to be conducted and they are efficient tools for examining ecological questions elliott et al 2000 there are two general models process based pb and data driven dd methods rousso et al 2020 pb methods quantify known principles theories and empirical knowledge of ecology biochemistry and physics using a set of mathematical equations the relationship between phytoplankton and environmental factors is complex currently pb methods are used to study the relationship between several algae types cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms and environmental factors bucak et al 2018 chen et al 2014 however owing to the limitations of current cognition and the complexity of physical chemical and biological interactions in the ecosystem it is difficult to employ a model that fully represents the phytoplankton community structure zeng et al 2017 dd methods are based on data mining algorithms or statistical techniques to analyze and identify patterns in measuring data or to create predictive rules relevant to plankton community dynamics which is another widely used tool jovem azevêdo et al 2020 tamvakis et al 2014 zeng et al 2017 compared with that of pb methods the advantage of dd methods is that they require less prior knowledge in the development process and a previous understanding of potential phenomena relevant to them can improve their performance by optimizing input variable selection rousso et al 2020 however the disadvantage of dd models is that not all outputs are physically or chemically interpretable therefore coupling pb and dd models and utilizing their respective advantages to evaluate and predict the evolution process of the water ecosystem has gradually been applied jin et al 2021 park et al 2015 simultaneously coupling pb and dd models introduces new problems the output of the pb model is generally the input condition of the dd model however data transfer between different model systems will cause uncertainty even if the model system is aimed at the same research object qian and reckhow 2007 therefore how to solve the uncertainty during model coupling requires further investigation taking the baiyangdian ecological water diversion project in china as an example this study established an integrated model framework based on the pb the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc and dd models random forest rf a probability distribution method was proposed to address the uncertainty in the data transmission process during model coupling the framework was used to predict and analyze the response of phytoplankton diversity to different water replenishment schemes in baiyangdian lake bl aiming to determine the time space difference of the ecological restoration effect of water replenishment and its leading reasons and to guide the formulation and optimization of aquatic ecological restoration 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling sites bl 38 43 39 02 n 115 38 116 07 e a polymictic lake located in the center of hebei province china where is a warm temperate continental monsoon climate has an area of 366 km2 fig 1 it is 39 5 km from east to west and 28 5 km from north to south yang et al 2018 the average annual precipitation and evaporation are 550 mm and 1637 mm respectively zhuang et al 2011 precipitation varies substantially from year to year and approximately 89 7 of the rainfall occurs from may to october zhang et al 2022 in the flood season august the dominant species of phytoplankton in baiyangdian lake are mainly cyanophyta and chlorophyta mainly including microcystis aeruginosa merismopedia tenuissima and anabaena oscillarioides indicating that bl is in a state of moderate pollution during the non flood season may chlorophyta and bacillariophyta are the majority including crucigenia quadrata scenedesmus dimorphus and synedra acus indicating that bl is in a state of light pollution li et al 2020a because of the significant role it plays in water supply flood diversion commercial fishing tourism recreation as well as providing great conservational value to its wildlife and wetland vegetation the lake has become known as the pearl of north china muqi et al 1998 however flows are intercepted by the upstream construction of dams and reservoirs thus bl has suffered considerably from surface area shrinkage and a decline in the water level since the 1950s yi et al 2019 with the reduction in marginal zones the lake has completely disappeared four times in the past six decades wang et al 2010 low water levels are deadly threats to aquatic species moreover these problems are aggravated by human activity wang et al 2013 water abuse and waste in the agricultural industrial and domestic sectors have negatively influenced the water supply and dramatically decreased the water level of bl without reliable tributary subsidiaries the shallow lake dries up with a water level below bottom elevation liu et al 2006 to restore the ecosystem health of the lake system 15 water releases from the inner and or inter basin sources e g the upstream reservoirs and yellow river were undertaken where the transferred water volumes ranged from 1 2 107 to 1 5 108 m3 between 1981 and 2010 lv et al 2013 with the construction of the xiongan new area in 2017 the relevant departments have increased ecological water replenishment in bl to date bl has been involved in multi water resource replenishment including the yellow river into bl the south to north water diversion project and joint replenishment of upstream reservoirs yi et al 2020 among them the joint replenishment of upstream reservoirs is from the xiaoyi river bao river fu river and baigou river the south to north water diversion project is supplied from the baigou river the yellow river into bl is supplied from the xiaobai river and the zhaowangxin river is the only outflow in bl six sampling sites s1 s6 were selected as representative sites for bl the locations of these sites are shown in fig 1 environmental monitoring and phytoplankton sampling were performed in may spring and october autumn 2017 august summer 2018 june summer 2019 and july summer and october autumn 2020 2 2 sample collection and data analysis a portable multi parameter measuring instrument hq30d hach shanghai china was used to measure the water temperature and dissolved oxygen do in situ total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and the permanganate index codmn were determined in the laboratory a quantitative water quality analysis was performed using a 1 l sterile plastic bottle 50 cm below the surface for qualitative analysis of phytoplankton surface water samples were collected using a 25 plankton net and the collected phytoplankton were placed into 100 ml sample bottles which were immediately fixed with 3 ml formalin and taken to the laboratory for analysis for quantitative analysis of phytoplankton a plexiglass water collector collected a 1 l water sample 0 5 m below the surface and placed it into the sample bottle next the sample was fixed with 15 ml of luger s reagent and shaken well after standing for 48 h the supernatant was aspirated and concentrated to 30 ml and a plankton counting box was used to count it phytoplankton samples were examined using zeiss axio lab a1 zeiss axio imager m2 and olympus cx23 inverted microscope 200 magnification and identified to the species level the shannon wienner index h of each sample was calculated using primer e software quest research limited auckland new zealand the following formula was used h p i ln p i where pi ni n pi is the ratio of the number of individuals of the ith species to the total number of individuals ni is the total number of individuals of the ith species and n is the total number of species 2 3 integrated modeling framework of efdc and rf considering spatiotemporal coverage to predict and analyze the response of phytoplankton diversity to water replenishment an integrated framework was developed based on the pb efdc and dd rf models the efdc simulation yielded values of the environmental variables under different water replenishment schemes and the rf model established the response relationship between environmental variables and phytoplankton diversity the shannon wienner index h under different water replenishment schemes was derived by integrating efdc and rf model in addition the uncertainty was considered when the efdc output was transmitted to the rf model as the input condition the framework of this integrated model was shown in fig 2 2 3 1 efdc modeling the efdc is a comprehensive three dimensional numerical model that has been widely used in a wide range of environmental studies including simulations of hydrodynamics thermal stratification water age transport lagrangian particle tracers and eutrophication processes in rivers lakes estuaries reservoirs wetlands and coastal regions gong et al 2009 li et al 2013 zeng et al 2015 the main governing equations are presented in the supplementary information a high resolution cartesian grid was developed for bl fig s1 a the computational domain had a spatial resolution of 100 100 m in the vertical direction the sigma coordinate was applied and each cell was divided into four even layers fig s1 b shows the boundary and corresponding underwater terrain of bl the model simulation was implemented with a 10 s constant time step which was proven to be appropriate for guaranteeing model precision and stability in this study hydrometeorological data measured from april 1 2015 to may 31 2015 were chosen for model calibration april 1 2015 april 30 2015 and verification may 1 2015 may 31 2015 the water quality data measured from may 1 2020 to june 30 2020 were chosen for model calibration may 1 2020 may 31 2020 and verification june 1 2020 june 30 2020 the results of calibration validation are presented in fig s3 and fig s4 the water quality indicators used to establish the efdc model were do codmn tn and tp the root mean square error rmse and nash efficiency coefficient nse were used to evaluate simulation accuracy the calculation formulas for the two indicators are as follows rmse i 1 n o i p i 2 n nse 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where o i and p i represent the sample of size n containing observations and model estimates respectively o is the mean of the observed values 2 3 2 random forest rf modeling as an ensemble learning method the rf is a combination of tree predictors each tree in the rf was constructed using a different bootstrap sample of the data and each node was split using the best among a subset of predictors randomly chosen at that node which could strongly reduce the correlation among trees to improve model performance wang and chen 2020 the final results were determined by majority votes for classification or averages for regression of all the trees in the rf this method is unaffected by excessive parameterization in nature and has been widely used as a meaningful method for predicting phytoplankton species richness in temperate lakes catherine et al 2016 mallinis et al 2020 wu and liang 2018 there are two ways to evaluate the ranking of the most important predictive variables in rf models increment in the mean of squared residuals msr and node purity béjaoui et al 2018 the first is computed by permuting the out of bag oob data and for each tree the prediction error on the oob portion of the data is recorded the same is done after permuting each predictor variable the differences between the two were then averaged over all trees and normalized to the standard deviation of the differences strobl et al 2008 the second is the total decrease in node impurities i e the variance from splitting on the variable averaged over all trees béjaoui et al 2018 both techniques are widely used in ecology and statistics and there are no fixed criteria to select the best ranking method béjaoui et al 2016 we used node purity to evaluate the importance ranking of predictive variables in the rf model the response and predictive variables were the measured water environmental factors and the phytoplankton shannon wienner index respectively the predictive accuracy of the rf model was evaluated through 5 fold cross validation supplementary information the r2 and nse values were used to evaluate the predictive power of the model model runs were performed with r software version 4 0 1 using the random forest package liaw and wiener 2018 2 3 3 spatiotemporal uncertainty processing for integrated models to solve the uncertainty caused during data transmission between coupled models considering that most pb models can obtain the continuous spatiotemporal variation of water body indicators we can select water body indicators in a certain spatiotemporal range and input them into the rf model to drive the prediction of the dd model the size of this spatiotemporal range is called spatiotemporal coverage appropriate spatiotemporal coverage can also ensure that the prediction results of the coupled model are representative to ensure the appropriate spatiotemporal coverage we analyzed the influence of different time coverages on the output of the coupled model and proposed a method based on a probability distribution to determine the appropriate spatiotemporal coverage of the coupling model the adjusted multiple decision coefficient r a 2 and absolute error ae were selected as the two indicators to measure the suitability of the temporal and spatial coverage for spatial coverage we selected 16 adjacent grids with a resolution of 100 m 100 m fig 3 a on the premise of the same spatial coverage we selected four groups of different time coverage schemes 5 10 15 and 30 days fig 3 b we calculated all diversity indexes h under four groups of different spatiotemporal coverage by the coupling model and constructed frequency distribution diagrams of h and the corresponding frequency n under different spatiotemporal coverage fig 3 c finally we made extensive use of r a 2 and ae between h i a v e and measured h to determine the appropriate spatiotemporal coverage fig 3 d h i a v e and ae were calculated as follows h i ave j n ij n i h ij ae h i ave h i r a 2 1 1 r 2 n 1 n k 1 where hij is the h of frequency j in the ith scheme nij is the frequency corresponding to whose h is hij ni is the total sample size obtained by the ith scheme h i is h obtained from measured data ae is the ae between h i and h i a v e r a 2 is the adjusted multiple coefficient of determination r is the multiple coefficient of determination n is the number of samples and k is the number of independent variables 2 4 scenario setting the effect of water replenishment on biodiversity in baiyangdian lake the efdc was used to simulate the chemical and physical parameter distributions under different replenishment scenarios in bl and the model was run for 275 days from march to november based on data availability because the surface water of bl freezes in winter from december to february the rf model was used to predict the distribution of phytoplankton shannon wienner index h based on the efdc simulation results by predicting the phytoplankton biodiversity distribution under different water replenishment schemes we aimed to analyze the time space differences in the ecological restoration effect of water replenishment and its leading reasons and to guide the formulation and optimization of aquatic ecological restoration according to the actual situation of ecological water replenishment in bl in recent years four ecological water replenishment schemes with different water flows have been established the monthly flow changes in bl under different water replenishment schemes are shown in fig 4 the quantity of reclaimed water remained unchanged under all four water replenishment schemes in contrast under the four ecological water replenishment schemes the water replenishment of the yellow river and south to north water diversion projects increased successively from non replenishment to high flow replenishment with a gradient of 350 million m3 year the water quality boundary conditions for each scheme are presented in fig s2 3 results 3 1 physical and chemical indices of water body and shannon wienner index according to the chemical and physical parameters and shannon wienner index h of bl from 2017 to 2020 there were significant spatiotemporal differences at different sampling points and in different periods from the perspective of temporal variation do tn and tp were significantly different however codmn and h showed little change fig 5 tp began to decrease after reaching a peak of 0 16 mg l in 2018 whereas tn began to decrease after reaching a peak of 2 74 mg l in 2019 indicating that a series of government measures implemented in bl in recent years such as the ecological water diversion silt removal and dismantle the cofferdam projects have played a positive role however unlike do tp tn and other indicators the biodiversity indices h and codmn showed no significant changes with water quality indicators during the sampling period on the one hand it indicates that the water diversion project is slow to restore water ecology and it is necessary to continuously monitor the future chemical and physical parameters and water ecology to assess the impact of the water diversion project on the other hand it also indicates that the current treatment measures did not effectively reduce the concentration of organic pollutants in bl in the future the source of organic pollutants in bl should be analyzed to implement more effective measures to reduce the concentration of organic pollutants in addition the sampling results showed that the h of bl showed an apparent decreasing trend in october 2020 which may be caused by the combined effect of low nutrient concentration and low temperature from the perspective of spatial variation the nutrient concentration in the northern part of bl was higher than that in the southern part and the phytoplankton biodiversity in the central area of bl s2 s3 s4 was lower than that in other locations fig 6 the dominant species in the central area of bl and other area are mainly cyanobacteria and chlorophyta table s5 mainly including anabaena oscillarioides merismopedia tenuissima microcystis aeruginosa crucigenia tetrapedia and scenedesmus dimorphus etc and the average phytoplankton cell density in baiyangdian lake is 34 20 106 ind l of which the phytoplankton cell density in the center area is 32 46 106 ind l and the phytoplankton cell density in the rest area is 36 32 106 ind l therefore the phytoplankton cell density in the center area of bl was also lower than that in the rest fig s5 the fu river northwest of bl receives wastewater from baoding city and carries pollutants generated upstream into bl however the southern part of bl is further from the source of the fu river than the northern part which is less affected by the fu river therefore the nutrient concentration in the northern part of bl is generally higher than that in the southern part codmn did not show the more in the south and less in the north distribution pattern similar to nutrient concentration however it was roughly evenly distributed in bl indicating that the organic pollutants represented by codmn concentration were not transported by the fu river but may be produced by the baiyangdian aquatic ecological environment phytoplankton communities are generally affected by temperature do and nutrients tang et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 therefore the low concentration of nutrients and do in the central area of bl is a key factor that lowers its biodiversity 3 2 establishment and validation of rf model the validation results of the rf model are presented in table s1 and fig 7 pearson correlation coefficient r2 and nse were used to evaluate the rf model performance the results showed that the r2 of the predicted and measured data was 0 912 and the nse was 0 758 indicating that the model performed well ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 therefore the rf model based on chemical and physical parameters can be used as a reliable phytoplankton community prediction tool for bl fig 8 shows that do was the most significant environmental factor affecting phytoplankton biodiversity among all chemical and physical parameters studies have found that do is closely related to the growth and death of phytoplankton communities li et al 2018 and that low do concentrations may lead to a decrease in phytoplankton species and biodiversity zhang et al 2018 in previous studies on bl do was also an important environmental factor affecting phytoplankton biodiversity tang et al 2019 water temperature and tp were also critical environmental factors affecting phytoplankton biodiversity fig 8 previous studies have shown that phytoplankton species richness increases linearly as the temperature gradually increases to 19 c catherine et al 2016 therefore water temperature plays a critical role in the growth and reproduction of phytoplankton liu et al 2016 which is an important factor driving seasonal variation in phytoplankton biodiversity and a key environmental factor affecting phytoplankton community composition shi et al 2020 concurrently the increase in tp concentration also decreases phytoplankton species richness increases phytoplankton dominance yang et al 2021 and changes the nutrient structure of water jeppesen et al 2000 existing studies on bl have also found that water temperature and tp are critical environmental factors affecting phytoplankton biodiversity tang et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 3 3 establishment and validation of a hydrodynamic water quality model 3 3 1 verification of the hydrodynamic part the parameter values and data sources for the efdc model are listed in table s2 according to the daily water level verification results of s6 station fig s3 the ae between simulated and measured water level values is in the range of 0 02 0 03 m rmse is 0 008 m and nse is 0 88 the results show that the model accurately reflects the water level fluctuation and is suitable for hydrodynamic process simulation of bl 3 3 2 verification of the water quality part the initial conditions and main chemical and physical parameters are listed in table s3 based on the validation results obtained at sampling point s4 fig s4 the nse of each chemical and physical parameter in 2020 is 0 70 and the simulation results can better reflect the change process of water quality in the simulated area this shows that the water quality model of bl can be used to simulate water quality under different water replenishment scenarios 3 4 establishment and validation of the efdc and rf coupling model the predicted biodiversity at s3 sampling site in july is shown in fig 9 it can be seen that the h distribution of phytoplankton in the bl is relatively dispersed under different time coverages ranging from 1 7 to 2 3 fig 9 a d therefore when the output result of the pb model is transmitted to the dd model as the input condition the water quality simulation results at a particular site and point in time cannot be taken because it cannot represent the water ecological status of the research area during that period under the premise of considering certain spatial coverage we obtained h indices of different time coverages of 1 913 1 899 1 884 and 1 850 and the ae between simulated values and measured values was 0 038 0 101 table 1 the results show that the coupling model is suitable for the simulation of hydrodynamic water quality and phytoplankton biodiversity in bl and the prediction accuracy of the coupling model is preferable to that of the previous dd model tamvakis et al 2014 when the time coverage was 30 days the overall characteristics of h in the simulated area were not obvious r2 0 55 which indicates that it was difficult to obtain the overall characteristics of h in the simulated area after 30 days of time coverage when the time coverage decreased to 15 days the overall characteristics of h in the simulated area were obvious r2 0 67 when the time coverage continues to decrease the overall characteristics of h in the simulated area tend to be stable which means that when the time coverage decreases to 10 days or less the overall characteristics of the simulated h index are relatively stable however decreasing the time coverage did not effectively improve the regularity of the simulated data r2 0 70 simultaneously it can be seen that a longer time coverage 30 days also leads to a sizeable ae of the prediction results table 1 therefore to ensure the stability of the overall characteristics and accuracy of the prediction results the time coverage should be 10 15 days in the subsequent scenario analysis in section 3 5 the selected time coverage was 15 days 3 5 scenario analysis based on water replenishment in baiyangdian lake the phytoplankton biodiversity results in the simulated area of bl from march to november under the four ecological water replenishment schemes are shown in fig 10 in each sub graph the vertical and horizontal axes represent the phytoplankton biodiversity index h and location label of the simulated area respectively therefore each row represents the annual variation in phytoplankton diversity in the simulated area of bl affected by the same river under the different water replenishment schemes each column represents the phytoplankton diversity in the simulated baiyangdian area affected by different rivers during the same month under different water refill schemes overall our predictions suggest that water replenishment has a positive effect on the biodiversity of bl however the effect is determined by the water quality of both water replenishment and water receiving areas when the area where the water quality of water replenishment is better than that of the water receiving area fu river the effect of low flow water replenishment is mainly manifested as dilution under which the significant improvement of water quality is conducive to improved biodiversity fig 10 c and d however in areas with little difference between the water quality of water replenishment and water receiving areas xiaobai river and baigou river water receiving areas low flow water replenishment inhibits the improvement in phytoplankton biodiversity this is because the dilution effect was not obvious and the effect of water replenishment is represented more by the disturbance of the water column in the water receiving area which results in nutrient release from sediment zeng et al 2015 the above phenomenon only occurred in the low flow water replenishment scheme while the biodiversity of the three rivers increased with the increase in water replenishment flow in the medium and high flow water replenishment schemes fig 10 b h and j in addition the results showed that there were significant spatiotemporal differences in the restoration effect of water replenishment on biodiversity from the perspective of spatial variation there was an effective area for the restoration effect of water replenishment on biodiversity the results showed that under different water replenishment schemes water replenishment through the fu river and baigou river had a limited impact on the biodiversity of bl even increasing the flow in contrast the increase in water replenishment flow of the xiaobai river is positively correlated with the increase in biodiversity the influence range expands significantly which is manifested as point b c and d at the edges of the influence ranges of low medium and high flow respectively fig 10 h in addition the biodiversity of the center of bl was unaffected by water replenishment in the four water replenishment schemes simulation areas 6 and 7 and simulation area d fig 10 d h and j from the perspective of temporal variation phytoplankton biodiversity showed a seasonal variation pattern of high in winter and spring and low in summer and autumn in bl under different water replenishment schemes and routing fig 10 and the phytoplankton biodiversity index h was at the lowest value in summer 4 discussion 4 1 effect of water replenishment on biodiversity in baiyangdian lake the effects of water replenishment on the phytoplankton diversity in lacustrine ecosystems has been reported in many previous studies fornarelli et al 2013 li et al 2013 dai et al 2020 most of these studies have observed an increase in the diversity in water receiving aquatic ecosystems li et al 2013 dai et al 2020 our study also found water replenishment had a positive effect on the biodiversity of bl in addition the results indicated no positive correlation between the quantity of replenished water and biodiversity it was found that when the volume of diluted water was almost equal to the volume of the lake the water quality improved due to the flushing of diluted water welch and patmont 1980 the water quantity of the medium and high flow water replenishment schemes is approximately 400 600 million m3 which is almost equal to the lake s storage however in these two water replenishment schemes biodiversity did not increase with increasing water quantity therefore the effect of increasing water quantity on improving biodiversity is limited 4 2 spatial difference of multi source water replenishment in baiyangdian lake the result showed that there is an effective area for the restoration effect of water replenishment on biodiversity and similar findings dai et al 2020 zeng et al 2015 were found in previous studies in addition to the water quality and quantity we also found that the effective area was related to water replenishment routing and internal hydrological connectivity of bl the results showed that under different water replenishment schemes the edges of the impact range through the fu river on the biodiversity of bl were limited in simulated area 3 fig 10 a and b which was caused by the poor hydrological connectivity between the northwest part of bl and its central area with only a narrow river connection sun et al 2022 in contrast the xiaobai river has comprehensive water replenishment routing and is directly connected to the central area of bl with good hydrological connectivity therefore increasing the flow can significantly increase its water ecological impact the baigou river is similar to the fu river which shows that when the replenishment flow increases to a certain extent the range of water ecological influence cannot be significantly increased this is because villages between simulated areas c and d in bl weakened the hydrological connectivity between the baigou river water replenishment channel and the central area of bl resulting in a poor water replenishment effect fig 10 i and l in conclusion compared with the baigou and fu rivers the xiaobai river has the most significant potential for the ecological restoration of bl however attention must also be given to the ecological restoration of the fu and baigou river in local areas considering the existence of an effective area in different water replenishment channels multiple water replenishment routes can be adapted to maximize the overall ecological restoration benefits on the premise that the total water quantity is determined 4 3 seasonal difference of multi source water replenishment in baiyangdian lake the seasonal variation in phytoplankton biodiversity in bl is primarily driven by temperature and nutrients studies have shown that high temperatures in summer inhibit phytoplankton biodiversity to a certain extent catherine et al 2016 this is responsible for the high in winter and spring and low in summer and autumn seasonal variation pattern in phytoplankton biodiversity in bl fig 10 this trend is evident in the entire bl area unlike temperature the effect of nutrients on phytoplankton biodiversity is limited within the effective area the lowest biodiversity in summer was not only found in bl but also found in other lakes zhu et al 2020 a summer peak is generally accompanied by this phenomenon in phytoplankton density or chl a concentration zhu et al 2020 this is because the overgrowth of blue green algae combined with temperature and nutrients occupies the ecological niche of other algae resulting in low biodiversity and high density of phytoplankton in summer therefore it is important to improve phytoplankton biodiversity in estival bl and inhibit the excessive growth of blue green algae because of flood risk ecological water replenishment is generally not conducted in july and august therefore it is not feasible to improve phytoplankton biodiversity in summer through water replenishment the results showed that water replenishment in spring can improve phytoplankton biodiversity in early summer fig 10 c and k moreover compared with oligotrophic areas such as the xiaobai and baigou rivers the phenomenon was more evident in the fu river and other eutrophic areas hence implementing ecological water replenishment in spring can effectively reduce the risk of phytoplankton diversity reduction and algal blooms in the summer 4 4 advantages and applications of the integrated framework in water replenishment management first of all our framework based on a well validation model is able to predict by combining the advantages of the pb model and dd model the ecological restoration effect of water replenishment considering the uncertainty in the data transmission using a method based on probability distribution to select appropriate spatiotemporal coverage improves the prediction accuracy a series of simulation scenarios were designed through the framework to determine the temporal and spatial differences of the ecological restoration effect of water replenishment and its leading reasons to guide the ecological management of bl secondly the previous prediction models for phytoplankton mostly used chlorophyll or algal density as the predictor liu et al 2015 zeng et al 2017 harris and graham 2017 while our framework uses the shannon wienner index h to focus on the change of community structure through our framework the impact of environmental factor changes on phytoplankton biodiversity can be directly obtained finally efdc has been widely used in various aquatic ecosystems wang and boegman 2021 zhang et al 2021 also rf models have been widely used to predict phytoplankton biomass liu et al 2015 zeng et al 2017 harris and graham 2017 therefore the developed framework for predicting diversity is not limited to baiyangdian lake which can be easily transferred to other aquatic ecosystems to provide guidance for formulating and optimizing water replenishment schemes for ecological restoration purposes 5 conclusion this study established a prediction model for determining the impact of a water diversion project on phytoplankton biodiversity the following conclusions were drawn 1 it is necessary to consider spatiotemporal coverage to reduce uncertainty during model coupling the prediction result will be unrepresentative if spatiotemporal coverage is not adequately accounted for when the time coverage is 10 15 days the overall characteristics of h can be effectively obtained and the prediction accuracy can be guaranteed 2 the integrated model can predict the ecological restoration effect of water replenishment and guide the ecological management of bl water replenishment has a positive effect on bl biodiversity in addition the effect is determined by the water quality of both the water replenishment and water receiving areas there are effective areas for the restoration of biodiversity of water replenishment which is related to water quality and quantity water replenishment paths and internal hydrological connectivity compared with the baigou and fu rivers the xiaobai river has the most significant potential for aquatic ecological restoration appropriate water replenishment in spring is crucial for alleviating the decrease in phytoplankton biodiversity caused by flood control in summer credit authorship contribution statement bowen sun writing original draft guoyu wang conceptualization

3047,flood susceptibility assessment for identifying flood prone areas plays a significant role in flood hazard mitigation machine learning is an optional assessment method because of its high objectivity and computational efficiency but how to get enough and accurate information of historical flood locations to train the machine learning models has been a key problem in recent years news media data from both news websites and social media accounts has emerged as a promising source for natural science studies however the application of news media data in urban flood susceptibility assessment is still inadequate this study proposed an approach to fill this gap firstly flood locations were extracted from news media data based on a named entity recognition ner model then a frequency or distance based data quality control method was employed to improve the representativeness of the extracted flooded locations finally flood conditioning factors with information of historical flood locations were input into a support vector machine svm model for flood susceptibility assessment we took the central city of dalian china as a case study the t test results show that there was no significant difference between the distributions of most flood conditioning factors at the flood locations from the news media data and the official planning report in the obtained flood susceptibility map the high flood susceptibility areas got a recall of 90 compared with the high flood hazard areas in the planning report performing data quality control in the frequency based method can improve the precision of the flood susceptibility map by up to 5 while the distance based method is ineffective this study provides an example and offers the value of applying new data sources and modern deep learning techniques for urban flood management keywords urban flood susceptibility news media data flood locations named entity recognition data quality control data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction floods cause significant environmental damage human casualties and economic loss worldwide arora et al 2021 according to swiss re institute sri in 2021 the global economic losses caused by floods reached 82 billion accounting for 31 of the global economic losses related to natural disasters as a natural phenomenon floods cannot be prevented completely but the damages can be mitigated by appropriate planning and management gao et al 2020 flood susceptibility assessment plays an important role in flood mitigation costache et al 2020 flood susceptibility defines the possibility of flooding in a certain area based on the geo environmental conditions fang et al 2021 different from the concept of flood hazard flood susceptibility reflects the intrinsic property of an area rather than the effect of a specific event a credible flood susceptibility map is a useful tool to identify flood prone areas and can provide effective guidance for decision makers to manage flood hazards bui et al 2020 flood susceptibility mapping is typically achieved using multi criteria decision making mcdm methods or machine learning methods mcdm methods such as the analytical hierarchy process ahp tella and balogun 2020 kazakis et al 2015 and vise kriterijumska optimizacijaik ompromisno resenje vikor khosravi et al 2019 mahato et al 2022 have been widely used by firstly determining the variables related to flooding and calculating the weight of each variable and then calculating the flood susceptibility based on the weighted variables however mcdm methods require the knowledge of the decision makers to make judgments about variables thus they are subjective and may lead to inappropriate decision making due to cognitive bias mudashiru et al 2021 by contrast machine learning methods can improve the objectivity of the flood susceptibility map through automatically establishing the relationships between the flood conditioning factors and the corresponding labels historical flood or non flooded locations the machine learning models can predict the flood susceptibility of unlabeled locations based on their conditioning factors commonly used algorithms include artificial neural networks anns zhao et al 2019 random forest rf islam et al 2021 support vector machine svm tehrany et al 2014 convolutional neural network cnn zhao et al 2020 logistic regression lr bui et al 2019 and long short term memory lstm fang et al 2021 among these methods svm has been applied by a series of previous studies tang et al 2021 tehrany et al 2015 in a natural basin tehrany et al 2015 compared the performances of svm and frequency ratio fr models and the results showed that the area under the curve auc of the receiver operating characteristic curve roc curve of the svm 84 97 was higher than that of the fr 61 43 which proved the classification ability of the svm as for the urban scenarios tang et al 2021 assessed flood susceptibility in guangzhou city and the svm also output relatively accurate results auc 0 84 the performance of machine learning methods relies heavily on the quantity and quality of the training data so getting enough and accurate information of historical flood locations has been a critical problem when machine learning methods are used the commonly used data sources include governmental reports hazarika et al 2016 tehrany et al 2019 newspapers archive baranowski et al 2020 rahmati et al 2020 field surveys talukdar et al 2020 tehrany et al 2015 and remote sensing observations costache et al 2020 wang et al 2019 among these sources governmental reports and field surveys are more accurate as they are generally derived from first hand data but they are time consuming to collect and cannot be updated in real time the remote sensing data has high spatial coverage but their accuracy is limited by the inversion methods of transferring the image information to the flood information and environmental conditions such as the cloud cover as for newspapers archive the authenticity and timeliness of news ensure the reliability of flood locations young 1990 but it takes effort and time to extract and digitize the effective information with the development of digital media platforms news media data have become a convenient data source for collecting flooded locations more and more traditional news media such as newspapers have set up online channels including news websites and social media accounts tarkiainen et al 2014 therefore news media data is a potentially promising resource for natural science avellaneda et al 2020 for example liu et al 2018 used news media data to extract and analyze information on the characteristics of natural disasters in china and found high co occurrence of meteorological and geological hazards guo et al 2022 built a methodological framework for news media datasets to track conflict and cooperation dynamics on transboundary rivers as one of the natural disasters that seriously affects the life of urban residents floods are also very concerned by the news media however there is still a lack of studies on using news media data for urban flood susceptibility assessment the application of massive news media data calls for a practical approach to extract flood locations automatically traditionally some researchers extract locations manually zeng et al 2020 which pays many human costs to ensure accuracy but lacks scientific and universal applicability another simple method is the rule based method which establishes matching rules to match the words in the text with a comprehensive set of location names de bruijn et al 2018 however there may be confusions when one name corresponds to multiple locations or other named entities like a person named entity recognition ner can automatically and accurately extract location names from news media data by analyzing the structure and grammar of text language the ner is an information extraction method for finding and sorting named entities into pre defined tags persons locations and organizations li et al 2018 researchers have applied several traditional machine learning methods such as hidden markov model hmm gayen and sarkar 2014 and conditional random field crf konkol and konopík 2013 for ner tasks the feature extraction process of these methods is cumbersome and cannot acquire ideal recognition results with a limited labeled training set in recent years deep learning has been applied to ner which can avoid tedious manual feature extraction as a typical example lample et al 2016 proposed a neural network model combining bidirectional long short term memory bilstm with crf for the ner task which showed its ability with a relatively high f1 score of 0 91 this study aims to use news media data to extract flood locations for urban flood susceptibility assessment two questions have been addressed 1 how accurate are the flood locations extracted from news media data and the corresponding calculated flood susceptibility map and 2 how to control the quality of flood locations and what effect does it have on the susceptibility results firstly we adopted a ner bilstm crf model to extract flood locations from news media data moreover two types of data quality control methods based on the frequency of the locations mentioned and the distance between every two locations respectively were applied to filter out several flood locations automatically finally urban flood susceptibility was calculated by an svm model the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the study area and data collected section 3 describes the methodology including extracting flood location controlling data quality and mapping flood susceptibility section 4 shows the results including the distribution of flood locations extracted from the news media data and the flood susceptibility maps after using different data quality control methods section 5 mainly discusses the findings and limitations of the study finally the conclusion is given in the last section 2 study area and data 2 1 study area in this study we selected the central city of dalian as the case site fig 1 the central city consists of four districts ganjingzi shahekou xigang and zhongshan with a total area of 550 27 km2 a warm temperate continental monsoon climate characterizes this area the average annual rainfall is 687 mm and 74 of the precipitation occurs in july and august this area is located along the coast and vulnerable to northward typhoons or severe convective weather which makes it susceptible to pluvial flooding 2 2 data collected the main goal of this study is to use news media data and a data driven model to map flood susceptibility therefore it is necessary to collect the news texts which contain the flood location information and multiple data sources which contain flood conditioning factors furthermore a related official report is collected to serve as the validation data 2 2 1 news media data the news media data used in this study were collected from both the social media platform sina weibo and the news website dalian newspaper online as for the social media platform we first searched for the texts under the dalian rainstorm topic to see where the texts came from then we found that the weibo account bandaochenbao contributed the most to this topic so we selected this account as the appropriate microblog data source and collected all its texts for extracting flood locations the account was created by an authoritative local newspaper sponsored by liaoning daily newspaper group called the peninsula morning news it provides timely coverage of social news and focuses on hot issues in people s livelihoods additionally dalian newspaper online the official digital website of the dalian news media group was used to supplement more news data it collects the news from many local newspapers such as dalian daily dalian evening news and northeast window the news media data we concerned were collected by different web crawlers which can automatically capture the contents on the website sina weibo application programming interface api was used for the social media platform and uniform resource locators urls of each news link were selected for the news website in summary the detailed information of the news media data collected in this study is shown in table 1 the original texts collected from sina weibo and dalian newspaper online contain extraneous characters such as spaces hyperlinks etc so text filtering is necessary as a pre processing procedure to remove these redundant texts and characters the filtering process was performed through the regular expression re module in python 2 2 2 flood conditioning factors six flood conditioning factors that quantify the topographical precipitation drainage and land use characteristics were collected to develop the model for flood susceptibility mapping fig 2 all the factors were standardized to 0 1 and converted to a matrix format as the input of the svm model the detailed information on the data source is given in table 2 and the definitions and reasons for choosing the six factors are described as follows 1 topographic factors topography is one of the major factors in evaluating flood prone areas wang et al 2015 different topography would lead to distinct hydrological processes in various areas chen et al 2020 shreekumar et al 2021 topographic factors are all extracted and calculated from the digital elevation model dem here including elevation slope and topographic wetness index twi sahana et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 the elevation is the basic factor directly extracted from the dem the slope is the maximum rate of change of the elevation value from one site to its neighbors in addition the twi indicates the tendency of flow under the influence of gravity and it was calculated using hydrology and raster surface tools in arcgis 10 2 as follows 1 t w i l n α tan β where α is the upslope area per unit contour length and tan β is the local gradient in the radians 2 precipitation factor precipitation has been identified as one of the significant causes of urban flooding islam et al 2021 here the average annual maximum daily precipitation between 2012 and 2019 same as the period of media data was used to characterize the precipitation in the study area 3 land use factor the distribution of land use especially impervious types also affects the formation of urban flooding wang et al 2021a b built up areas with a high impervious rate commonly yield more storm runoff zhao et al 2020 here the normalized difference built up index ndbi was selected as a land use factor to characterize imperviousness and it was calculated by eq 2 he et al 2010 from landsat 8 images in google earth engine 2 ndbi mir n i r mir n i r where mir is a middle infrared band and nir is a near infrared band in the landsat images 4 drainage factor the urban drainage system plays an essential role in flood discharge and areas with low urban drainage density are more prone to flooding rafiei sardooi et al 2021 in this study the drainage density was calculated by eq 3 lee et al 2018 to reflect the drainage system capacity 3 drainagedensity 1 s i 1 n l i where s is the area of each grid n is the number of pipes in the grid and l i is the length of each pipe within the grid 2 2 3 validation data to assess the reasonability of media data application an official planning report of stormwater management from the dalian planning department dpd was used for comparison this report was completed in 2014 and contained the historical flood locations obtained from field surveys and a validated flood hazard map produced by a mike urban model there were 47 historical flood locations frequently inundated in this report the mike urban model was developed with the underlying surface and pipe network data and simulated the maximum flooding depth of each drainage zone by inputting the 24 hour design rainfall of a 50 year return period as a result the maximum flooding depth of 16 of the study area exceeded 0 1 m and these areas were considered as the high level hazard area while the other 84 areas were regarded as the low level hazard area fig 3 3 methods an approach consisting of three tasks was proposed in this study extracting flood locations controlling data quality and mapping flood susceptibility fig 4 firstly flood locations were recognized by a ner bilstm crf model secondly a frequency based or distance based data quality control method was used to improve the representativeness of the extracted flooded locations at last the flood susceptibility map was generated with the help of an svm model 3 1 extracting flood locations extracting flood locations is the core task of the whole approach and it can be completed in three steps firstly characters from the microsoft research asia msra corpus which contains many labeled chinese sentences were collected and tagged as named entities representing persons locations and organizations they were transformed from the text form to a vector form before serving as training data secondly the ner model for flood location extraction was trained based on the msra corpus finally news texts collected were input into the trained ner model to extract the locations mentioned in the texts the recognized locations were checked manually through the baidu map coordinate picking system which returned geographic coordinates by searching for location names 3 1 1 data preparation for training the ner model the msra corpus is an available dataset for the chinese ner han et al 2021 it contains three types of named entities per person loc location and org organization per stands for pronouns that can be used to distinguish human being individuals loc denotes the exact position of something and org is where a group of people has been organized with specific aims and objectives such as a factory hospital and government department in this study the msra corpus was used as both the training and test sets and the number of each named entity in the dataset is shown in table 3 commonly used tagging methods for named entity recognition include the bio and bioes methods b represents the beginning of the named entity word i represents the inside part o represents the non entity word e means the end of the entity and s represents a single character entity although the difference in performance between the two methods is small wei et al 2021 the bioes annotation produces more labels which may undermine the efficiency of the ner model therefore the bio method was chosen for this study so that each character would match a label belonging to the set b per i per b loc i loc b org i org o since the ner model cannot directly manipulate symbolic languages such as text it is necessary to convert the text data into a numerical vector pham and le 2018 in this study texts were transformed into vector representations using one hot encoding which is widely used in ner tasks dai et al 2020 ji et al 2018 a one hot vector is a 1 n matrix vector in which all values are 0 except for a single 1 used to distinguish each character from every other character in the corpus arnaud et al 2021 3 1 2 the ner model bilstm crf the ner model in this study is a bilstm crf network consisting of three layers lample et al 2016 the first layer is a look up layer for transforming each character representation from a one hot vector into a lower dimensional vector representation secondly a bilstm layer is adopted to extract features from the input character vectors the third layer is a crf layer which labels the tag for each character based on the features extracted by the bilstm layer overall the input of the ner model is a sequence of characters x x1 x2 xn and the output is a predicted tag sequence y y1 y2 yn fig 5 illustrates how the bilstm crf works 1 look up layer in the look up layer character embedding was used to describe the characters by turning discrete one hot vectors into continuous variables embeddings reduce the spatial dimensionality of discrete variables and can better represent the relationships between different variables especially in the chinese ner task the character embedding method can avoid the performance degradation caused by the inaccuracy of the word segmentation chenhao and chengyao 2019 2 bilstm layer bilstm belongs to the group of lstms which is a variant of recurrent neural networks rnns unlike other rnn models that tend to be biased towards their most recent inputs in the sequence bengio et al 1994 the lstm can capture long temporal dependencies by incorporating a memory cell into the model structure lample et al 2016 as shown in fig 6 in the lstm network the memory cell captures critical information and stores it for a certain period tang et al 2020 each memory cell is connected recurrently with an input forget and output gate the computational principle of lstm is defined as follows 4 i t σ w x i x t w h i h t 1 w c i c t 1 w 0 i 5 f t σ w x f x t w h f h t 1 w c f c t 1 w 0 f 6 c t f t c t 1 i t tanh w x c x t w h c h t 1 w 0 c 7 o t σ w x o x t w h o h t 1 w c o c t 1 w 0 o 8 h t o t tanh c t where x t is the input σ is the sigmoid function it ft and ot are the outputs of the input forget and output gates respectively h represents the hidden state ct is the output of the cell gate constrained to the size of the hidden vector h t w and w0 are the bias vectors and weights respectively specific to the ner task two extra hidden layers should be included to process data in a bidirectional way xu et al 2019 this adaptation is known as a bilstm network graves and schmidhuber 2005 in the plain lstm network information would only flow in the forward direction and the hidden state h t depends only on the previous one h t 1 meaningful subsequent information would be wasted which might lead to the error in the information extraction for example dalian in the dalian city planning bureau may be mistakenly extracted as location but in fact it should be identified as organization from a global perspective with the bilstm network we can take forward direction and backward direction lstm for each character sequence and then combine the output so that the subsequent context can be accounted for 3 crf layer after the bilstm extracted the feature of input embedding crf was applied to get the optimal sequence of labels when we tag each character individually the sequence has its limitations for example logically the tag i per cannot follow the tag b loc bilstm is good at processing long distance context information but cannot handle the dependency between adjacent tags crf takes the order and correlations between labels into consideration to decode the labels thus can make up for the shortcoming of the bilstm through the crf layer the score of the output tag sequence y y1 y2 yn is defined as follows 9 s x y i 0 n a y i y i 1 i 1 n p i y i where a represents a square matrix of transition scores in the crf layer and a y i y i 1 represents the values of a transition from tag y i to tag y i 1 p is the output score matrix of the bilstm layer and p i y i represents the score of the character i belonging to the tag y i the output of the maximum score y obtained after decoding is 10 y a r g m a x log s o f t m a x s x y 3 1 3 model training the msra dataset labeled by the bio method was adopted to train and test the ner model the model parameters were optimized based on the training set and the trained model would be used to extract the location labels from news texts 3 1 4 model evaluation in this study the recall r precision p and f1 score f1 expressed as equations 11 13 were used to evaluate the performance of the ner model the values of these indexes range from 0 to 1 with higher values indicating better performance 11 p tp tp f p 12 r tp tp f n 13 f 1 2 p r p r where tp true positive represents the number of characters that are recognized as named entities and match the ground truth while fp false positive denotes the number of characters that are recognized as named entities but do not match the ground truth and fn false negative means the number of characters that are labeled as actual named entities but not recognized by the model 3 1 5 flood location extraction and verification once the ner model was trained the news media data were fed into the model to predict their labels through retrieval in the baidu map coordinate picking system the set of location labels is checked whether the corresponding geographical coordinates are within the study area if the corresponding coordinates are matched the location label is guaranteed to be correct in this way misclassified labels and locations of non study regions can be filtered out 3 2 data quality control in this study two data quality control methods based on the frequency or distance of flood locations are employed to improve the representativeness of the extracted flooded locations first as news texts include flood locations that have occurred only a few times due to specific conditions and may not reflect the characteristics of flood susceptibility we filtered the locations from news media by their frequency the frequency thresholds were set for the same location to appear 1 2 and 3 times in different news reports and locations with frequencies above the threshold are considered eligible and those below the threshold are filtered out on the other hand data quality control by the distance between each two flood locations was also investigated the aggregation of flood locations may be related to human activities which means that neighborhoods with higher crowd vitality indices or roads with higher traffic volumes receive more attention thus filtering by spatial distance is expected to undermine this effect considering that the spatial heterogeneity of the urban environment is greater than that of natural watersheds the threshold for sample spacing cannot be too large to capture features of flood prone areas according to the general neighborhood scale of the study area the distance thresholds were set to 500 m and 1 km flood locations separated by more than the threshold were considered eligible and otherwise removed 3 3 mapping flood susceptibility 3 3 1 flood susceptibility calculation the svm model was used to mine the mathematical relationship between the flooding conditions and susceptibility the entire study area was divided into 602 208 grids of 30 m 30 m consistent with the spatial resolution of the flood conditioning factors if a grid contains the coordinates of extracted flood locations it is considered a flooded location for training the same number of non flood locations as flood locations were selected artificially from local elevated and high drainage density areas zhao et al 2020 the flooded samples and non flooded samples were randomly partitioned into 70 and 30 groups as training sets and test sets upon completion of training the svm model the probability that non labeled grids belong to the flooded category or not would be predicted flood susceptibility was represented by the probability that each grid belongs to the classification of the flooded site then the study area was classified into different susceptibility zones representing five levels by the natural breaks method in arcgis jenks 1967 including very low low moderate high and very high the selection of a kernel type is essential for training the svm classification model damaševičius 2010 for this study the rbf kernel was selected based on its efficiency in previous related flood susceptibility research fang et al 2022 pradhan 2013 rahmati et al 2017 tehrany et al 2014 major parameters for optimization involved in the svm rbf training process included parameters c the regularization parameter and γ kernel width parameter c controls the trade off between training errors and margin and a low value of c may imply more training errors chen et al 2016 parameter γ adjusts the degree of non linearity of the svm model pradhan 2013 cross validation wang et al 2019 was adopted for this study to obtain the optimal parameter groups for each group the dataset was divided into six folds onefold was considered as the validation set and the remaining five folds were for training six validation accuracies could be obtained by rotating each fold as the validation set and the average of the six accuracies was taken as the cross validation accuracy cva for the group the group of parameters that achieved the highest cva was used in the final model the parameter optimization and model building were completed using the lib svm toolkit chang and lin 2001 in matlab r2014b 3 3 2 flood susceptibility evaluation the accuracy of the flood susceptibility map was evaluated by comparing it with the flood hazard map simulated by the mike urban model in the dpd official planning report to match up with the two levels of hazard the susceptibility results of the five levels were reclassified into two levels the high level includes the original very high and high susceptibility levels and the low level includes the others the precision and recall index were used to evaluate the performance of flood susceptibility mapping due to the imbalanced problem of the high level and low level areas in the flood hazard map the two indexes were only calculated for the high susceptibility areas which would greatly affect public safety and city function 4 results 4 1 flood locations extracted 4 1 1 the performance of the ner model the performance of the ner model trained and tested by the msra corpus was evaluated with the three evaluation indexes precision recall and f1 score as shown in table 4 the high f1 score for both the training set 0 88 and test set 0 85 indicates the effectiveness of the model in the ner of chinese texts wang et al 2021a b 4 1 2 flood locations extracted by the ner model in the news media data collected from both the weibo account named bandaochenbao and the dalian newspaper online website a total of 654 words were identified as the location tags by the ner model the tags in each news text were deduplicated to ensure that the same location in one piece of news was only counted once so that there were 183 of 654 location tags left after checking their corresponding geographical coordinates finally 136 flood locations were confirmed within the study area table 5 as shown in fig 7 only 14 of the 136 flood locations extracted from the news media data are overlapped with the 47 historical flood locations in the dpd planning report the reasons could be summarized as follows 1 the concerns of the two data sets are different the news media data mainly report the flood locations exposed to the public where the traffic or residents daily activities were influenced by the specific rainfall events in contrast the dpd planning report recorded repeated flood locations that caused serious economic or human losses therefore the number of flood locations extracted from news data significantly exceeds that of the dpd planning report 2 additionally the time ranges of the two data sets are different the news media data were collected during 2012 2019 while the dpd planning report was completed in 2014 to further ensure that the extracted flood locations are representative for subsequent flood susceptibility assessment we compared the flood conditioning factors at the flood locations from the news media data with the dpd planning report fig 8 a t test was carried out to evaluate the consistency of the distributions of the flood conditioning factors in which the p value greater than 0 05 means that the two distributions are not significantly different as a result p values of elevation slope twi precipitation ndbi and drainage density are 0 7 0 4 0 7 0 1 0 5 0 001 respectively it implied that all the flood conditioning factors show no significant difference except for the drainage density 4 1 3 flood locations filtered by data quality control as shown in fig 9 b d for the different frequency thresholds 1 2 and 3 the numbers of flood locations are 82 59 and 38 respectively the total flood locations with no quality control are mainly distributed in the northeast central and southeast as the frequency threshold increases the flood locations in the central part decrease the most with the distance threshold set as 500 m and 1 km the number of flood locations would be 83 and 48 respectively as shown in fig 9 e f as the distance threshold increases flood locations turn to be more uniformly distributed 4 2 flood susceptibility map the flood susceptibility map output by the svm model trained with the total flood locations is shown in fig 10 a the majority of the study area 33 is the very low susceptibility region which is more centralized in the west and southeast very high susceptibility class the probability of flooded category exceeding 0 81 and high susceptibility class the probability of flooded category between 0 62 and 0 81 covers nearly 20 and 18 of areas respectively and are mainly concentrated in the northern central and eastern areas the moderate the probability of flooded category between 0 40 and 0 62 and low susceptibility the probability of flooded category between 0 15 and 0 40 areas are more discrete the comparison results between the flood susceptibility map and the flood hazard map of the dpd planning report are shown in fig 11 b the reclassified high and low flood susceptibility classes account for 38 and 62 respectively fig 11 a while the high and low hazard areas account for 16 and 84 respectively fig 3 the high flood susceptibility areas obtain a recall of 90 compared with the high flood hazard areas but only with a precision of 36 4 3 impacts of quality control methods on flood susceptibility maps the flood susceptibility maps output by the svm model trained with the locations filtered by the five quality control scenarios are shown in fig 10 a f and each of them was compared with the flood hazard map table 6 in general the precision index has the opposite trend to the quantile of high susceptibility areas as for the frequency based method fig 10 b d the best performance is achieved with a frequency threshold of 1 or 2 f1 score 0 54 and the precision can be improved by up to 5 however when the frequency threshold is set to 3 the f1 score and precision both fall down when using distance based quality control methods fig 10 e f all the evaluation indexes are negatively correlated to the distance threshold 5 discussion this study verified news media data to be capable of supplementing historical flood inventory the objectivity and reality of the newspaper ensure the reliability of flood locations in news data furthermore despite there are differences between the flooding locations from the news and the dpd report the distributions of flood conditioning factors over the two sets are not significantly different from a statistical perspective which indicates that the two sets of locations have the same flood susceptibility characteristics the potential of using news media data to map urban flood susceptibility was also verified by this study the high flood susceptibility output by the svm model receives a high recall of 90 when compared with the high flood hazard map of the dpd report the area of high flood susceptibility is more than twice as large as that of the high hazard which caused the precision to be just 36 their differences can be understood by considering about their calculation methods the flood hazard is calculated based on the maximum flooding depth estimated by a mike urban model in which the flood comes from the overflow of the drainage network so we can find the flooding areas are mostly near the manholes fig 3 in comparison the svm can output the probability of flooding in any location based on their local flood conditioning factors specifically as shown in fig 10 b the high susceptibility areas distributed in the northern and eastern coastal areas which cover relatively low elevation low drainage density and high proportion of built up areas would not be identified as high hazard areas by the mike urban model to ensure the representativeness of the extracted flooded locations we proposed a series of quality control methods no matter based on the frequency or distance threshold the quality control methods designed in this study are based on the characteristics of the data itself previous studies usually use the manual labeling method or authoritative data such as remote sensing or field study data to improve the data quality for instance zeng et al 2020 manually filtered out 260 pieces of representative flood information from news data searched by baidu for flood susceptibility mapping de albuquerque et al 2015 used geotagged tweets combined with authoritative data to identify useful information for disaster management while the combination may introduce new uncertainties this study provides a new automated scheme based on data characteristics rather than resorting to other data sources to improve the data quality it is found that different quality control methods have different effects on flood susceptibility the frequency based method can improve the precision of the high flood susceptibility results by up to 5 however when the frequency threshold is set to 3 the performance gets worse it is presumably because there are not enough flood locations left to represent the whole area s susceptibility to flooding on the contrary the distance based method could not lead to a more accurate flood susceptibility the monotonically decreasing trend in the flood susceptibility precision with the increasing distance threshold implies that flood conditions may vary greatly within 500 m scale therefore over uniformly dispersed samples cannot reflect the heterogeneity of the urban area limited to the data accessibility of social media the amount of media data applied in this study is relatively small and the effectiveness of the proposed approach needs to be further verified for example the most effective frequency threshold is found as 2 in this study if the amount of data can be expanded the frequency threshold is expected to be increased there have been some studies aiming to utilize the big data from multiple media sources cervone et al 2016 used about 150 000 tweets including texts and images to assess transportation facilities damage during weather disasters and de bruijn et al 2019 selected 6 84 million tweets that mentioned a single settlement from 56 8 million media data to explore flood events social media contain valuable information to extract for natural science but also contain personal information that needs protection how to use social media safely and effectively calls for more studies in the future carrying out more case studies in other areas is also considered for future research the current development of news media platforms in various cities has greatly improved the universality of the approach proposed in this study the process of extracting flood locations may not be changed much in other applications but the data sources and flood conditioning factors should be selected according to the situations of the new study area 6 conclusion this study aims at using news media data to extract flood locations for urban flood susceptibility assessment an approach of three tasks was proposed extracting flood locations controlling data quality and mapping flood susceptibility firstly flood locations were extracted from news media data based on a ner model then a frequency or distance based data quality control method was used to improve the representativeness of the extracted flooded locations finally historical flood locations combined with flood conditioning factors were processed to input into an svm model for flood susceptibility assessment it took the central city of dalian china as a case to test the effectiveness of this approach it has been confirmed that the flood locations and the flood susceptibility map based on news media data are relatively accurate compared with an official planning report from the dalian planning department the distributions of most flood conditioning factors elevation slope twi precipitation and ndbi at flood locations extracted from news media data are not significantly different from those of the official report p values of a t test are all greater than 0 05 except for the distribution of the drainage density p value is 0 001 it implies that the representativeness of flood locations in the news is sufficient for flood susceptibility assessment as for the flood susceptibility map a high recall index of 90 indicates that most high hazard areas in the planning report have been identified as high susceptibility the mismatched high susceptibility areas were mostly distributed in the built up areas with low elevation and low drainage capacity six scenarios of data quality control were set to evaluate the effects of the frequency based and distance based methods it is concluded that the frequency based method can improve the precision of the flood susceptibility map by up to 5 but when the frequency threshold increases to 3 the performance of the flood susceptibility map gets worse when using distance based quality control methods all the evaluation indexes are negatively correlated to the distance threshold this study provides an example and offers the value of applying news data and modern deep learning techniques for urban flood management it is recommended that further research should expand data sources such as social media information published by individual users or take more case studies to enhance the application value of news media data credit authorship contribution statement shengnan fu investigation methodology

3047,flood susceptibility assessment for identifying flood prone areas plays a significant role in flood hazard mitigation machine learning is an optional assessment method because of its high objectivity and computational efficiency but how to get enough and accurate information of historical flood locations to train the machine learning models has been a key problem in recent years news media data from both news websites and social media accounts has emerged as a promising source for natural science studies however the application of news media data in urban flood susceptibility assessment is still inadequate this study proposed an approach to fill this gap firstly flood locations were extracted from news media data based on a named entity recognition ner model then a frequency or distance based data quality control method was employed to improve the representativeness of the extracted flooded locations finally flood conditioning factors with information of historical flood locations were input into a support vector machine svm model for flood susceptibility assessment we took the central city of dalian china as a case study the t test results show that there was no significant difference between the distributions of most flood conditioning factors at the flood locations from the news media data and the official planning report in the obtained flood susceptibility map the high flood susceptibility areas got a recall of 90 compared with the high flood hazard areas in the planning report performing data quality control in the frequency based method can improve the precision of the flood susceptibility map by up to 5 while the distance based method is ineffective this study provides an example and offers the value of applying new data sources and modern deep learning techniques for urban flood management keywords urban flood susceptibility news media data flood locations named entity recognition data quality control data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction floods cause significant environmental damage human casualties and economic loss worldwide arora et al 2021 according to swiss re institute sri in 2021 the global economic losses caused by floods reached 82 billion accounting for 31 of the global economic losses related to natural disasters as a natural phenomenon floods cannot be prevented completely but the damages can be mitigated by appropriate planning and management gao et al 2020 flood susceptibility assessment plays an important role in flood mitigation costache et al 2020 flood susceptibility defines the possibility of flooding in a certain area based on the geo environmental conditions fang et al 2021 different from the concept of flood hazard flood susceptibility reflects the intrinsic property of an area rather than the effect of a specific event a credible flood susceptibility map is a useful tool to identify flood prone areas and can provide effective guidance for decision makers to manage flood hazards bui et al 2020 flood susceptibility mapping is typically achieved using multi criteria decision making mcdm methods or machine learning methods mcdm methods such as the analytical hierarchy process ahp tella and balogun 2020 kazakis et al 2015 and vise kriterijumska optimizacijaik ompromisno resenje vikor khosravi et al 2019 mahato et al 2022 have been widely used by firstly determining the variables related to flooding and calculating the weight of each variable and then calculating the flood susceptibility based on the weighted variables however mcdm methods require the knowledge of the decision makers to make judgments about variables thus they are subjective and may lead to inappropriate decision making due to cognitive bias mudashiru et al 2021 by contrast machine learning methods can improve the objectivity of the flood susceptibility map through automatically establishing the relationships between the flood conditioning factors and the corresponding labels historical flood or non flooded locations the machine learning models can predict the flood susceptibility of unlabeled locations based on their conditioning factors commonly used algorithms include artificial neural networks anns zhao et al 2019 random forest rf islam et al 2021 support vector machine svm tehrany et al 2014 convolutional neural network cnn zhao et al 2020 logistic regression lr bui et al 2019 and long short term memory lstm fang et al 2021 among these methods svm has been applied by a series of previous studies tang et al 2021 tehrany et al 2015 in a natural basin tehrany et al 2015 compared the performances of svm and frequency ratio fr models and the results showed that the area under the curve auc of the receiver operating characteristic curve roc curve of the svm 84 97 was higher than that of the fr 61 43 which proved the classification ability of the svm as for the urban scenarios tang et al 2021 assessed flood susceptibility in guangzhou city and the svm also output relatively accurate results auc 0 84 the performance of machine learning methods relies heavily on the quantity and quality of the training data so getting enough and accurate information of historical flood locations has been a critical problem when machine learning methods are used the commonly used data sources include governmental reports hazarika et al 2016 tehrany et al 2019 newspapers archive baranowski et al 2020 rahmati et al 2020 field surveys talukdar et al 2020 tehrany et al 2015 and remote sensing observations costache et al 2020 wang et al 2019 among these sources governmental reports and field surveys are more accurate as they are generally derived from first hand data but they are time consuming to collect and cannot be updated in real time the remote sensing data has high spatial coverage but their accuracy is limited by the inversion methods of transferring the image information to the flood information and environmental conditions such as the cloud cover as for newspapers archive the authenticity and timeliness of news ensure the reliability of flood locations young 1990 but it takes effort and time to extract and digitize the effective information with the development of digital media platforms news media data have become a convenient data source for collecting flooded locations more and more traditional news media such as newspapers have set up online channels including news websites and social media accounts tarkiainen et al 2014 therefore news media data is a potentially promising resource for natural science avellaneda et al 2020 for example liu et al 2018 used news media data to extract and analyze information on the characteristics of natural disasters in china and found high co occurrence of meteorological and geological hazards guo et al 2022 built a methodological framework for news media datasets to track conflict and cooperation dynamics on transboundary rivers as one of the natural disasters that seriously affects the life of urban residents floods are also very concerned by the news media however there is still a lack of studies on using news media data for urban flood susceptibility assessment the application of massive news media data calls for a practical approach to extract flood locations automatically traditionally some researchers extract locations manually zeng et al 2020 which pays many human costs to ensure accuracy but lacks scientific and universal applicability another simple method is the rule based method which establishes matching rules to match the words in the text with a comprehensive set of location names de bruijn et al 2018 however there may be confusions when one name corresponds to multiple locations or other named entities like a person named entity recognition ner can automatically and accurately extract location names from news media data by analyzing the structure and grammar of text language the ner is an information extraction method for finding and sorting named entities into pre defined tags persons locations and organizations li et al 2018 researchers have applied several traditional machine learning methods such as hidden markov model hmm gayen and sarkar 2014 and conditional random field crf konkol and konopík 2013 for ner tasks the feature extraction process of these methods is cumbersome and cannot acquire ideal recognition results with a limited labeled training set in recent years deep learning has been applied to ner which can avoid tedious manual feature extraction as a typical example lample et al 2016 proposed a neural network model combining bidirectional long short term memory bilstm with crf for the ner task which showed its ability with a relatively high f1 score of 0 91 this study aims to use news media data to extract flood locations for urban flood susceptibility assessment two questions have been addressed 1 how accurate are the flood locations extracted from news media data and the corresponding calculated flood susceptibility map and 2 how to control the quality of flood locations and what effect does it have on the susceptibility results firstly we adopted a ner bilstm crf model to extract flood locations from news media data moreover two types of data quality control methods based on the frequency of the locations mentioned and the distance between every two locations respectively were applied to filter out several flood locations automatically finally urban flood susceptibility was calculated by an svm model the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the study area and data collected section 3 describes the methodology including extracting flood location controlling data quality and mapping flood susceptibility section 4 shows the results including the distribution of flood locations extracted from the news media data and the flood susceptibility maps after using different data quality control methods section 5 mainly discusses the findings and limitations of the study finally the conclusion is given in the last section 2 study area and data 2 1 study area in this study we selected the central city of dalian as the case site fig 1 the central city consists of four districts ganjingzi shahekou xigang and zhongshan with a total area of 550 27 km2 a warm temperate continental monsoon climate characterizes this area the average annual rainfall is 687 mm and 74 of the precipitation occurs in july and august this area is located along the coast and vulnerable to northward typhoons or severe convective weather which makes it susceptible to pluvial flooding 2 2 data collected the main goal of this study is to use news media data and a data driven model to map flood susceptibility therefore it is necessary to collect the news texts which contain the flood location information and multiple data sources which contain flood conditioning factors furthermore a related official report is collected to serve as the validation data 2 2 1 news media data the news media data used in this study were collected from both the social media platform sina weibo and the news website dalian newspaper online as for the social media platform we first searched for the texts under the dalian rainstorm topic to see where the texts came from then we found that the weibo account bandaochenbao contributed the most to this topic so we selected this account as the appropriate microblog data source and collected all its texts for extracting flood locations the account was created by an authoritative local newspaper sponsored by liaoning daily newspaper group called the peninsula morning news it provides timely coverage of social news and focuses on hot issues in people s livelihoods additionally dalian newspaper online the official digital website of the dalian news media group was used to supplement more news data it collects the news from many local newspapers such as dalian daily dalian evening news and northeast window the news media data we concerned were collected by different web crawlers which can automatically capture the contents on the website sina weibo application programming interface api was used for the social media platform and uniform resource locators urls of each news link were selected for the news website in summary the detailed information of the news media data collected in this study is shown in table 1 the original texts collected from sina weibo and dalian newspaper online contain extraneous characters such as spaces hyperlinks etc so text filtering is necessary as a pre processing procedure to remove these redundant texts and characters the filtering process was performed through the regular expression re module in python 2 2 2 flood conditioning factors six flood conditioning factors that quantify the topographical precipitation drainage and land use characteristics were collected to develop the model for flood susceptibility mapping fig 2 all the factors were standardized to 0 1 and converted to a matrix format as the input of the svm model the detailed information on the data source is given in table 2 and the definitions and reasons for choosing the six factors are described as follows 1 topographic factors topography is one of the major factors in evaluating flood prone areas wang et al 2015 different topography would lead to distinct hydrological processes in various areas chen et al 2020 shreekumar et al 2021 topographic factors are all extracted and calculated from the digital elevation model dem here including elevation slope and topographic wetness index twi sahana et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 the elevation is the basic factor directly extracted from the dem the slope is the maximum rate of change of the elevation value from one site to its neighbors in addition the twi indicates the tendency of flow under the influence of gravity and it was calculated using hydrology and raster surface tools in arcgis 10 2 as follows 1 t w i l n α tan β where α is the upslope area per unit contour length and tan β is the local gradient in the radians 2 precipitation factor precipitation has been identified as one of the significant causes of urban flooding islam et al 2021 here the average annual maximum daily precipitation between 2012 and 2019 same as the period of media data was used to characterize the precipitation in the study area 3 land use factor the distribution of land use especially impervious types also affects the formation of urban flooding wang et al 2021a b built up areas with a high impervious rate commonly yield more storm runoff zhao et al 2020 here the normalized difference built up index ndbi was selected as a land use factor to characterize imperviousness and it was calculated by eq 2 he et al 2010 from landsat 8 images in google earth engine 2 ndbi mir n i r mir n i r where mir is a middle infrared band and nir is a near infrared band in the landsat images 4 drainage factor the urban drainage system plays an essential role in flood discharge and areas with low urban drainage density are more prone to flooding rafiei sardooi et al 2021 in this study the drainage density was calculated by eq 3 lee et al 2018 to reflect the drainage system capacity 3 drainagedensity 1 s i 1 n l i where s is the area of each grid n is the number of pipes in the grid and l i is the length of each pipe within the grid 2 2 3 validation data to assess the reasonability of media data application an official planning report of stormwater management from the dalian planning department dpd was used for comparison this report was completed in 2014 and contained the historical flood locations obtained from field surveys and a validated flood hazard map produced by a mike urban model there were 47 historical flood locations frequently inundated in this report the mike urban model was developed with the underlying surface and pipe network data and simulated the maximum flooding depth of each drainage zone by inputting the 24 hour design rainfall of a 50 year return period as a result the maximum flooding depth of 16 of the study area exceeded 0 1 m and these areas were considered as the high level hazard area while the other 84 areas were regarded as the low level hazard area fig 3 3 methods an approach consisting of three tasks was proposed in this study extracting flood locations controlling data quality and mapping flood susceptibility fig 4 firstly flood locations were recognized by a ner bilstm crf model secondly a frequency based or distance based data quality control method was used to improve the representativeness of the extracted flooded locations at last the flood susceptibility map was generated with the help of an svm model 3 1 extracting flood locations extracting flood locations is the core task of the whole approach and it can be completed in three steps firstly characters from the microsoft research asia msra corpus which contains many labeled chinese sentences were collected and tagged as named entities representing persons locations and organizations they were transformed from the text form to a vector form before serving as training data secondly the ner model for flood location extraction was trained based on the msra corpus finally news texts collected were input into the trained ner model to extract the locations mentioned in the texts the recognized locations were checked manually through the baidu map coordinate picking system which returned geographic coordinates by searching for location names 3 1 1 data preparation for training the ner model the msra corpus is an available dataset for the chinese ner han et al 2021 it contains three types of named entities per person loc location and org organization per stands for pronouns that can be used to distinguish human being individuals loc denotes the exact position of something and org is where a group of people has been organized with specific aims and objectives such as a factory hospital and government department in this study the msra corpus was used as both the training and test sets and the number of each named entity in the dataset is shown in table 3 commonly used tagging methods for named entity recognition include the bio and bioes methods b represents the beginning of the named entity word i represents the inside part o represents the non entity word e means the end of the entity and s represents a single character entity although the difference in performance between the two methods is small wei et al 2021 the bioes annotation produces more labels which may undermine the efficiency of the ner model therefore the bio method was chosen for this study so that each character would match a label belonging to the set b per i per b loc i loc b org i org o since the ner model cannot directly manipulate symbolic languages such as text it is necessary to convert the text data into a numerical vector pham and le 2018 in this study texts were transformed into vector representations using one hot encoding which is widely used in ner tasks dai et al 2020 ji et al 2018 a one hot vector is a 1 n matrix vector in which all values are 0 except for a single 1 used to distinguish each character from every other character in the corpus arnaud et al 2021 3 1 2 the ner model bilstm crf the ner model in this study is a bilstm crf network consisting of three layers lample et al 2016 the first layer is a look up layer for transforming each character representation from a one hot vector into a lower dimensional vector representation secondly a bilstm layer is adopted to extract features from the input character vectors the third layer is a crf layer which labels the tag for each character based on the features extracted by the bilstm layer overall the input of the ner model is a sequence of characters x x1 x2 xn and the output is a predicted tag sequence y y1 y2 yn fig 5 illustrates how the bilstm crf works 1 look up layer in the look up layer character embedding was used to describe the characters by turning discrete one hot vectors into continuous variables embeddings reduce the spatial dimensionality of discrete variables and can better represent the relationships between different variables especially in the chinese ner task the character embedding method can avoid the performance degradation caused by the inaccuracy of the word segmentation chenhao and chengyao 2019 2 bilstm layer bilstm belongs to the group of lstms which is a variant of recurrent neural networks rnns unlike other rnn models that tend to be biased towards their most recent inputs in the sequence bengio et al 1994 the lstm can capture long temporal dependencies by incorporating a memory cell into the model structure lample et al 2016 as shown in fig 6 in the lstm network the memory cell captures critical information and stores it for a certain period tang et al 2020 each memory cell is connected recurrently with an input forget and output gate the computational principle of lstm is defined as follows 4 i t σ w x i x t w h i h t 1 w c i c t 1 w 0 i 5 f t σ w x f x t w h f h t 1 w c f c t 1 w 0 f 6 c t f t c t 1 i t tanh w x c x t w h c h t 1 w 0 c 7 o t σ w x o x t w h o h t 1 w c o c t 1 w 0 o 8 h t o t tanh c t where x t is the input σ is the sigmoid function it ft and ot are the outputs of the input forget and output gates respectively h represents the hidden state ct is the output of the cell gate constrained to the size of the hidden vector h t w and w0 are the bias vectors and weights respectively specific to the ner task two extra hidden layers should be included to process data in a bidirectional way xu et al 2019 this adaptation is known as a bilstm network graves and schmidhuber 2005 in the plain lstm network information would only flow in the forward direction and the hidden state h t depends only on the previous one h t 1 meaningful subsequent information would be wasted which might lead to the error in the information extraction for example dalian in the dalian city planning bureau may be mistakenly extracted as location but in fact it should be identified as organization from a global perspective with the bilstm network we can take forward direction and backward direction lstm for each character sequence and then combine the output so that the subsequent context can be accounted for 3 crf layer after the bilstm extracted the feature of input embedding crf was applied to get the optimal sequence of labels when we tag each character individually the sequence has its limitations for example logically the tag i per cannot follow the tag b loc bilstm is good at processing long distance context information but cannot handle the dependency between adjacent tags crf takes the order and correlations between labels into consideration to decode the labels thus can make up for the shortcoming of the bilstm through the crf layer the score of the output tag sequence y y1 y2 yn is defined as follows 9 s x y i 0 n a y i y i 1 i 1 n p i y i where a represents a square matrix of transition scores in the crf layer and a y i y i 1 represents the values of a transition from tag y i to tag y i 1 p is the output score matrix of the bilstm layer and p i y i represents the score of the character i belonging to the tag y i the output of the maximum score y obtained after decoding is 10 y a r g m a x log s o f t m a x s x y 3 1 3 model training the msra dataset labeled by the bio method was adopted to train and test the ner model the model parameters were optimized based on the training set and the trained model would be used to extract the location labels from news texts 3 1 4 model evaluation in this study the recall r precision p and f1 score f1 expressed as equations 11 13 were used to evaluate the performance of the ner model the values of these indexes range from 0 to 1 with higher values indicating better performance 11 p tp tp f p 12 r tp tp f n 13 f 1 2 p r p r where tp true positive represents the number of characters that are recognized as named entities and match the ground truth while fp false positive denotes the number of characters that are recognized as named entities but do not match the ground truth and fn false negative means the number of characters that are labeled as actual named entities but not recognized by the model 3 1 5 flood location extraction and verification once the ner model was trained the news media data were fed into the model to predict their labels through retrieval in the baidu map coordinate picking system the set of location labels is checked whether the corresponding geographical coordinates are within the study area if the corresponding coordinates are matched the location label is guaranteed to be correct in this way misclassified labels and locations of non study regions can be filtered out 3 2 data quality control in this study two data quality control methods based on the frequency or distance of flood locations are employed to improve the representativeness of the extracted flooded locations first as news texts include flood locations that have occurred only a few times due to specific conditions and may not reflect the characteristics of flood susceptibility we filtered the locations from news media by their frequency the frequency thresholds were set for the same location to appear 1 2 and 3 times in different news reports and locations with frequencies above the threshold are considered eligible and those below the threshold are filtered out on the other hand data quality control by the distance between each two flood locations was also investigated the aggregation of flood locations may be related to human activities which means that neighborhoods with higher crowd vitality indices or roads with higher traffic volumes receive more attention thus filtering by spatial distance is expected to undermine this effect considering that the spatial heterogeneity of the urban environment is greater than that of natural watersheds the threshold for sample spacing cannot be too large to capture features of flood prone areas according to the general neighborhood scale of the study area the distance thresholds were set to 500 m and 1 km flood locations separated by more than the threshold were considered eligible and otherwise removed 3 3 mapping flood susceptibility 3 3 1 flood susceptibility calculation the svm model was used to mine the mathematical relationship between the flooding conditions and susceptibility the entire study area was divided into 602 208 grids of 30 m 30 m consistent with the spatial resolution of the flood conditioning factors if a grid contains the coordinates of extracted flood locations it is considered a flooded location for training the same number of non flood locations as flood locations were selected artificially from local elevated and high drainage density areas zhao et al 2020 the flooded samples and non flooded samples were randomly partitioned into 70 and 30 groups as training sets and test sets upon completion of training the svm model the probability that non labeled grids belong to the flooded category or not would be predicted flood susceptibility was represented by the probability that each grid belongs to the classification of the flooded site then the study area was classified into different susceptibility zones representing five levels by the natural breaks method in arcgis jenks 1967 including very low low moderate high and very high the selection of a kernel type is essential for training the svm classification model damaševičius 2010 for this study the rbf kernel was selected based on its efficiency in previous related flood susceptibility research fang et al 2022 pradhan 2013 rahmati et al 2017 tehrany et al 2014 major parameters for optimization involved in the svm rbf training process included parameters c the regularization parameter and γ kernel width parameter c controls the trade off between training errors and margin and a low value of c may imply more training errors chen et al 2016 parameter γ adjusts the degree of non linearity of the svm model pradhan 2013 cross validation wang et al 2019 was adopted for this study to obtain the optimal parameter groups for each group the dataset was divided into six folds onefold was considered as the validation set and the remaining five folds were for training six validation accuracies could be obtained by rotating each fold as the validation set and the average of the six accuracies was taken as the cross validation accuracy cva for the group the group of parameters that achieved the highest cva was used in the final model the parameter optimization and model building were completed using the lib svm toolkit chang and lin 2001 in matlab r2014b 3 3 2 flood susceptibility evaluation the accuracy of the flood susceptibility map was evaluated by comparing it with the flood hazard map simulated by the mike urban model in the dpd official planning report to match up with the two levels of hazard the susceptibility results of the five levels were reclassified into two levels the high level includes the original very high and high susceptibility levels and the low level includes the others the precision and recall index were used to evaluate the performance of flood susceptibility mapping due to the imbalanced problem of the high level and low level areas in the flood hazard map the two indexes were only calculated for the high susceptibility areas which would greatly affect public safety and city function 4 results 4 1 flood locations extracted 4 1 1 the performance of the ner model the performance of the ner model trained and tested by the msra corpus was evaluated with the three evaluation indexes precision recall and f1 score as shown in table 4 the high f1 score for both the training set 0 88 and test set 0 85 indicates the effectiveness of the model in the ner of chinese texts wang et al 2021a b 4 1 2 flood locations extracted by the ner model in the news media data collected from both the weibo account named bandaochenbao and the dalian newspaper online website a total of 654 words were identified as the location tags by the ner model the tags in each news text were deduplicated to ensure that the same location in one piece of news was only counted once so that there were 183 of 654 location tags left after checking their corresponding geographical coordinates finally 136 flood locations were confirmed within the study area table 5 as shown in fig 7 only 14 of the 136 flood locations extracted from the news media data are overlapped with the 47 historical flood locations in the dpd planning report the reasons could be summarized as follows 1 the concerns of the two data sets are different the news media data mainly report the flood locations exposed to the public where the traffic or residents daily activities were influenced by the specific rainfall events in contrast the dpd planning report recorded repeated flood locations that caused serious economic or human losses therefore the number of flood locations extracted from news data significantly exceeds that of the dpd planning report 2 additionally the time ranges of the two data sets are different the news media data were collected during 2012 2019 while the dpd planning report was completed in 2014 to further ensure that the extracted flood locations are representative for subsequent flood susceptibility assessment we compared the flood conditioning factors at the flood locations from the news media data with the dpd planning report fig 8 a t test was carried out to evaluate the consistency of the distributions of the flood conditioning factors in which the p value greater than 0 05 means that the two distributions are not significantly different as a result p values of elevation slope twi precipitation ndbi and drainage density are 0 7 0 4 0 7 0 1 0 5 0 001 respectively it implied that all the flood conditioning factors show no significant difference except for the drainage density 4 1 3 flood locations filtered by data quality control as shown in fig 9 b d for the different frequency thresholds 1 2 and 3 the numbers of flood locations are 82 59 and 38 respectively the total flood locations with no quality control are mainly distributed in the northeast central and southeast as the frequency threshold increases the flood locations in the central part decrease the most with the distance threshold set as 500 m and 1 km the number of flood locations would be 83 and 48 respectively as shown in fig 9 e f as the distance threshold increases flood locations turn to be more uniformly distributed 4 2 flood susceptibility map the flood susceptibility map output by the svm model trained with the total flood locations is shown in fig 10 a the majority of the study area 33 is the very low susceptibility region which is more centralized in the west and southeast very high susceptibility class the probability of flooded category exceeding 0 81 and high susceptibility class the probability of flooded category between 0 62 and 0 81 covers nearly 20 and 18 of areas respectively and are mainly concentrated in the northern central and eastern areas the moderate the probability of flooded category between 0 40 and 0 62 and low susceptibility the probability of flooded category between 0 15 and 0 40 areas are more discrete the comparison results between the flood susceptibility map and the flood hazard map of the dpd planning report are shown in fig 11 b the reclassified high and low flood susceptibility classes account for 38 and 62 respectively fig 11 a while the high and low hazard areas account for 16 and 84 respectively fig 3 the high flood susceptibility areas obtain a recall of 90 compared with the high flood hazard areas but only with a precision of 36 4 3 impacts of quality control methods on flood susceptibility maps the flood susceptibility maps output by the svm model trained with the locations filtered by the five quality control scenarios are shown in fig 10 a f and each of them was compared with the flood hazard map table 6 in general the precision index has the opposite trend to the quantile of high susceptibility areas as for the frequency based method fig 10 b d the best performance is achieved with a frequency threshold of 1 or 2 f1 score 0 54 and the precision can be improved by up to 5 however when the frequency threshold is set to 3 the f1 score and precision both fall down when using distance based quality control methods fig 10 e f all the evaluation indexes are negatively correlated to the distance threshold 5 discussion this study verified news media data to be capable of supplementing historical flood inventory the objectivity and reality of the newspaper ensure the reliability of flood locations in news data furthermore despite there are differences between the flooding locations from the news and the dpd report the distributions of flood conditioning factors over the two sets are not significantly different from a statistical perspective which indicates that the two sets of locations have the same flood susceptibility characteristics the potential of using news media data to map urban flood susceptibility was also verified by this study the high flood susceptibility output by the svm model receives a high recall of 90 when compared with the high flood hazard map of the dpd report the area of high flood susceptibility is more than twice as large as that of the high hazard which caused the precision to be just 36 their differences can be understood by considering about their calculation methods the flood hazard is calculated based on the maximum flooding depth estimated by a mike urban model in which the flood comes from the overflow of the drainage network so we can find the flooding areas are mostly near the manholes fig 3 in comparison the svm can output the probability of flooding in any location based on their local flood conditioning factors specifically as shown in fig 10 b the high susceptibility areas distributed in the northern and eastern coastal areas which cover relatively low elevation low drainage density and high proportion of built up areas would not be identified as high hazard areas by the mike urban model to ensure the representativeness of the extracted flooded locations we proposed a series of quality control methods no matter based on the frequency or distance threshold the quality control methods designed in this study are based on the characteristics of the data itself previous studies usually use the manual labeling method or authoritative data such as remote sensing or field study data to improve the data quality for instance zeng et al 2020 manually filtered out 260 pieces of representative flood information from news data searched by baidu for flood susceptibility mapping de albuquerque et al 2015 used geotagged tweets combined with authoritative data to identify useful information for disaster management while the combination may introduce new uncertainties this study provides a new automated scheme based on data characteristics rather than resorting to other data sources to improve the data quality it is found that different quality control methods have different effects on flood susceptibility the frequency based method can improve the precision of the high flood susceptibility results by up to 5 however when the frequency threshold is set to 3 the performance gets worse it is presumably because there are not enough flood locations left to represent the whole area s susceptibility to flooding on the contrary the distance based method could not lead to a more accurate flood susceptibility the monotonically decreasing trend in the flood susceptibility precision with the increasing distance threshold implies that flood conditions may vary greatly within 500 m scale therefore over uniformly dispersed samples cannot reflect the heterogeneity of the urban area limited to the data accessibility of social media the amount of media data applied in this study is relatively small and the effectiveness of the proposed approach needs to be further verified for example the most effective frequency threshold is found as 2 in this study if the amount of data can be expanded the frequency threshold is expected to be increased there have been some studies aiming to utilize the big data from multiple media sources cervone et al 2016 used about 150 000 tweets including texts and images to assess transportation facilities damage during weather disasters and de bruijn et al 2019 selected 6 84 million tweets that mentioned a single settlement from 56 8 million media data to explore flood events social media contain valuable information to extract for natural science but also contain personal information that needs protection how to use social media safely and effectively calls for more studies in the future carrying out more case studies in other areas is also considered for future research the current development of news media platforms in various cities has greatly improved the universality of the approach proposed in this study the process of extracting flood locations may not be changed much in other applications but the data sources and flood conditioning factors should be selected according to the situations of the new study area 6 conclusion this study aims at using news media data to extract flood locations for urban flood susceptibility assessment an approach of three tasks was proposed extracting flood locations controlling data quality and mapping flood susceptibility firstly flood locations were extracted from news media data based on a ner model then a frequency or distance based data quality control method was used to improve the representativeness of the extracted flooded locations finally historical flood locations combined with flood conditioning factors were processed to input into an svm model for flood susceptibility assessment it took the central city of dalian china as a case to test the effectiveness of this approach it has been confirmed that the flood locations and the flood susceptibility map based on news media data are relatively accurate compared with an official planning report from the dalian planning department the distributions of most flood conditioning factors elevation slope twi precipitation and ndbi at flood locations extracted from news media data are not significantly different from those of the official report p values of a t test are all greater than 0 05 except for the distribution of the drainage density p value is 0 001 it implies that the representativeness of flood locations in the news is sufficient for flood susceptibility assessment as for the flood susceptibility map a high recall index of 90 indicates that most high hazard areas in the planning report have been identified as high susceptibility the mismatched high susceptibility areas were mostly distributed in the built up areas with low elevation and low drainage capacity six scenarios of data quality control were set to evaluate the effects of the frequency based and distance based methods it is concluded that the frequency based method can improve the precision of the flood susceptibility map by up to 5 but when the frequency threshold increases to 3 the performance of the flood susceptibility map gets worse when using distance based quality control methods all the evaluation indexes are negatively correlated to the distance threshold this study provides an example and offers the value of applying news data and modern deep learning techniques for urban flood management it is recommended that further research should expand data sources such as social media

3048,underground coal mining suffers from groundwater intrusion from the aquifers overlying coal seams therefore developing methods for the accurate prediction of roof water inflow is urgently needed to design a safe drainage system in this study we developed a novel upscaling framework to predict roof water inflow by integrating the multiscale hydrogeological properties of roof aquifers in this framework we imaged rock samples via scanning electron microscopy and performed pore scale analysis based on fractal theory a fractal model of permeability was introduced to calculate the seepage capacity of the pore structure in the samples the effect of fractures was further evaluated via core scale pneumatic experiments subsequently we derived an upscaling formula of hydraulic conductivity used for predicting roof water inflow at the field scale the proposed upscaling approach was demonstrated using data from a coal mine in northern china the results indicate that the actual water inflow 21 m3 h is within the predicted range of our upscaling framework 9 32 92 78 m3 h and the initial line fracture rate d x is distributed between 0 02 and 0 03 therefore these findings can guide the development of methods for considering micropores and fractures simultaneously and scaling them up to the field scale for effective prediction of water inflow from roof aquifers keywords fractal theory pore structure fractures upscaling equivalent hydraulic conductivity roof water inflow data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction coal is an important energy source as coal based thermal power accounts for 27 2 of the total global energy consumption dai and finkelman 2018 dale 2021 however coal mining operations could potentially lead to the flow of substantial volumes of groundwater into tunnels yihdego and paffard 2017 zhang et al 2017 resulting in the loss of life and property this renders the accurate prediction of water inflow critically important to ensure the safety of coal mining activity coal mining in north china faces two major water hazards groundwater intrusion from the underlying mao et al 2018 wu et al 2004 and overlying aquifers wu and zhou 2008 zhou et al 2022 recently the water inflow from roof aquifers has become a serious problem in china qu et al 2021 wu et al 2017 zeng et al 2018 hindering the progress of the coalmining industry lamoreaux et al 2014 wu et al 2015 moreover disturbances caused by coal mining increase the density and aperture of roof fractures which accelerates groundwater intrusion from roof aquifers wu and zhou 2008 zhao 1992 this is particularly pronounced in roof sandstone aquifers which favor hazardous conditions such as water storage and flow wu and zhou 2008 zhou et al 2017 field pumping tests have been widely used to reveal the hydraulic parameters of such formations which is essential for modeling the fate of groundwater in coal mining operations based on pumping tests mao et al 2018 used the field scale hydraulic tomography ht to map the distribution of hydraulic conductivity k in the xingdong coal mine however the large scale pumping tests cannot provide insights into the local hydraulic parameters moreover these tests are time consuming and expensive chen et al 2021 dai et al 2019 when the roof aquifer is not well fractured analysis of the drill core can help determine the local hydrogeologic properties and facilitate the understanding of roof water inflow into coal mines several pore scale studies have been conducted using core imaging techniques such as scanning electron microscopy sem and computed tomography ct to simulate water flow in actual pore structures chen and yao 2017 costa 2006 dong et al 2019 kelly et al 2014 latief and fauzi 2012 liu and ostadhassan 2017 vianna et al 2020 xu and yu 2008 zhao et al 2020 advancements in ct imaging techniques have enabled in situ non destructive extractions of 3d images of rock structures huaimin et al 2019 latief et al 2010 li et al 2019 nickerson et al 2019 for pore scale seepage simulation akhondzadeh et al 2020 chen et al 2015 jiang and tsuji 2017 liu et al 2009 okabe and blunt 2004 vianna et al 2020 which provides insights into the flow behavior in pore structures however these approaches are constrained by limited investigation volumes typically of the order of m m 3 trade off between resolution and field of view and simulation related computational challenges wang et al 2021 an alternative approach for studying the flow mechanism is to combine sem imaging blunt et al 2013 bultreys et al 2016 and fractal modeling dutta and tarafdar 2003 gao et al 2020 krohn and thompson 1986 liu et al 2018 shao et al 2017 which can access to the pore structure at a variety of scales bera et al 2011 klaver et al 2015 krohn and thompson 1986 li et al 2017 radlinski et al 2004 and are efficient in estimating rock permeability k davudov et al 2020 kelly et al 2014 klaver et al 2015 okabe and blunt 2004 song et al 2019 combined sem and fractal theory to describe the multiscale structures of shale pores while calculating their flow and transport properties yu et al 2019 incorporated fractal theory and capillary bundle models into a multi step interpretation framework of sem images to assess single phase fluid flow in pore structures subsequently dong et al 2020 introduced tortuosity into the fractal permeability model to improve its accuracy they showed that the model fails owing to a sharp increase in k caused by the existence of core scale fractures davudov et al 2020 reconstructed the 3d pore structure by stacking sem images to evaluate the interplay between k and pore connectivity ni et al 2021 analyzed the pore structure and k of sandstones based on fractal theory and sem images at different magnifications although previous studies demonstrated that k can be determined via 2d or 3d imaging of the pore structure of rock samples the influence of core scale fractures has not been adequately investigated berkowitz 2002 dai et al 2010 dietrich et al 2005 dong et al 2020 yu et al 2019 moreover the effect of scale differences between laboratory and field parameters is an important factor that should be considered when modeling fluid flow and mass transport in geological formations apourvari and arns 2016 ayirala et al 2020 dai et al 2005 2007 2008 2009 galvao et al 2016 soltanian et al 2015a 2018 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021b hassan et al 1997 and neuman 1990 established a large scale k based on deterministic concepts assuming homogeneity in geologic units when sufficient field survey data are available the fine scale information can be projected onto coarse scale blocks furthermore stochastic theory was developed to obtain the spatial probability distribution of field scale k based on the statistical characteristics of the smaller scale considering the heterogeneity of subsurface formations dagan et al 2013 li et al 2011 rubin and gómez hernández 1990 zhang et al 2021b however stochastic methods are not effective for subsurface media with large spatial covariances because geological measurements are required to capture statistical structures zhang et al 2021b thus li and xing 2016 used the k model with a random distribution to test three traditional mean methods and proposed a new statistical algorithm to determine the equivalent k of coal samples in addition solute transport parameters in porous media such as dispersivity diffusion and sorption coefficients have been up scaled in simulations involving geochemical and biological reactions chew and law 2020 dai et al 2007 dai et al 2009 giammar and hering 2001 klotz et al 1980 reimus and callahan 2007 rolle et al 2013 soltanian et al 2015b zech et al 2015 dai et al 2007 proved that the field scale diffusion coefficient d m could be determined via statistical analysis of laboratory scale in d m and increased with the integral scale they further derived scaling equations for upscaling sorption coefficients which was verified by monte carlo simulations dai et al 2009 evidently upscaling approaches have been widely used in diverse practical applications for modeling flow and transport behaviors at the field scale with a reasonable computational cost however their application to the mine water inflow prediction remains limited to address this gap this study develops an upscaling framework integrating multiscale void structures micropores and core fractures and fracture statistical parameters to obtain a field scale k for predicting water inflow from 2 coal roof sandstone aquifers in the xingdong mine north china the fractal characteristics of the pore structure are analyzed based on sem imaging of sandstone samples and the flow capacity of groundwater through the pore space is evaluated using a fractal permeability model the contribution of core scale fractures to fluid flow on larger scales is quantified by inversing the effective fracture aperture b x furthermore a formula that incorporates the statistical characteristics of pores and fractures is derived to upscale k from pore and core scales to the field scale this formula is verified based on the large diameter well method the effectiveness of the upscaling approach for the water inflow prediction is confirmed through comparison with previously observed data the findings of this study have important implications for the use of borehole cores to characterize the field spatial variability of the k of roof sandstone aquifers at an affordable cost 2 study site the xingdong coal mine is located to the east of xingtai city hebei province china fig 1 the surface of the mine area is completely covered by quaternary loose sediments the strata are as follows from older to newer ordovician carboniferous permian triassic tertiary and quaternary moreover the coal bearing strata in the mine are as follows from deep to shallow middle carboniferous benxi formation upper carboniferous taiyuan formation and lower permian shanxi formation the mean thickness of these strata is 217 13 m with 15 coal bearing seams numbered in order from top to bottom as 1 2 2down 3up 3 4down 5up 5 6 6down 7up 7 8 9 and 10 the shanxi formation which belongs to transitional clastic sedimentary strata has a rich variety of plant fossils and is one of the main coal bearing seams in the mine the 2 coal seam in the formation is the main mined coal seam owing to its stability mineability and abundance xiashihezi formation is the strata overlying 2 coal seam it is 64 m thick and comprises grey and greyish green mudstone and siltstone with greyish white fine sandstone moreover the sandstone in the formation is primarily composed of quartz and feldspar with muddy cementation and undeveloped primary fractures fig 2 three aquifer groups are identified in the mining area ordovician limestone carboniferous limestone and permian sandstone aquifer groups the direct water source that threatens the safety of 2 coal production is in the aquifers overlying the 2 coal seam including shanxi formation and xiashihezi formation sandstone aquifers both aquifers are dominated by mud cemented medium fine sandstones and belong to the permian sandstone aquifer group the average thickness of the shanxi formation sandstone aquifer is approximately 8 05 m and the groundwater stored in this thin aquifer could be drained quickly by contrast the average thickness of the xiashihezi formation aquifer is approximately 19 8 m and the groundwater in the aquifer continues to flow into the mine along the hydraulic fracture zone when mining 2 coal seam the primary fractures in the aquifer could grow in density and aperture because of stratigraphic disturbances resulting in an increase in the amount of roof water inflow although the xingdong mine has conducted an in depth investigation of the floor limestone aquifers and floor water inrush roof water inflow has not yet been sufficiently studied therefore we selected the xiashihezi formation sandstone aquifer as our target strata from which eight sandstone rocks were sampled and marked from txl01 to txl08 in sequence the sandstone rocks from the xiashihezi formation were selected from four different boreholes and also at different depths to ensure that the rock samples adequately represent for this study site although considering more borehole cores would help describe the aquifer more accurately we focused on roof water inflow at the early stages of 2 coal mining during which the number of suitable cores in the core library is relatively limited 3 methods 3 1 pore scale analyses eight sandstone samples were imaged using sem to estimate the k of the pore structure in the roof sandstone aquifer two thin sections were prepared for each sample and a total of 16 thin sections were obtained with length width and thickness of 1 cm 1 cm 1 mm respectively the samples were prepared before loading the thin sections to observe the pore structure as follows 1 soaking the samples in pure ethanol to remove organic impurities 2 using an air pump to remove inorganic impurities from sample surfaces 3 gold spraying of samples to enhance the conductivity of the sandstone surface for sem imaging subsequently 89 images were acquired using a field emission sem s 4800 hitachi japan and used in the statistical analysis of pore structure characteristics the processing of sem images was introduced in detail in our previous study dong et al 2020 and includes the following three main steps 1 removal of gaussian noise generated during image acquisition and transmission using a wiener adaptive filter 2 extraction of pores from the background by determining the appropriate threshold to segment the sem images and 3 acquisition of pore geometry parameters such as pore perimeter and area based on geometric statistical algorithms the pore geometry parameters and pore size distribution psd were determined in post processing steps subsequently fractal theory was employed for describing the pore structure of the sample owing to its ability to characterize complex systems karimpouli and tahmasebi 2019 cai et al 2015 xia et al 2018 the fractal system exhibits approximate self similarity i e the pore perimeter s is proportional to the d 2 power of the pore area a at different scales as expressed in the following equation yu et al 2019 1 s δ a 0 δ 1 d 1 a δ d 2 c 0 a δ d 2 where a 0 is a constant related to the rock pore structure δ is the measurement scale of pore perimeters and areas c 0 is the fractal coefficient expressed as c 0 a 0 δ 1 d 1 and d is the fractal dimension which reflects the complexity of the pore structure the pore space consists of a series of curved capillaries jiang et al 2017 watanabe and flury 2008 and is assumed as capillary bundles in which groundwater flows and transports fig 3 the hagen poiseuille equation is used to describe the steady flow of an incompressible viscous fluid in a horizontal circular tube zhang et al 2021a combining it with darcy s law a fractal model of the following form was introduced to estimate k dong et al 2020 2 k 2 π m 4 i 1 n a i 4 2 d τ a where k is the permeability which represents the resistance of porous media and is independent of fluid properties m is expressed as m 1 c 0 where c 0 is the fractal coefficient τ is the geometric tortuosity related to the porosity of the porous media a i denotes the area of i th pore a denotes the total cross sectional area and n represents the number of capillary bundles in a groundwater flow in the pore space is subject to the directional resistance of solid particles and relative resistance of fluid flow reagan et al 2015 berre et al 2019 hou et al 2021 this implies that k depends not only on the intrinsic properties of the porous media but also on the fluid properties as expressed by the following equation 3 k ρ g μ k where ρ is the fluid density g is the gravitational acceleration k is the intrinsic permeability and μ is the dynamic viscosity combining eqs 2 and 3 yields 4 k p 2 π ρ g m 4 i 1 n a i 4 2 d μ τ a where k p is the hydraulic conductivity of the pore structure and is related to the geometric and fractal characteristics of the pore structure and the fluid properties 3 2 core scale experiments in a fractured porous medium fpm k values depend on the structural characteristics of pores and fractures such as pore size distribution pore connectivity fracture aperture fracture density and dip angles adler et al 2013 karimpouli and tahmasebi 2019 in particular the fracture aperture is a key parameter in controlling fluid flow and transport in such aquifers however direct measurements of the fracture aperture at the core scale remains challenging berkowitz 2002 wang et al 2015 core scale experiments can help determine the contribution of fractures to the overall flow characteristics of rock samples adler et al 2013 singhal and gupta 2010 in this study k and were measured for following three purposes 1 assessing the capacity of the fluid flow in the pore structure 2 verifying the fractal k model by the data measured at the core scale and 3 quantifying the contribution of fractures to k by combining the fractal model of the pore structure gas is typically used for fast rock k measurements dietrich et al 2005 singhal and gupta 2010 in this study helium was chosen as the test fluid and and k were measured by an overburden porosity permeability meter ap 608 fig 4 specifically boyle s law was used to obtain the void volume of the sample moreover k was determined based on the gas pulse attenuation theory the gas slippage effect was also considered meng et al 2021 in addition an unsteady measurement technology was applied to ensure stable pressure attenuation in the measured sample 3 3 upscaling for hydraulic conductivity the conceptual models describing fpm mainly include the equivalent porous media model and the discrete fracture network model the latter is limited by the large amount of required data which are difficult to acquire adler et al 2013 berkowitz 2002 when the representative elementary volume rev of the fpm is large enough to maintain the stability of averaged geophysical properties the dual medium of pores and fractures can be homogenized into an equivalent porous media enabling an upscaling process from experimental analysis to field application singhal and gupta 2010 faybishenko et al 2015 reagan et al 2015 to scale up k the hydraulic conductivity of the pore and fracture structure should be considered additionally the mass conservation equation of the total volume discharge q through the rev of fpm should be established the k p has been introduced in section 3 1 next the flow of fluids in the fracture and the expression for the hydraulic conductivity of a single fracture are introduced as shown in fig 5 a natural fracture consists of rough surfaces on both sides of the rock with a non constant aperture faybishenko et al 2015 for multiphase flow variations in fracture aperture result in an uneven distribution of entry pressure which significantly affects seepage simulations dietrich et al 2005 singhal and gupta 2010 only one fluid phase i e the liquid phase was considered in this study the natural fracture can be simplified as two plane parallel plates with a constant aperture throughout the entire fracture fig 5 in the parallel plate model the hydraulic walls of the fracture are assumed to be smooth and the fluid flow between the two parallel plates is assumed to be laminar using darcy s law k of the parallel plate model is expressed as follows 5 k f ρ g 12 μ b 2 where k f represents the hydraulic conductivity of the fracture and b is the distance between two plates that represents the fracture aperture considering the combined effect of pores and fractures the upscaling formula of the k can be established based on the law of conservation of mass fig 6 a shows the rev of the fpm whose length width and thickness are represented by l x l y and m respectively the rev comprises pores matrix and n fractures with different apertures ranging from b x 01 to b x 0 n line fracture rate d x refers to the proportion of fractures per unit length in the direction perpendicular to the fracture strike in the rev d x can be expressed as the ratio of the sum of fracture apertures to the width of the rev to upscale k the dual medium of pores and fractures can be generalized as an equivalent porous medium fig 6b this simplified concept is justified by the fact that the water inflow prediction only focuses on the total volume discharge q and the final loss of hydraulic head and not on the distribution of hydraulic head flow direction and velocity at any time berkowitz 2002 subsequently assuming that the equivalent porous medium is homogeneous and isotropic the flux balance equation is obtained as follows 6 q 0 d x l y k f d h x d l x m d y 0 l y d x l y k p d h x d l x m d y 0 l y k d h x d l x m d y where k f is the hydraulic conductivity of the fractured medium k p is the hydraulic conductivity of the pore medium k is the equivalent hydraulic conductivity and d h x d l x denotes the hydraulic gradient in the l x direction this equation can also be expressed as 7 k f d h x d l x b x m k p d h x d l x l y b x m k d h x d l x l y m where k f is the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of the fractured medium k p is the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of the pore medium and b x denotes the effective aperture of fractures in the rev of fpm the first term on the left side represents the water flux through the fractured medium which is expressed as 8 k f d h x d l x b x m i 1 n k fi b 0 i d h x d l x m 0 d x l y k f b x d y d h x d l x m taking the natural logarithms of b x and supposing b y ln b x we obtain 9 k f d h x d l x b x m 0 d x l y k f b x d y d h x d l x m 0 d x l y k f e b y d y d h x d l x m making the use of eq 5 and b x e b y yields 10 k f d h x d l x b x m 0 d x l y k f e b y d y d h x d l x m ρ g 12 μ 0 d x l y e 3 b y d y d h x d l x m according to the perturbation formulation gelhar and axness 1983 b y can be expressed in terms of the mean b y and perturbation b y and eq 10 becomes 11 k f d h x d l x b x m ρ g 12 μ 0 d x l y e 3 b y d y d h x d l x m ρ g 12 μ 0 d x l y e 3 b y b y d y d h x d l x m where e b y 0 and b y is the mean aperture of fractures in the rev considering b y ln b x we know b y ln b x and it is also a constant substituting and integrating the term of e 3 b y produce the following expression 12 k f d h x d l x b x m ρ g 12 μ b x 3 0 d x l y e 3 b y d y d h x d l x m taylor expansion of the e 3 b y term yields 13 k f d h x d l x b x m ρ g 12 μ b x 3 0 d x l y 1 3 b y 3 b y 2 2 3 b y 3 3 d y d h x d l x m subsequently by integrating the first three terms of eq 13 the eq 13 can be approximated as 14 k f d h x d l x b x m ρ g 12 μ b x 3 d x l y 1 9 2 σ b y 2 d h x d l x m where d x denotes the line fracture rate and σ b y 2 represents the variance of the natural logarithmic aperture of the fracture by replacing k p in eq 7 with eq 4 the water flux through the pore medium can be expressed as 15 k p d h x d l x l y b x m 2 π ρ g m 4 i 1 n a i 4 2 d μ τ a d h x d l x l y b x m considering b x l y the k of fpm is approximately expressed as 16 k ρ g 12 μ l y b x 3 d x l y 1 9 2 σ b y 2 2 π ρ g m 4 i 1 n a i 4 2 d μ τ a considering eq 5 eq 14 can be expressed as 17 ρ g 12 μ b x 3 d h x d l x m ρ g 12 μ b x 3 d x l y 1 9 2 σ b y 2 d h x d l x m therefore the expression of b x in the fractured medium is 18 b x b x d x l y 1 9 2 σ b y 2 1 3 from eq 16 k can be determined via pore structure analysis and fracture characteristics statistics in the early stage of 2 coal mining the primary fractures of the roof aquifer in xingdong mine are not well developed liu 2006 and b x cannot be determined by eq 18 as it is too small to be measured accurately we combined eqs 5 and 7 and developed a multistep model for inverting b x which is expressed as follows 19 b x 12 μ k k p l y ρ g 1 3 to determine b x we prepared cylindrical samples of approximately 2 5 cm in diameter and height for core scale experiments which were imaged via sem in eq 19 k was obtained via pneumatic experiments using rock samples with fractures k p was determined from a model based interpretation of sem images and l y representing the sample diameter was approximately 2 5 cm when b x is known eq 16 can be simplified as follows 20 k ρ g 12 μ l y b x 3 2 π ρ g m 4 i 1 n a i 4 2 d μ τ a k f d x k p where d x is the line fracture rate which can be determined based on fracture statistics using field data in eq 20 three different scale methods are required to determine k namely pore scale analysis core scale experiments and field statistics 3 4 large diameter well method for water inflow prediction the k value obtained from the upscaling framework was used to predict the mine water inflow of 2 coal roof sandstone aquifer in xingdong mine various methods exist for predicting mine water inflow such as analytical numerical water balance and artificial neural networks guo et al 2009 li et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 the large diameter well method is an analytical method that is developed from dupuit formulas and has been widely used in predicting mine water inflow owing to its high speed strong adaptability and high precision li et al 2014 hou 2013 groundwater is considered to flow into a large well at the center of mines a detailed description of the large well method is included in appendix a from which we know the large well formulas of confined unconfined steady flow under orthogonal water supply condition are as follows chen et al 2011 21 q π k 2 h 0 m m h w 2 r a 22 r a ln b 1 b 2 r 0 b 1 2 b 2 2 23 r 0 η a b 4 where q is the mine water inflow k is the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer m is the thickness of the confined aquifer h 0 is the water level of the confined aquifer h w is the water level of the unconfined aquifer r 0 is the reference radius b 1 and b 2 are the distances from the large well to the supply boundary respectively a and b are the length and width of the rectangular tunnel respectively and the value of coefficient η depends on the value of a b shown in table a 3 4 results and discussions 4 1 pore structure characteristics we evaluated the cumulative percentage of psd for the eight sandstone samples using sem image analysis as shown in fig 7 the number of pores decreases with the increasing pore size in addition more than 88 of pore radius values were less than 100 nm indicating that the psd was relatively dispersed and the pore structure was not well developed the txl06 sample had the lowest cumulative psd percentage below 50 nm at approximately 46 whereas the txl08 sample had the largest cumulative psd percentage of approximately 76 5 in particular for the txl07 sample all pore sizes were distributed below 200 nm with 76 of the pore sizes below 50 nm the degree of the pore structure development in the roof sandstone aquifer of the xingdong mine was estimated based on statistical analysis of the psd of the samples furthermore we employed fractal geometry to quantitatively evaluate the pore structure of the eight samples we first determined the area and perimeter of all pores using image processing techniques subsequently the power function was used to fit the data of the pore areas and perimeters fig 8 giving the fractal dimension d and fractal coefficient c 0 of the pore structure of the samples using eq 1 table 1 substituting the fractal parameters d and c 0 into eq 2 we obtained theoretical k values of the pore structure of sandstone samples table 1 as is evident from the results in table 1 the mean coefficient of determination r 2 is greater than 0 90 and the fractal dimension values d are in the range of 1 0 1 3 high r 2 indicated that a strong correlation between the pore areas and perimeters and strong fractal characteristics of the samples pore structure the fractal dimension d is an important indicator of the effectiveness of the space occupied by complex objects the larger its value the more complicated the fractal system in table 1 the mean d value is 1 15 suggesting that the pore structure of the samples in the 2 coal roof sandstone aquifer of xingdong coal mine is poorly developed which is consistent with the measured results of pneumatic experiments the smallest d value was observed in the txl07 sample 1 07 and the largest value was in txl02 sample 1 21 since the eight samples all came from the 2 coal roof sandstone aquifer they do not differ significantly in d values and have similar fractal properties meanwhile the theoretical k values obtained by the pore scale analysis were in the range of 0 37 3 75 10 2 m d with a mean value of 2 00 10 2 m d the txl07 sample had the lowest theoretical k value of 0 37 10 2 m d whereas the txl03 sample had the highest value of 3 75 10 2 m d as is evident from fig 7 the pore sizes of the txl07 sample were below than 200 nm and mostly less than 50 nm therefore the txl07 sample exhibited the lowest k and d value large pores control the flow of fluids in porous media the txl03 sample had the highest percentage of pores in the 200 310 nm interval resulting in the largest theoretical k value thus with similar fractal characteristics the distribution of large pore sizes is a key factor influencing groundwater flow in porous media in this study the pore scale analysis of the samples is the minimum scale to characterize the permeability of underground formations in the mine area 4 2 permeability measured at core scale following the analysis of the pore structure larger scale pneumatic experiments were performed to examine flow properties of the 2 coal roof sandstone aquifer the results showed that the measured values were less than 9 and the samples have a poorly developed pore structure this conclusion was consistent with the findings of the aforementioned fractal analysis using the sem images furthermore the measured k values ranged from 0 40 to 2926 50 10 2 m d with the k values of the txl03 and txl05 samples being three orders magnitude higher than those of the other six sandstone samples the fractures in the txl03 and txl05 samples were found via observations dong et al 2020 the high k values resulted from the joint action of pores and fractures at different scales the results in table 2 show that the txl03 sample had the second smallest value and the largest k value suggesting that the fracture causes a sharp increase in k values and plays an important role in fluid flow in the fpm the effect of core scale fractures must be considered in the prediction of mine water inflow for the samples without fractures k values exhibited a good correlation with the values listed in table 2 moreover the psd also affects k values for example the txl08 sample does not have the largest value but has the largest k value because it has the highest percentage of pores larger than 250 nm the k values were determined based on the pore structure and the measured data obtained by the core scale pneumatic experiments was used to verify the fractal k prediction model the fractal k model was evaluated using measured data table 3 results showed that the model errors are in the range of 3 33 11 52 with a mean error less than 10 when quantifying the contribution of fractures to k the effect of the pore structure due to the coexistence of pores and fractures in the rock samples should be eliminated as is evident from the results in table 3 the accuracy of the fractal k model was sufficient to remove the effect of pore structure and thus effectively invert the contribution of fractures to fluid flow in the fpm notably all predicted k values were smaller than the measured values in eq 2 the k value was negatively correlated to the tortuosity τ low values of imply high values of τ which is why all predicted k values were lower than the measured values in predicting the k values of the pore structure sufficient pores captured via sem are required to accurately characterize the size distribution and fractal properties despite the advantages of sem in terms of field of view it fails to map the spatial connectivity of the pore structure thus future research should focus on the flow behavior and properties of fluids in 3d structures to understand the origins of the prediction errors 4 3 determination of hydraulic conductivity before predicting water inflow the k of roof sandstone aquifer should be determined based on pore scale analysis core scale pneumatic experiments and field statistics of fracture characteristics liquid density ρ and dynamic viscosity coefficient μ vary with temperature based on the assumption of the groundwater temperature of 20 c all measured k values were converted to k values using eq 3 averaging k p of the six samples we determined the k p of the roof aquifer as 1 32 10 5 m d for txl03 and txl05 samples the measured k values were essentially converted to k values rather than k f or k p values because of the coexistence of pores and fractures in them to determine k f b x values must be known and the b x values of these samples were too small at the microscale to be directly measured using conventional instruments therefore we inverted the b x of txl03 and txl05 samples by substituting three parameters of k k p and l y into eq 18 in which k p was determined based on the fractal k model results are shown in table 4 and the mean b x value of two samples is 18 9 μ m substituting it into eq 5 k f was determined as 25 2 m d in addition through field investigations and literature review we determined that the fractures in the 2 coal roof sandstone aquifer were not well developed the d x ranged from 0 01 to 0 1 in the early stage of 2 coal mining du 2006 the k p k f and d x of the roof aquifer had been determined using pore scale analysis core scale pneumatic experiments and field scale investigations respectively substituting them into eq 20 we obtained the k values which ranged from 0 25 to 2 52 10 2 m d as listed in table 5 when k p and k f are determined k grows linearly with d x and thus d x is the key parameter that determines the k value of the roof aquifer as the coal is mined d x could increase because of the generation of tiny fractures that is caused by disturbances and stress changes in the formations overlying coal seams given that b x remains constant statistics of d x in underground coal mines are crucial for tracking the amount of roof water inflow during the mining process if b x grows and is easily measured b x should be determined by the statistical fracture characteristics such as b x and σ b y 2 instead of inverting using eq 19 here the b x value was inversed by laboratory experiments of sandstone samples due to the undeveloped fractures in the roof sandstone aquifer 4 4 prediction of mine water inflow after the k value was determined we calculated the mine water inflow using the large well formula the hydrogeological conceptual model of the xingdong coal mine was established based on the geological survey report liu 2006 as shown in fig 1 the xingdong coal mine is located between the f19 and f 23 faults the 750 m working face in the no 1 mining area of the 2 coal was selected for the water inflow prediction the f2 fault in the east and the f 23 fault in the south were considered as infinite boundaries because both were not entirely cut off from the 2 coal roof sandstone aquifer the f1 fault was hydraulically connected to the ordovician limestone aquifer which can be generalized as the water supply boundary moreover the f19 fault is bordered by the ordovician limestone aquifer which can be considered as the water conduction boundary owing to the existence of water conducting fractured zone after the drainage of 2 coal roof aquifer the central aquifer of the mining area changed from confined water to unconfined water whereas the confined water far from the center of the mining area remained unchanged the aquifer was essentially a confined unconfined aquifer therefore eq 21 was used to predict mine roof water inflow based on the aforementioned hydrogeological conceptual model the k in eq 21 was taken as the k value of the 2 coal roof sandstone aquifer other parameters in eq 21 were all obtained from a geological survey report of the xingdong coal mine du 2006 the value of each parameter and the predicted results of roof water inflow are listed in table 6 the results showed that the predicted value of the roof water inflow was between 9 32 m3 h and 92 78 m3 h when d x ranged from 0 01 to 0 1 the actual water inflow 21 m3 h at the primary stage of mining 2 coal was between 18 59 m3 h and 27 87 m3 h which falls within the predicted range of 9 32 92 78 m3 h and its corresponding d x was in the range of 0 02 0 03 fig 9 these results indicate that the proposed upscaling framework is valid and effective for predicting the mine water inflow of 2 coal roof sandstone aquifer in xingdong mine mining of coal seams results in an increase in the amount of roof water inflow with increasing d x when assessing the safety of coal production we should focus on the spreading of fractures in the overlying aquifers of coal seams for preventing the surge of mine water inflow from roof aquifers notably the growth of the fracture aperture b x could lead to a significant increase in the roof water inflow the generation and development of fractures provide flow channels for groundwater which is the underlying reason for water inflow incidents in mining production although the pore structure of roof aquifers has a limited role in the rapid inflow of roof water into the mine it is the storage space for groundwater and determines the total volume of water inflow in the absence of recharge the interaction between pores and fractures should be investigated to prevent water inflow incidents during coal mining 5 summary and conclusions in this study an upscaling framework was developed to integrate the multiscale hydrogeological properties of roof aquifers in the coal mine including microscopic pores core scale fracture geometry and field scale fracture distributions for predicting water inflow from roof sandstone aquifers to mines the 2 coal roof sandstone aquifer in the xingdong coal mine was selected as a representative example to verify the upscaling framework the key conclusions are summarized as follows 1 pore scale analysis results showed that the pore structure of the samples exhibits fractal characteristics and the low fractal dimension d revealed the poorly developed pore structure in the roof sandstone aquifer of xingdong mine 2 core scale experiments results indicated that the fractures existed in the samples resulting in a sharp increase in k values moreover the k model was verified and the accuracy was sufficient to invert the effective aperture b x 3 b x was the crucial parameter for upscaling k in the fractured formations the growth of b x could result in a significant inrush of groundwater threatening the safety of workers in coal mining we can determine the b x value by the statistical fracture characteristics in combination with eq 18 or by the multistep inversion model of eq 19 4 when the line fracture rate d x was distributed between 0 01 and 0 1 the corresponding roof water inflow ranged from 9 32 m 3 h to 92 78 m 3 h coal mining triggers fractures leading to increased d x when b x is constant the statistics of d x is essential to keep track of the amount of roof water inflow accurate characterization of the multi scale fracture properties is key to the effective prediction of mine water inflow from the fractured porous aquifers for the coal mine considered in our study more field investigations of outcrops in the target strata and geophysical explorations of underground aquifer features will help us understand the field scale hydrogeological properties of the roof aquifers moreover laboratory analyses regional geophysical surveys and field pumping tests should be combined to reduce the uncertainty in field scale aquifer parameters and ensure the accuracy of water inflow prediction in the mining area credit authorship contribution statement lulu xu conceptualization methodology

3048,underground coal mining suffers from groundwater intrusion from the aquifers overlying coal seams therefore developing methods for the accurate prediction of roof water inflow is urgently needed to design a safe drainage system in this study we developed a novel upscaling framework to predict roof water inflow by integrating the multiscale hydrogeological properties of roof aquifers in this framework we imaged rock samples via scanning electron microscopy and performed pore scale analysis based on fractal theory a fractal model of permeability was introduced to calculate the seepage capacity of the pore structure in the samples the effect of fractures was further evaluated via core scale pneumatic experiments subsequently we derived an upscaling formula of hydraulic conductivity used for predicting roof water inflow at the field scale the proposed upscaling approach was demonstrated using data from a coal mine in northern china the results indicate that the actual water inflow 21 m3 h is within the predicted range of our upscaling framework 9 32 92 78 m3 h and the initial line fracture rate d x is distributed between 0 02 and 0 03 therefore these findings can guide the development of methods for considering micropores and fractures simultaneously and scaling them up to the field scale for effective prediction of water inflow from roof aquifers keywords fractal theory pore structure fractures upscaling equivalent hydraulic conductivity roof water inflow data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction coal is an important energy source as coal based thermal power accounts for 27 2 of the total global energy consumption dai and finkelman 2018 dale 2021 however coal mining operations could potentially lead to the flow of substantial volumes of groundwater into tunnels yihdego and paffard 2017 zhang et al 2017 resulting in the loss of life and property this renders the accurate prediction of water inflow critically important to ensure the safety of coal mining activity coal mining in north china faces two major water hazards groundwater intrusion from the underlying mao et al 2018 wu et al 2004 and overlying aquifers wu and zhou 2008 zhou et al 2022 recently the water inflow from roof aquifers has become a serious problem in china qu et al 2021 wu et al 2017 zeng et al 2018 hindering the progress of the coalmining industry lamoreaux et al 2014 wu et al 2015 moreover disturbances caused by coal mining increase the density and aperture of roof fractures which accelerates groundwater intrusion from roof aquifers wu and zhou 2008 zhao 1992 this is particularly pronounced in roof sandstone aquifers which favor hazardous conditions such as water storage and flow wu and zhou 2008 zhou et al 2017 field pumping tests have been widely used to reveal the hydraulic parameters of such formations which is essential for modeling the fate of groundwater in coal mining operations based on pumping tests mao et al 2018 used the field scale hydraulic tomography ht to map the distribution of hydraulic conductivity k in the xingdong coal mine however the large scale pumping tests cannot provide insights into the local hydraulic parameters moreover these tests are time consuming and expensive chen et al 2021 dai et al 2019 when the roof aquifer is not well fractured analysis of the drill core can help determine the local hydrogeologic properties and facilitate the understanding of roof water inflow into coal mines several pore scale studies have been conducted using core imaging techniques such as scanning electron microscopy sem and computed tomography ct to simulate water flow in actual pore structures chen and yao 2017 costa 2006 dong et al 2019 kelly et al 2014 latief and fauzi 2012 liu and ostadhassan 2017 vianna et al 2020 xu and yu 2008 zhao et al 2020 advancements in ct imaging techniques have enabled in situ non destructive extractions of 3d images of rock structures huaimin et al 2019 latief et al 2010 li et al 2019 nickerson et al 2019 for pore scale seepage simulation akhondzadeh et al 2020 chen et al 2015 jiang and tsuji 2017 liu et al 2009 okabe and blunt 2004 vianna et al 2020 which provides insights into the flow behavior in pore structures however these approaches are constrained by limited investigation volumes typically of the order of m m 3 trade off between resolution and field of view and simulation related computational challenges wang et al 2021 an alternative approach for studying the flow mechanism is to combine sem imaging blunt et al 2013 bultreys et al 2016 and fractal modeling dutta and tarafdar 2003 gao et al 2020 krohn and thompson 1986 liu et al 2018 shao et al 2017 which can access to the pore structure at a variety of scales bera et al 2011 klaver et al 2015 krohn and thompson 1986 li et al 2017 radlinski et al 2004 and are efficient in estimating rock permeability k davudov et al 2020 kelly et al 2014 klaver et al 2015 okabe and blunt 2004 song et al 2019 combined sem and fractal theory to describe the multiscale structures of shale pores while calculating their flow and transport properties yu et al 2019 incorporated fractal theory and capillary bundle models into a multi step interpretation framework of sem images to assess single phase fluid flow in pore structures subsequently dong et al 2020 introduced tortuosity into the fractal permeability model to improve its accuracy they showed that the model fails owing to a sharp increase in k caused by the existence of core scale fractures davudov et al 2020 reconstructed the 3d pore structure by stacking sem images to evaluate the interplay between k and pore connectivity ni et al 2021 analyzed the pore structure and k of sandstones based on fractal theory and sem images at different magnifications although previous studies demonstrated that k can be determined via 2d or 3d imaging of the pore structure of rock samples the influence of core scale fractures has not been adequately investigated berkowitz 2002 dai et al 2010 dietrich et al 2005 dong et al 2020 yu et al 2019 moreover the effect of scale differences between laboratory and field parameters is an important factor that should be considered when modeling fluid flow and mass transport in geological formations apourvari and arns 2016 ayirala et al 2020 dai et al 2005 2007 2008 2009 galvao et al 2016 soltanian et al 2015a 2018 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021b hassan et al 1997 and neuman 1990 established a large scale k based on deterministic concepts assuming homogeneity in geologic units when sufficient field survey data are available the fine scale information can be projected onto coarse scale blocks furthermore stochastic theory was developed to obtain the spatial probability distribution of field scale k based on the statistical characteristics of the smaller scale considering the heterogeneity of subsurface formations dagan et al 2013 li et al 2011 rubin and gómez hernández 1990 zhang et al 2021b however stochastic methods are not effective for subsurface media with large spatial covariances because geological measurements are required to capture statistical structures zhang et al 2021b thus li and xing 2016 used the k model with a random distribution to test three traditional mean methods and proposed a new statistical algorithm to determine the equivalent k of coal samples in addition solute transport parameters in porous media such as dispersivity diffusion and sorption coefficients have been up scaled in simulations involving geochemical and biological reactions chew and law 2020 dai et al 2007 dai et al 2009 giammar and hering 2001 klotz et al 1980 reimus and callahan 2007 rolle et al 2013 soltanian et al 2015b zech et al 2015 dai et al 2007 proved that the field scale diffusion coefficient d m could be determined via statistical analysis of laboratory scale in d m and increased with the integral scale they further derived scaling equations for upscaling sorption coefficients which was verified by monte carlo simulations dai et al 2009 evidently upscaling approaches have been widely used in diverse practical applications for modeling flow and transport behaviors at the field scale with a reasonable computational cost however their application to the mine water inflow prediction remains limited to address this gap this study develops an upscaling framework integrating multiscale void structures micropores and core fractures and fracture statistical parameters to obtain a field scale k for predicting water inflow from 2 coal roof sandstone aquifers in the xingdong mine north china the fractal characteristics of the pore structure are analyzed based on sem imaging of sandstone samples and the flow capacity of groundwater through the pore space is evaluated using a fractal permeability model the contribution of core scale fractures to fluid flow on larger scales is quantified by inversing the effective fracture aperture b x furthermore a formula that incorporates the statistical characteristics of pores and fractures is derived to upscale k from pore and core scales to the field scale this formula is verified based on the large diameter well method the effectiveness of the upscaling approach for the water inflow prediction is confirmed through comparison with previously observed data the findings of this study have important implications for the use of borehole cores to characterize the field spatial variability of the k of roof sandstone aquifers at an affordable cost 2 study site the xingdong coal mine is located to the east of xingtai city hebei province china fig 1 the surface of the mine area is completely covered by quaternary loose sediments the strata are as follows from older to newer ordovician carboniferous permian triassic tertiary and quaternary moreover the coal bearing strata in the mine are as follows from deep to shallow middle carboniferous benxi formation upper carboniferous taiyuan formation and lower permian shanxi formation the mean thickness of these strata is 217 13 m with 15 coal bearing seams numbered in order from top to bottom as 1 2 2down 3up 3 4down 5up 5 6 6down 7up 7 8 9 and 10 the shanxi formation which belongs to transitional clastic sedimentary strata has a rich variety of plant fossils and is one of the main coal bearing seams in the mine the 2 coal seam in the formation is the main mined coal seam owing to its stability mineability and abundance xiashihezi formation is the strata overlying 2 coal seam it is 64 m thick and comprises grey and greyish green mudstone and siltstone with greyish white fine sandstone moreover the sandstone in the formation is primarily composed of quartz and feldspar with muddy cementation and undeveloped primary fractures fig 2 three aquifer groups are identified in the mining area ordovician limestone carboniferous limestone and permian sandstone aquifer groups the direct water source that threatens the safety of 2 coal production is in the aquifers overlying the 2 coal seam including shanxi formation and xiashihezi formation sandstone aquifers both aquifers are dominated by mud cemented medium fine sandstones and belong to the permian sandstone aquifer group the average thickness of the shanxi formation sandstone aquifer is approximately 8 05 m and the groundwater stored in this thin aquifer could be drained quickly by contrast the average thickness of the xiashihezi formation aquifer is approximately 19 8 m and the groundwater in the aquifer continues to flow into the mine along the hydraulic fracture zone when mining 2 coal seam the primary fractures in the aquifer could grow in density and aperture because of stratigraphic disturbances resulting in an increase in the amount of roof water inflow although the xingdong mine has conducted an in depth investigation of the floor limestone aquifers and floor water inrush roof water inflow has not yet been sufficiently studied therefore we selected the xiashihezi formation sandstone aquifer as our target strata from which eight sandstone rocks were sampled and marked from txl01 to txl08 in sequence the sandstone rocks from the xiashihezi formation were selected from four different boreholes and also at different depths to ensure that the rock samples adequately represent for this study site although considering more borehole cores would help describe the aquifer more accurately we focused on roof water inflow at the early stages of 2 coal mining during which the number of suitable cores in the core library is relatively limited 3 methods 3 1 pore scale analyses eight sandstone samples were imaged using sem to estimate the k of the pore structure in the roof sandstone aquifer two thin sections were prepared for each sample and a total of 16 thin sections were obtained with length width and thickness of 1 cm 1 cm 1 mm respectively the samples were prepared before loading the thin sections to observe the pore structure as follows 1 soaking the samples in pure ethanol to remove organic impurities 2 using an air pump to remove inorganic impurities from sample surfaces 3 gold spraying of samples to enhance the conductivity of the sandstone surface for sem imaging subsequently 89 images were acquired using a field emission sem s 4800 hitachi japan and used in the statistical analysis of pore structure characteristics the processing of sem images was introduced in detail in our previous study dong et al 2020 and includes the following three main steps 1 removal of gaussian noise generated during image acquisition and transmission using a wiener adaptive filter 2 extraction of pores from the background by determining the appropriate threshold to segment the sem images and 3 acquisition of pore geometry parameters such as pore perimeter and area based on geometric statistical algorithms the pore geometry parameters and pore size distribution psd were determined in post processing steps subsequently fractal theory was employed for describing the pore structure of the sample owing to its ability to characterize complex systems karimpouli and tahmasebi 2019 cai et al 2015 xia et al 2018 the fractal system exhibits approximate self similarity i e the pore perimeter s is proportional to the d 2 power of the pore area a at different scales as expressed in the following equation yu et al 2019 1 s δ a 0 δ 1 d 1 a δ d 2 c 0 a δ d 2 where a 0 is a constant related to the rock pore structure δ is the measurement scale of pore perimeters and areas c 0 is the fractal coefficient expressed as c 0 a 0 δ 1 d 1 and d is the fractal dimension which reflects the complexity of the pore structure the pore space consists of a series of curved capillaries jiang et al 2017 watanabe and flury 2008 and is assumed as capillary bundles in which groundwater flows and transports fig 3 the hagen poiseuille equation is used to describe the steady flow of an incompressible viscous fluid in a horizontal circular tube zhang et al 2021a combining it with darcy s law a fractal model of the following form was introduced to estimate k dong et al 2020 2 k 2 π m 4 i 1 n a i 4 2 d τ a where k is the permeability which represents the resistance of porous media and is independent of fluid properties m is expressed as m 1 c 0 where c 0 is the fractal coefficient τ is the geometric tortuosity related to the porosity of the porous media a i denotes the area of i th pore a denotes the total cross sectional area and n represents the number of capillary bundles in a groundwater flow in the pore space is subject to the directional resistance of solid particles and relative resistance of fluid flow reagan et al 2015 berre et al 2019 hou et al 2021 this implies that k depends not only on the intrinsic properties of the porous media but also on the fluid properties as expressed by the following equation 3 k ρ g μ k where ρ is the fluid density g is the gravitational acceleration k is the intrinsic permeability and μ is the dynamic viscosity combining eqs 2 and 3 yields 4 k p 2 π ρ g m 4 i 1 n a i 4 2 d μ τ a where k p is the hydraulic conductivity of the pore structure and is related to the geometric and fractal characteristics of the pore structure and the fluid properties 3 2 core scale experiments in a fractured porous medium fpm k values depend on the structural characteristics of pores and fractures such as pore size distribution pore connectivity fracture aperture fracture density and dip angles adler et al 2013 karimpouli and tahmasebi 2019 in particular the fracture aperture is a key parameter in controlling fluid flow and transport in such aquifers however direct measurements of the fracture aperture at the core scale remains challenging berkowitz 2002 wang et al 2015 core scale experiments can help determine the contribution of fractures to the overall flow characteristics of rock samples adler et al 2013 singhal and gupta 2010 in this study k and were measured for following three purposes 1 assessing the capacity of the fluid flow in the pore structure 2 verifying the fractal k model by the data measured at the core scale and 3 quantifying the contribution of fractures to k by combining the fractal model of the pore structure gas is typically used for fast rock k measurements dietrich et al 2005 singhal and gupta 2010 in this study helium was chosen as the test fluid and and k were measured by an overburden porosity permeability meter ap 608 fig 4 specifically boyle s law was used to obtain the void volume of the sample moreover k was determined based on the gas pulse attenuation theory the gas slippage effect was also considered meng et al 2021 in addition an unsteady measurement technology was applied to ensure stable pressure attenuation in the measured sample 3 3 upscaling for hydraulic conductivity the conceptual models describing fpm mainly include the equivalent porous media model and the discrete fracture network model the latter is limited by the large amount of required data which are difficult to acquire adler et al 2013 berkowitz 2002 when the representative elementary volume rev of the fpm is large enough to maintain the stability of averaged geophysical properties the dual medium of pores and fractures can be homogenized into an equivalent porous media enabling an upscaling process from experimental analysis to field application singhal and gupta 2010 faybishenko et al 2015 reagan et al 2015 to scale up k the hydraulic conductivity of the pore and fracture structure should be considered additionally the mass conservation equation of the total volume discharge q through the rev of fpm should be established the k p has been introduced in section 3 1 next the flow of fluids in the fracture and the expression for the hydraulic conductivity of a single fracture are introduced as shown in fig 5 a natural fracture consists of rough surfaces on both sides of the rock with a non constant aperture faybishenko et al 2015 for multiphase flow variations in fracture aperture result in an uneven distribution of entry pressure which significantly affects seepage simulations dietrich et al 2005 singhal and gupta 2010 only one fluid phase i e the liquid phase was considered in this study the natural fracture can be simplified as two plane parallel plates with a constant aperture throughout the entire fracture fig 5 in the parallel plate model the hydraulic walls of the fracture are assumed to be smooth and the fluid flow between the two parallel plates is assumed to be laminar using darcy s law k of the parallel plate model is expressed as follows 5 k f ρ g 12 μ b 2 where k f represents the hydraulic conductivity of the fracture and b is the distance between two plates that represents the fracture aperture considering the combined effect of pores and fractures the upscaling formula of the k can be established based on the law of conservation of mass fig 6 a shows the rev of the fpm whose length width and thickness are represented by l x l y and m respectively the rev comprises pores matrix and n fractures with different apertures ranging from b x 01 to b x 0 n line fracture rate d x refers to the proportion of fractures per unit length in the direction perpendicular to the fracture strike in the rev d x can be expressed as the ratio of the sum of fracture apertures to the width of the rev to upscale k the dual medium of pores and fractures can be generalized as an equivalent porous medium fig 6b this simplified concept is justified by the fact that the water inflow prediction only focuses on the total volume discharge q and the final loss of hydraulic head and not on the distribution of hydraulic head flow direction and velocity at any time berkowitz 2002 subsequently assuming that the equivalent porous medium is homogeneous and isotropic the flux balance equation is obtained as follows 6 q 0 d x l y k f d h x d l x m d y 0 l y d x l y k p d h x d l x m d y 0 l y k d h x d l x m d y where k f is the hydraulic conductivity of the fractured medium k p is the hydraulic conductivity of the pore medium k is the equivalent hydraulic conductivity and d h x d l x denotes the hydraulic gradient in the l x direction this equation can also be expressed as 7 k f d h x d l x b x m k p d h x d l x l y b x m k d h x d l x l y m where k f is the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of the fractured medium k p is the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of the pore medium and b x denotes the effective aperture of fractures in the rev of fpm the first term on the left side represents the water flux through the fractured medium which is expressed as 8 k f d h x d l x b x m i 1 n k fi b 0 i d h x d l x m 0 d x l y k f b x d y d h x d l x m taking the natural logarithms of b x and supposing b y ln b x we obtain 9 k f d h x d l x b x m 0 d x l y k f b x d y d h x d l x m 0 d x l y k f e b y d y d h x d l x m making the use of eq 5 and b x e b y yields 10 k f d h x d l x b x m 0 d x l y k f e b y d y d h x d l x m ρ g 12 μ 0 d x l y e 3 b y d y d h x d l x m according to the perturbation formulation gelhar and axness 1983 b y can be expressed in terms of the mean b y and perturbation b y and eq 10 becomes 11 k f d h x d l x b x m ρ g 12 μ 0 d x l y e 3 b y d y d h x d l x m ρ g 12 μ 0 d x l y e 3 b y b y d y d h x d l x m where e b y 0 and b y is the mean aperture of fractures in the rev considering b y ln b x we know b y ln b x and it is also a constant substituting and integrating the term of e 3 b y produce the following expression 12 k f d h x d l x b x m ρ g 12 μ b x 3 0 d x l y e 3 b y d y d h x d l x m taylor expansion of the e 3 b y term yields 13 k f d h x d l x b x m ρ g 12 μ b x 3 0 d x l y 1 3 b y 3 b y 2 2 3 b y 3 3 d y d h x d l x m subsequently by integrating the first three terms of eq 13 the eq 13 can be approximated as 14 k f d h x d l x b x m ρ g 12 μ b x 3 d x l y 1 9 2 σ b y 2 d h x d l x m where d x denotes the line fracture rate and σ b y 2 represents the variance of the natural logarithmic aperture of the fracture by replacing k p in eq 7 with eq 4 the water flux through the pore medium can be expressed as 15 k p d h x d l x l y b x m 2 π ρ g m 4 i 1 n a i 4 2 d μ τ a d h x d l x l y b x m considering b x l y the k of fpm is approximately expressed as 16 k ρ g 12 μ l y b x 3 d x l y 1 9 2 σ b y 2 2 π ρ g m 4 i 1 n a i 4 2 d μ τ a considering eq 5 eq 14 can be expressed as 17 ρ g 12 μ b x 3 d h x d l x m ρ g 12 μ b x 3 d x l y 1 9 2 σ b y 2 d h x d l x m therefore the expression of b x in the fractured medium is 18 b x b x d x l y 1 9 2 σ b y 2 1 3 from eq 16 k can be determined via pore structure analysis and fracture characteristics statistics in the early stage of 2 coal mining the primary fractures of the roof aquifer in xingdong mine are not well developed liu 2006 and b x cannot be determined by eq 18 as it is too small to be measured accurately we combined eqs 5 and 7 and developed a multistep model for inverting b x which is expressed as follows 19 b x 12 μ k k p l y ρ g 1 3 to determine b x we prepared cylindrical samples of approximately 2 5 cm in diameter and height for core scale experiments which were imaged via sem in eq 19 k was obtained via pneumatic experiments using rock samples with fractures k p was determined from a model based interpretation of sem images and l y representing the sample diameter was approximately 2 5 cm when b x is known eq 16 can be simplified as follows 20 k ρ g 12 μ l y b x 3 2 π ρ g m 4 i 1 n a i 4 2 d μ τ a k f d x k p where d x is the line fracture rate which can be determined based on fracture statistics using field data in eq 20 three different scale methods are required to determine k namely pore scale analysis core scale experiments and field statistics 3 4 large diameter well method for water inflow prediction the k value obtained from the upscaling framework was used to predict the mine water inflow of 2 coal roof sandstone aquifer in xingdong mine various methods exist for predicting mine water inflow such as analytical numerical water balance and artificial neural networks guo et al 2009 li et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 the large diameter well method is an analytical method that is developed from dupuit formulas and has been widely used in predicting mine water inflow owing to its high speed strong adaptability and high precision li et al 2014 hou 2013 groundwater is considered to flow into a large well at the center of mines a detailed description of the large well method is included in appendix a from which we know the large well formulas of confined unconfined steady flow under orthogonal water supply condition

large well to the supply boundary respectively a and b are the length and width of the rectangular tunnel respectively and the value of coefficient η depends on the value of a b shown in table a 3 4 results and discussions 4 1 pore structure characteristics we evaluated the cumulative percentage of psd for the eight sandstone samples using sem image analysis as shown in fig 7 the number of pores decreases with the increasing pore size in addition more than 88 of pore radius values were less than 100 nm indicating that the psd was relatively dispersed and the pore structure was not well developed the txl06 sample had the lowest cumulative psd percentage below 50 nm at approximately 46 whereas the txl08 sample had the largest cumulative psd percentage of approximately 76 5 in particular for the txl07 sample all pore sizes were distributed below 200 nm with 76 of the pore sizes below 50 nm the degree of the pore structure development in the roof sandstone aquifer of the xingdong mine was estimated based on statistical analysis of the psd of the samples furthermore we employed fractal geometry to quantitatively evaluate the pore structure of the eight samples we first determined the area and perimeter of all pores using image processing techniques subsequently the power function was used to fit the data of the pore areas and perimeters fig 8 giving the fractal dimension d and fractal coefficient c 0 of the pore structure of the samples using eq 1 table 1 substituting the fractal parameters d and c 0 into eq 2 we obtained theoretical k values of the pore structure of sandstone samples table 1 as is evident from the results in table 1 the mean coefficient of determination r 2 is greater than 0 90 and the fractal dimension values d are in the range of 1 0 1 3 high r 2 indicated that a strong correlation between the pore areas and perimeters and strong fractal characteristics of the samples pore structure the fractal dimension d is an important indicator of the effectiveness of the space occupied by complex objects the larger its value the more complicated the fractal system in table 1 the mean d value is 1 15 suggesting that the pore structure of the samples in the 2 coal roof sandstone aquifer of xingdong coal mine is poorly developed which is consistent with the measured results of pneumatic experiments the smallest d value was observed in the txl07 sample 1 07 and the largest value was in txl02 sample 1 21 since the eight samples all came from the 2 coal roof sandstone aquifer they do not differ significantly in d values and have similar fractal properties meanwhile the theoretical k values obtained by the pore scale analysis were in the range of 0 37 3 75 10 2 m d with a mean value of 2 00 10 2 m d the txl07 sample had the lowest theoretical k value of 0 37 10 2 m d whereas the txl03 sample had the highest value of 3 75 10 2 m d as is evident from fig 7 the pore sizes of the txl07 sample were below than 200 nm and mostly less than 50 nm therefore the txl07 sample exhibited the lowest k and d value large pores control the flow of fluids in porous media the txl03 sample had the highest percentage of pores in the 200 310 nm interval resulting in the largest theoretical k value thus with similar fractal characteristics the distribution of large pore sizes is a key factor influencing groundwater flow in porous media in this study the pore scale analysis of the samples is the minimum scale to characterize the permeability of underground formations in the mine area 4 2 permeability measured at core scale following the analysis of the pore structure larger scale pneumatic experiments were performed to examine flow properties of the 2 coal roof sandstone aquifer the results showed that the measured values were less than 9 and the samples have a poorly developed pore structure this conclusion was consistent with the findings of the aforementioned fractal analysis using the sem images furthermore the measured k values ranged from 0 40 to 2926 50 10 2 m d with the k values of the txl03 and txl05 samples being three orders magnitude higher than those of the other six sandstone samples the fractures in the txl03 and txl05 samples were found via observations dong et al 2020 the high k values resulted from the joint action of pores and fractures at different scales the results in table 2 show that the txl03 sample had the second smallest value and the largest k value suggesting that the fracture causes a sharp increase in k values and plays an important role in fluid flow in the fpm the effect of core scale fractures must be considered in the prediction of mine water inflow for the samples without fractures k values exhibited a good correlation with the values listed in table 2 moreover the psd also affects k values for example the txl08 sample does not have the largest value but has the largest k value because it has the highest percentage of pores larger than 250 nm the k values were determined based on the pore structure and the measured data obtained by the core scale pneumatic experiments was used to verify the fractal k prediction model the fractal k model was evaluated using measured data table 3 results showed that the model errors are in the range of 3 33 11 52 with a mean error less than 10 when quantifying the contribution of fractures to k the effect of the pore structure due to the coexistence of pores and fractures in the rock samples should be eliminated as is evident from the results in table 3 the accuracy of the fractal k model was sufficient to remove the effect of pore structure and thus effectively invert the contribution of fractures to fluid flow in the fpm notably all predicted k values were smaller than the measured values in eq 2 the k value was negatively correlated to the tortuosity τ low values of imply high values of τ which is why all predicted k values were lower than the measured values in predicting the k values of the pore structure sufficient pores captured via sem are required to accurately characterize the size distribution and fractal properties despite the advantages of sem in terms of field of view it fails to map the spatial connectivity of the pore structure thus future research should focus on the flow behavior and properties of fluids in 3d structures to understand the origins of the prediction errors 4 3 determination of hydraulic conductivity before predicting water inflow the k of roof sandstone aquifer should be determined based on pore scale analysis core scale pneumatic experiments and field statistics of fracture characteristics liquid density ρ and dynamic viscosity coefficient μ vary with temperature based on the assumption of the groundwater temperature of 20 c all measured k values were converted to k values using eq 3 averaging k p of the six samples we determined the k p of the roof aquifer as 1 32 10 5 m d for txl03 and txl05 samples the measured k values were essentially converted to k values rather than k f or k p values because of the coexistence of pores and fractures in them to determine k f b x values must be known and the b x values of these samples were too small at the microscale to be directly measured using conventional instruments therefore we inverted the b x of txl03 and txl05 samples by substituting three parameters of k k p and l y into eq 18 in which k p was determined based on the fractal k model results are shown in table 4 and the mean b x value of two samples is 18 9 μ m substituting it into eq 5 k f was determined as 25 2 m d in addition through field investigations and literature review we determined that the fractures in the 2 coal roof sandstone aquifer were not well developed the d x ranged from 0 01 to 0 1 in the early stage of 2 coal mining du 2006 the k p k f and d x of the roof aquifer had been determined using pore scale analysis core scale pneumatic experiments and field scale investigations respectively substituting them into eq 20 we obtained the k values which ranged from 0 25 to 2 52 10 2 m d as listed in table 5 when k p and k f are determined k grows linearly with d x and thus d x is the key parameter that determines the k value of the roof aquifer as the coal is mined d x could increase because of the generation of tiny fractures that is caused by disturbances and stress changes in the formations overlying coal seams given that b x remains constant statistics of d x in underground coal mines are crucial for tracking the amount of roof water inflow during the mining process if b x grows and is easily measured b x should be determined by the statistical fracture characteristics such as b x and σ b y 2 instead of inverting using eq 19 here the b x value was inversed by laboratory experiments of sandstone samples due to the undeveloped fractures in the roof sandstone aquifer 4 4 prediction of mine water inflow after the k value was determined we calculated the mine water inflow using the large well formula the hydrogeological conceptual model of the xingdong coal mine was established based on the geological survey report liu 2006 as shown in fig 1 the xingdong coal mine is located between the f19 and f 23 faults the 750 m working face in the no 1 mining area of the 2 coal was selected for the water inflow prediction the f2 fault in the east and the f 23 fault in the south were considered as infinite boundaries because both were not entirely cut off from the 2 coal roof sandstone aquifer the f1 fault was hydraulically connected to the ordovician limestone aquifer which can be generalized as the water supply boundary moreover the f19 fault is bordered by the ordovician limestone aquifer which can be considered as the water conduction boundary owing to the existence of water conducting fractured zone after the drainage of 2 coal roof aquifer the central aquifer of the mining area changed from confined water to unconfined water whereas the confined water far from the center of the mining area remained unchanged the aquifer was essentially a confined unconfined aquifer therefore eq 21 was used to predict mine roof water inflow based on the aforementioned hydrogeological conceptual model the k in eq 21 was taken as the k value of the 2 coal roof sandstone aquifer other parameters in eq 21 were all obtained from a geological survey report of the xingdong coal mine du 2006 the value of each parameter and the predicted results of roof water inflow are listed in table 6 the results showed that the predicted value of the roof water inflow was between 9 32 m3 h and 92 78 m3 h when d x ranged from 0 01 to 0 1 the actual water inflow 21 m3 h at the primary stage of mining 2 coal was between 18 59 m3 h and 27 87 m3 h which falls within the predicted range of 9 32 92 78 m3 h and its corresponding d x was in the range of 0 02 0 03 fig 9 these results indicate that the proposed upscaling framework is valid and effective for predicting the mine water inflow of 2 coal roof sandstone aquifer in xingdong mine mining of coal seams results in an increase in the amount of roof water inflow with increasing d x when assessing the safety of coal production we should focus on the spreading of fractures in the overlying aquifers of coal seams for preventing the surge of mine water inflow from roof aquifers notably the growth of the fracture aperture b x could lead to a significant increase in the roof water inflow the generation and development of fractures provide flow channels for groundwater which is the underlying reason for water inflow incidents in mining production although the pore structure of roof aquifers has a limited role in the rapid inflow of roof water into the mine it is the storage space for groundwater and determines the total volume of water inflow in the absence of recharge the interaction between pores and fractures should be investigated to prevent water inflow incidents during coal mining 5 summary and conclusions in this study an upscaling framework was developed to integrate the multiscale hydrogeological properties of roof aquifers in the coal mine including microscopic pores core scale fracture geometry and field scale fracture distributions for predicting water inflow from roof sandstone aquifers to mines the 2 coal roof sandstone aquifer in the xingdong coal mine was selected as a representative example to verify the upscaling framework the key conclusions are summarized as follows 1 pore scale analysis results showed that the pore structure of the samples exhibits fractal characteristics and the low fractal dimension d revealed the poorly developed pore structure in the roof sandstone aquifer of xingdong mine 2 core scale experiments results indicated that the fractures existed in the samples resulting in a sharp increase in k values moreover the k model was verified and the accuracy was sufficient to invert the effective aperture b x 3 b x was the crucial parameter for upscaling k in the fractured formations the growth of b x could result in a significant inrush of groundwater threatening the safety of workers in coal mining we can determine the b x value by the statistical fracture characteristics in combination with eq 18 or by the multistep inversion model of eq 19 4 when the line fracture rate d x was distributed between 0 01 and 0 1 the corresponding roof water inflow ranged from 9 32 m 3 h to 92 78 m 3 h coal mining triggers fractures leading to increased d x when b x is constant the statistics of d x is essential to keep track of the amount of roof water inflow accurate characterization of the multi scale fracture properties is key to the effective prediction of mine water inflow from the fractured porous aquifers for the coal mine considered in our study more field investigations of outcrops in the target strata and geophysical explorations of underground aquifer features will help us understand the field scale hydrogeological properties of the roof aquifers moreover laboratory analyses regional geophysical surveys and field pumping tests should be combined to reduce the uncertainty in field scale aquifer parameters and ensure the accuracy of water inflow prediction in the mining area credit authorship contribution statement lulu xu conceptualization methodology

3049,one of the most important factors concerning the design of earth fill dams is the accurate seepage estimation which is highly correlated to the permeability and hydraulic conductivity of the core material with the geographic coordinates of 37 31 35 9 north and 46 07 55 6 east gale chay dam is located in the northwest of iran in east azerbaijan province the dam is highly important regarding the provided economic benefits for the region in this research the steady state seepage analysis of the gale chay dam was conducted via the finite element model fem using a novel saturated fractal hydraulic conductivity model and the results were compared with those obtained from the conventional and fractal models in the unsaturated condition for estimating the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the core material the fractal theory was employed using the image processing technique the scanning electron microscope sem images and a new fractal permeability model the estimated saturated hydraulic conductivities were in good accordance with the measured values furthermore since the fractal theory considers the distribution of the pores the estimated upper and lower bounds of the saturated hydraulic conductivity resulted in better seepage estimations using the estimated maximum minimum and average fractal hydraulic conductivities the results of the saturated seepage analysis indicated relative errors of 15 6 8 and 10 8 compared to the observed seepage the results were acceptable in terms of safety and economic aspects conducting the unsaturated seepage analysis it was observed that the estimated seepage was highly influenced by the saturated hydraulic conductivity value hence the estimated average fractal hydraulic conductivity by the image processing technique affected the unsaturated fractal and conventional models in a way that the unsaturated seepage analysis was improved by an average of 80 moreover the unsaturated fractal model revealed reliable estimations compared to the conventional models and was considered a feasible alternative for estimating the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity keywords seepage analysis hydraulic conductivity finite element model fem scanning electron microscope sem fractal dimension gale chay dam data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hydraulic conductivity is critical in the accurate description of the water flow in a porous environment zhang and schaap 2019 several laboratory experiments are usually performed to measure the hydraulic conductivity of a soil specimen however since the experiments are long lasting and laborious several functions have been developed to estimate hydraulic conductivity more readily dai et al 2013 zhai and rahardjo 2015 it has been indicated that hydraulic conductivity is directly related to the permeability of the soil which is an intrinsic parameter associated with the microstructure of the soil texture grant 2005 zhai et al 2018 therefore to gain a more accurate estimation of hydraulic conductivity it is indispensable to study the porous soil structure precisely accordingly it was declared that porous media could be defined as a fractal object of nature xu 2015 fractals are a novel type of geometry introduced by mandelbrot 1982 whose main intention was to study the irregular or fragmented forms that euclidian geometry considers amorphous it was noted that the complexity of a porous structure i e pore or particle size distribution could be identified by the concept of fractal dimension zarnaghi et al 2018 the fractal dimension of a porous medium has been derived from a variety of approaches including the image processing of the sem images dong et al 2020 zou et al 2020 dou et al 2021 and the mercury intrusion porosimetry mip test zarnaghi et al 2018 song et al 2019 ding et al 2020 based on fractal theory several permeability models both saturated and unsaturated have already been developed for porous media for instance a fractal permeability model for bi dispersed porous media was proposed by yu and cheng 2002 which was related to the pore area fractal dimension and it was observed that the predicted fractal permeabilities are in good agreement with the measured data xu and sun 2002 derived an expression for the relative hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated porous media based on fractal dimension in this study the mip method was used to obtain the fractal dimension of mass volume furthermore the study revealed that the fractal dimension of a porous media could be driven by fitting the fractal soil water characteristic curve swcc function to the available swcc data points if the mip method is not accessible based on the fractal nature of the porous environment yu and liu 2004 established a fractal permeability model for both saturated and unsaturated conditions without any empirical parameters the proposed models indicated good agreement with the existing measurements regarding porosity maximum pore size and fractal dimension xu and yu 2008 proposed an analytical expression for the permeability of the porous media subsequently the kc constant was expressed based on the fractal geometry in a review article yu 2008 showed that fractal geometry and techniques are capable of flow analysis and the description of transport properties in a porous environment a fractal permeability model for fractured rocks was developed based on fractal geometry theory it was observed that the proposed expression is related to the fractal dimension of the fractured area the mentioned model was verified by comparing the numerical simulations and the model predictions miao et al 2015 presenting analytical derivations and considering the particle and pore surface areas equal and constant the defining parameters of swcc were related to particle and pore geometry information in this way the fractal dimension of particle size distribution was employed and it was pointed out that an swcc for a single void ratio could also be applied to void ratios of any other sort using just the particle size distribution russell 2014 using fractal dimensions for pore and grain size distribution khoshghalb et al 2015 proposed a fractal swcc model based on soil volume change effects considering no particle crushing the fractal dimension of particle size distribution was assumed to be constant and the same pore size distribution was noted to be dependent on the void ratio the results indicated good agreement with the experimental data a fractal based hydraulic conductivity model was developed by yang et al 2014 using swcc data having hydraulic hysteresis accordingly the pore geometry was considered a fractal pattern and a direct relationship between the microstructure of soils and hydraulic parameters was observed also the results obtained from this research were in good agreement with the measurements soto et al 2017 investigated the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of pore structure from the fractal point of view the results highlighted that the proposed models agreed well with the observed data furthermore it was declared that in the absence of laboratory experiments the fractal based model could be a reliable alternative for predicting soil hydraulic properties a simple constitutive model was proposed by soldi et al 2017 in which the hysteresis phenomenon was expressed to describe the unsaturated flow and the performance of the model was tested and verified with the experimental data tao et al 2019 derived the unified fractal model for unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of soils based on the fractal form of swcc in which only two parameters named fractal dimension and air entry value were included in the model accordingly the proposed model could efficiently estimate the hydraulic conductivity of different soil types a permeability model has been established for the porous environment based on soil properties such as porosity grain size and pore size the model was approvingly compared with the existing permeability models and experimental data jougnot et al 2021 the majority of the aforementioned permeability and hydraulic conductivity models utilize the conventional assumption of λ min λ max d 10 2 where λmin and λmax are the minimum and maximum pore diameters however the actual porous media entails a wide variety of pores containing large and small ones with this regard an improved model for permeability of the porous media was presented by shen et al 2018 where a novel probability density function was defined with no restriction in terms of pore radii which expanded the applicability of the fractal theory for permeability estimation in several studies it is emphasized to use the fractal permeability and hydraulic conductivity functions in engineering practices such as seepage analysis of a porous media zhai et al 2021 however the existing fractal functions in the literature seem to be scarcely employed for this issue also the hydraulic conductivity coefficient is of immense importance with a wide range of divergence where this variation can act as a hurdle in seepage analysis through a porous environment the upper and lower bonds of permeability are usually determined and utilized in seepage analysis fredlund et al 1994 therefore it is imperative to gain a more precise estimation of permeability so that the seepage analysis becomes exact as well earth fill dams are among the most widely constructed civil engineering projects to store and transfer water according to several studies this type of dam is highly susceptible to internal erosion or piping phenomenon nourani et al 2012 fell et al 2014 hence it is crucial to ensure that the accurate estimation of seepage is considered in the designing of an earth fill dam to achieve such accuracy it is vital to make precise estimations of the dam materials hydraulic conductivities especially the clay material used in the dam core as it plays a critical role in water flow prevention different approaches have been utilized to investigate the seepage of an earth fill dam these methods mainly entail fem artificial neural networks anns and physical models nourani et al 2012 al janabi et al 2020 as a result of the existing uncertainties in permeability and hydraulic conductivity estimations consulting engineers and scholars often provide an upper and lower limit for the mentioned parameters this in itself leads to a prediction interval in seepage analysis hence providing a better estimation of hydraulic conductivity can have a significant impact on the seepage analysis and design of a dam considering the mentioned studies in permeability and hydraulic conductivity and the technical literature review it is clear that the fractal hydraulic conductivity models for both saturated and unsaturated soils could be employed as viable alternatives to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of a soil sample with desirable accuracies furthermore to the best of our knowledge it seems there is not any study regarding the implication of fractal hydraulic conductivity in seepage modeling and estimation of the earth fill dams the application of the fractal hydraulic conductivity model can be highly effective in the accurate seepage analysis as it not only considers the porosity of the porous media but also considers the distribution of such pores within the soil structure this study aimed to model and estimate seepage through gale chay earth fill dam using fem in both saturated and unsaturated conditions in this way the fractal and conventional hydraulic conductivity models were employed on sem images of gathered clay material to examine the merits of fractal theory in the accuracy of the seepage estimation 2 case study dam considering the availability of the data gale chay dam was chosen for the seepage analysis in the current study the dam is located on the gale chay river in ajabshir county east azerbaijan iran it is a zoned earth fill dam with a clay core built on an alluvial foundation and the body consists of shell transition and drain materials see fig 1 the annual discharge of the river at the dam site in the maximum water level with a reservoir area of 250 square kilometers is equivalent to 76 million cubic meters the dam was constructed for various purposes such as irrigation fish farming and hydropower generation and it contributes a significant role to the economic aspects of the region therefore it is of prime importance to evaluate the accurate amount of seepage through the dam body for monitoring the safety issues several piezometers have been placed at the four cross sections of the dam two of which are on both sides of the dam and the other two are at the middle part of the valley with maximum area section fig 2 indicates section no 2 of the gale chay dam as can be seen in fig 2 three lines of piezometer were placed in cross section no 2 the first line which is placed at a short distance from the bedrock consists of four piezometers numbers 207 211 the second line of the piezometers is placed in the middle of the cross section and contains three piezometers and the third line is comprised of three piezometers as well water levels in the piezometers have been monitored by east azerbaijan regional water department fig 2 depicts the piezometers positions and the different parts of the dam each of these parts has a specific hydraulic conductivity table 1 illustrates the saturated hydraulic conductivity of different dam parts measured by the laboratory experiments based on the gathered samples in situ and laboratory experiments have been conducted to estimate the saturated hydraulic conductivities of various materials indicated in table 1 for shell toe drain and transition materials the constant head laboratory experiments were conducted and for the core material the falling head experiment was carried out also the lugeon test was conducted on ten boreholes of 525 m to indicate the permeability and hydraulic conductivity of the upper and lower foundations the mentioned experiments were carried out by east azerbaijan regional water department and the data were acquired from the same organization the prominent material preventing the seepage is the dam core material as can be seen from table 1 the hydraulic conductivity of the core material is in a range where the lower minimum and upper maximum bounds are 1 10 8 and 1 2 10 7 m sec respectively also the observed average seepage amount of the dam has been measured using thin plate weirs and reported by east azerbaijan regional water department to be 2 5 10 5 m3 sec m at the maximum water level in the current study the seepage analysis of the gale chay dam was conducted in saturated and unsaturated conditions for the dam core material in this way the fractal theory was employed to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of the gathered samples fig 3 shows the schematic diagram of the proposed methodology which consists of several phases in three major steps within the modeling framework at the first step the permeability and the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the core material are estimated using the gathered samples fractal permeability model and image processing technique in the second step the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the core material is estimated via grain size distribution gsd data and both conventional and fractal models the third step is the seepage analysis and estimation by the fem and the previously estimated saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity values a detailed explanation of the proposed methodology is presented in the following sub sections 2 1 sample preparation and image processing sem images are often utilized to assess the microstructure of the porous medium preparing the specimen for sem analysis is a vital step that majorly includes two imperative phases eliminating the fluid occupying the pores and generating a flat monitoring surface for achieving the mentioned purposes in this study the freeze cut drying method was implemented on the clay soil samples the traditional methods of air drying and oven drying especially for the soils with high water content result in severe shrinkage of the sample thus the specimen will undergo significant microstructural changes the freeze cut drying method however reduces the shrinkage of the soil sample significantly shi et al 1999 the freeze cut drying process involves a freezing step at first in which the specimen is entirely soaked in liquid nitrogen immediately which causes the rapid freezing of the water in the pores the quick freezing of the water in the voids prevents the formation of crystal ice in the pores which gives a non disturbed microstructure of the soil specimen to gain a smooth surface which entails various microstructural levels of the pores the samples were diced with a sharp cutter subsequently the drying step was carried out in a freeze dryer for 48 h yuan et al 2019 in order to identify the pore size distribution using the fractal theory sem images were analyzed in the current study the image processing procedure of the study was carried out regarding the developed method of rabbani and salehi 2017 the darker spots in the sem images represent the voids for fluid transport the otsu multi level thresholding technique was employed to separate the darkest parts of the sem images such that the lowest standard deviation of intensity in each segment could be driven otsu 1979 then the watershed algorithm was used to separate the porous space which can precisely detect and segment the overlaying porous patterns the city block method was then applied as the distance transform in watershed segmentation coupled with the noise reduction method of median filtering the procedure for detecting the pore size distribution of the generated sem images is presented in fig 3 a within step 1 of the methodology the procedure yields the area of pores a the diameter of the pores r and the number of the pores n all of which are necessary to estimate the fractal based saturated hydraulic conductivity 2 2 fractal permeability model mandelbrot 1982 defined the fractal theory to describe the self similarity of natural objects and irregular patterns considering the complicated structure of porous media the previously developed geometric models could not accurately estimate the permeability of the porous medium however the development of the fractal theory led to significant improvements in permeability related research shen et al 2018 furthermore the application of the fractal models provides the investigation of the distribution of the voids in a porous sample hence it will be possible to obtain different distributions of pores with similar porosity for a soil structure one of the broadly used assumptions for developing the porosity model of a porous medium is the sierpinski carpet pattern liu et al 2021 to generate the sierpinski carpet the main square with the length of l is divided into nine even squares and the middle one is eliminated then the same process is implemented for the remaining squares assuming the pore filling method which utilizes the eliminated squares of the sierpinski carpet as the voids of the porous structure the pore area can be defined as shen et al 2018 1 a r a f 1 r l 2 d where a f l 2 defines the area of the field and r is the pore diameter in the microscopic scale hagen poiseuille equation for the flow rate in a single tube was utilized to formulate the total flow of the media subsequently using darcy s law shen et al 2018 developed a permeability model for fractal porous media as 2 k π 128 l 0 1 d t a f 2 d 3 d t d 3 r max 3 d t 1 r min r max 3 d t d 1 r min r max 3 where l 0 is the side length of the square field of view and a f indicates the area of the field of view the maximum and minimum pore diameters are defined by r max and r min respectively also d t shows the tortuosity fractal dimension in two dimensional space it has been observed that the saturated hydraulic conductivity is related to the fluid density and viscosity as well as the structure of the porous media as grant 2005 3 k s k ρ g η where η and ρ are the viscosity and the density of the fluid g is the gravitational constant and k specifies the intrinsic permeability of the porous media which can be estimated using fractal theory by eq 2 the flow channels in the porous materials are considered to be composed of a bundle of tortuous capillary tubes in which the tortuosity fractal dimension of the media can be defined as 4 d t 1 ln τ av ln l r av 5 τ av 1 2 1 1 φ 2 1 1 φ 2 1 φ 4 1 1 φ where τ av is average tortuosity r av indicates the average pore diameter φ is the porosity and f r is the probability density function also the porosity fractal model is defined as shen et al 2018 6 φ φ r min 1 1 a r max a f r r max 2 d furthermore according to the unrestricted probability density function derived by shen et al 2018 the average pore diameter i e eq 9 can also be considered as 7 r av d r min d 1 1 r min r max d 1 fig 3 b depicts the second step required for estimating the saturated hydraulic conductivity from the image processing of the soil specimens based on fractal theory via the mentioned formulas considering fig 3 the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is calculated after the saturated hydraulic conductivity estimation which entails swcc and relative hydraulic conductivity estimation the details of formulas and the employed procedure have been explained in appendices a and b 2 3 governing equation for seepage estimation the classical richards equation was assumed to be the governing equation for water transport in the porous media for the saturated and unsaturated conditions townsend et al 2015 the governing differential equation for the isotropic case in the steady state condition can be written as fredlund 2006 8 x k u h x y k u h y q 0 where h is the water head t is the time θ declares the volumetric water content and k u specifies the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity which can be defined as k u k r k s in which k s and k r are the saturated and relative hydraulic conductivity respectively considering the water flow occurring through the saturated zone the relative hydraulic conductivity equals one fu and sheng 2009 a set of proper boundary conditions must be specified as either a hydraulic head or a flow rate on the boundary nodal points to solve eq 8 fu and sheng 2009 the defined hydraulic heads at the boundary nodes are called the dirichlet boundary conditions also the specified flow rates across the boundary are called neumann boundary conditions fredlund 2006 the fem is one of the appropriate numerical methods to discretize and solve eq 8 on the spatial domain which is widely utilized for two dimensional problems in the current study as the steady state seepage analysis was considered to be conducted the galerkin solution of the weighted residuals method was employed to solve eq 8 the finite element equation for two dimensional steady state seepage can be reviewed in fredlund 2006 to accomplish the aims of this study the geo studio package was utilized for numerical simulation seep w is integrated into geo studio allowing it to build and analyze models using geo studio tools in seep w fem is employed to analyze seepage through porous media and calculate water pressure in porous environments such as soil and rock hence seep w was used to carry out the seepage analysis of gale chay dam the steps of the fem simulation by seep w are comprised of geometric model construction mesh generation definition of material properties designation of boundary conditions solution of the governing equations along with the boundary conditions and visualization and interpretation of the results salmasi et al 2020 at last the obtained results were compared with the observed seepage value 3 results and discussion 3 1 measured and estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity the clay soil used in the dam core was collected from the dam core material borrow located at 37 31 20 1 north and 46 06 14 3 east in east azerbaijan province the in situ conditions including compaction of the specimens were applied to the gathered samples subsequently the falling head laboratory experiments were employed to measure the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the three samples for this purpose darcy s law for the hydraulic conductivity test was utilized as tavenas et al 1983 9 k s 2 3 ah a 1 t l o g h 1 h 2 where a is the cross sectional area of the permeability tube a is the cross sectional area of the specimen h is the height of the specimen and t is the time at which the water levels h1 and h2 have been measured in the permeability tube the results of the measured hydraulic conductivity by the falling head test are shown in table 2 it is important to mention that the falling head test was carried out three times for each sample and the results are provided in table 2 the average hydraulic conductivity for samples 1 2 and 3 are 4 17 10 8 5 32 10 8 and 3 2 10 8 m sec respectively it can be seen that the measured hydraulic conductivities of the core material are in the reported range by east azerbaijan regional water department indicated in table 1 to evaluate the viability of the saturated fractal model eq 2 the samples were analyzed by a scanning electron microscope for this purpose the freeze cut drying method was carried out to reduce the moisture content and prevent the shrinkage of the samples the samples were frozen immediately at 196 c after that the samples were cut with a sharp knife and subsequently they were dried in a vacuum for 48 h fig 4 a shows the gathered samples and fig 4 b indicates the prepared samples of the clay soil used in the dam core it is important to mention that several samples were gathered and analyzed to estimate the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the studied soil however only three samples corresponding to the maximum minimum and average hydraulic conductivity are presented here to indicate the prediction interval of the hydraulic conductivity and the seepage analysis the prepared samples shown in fig 4 b were analyzed via the scanning electron microscope of tescan mira3 feg sem to obtain the sem images of the gold coated samples the obtained sem images are shown in fig 4 c b and e for a soil sample gathered from different spots the porosity could be similar and close to each other however the distribution of the pores and porosity could vary from sample to sample which results in different permeability and hydraulic conductivity using the fractal notion the distribution of pores in three samples could be indicated by image processing of the obtained sem images represented by the fractal dimension d the captured images were in grayscale format with 512 512 pixels magnification of 3000 resolution of 0 082 μm pixel 1 and the side length of l 42 4 the grayscale images of three samples are shown in fig 4 as samples 1 2 and 3 the darker parts of the images indicate the porous space and the brighter parts are the particles the generated sem image of each sample was analyzed and the number n area a and diameter r of pores were measured using matlab software employing the defined procedure of step 1 in fig 3 a the results of the image processing phase are shown in fig 5 which illustrates the intensity map porous space detection and porous space segmentation of three samples respectively in fig 5 a fig 5 b and fig 5 c it was observed that four levels of quantization resulted in a good accuracy for porous space detection of sem images for the selected clay sample using multi level thresholding with four levels of quantization the intensity maps of the sem images were extracted and depicted in fig 5 a the darker parts of the sem images were determined and illustrated in fig 5 b on a solid white background moreover the segmented porous space of the clay samples is shown with a variety of random colors in fig 5 c table 3 shows the statistical data including the area number and diameter of the specified pores in fig 5 c by image processing of the samples the whole pore size range was divided into grades that were increased by 0 25 0 5 and 1 from zero to maximum diameter indicated by intervals of p1 p2 and p3 respectively the number of the categorized intervals for three samples indicated that the pore size could be classified into several groups referred to as pore size grades shown in table 3 to determine the fractal dimension from the statistical data provided in table 3 the scatter plots of the samples were drawn considering eq 1 in which l n r l and l n 1 a r a f describe the horizontal and vertical ordinates respectively therefore the fractal dimension d 2 k was calculated from l n 1 a r a f 2 d l n r l in which k indicates the slope of the fitted line to the data points the more the scattered data points of a sample become analogous to a straight line the better the fractal behavior of the pores in that sample becomes fig 6 illustrates the fitted lines to the scattered data points generated from the sem image analysis of the samples considering various pore intervals the correlation coefficient cc is a widely applied measure that indicates the linear correlation between two data sets which has values between 1 and 1 elkiran et al 2021 good fractal behavior in all samples was observed regarding the high cc of the fitted lines to the data points see fig 6 the naturally based formation of the soil structure might be the main factor in the resulted fractal behavior it is important to mention that the implication of the 2d sem images has some downsides in estimating the permeability of soil samples since it only considers the surface of the pores other methods such as mip can be applied to estimate the permeability in a more precise manner however considering the fact that sem images can be obtained easily and the permeability of the samples can be estimated readily with just a software and it possesses agreeable accuracy in this study sem image applied solely moreover the indicated high cc of the three samples in every pore interval shows that the porous environment is fractal therefore it is expected that the same hydraulic properties of samples e g permeability hydraulic conductivity etc be observed in all pore intervals corresponding to each sample using the image processing technique the fractal dimensions of the samples for each pore interval of p1 p2 and p3 were calculated from the slope of the fitted lines indicated in fig 6 afterward regarding the calculated fractal dimension of each sample the permeability and hydraulic conductivity of the soil samples were calculated using eqs 2 and 3 for each pore interval the calculated fractal dimensions in table 3 are somewhat different which might be due to the inhomogeneity of the collected soil specimen also considering the diverse distribution of the pores in the soil samples different fractal dimensions were obtained for the gathered samples see table 3 therefore the increased number of the investigated samples will result in less uncertainty in dealing with the estimated fractal dimensions as discussed before the calculated high ccs in fig 6 show that the porous soil structure is fractal and the fractal behavior must be observed in all pore intervals and the corresponding hydraulic properties the estimated permeability and hydraulic conductivities in table 3 acknowledge the aforementioned notion since the estimated permeability of each sample is close to the estimated permeabilities in each pore interval according to the provided data in table 4 the increase in fractal dimension d results in the increase of the tortuosity fractal dimension d t which in turn causes the decrease of permeability this was promising since the higher the tortuosity fractal dimension d t the more the tortuosity of the capillaries becomes as a result a higher resistance of flow transport in porous media is obtained which causes lower permeability and hydraulic conductivity also it can be observed that decreasing the pore intervals results in less permeability for the same soil sample however the alteration is negligible therefore the obtained results of pore interval p3 were considered as the estimated permeabilities of the soil samples since less computational effort is required for gaining the same results it can be seen that the calculated hydraulic conductivity of each sample was in the measured range of the saturated hydraulic conductivity indicated by laboratory experiments shown in table 1 the estimated hydraulic conductivities of the pore interval p3 were compared to the average values of the measured hydraulic conductivities for each sample shown in table 2 the relative errors of 0 7 2 and 2 8 were obtained for samples 1 2 and 3 respectively therefore the estimated hydraulic conductivities of all samples using fractal theory were in good agreement with the obtained hydraulic conductivities via the falling head experiment the implementation of fractal theory reduces the range of the estimated hydraulic conductivity for the soil material which provides a better view of the porous soil structure and water flow phenomenon as a result the proposed methodology for the estimation of saturated permeability and hydraulic conductivity with a more in depth view of the microstructure of the porous media can be considered an alternative alongside the actual measurements which are time consuming and expensive furthermore according to the probability density function with no restrictions in terms of pore size the proposed permeability model i e eq 2 provides more flexibility applicability and accuracy compared to other fractal models it has to be mentioned that the concept of representative elementary volume rev expresses that a sample must possess an adequate size to represent a specific physical property however in the early 1980 s by developing the concept of fractal geometry by mandelbrot 1982 it was theorized that fractal geometry of nature might cause natural objects e g soil show the same properties regardless of the level of observation hence it repudiates the rev concept since the fractal structure has irregular and convoluted geometries that are evident over various orders of resolution piccoli et al 2019 considering the outcomes of current research it was observed that the porous structure indicates high fractal behavior in all samples hence the resulted hydraulic conductivities were generalized for the whole soil sample moreover it is imperative to state that the self affine fractals are different from self similar fractals in a way that self affine fractals scale differently in various directions cousins et al 2018 in this study the fractal permeability model describes the self similarity of the porous environment and the self affinity of the soil is not considered the calculated saturated hydraulic conductivities were used in the next steps to estimate unsaturated hydraulic conductivities so that the saturated and unsaturated seepage analysis could be conducted 3 2 estimated unsaturated hydraulic conductivity according to the defined procedure in fig 3 b for estimating the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity first the swcc of the clay material must be determined for this purpose the given procedure in appendix b was employed using the available data of d 10 d 60 and ll as inputs of the seep w software according to east azerbaijan regional water department the values of d 10 d 60 and ll were reported to be 0 0031 mm 0 1665 mm and 28 respectively the generated results are shown as data points estimated value in fig 7 the required inputs for the unified fractal model are the fractal dimension d as well as the air entry value ψ a for the conventional models these parameters entail θ s θ r α n and m which indicate the saturated volumetric water content at saturation degree residual volumetric water content the inverse of air entry value pore distribution index and symmetry of the characteristic curve the conventional swcc models of van genuchten 1980 i e eq b 4 with both restrictions of m 1 2 n vgb and m 1 1 n vgm as well as the fractal swcc model of tao et al 2019 i e eq b 7 were fitted to the generated data points to derive the required parameters for estimating the relative hydraulic conductivity the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse are two metrics to evaluate the performance of the modeling fig 7 indicates the calculated r2 values for the fitted models also table 5 demonstrates the estimated parameters of the conventional vgb and vgm and fractal tao et al 2019 swcc models via the nonlinear least squares fitting procedure according to the presented r2 values in fig 7 and the provided rmse values in table 5 it is declared that the fractal swcc model of tao et al 2019 led to a slightly better performance than the conventional models of van genuchten 1980 with both restrictions vgb and vgm especially in the area near the air entry value furthermore the fractal swcc model reduced the number of required parameters to d and ψ a which have clear physical definitions and can be estimated using less time consuming approaches thus the fractal swcc model requires less computational effort in terms of application and can be used more conveniently the generated parameters of the conventional and fractal swcc models shown in table 5 were then used for estimating the relative hydraulic conductivities with the conventional models of vgb vgm i e eqs b 5 and b 6 and the unified fractal model i e eq b 8 according to the provided fractal dimension d 2 569 in table 5 and the specified ranges of fractal dimension in table b 1 the developed models of tao et al 2019 based on burdine 1953 tb and mualem 1976 tm models were chosen for estimating the relative hydraulic conductivities with the fractal perspective regarding table b 1 the generated parameters of table 5 and eqs b 5 b 6 b 8 the relative hydraulic conductivities of vgb vgm tb and tm were estimated as shown in fig 8 a as shown in fig 8 a the estimated relative hydraulic conductivities using the fractal models of tm and tb are almost identical therefore it can be concluded that the estimated seepage via the approximated tb and tm unsaturated hydraulic conductivities could result in the same value the mentioned perception might also be correct using the conventional models of vgb and vgm as the generated relative hydraulic conductivity curves are close to each other furthermore considering the estimated relative hydraulic conductivities provided in fig 8 a the value of the estimated unsaturated seepage by tm model might be higher than the estimated seepage using the other relative hydraulic conductivities since in the same matric suction the estimated tm relative hydraulic conductivity provides higher hydraulic conductivity than the models of tb vgb and vgm in the same manner the seepage values obtained by the tb model have to be higher than the seepage yielded by both vgb and vgm models according to the illustrated steps in fig 3 b the approximated relative hydraulic conductivities were used to estimate the unsaturated hydraulic conductivities considering eq b 3 in this way the generated relative hydraulic conductivities in fig 8 a were multiplied by the saturated hydraulic conductivities fig 8 b c d e and f depict the estimated unsaturated hydraulic conductivities using fractal and conventional models with different values for the saturated hydraulic conductivity fig 8 b c d e and f depict the estimated unsaturated hydraulic conductivities using fractal and conventional models with different values for the saturated hydraulic conductivity i e minimum maximum minimum fractal maximum fractal and average fractal for evaluating the influence of the quantity of saturated hydraulic conductivity on the unsaturated seepage analysis the minimum and maximum values of the saturated hydraulic conductivity in the measured range i e 10 8 and 1 2 10 7 m sec respectively were used for approximation of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity values also the estimated saturated hydraulic conductivities by the fractal notion and image processing technique i e minimum fractal maximum fractal and average fractal were used for the estimation of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity as well as can be seen in fig 8 the estimated unsaturated hydraulic conductivities using the conventional and fractal models are almost identical however the values of saturated hydraulic conductivities are different the estimated unsaturated hydraulic conductivities were utilized in the next step to conduct the unsaturated seepage analysis 3 3 results of the seepage analysis due to several uncertainties of laboratory experiments an upper and a lower limit for the hydraulic conductivity of materials are reported which have a direct impact on the amount of seepage fredlund et al 1994 the objective of this study is to indicate how the measured upper lower limit results in an over underestimation of the seepage value to conduct the seepage analysis of the gale chay dam at first the geometric model of the dam was constructed in seep w software for this purpose the indicated cross section no 2 in fig 2 was divided into quadratic elements with different mesh sizes however the 3 meter mesh size was chosen for the seepage analysis since negligible alterations were seen while reducing the mesh size and the seepage results converged later the material properties including the estimated hydraulic conductivities in the previous section were defined for various parts of the dam subsequently the boundary conditions were set as the upstream and downstream heads of 1670 and 1600 m respectively the estimated saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivities obtained via eqs 3 and b 3 respectively were utilized in this step to carry out the saturated and unsaturated seepage analysis furthermore to make a reasonable comparison of the effect of the fractal notion on the accuracy of the estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity and considering the measured hydraulic conductivity value of the core material in table 1 the minimum and maximum amounts i e 10 8 and 1 2 10 7 m sec respectively were utilized for employing the seepage analysis alongside the estimated fractal hydraulic conductivities for the saturated condition in a similar approach and to study the impact of the value of the saturated hydraulic conductivity on the unsaturated seepage analysis the mentioned minimum and maximum saturated hydraulic conductivities of the measured range were used for estimating the unsaturated hydraulic conductivities via both conventional and fractal models to see the upper and lower bonds of the estimations and modeling uncertainty according to the range of the measured hydraulic conductivity in the saturated condition for the core material and the estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity via fractal theory the saturated seepage analysis was conducted in this regard five values of the saturated hydraulic conductivity were utilized two of which were measured by laboratory experiments minimum 10 8 m sec and maximum 1 2 10 7 m sec and three of which were estimated by the image processing of the gathered samples maximum fractal 5 42 10 8 m sec minimum fractal 3 29 10 8 m sec and average fractal 4 20 10 8 m sec it is necessary to reiterate that the objective of this study is the application of the fractal hydraulic conductivity models in the seepage analysis of earth fill dams and the results might not be in good accordance with the observed seepage the estimated seepage values of both saturated and unsaturated conditions and the corresponding relative errors are presented in table 6 the calculated relative errors revealed that the maximum hydraulic conductivity obtained by laboratory experiments resulted in a 45 error in seepage estimation which is higher than the observed value therefore it can be noted that the application of the measured maximum hydraulic conductivity yields an uneconomical design with a high safety factor however the minimum value of hydraulic conductivity results in the least seepage that is lower than the observed value with a relative error of 11 6 hence the safety factor would be inferior and hazardous for the stability of the dam employing the estimated maximum fractal hydraulic conductivity in the saturated seepage analysis the relative error was reduced to 15 6 which led to an enhanced seepage estimation by approximately 65 compared to the resulting seepage in the case of utilizing the maximum hydraulic conductivity therefore in terms of economic aspects the implication of maximum fractal hydraulic conductivity is more reliable than the measured maximum hydraulic conductivity the minimum fractal hydraulic conductivity provided an error of 8 in saturated seepage analysis which was a preferable choice considering the safety factor in comparison to the corresponding minimum hydraulic conductivity as indicated in table 1 also the minimum fractal hydraulic conductivity improved the accuracy of the seepage analysis with a ratio of almost 49 compared to when the maximum fractal hydraulic conductivity was used for the modeling considering the average fractal hydraulic conductivity the estimated seepage was observed to present a relative error of 10 8 which is more reliable than the cases of implementing the minimum and maximum hydraulic conductivities of the measured range however compared to the estimated minimum fractal hydraulic conductivity the accuracy of the seepage analysis was diminished by 35 which in turn could yield a higher safety factor for the dam design the core material of the dam is considered to be in the unsaturated condition to achieve more realistic seepage modeling later the unsaturated seepage analysis was conducted considering twenty developed unsaturated hydraulic conductivities of the conventional vgb and vgm and fractal tb and tm models considering five saturated hydraulic conductivities the results of the unsaturated seepage estimation are presented in table 6 alongside the calculated relative errors derived from the comparison of the estimated and observed seepage values the phreatic line estimated water head and flow paths of the saturated and unsaturated seepage analysis are illustrated in fig 9 since the average fractal hydraulic conductivity resulted in the most accurate seepage estimations in both saturated and unsaturated conditions the illustrated phreatic surfaces in fig 9 are related to the ones obtained from the average fractal hydraulic conductivity as shown in fig 9 the estimated phreatic lines obtained via different hydraulic conductivity models are almost identical it is important to mention that the water level of the installed piezometers alter during the time hence in this study the estimated seepages were directly compared with observed value however in order to have a better view of the water flow through the dam the results of physical base model i e fem were compared with the observed water heads in different piezometers indicate in fig 2 then for each model the relative errors were calculated see table 7 considering the provided relative errors in table 7 the fem model using the unsaturated notion led to higher accuracy than the saturated condition this was promising since the unsaturated condition considers the existing suction in water flow phenomenon which is close to reality considering estimated the water levels in piezometer number 207 213 the fem model could make acceptable estimations in both saturated and unsaturated conditions however in piezometers number 214 217 the unsaturated assumption outperforms the saturated condition this issue can be seen in fig 9 since the estimated water levels for the unsaturated condition are closer to the observed values the indicated phreatic surfaces of unsaturated condition in fig 9 are more reliable according to the given relative errors in table 6 it can be declared that in general the application of the unsaturated condition led to lower seepage values compared to the saturated case considering the mentioned point it could be concluded that the maximum hydraulic conductivity yielded optimized seepage estimation by an average of 28 employing the unsaturated conventional and fractal models compared to its corresponding saturated condition however according to the high relative errors obtained from the unsaturated seepage analysis the implementation of the maximum hydraulic conductivity led to an over designed condition the minimum hydraulic conductivity resulted in lower estimated seepage values by both conventional and fractal models compared to the parallel analysis carried out with the maximum hydraulic conductivity additionally the measured minimum hydraulic conductivity deteriorated the unsaturated seepage analysis by an average of 74 compared to its corresponding saturated analysis consequently it could be denoted that the implication of the minimum hydraulic conductivity led to a more perilous design in the unsaturated condition considering the maximum fractal hydraulic conductivity the unsaturated soil state led to an enhanced seepage analysis by an average of 49 compared to its saturated notion also the application of the maximum fractal hydraulic conductivity improved the accuracy of the unsaturated seepage analysis by an average of 72 in comparison to the case of using the maximum hydraulic conductivity by both conventional and fractal models the minimum fractal hydraulic conductivity yielded seepage values less than the observed amount in all cases which led to negative relative errors however the unsaturated seepage analysis using the estimated minimum fractal hydraulic conductivity was improved with an average of 89 in comparison to the unsaturated analysis conducted by the measured minimum hydraulic conductivity via both conventional and fractal models the estimated average fractal hydraulic conductivity presented the most accurate seepage analysis in the unsaturated condition which enhanced the precision of the analysis by an average of 80 compared to the corresponding saturated condition considering the presented relative errors in table 6 it can be denoted that the computed seepage values by the fractal models of tb and tm provided slightly higher approximations than the commonly used models of vgb and vgm for all conditions as a result it can be concluded that the unified fractal model can be considered a proper alternative for estimating unsaturated hydraulic conductivity moreover since the existing parameters of the unsaturated fractal models possess physical definitions the fractal dimension d as a parameter defining the complexity of the porous structure and the air entry value ψ a which is related to the maximum pore diameter these models present a more in depth understanding of the soil texture and water flow through the porous media also the mentioned parameters can be estimated using less expensive and less time consuming approaches such as mip test and image processing which makes the application of the unsaturated fractal models more convenient in practice compared to the conventional models as was discussed priorly the purpose of this study was the implementation of fractal hydraulic conductivity in seepage analysis of earth fill dams the results showed that the fractal models could be considered potential tools in seepage estimation the mentioned point is for the reason that classic methods of hydraulic conductivity estimation consider the porosity of the soil medium solely however using the fractal theory the distribution of the voids can be assessed as well furthermore it was observed that using the fractal theory a reliable prediction interval of seepage analysis was obtained compared to the prediction interval resulting from the measured hydraulic conductivity by the laboratory experiments which again highlights the prominence of the distribution of complexities pores in this case using the fractal dimension d 4 conclusions in this paper the seepage analysis of gale chay dam was carried out using fem considering both saturated and unsaturated conditions for the core material a novel approach via fractal theory was used for describing the porous media and estimating the hydraulic conductivities in saturated and unsaturated conditions considering the saturated state the gathered soil samples were analyzed using the image processing technique and the fractal permeability model was employed to estimate the saturated hydraulic conductivity it was concluded that the gathered samples had almost the same porosity with different distributions of pores indicated by the fractal dimension the saturated seepage analysis of the dam was conducted using five hydraulic conductivities of the maximum minimum maximum fractal minimum fractal and average fractal the estimated seepage results indicated that the maximum and minimum hydraulic conductivities eventuated uneconomical and unsafe designs respectively however the estimated fractal hydraulic conductivities provided safer and more economical designs with reasonable relative error values in seepage analysis hence it was concluded that considering the pore size distribution by the fractal theory presented a more exact estimation of the hydraulic conductivity that can be implemented alongside the actual measurement to gain a more detailed understanding of the porous media for a better seepage estimation the unsaturated seepage analysis was conducted employing the conventional and novel unsaturated fractal hydraulic conductivity models considering eq b 3 the saturated hydraulic conductivities as well as the estimated relative hydraulic conductivities with conventional and fractal models twenty unsaturated hydraulic conductivities were generated the obtained results of the seepage analysis indicated that the unsaturated soil state reduced the value of estimated seepage using all twenty models moreover it was observed that the unsaturated seepage analysis is highly affected by the value of the saturated hydraulic conductivity the generated unsaturated models by the estimated saturated fractal hydraulic conductivities resulted in improved seepage analysis compared to the developed models with the maximum and minimum hydraulic conductivities measured in the laboratory moreover it was concluded that the implementation of the estimated average fractal hydraulic conductivity for the approximation of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivities with both conventional and fractal models resulted in a more accurate seepage analysis by an average of 80 compared to its corresponding saturated seepage analysis additionally considering the fractal models of tb and tm the seepage estimations were close to the results gained by the conventional models of vgb and vgm hence it was concluded that the unsaturated fractal models could be used as viable alternatives in unsaturated seepage analysis since these models possess parameters that can be estimated more conveniently with less computational effort based on the provided results of this research to design and employ the seepage analysis of earth fill dams it is recommended to calculate and report the fractal dimension d of the soil porous structure alongside the measured porosity of the soil sample this is due to the fact that the permeability and hydraulic conductivity of the porous medium depend not only on the porosity but also on the distribution of the pores in that porous media which can be defined by the concept of fractal dimension for future studies physically based dam models can be constructed and the measured seepage can be compared with the 3d numerical simulations in this way the proposed methodology of this study can be applied to further investigate the merits of fractal theory in seepage analysis also to estimate the fractal dimension of the samples other methods such as the mip experiment and image processing of the 3d computed tomography ct images can be applied the application of the mentioned experiments on soil samples would provide a more realistic understanding of the soil structure as the existing pores contain a volume of the environment also the soil volume change hysteresis of swcc and advanced numerical algorithms can be considered in future studies to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the soil hydraulic properties and water flow through porous environment credit authorship contribution statement vahid

3049,one of the most important factors concerning the design of earth fill dams is the accurate seepage estimation which is highly correlated to the permeability and hydraulic conductivity of the core material with the geographic coordinates of 37 31 35 9 north and 46 07 55 6 east gale chay dam is located in the northwest of iran in east azerbaijan province the dam is highly important regarding the provided economic benefits for the region in this research the steady state seepage analysis of the gale chay dam was conducted via the finite element model fem using a novel saturated fractal hydraulic conductivity model and the results were compared with those obtained from the conventional and fractal models in the unsaturated condition for estimating the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the core material the fractal theory was employed using the image processing technique the scanning electron microscope sem images and a new fractal permeability model the estimated saturated hydraulic conductivities were in good accordance with the measured values furthermore since the fractal theory considers the distribution of the pores the estimated upper and lower bounds of the saturated hydraulic conductivity resulted in better seepage estimations using the estimated maximum minimum and average fractal hydraulic conductivities the results of the saturated seepage analysis indicated relative errors of 15 6 8 and 10 8 compared to the observed seepage the results were acceptable in terms of safety and economic aspects conducting the unsaturated seepage analysis it was observed that the estimated seepage was highly influenced by the saturated hydraulic conductivity value hence the estimated average fractal hydraulic conductivity by the image processing technique affected the unsaturated fractal and conventional models in a way that the unsaturated seepage analysis was improved by an average of 80 moreover the unsaturated fractal model revealed reliable estimations compared to the conventional models and was considered a feasible alternative for estimating the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity keywords seepage analysis hydraulic conductivity finite element model fem scanning electron microscope sem fractal dimension gale chay dam data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hydraulic conductivity is critical in the accurate description of the water flow in a porous environment zhang and schaap 2019 several laboratory experiments are usually performed to measure the hydraulic conductivity of a soil specimen however since the experiments are long lasting and laborious several functions have been developed to estimate hydraulic conductivity more readily dai et al 2013 zhai and rahardjo 2015 it has been indicated that hydraulic conductivity is directly related to the permeability of the soil which is an intrinsic parameter associated with the microstructure of the soil texture grant 2005 zhai et al 2018 therefore to gain a more accurate estimation of hydraulic conductivity it is indispensable to study the porous soil structure precisely accordingly it was declared that porous media could be defined as a fractal object of nature xu 2015 fractals are a novel type of geometry introduced by mandelbrot 1982 whose main intention was to study the irregular or fragmented forms that euclidian geometry considers amorphous it was noted that the complexity of a porous structure i e pore or particle size distribution could be identified by the concept of fractal dimension zarnaghi et al 2018 the fractal dimension of a porous medium has been derived from a variety of approaches including the image processing of the sem images dong et al 2020 zou et al 2020 dou et al 2021 and the mercury intrusion porosimetry mip test zarnaghi et al 2018 song et al 2019 ding et al 2020 based on fractal theory several permeability models both saturated and unsaturated have already been developed for porous media for instance a fractal permeability model for bi dispersed porous media was proposed by yu and cheng 2002 which was related to the pore area fractal dimension and it was observed that the predicted fractal permeabilities are in good agreement with the measured data xu and sun 2002 derived an expression for the relative hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated porous media based on fractal dimension in this study the mip method was used to obtain the fractal dimension of mass volume furthermore the study revealed that the fractal dimension of a porous media could be driven by fitting the fractal soil water characteristic curve swcc function to the available swcc data points if the mip method is not accessible based on the fractal nature of the porous environment yu and liu 2004 established a fractal permeability model for both saturated and unsaturated conditions without any empirical parameters the proposed models indicated good agreement with the existing measurements regarding porosity maximum pore size and fractal dimension xu and yu 2008 proposed an analytical expression for the permeability of the porous media subsequently the kc constant was expressed based on the fractal geometry in a review article yu 2008 showed that fractal geometry and techniques are capable of flow analysis and the description of transport properties in a porous environment a fractal permeability model for fractured rocks was developed based on fractal geometry theory it was observed that the proposed expression is related to the fractal dimension of the fractured area the mentioned model was verified by comparing the numerical simulations and the model predictions miao et al 2015 presenting analytical derivations and considering the particle and pore surface areas equal and constant the defining parameters of swcc were related to particle and pore geometry information in this way the fractal dimension of particle size distribution was employed and it was pointed out that an swcc for a single void ratio could also be applied to void ratios of any other sort using just the particle size distribution russell 2014 using fractal dimensions for pore and grain size distribution khoshghalb et al 2015 proposed a fractal swcc model based on soil volume change effects considering no particle crushing the fractal dimension of particle size distribution was assumed to be constant and the same pore size distribution was noted to be dependent on the void ratio the results indicated good agreement with the experimental data a fractal based hydraulic conductivity model was developed by yang et al 2014 using swcc data having hydraulic hysteresis accordingly the pore geometry was considered a fractal pattern and a direct relationship between the microstructure of soils and hydraulic parameters was observed also the results obtained from this research were in good agreement with the measurements soto et al 2017 investigated the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of pore structure from the fractal point of view the results highlighted that the proposed models agreed well with the observed data furthermore it was declared that in the absence of laboratory experiments the fractal based model could be a reliable alternative for predicting soil hydraulic properties a simple constitutive model was proposed by soldi et al 2017 in which the hysteresis phenomenon was expressed to describe the unsaturated flow and the performance of the model was tested and verified with the experimental data tao et al 2019 derived the unified fractal model for unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of soils based on the fractal form of swcc in which only two parameters named fractal dimension and air entry value were included in the model accordingly the proposed model could efficiently estimate the hydraulic conductivity of different soil types a permeability model has been established for the porous environment based on soil properties such as porosity grain size and pore size the model was approvingly compared with the existing permeability models and experimental data jougnot et al 2021 the majority of the aforementioned permeability and hydraulic conductivity models utilize the conventional assumption of λ min λ max d 10 2 where λmin and λmax are the minimum and maximum pore diameters however the actual porous media entails a wide variety of pores containing large and small ones with this regard an improved model for permeability of the porous media was presented by shen et al 2018 where a novel probability density function was defined with no restriction in terms of pore radii which expanded the applicability of the fractal theory for permeability estimation in several studies it is emphasized to use the fractal permeability and hydraulic conductivity functions in engineering practices such as seepage analysis of a porous media zhai et al 2021 however the existing fractal functions in the literature seem to be scarcely employed for this issue also the hydraulic conductivity coefficient is of immense importance with a wide range of divergence where this variation can act as a hurdle in seepage analysis through a porous environment the upper and lower bonds of permeability are usually determined and utilized in seepage analysis fredlund et al 1994 therefore it is imperative to gain a more precise estimation of permeability so that the seepage analysis becomes exact as well earth fill dams are among the most widely constructed civil engineering projects to store and transfer water according to several studies this type of dam is highly susceptible to internal erosion or piping phenomenon nourani et al 2012 fell et al 2014 hence it is crucial to ensure that the accurate estimation of seepage is considered in the designing of an earth fill dam to achieve such accuracy it is vital to make precise estimations of the dam materials hydraulic conductivities especially the clay material used in the dam core as it plays a critical role in water flow prevention different approaches have been utilized to investigate the seepage of an earth fill dam these methods mainly entail fem artificial neural networks anns and physical models nourani et al 2012 al janabi et al 2020 as a result of the existing uncertainties in permeability and hydraulic conductivity estimations consulting engineers and scholars often provide an upper and lower limit for the mentioned parameters this in itself leads to a prediction interval in seepage analysis hence providing a better estimation of hydraulic conductivity can have a significant impact on the seepage analysis and design of a dam considering the mentioned studies in permeability and hydraulic conductivity and the technical literature review it is clear that the fractal hydraulic conductivity models for both saturated and unsaturated soils could be employed as viable alternatives to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of a soil sample with desirable accuracies furthermore to the best of our knowledge it seems there is not any study regarding the implication of fractal hydraulic conductivity in seepage modeling and estimation of the earth fill dams the application of the fractal hydraulic conductivity model can be highly effective in the accurate seepage analysis as it not only considers the porosity of the porous media but also considers the distribution of such pores within the soil structure this study aimed to model and estimate seepage through gale chay earth fill dam using fem in both saturated and unsaturated conditions in this way the fractal and conventional hydraulic conductivity models were employed on sem images of gathered clay material to examine the merits of fractal theory in the accuracy of the seepage estimation 2 case study dam considering the availability of the data gale chay dam was chosen for the seepage analysis in the current study the dam is located on the gale chay river in ajabshir county east azerbaijan iran it is a zoned earth fill dam with a clay core built on an alluvial foundation and the body consists of shell transition and drain materials see fig 1 the annual discharge of the river at the dam site in the maximum water level with a reservoir area of 250 square kilometers is equivalent to 76 million cubic meters the dam was constructed for various purposes such as irrigation fish farming and hydropower generation and it contributes a significant role to the economic aspects of the region therefore it is of prime importance to evaluate the accurate amount of seepage through the dam body for monitoring the safety issues several piezometers have been placed at the four cross sections of the dam two of which are on both sides of the dam and the other two are at the middle part of the valley with maximum area section fig 2 indicates section no 2 of the gale chay dam as can be seen in fig 2 three lines of piezometer were placed in cross section no 2 the first line which is placed at a short distance from the bedrock consists of four piezometers numbers 207 211 the second line of the piezometers is placed in the middle of the cross section and contains three piezometers and the third line is comprised of three piezometers as well water levels in the piezometers have been monitored by east azerbaijan regional water department fig 2 depicts the piezometers positions and the different parts of the dam each of these parts has a specific hydraulic conductivity table 1 illustrates the saturated hydraulic conductivity of different dam parts measured by the laboratory experiments based on the gathered samples in situ and laboratory experiments have been conducted to estimate the saturated hydraulic conductivities of various materials indicated in table 1 for shell toe drain and transition materials the constant head laboratory experiments were conducted and for the core material the falling head experiment was carried out also the lugeon test was conducted on ten boreholes of 525 m to indicate the permeability and hydraulic conductivity of the upper and lower foundations the mentioned experiments were carried out by east azerbaijan regional water department and the data were acquired from the same organization the prominent material preventing the seepage is the dam core material as can be seen from table 1 the hydraulic conductivity of the core material is in a range where the lower minimum and upper maximum bounds are 1 10 8 and 1 2 10 7 m sec respectively also the observed average seepage amount of the dam has been measured using thin plate weirs and reported by east azerbaijan regional water department to be 2 5 10 5 m3 sec m at the maximum water level in the current study the seepage analysis of the gale chay dam was conducted in saturated and unsaturated conditions for the dam core material in this way the fractal theory was employed to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of the gathered samples fig 3 shows the schematic diagram of the proposed methodology which consists of several phases in three major steps within the modeling framework at the first step the permeability and the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the core material are estimated using the gathered samples fractal permeability model and image processing technique in the second step the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the core material is estimated via grain size distribution gsd data and both conventional and fractal models the third step is the seepage analysis and estimation by the fem and the previously estimated saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity values a detailed explanation of the proposed methodology is presented in the following sub sections 2 1 sample preparation and image processing sem images are often utilized to assess the microstructure of the porous medium preparing the specimen for sem analysis is a vital step that majorly includes two imperative phases eliminating the fluid occupying the pores and generating a flat monitoring surface for achieving the mentioned purposes in this study the freeze cut drying method was implemented on the clay soil samples the traditional methods of air drying and oven drying especially for the soils with high water content result in severe shrinkage of the sample thus the specimen will undergo significant microstructural changes the freeze cut drying method however reduces the shrinkage of the soil sample significantly shi et al 1999 the freeze cut drying process involves a freezing step at first in which the specimen is entirely soaked in liquid nitrogen immediately which causes the rapid freezing of the water in the pores the quick freezing of the water in the voids prevents the formation of crystal ice in the pores which gives a non disturbed microstructure of the soil specimen to gain a smooth surface which entails various microstructural levels of the pores the samples were diced with a sharp cutter subsequently the drying step was carried out in a freeze dryer for 48 h yuan et al 2019 in order to identify the pore size distribution using the fractal theory sem images were analyzed in the current study the image processing procedure of the study was carried out regarding the developed method of rabbani and salehi 2017 the darker spots in the sem images represent the voids for fluid transport the otsu multi level thresholding technique was employed to separate the darkest parts of the sem images such that the lowest standard deviation of intensity in each segment could be driven otsu 1979 then the watershed algorithm was used to separate the porous space which can precisely detect and segment the overlaying porous patterns the city block method was then applied as the distance transform in watershed segmentation coupled with the noise reduction method of median filtering the procedure for detecting the pore size distribution of the generated sem images is presented in fig 3 a within step 1 of the methodology the procedure yields the area of pores a the diameter of the pores r and the number of the pores n all of which are necessary to estimate the fractal based saturated hydraulic conductivity 2 2 fractal permeability model mandelbrot 1982 defined the fractal theory to describe the self similarity of natural objects and irregular patterns considering the complicated structure of porous media the previously developed geometric models could not accurately estimate the permeability of the porous medium however the development of the fractal theory led to significant improvements in permeability related research shen et al 2018 furthermore the application of the fractal models provides the investigation of the distribution of the voids in a porous sample hence it will be possible to obtain different distributions of pores with similar porosity for a soil structure one of the broadly used assumptions for developing the porosity model of a porous medium is the sierpinski carpet pattern liu et al 2021 to generate the sierpinski carpet the main square with the length of l is divided into nine even squares and the middle one is eliminated then the same process is implemented for the remaining squares assuming the pore filling method which utilizes the eliminated squares of the sierpinski carpet as the voids of the porous structure the pore area can be defined as shen et al 2018 1 a r a f 1 r l 2 d where a f l 2 defines the area of the field and r is the pore diameter in the microscopic scale hagen poiseuille equation for the flow rate in a single tube was utilized to formulate the total flow of the media subsequently using darcy s law shen et al 2018 developed a permeability model for fractal porous media as 2 k π 128 l 0 1 d t a f 2 d 3 d t d 3 r max 3 d t 1 r min r max 3 d t d 1 r min r max 3 where l 0 is the side length of the square field of view and a f indicates the area of the field of view the maximum and minimum pore diameters are defined by r max and r min respectively also d t shows the tortuosity fractal dimension in two dimensional space it has been observed that the saturated hydraulic conductivity is related to the fluid density and viscosity as well as the structure of the porous media as grant 2005 3 k s k ρ g η where η and ρ are the viscosity and the density of the fluid g is the gravitational constant and k specifies the intrinsic permeability of the porous media which can be estimated using fractal theory by eq 2 the flow channels in the porous materials are considered to be composed of a bundle of tortuous capillary tubes in which the tortuosity fractal dimension of the media can be defined as 4 d t 1 ln τ av ln l r av 5 τ av 1 2 1 1 φ 2 1 1 φ 2 1 φ 4 1 1 φ where τ av is average tortuosity r av indicates the average pore diameter φ is the porosity and f r is the probability density function also the porosity fractal model is defined as shen et al 2018 6 φ φ r min 1 1 a r max a f r r max 2 d furthermore according to the unrestricted probability density function derived by shen et al 2018 the average pore diameter i e eq 9 can also be considered as 7 r av d r min d 1 1 r min r max d 1 fig 3 b depicts the second step required for estimating the saturated hydraulic conductivity from the image processing of the soil specimens based on fractal theory via the mentioned formulas considering fig 3 the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is calculated after the saturated hydraulic conductivity estimation which entails swcc and relative hydraulic conductivity estimation the details of formulas and the employed procedure have been explained in appendices a and b 2 3 governing equation for seepage estimation the classical richards equation was assumed to be the governing equation for water transport in the porous media for the saturated and unsaturated conditions townsend et al 2015 the governing differential equation for the isotropic case in the steady state condition can be written as fredlund 2006 8 x k u h x y k u h y q 0 where h is the water head t is the time θ declares the volumetric water content and k u specifies the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity which can be defined as k u k r k s in which k s and k r are the saturated and relative hydraulic conductivity respectively considering the water flow occurring through the saturated zone the relative hydraulic conductivity equals one fu and sheng 2009 a set of proper boundary conditions must be specified as either a hydraulic head or a flow rate on the boundary nodal points to solve eq 8 fu and sheng 2009 the defined hydraulic heads at the boundary nodes are called the dirichlet boundary conditions also the specified flow rates across the boundary are called neumann boundary conditions fredlund 2006 the fem is one of the appropriate numerical methods to discretize and solve eq 8 on the spatial domain which is widely utilized for two dimensional problems in the current study as the steady state seepage analysis was considered to be conducted the galerkin solution of the weighted residuals method was employed to solve eq 8 the finite element equation for two dimensional steady state seepage can be reviewed in fredlund 2006 to accomplish the aims of this study the geo studio package was utilized for numerical simulation seep w is integrated into geo studio allowing it to build and analyze models using geo studio tools in seep w fem is employed to analyze seepage through porous media and calculate water pressure in porous environments such as soil and rock hence seep w was used to carry out the seepage analysis of gale chay dam the steps of the fem simulation by seep w are comprised of geometric model construction mesh generation definition of material properties designation of boundary conditions solution of the governing equations along with the boundary conditions and visualization and interpretation of the results salmasi et al 2020 at last the obtained results were compared with the observed seepage value 3 results and discussion 3 1 measured and estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity the clay soil used in the dam core was collected from the dam core material borrow located at 37 31 20 1 north and 46 06 14 3 east in east azerbaijan province the in situ conditions including compaction of the specimens were applied to the gathered samples subsequently the falling head laboratory experiments were employed to measure the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the three samples for this purpose darcy s law for the hydraulic conductivity test was utilized as tavenas et al 1983 9 k s 2 3 ah a 1 t l o g h 1 h 2 where a is the cross sectional area of the permeability tube a is the cross sectional area of the specimen h is the height of the specimen and t is the time at which the water levels h1 and h2 have been measured in the permeability tube the results of the measured hydraulic conductivity by the falling head test are shown in table 2 it is important to mention that the falling head test was carried out three times for each sample and the results are provided in table 2 the average hydraulic conductivity for samples 1 2 and 3 are 4 17 10 8 5 32 10 8 and 3 2 10 8 m sec respectively it can be seen that the measured hydraulic conductivities of the core material are in the reported range by east azerbaijan regional water department indicated in table 1 to evaluate the viability of the saturated fractal model eq 2 the samples were analyzed by a scanning electron microscope for this purpose the freeze cut drying method was carried out to reduce the moisture content and prevent the shrinkage of the samples the samples were frozen immediately at 196 c after that the samples were cut with a sharp knife and subsequently they were dried in a vacuum for 48 h fig 4 a shows the gathered samples and fig 4 b indicates the prepared samples of the clay soil used in the dam core it is important to mention that several samples were gathered and analyzed to estimate the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the studied soil however only three samples corresponding to the maximum minimum and average hydraulic conductivity are presented here to indicate the prediction interval of the hydraulic conductivity and the seepage analysis the prepared samples shown in fig 4 b were analyzed via the scanning electron microscope of tescan mira3 feg sem to obtain the sem images of the gold coated samples the obtained sem images are shown in fig 4 c b and e for a soil sample gathered from different spots the porosity could be similar and close to each other however the distribution of the pores and porosity could vary from sample to sample which results in different permeability and hydraulic conductivity using the fractal notion the distribution of pores in three samples could be indicated by image processing of the obtained sem images represented by the fractal dimension d the captured images were in grayscale format with 512 512 pixels magnification of 3000 resolution of 0 082 μm pixel 1 and the side length of l 42 4 the grayscale images of three samples are shown in fig 4 as samples 1 2 and 3 the darker parts of the images indicate the porous space and the brighter parts are the particles the generated sem image of each sample was analyzed and the number n area a and diameter r of pores were measured using matlab software employing the defined procedure of step 1 in fig 3 a the results of the image processing phase are shown in fig 5 which illustrates the intensity map porous space detection and porous space segmentation of three samples respectively in fig 5 a fig 5 b and fig 5 c it was observed that four levels of quantization resulted in a good accuracy for porous space detection of sem images for the selected clay sample using multi level thresholding with four levels of quantization the intensity maps of the sem images were extracted and depicted in fig 5 a the darker parts of the sem images were determined and illustrated in fig 5 b on a solid white background moreover the segmented porous space of the clay samples is shown with a variety of random colors in fig 5 c table 3 shows the statistical data including the area number and diameter of the specified pores in fig 5 c by image processing of the samples the whole pore size range was divided into grades that were increased by 0 25 0 5 and 1 from zero to maximum diameter indicated by intervals of p1 p2 and p3 respectively the number of the categorized intervals for three samples indicated that the pore size could be classified into several groups referred to as pore size grades shown in table 3 to determine the fractal dimension from the statistical data provided in table 3 the scatter plots of the samples were drawn considering eq 1 in which l n r l and l n 1 a r a f describe the horizontal and vertical ordinates respectively therefore the fractal dimension d 2 k was calculated from l n 1 a r a f 2 d l n r l in which k indicates the slope of the fitted line to the data points the more the scattered data points of a sample become analogous to a straight line the better the fractal behavior of the pores in that sample becomes fig 6 illustrates the fitted lines to the scattered data points generated from the sem image analysis of the samples considering various pore intervals the correlation coefficient cc is a widely applied measure that indicates the linear correlation between two data sets which has values between 1 and 1 elkiran et al 2021 good fractal behavior in all samples was observed regarding the high cc of the fitted lines to the data points see fig 6 the naturally based formation of the soil structure might be the main factor in the resulted fractal behavior it is important to mention that the implication of the 2d sem images has some downsides in estimating the permeability of soil samples since it only considers the surface of the pores other methods such as mip can be applied to estimate the permeability in a more precise manner however considering the fact that sem images can be obtained easily and the permeability of the samples can be estimated readily with just a software and it possesses agreeable accuracy in this study sem image applied solely moreover the indicated high cc of the three samples in every pore interval shows that the porous environment is fractal therefore it is expected that the same hydraulic properties of samples e g permeability hydraulic conductivity etc be observed in all pore intervals corresponding to each sample using the image processing technique the fractal dimensions of the samples for each pore interval of p1 p2 and p3 were calculated from the slope of the fitted lines indicated in fig 6 afterward regarding the calculated fractal dimension of each sample the permeability and hydraulic conductivity of the soil samples were calculated using eqs 2 and 3 for each pore interval the calculated fractal dimensions in table 3 are somewhat different which might be due to the inhomogeneity of the collected soil specimen also considering the diverse distribution of the pores in the soil samples different fractal dimensions were obtained for the gathered samples see table 3 therefore the increased number of the investigated samples will result in less uncertainty in dealing with the estimated fractal dimensions as discussed before the calculated high ccs in fig 6 show that the porous soil structure is fractal and the fractal behavior must be observed in all pore intervals and the corresponding hydraulic properties the estimated permeability and hydraulic conductivities in table 3 acknowledge the aforementioned notion since the estimated permeability of each sample is close to the estimated permeabilities in each pore interval according to the provided data in table 4 the increase in fractal dimension d results in the increase of the tortuosity fractal dimension d t which in turn causes the decrease of permeability this was promising since the higher the tortuosity fractal dimension d t the more the tortuosity of the capillaries becomes as a result a higher resistance of flow transport in porous media is obtained which causes lower permeability and hydraulic conductivity also it can be observed that decreasing the pore intervals results in less permeability for the same soil sample however the alteration is negligible therefore the obtained results of pore interval p3 were considered as the estimated permeabilities of the soil samples since less computational effort is required for gaining the same results it can be seen that the calculated hydraulic conductivity of each sample was in the measured range of the saturated hydraulic conductivity indicated by laboratory experiments shown in table 1 the estimated hydraulic conductivities of the pore interval p3 were compared to the average values of the measured hydraulic conductivities for each sample shown in table 2 the relative errors of 0 7 2 and 2 8 were obtained for samples 1 2 and 3 respectively therefore the estimated hydraulic conductivities of all samples using fractal theory were in good agreement with the obtained hydraulic conductivities via the falling head experiment the implementation of fractal theory reduces the range of the estimated hydraulic conductivity for the soil material which provides a better view of the porous soil structure and water flow phenomenon as a result the proposed methodology for the estimation of saturated permeability and hydraulic conductivity with a more in depth view of the microstructure of the porous media can be considered an alternative alongside the actual measurements which are time consuming and expensive furthermore according to the probability density function with no restrictions in terms of pore size the proposed permeability model i e eq 2 provides more flexibility applicability and accuracy compared to other fractal models it has to be mentioned that the concept of representative elementary volume rev expresses that a sample must possess an adequate size to represent a specific physical property however in the early 1980 s by developing the concept of fractal geometry by mandelbrot 1982 it was theorized that fractal geometry of nature might cause natural objects e g soil show the same properties regardless of the level of observation hence it repudiates the rev concept since the fractal structure has irregular and convoluted geometries that are evident over various orders of resolution piccoli et al 2019 considering the outcomes of current research it was observed that the porous structure indicates high fractal behavior in all samples hence the resulted hydraulic conductivities were generalized for the whole soil sample moreover it is imperative to state that the self affine fractals are different from self similar fractals in a way that self affine fractals scale differently in various directions cousins et al 2018 in this study the fractal permeability model describes the self similarity of the porous environment and the self affinity of the soil is not considered the calculated saturated hydraulic conductivities were used in the next steps to estimate unsaturated hydraulic conductivities so that the saturated and unsaturated seepage analysis could be conducted 3 2 estimated unsaturated hydraulic conductivity according to the defined procedure in fig 3 b for estimating the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity first the swcc of the clay material must be determined for this purpose the given procedure in appendix b was employed using the available data of d 10 d 60 and ll as inputs of the seep w software according to east azerbaijan regional water department the values of d 10 d 60 and ll were reported to be 0 0031 mm 0 1665 mm and 28 respectively the generated results are shown as data points estimated value in fig 7 the required inputs for the unified fractal model are the fractal dimension d as well as the air entry value ψ a for the conventional models these parameters entail θ s θ r α n and m which indicate the saturated volumetric water content at saturation degree residual volumetric water content the inverse of air entry value pore distribution index and symmetry of the characteristic curve the conventional swcc models of van genuchten 1980 i e eq b 4 with both restrictions of m 1 2 n vgb and m 1 1 n vgm as well as the fractal swcc model of tao et al 2019 i e eq b 7 were fitted to the generated data points to derive the required parameters for estimating the relative hydraulic conductivity the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse are two metrics to evaluate the performance of the modeling fig 7 indicates the calculated r2 values for the fitted models also table 5 demonstrates the estimated parameters of the conventional vgb and vgm and fractal tao et al 2019 swcc models via the nonlinear least squares fitting procedure according to the presented r2 values in fig 7 and the provided rmse values in table 5 it is declared that the fractal swcc model of tao et al 2019 led to a slightly better performance than the conventional models of van genuchten 1980 with both restrictions vgb and vgm especially in the area near the air entry value furthermore the fractal swcc model reduced the number of required parameters to d and ψ a which have clear physical definitions and can be estimated using less time consuming approaches thus the fractal swcc model requires less computational effort in terms of application and can be used more conveniently the generated parameters of the conventional and fractal swcc models shown in table 5 were then used for estimating the relative hydraulic conductivities with the conventional models of vgb vgm i e eqs b 5 and b 6 and the unified fractal model i e eq b 8 according to the provided fractal dimension d 2 569 in table 5 and the specified ranges of fractal dimension in table b 1 the developed models of tao et al 2019 based on burdine 1953 tb and mualem 1976 tm models were chosen for estimating the relative hydraulic conductivities with the fractal perspective regarding table b 1 the generated parameters of table 5 and eqs b 5 b 6 b 8 the relative hydraulic conductivities of vgb vgm tb and tm were estimated as shown in fig 8 a as shown in fig 8 a the estimated relative hydraulic conductivities using the fractal models of tm and tb are almost identical therefore it can be concluded that the estimated seepage via the approximated tb and tm unsaturated hydraulic conductivities could result in the same value the mentioned perception might also be correct using the conventional models of vgb and vgm as the generated relative hydraulic conductivity curves are close to each other furthermore considering the estimated relative hydraulic conductivities provided in fig 8 a the value of the estimated unsaturated seepage by tm model might be higher than the estimated seepage using the other relative hydraulic conductivities since in the same matric suction the estimated tm relative hydraulic conductivity provides higher hydraulic conductivity than the models of tb vgb and vgm in the same manner the seepage values obtained by the tb model have to be higher than the seepage yielded by both vgb and vgm models according to the illustrated steps in fig 3 b the approximated relative hydraulic conductivities were used to estimate the unsaturated hydraulic conductivities considering eq b 3 in this way the generated relative hydraulic conductivities in fig 8 a were multiplied by the saturated hydraulic conductivities fig 8 b c d e and f depict the estimated unsaturated hydraulic conductivities using fractal and conventional models with different values for the saturated hydraulic conductivity fig 8 b c d e and f depict the estimated unsaturated hydraulic conductivities using fractal and conventional models with different values for the saturated hydraulic conductivity i e minimum maximum minimum fractal maximum fractal and average fractal for evaluating the influence of the quantity of saturated hydraulic conductivity on the unsaturated seepage analysis the minimum and maximum values of the saturated hydraulic conductivity in the measured range i e 10 8 and 1 2 10 7 m sec respectively were used for approximation of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity values also the estimated saturated hydraulic conductivities by the fractal notion and image processing technique i e minimum fractal maximum fractal and average fractal were used for the estimation of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity as well as can be seen in fig 8 the estimated unsaturated hydraulic conductivities using the conventional and fractal models are almost identical however the values of saturated hydraulic conductivities are different the estimated unsaturated hydraulic conductivities were utilized in the next step to conduct the unsaturated seepage analysis 3 3 results of the seepage analysis due to several uncertainties of laboratory experiments an upper and a lower limit for the hydraulic conductivity of materials are reported which have a direct impact on the amount of seepage fredlund et al 1994 the objective of this study is to indicate how the measured upper lower limit results in an over underestimation of the seepage value to conduct the seepage analysis of the gale chay dam at first the geometric model of the dam was constructed in seep w software for this purpose the indicated cross section no 2 in fig 2 was divided into quadratic elements with different mesh sizes however the 3 meter mesh size was chosen for the seepage analysis since negligible alterations were seen while reducing the mesh size and the seepage results converged later the material properties including the estimated hydraulic conductivities in the previous section were defined for various parts of the dam subsequently the boundary conditions were set as the upstream and downstream heads of 1670 and 1600 m respectively the estimated saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivities obtained via eqs 3 and b 3 respectively were utilized in this step to carry out the saturated and unsaturated seepage analysis furthermore to make a reasonable comparison of the effect of the fractal notion on the accuracy of the estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity and considering the measured hydraulic conductivity value of the core material in table 1 the minimum and maximum amounts i e 10 8 and 1 2 10 7 m sec respectively were utilized for employing the seepage analysis alongside the estimated fractal hydraulic conductivities for the saturated condition in a similar approach and to study the impact of the value of the saturated hydraulic conductivity on the unsaturated seepage analysis the mentioned minimum and maximum saturated hydraulic conductivities of the measured range were used for estimating the unsaturated hydraulic conductivities via both conventional and fractal models to see the upper and lower bonds of the estimations and modeling uncertainty according to the range of the measured hydraulic conductivity in the saturated condition for the core material and the estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity via fractal theory the saturated seepage analysis was conducted in this regard five values of the saturated hydraulic conductivity were utilized two of which were measured by laboratory experiments minimum 10 8 m sec and maximum 1 2 10 7 m sec and three of which were estimated by the image processing of the gathered samples maximum fractal 5 42 10 8 m sec minimum fractal 3 29 10 8 m sec and average fractal 4 20 10 8 m sec it is necessary to reiterate that the objective of this study is the application of the fractal hydraulic conductivity models in the seepage analysis of earth fill dams and the results might not be in good accordance with the observed seepage the estimated seepage values of both saturated and unsaturated conditions and the corresponding relative errors are presented in table 6 the calculated relative errors revealed that the maximum hydraulic conductivity obtained by laboratory experiments resulted in a 45 error in seepage estimation which is higher than the observed value therefore it can be noted that the application of the measured maximum hydraulic conductivity yields an uneconomical design with a high safety factor however the minimum value of hydraulic conductivity results in the least seepage that is lower than the observed value with a relative error of 11 6 hence the safety factor would be inferior and hazardous for the stability of the dam employing the estimated maximum fractal hydraulic conductivity in the saturated seepage analysis the relative error was reduced to 15 6 which led to an enhanced seepage estimation by approximately 65 compared to the resulting seepage in the case of utilizing the maximum hydraulic conductivity therefore in terms of economic aspects the implication of maximum fractal hydraulic conductivity is more reliable than the measured maximum hydraulic conductivity the minimum fractal hydraulic conductivity provided an error of 8 in saturated seepage analysis which was a preferable choice considering the safety factor in comparison to the corresponding minimum hydraulic conductivity as indicated in table 1 also the minimum fractal hydraulic conductivity improved the accuracy of the seepage analysis with a ratio of almost 49 compared to when the maximum fractal hydraulic conductivity was used for the modeling considering the average fractal hydraulic conductivity the estimated seepage was observed to present a relative error of 10 8 which is more reliable than the cases of implementing the minimum and maximum hydraulic conductivities of the measured range however compared to the estimated minimum fractal hydraulic conductivity the accuracy of the seepage analysis was diminished by 35 which in turn could yield a higher safety factor for the dam design the core material of the dam is considered to be in the unsaturated condition to achieve more realistic seepage modeling later the unsaturated seepage analysis was conducted considering twenty developed unsaturated hydraulic conductivities of the conventional vgb and vgm and fractal tb and tm models considering five saturated hydraulic conductivities the results of the unsaturated seepage estimation are presented in table 6 alongside the calculated relative errors derived from the comparison of the estimated and observed seepage values the phreatic line estimated water head and flow paths of the saturated and unsaturated seepage analysis are illustrated in fig 9 since the average fractal hydraulic conductivity resulted in the most accurate seepage estimations in both saturated and unsaturated conditions the illustrated phreatic surfaces in fig 9 are related to the ones obtained from the average fractal hydraulic conductivity as shown in fig 9 the estimated phreatic lines obtained via different hydraulic conductivity models are almost identical it is important to mention that the water level of the installed piezometers alter during the time hence in this study the estimated seepages were directly compared with observed value however in order to have a better view of the water flow through the dam the results of physical base model i e fem were compared with the observed water heads in different piezometers indicate in fig 2 then for each model the relative errors were calculated see table 7 considering the provided relative errors in table 7 the fem model using the unsaturated notion led to higher accuracy than the saturated condition this was promising since the unsaturated condition considers the existing suction in water flow phenomenon which is close to reality considering estimated the water levels in piezometer number 207 213 the fem model could make acceptable estimations in both saturated and unsaturated conditions however in piezometers number 214 217 the unsaturated assumption outperforms the saturated condition this issue can be seen in fig 9 since the estimated water levels for the unsaturated condition are closer to the observed values the indicated phreatic surfaces of unsaturated condition in fig 9 are more reliable according to the given relative errors in table 6 it can be declared that in general the application of the unsaturated condition led to lower seepage values compared to the saturated case considering the mentioned point it could be concluded that the maximum hydraulic conductivity yielded optimized seepage estimation by an average of 28 employing the unsaturated conventional and fractal models compared to its corresponding saturated condition however according to the high relative errors obtained from the unsaturated seepage analysis the implementation of the maximum hydraulic conductivity led to an over designed condition the minimum hydraulic conductivity resulted in lower estimated seepage values by both conventional and fractal models compared to the parallel analysis carried out with the maximum hydraulic conductivity additionally the measured minimum hydraulic conductivity deteriorated the unsaturated seepage analysis by an average of 74 compared to its corresponding saturated analysis consequently it could be denoted that the implication of the minimum hydraulic conductivity led to a more perilous design in the unsaturated condition considering the maximum fractal hydraulic conductivity the unsaturated soil state led to an enhanced seepage analysis by an average of 49 compared to its saturated notion also the application of the maximum fractal hydraulic conductivity improved the accuracy of the unsaturated seepage analysis by an average of 72 in comparison to the case of using the maximum hydraulic conductivity by both conventional and fractal models the minimum fractal hydraulic conductivity yielded seepage values less than the observed amount in all cases which led to negative relative errors however the unsaturated seepage analysis using the estimated minimum fractal hydraulic conductivity was improved with an average of 89 in comparison to the unsaturated analysis conducted by the measured minimum hydraulic conductivity via both conventional and fractal models the estimated average fractal hydraulic conductivity presented the most accurate seepage analysis in the unsaturated condition which enhanced the precision of the analysis by an average of 80 compared to the corresponding saturated condition considering the presented relative errors in table 6 it can be denoted that the computed seepage values by the fractal models of tb and tm provided slightly higher approximations than the commonly used models of vgb and vgm for all conditions as a result it can be concluded that the unified fractal model can be considered a proper alternative for estimating unsaturated hydraulic conductivity moreover since the existing parameters of the unsaturated fractal models possess physical definitions the fractal dimension d as a parameter defining the complexity of the porous structure and the air entry value ψ a which is related to the maximum pore diameter these models present a more in depth understanding of the soil texture and water flow through the porous media also the mentioned parameters can be estimated using less expensive and less time consuming approaches such as mip test and image processing which makes the application of the unsaturated fractal models more convenient in practice compared to the conventional models as was discussed priorly the purpose of this study was the implementation of fractal hydraulic conductivity in seepage analysis of earth fill dams the results showed that the fractal models could be considered potential tools in seepage estimation the mentioned point is for the reason that classic methods of hydraulic conductivity estimation consider the porosity of the soil medium solely however using the fractal theory the distribution of the voids can be assessed as well furthermore it was observed that using the fractal theory a reliable prediction interval of seepage analysis was obtained compared to the prediction interval resulting from the measured hydraulic conductivity by the laboratory experiments which again highlights the prominence of the distribution of complexities pores in this case using the fractal dimension d 4 conclusions in this paper the seepage analysis of gale chay dam was carried out using fem considering both saturated and unsaturated conditions for the core material a novel approach via fractal theory was used for describing the porous media and estimating the hydraulic conductivities in saturated and unsaturated conditions considering the saturated state the gathered soil samples were analyzed using the image processing technique and the fractal permeability model was employed to estimate the saturated hydraulic conductivity it was concluded that the gathered samples had almost the same porosity with different distributions of pores indicated by the fractal dimension the saturated seepage analysis of the dam was conducted using five hydraulic conductivities of the maximum minimum maximum fractal minimum fractal and average fractal the estimated seepage results indicated that the maximum and minimum hydraulic conductivities eventuated uneconomical and unsafe designs respectively however the estimated fractal hydraulic conductivities provided safer and more economical designs with reasonable relative error values in seepage analysis hence it was concluded that considering the pore size distribution by the fractal theory presented a more exact estimation of the hydraulic conductivity that can be implemented alongside the actual measurement to gain a more detailed understanding of the porous media for a better seepage estimation the unsaturated seepage analysis was conducted employing the conventional and novel unsaturated fractal hydraulic conductivity models considering eq b 3 the saturated hydraulic conductivities as well as the estimated relative hydraulic conductivities with conventional and fractal models twenty unsaturated hydraulic conductivities were generated the obtained results of the seepage analysis indicated that the unsaturated soil state reduced the value of estimated seepage using all twenty models moreover it was observed that the unsaturated seepage analysis is highly affected by the value of the saturated hydraulic conductivity the generated unsaturated models by the estimated saturated fractal hydraulic conductivities resulted in improved seepage analysis compared to the developed models with the maximum and minimum hydraulic conductivities measured in the laboratory moreover it was concluded that the implementation of the estimated average fractal hydraulic conductivity for the approximation of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivities with both conventional and fractal models resulted in a more accurate seepage analysis by an average of 80 compared to its corresponding saturated seepage analysis additionally considering the fractal models of tb and tm the seepage estimations were close to the results gained by the conventional models of vgb and vgm hence it was concluded that the unsaturated fractal models could be used as viable alternatives in unsaturated seepage analysis since these models possess parameters that can be estimated more conveniently with less computational effort based on the provided results of this research to design and employ the seepage analysis of earth fill dams it is recommended to calculate and report the fractal dimension d of the soil porous structure alongside the measured porosity of the soil sample this is due to the fact that the permeability and hydraulic conductivity of the porous medium depend not only on the porosity but also on the distribution of the pores in that porous media which can be defined by the concept of fractal dimension for future studies physically based dam models can be constructed and the measured seepage can be compared with the 3d numerical simulations in this way the proposed methodology of this study can be applied to further investigate the merits of fractal theory in seepage analysis also to estimate the fractal dimension of the samples other methods such as the mip experiment and image processing of the 3d computed tomography ct images can be applied the application of the mentioned experiments on soil samples would provide a more realistic understanding of the soil structure as the existing pores contain a volume of the environment also the soil volume change hysteresis of swcc and advanced numerical algorithms can be considered in future studies to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the soil hydraulic properties and water flow through porous environment credit authorship contribution statement vahid
