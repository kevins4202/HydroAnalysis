5175,floods are one of the most widespread natural hazards occurring across the globe the main objective of this study was to produce flood susceptibility maps for the province of salzburg austria using two multi criteria decision analysis mcda models including analytical hierarchical process ahp and analytical network process anp and two machine learning ml models including random forest rf and support vector machine svm additionally we compare which of the mcda and ml models are better suited for flood susceptibility and evaluate the use of dempster shafer theory dst for optimising the resulting flood susceptibility maps based on eleven flood conditioning factors elevation slope aspect topographic wetness index twi stream power index spi normalised difference vegetation index ndvi geology rainfall land cover distance to roads and distance to drainage the accuracy evaluation of the flood susceptibility maps through the auc area under the receiver operating characteristic curve method along with the relative flood density r index shows that rf auc 87 8 and svm auc 87 outperform the anp auc 86 6 and ahp auc 85 9 models therefore the predictive performance of ml models was slightly better than the mcda models the dst could further increase the accuracy of both ml models auc 88 3 and mcda models auc 87 3 however the best accuracy auc 89 3 is reached through an ensemble of all four models keywords flood susceptibility dempster shafer theory dst random forest rf support vector machine svm analytical hierarchical process ahp analytical network process anp 1 introduction water is an indispensable resource influencing our economy and our way of life across the globe water has become an essential topic of dialogue floods are one of the utmost frequently occurring natural hazards in the world floods are natural phenomena that occur after a long duration of precipitation heavy rainfalls or snowmelt in combination with unfavourable conditions and flooding is one of the most destructive natural disaster occurring around the world kalantari et al 2019 in the recent decade flooding seems to be occurring quite frequently and this is due to the increase in environmental degradation such as population growth deforestation urbanisation and so on wang et al 2019 flooding occurs when a natural or modified system for drainage is not able to contain the water floods turn to risk when it affects people infrastructure and settlements the higher the risk of frequency in flooding the higher the potential damages flooding can cause severe damages to many aspects like economy human lives transportation ecological ecosystem infrastructures and cultural heritage sites yu et al 2013 flooding is the critical natural hazard where the exposure of its damage is not quantifiable rozalis et al 2010 climate change combined with socioeconomic development has a direct impact on floods and these factors will increase the risk of flooding in future and placing the community in danger kalantari et al 2014 globally the occurrence of floods has amplified by 40 over the last two decades hirabayashi et al 2013 analysis of flooding is quite vital for socioeconomic and environmental consequences markantonis et al 2013 flood susceptibility is a crucial task for emergency preparedness and management strategies on prevention and mitigation of floods sachdeva et al 2017 communities and infrastructures neighbouring to the rivers are the most exposed areas to the impact and effects of flooding jung et al 2011 the number of people living in the flood risk zone was estimated to be around 1 3 billion by 2050 ligtvoet et al 1991 austria is a country surrounded by land in central europe with a surface area of 83 879 km2 and a population of 8 7 million gudiyangada nachappa et al 2019 owing to the location in the alpine range and its climatic environments austria is at significant risk from natural hazards while many alpine areas in austria are susceptible to gravitational hazards like landslides debris flow and avalanches flooding affects the low lying areas of the country about 13 of all the buildings in austria are located in flooding areas and 1 million residents in austria live in flood prone areas fuchs et al 2015 austria experienced a series of large scale flooding along the danube and its tributaries in 2002 2005 2006 and 2013 fuchs et al 2012 annual daily precipitation is expected to increase over the years in many areas increasing the probability of severe floods in the alps gobiet et al 2014 kundzewicz et al 2010 geographic information system gis and remote sensing has been used as a useful tool for spatial analysis in hazard assessment ghorbanzadeh et al 2019c flood susceptibility analysis is the primary process to predict and mitigate the future occurrences of flooding kourgialas and karatzas 2011 flood susceptibility analysis has been carried out using various statistical models and probabilistic models levy 2007 natural disasters have been studied using various models like frequency ratio fr rahmati et al 2015a analytical hierarchical process ahp rahmati et al 2015b analytical network process anp pirnazar et al 2017 support vector machines svm tehrany et al 2015a random forest rf chapi et al 2017 evidence belief function ebf nampak et al 2014 dempster shafer mohammady et al 2012 pourghasemi et al 2013 decision tree tehrany et al 2013 logistic regression lr felicísimo et al 2013 pradhan et al 2008 artificial neural networks ann ghorbanzadeh et al 2019a recently machine learning ml methods have been applied for natural hazard assessments like landslides floods and wildfires ghorbanzadeh et al 2019c jaafari et al 2019 tien bui et al 2019 any model used for assessments has advantages and disadvantages each model performance is centred on the data used accuracy and the structure besides there is no evidence that a particular model should be used for a particular scenario or study area khosravi et al 2018 in this research we use data based two new machine learning techniques such as svm rf and compare this against knowledge based commonly used multi criteria decision analysis models like ahp and anp for identifying flood prone areas and producing flood susceptibility maps in a recent study machine learning techniques like naïve bayes and naïve bayes tree were compared with multi criteria decision technique like vikor topsis and saw this study showed that ml has a higher prediction power compared to expert based mcda khosravi et al 2019 also evidence belief function ebf and ensemble techniques was applied for flood susceptibility analysis and compared it with topsis cart vikor and fr techniques where ebf model had higher accuracy arabameri et al 2019 chowdhuri et al 2020 mosavi et al 2018 advanced ml methods like feature selection simulate annealing with resampling algorithms were also used for flood susceptibility mapping hosseini et al 2020 all these ml and mcda methods are powerful however they are sensitive to some issues and exhibits a certain amount of weakness or uncertainties in the case of ml methods as the models are trained they are prone to the overlearning and the selection of the number of epochs in the training process may influence the results also the input data used for ml are typically specified to take a wide range of values while their output results in limited ranges however knowledge based mcda models have shown acceptable generic hazard mapping results where there is no access to a suitable inventory even though knowledge based methods have shown to have acceptable mapping it has been shown that uncertainty is connected with such methods that lead to inaccurate results ghorbanzadeh et al 2018b ghorbanzadeh et al 2018c dempster shafer theory dst which is also mentioned as evidence theory is principally based on representing independent sections of evidence by totally monotone capacities also known as belief functions and pooling them through a standard operator called dempster s rule of combination yager and liu 2008 this method has been used for various natural hazard assessments and we will use dempster shafer theory dst to optimise the results for both ml and mcda categories to optimise the results and reduce the uncertainty of the models the main drive and novelty of this research except comparing the various ml and mcda models for producing the flood susceptibility maps for the province of salzburg for the first time the ensemble using dempster shafer model for optimising the resulting susceptibility maps 2 study area theprovince of salzburg is a state in austria see fig 1 and the city of salzburg is the capital of the province of salzburg the total population of the province of salzburg is around 531 000 and has a density around 74 km2 the total area covered is 7156 03 km2 and the city of salzburg is the capital and the central city province of salzburg stretches along its primary river the salzach running from the central eastern alps in the south with an altitude of 3657 m above sea level the province of salzburg is situated along its primary river the salzach close to the border of germany salzach s drainage basin of 6829 km2 includes large parts of the northern limestone and the central eastern alps around 83 of the salzach basin lies in austria and the remainder in germany majority of the salzach basin is situated in the province of salzburg salzach basin experienced a series of large scale flooding along the danube and its tributaries in 2002 2005 2006 and 2013 fuchs et al 2012 annual daily precipitation is expected to increase over the years in many areas increasing the probability of severe floods in the alps gobiet et al 2014 kundzewicz et al 2010 the area is very dynamic in regard to it s economic and growths gudiyangada et al 2020 3 data 3 1 flood inventory map to predict the occurrences of future floods it is vital to analyse the occurrence of historical flooding events as the historical event data has a strong correlation with future predictive flooding khosravi et al 2016 for this research the flood inventory map was prepared based on the hochwasserrisikozonierung flood risk zoning hora flood data 30hq with polygon coverage and randomised locations were derived for each polygon based on the data the flood inventory was then categorised into training 70 and validation 30 randomly see fig 1 3 2 flood conditioning factors it is decisive to regulate the causative factors for the hazard in preparing for any of the natural hazard susceptibility mapping rahmati et al 2015a floods have interconnected causes or factors that are known as conditioning factors pourghasemi et al 2013 for this study eleven conditioning factors were used based on the study area and data availability the factors were elevation slope aspect topographic wetness index twi stream power index spi distance to drainage geology distance to roads rainfall ndvi and landcover see fig 2 these flood conditioning factors are differentiated into four different classes topographical hydrological environmental and anthropological see table 1 the digital elevation model dem data were downloaded from land salzburg with the resolution of 30 m for province of salzburg and secondary data like slope and aspect was derived from dem water related factors such as topographic wetness index twi and stream power index spi was derived from the dem geology and distance to drainage data were obtained from the geological survey of austria gba rainfall data was downloaded from öks15 from the ccca data centre for the province of salzburg normalised difference vegetation index ndvi was downloaded from land viewer eos and landcover data was obtained from the land information system austria lisa 3 2 1 topographical conditioning factors the elevation is an essential factor in flood susceptibility analysis rahmati et al 2015b the elevation defines the lowest and the highest point range in the region elevation can also influence the topographic factors and vegetation distribution khosravi et al 2016 the elevation was classified into five classes 0 500 m 500 1000 m 1000 1500 m 1500 2000 m and 2000 m above mean sea level in the alpine region vegetation fluctuations are witnessed as the elevation rises the slope is crucial in flood susceptibility as this regulates the surface runoff velocity and vertical percolation that affects the flood susceptibility the slope is measured as the surface indicator for flood susceptibility youssef et al 2011 the slope was classified into five classes from 0 to 40 by intervals of 10 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 and 40 aspect is an essential factor for flood susceptibility analysis aspect describes the direction of the slope we classified province of salzburg s slope aspect into ten classes north 0 22 5 337 5 360 northeast 22 5 67 5 east 67 5 112 5 southeast 112 5 157 5 south 157 5 202 5 southwest 202 5 247 5 west 247 5 292 5 northwest 292 5 337 5 north 337 5 360 and flat 0 twi is the accumulation of flow at any location in the catchment with consideration of downstream flow trends due to gravity gokceoglu et al 2005 the eq 1 to calculate twi beven and kirkby 1979 moore et al 1991 is twi l n α t a n β where α is the cumulative upslope area draining through a point per unit contour length and tan β is the slope angle in degrees at that point whereas the stream power index spi is the power of water flow in terms of erosion moore et al give the eq 2 to calculate spi moore et al 1991 spi α t a n β where α is the specific area of the catchment in m2 m of the catchment and tan β is the slope angle in degrees at that point 3 2 2 hydrological conditioning factors distance to drainage is one of the primary conditioning factors in flood susceptibility this factor has a significant impact on the spread of the flooding along with the magnitude tien bui et al 2019 the study area was categorised into five classes the classes were created for intervals of 0 250 m 250 500 m 500 750 m 750 1000 m and 1000 m rainfall is one of the vital triggering aspects of flooding wu et al 2016 rainfall characteristics vary by weather conditions and topographical characteristics and this causes considerable temporal and spatial differences in a rainfall event annual average precipitation for salzburg province was classified into four classes 0 1000 mm 1000 1500 mm 1500 2000 mm and 2000 mm 3 2 3 environmental conditioning factors geology plays a significant role in flood susceptibility owing to sensitivity to lithological units areas which have higher permeable soil and hard resistance rocks tend to have low channel densities wang et al 2019 we have six geological units in our study area mainly helvetic nappes austroalpine nappes penninic nappes molasse zone sub penninic nappes and water landcover can be used to explain the highly dissected zones within the region mohammadi et a 2019 land use is one of the vital conditioning factors for flood susceptibility assessments the landcover for the province of salzburg are classified as built up flat sealed surfaces permanent soil bare rock screes water snow ice trees bushes shrubs herbaceous and reeds the normalised difference vegetation index ndvi layer is a crucial factor in flood susceptibility and was derived from satellite image available at land viewer eos from 2019 this layer shows the vegetation coverage of the area the vegetation index value ranges from 1 to 1 the ndvi values were calculated using eq 4 shahabi et al 2012 ndvi nir v i s nir v i s where nir is the spectral reflectance measured in the infrared bands of the electromagnetic spectrum and vis is the spectral reflectance in the red band of the electromagnetic spectrum 3 2 4 anthropological conditioning factors roads are regarded as one of the most critical anthropogenic factors influencing the flooding kalantari et al 2014 the study area was categorised into five different classes which nominated the influence of flooding caused by roads the interval of buffer zones was 0 200 m 200 400 m 400 600 m 600 800 m and 800 m all the conditioning factors were classified into 30 m cell size resolution for flood susceptibility analysis 4 methods models 4 1 multi criteria decision analysis mcda a common approach to decipher spatially related problems along with natural hazard assessments is using multi criteria decision analysis mcda this approach provides a geospatial framework to manage diverse conditioning factors or thematic layers into a hierarchical configuration and evaluate the relations between the components duleba and moslem 2019 gis centred multi criteria decision analysis mcda is a robust modelling approach in spatial sciences gis and mcda have been conclusively linked to resolving a diversity of spatially linked problems ghorbanzadeh et al 2018b the gis mcda approach combines data resulting from several geographical aspects into a single index of assessment gis mcda forms a framework that manages diverse modules of the spatial decision problem and can be used for assessing the interactions between numerous components in multifaceted problems gis based mcda gis mcda offers an intelligent spatial planning method for identifying the relative importance of conditioning factors the capabilities of gis combined with mcda have solved a wide range of spatial problems analytical hierarchical process ahp and analytic network process anp are the commonly used mcda methods shahabi et al 2014 the ahp is the most common gis mcda approaches that have been used for deriving the criteria weights for modelling tasks whereas anp was developed in the context of network approaches in order to minimize the errors involved in traditional ahp approach ahp anp has been used for flood susceptibility analysis by various studies using expert knowledge 4 1 1 analytical hierarchy process ahp ahp is one of the most generally used models in gis mcda methodologies shahabi et al 2014 this model supports the weighting process based on expert s knowledge that is organized in pairwise comparison matrices ahp is a simple decision making tool to deal with complex unstructured and multi attribute problems saaty 1980 ahp model has been extensively applied in several natural hazard assessments like landslides wildfire floods and earthquakes ghorbanzadeh et al 2018d this model is centred on multi criteria and multiple objectives and includes the contribution from the experts on their expert knowledge and judgement in depth knowledge of experts plays a critical role in formulating valuable pairwise comparison matrices pcm moslem et al 2019 theoretically pcm is reciprocal consistent and quadratic and the ahp utilises these unique characteristics of pcm however in the ahp process the experts most of the times do not evaluate the pcm consistently this can be checked using the eigenvector method where this checks if experts have carried out the consistency check for the evaluations for the evaluation by the experts an underlying scale is proposed for pairwise comparisons in the ahp model where values range from 1 to 9 this ranking has been provided in table 1 the expert assigns the value for each factor and each factor class weight from the matrix class is multiplied by the weight class the main important in ahp is the principle of transitivity for any of the three factors such as f1 f2 and f3 and this is defined as if f1 f2 and f2 f3 then f1 f3 the main base for conditioning factor weightings in ahp is the principle of transitivity owing to this principle of transitivity a consistent pairwise comparison matrix would require that if 2f1 f2 i e f1 is two times more preferable than f2 and 4f2 f3 then 8f1 f3 to account for the transitivity principle later consistency permanently must be checked during the ahp process and this can be achieved by using consistency index ci and the consistency ratio cr ghorbanzadeh et al 2018a ci is calculated using the eq 5 ci λ max n n 1 where ci is the consistency index λ max is the maximum eigenvalue and n is the number of rows in the matrix cr can be calculated by using the eq 6 cr ci ri where ci is the consistent index and ri is the random index for the randomly created pairwise comparison matrix where n 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 if the cr is 0 10 it indicates a suitable level of consistency whereas a cr 0 10 indicates an inappropriate level of consistency ghorbanzadeh et al 2018c table 2 shows the consistency index ci for a randomly generated matrix 4 1 2 analytical network process anp the analytical network process is broadly used to derive criteria weightings in modelling analysis and most frequently used gis mcda technique ghorbanzadeh et al 2017 this is a variation of the analytical hierarchical process which was established for network methods to reduce the errors in the traditional ahp this anp method entails experts with comprehensive knowledge in the domain in order to create the pairwise comparison matrix pcm in an effective and reliable manner an anp model offers a logical way of dealing with dependence and can resolve complex issues with interdependent relationships as anp is built on mathematical theory this can help in overcoming all different types of dependencies the pcm can be derived using the pairwise comparison matrix provided in the table 1 on a scale of 1 9 going from equal significance of factors to extreme supremacy of one factor over another saaty 1980 the anp builds a network that contains small to large matrices of elements and probable substitutes that are congregated into clusters these elements can be intertwined in any number of conceivable ways within the network the network comprises feedback and interdependence connections within and between the clusters aragonés beltrán et al 2008 the component of supermatrix is given below in the formula w w i 1 j 1 w i 2 j 1 w i n i j 1 w i 1 j 2 w i 2 j 2 w i n i j 2 w i 1 j n j w i 2 j n j w i n i j n j the priority of each pairwise comparison matrix is calculated separately the results of all individual pairwise comparison matrices are collected into an overall supermatrix in order to assess the final weightings of the elements saaty 1980 the supermatrix w illustrates the influence of each element on other elements within the network system the anp includes small to large matrices of criteria and probable substitutes to form a network which is assembled into clusters these substitutes or alternatives can be intertwined in numerous likely means within the network and this network contains interdependence connections and feedbacks within and between clusters ghorbanzadeh et al 2018b for the evaluation by the experts an underlying scale is proposed for pairwise comparisons in the ahp model where values range from 1 to 9 this ranking has been provided in table 1 the cluster matrix for anp is shown in table 4 that has the factors classified into topographical hydrological environmental and anthropological 4 2 machine learning models machine learning techniques have contributed greatly during the previous few years in the progression of prediction systems providing improved performance and economical solutions ghorbanzadeh et al 2018e ghorbanzadeh et al 2019a the constant progress of ml approaches over the last few years established their appropriateness for flood predicting with an adequate rate of overtaking conservative methods ml approaches are data driven models that can mathematically express flood nonlinearity constructed on previous data without needing the understanding of the fundamental physical process khosravi et al 2019 ml is independent of expert knowledge but it entirely depends strongly on the inventory data ml models have been used for various hazard assessments and producing susceptibility maps for wildfire and landslides gholamnia et al 2020 for this study we have used support vector machines svm and random forest rf as two machine learning methods for flood susceptibility and used google earth engine for the ml analysis 4 2 1 support vector machines svm support vector machine is a data mining machine learning method universally used with a set of linear indicator functions which is used for the issues function estimations vapnik 2013 svm is also known as the maximum margin method which can provide higher performance and better results with limited data points mohammadi et al 2019 svm is grounded on statistical learning theory that maps the dataset into a high dimensional feature space through nonlinear transformers to create the best hyperplane kavzoglu et al 2013 the best hyperplane can be obtained when separating margins between the defined classes of the problem are maximal svms are unidirectional and have two layers that can implement diverse activation functions like linear polynomial radial or sigmoid the performance of the svm model is influenced by the kernel functions like linear polynomial sigmoid and radial basis function rbf bui et al 2016 four kernel categories were used for this svm approach to understand the efficiency of classification and susceptibility mapping along with the type as string 4 2 2 random forest rf random forest rf algorithm was first created using the random subspace method ho 1995 random forest rf is a machine learning technique where the input dataset is classified based on the ensemble of multiple decision trees rf has received growing attention in recent years due to its ability to produce excellent classification results along with the processing speed du et al 2015 additionally a random set of features are selected at each stage when forecasting output and each of the output is weighted by the value derived from the votes that it obtains the majority vote based on the outputs of assessed decision trees converge in a single decision tree for the final classification ghorbanzadeh et al 2019b xu et al 2018 to overcome the uncertainty problem use a single decision tree and this will result in higher prediction accuracy valdez et al 2017 the crucial step in the rf classification is to derive high variance from different decision trees rf is considered one of the key operative non parametric ensemble learning methods in susceptibility mapping the key training possibilities in the rf model is the usage of maximum number of trees the variable number which is required in the split search and the variant of sampling process tavakkoli piralilou et al 2019 the first and the second training options are considered in split searching of the rf the usage of maximum number of trees were set to 500 for this analysis 4 2 3 dempster shafer theory dst the dst was suggested by dempster and extended by shafer dempster 1967 shafer 1976 dst is a generalisation of bayesian methodology which permits for a general level of uncertainty and offers a means to account explicitly for the unidentified possible cause of observational data hall 1996 dst utilises belief uncertainty intervals based on evidence of multiple observations to present the belief of assumptions feizizadeh 2018 dst is a precision fusion algorithm that exploits probability driven pieces of evidence reasoning and weight enclosed within the dataset dst is an efficient and time effective substitute that decreases the amount of time required to select training sites kabolizade et al 2010 tavakkoli piralilou et al 2019 dst model has been applied in remote sensing applications like landslide susceptibility mapping mohammady et al 2012 groundwater assessment nampak et al 2014 moreover the dst is well known as evidence theory which defines basic probability assignments bpa function to provide the combination of evidence martin et al 2010 it defines hypotheses in a hierarchical structure developed from a basic set of hypotheses that form the frame of discernment eastman 2012 the dst is an effective method for modelling imprecision and uncertainty assessment and it can provide additional flexibility for the specification of uncertainty in probabilistic models and hypothesis testing the dst has mostly focused on uncertain reasoning in artificial intelligence and expert systems in this theory displaying information requires two essential functions which are named bel and plausibility function pl which derives the lower bound value for a known probability function and the upper bound for a probability function an unknown probability function respectively the differentiation between bel and pl illustrates the uncertainty of the knowledge about the objective proposition fig 3 shows the schematic of dst combinations the dst provides an extension of the probability framework for assessing the uncertainty of any imprecision event of the probability p ml that the alternative method ml l 1 n be correct the lower bound indicates the degree of knowledge or belief that supports ml and represents by bel ml whereas the upper bound donates to the fact of ml and called plausibility pl ml baraldi and zio 2010 see the eqs 10 and 11 10 bel a b a m b 11 pl a b a 0 m b where the summation is engaged over all sets b 2 ɵ with b a in the definition of bel and the summation in that of pl is taken over all b 2 ɵ with b a 0 which the set of ɵ is mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive hypotheses and the power set of ɵ is denoted by 2ɵ the bel is the summation of all masses directly assigned to that by a set of hypothesis a while the plausibility sums all masses not assigned to the complement of the hypothesis a an uncertainty interval is defined as if b e l a p l a that has the following properties b e l a p l a p l a 1 b e l a where ā is the negation of a and bel ā is called the disbelief function these properties indicate that the unknown true probability lies somewhere between the belief and plausibility functions the difference between these two functions which is called the belief interval or ignorance represents the ignorance of one s belief of the target proposition a and can be regarded as a measure of the imprecision of knowledge about the uncertainty of set of a rottensteiner et al 2005 this belief interval or ignorance is the main distinguishing feature of the dst of evidence compared to the traditional probability theory from the general point of view unlike a probabilistic theory that allocates a mass to the individual elementary events the theory of evidence or the bpa makes m a on the set a of the p z power sets of space z event i e on a set of results rather than a single elementary event 4 3 accuracy assessment 4 3 1 receiver operating characteristic roc validation is a significant step in evaluating the accuracy of each model validation of the results specifies the superiority of the models arabameri et al 2019 we used receiver operating characteristic roc for accuracy assessment of the models in this study area the area under the curve auc was used for the evaluation and quantitative comparison of the methods used for flood susceptibility mapping for the validation we have used 70 of the inventory for model training and 30 of the inventory for model validation training and validation datasets were selected based on the size of the study area inventory data and the applied methodology the receiver operating characteristic curve roc is a broadly used standard procedure to define the performance of the models specifically in spatial modelling chen et al 2017 4 3 2 relative flood density r index the accuracy of flood susceptibility mapping is also evaluated using the index of relative flood density r index we used the testing landslide points for validating the susceptibility maps the equation for r index is given as r ni ni σ ni ni 100 where ni is the percentage of the area that is susceptible to flooding in each susceptibility class and ni is the percentage of flood locations in each susceptibility class fig 4 shows the overall workflow of the applied methodology including the mcda ml and dst approaches for flood susceptibility mapping the mcda analysis was carried out using matlab and the ml analysis was carried out in google earth engine the processing of the conditioning factors and preparing the final classified susceptibility maps were prepared using arcgis 10 software 5 results 5 1 multi criteria decision analysis mcda the mcda results were derived using the expert based pairwise comparison matrix and final flood susceptibility mapping was derived using weighted overlay methodology see table 5 and 6 the ahp and anp weights were generated through expert knowledge through pairwise comparison matrices there is no standard method for the classification of the resulting susceptibility maps all the results were normalised to values between 0 and 100 for consistency and comparison the results were classified into five classes of very low low moderate high and very high susceptibility levels using quantile classification method that distributes the values into groups that contain an equal number of values this is better than the commonly used natural breaks where some classes might have limited or excessive number of values see fig 5 5 2 machine learning ml the flood susceptibility maps of the study area generated by two ml models show the same overall spatial pattern with high flood susceptibility in the northern and central parts of the study area fig 6 however the spatial detail of each model also differs that came from their modelling structures 5 3 dempster shafer optimisation the dst was used for grouping mcda approaches like ahp anp and ml techniques like rf and svm using the fusion level analysis technique mezaal et al 2018 and fused into a class of flood areas based on dst we fused both the mcda techniques as well as both the ml techniques to derive dst optimised mcda and ml susceptibility map along with the entire four techniques combined susceptibility map fig 7 in the inventory dataset the location of flooding is modified as the corresponding pixels hence for the dst process the inventory data is considered as the polygons of each pixel however the resulting fusion for mcda and ml are not classified into different susceptibility classes thus we chose quantile classification schema to classify the resulting fusion susceptibility maps into five classes namely very high high moderate low and very low for the application of dst these categories were then converted into two classes of one and zero the classes of one refer to high and very high whereas zero refers to very low low and moderate susceptibility classes therefore all the four output susceptibility maps from ahp anp rf and svm was converted into a binary map of one and zero several bels were combined in the dst within the same frame that makes it possible to harmonies the flood susceptible fs areas from these techniques the probability of uncertainty in the fs areas can be derived from bel and pl therefore the resulted fs areas of four outputs ahp anp were combined by fusing the dst with only the training inventory dataset the accuracy of the flood areas based on each technique was assessed using a confusion matrix and accordingly the bels were estimated by a precision function mezaal et al 2018 the dst combined the majority of fs areas which are closer to the inventory dataset and then assigned them into the class of flood area based on the dst the resulting flood susceptibility maps are based on the dst that is converted into the same five classes using the quantile classification technique 6 model validation as already mentioned 30 of the inventory data were not used for training the models and considered as the validation data therefore the resulting maps were compared with the validation data to find the performance of each model the roc curves are used for validating the resulting maps with the validation dataset to determine the accuracy of the model see figs 8 and 9 this vertical axis of the curve represents the true positives tp and the horizontal axis represents the false positives fp of the curve this validation shows the tradeoff between tps and fps ghorbanzadeh et al 2018e tps are the pixels that are correctly labelled as susceptible to flood and fps are the pixels that incorrectly labelled as susceptible to flood roc obtains the tps and fps of every pixel in the validation dataset and then plots tps vs fps across the range of values ghorbanzadeh et al 2018a the area under the curve auc is a measurement that represents the accuracy of the results of each prediction models the auc specifies the probability that the value of a correctly labelled pixel will surpass the value of an incorrectly labelled pixel the higher the auc values the higher the accuracy of the model and vice versa auc value close to 1 represents a perfect model with the highest accuracy and auc value equal to or 0 5 indicates that the model is not worthy for the analysis there are no standard comparison results for the values of auc however there are some studies which employed intervals with linguistic measurements baird 2013 the table 3 shows the auc intervals with measurements see table 7 the relative flood density r index was used to assess the accuracy of flood susceptibility maps table 8 and fig 10 show the r index for each of the models and the corresponding area for each susceptibility class respectively 7 discussion modelling and simulation systems are valuable decision support tools to expand the knowledge of flood hazard management however the structure and nature of modelling approaches vary considerably resulting in different predictive performance and outputs importantly the availability of different modelling approaches enables decision makers to develop and implement efficient environmental plans hill and minsker 2010 on the other hand different models have been separately used in different regions for example in order to produce a flood susceptibility map tehrany et al 2015a used svm for flood susceptibility mapping in kuala terengganu basin malaysia rahmati and pourghasemi 2017 used rf model in golestan watershed iran and stefanidis and stathis 2013 applied ahp in kassandra peninsula greece thus comparative studies are needed to evaluate the performance of models in the same conditions and make a fair judgment about their efficiencies goetz et al 2015 in this study the predictive performance of three different modelling approaches including mcda models ahp and anp ml models rf and svm and ensemble modelling based on the optimisation of dst rf svm ahp anp were compared and evaluated to map flood susceptibility the presented research compares two multi criteria decision analysis methods with two machine learning methods for flood susceptibility and evaluates how dempster shafer theory can be used for optimising the resulting flood susceptibility mapping ml models i e svm and rf were better than mcda methods ahp and anp and more importantly the rf model had the highest accuracy among all ml and mcda models the slight higher performance of the anp comparing to the ahp model can be because of the inter relation connections in the structure of the anp moreover the superiority of ml models to the mcda ones is due to the associated uncertainty in the criteria weightings based on the expert knowledge in mcda models however all approaches applied in this study showed good or excellent accuracy this result confirms the results of tehrany et al 2015b which evaluated the accuracy of svm model for modelling flood susceptibility in addition these results affirm those of rahmati and pourghasemi 2017 who used the rf model for flood susceptibility mapping this study shows the ensemble of ml and mcda approaches along with using dst for optimiaing the results by ensemble approach which is unique and yields better accuracy results for flood susceptibility mapping in the case of the ensemble approach some researchers have been used for flood susceptibility mapping tehrany et al 2013 applied an ensemble bivariate and multivariate statistical models and indicated that the ensemble model was better than single models in another study they have developed new ensemble models using weights of evidence and support vector machine models tehrany et al 2014 their results demonstrated that the ensemble model outperformed other single models in this field of study as discussed by termeh et al 2018 novel ensembles of adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system and metaheuristic algorithms had better prediction performance for flood susceptibility mapping our study also clearly highlighted that the ensemble model of dst with both ml and mcda produced a better prediction of flood susceptibility the mcda methods of ahp and anp shows good accuracy results of 0 859 and 0 866 respectively however the accuracy results are higher in the ml methods of rf and svm with both having accuracy 0 87 this accuracy result shows that machine learning methods are much more suited for flood susceptibility analysis compared to multi criteria decision analysis techniques the resulting flood susceptibility shows closer results the detected tps and fps were different and hence utilising dst for combining the mcda methods ml methods and both mcda ml methods have increased accuracy for flood susceptibility analysis the mcda fusion resulted in increased accuracy of 0 87 whereas the ml fusion increased the accuracy with 0 88 however the ensemble accuracy of mcda and ml had the highest accuracy of 0 89 compared to mcda and ml accuracies the use of dst shows that the resulting flood susceptibility can be increased and this method can be utilised for optimisation in floods and can be applied for other natural hazard susceptibility analysis as well the accuracy of the model also depends on the selection of input conditioning factors for flood susceptibility the higher number of factors would likely increase the model accuracy but this also depends on the study area and availability of the input conditioning factors datasets donati 2002 moreover the higher resolution of input datasets might also influence the outcome of susceptibility maps along with the selection and availability of conditioning factor datasets this study can be further applied to study the model s prediction accuracy in different terrain environments like the himalayas basins in nepal and india where the terrain is very different from the alpine region the conditioning factors might also differ as the terrain in himalayas are mainly mountainous which is quite different to the alpine terran and the selection of the conditioning factors will be based on the geographical suitability for the catchment and the region generally the results of the present research might be particularly beneficial in refining flood planning and management principles in the region for mitigating additional reparations owing to flooding this could be achieved by declaring no construction zones for residential or commercial properties in the susceptibility areas this could significantly reduce the financial and economic loss in future 8 conclusion the core goal of this study was to evaluate the use of mcda models like ahp and anp along with ml models like rf and svm for flood susceptibility mapping and to assess if dst would be a beneficial method for optimising the results from both mcda and ml along with combining both ml and mcda this study indicated that the ml models provided better accuracy results compared to the mcda models dst is a powerful method for optimising the results that can be applied for both mcda and ml models and the resulting susceptibility maps have improved accuracy results the ensemble mcda and ml showed the highest accuracy when used dst and ml had better accuracy results compared to mcda with and without dst according to the flood susceptibility maps the most affected or susceptible areas occur in the areas directly adjacent to the salzach river the outcomes and understandings gained from this research can deliver an enhanced understanding of flood susceptibility in the province of salzburg the results help in identifying the flood prone regions in the province of salzburg and this methodology can be practically applied to other parts of the region globe as well especially data scarce and ungauged regions as a final conclusion flood susceptibility mapping with ensemble models provides practical and accurate results for the prevention and mitigation of future flooding declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

introduction water is an indispensable resource influencing our economy and our way of life across the globe water has become an essential topic of dialogue floods are one of the utmost frequently occurring natural hazards in the world floods are natural phenomena that occur after a long duration of precipitation heavy rainfalls or snowmelt in combination with unfavourable conditions and flooding is one of the most destructive natural disaster occurring around the world kalantari et al 2019 in the recent decade flooding seems to be occurring quite frequently and this is due to the increase in environmental degradation such as population growth deforestation urbanisation and so on wang et al 2019 flooding occurs when a natural or modified system for drainage is not able to contain the water floods turn to risk when it affects people infrastructure and settlements the higher the risk of frequency in flooding the higher the potential damages flooding can cause severe damages to many aspects like economy human lives transportation ecological ecosystem infrastructures and cultural heritage sites yu et al 2013 flooding is the critical natural hazard where the exposure of its damage is not quantifiable rozalis et al 2010 climate change combined with socioeconomic development has a direct impact on floods and these factors will increase the risk of flooding in future and placing the community in danger kalantari et al 2014 globally the occurrence of floods has amplified by 40 over the last two decades hirabayashi et al 2013 analysis of flooding is quite vital for socioeconomic and environmental consequences markantonis et al 2013 flood susceptibility is a crucial task for emergency preparedness and management strategies on prevention and mitigation of floods sachdeva et al 2017 communities and infrastructures neighbouring to the rivers are the most exposed areas to the impact and effects of flooding jung et al 2011 the number of people living in the flood risk zone was estimated to be around 1 3 billion by 2050 ligtvoet et al 1991 austria is a country surrounded by land in central europe with a surface area of 83 879 km2 and a population of 8 7 million gudiyangada nachappa et al 2019 owing to the location in the alpine range and its climatic environments austria is at significant risk from natural hazards while many alpine areas in austria are susceptible to gravitational hazards like landslides debris flow and avalanches flooding affects the low lying areas of the country about 13 of all the buildings in austria are located in flooding areas and 1 million residents in austria live in flood prone areas fuchs et al 2015 austria experienced a series of large scale flooding along the danube and its tributaries in 2002 2005 2006 and 2013 fuchs et al 2012 annual daily precipitation is expected to increase over the years in many areas increasing the probability of severe floods in the alps gobiet et al 2014 kundzewicz et al 2010 geographic information system gis and remote sensing has been used as a useful tool for spatial analysis in hazard assessment ghorbanzadeh et al 2019c flood susceptibility analysis is the primary process to predict and mitigate the future occurrences of flooding kourgialas and karatzas 2011 flood susceptibility analysis has been carried out using various statistical models and probabilistic models levy 2007 natural disasters have been studied using various models like frequency ratio fr rahmati et al 2015a analytical hierarchical process ahp rahmati et al 2015b analytical network process

learning ml methods have been applied for natural hazard assessments like landslides floods and wildfires ghorbanzadeh et al 2019c jaafari et al 2019 tien bui et al 2019 any model used for assessments has advantages and disadvantages each model performance is centred on the data used accuracy and the structure besides there is no evidence that a particular model should be used for a particular scenario or study area khosravi et al 2018 in this research we use data based two new machine learning techniques such as svm rf and compare this against knowledge based commonly used multi criteria decision analysis models like ahp and anp for identifying flood prone areas and producing flood susceptibility maps in a recent study machine learning techniques like naïve bayes and naïve bayes tree were compared with multi criteria decision technique like vikor topsis and saw this study showed that ml has a higher prediction power compared to expert based mcda khosravi et al 2019 also evidence belief function ebf and ensemble techniques was applied for flood susceptibility analysis and compared it with topsis cart vikor and fr techniques where ebf model had higher accuracy arabameri et al 2019 chowdhuri et al 2020 mosavi et al 2018 advanced ml methods like feature selection simulate annealing with resampling algorithms were also used for flood susceptibility mapping hosseini et al 2020 all these ml and mcda methods are powerful however they are sensitive to some issues and exhibits a certain amount of weakness or uncertainties in the case of ml methods as the models are trained they are prone to the overlearning and the selection of the number of epochs in the training process may influence the results also the input data used for ml are typically specified to take a wide range of values while their output results in limited ranges however knowledge based mcda models have shown acceptable generic hazard mapping results where there is no access to a suitable inventory even though knowledge based methods have shown to have acceptable mapping it has been shown that uncertainty is connected with such methods that lead to inaccurate results ghorbanzadeh et al 2018b ghorbanzadeh et al 2018c dempster shafer theory dst which is also mentioned as evidence theory is principally based on representing independent sections of evidence by totally monotone capacities also known as belief functions and pooling them through a standard operator called dempster s rule of combination yager and liu 2008 this method has been used for various natural hazard assessments and we will use dempster shafer theory dst to optimise the results for both ml and mcda categories to optimise the results and reduce the uncertainty of the models the main drive and novelty of this research except comparing the various ml and mcda models for producing the flood susceptibility maps for the province of salzburg for the first time the ensemble using dempster shafer model for optimising the resulting susceptibility maps 2 study area theprovince of salzburg is a state in austria see fig 1 and the city of salzburg is the capital of the province of salzburg the total population of the province of salzburg is around 531 000 and has a density around 74 km2 the total area covered is 7156 03 km2 and the city of salzburg is the capital and the central city province of salzburg stretches along its primary river the salzach running from the central eastern alps in the south with an altitude of 3657 m above sea level the province of salzburg is situated along its primary river the salzach close to the border of germany salzach s drainage basin of 6829 km2 includes large parts of the northern limestone and the central eastern alps around 83 of the salzach basin lies in austria and the remainder in germany majority of the salzach basin is situated in the province of salzburg salzach basin experienced a series of large scale flooding along the danube and its tributaries in 2002 2005 2006 and 2013 fuchs et al 2012 annual daily precipitation is expected to increase over the years in many areas increasing the probability of severe floods in the alps gobiet et al 2014 kundzewicz et al 2010 the area is very dynamic in regard to it s economic and growths gudiyangada et al 2020 3 data 3 1 flood inventory map to predict the occurrences of future floods it is vital to analyse the occurrence of historical flooding events as the historical event data has a strong correlation with future predictive flooding khosravi et al 2016 for this research the flood inventory map was prepared based on the hochwasserrisikozonierung flood risk zoning hora flood data 30hq with polygon coverage and randomised locations were derived for each polygon based on the data the flood inventory was then categorised into training 70 and validation 30 randomly see fig 1 3 2 flood conditioning factors it is decisive to regulate the causative factors for the hazard in preparing for any of the natural hazard susceptibility mapping rahmati et al 2015a floods have interconnected causes or factors that are known as conditioning factors pourghasemi et al 2013 for this study eleven conditioning factors were used based on the study area and data availability the factors were elevation slope aspect topographic wetness index twi stream power index spi distance to drainage geology distance to roads rainfall ndvi and landcover see fig 2 these flood conditioning factors are differentiated into four different classes topographical hydrological environmental and anthropological see table 1 the digital elevation model dem data were downloaded from land salzburg with the resolution of 30 m for province of salzburg and secondary data like slope and aspect was derived from dem water related factors such as topographic wetness index twi and stream power index spi was derived from the dem geology and distance to drainage data were obtained from the geological survey of austria gba rainfall data was downloaded from öks15 from the ccca data centre for the province of salzburg normalised difference vegetation index ndvi was downloaded from land viewer eos and landcover data was obtained from the land information system austria lisa 3 2 1 topographical conditioning factors the elevation is an essential factor in flood susceptibility analysis rahmati et al 2015b the elevation defines the lowest and the highest point range in the region elevation can also influence the topographic factors and vegetation distribution khosravi et al 2016 the elevation was classified into five classes 0 500 m 500 1000 m 1000 1500 m 1500 2000 m and 2000 m above mean sea level in the alpine region vegetation fluctuations are witnessed as the elevation rises the slope is crucial in flood susceptibility as this regulates the surface runoff velocity and vertical percolation that affects the flood susceptibility the slope is measured as the surface indicator for flood susceptibility youssef et al 2011 the slope was classified into five classes from 0 to 40 by intervals of 10 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 and 40 aspect is an essential factor for flood susceptibility analysis aspect describes the direction of the slope we classified province of salzburg s slope aspect into ten classes north 0 22 5 337 5 360 northeast 22 5 67 5 east 67 5 112 5 southeast 112 5 157 5 south 157 5 202 5 southwest 202 5 247 5 west 247 5 292 5 northwest 292 5 337 5 north 337 5 360 and flat 0 twi is the accumulation of flow at any location in the catchment with consideration of downstream flow trends due to gravity gokceoglu et al 2005 the eq 1 to calculate twi beven and kirkby 1979 moore et al 1991 is twi l n α t a n β where α is the cumulative upslope area draining through a point per unit contour length and tan β is the slope angle in degrees at that point whereas the stream power index spi is the power of water flow in terms of erosion moore et al give the eq 2 to calculate spi moore et al 1991 spi α t a n β where α is the specific area of the catchment in m2 m of the catchment and tan β is the slope angle in degrees at that point 3 2 2 hydrological conditioning factors distance to drainage is one of the primary conditioning factors in flood susceptibility this factor has a significant impact on the spread of the flooding along with the magnitude tien bui et al 2019 the study area was categorised into five classes the classes were created for intervals of 0 250 m 250 500 m 500 750 m 750 1000 m and 1000 m rainfall is one of the vital triggering aspects of flooding wu et al 2016 rainfall characteristics vary by weather conditions and topographical characteristics and this causes considerable temporal and spatial differences in a rainfall event annual average precipitation for salzburg province was classified into four classes 0 1000 mm 1000 1500 mm 1500 2000 mm and 2000 mm 3 2 3 environmental conditioning factors geology plays a significant role in flood susceptibility owing to sensitivity to lithological units areas which have higher permeable soil and hard resistance rocks tend to have low channel densities wang et al 2019 we have six geological units in our study area mainly helvetic nappes austroalpine nappes penninic nappes molasse zone sub penninic nappes and water landcover can be used to explain the highly dissected zones within the region mohammadi et a 2019 land use is one of the vital conditioning factors for flood susceptibility assessments the landcover for the province of salzburg are classified as built up flat sealed surfaces permanent soil bare rock screes water snow ice trees bushes shrubs herbaceous and reeds the normalised difference vegetation index ndvi layer is a crucial factor in flood susceptibility and was derived from satellite image available at land viewer eos from 2019 this layer shows the vegetation coverage of the area the vegetation index value ranges from 1 to 1 the ndvi values were calculated using eq 4 shahabi et al 2012 ndvi nir v i s nir v i s where nir is the spectral reflectance measured in the infrared bands of the electromagnetic spectrum and vis is the spectral reflectance in the red band of the electromagnetic spectrum 3 2 4 anthropological conditioning factors roads are regarded as one of the most critical anthropogenic factors influencing the flooding kalantari et al 2014 the study area was categorised into five different classes which nominated the influence of flooding caused by roads the interval of buffer zones was 0 200 m 200 400 m 400 600 m 600 800 m and 800 m all the conditioning factors were classified into 30 m cell size resolution for flood susceptibility analysis 4 methods models 4 1 multi criteria decision analysis mcda a common approach to decipher spatially related problems along with natural hazard assessments is using multi criteria decision analysis mcda this approach provides a geospatial framework to manage diverse conditioning factors or thematic layers into a hierarchical configuration and evaluate the relations between the components duleba and moslem 2019 gis centred multi criteria decision analysis mcda is a robust modelling approach in spatial sciences gis and mcda have been conclusively linked to resolving a diversity of spatially linked problems ghorbanzadeh et al 2018b the gis mcda approach combines data resulting from several geographical aspects into a single index of assessment gis mcda forms a framework that manages diverse modules of the spatial decision problem and can be used for assessing the interactions between numerous components in multifaceted problems gis based mcda gis mcda offers an intelligent spatial planning method for identifying the relative importance of conditioning factors the capabilities of gis combined with mcda have solved a wide range of spatial problems analytical hierarchical process ahp and analytic network process anp are the commonly used mcda methods shahabi et al 2014 the ahp is the most common gis mcda approaches that have been used for deriving the criteria weights for modelling tasks whereas anp was developed in the context of network approaches in order to minimize the errors involved in traditional ahp approach ahp anp has been used for flood susceptibility analysis by various studies using expert knowledge 4 1 1 analytical hierarchy process ahp ahp is one of the most generally used models in gis mcda methodologies shahabi et al 2014 this model supports the weighting process based on expert s knowledge that is organized in pairwise comparison matrices ahp is a simple decision making tool to deal with complex unstructured and multi attribute problems saaty 1980 ahp model has been extensively applied in several natural hazard assessments like landslides wildfire floods and earthquakes ghorbanzadeh et al 2018d this model is centred on multi criteria and multiple objectives and includes the contribution from the experts on their expert knowledge and judgement in depth knowledge of experts plays a critical role in formulating valuable pairwise comparison matrices pcm moslem et al 2019 theoretically pcm is reciprocal consistent and quadratic and the ahp utilises these unique characteristics of pcm however in the ahp process the experts most of the times do not evaluate the pcm consistently this can be checked using the eigenvector method where this checks if experts have carried out the consistency check for the evaluations for the evaluation by the experts an underlying scale is proposed for pairwise comparisons in the ahp model where values range from 1 to 9 this ranking has been provided in table 1 the expert assigns the value for each factor and each factor class weight from the matrix class is multiplied by the weight class the main important in ahp is the principle of transitivity for any of the three factors such as f1 f2 and f3 and this is defined as if f1 f2 and f2 f3 then f1 f3 the main base for conditioning factor weightings in ahp is the principle of transitivity owing to this principle of transitivity a consistent pairwise comparison matrix would require that if 2f1 f2 i e f1 is two times more preferable than f2 and 4f2 f3 then 8f1 f3 to account for the transitivity principle later consistency permanently must be checked during the ahp process and this can be achieved by using consistency index ci and the consistency ratio cr ghorbanzadeh et al 2018a ci is calculated using the eq 5 ci λ max n n 1 where ci is the consistency index λ max is the maximum eigenvalue and n is the number of rows in the matrix cr can be calculated by using the eq 6 cr ci ri where ci is the consistent index and ri is the random index for the randomly created pairwise comparison matrix where n 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 if the cr is 0 10 it indicates a suitable level of consistency whereas a cr 0 10 indicates an inappropriate level of consistency ghorbanzadeh et al 2018c table 2 shows the consistency index ci for a randomly generated matrix 4 1 2 analytical network process anp the analytical network process is broadly used to derive criteria weightings in modelling analysis and most frequently used gis mcda technique ghorbanzadeh et al 2017 this is a variation of the analytical hierarchical process which was established for network methods to reduce the errors in the traditional ahp this anp method entails experts with comprehensive knowledge in the domain in order to create the pairwise comparison matrix pcm in an effective and reliable manner an anp model offers a logical way of dealing with dependence and can resolve complex issues with interdependent relationships as anp is built on mathematical theory this can help in overcoming all different types of dependencies the pcm can be derived using the pairwise comparison matrix provided in the table 1 on a scale of 1 9 going from equal significance of factors to extreme supremacy of one factor over another saaty 1980 the anp builds a network that contains small to large matrices of elements and probable substitutes that are congregated into clusters these elements can be intertwined in any number of conceivable ways within the network the network comprises feedback and interdependence connections within and between the clusters aragonés beltrán et al 2008 the component of supermatrix is given below in the formula w w i 1 j 1 w i 2 j 1 w i n i j 1 w i 1 j 2 w i 2 j 2 w i n i j 2 w i 1 j n j w i 2 j n j w i n i j n j the priority of each pairwise comparison matrix is calculated separately the results of all individual pairwise comparison matrices are collected into an overall supermatrix in order to assess the final weightings of the elements saaty 1980 the supermatrix w illustrates the influence of each element on other elements within the network system the anp includes small to large matrices of criteria and probable substitutes to form a network which is assembled into clusters these substitutes or alternatives can be intertwined in numerous likely means within the network and this network contains interdependence connections and feedbacks within and between clusters ghorbanzadeh et al 2018b for the evaluation by the experts an underlying scale is proposed for pairwise comparisons in the ahp model where values range from 1 to 9 this ranking has been provided in table 1 the cluster matrix for anp is shown in table 4 that has the factors classified into topographical hydrological environmental and anthropological 4 2 machine learning models machine learning techniques have contributed greatly during the previous few years in the progression of prediction systems providing improved performance and economical solutions ghorbanzadeh et al 2018e ghorbanzadeh et al 2019a the constant progress of ml approaches over the last few years established their appropriateness for flood predicting with an adequate rate of overtaking conservative methods ml approaches are data driven models that can mathematically express flood nonlinearity constructed on previous data without needing the understanding of the fundamental physical process khosravi et al 2019 ml is independent of expert knowledge but it entirely depends strongly on the inventory data ml models have been used for various hazard assessments and producing susceptibility maps for wildfire and landslides gholamnia et al 2020 for this study we have used support vector machines svm and random forest rf as two machine learning methods for flood susceptibility and used google earth engine for the ml analysis 4 2 1 support vector machines svm support vector machine is a data mining machine learning method universally used with a set of linear indicator functions which is used for the issues function estimations vapnik 2013 svm is also known as the maximum margin method which can provide higher performance and better results with limited data points mohammadi et al 2019 svm is grounded on statistical learning theory that maps the dataset into a high dimensional feature space through nonlinear transformers to create the best hyperplane kavzoglu et al 2013 the best hyperplane can be obtained when separating margins between the defined classes of the problem are maximal svms are unidirectional and have two layers that can implement diverse activation functions like linear polynomial radial or sigmoid the performance of the svm model is influenced by the kernel functions like linear polynomial sigmoid and radial basis function rbf bui et al 2016 four kernel categories were used for this svm approach to understand the efficiency of classification and susceptibility mapping along with the type as string 4 2 2 random forest rf random forest rf algorithm was first created using the random subspace method ho 1995 random forest rf is a machine learning technique where the input dataset is classified based on the ensemble of multiple decision trees rf has received growing attention in recent years due to its ability to produce excellent classification results along with the processing speed du et al 2015 additionally a random set of features are selected at each stage when forecasting output and each of the output is weighted by the value derived from the votes that it obtains the majority vote based on the outputs of assessed decision trees converge in a single decision tree for the final classification ghorbanzadeh et al 2019b xu et al 2018 to overcome the uncertainty problem use a single decision tree and this will result in higher prediction accuracy valdez et al 2017 the crucial step in the rf classification is to derive high variance from different decision trees rf is considered one of the key operative non parametric ensemble learning methods in susceptibility mapping the key training possibilities in the rf model is the usage of maximum number of trees the variable number which is required in the split search and the variant of sampling process tavakkoli piralilou et al 2019 the first and the second training options are considered in split searching of the rf the usage of maximum number of trees were set to 500 for this analysis 4 2 3 dempster shafer theory dst the dst was suggested by dempster and extended by shafer dempster 1967 shafer 1976 dst is a generalisation of bayesian methodology which permits for a general level of uncertainty and offers a means to account explicitly for the unidentified possible cause of observational data hall 1996 dst utilises belief uncertainty intervals based on evidence of multiple observations to present the belief of assumptions feizizadeh 2018 dst is a precision fusion algorithm that exploits probability driven pieces of evidence reasoning and weight enclosed within the dataset dst is an efficient and time effective substitute that decreases the amount of time required to select training sites kabolizade et al 2010 tavakkoli piralilou et al 2019 dst model has been applied in remote sensing applications like landslide susceptibility mapping mohammady et al 2012 groundwater assessment nampak et al 2014 moreover the dst is well known as evidence theory which defines basic probability assignments bpa function to provide the combination of evidence martin et al 2010 it defines hypotheses in a hierarchical structure developed from a basic set of hypotheses that form the frame of discernment eastman 2012 the dst is an effective method for modelling imprecision and uncertainty assessment and it can provide additional flexibility for the specification of uncertainty in probabilistic models and hypothesis testing the dst has mostly focused on uncertain reasoning in artificial intelligence and expert systems in this theory displaying information requires two essential functions which are named bel and plausibility function pl which derives the lower bound value for a known probability function and the upper bound for a probability function an unknown probability function respectively the differentiation between bel and pl illustrates the uncertainty of the knowledge about the objective proposition fig 3 shows the schematic of dst combinations the dst provides an extension of the probability framework for assessing the uncertainty of any imprecision event of the probability p ml that the alternative method ml l 1 n be correct the lower bound indicates the degree of knowledge or belief that supports ml and represents by bel ml whereas the upper bound donates to the fact of ml and called plausibility pl ml baraldi and zio 2010 see the eqs 10 and 11 10 bel a b a m b 11 pl a b a 0 m b where the summation is engaged over all sets b 2 ɵ with b a in the definition of bel and the summation in that of pl is taken over all b 2 ɵ with b a 0 which the set of ɵ is mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive hypotheses and the power set of ɵ is denoted by 2ɵ the bel is the summation of all masses directly assigned to that by a set of hypothesis a while the plausibility sums all masses not assigned to the complement of the hypothesis a an uncertainty interval is defined as if b e l a p l a that has the following properties b e l a p l a p l a 1 b e l a where ā is the negation of a and bel ā is called the disbelief function these properties indicate that the unknown true probability lies somewhere between the belief and plausibility functions the difference between these two functions which is called the belief interval or ignorance represents the ignorance of one s belief of the target proposition a and can be regarded as a measure of the imprecision of knowledge about the uncertainty of set of a rottensteiner et al 2005 this belief interval or ignorance is the main distinguishing feature of the dst of evidence compared to the traditional probability theory from the general point of view unlike a probabilistic theory that allocates a mass to the individual elementary events the theory of evidence or the bpa makes m a on the set a of the p z power sets of space z event i e on a set of results rather than a single elementary event 4 3 accuracy assessment 4 3 1 receiver operating characteristic roc validation is a significant step in evaluating the accuracy of each model validation of the results specifies the superiority of the models arabameri et al 2019 we used receiver operating characteristic roc for accuracy assessment of the models in this study area the area under the curve auc was used for the evaluation and quantitative comparison of the methods used for flood susceptibility mapping for the validation we have used 70 of the inventory for model training and 30 of the inventory for model validation training and validation datasets were selected based on the size of the study area inventory data and the applied methodology the receiver operating characteristic curve roc is a broadly used standard procedure to define the performance of the models specifically in spatial modelling chen et al 2017 4 3 2 relative flood density r index the accuracy of flood susceptibility mapping is also evaluated using the index of relative flood density r index we used the testing landslide points for validating the susceptibility maps the equation for r index is given as r ni ni σ ni ni 100 where ni is the percentage of the area that is susceptible to flooding in each susceptibility class and ni is the percentage of flood locations in each susceptibility class fig 4 shows the overall workflow of the applied methodology including the mcda ml and dst approaches for flood susceptibility mapping the mcda analysis was carried out using matlab and the ml analysis was carried out in google earth engine the processing of the conditioning factors and preparing the final classified susceptibility maps were prepared using arcgis 10 software 5 results 5 1 multi criteria decision analysis mcda the mcda results were derived using the expert based pairwise comparison matrix and final flood susceptibility mapping was derived using weighted overlay methodology see table 5 and 6 the ahp and anp weights were generated through expert knowledge through pairwise comparison matrices there is no standard method for the classification of the resulting susceptibility maps all the results were normalised to values between 0 and 100 for consistency and comparison the results were classified into five classes of very low low moderate high and very high susceptibility levels using quantile classification method that distributes the values into groups that contain an equal number of values this is better than the commonly used natural breaks where some classes might have limited or excessive number of values see fig 5 5 2 machine learning ml the flood susceptibility maps of the study area generated by two ml models show the same overall spatial pattern with high flood susceptibility in the northern and central parts of the study area fig 6 however the spatial detail of each model also differs that came from their modelling structures 5 3 dempster shafer optimisation the dst was used for grouping mcda approaches like ahp anp and ml techniques like rf and svm using the fusion level analysis technique mezaal et al 2018 and fused into a class of flood areas based on dst we fused both the mcda techniques as well as both the ml techniques to derive dst optimised mcda and ml susceptibility map along with the entire four techniques combined susceptibility map fig 7 in the inventory dataset the location of flooding is modified as the corresponding pixels hence for the dst process the inventory data is considered as the polygons of each pixel however the resulting fusion for mcda and ml are not classified into different susceptibility classes thus we chose quantile classification schema to classify the resulting fusion susceptibility maps into five classes namely very high high moderate low and very low for the application of dst these categories were then converted into two classes of one and zero the classes of one refer to high and very high whereas zero refers to very low low and moderate susceptibility classes therefore all the four output susceptibility maps from ahp anp rf and svm was converted into a binary map of one and zero several bels were combined in the dst within the same frame that makes it possible to harmonies the flood susceptible fs areas from these techniques the probability of uncertainty in the fs areas can be derived from bel and pl therefore the resulted fs areas of four outputs ahp anp were combined by fusing the dst with only the training inventory dataset the accuracy of the flood areas based on each technique was assessed using a confusion matrix and accordingly the bels were estimated by a precision function mezaal et al 2018 the dst combined the majority of fs areas which are closer to the inventory dataset and then assigned them into the class of flood area based on the dst the resulting flood susceptibility maps are based on the dst that is converted into the same five classes using the quantile classification technique 6 model validation as already mentioned 30 of the inventory data were not used for training the models and considered as the validation data therefore the resulting maps were compared with the validation data to find the performance of each model the roc curves are used for validating the resulting maps with the validation dataset to determine the accuracy of the model see figs 8 and 9 this vertical axis of the curve represents the true positives tp and the horizontal axis represents the false positives fp of the curve this validation shows the tradeoff between tps and fps ghorbanzadeh et al 2018e tps are the pixels that are correctly labelled as susceptible to flood and fps are the pixels that incorrectly labelled as susceptible to flood roc obtains the tps and fps of every pixel in the validation dataset and then plots tps vs fps across the range of values ghorbanzadeh et al 2018a the area under the curve auc is a measurement that represents the accuracy of the results of each prediction models the auc specifies the probability that the value of a correctly labelled pixel will surpass the value of an incorrectly labelled pixel the higher the auc values the higher the accuracy of the model and vice versa auc value close to 1 represents a perfect model with the highest accuracy and auc value equal to or 0 5 indicates that the model is not worthy for the analysis there are no standard comparison results for the values of auc however there are some studies which employed intervals with linguistic measurements baird 2013 the table 3 shows the auc intervals with measurements see table 7 the relative flood density r index was used to assess the accuracy of flood susceptibility maps table 8 and fig 10 show the r index for each of the models and the corresponding area for each susceptibility class respectively 7 discussion modelling and simulation systems are valuable decision support tools to expand the knowledge of flood hazard management however the structure and nature of modelling approaches vary considerably resulting in different predictive performance and outputs importantly the availability of different modelling approaches enables decision makers to develop and implement efficient environmental plans hill and minsker 2010 on the other hand different models have been separately used in different regions for example in order to produce a flood susceptibility map tehrany et al 2015a used svm for flood susceptibility mapping in kuala terengganu basin malaysia rahmati and pourghasemi 2017 used rf model in golestan watershed iran and stefanidis and stathis 2013 applied ahp in kassandra peninsula greece thus comparative studies are needed to evaluate the performance of models in the same conditions and make a fair judgment about their efficiencies goetz et al 2015 in this study the predictive performance of three different modelling approaches including mcda models ahp and anp ml models rf and svm and ensemble modelling based on the optimisation of dst rf svm ahp anp were compared and evaluated to map flood susceptibility the presented research compares two multi criteria decision analysis methods with two machine learning methods for flood susceptibility and evaluates how dempster shafer theory can be used for optimising the resulting flood susceptibility mapping ml models i e svm and rf were better than mcda methods ahp and anp and more importantly the rf model had the highest accuracy among all ml and mcda models the slight higher performance of the anp comparing to the ahp model can be because of the inter relation connections in the structure of the anp moreover the superiority of ml models to the mcda ones is due to the associated uncertainty in the criteria weightings based on the expert knowledge in mcda models however all approaches applied in this study showed good or excellent accuracy this result confirms the results of tehrany et al 2015b which evaluated the accuracy of svm model for modelling flood susceptibility in addition these results affirm those of rahmati and pourghasemi 2017 who used the rf model for flood susceptibility mapping this study shows the ensemble of ml and mcda approaches along with using dst for optimiaing the results by ensemble approach which is unique and yields better accuracy results for flood susceptibility mapping in the case of the ensemble approach some researchers have been used for flood susceptibility mapping tehrany et al 2013 applied an ensemble bivariate and multivariate statistical models and indicated that the ensemble model was better than single models in another study they have developed new ensemble models using weights of evidence and support vector machine models tehrany et al 2014 their results demonstrated that the ensemble model outperformed other single models in this field of study as discussed by termeh et al 2018 novel ensembles of adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system and metaheuristic algorithms had better prediction performance for flood susceptibility mapping our study also clearly highlighted that the ensemble model of dst with both ml and mcda produced a better prediction of flood susceptibility the mcda methods of ahp and anp shows good accuracy results of 0 859 and 0 866 respectively however the accuracy results are higher in the ml methods of rf and svm with both having accuracy 0 87 this accuracy result shows that machine learning methods are much more suited for flood susceptibility analysis compared to multi criteria decision analysis techniques the resulting flood susceptibility shows closer results the detected tps and fps were different and hence utilising dst for combining the mcda methods ml methods and both mcda ml methods have increased accuracy for flood susceptibility analysis the mcda fusion resulted in increased accuracy of 0 87 whereas the ml fusion increased the accuracy with 0 88 however the ensemble accuracy of mcda and ml had the highest accuracy of 0 89 compared to mcda and ml accuracies the use of dst shows that the resulting flood susceptibility can be increased and this method can be utilised for optimisation in floods and can be applied for other natural hazard susceptibility analysis as well the accuracy of the model also depends on the selection of input conditioning factors for flood susceptibility the higher number of factors would likely increase the model accuracy but this also depends on the study area and availability of the input conditioning factors datasets donati 2002 moreover the higher resolution of input datasets might also influence the outcome of susceptibility maps along with the selection and availability of conditioning factor datasets this study can be further applied to study the model s prediction accuracy in different terrain environments like the himalayas basins in nepal and india where the terrain is very different from the alpine region the conditioning factors might also differ as the terrain in himalayas are mainly mountainous which is quite different to the alpine terran and the selection of the conditioning factors will be based on the geographical suitability for the catchment and the region generally the results of the present research might be particularly beneficial in refining flood planning and management principles in the region for mitigating additional reparations owing to flooding this could be achieved by declaring no construction zones for residential or commercial properties in the susceptibility areas this could significantly reduce the financial and economic loss in future 8 conclusion the core goal of this study was to evaluate the use of mcda models like ahp and anp along with ml models like rf and svm for flood susceptibility mapping and to assess if dst would be a beneficial method for optimising the results from both mcda and ml along with combining both ml and mcda this study indicated that the ml models provided better accuracy results compared to the mcda models dst is a powerful method for optimising the results that can be applied for both mcda and ml models and the resulting susceptibility maps have improved accuracy results the ensemble mcda and ml showed the highest accuracy when used dst and ml had better accuracy results compared to mcda with and without dst according to the flood susceptibility maps the most affected or susceptible areas occur in the areas directly adjacent to the salzach river the outcomes and understandings gained from this research can deliver an enhanced understanding of flood susceptibility in the province of salzburg the results help in identifying the flood prone regions in the province of salzburg and this methodology can be practically applied to other parts of the region globe as well especially data scarce and ungauged regions as a final conclusion flood susceptibility mapping with ensemble models provides practical and accurate results for the prevention and mitigation of future flooding declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

5176,the research consisted in a detailed analysis of rain on snow ros events in the winter season november april in the area of waldemarbreen and irenebreen two glaciers subject to long term monitoring on kaffiøyra nw spitsbergen the intensity and frequency of ros events were evaluated along with their long term variability in the years 1976 2018 an attempt was made to identify the relationship between ros events and the properties of the snow cover of waldemarbreen and irenebreen mainly changes in the number and thickness of ice layers and snow density which have a major influence on the winter snowpack and on the time the snow begins to melt these are some of the first studies of this type concerning not only glacier forefields but also changes occurring on glaciers it was found that as the temperature of air has been rising in recent years the melting of snow has been beginning earlier on glaciers and in their forefields also the frequency and size of ros events has increased in recent years the number of days with heavy ros events mainly over 15 mm but also under 15 mm have been on the increase the ros events affect the number of ice layers whereas heavy ros events contribute to the formation of ice layers of greater thickness the increase in ros events is accompanied by a decrease in snow density on glaciers as with the number of ros events within a given year there is also a clear increase in the number of ice layers and their thickness on the snow cover in particular on small glaciers in the high arctic keywords rain on snow ros events snow ice

with precipitation during the polar winter ros events affect the properties of snow cover in the tundra and on glaciers so they play an important part in the shaping of snow accumulation on glaciers sobota 2017 the phenomenon of ros event is known in the literature cohen et al 2015 dolant et al 2017 łupikasza et al 2019 but little is known about their impact with respect to snow cover on glaciers during the 20th century precipitation in the arctic and boreal regions has increased approximately 1 4 per decade with the greatest increases in precipitation occurring in autumn and winter mcbean

and strand 2016 putkonen and roe 2003 claimed that field data from spitsbergen and numerical modelling revealed that ros events can substantially increase sub snowpack soil temperatures and that the occurrence of spitsbergen ros events is controlled by the north atlantic oscillation many studies of snow on glaciers in svalbard have focused on its accumulation and distribution e g tveit and killingtveit 1994 sand et al 2003 grabiec et al 2011 małecki 2016 the snow cover on kaffiøyra glaciers has been described in detail by grześ and sobota 2000 and sobota 2011 2017 with a focus on its spatial diversity and properties ice layers in the snow and their quantity and thickness in a given winter season may be used as an indicator of the prevailing weather conditions and thus provide evidence of changes occurring in this part of the cryosphere sobota 2017 the main objective of this work is to identify the relationship between ros events and the properties of the snow cover of waldemarbreen and irenebreen we focus on the number and thickness of ice layers and snow density which have a major influence on snow accumulation snowpack structure and on the periods when the snow melts for this purpose the air temperature and the precipitation in the regions of ny ålesund and kaffiøyra in the years 1976 2018 were analysed with a focus on the periods with air temperature above 0 5 c and with precipitation as a measure of ros 2 research area waldemarbreen and irenebreen on which the observations were carried out are located in the kaffiøyra region of nw spitsbergen the

glaciers are polythermal and considerable areas of icing fields have been observed in their forefields in winter 3 methods 3 1 meteorological data in order to estimate the number of ros events daily mean air temperatures and daily precipitation totals were used for climate analysis of winters during the entire 1976 2018 period from november until april to analyse long term changes in the kaffiøyra region in that time meteorological data were obtained from eklima ny ålesund station a climate and meteorological database hosted by the norwegian meteorological institute eklima portal http eklima met no maturilli et al 2013 the air temperature and precipitation in kaffiøyra region ncu polar station in the comparable summer time 21 july to 31 august are strongly correlated with the data provided by the norwegian weather station in ny ålesund correlation coefficient between daily average temperatures in ny ålesund and kaffiøyra region is very high 0 99 kejna and sobota 2019 in the winter months of 2014 2018 november may the correlation was also very high and reached 0 97 the correlation coefficient between the seasonal totals of precipitation in ny ålesund and kaffiøyra is lower than in the case of air temperature but it is still very high r 0 72 przybylak et al 2011 it is also important that winter rain on svalbard is strongly correlated spatially r 0 62 over distances up to 410 km peeters et al 2019 it is generally assumed that winter in svalbard begins on 1 november and lasts until 30 april maturilli et al 2014 eckerstorfer and christiansen 2012 spitsbergen has an early snow season october february and a late snow season march june lópez moreno et al 2016 for the period from november until april such parameters as precipitation mean air temperature number of days with temperatures above 0 5 c and the positive degree day sum pdd were analysed the parameters that have been analysed in detail to learn about the variability of meteorological conditions that may affect the development number and intensity of ros events on kaffiøyra region glaciers are described in table 1 3 2 ros events analysis putkonen et al 2009 assume that ros events occur when there is at least 10 mm of rainfall førland and hanssen bauer 2003 consider ros events to be the sums of all precipitation on days when air temperature is higher than the so called threshold temperature which is the temperature allowing water to change from the solid to the liquid phase in this article ros events are considered to occur whenever there is precipitation on a day with a diurnal air temperature above 0 5 c in winter as air temperature is somewhat lower than at 2 m above the ground the value of 0 5 c was established as the threshold temperature for glaciers too this made it possible to refer to actual measurement data in order to determine the influence of ros events on the snow cover on glaciers additionally each day with a positive air temperature warm events is here seen as a potential time when warm spells may cause snow to melt and then re freeze and an ice cover or ice layers to form dolant et al 2017 found that the mean observed air temperature during ros was 0 05 3 77 c to determine the variability of the intensity of ros events their number was also identified in various intervals additionally the ice layer thickness and annual number of ros events were determined including heavy ros events when the diurnal precipitation total exceeded 15 mm 3 3 snow accumulation and its properties to analyse the snow accumulation and its properties we used data from waldemarbreen and irenebreen on waldemarbreen the observations were carried out in the years 1997 2018 but in 2002 2018 on irenebreen additionally we used data reported by sobota 2017 the properties of the snow were based on stratigraphy taken from snow pits in the accumulation zones on both glaciers fig 1 in april or early may snow density structure grain type and hardness were measured in pits using standard methods fierz et al 2009 cogley et al 2011 particular attention was drawn to the quantitative analysis of ice layers in individual winter seasons as a consequence of ros events such parameters were analysed as the total number of ice layers and their total thickness in each year as well as snow thickness identification of ros events with different intensities but affecting the development of ice covers and ice layers on the snow is problematic it should be noted that the observed ice layers developed during a single winter season rather than in the firn built up in the past seasons as they were located higher in the profile it is noteworthy that the analysis included the ice layers formed in the snow cover of the accumulation zone of the glaciers where the prevailing weather conditions are often different from those found in the lower areas and in the tundra observations carried out by sobota 2017 further revealed that the number of ice layers identified in a given year coincided with number of periods of temperature above 0 c additionally an attempt was made at referencing the obtained results to the extent of changes in snowpack on the analysed glaciers the changes in their mass were described in detail by sobota 2013 sobota et al 2016a and sobota 2017 in order to visualise the beginning of melt at the time when direct field observations were not possible time lapse images from cameras were used for 2018 mean dates of the beginning of snow cover melt were identified on the basis of the first recorded positive diurnal air temperature in may june fptd and the first positive air temperature recorded after all the days with negative diurnal air temperature fptdan 4 results 4 1 long term meteorological conditions the november april average mean temperature between 1976 and 2018 was 10 6 c the highest temperature in that period was recorded in 2006 and reached 6 0 c and the lowest 15 6 c was recorded in 1981 fig 3 in 1997 2018 the tavena was 1 4 c higher the lowest temperature in that period occurred in 1998 and it was 12 1 c in 1976 2018 the trend for the mean air temperature was 0 135 c a 1 fig 3a the positive degree days sum pdd from november to april is an important indication of changes in winter weather conditions fig 3b in the entire period it averaged at 11 9 c and in 1997 2018 at 13 8 c an increase in the positive degree days sum has been observed especially since the early 21st century the mean precipitation from november to april psna in the years 1976 2018 was 241 7 mm in the years 1997 2018 it increased to 253 2 mm fig 3c in 1976 2018 the trend for the mean yearly precipitation was 2 648 mm a 1 table 2 and in 1997 2018 it was 7 793 mm a 1 2 317 p 0 003 4 2 ros events in 1976 2018 the pdn t 0 5 na was 5

case of the relationship between ros 15 mm and pdn t 0 5 na pdnp t 0 5 na and tdn t 0 5 na the correlation coefficient exceeded 0 90 table 3 it was estimated that in 1976 2018 the number of days with air temperature above 0 5 c from november to may and with precipitation and thus favourable to ros events was 235 days ros events of 5 mm or more were recorded 97 times with the highest frequency in 2012 days with ros events and precipitation above 10 mm occurred 54 times and 34 times with more than 15 mm of precipitation it must be underlined that in some years the maximum diurnal precipitation totals on days with positive air temperature clearly exceeded 20 mm leading to heavy ros events an evident increase in the severity of ros events has also been observed over time both 15 mm and 15 mm fig 5 the percentage share of the sum of ros events in 1997 2018 i e the entire analysed period was 54 5 mm 59 10 mm 65 15 mm and 58 20 mm 4 3 snow conditions and ice layers analysis in the years 1997 2009 in the case of waldemarbreen a slight increase in snow accumulation was observed the change of it with time was estimated to be 0 018 0 007 m w e a 1 sobota 2017 on the other hand days with a mean temperature above 0 c after the winter season which mark the beginning of snow melt occur earlier and earlier year by year fig 6 that happened in 2018 when thawing weather and melting occurred earlier than usual at the beginning of may fig 7 whereas in 2014 it was in early june the mean air temperature of may and june were found to increase in 1976 2018 fig 6a the trend for the mean monthly air temperature in may was 0 047 ca 1 0 017 p 0 008 and in june it was 0 048 ca 1 0 010 p 0 000 the average date of the first occurrence of a positive diurnal mean temperature fptd in may and june 1976 2018 was 14 may and the date of the first positive diurnal temperature after which no negative temperatures fptdan followed was 7 june in the years 1976 1995 the mean fptd was estimated to have occurred on 15 may and fptdan on 9 june on the other hand in the last decade the dates were 12 may and 5 june respectively fig 6b in the period 1976 2018 the average number of days with a mean diurnal air temperature above 0 5 c was 6 5 whereas in 1997 2018 it increased to 7 2 from 1976 to 2018 the total number of tdn t 0 5 na days was 280 and in the last two decades it was 159 days which is 57 of the whole reference period fig 8 the snow density in the accumulation zone of waldemarbreen ranged from 335 to 419 kgm 3 in 1997 2018 and from 346 to 378 kgm 3 in the case of irenebreen in 2002 2018 fig 9 a table 4 the density was correlated with the selected meteorological parameters the highest correlation was found with the highest precipitation total in the period when air temperature exceeded 0 5 c on waldemarbreen the snow density was best correlated statistically significantly with ros in the case of heavy ros events and precipitation all above 15 mm r 0 83 p 0 001 and those above 10 mm r 0 66 p 0 027 fig 9b on irenebreen it was for all above 5 mm r 0 97 p 0 000 and those above 10 mm r 0 90 p 0 006 fig 9c on waldemarbreen the highest number of ice layers were found in 2018 10 whereas in 1997 there were none observed the greatest total thickness of ice layers 32 and 21 cm was recorded in 2008 and 2018 respectively fig 10 on irenebreen on the other hand the greatest number of ice layers were found in 2018 8 and the greatest total thickness of those layers 24 and 11 cm was recorded in 2018 and 2007 respectively 5 discussion based on the analysis of meteorological data for nw spitsbergen positive trends in the values of individual climate characteristics were observed table 2 in the years 1976 2018 the number of days with precipitation from november to april increased and the trend reached 0 362 mm a 1 and was statistically significant in the same period the mean air temperature increased 0 135 ca 1 similar directions of changes were observed for the last two decades and the extent of those changes was even greater all of that contributed to the increase in the number size and frequency of ros events considering the influence of ros events on the polar environment and on the characteristics of the snow cover it is particularly important to note that in recent years the number of days with heavy ros events mainly over 15 mm but also under 15 mm have been on the increase fig 5 a similar increase in occurrence of extreme winter ros events has been described by langlois et al 2017 rennert et al 2009 found that the frequency of warm spells and heavy ros events in the arctic is increasing and is expected to increase further during the 21st century hansen et al 2014 noted that in svalbard extreme warm spells and heavy ros events in winter are already more frequent łupikasza et al 2019 also found an increase in frequency of winter rainfall october may in the southern part of svalbard between 1978 and 2017 particularly in october and november graham et al 2017 confirmed the rise in winter air temperature since about 1980 for the whole arctic ocean but some isolated warm winters in the arctic can be traced back to the times of the fram expedition in 1896 additionally snow cover is disappearing at ever earlier dates fig 6 the increasingly frequent and intense episodes of warm spells and liquid precipitation in winter cause changes in the properties of the snow cover on glaciers the changes manifest themselves mainly in the formation of ice layers on the kaffiøyra glaciers ice layers were observed in almost every winter season the number of warm spells in winter essentially matched the number of ice layers on the glaciers which was described by sobota 2017 moreover in 1997 2018 on waldemarbreen the number of ice layers and their thickness were both observed to increase this is a consequence of a greater number of days with positive temperatures and coinciding precipitation often exceeding 10 55 mm per day the mean thickness of the ice layers on the glaciers is not as great as the ice covers formed in their forefields and on the kaffiøyra plain during the entire period of observations the thickness of the ice layers on waldemarbreen ranged from 1 to 30 cm and from 1 to 20 cm on irenebreen although the maximum values occurred only once in the other winter seasons the thickness normally ranged from 1 to 4 cm which are lower values than those measured in the tundra on the kaffiøyra i e 5 5 to 13 cm according to hansen et al 2011 the total precipitation at the time of positive diurnal air temperature in winter has the greatest influence on the snow density this correlation was strong on waldemarbreen r 0 71 p 0 015 and very strong on irenebreen r 0 97 p 0 000 this shows that on the one hand percolating and freezing water increases the density of thinner snow covers but on the other hand an ice layer may protect the snow cover from the load of any overlying snow as a buffer zone separating the cover from the load of top snow layers especially in the initial phase of its duration and thus the mean snow density in a profile may be changed it was observed that as the number of ros events increased on waldemarbreen and irenebreen the snow density decreased considering the meteorological elements that favour the occurrence of ros events the number of ice layers on waldemarbreen was found to be best correlated with pdnp t 0 5 and pdd a similar relationship was observed for irenebreen the number of ice layers on waldemarbreen was best correlated with ros events 15 mm r 0 67 p 0 043 fig 11 the total thickness of ice layers was best correlated with ros events in the case of heavy ros events and especially precipitation above 20 mm the correlation coefficient reached 0 77 p 0 015 this means that positive air temperature in winter months and coinciding precipitation have the greatest influence on the formation of ice layers the same meteorological parameters affect the thickness of the ice layers on the glaciers the number of ice layers and their thickness both increase with the number of ros events on the glaciers in the case of waldemarbreen the development of snowpack was clearly affected by winter precipitation on days with positive air temperature łupikasza et al 2019 also found an increase in the frequency of winter rain in hornsund in south svalbard and that these events impact both glacier mass balance and glacier dynamics no evident relationship was found between wintertime thaw and ros events and the mass balance of the glaciers of kaffiøyra but the balance of these small glaciers is influenced by more than winter snow accumulation namely by the summer ablation summer balance of the glacier this is all the more true for the fact that in recent years summer ablation of the analysed glaciers has been exceptionally big sobota et al 2016a an increase in air temperature and the number of ros events including heavy ros events which in turn influence the characteristics of the snow cover its thickness which then influences the mass balance furthermore it has recently been noted that the beginning of snow cover melt on the glaciers is earlier than it was in the 1970 s and 1980 s fig 6 ros events increase the snowpack hardness by creating ice layers in the snow by refreezing rain water the increased hardness will decrease the potential of wind erosion and change the albedo density and conductivity of the snowpack and such affects the energy transfer through the snowpack conway and benedict 1994 noted that the downward penetration of water in a snowpack is impeded by buried hard snow and ice layers thaw induced ice layers in glacier snow cover may play a vital role in shaping the snow properties and its blowing off as well as its density which is significant for the water equivalent furthermore the ice layers form a protection against wind which may contribute to the spatial diversity of the snow thickness within the glacier consequently the snow cover thickness undergoes changes too a similar increase in ros events even in mid winter was also described including its role in the reduction of snow accumulation for the bayelva watershed svalbard kongsfjorden nowak and hodson 2013 warm spells in winter and increasingly frequent ros events affect the characteristics of the snow cover by increasing the number of ice layers which can influence snow accumulation and its properties 6 conclusions contemporary changes in climate lead to an increased frequency of rain on snow events including heavy ros events in the kaffiøyra region which affects the development of snow cover properties an increase in the positive degree days sum has been observed especially since the early 21st century warm spells in winter and the increasing number of ros events affect the characteristics of snow cover mainly by increasing the number of ice layers which may determine snow accumulation and density as well as its spatial distribution the increase in ros events is accompanied by a decrease in snow density on glaciers the ros events affect the number of ice layers whereas heavy ros events contribute to the formation of ice layers of greater thickness ice layers also make a valid indicator of ros events ros events may also have an indirect influence on glacier mass balance through changes in the properties of the snow cover yet in the case of small glaciers on nw spitsbergen in recent years the mass balance has been determined mainly by substantial summer ablation therefore there is not necessarily a direct correlation between mass glacier balance and the number of ros events at all times changes in the cryosphere are presently occurring on a number of levels such phenomena as ros events significantly shape the contemporary environment they also affect changes in the properties and thickness of snow cover one of the most dramatic consequences of such changes is the melting of glaciers in the high arctic and in other regions of the world as shown by the examples of waldemarbreen and irenebreen declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

5176,the research consisted in a detailed analysis of rain on snow ros events in the winter season november april in the area of waldemarbreen and irenebreen two glaciers subject to long term monitoring on kaffiøyra nw spitsbergen the intensity and frequency of ros events were evaluated along with their long term variability in the years 1976 2018 an attempt was made to identify the relationship between ros events and the properties of the snow cover of waldemarbreen and irenebreen mainly changes in the number and thickness of ice layers and snow density which have a major influence on the winter snowpack and on the time the snow begins to melt these are some of the first studies of this type concerning not only glacier forefields but also changes occurring on glaciers it was found that as the temperature of air has been rising in recent years the melting of snow has been beginning earlier on glaciers and in their forefields also the frequency and size of ros events has increased in recent years the number of days with heavy ros events mainly over 15 mm but also under 15 mm have been on the increase the ros events affect the number of ice layers whereas heavy ros events contribute to the formation of ice layers of greater thickness the increase in ros events is accompanied by a decrease in snow density on glaciers as with the number of ros events within a given year there is also a clear increase in the number of ice layers and their thickness on the snow cover in particular on small glaciers in the high arctic keywords rain on snow ros events snow ice

with precipitation during the polar winter ros events affect the properties of snow cover in the tundra and on glaciers so they play an important part in the shaping of snow accumulation on glaciers sobota 2017 the phenomenon of ros event is known in the literature cohen et al 2015 dolant et al 2017 łupikasza et al 2019 but little is known about their impact with respect to snow cover on glaciers during the 20th century precipitation in the arctic and boreal regions has increased approximately 1 4 per decade with the greatest increases in precipitation occurring in autumn and winter mcbean 2005 winter warm spells with near surface air temperatures above 0 c are becoming more frequent due to global warming graham et al 2017 peeters et al 2019 and these events are characterized as extraordinarily warm weather episodes occasionally combined with intense rainfall vikhamar schuler et al 2016 winter precipitation is projected to increase across much of the arctic bintanja and selten 2014 climate simulations predict an acceleration in the trends recently observed in svalbard for the next several decades with a projected increase in temperature three times greater than that

increasing the temperature of permafrost and the soils of the circumpolar arctic putkonen and roe 2003 rennert et al 2009 such extreme weather events have implications for snowpack and permafrost conditions and may lead to the formation of ground ice putkonen and roe 2003 westermann et al 2011 in mountainous areas ros events may destabilise snow cover and contribute to avalanches conway and

and strand 2016 putkonen and roe 2003 claimed that field data from spitsbergen and numerical modelling revealed that ros events can substantially increase sub snowpack soil temperatures and that the occurrence of spitsbergen ros events is controlled by the north atlantic oscillation many studies of snow on glaciers in svalbard have focused on its accumulation and distribution e g tveit and killingtveit 1994 sand et al 2003 grabiec et al 2011 małecki 2016 the snow cover on kaffiøyra glaciers has been described in detail by grześ and sobota 2000 and sobota 2011 2017 with a focus on its spatial diversity and properties ice layers in the snow and their quantity and thickness in a given winter season may be used as an indicator of the prevailing weather conditions and thus provide evidence of changes occurring in this part of the cryosphere sobota 2017 the main objective of this work is to identify the relationship between ros events and the properties of the snow cover of waldemarbreen and irenebreen we focus on the number and thickness of ice layers and snow density which have a major influence on snow accumulation snowpack structure and on the periods when the snow melts for this purpose the air temperature and the precipitation in the regions of ny ålesund and kaffiøyra in the years 1976 2018 were analysed with a focus on the periods with air temperature above 0 5 c and with precipitation as a measure of ros 2 research area waldemarbreen and irenebreen on which the observations were carried out are located in the kaffiøyra region of nw spitsbergen the kaffiøyra plain and its seven glaciers cover an area of 103 km2 sobota et al 2016a fig 1 the nicolaus copernicus university ncu station is situated at the forefield of aavatsmarkbreen grześ et al 2009

the region the two glaciers are receding sobota et al 2016b the snow accumulation on waldemarbreen in 1997 2009 and on irenebreen in 2005 2009 revealed a slightly positive trend sobota 2017 fig 2 the glaciers are polythermal and considerable areas of icing fields have been observed in their forefields in winter 3 methods 3 1 meteorological data in order to estimate the number of ros events daily mean air temperatures and daily precipitation totals were used for climate analysis of winters during the entire 1976 2018 period from november until april to analyse long term changes in the kaffiøyra region in that time meteorological data were obtained from eklima ny ålesund station a climate and meteorological database hosted by the norwegian meteorological institute eklima portal http eklima met no maturilli et al 2013 the air temperature and precipitation in kaffiøyra region ncu polar station in the comparable summer time 21 july to 31 august are strongly correlated with the data provided by the norwegian weather station in ny ålesund correlation coefficient between daily average temperatures in ny ålesund and kaffiøyra region is very high 0 99 kejna and sobota 2019 in the winter months of 2014 2018 november may the correlation was also very high and reached 0 97 the correlation coefficient between the seasonal totals of precipitation in ny ålesund and kaffiøyra is lower than in the case of air temperature but it is still very high r 0 72 przybylak et al 2011 it is also important that winter rain on svalbard is strongly correlated spatially r 0 62 over distances up to 410 km peeters et al 2019 it is generally assumed that winter in svalbard begins on 1 november and lasts until 30 april maturilli et al 2014 eckerstorfer and christiansen 2012 spitsbergen has an early snow season october february and a late snow season march june lópez moreno et al 2016 for the period from november until april such parameters as precipitation mean air temperature number of days with temperatures above 0 5 c and the positive degree day sum pdd were analysed the parameters that have been analysed in detail to learn about the variability of meteorological conditions that may affect the development number and intensity of ros events on kaffiøyra region glaciers are described in table 1 3 2 ros events analysis putkonen et al 2009 assume that ros events occur when there is at least 10 mm of rainfall førland and hanssen bauer 2003 consider ros events to be the sums of all precipitation on days when air temperature is higher than the so called threshold temperature which is the temperature allowing water to change from the solid to the liquid phase in this article ros events are considered to occur whenever there is precipitation on a day with a diurnal air temperature above 0 5 c in winter as air temperature is somewhat lower than at 2 m above the ground the value of 0 5 c was established as the threshold temperature for glaciers too this made it possible to refer to actual measurement data in order to determine the influence of ros events on the snow cover on glaciers additionally each day with a positive air temperature warm events is here seen as a potential time when warm spells may cause snow to melt and then re freeze and an ice cover or ice layers to form dolant et al 2017 found that the mean observed air temperature during ros was 0 05 3 77 c to determine the variability of the intensity of ros events their number was also identified in various intervals additionally the ice layer thickness and annual number of ros events were determined including heavy ros events when the diurnal precipitation total exceeded 15 mm 3 3 snow accumulation and its properties to analyse the snow accumulation and its properties we used data from waldemarbreen and irenebreen on waldemarbreen the observations were carried out in the years 1997 2018 but in 2002 2018 on irenebreen additionally we used data reported by sobota 2017 the properties of the snow were based on stratigraphy taken from snow pits in the accumulation zones on both glaciers fig 1 in april or early may snow density structure grain type and hardness were measured in pits using standard methods fierz et al 2009 cogley et al 2011 particular attention was drawn to the quantitative analysis of ice layers in individual winter seasons as a consequence of ros events such parameters were analysed as the total number of ice layers and their total thickness in each year as well as snow thickness identification of ros events with different intensities but affecting the development of ice covers and ice layers on the snow is problematic it should be noted that the observed ice layers developed during a single winter season rather than in the firn built up in the past seasons as they were located higher in the profile it is noteworthy that the analysis included the ice layers formed in the snow cover of the accumulation zone of the glaciers where the prevailing weather conditions are often different from those found in the lower areas and in the tundra observations carried out by sobota 2017 further revealed that the number of ice layers identified in a given year coincided with number of periods of temperature above 0 c additionally an attempt was made at referencing the obtained results to the extent of changes in snowpack on the analysed glaciers the changes in their mass were described in detail by sobota 2013 sobota et al 2016a and sobota 2017 in order to visualise the beginning of melt at the time when direct field observations were not possible time lapse images from cameras were used for 2018 mean dates of the beginning of snow cover melt were identified on the basis of the first recorded positive diurnal air temperature in may june fptd and the first positive air temperature recorded after all the days with negative diurnal air temperature fptdan 4 results 4 1 long term meteorological conditions the november april average mean temperature between 1976 and 2018 was 10 6 c the highest temperature in that period was recorded in 2006 and reached 6 0 c and the lowest 15 6 c was recorded in 1981 fig 3 in 1997 2018 the tavena was 1 4 c higher the lowest temperature in that period occurred in 1998 and it was 12 1 c in 1976 2018 the trend for the mean air temperature was 0 135 c a 1 fig 3a the positive degree days sum pdd from november to april is an important indication of changes in winter weather conditions fig 3b in the entire period it averaged at 11 9 c and in 1997 2018 at 13 8 c an increase in the positive degree days sum has been observed especially since the early 21st century the mean precipitation from november to april psna in the years 1976 2018 was 241 7 mm in the years 1997 2018 it increased to 253 2 mm fig 3c in 1976 2018 the trend for the mean yearly precipitation was 2 648 mm a 1 table 2 and in 1997 2018 it was 7 793 mm a 1 2 317 p 0 003 4 2 ros events in 1976 2018 the pdn t 0 5 na was 5 5 while in 1997 2018 it increased to 5 8 days and to 6 5 days in the most recent decade the mean value of psna was 38 4 mm but in the most recent decade of 2008 2018 it was 16 9 mm higher fig 4 in the case of the relationship between ros 15 mm and pdn t 0 5 na pdnp t 0 5 na and tdn t 0 5 na the correlation coefficient exceeded 0 90 table 3 it was estimated that in 1976 2018 the number of days with air temperature above 0 5 c from november to may and with precipitation and thus favourable to ros events was 235 days ros events of 5 mm or more were recorded 97 times with the highest frequency in 2012 days with ros events and precipitation above 10 mm occurred 54 times and 34 times with more than 15 mm of precipitation it must be underlined that in some years the maximum diurnal precipitation totals on days with positive air temperature clearly exceeded 20 mm leading to heavy ros events an evident increase in the severity of ros events has also been observed over time both 15 mm and 15 mm fig 5 the percentage share of the sum of ros events in 1997 2018 i e the entire analysed period was 54 5 mm 59 10 mm 65 15 mm and 58 20 mm 4 3 snow conditions and ice layers analysis in the years 1997 2009 in the case of waldemarbreen a slight increase in snow accumulation was observed the change of it with time was estimated to be 0 018 0 007 m w e a 1 sobota 2017 on the other hand days with a mean temperature above 0 c after the winter season which mark the beginning of snow melt occur earlier and earlier year by year fig 6 that happened in 2018 when thawing weather and melting occurred earlier than usual at the beginning of may fig 7 whereas in 2014 it was in early june the mean air temperature of may and june were found to increase in 1976 2018 fig 6a the trend for the mean monthly air temperature in may was 0 047 ca 1 0 017 p 0 008 and in june it was 0 048 ca 1 0 010 p 0 000 the average date of the first occurrence of a positive diurnal mean temperature fptd in may and june 1976 2018 was 14 may and the date of the first positive diurnal temperature after which no negative temperatures fptdan followed was 7 june in the years 1976 1995 the mean fptd was estimated to have occurred on 15 may and fptdan on 9 june on the other hand in the last decade the dates were 12 may and 5 june respectively fig 6b in the period 1976 2018 the average number of days with a mean diurnal air temperature above 0 5 c was 6 5 whereas in 1997 2018 it increased to 7 2 from 1976 to 2018 the total number of tdn t 0 5 na days was 280 and in the last two decades it was 159 days which is 57 of the whole reference period fig 8 the snow density in the accumulation zone of waldemarbreen ranged from 335 to 419 kgm 3 in 1997 2018 and from 346 to 378 kgm 3 in the case of irenebreen in 2002 2018 fig 9 a table 4 the density was correlated with the selected meteorological parameters the highest correlation was found with the highest precipitation total in the period when air temperature exceeded 0 5 c on waldemarbreen the snow density was best correlated statistically significantly with ros in the case of heavy ros events and precipitation all above 15 mm r 0 83 p 0 001 and those above 10 mm r 0 66 p 0 027 fig 9b on irenebreen it was for all above 5 mm r 0 97 p 0 000 and those above 10 mm r 0 90 p 0 006 fig 9c on waldemarbreen the highest number of ice layers were found in 2018 10 whereas in 1997 there were none observed the greatest total thickness of ice layers 32 and 21 cm was recorded in 2008 and 2018 respectively fig 10 on irenebreen on the other hand the greatest number of ice layers were found in 2018 8 and the greatest total thickness of those layers 24 and 11 cm was recorded in 2018 and 2007 respectively 5 discussion based on the analysis of meteorological data for nw spitsbergen positive trends in the values of individual climate characteristics were observed table 2 in the years 1976 2018 the number of days with precipitation from november to april increased and the trend reached 0 362 mm a 1 and was statistically significant in the same period the mean air temperature increased 0 135 ca 1 similar directions of changes were observed for the last two decades and the extent of those changes was even greater all of that contributed to the increase in the number size and frequency of ros events considering the influence of ros events on the polar environment and on the characteristics of the snow cover it is particularly important to note that in recent years the number of days with heavy ros events mainly over 15 mm but also under 15 mm have been on the increase fig 5 a similar increase in occurrence of extreme winter ros events has been described by langlois et al 2017 rennert et al 2009 found that the frequency of warm spells and heavy ros events in the arctic is increasing and is expected to increase further during the 21st century hansen et al 2014 noted that in svalbard extreme warm spells and heavy ros events in winter are already more frequent łupikasza et al 2019 also found an increase in frequency of winter rainfall october may in the southern part of svalbard between 1978 and 2017 particularly in october and november graham et al 2017 confirmed the rise in winter air temperature since about 1980 for the whole arctic ocean but some isolated warm winters in the arctic can be traced back to the times of the fram expedition in 1896 additionally snow cover is disappearing at ever earlier dates fig 6 the increasingly frequent and intense episodes of warm spells and liquid precipitation in winter cause changes in the properties of the snow cover on glaciers the changes manifest themselves mainly in the formation of ice layers on the kaffiøyra glaciers ice layers were observed in almost every winter season the number of warm spells in winter essentially matched the number of ice layers on the glaciers which was described by sobota 2017 moreover in 1997 2018 on waldemarbreen the number of ice layers and their thickness were both observed to increase this is a consequence of a greater number of days with positive temperatures and coinciding precipitation often exceeding 10 55 mm per day the mean thickness of the ice layers on the glaciers is not as great as the ice covers formed in their forefields and on the kaffiøyra plain during the entire period of observations the thickness of the ice layers on waldemarbreen ranged from 1 to 30 cm and from 1 to 20 cm on irenebreen although the maximum values occurred only once in the other winter seasons the thickness normally ranged from 1 to 4 cm which are lower values than those measured in the tundra on the kaffiøyra i e 5 5 to 13 cm according to hansen et al 2011 the total precipitation at the time of positive diurnal air temperature in winter has the greatest influence on the snow density this correlation was strong on waldemarbreen r 0 71 p 0 015 and very strong on irenebreen r 0 97 p 0 000 this shows that on the one hand percolating and freezing water increases the density of thinner snow covers but on the other hand an ice layer may protect the snow cover from the load of any overlying snow as a buffer zone separating the cover from the load of top snow layers especially in the initial phase of its duration and thus the mean snow density in a profile may be changed it was observed that as the number of ros events increased on waldemarbreen and irenebreen the snow density decreased considering the meteorological elements that favour the occurrence of ros events the number of ice layers on waldemarbreen was found to be best correlated with pdnp t 0 5 and pdd a similar relationship was observed for irenebreen the number of ice layers on waldemarbreen was best correlated with ros events 15 mm r 0 67 p 0 043 fig 11 the total thickness of ice layers was best correlated with ros events in the case of heavy ros events and especially precipitation above 20 mm the correlation coefficient reached 0 77 p 0 015 this means that positive air temperature in winter months and coinciding precipitation have the greatest influence on the formation of ice layers the same meteorological parameters affect the thickness of the ice layers on the glaciers the number of ice layers and their thickness both increase with the number of ros events on the glaciers in the case of waldemarbreen the development of snowpack was clearly affected by winter precipitation on days with positive air temperature łupikasza et al 2019 also found an increase in the frequency of winter rain in hornsund in south svalbard and that these events impact both glacier mass balance and glacier dynamics no evident relationship was found between wintertime thaw and ros events and the mass balance of the glaciers of kaffiøyra but the balance of these small glaciers is influenced by more than winter snow accumulation namely by the summer ablation summer balance of the glacier this is all the more true for the fact that in recent years summer ablation of the analysed glaciers has been exceptionally big sobota et al 2016a an increase in air temperature and the number of ros events including heavy ros events which in turn influence the characteristics of the snow cover its thickness which then influences the mass balance furthermore it has recently been noted that the beginning of snow cover melt on the glaciers is earlier than it was in the 1970 s and 1980 s fig 6 ros events increase the snowpack hardness by creating ice layers in the snow by refreezing rain water the increased hardness will decrease the potential of wind erosion and change the albedo density and conductivity of the snowpack and such affects the energy transfer through the snowpack conway and benedict 1994 noted that the downward penetration of water in a snowpack is impeded by buried hard snow and ice layers thaw induced ice layers in glacier snow cover may play a vital role in shaping the snow properties and its blowing off as well as its density which is significant for the water equivalent furthermore the ice layers form a protection against wind which may contribute to the spatial diversity of the snow thickness within the glacier consequently the snow cover thickness undergoes changes too a similar increase in ros events even in mid winter was also described including its role in the reduction of snow accumulation for the bayelva watershed svalbard kongsfjorden nowak and hodson 2013 warm spells in winter and increasingly frequent ros events affect the characteristics of the snow cover by increasing the number of ice layers which can influence snow accumulation and its properties 6 conclusions contemporary changes in climate lead to an increased frequency of rain on snow events including heavy ros events in the kaffiøyra region which affects the development of snow cover properties an increase in the positive degree days sum has been observed especially since the early 21st century warm spells in winter and the increasing number of ros events affect the characteristics of snow cover mainly by increasing the number of ice layers which may determine snow accumulation and density as well as its spatial distribution the increase in ros events is accompanied by a decrease in snow density on glaciers the ros events affect the number of ice layers whereas heavy ros events contribute to the formation of ice layers of greater thickness ice layers also make a valid indicator of ros events ros events may also have an indirect influence on glacier mass balance through changes in the properties of the snow cover yet in the case of small glaciers on nw spitsbergen in recent years the mass balance has been determined mainly by substantial summer ablation therefore there is not necessarily a direct correlation between mass glacier balance and the number of ros events at all times changes in the cryosphere are presently occurring on a number of levels such phenomena as ros events significantly shape the contemporary environment they also affect changes in the properties and thickness of snow cover one of the most dramatic consequences of such changes is

5177,the earth is gradually turning green due to afforestation especially in china because the carbon cycle is driven by the groundwater cycle in karstification the process of water carbon coupling cycle pwcc in karst forest area can not only promote vegetation growth but also enhance chemical weathering processes of carbonate rocks to absorb more co2 therefore carbon sequestration can occur during the process of ecological restoration in karst areas however forest respiration also increases with the vegetation growth which can produce extra co2 back to atmosphere to study the promotion function of forest vegetation during different succession stages on the pwcc in karst critical zone three karst groundwater systems with different vegetation coverages a native forest a secondary forest during reforestation and a crop area in rural land are chosen in southwest china their long term monitoring of indicators including precipitation p partial pressure of air co2 p co 2 groundwater discharge q hydrochemical and isotope components was conducted the results indicated that part of co2 produced by forest respiration diffuses into the atmosphere as a carbon source and the remaining dissolves into the groundwater thereby increasing corrodibility the carbon sequestration mechanism differs at different vegetation succession stages the secondary forest development stage displays an obvious carbon sequestration effect during the process of rocky desertification control when the succession stage approaches the top level ecosystem the carbon sequestration effect descend sharply until the net carbon sequestration can be ignored keywords water carbon coupling cycle karst critical zone forest vegetation effect rocky desertification control southwest china 1 introduction according to data released by the american national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa in may 2019 the average global co2 concentration in the atmosphere had reached as high as 411 13 ppm dlugokencky and tans 2020 a 41 increase from 1990 and a 46 increase from 1750 it is generally accepted that vegetation is very important for carbon sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems rastetter et al 1991 karst vegetation dynamics depend more on precipitation than temperature zhao et al 2020 the critical zone extends from the top of the vegetative canopy through the soil and down to fresh bedrock and the bottom of the groundwater brantley et al 2017 the karst critical zone was defined to include boundary layer atmosphere above ground vegetation surface soil subsurface cave and limestone bedrock wang et al 2020 carbon and water exchange occur at the interface among the different phases of the karst critical zone growing forest vegetation is needed to absorb co2 from the atmosphere and global secondary succession forest vegetation will be an important carbon sequestration chazdon et al 2016 the terrestrial biosphere has acted as a sink for atmospheric co2 removing on average approximately 2 5 petagrams of carbon per year during 1993 2013 liu et al 2015 an increase in atmospheric co2 content can improve the efficiency of photosynthesis studies have shown that the accumulation rate of atmospheric co2 decreased by approximately 2 2 each year from 2002 to 2014 keenan et al 2016 the positive succession process of forest vegetation can also significantly increase soil carbon stability wang et al 2016 therefore soil organic carbon reserves in forest regions are significantly higher than those in cultivated lands hu et al 2018 with recent continuous afforestation activities the development trend of karst desertification in southwest china has been effectively curbed as reported by the state forestry administration of china in 2018 a study of american national aeronautics and space administration also showed that the earth is gradually turning green under the influence of afforestation especially in china chen et al 2019 the carbon cycle in karst ecosystem is complex compared to other terrestrial ecosystems karstification is an important part of the global carbon cycle with the carbon cycle process driven by the groundwater cycle yuan 1993 1995 1997 several studies have shown that most of the carbon transported from mainland to ocean originates from the karstification process blum et al 1998 gao et al 2009 jacobson et al 2002 and karst carbon sequestration flux primarily depends on karst water runoff flux kang et al 2011 in karst areas the special hydrological effect of vegetation may enhance the precipitation and runoff process of karst drainage basins mcculloch and robinson 1993 the increased rainfall can in turn promote dissolution of carbonate rocks goddéris et al 2013 therefore the vegetation growth process has a carbon sequestration effect on the atmosphere based on the above understanding there should be a loss of co2 in the atmosphere near karst forest areas compared to regions with less vegetation or karst rocky desertification however according to long term monitoring data the partial pressure of co2 p co 2 near the ground surface of remote native forests is significantly higher than that in other places some studies have suggested that soil respiration is gradually strengthened during the positive succession process of forest vegetation zdanowicz et al 2017 the co2 from vegetation respiration and microorganisms is released into the atmosphere as a carbon source therefore the effect of humid subtropical forest carbon sources of respiration should not be underestimated griffin et al 2017 a hot and humid environment is conducive to both plant growth and ecosystem respiration which can offset a portion of the net carbon sequestration yan et al 2013 it is inferred that the trend of the forest carbon accumulation rate increases rapidly and then slowly with forest age meng et al 2018 some scientists thus believe that relying on trees to mitigate climate change is not a good long term strategy burgermeister 2007 the above research results indicate that there is a special process of a water carbon coupling cycle pwcc in karst forest areas to study the promotion function of vegetation in different succession stages on the pwcc three karst groundwater systems in the karst region of southwest china with different vegetation coverages were chosen as study sites in previous works one is a remote native forest one and the other a secondary forest field work such as the long term monitoring of precipitation co2 partial pressure p co 2 hydro chemical and isotope composition was carried out during 2010 to 2015 kang 2012 kang and he 2011 kang et al 2015 to better understand mechanisms of pwcc some works of a groundwater system in a crop land in rural area in 2015 2016 was supplemented to make a comparison 2 study sites the three study sites are located in the subtropical monsoon climate zone of china characterized by high temperature high rainfall intensity and high

410 and 740 m the strata consist primarily of lower middle devonian dolomite and limestone before the 1950 s because of firewood harvesting karst desertification was very serious in the nongla area

high population density the vegetation is scarce on the mountain and is dominated by shrubs the groundwater is discharged by a decentralized flow because of the weak karst development in the area

forestland range is much higher than that in grassland 4 2 nongla epi karst spring system a total of 33 groundwater samples were collected monthly in the nongla epi karst spring s08 in r2 from may 2012 to december 2015 table 5 the dominant cation of spring water is ca2 and mg2 and the dominant anion is hco3 according to stoichiometric analyses the groundwater can be characterized as an hco3 ca

suffers sulfuric acid and nitric acid rain the meteoric water samples show they contain high concentrations of sulfate and nitrate so ph values of meteoric water range from 4 84 to 7 32 and most of those are below 7 0 5 discussion 5 1 hydrological and climatic effects of forest vegetation 5 1 1 climatic effects of forest vegetation forests recharge atmospheric moisture by evapo transpiration and release the biological particles into the atmosphere which include fungal spores pollen bacterial cells and biological debris ellison et al 2017 these are all necessary to produce precipitation it was discovered that the precipitation of the maolan karst forest was abundant significantly than other places as early as 1984 the estimated precipitation induced by the forest accounts for 22 45 of the annual precipitation zhou 1987 based on the precipitation data provided by china meteorological data service center cmdc the amount of precipitation around the area of maolan karst forest was between 1050 mm and 1250 mm in 2010 fig 2 however the precipitation which took place inside maolan karst forest was up to 1710 0 mm according to the monitoring data of banzhai monitoring station in the same year heavy precipitation was verified in the forest inner area but the scope of influence was restricted in the forest area 5 1 2 karst water circulation in the forest region in 2010 precipitation mainly occured during may to september and less rainfall in other months the δd and δ 18o of the karst water was decreased from may to september gradually and then increased from september to december fig 3 the lightest value of δd and δ 18o occurred in september and even a negative drift phenomenon occurred compared to the local meteoric water line kang 2012 according to the hydrogeological conditions of the maolan karst forest there were no other factors causing the negative drift of δd and δ 18o except the pericipitation formed by forest evapo transpiration clark and fritz 1997 ingraham and matthews 1988 lauriol and clark 1993 liu et al 2005 sofer and gat 1975 it is well known that the rainwater can be regulated and stored by forest vegetation before infiltrates into groundwater aquifers during the growing season of forest vegetation karst groundwater be absorbed by trees rong et al 2012 then enter atmosphere via evapo transpiration jasechko et al 2013 martinelli et al 1996 during this process stable isotope fractionation may occur the heavy isotopes lose in the moisture and relatively be concentrated in the groundwater therefore when the moisture with lighter isotopes condenses to form precipitation there are lighter isotopes in the groundwater when it is recharged wu et al 2015 the peak value of precipitation appeared in june and the minimum value of the δd and δ 18o in the groundwater occurred in september 2010 in conclusion the lag time between groundwater recharge and discharge was two to three months 5 2 regulatory role of vegetation in the karst water cycle 5 2 1 seasonal hydrochemical dynamics of the epi karst spring water although plantation of trees increase evapo transpiration decrease surface runoff allen and chapman 2001 and groundwater recharge benyon et al 2006 huang et al 2020 vegetation coverage is crucial in regulating and storing groundwater influenced by deforestation nongla epi karst spring was a seasonal spring which completely dried out in the winters between the 1960 s to the 1970 s however it turned into a normal flow spring at the late 1980 s because of trees replanting the dynamic variation of karst water chemistry is controlled by the co2 effect and the dilution effect liu et al 2007 the primary chemical constituents of the nongla epi karst spring revealed a periodic variation during the entire year corresponding to the precipitation and biological growth period fig 4 for example the fast growing season of forest is from april to october in the southwest of china tu et al 2017 xu et al 2017 during the period the respiration of vegetation roots and microorganisms increase the partial pressure of co2 in the soil atmosphere to enhance the weathering of carbonate rocks as a result the concentrations of the primary chemical constituents in the karst water were generally higher during this time from november to march in next year precipitation was less temperatures was lower the growth of forest vegetation was slower as well hence there were comparatively lower concentrations of chemical constituents in the karst water 5 2 2 variation trend of epi karst water quality at a multi year scale based on the long term monitoring data the major ions of epi karst water increased gradually table 8 however with the improvement of forest vegetation coverage conditions the concentration of the primary hydro chemical constituents in the surface karst water demonstrated a significant increasing trend compared to previous studies at nongla eip karst spring deng et al 2007 li et al 2006 the growth rate of the ca2 mg2 and hco3 concentrations was 9 05 16 68 and 15 66 respectively over a period of approximate a decade the cl in the karst groundwater primarily originates from man made pollutants and its concentration has decreased sharply by 47 62 over nearly a decade the concentration of so4 2 was low but the level increased rapidly which probably because of the effect of acid rain the table above illustrate the positive correlation between vegetation succession and karstification this conclusion is certified by the results of dissolution rate monitoring zhang 2011 zhang et al 2006 and monitoring result on co2 concentration in soil atmosphere cao et al 2011 therefore with the process of rocky desertification control the karst geological carbon sequestration is increasing obviously 5 3 carbon source and carbon sequestration functions of forest vegetation the forest vegetation carbon sequestration means atmospheric co2 can be absorbed through photosynthesis however it also release co2 back to the atmosphere by respiration moreover decayed branches and leaves would discharge co2 after be decomposed by microorganisms therefore in a sense forests can also be the one of carbon sources of the atmosphere 5 3 1 carbon source functions of forest vegetation and soil respiration the production of co2 in soils mostly depends on the level of microbial activities and root respiration romero mujalli et al 2019 so the surface temperature and soil water content are the typical parameters for representing soil respiration rates sullivan et al 2019 in maolan karst forest soil layer is thin and only be continuously distributed at the bottom of the karst depression however there is a thick litter layer under the trees which always moist because of its productive of precipitation regulating effect therefore intense microbial respiration exists in this layer due to its abundant porosity and good connectivity with the free air outside the co2 generated by respiration can always be released into the atmosphere near the surface the p c o 2 of soil atmosphere is much greater than that of the free air near the subsurface in maolan karst forest which is much greater than the global atmospheric concentration already this indicates that microbial respiration in the soil and litter layer release co2 into the air near the surface acting as one of significant carbon source 5 3 2 carbon sequestration estimation from forest vegetation photosynthesis with continuous tree planting since 1964 a secondary forest dominated by evergreen broad leaved trees has formed since the 1980 s in the nongla area at present most of these trees are higher than ten meters with a diameter of more than 15 0 cm the vegetation coverage rate in this region achieve as high as 95 according to the report in 2003 the biomass growth of secondary forests in the nongla area was nearly 1 0 m3 a km2 deng 2003 based on the reaction equation equation 1 of photosynthesis 0 4 tc of carbon sequestration can be formed for every 1 0 t of c6h12o6 generated 6 co 2 6 h 2 o c 6 h 12 o 6 6 o 2 the average dry density of wood is approximately 0 6 t m3 therefore the carbon sequestration of the forest in the nongla secondary forest region is about 0 24 tc km2 a the forests in this area are still in the stage of positive succession and the stocks of forest is far from the balance so this value can be considered as the net carbon sequestration approximately however the remote native forest in the maolan karst forest is on the top level ecosystem in the karst area with a constant biomass growth rate and a nearly equilibrium amount of total biological capacity zhu 1993 most trees in this area are more than 100 years old the average standing stock volume in the forest region was maintained at approximately 7500 m3 km2 for a long period zhou 1987 due to there is not interference from artificial logging in the maolan karst forest the increment of forest vegetation accumulation is roughly equal to the natural consumption more succinctly this condition makes it difficult to produce net carbon sequestration for the atmosphere there in conclusion forest vegetation form carbon sequestration only under the process of positive succession therefore the secondary forest development stage display an obvious carbon sequestration effect during the process of rocky desertification control when the succession stage approaches the top level ecosystem the carbon sequestration effect descends sharply until the net carbon sequestration can be ignored 5 4 vegetation regulation of karst carbon sequestration based on the concept of different geologic materials are generally characterized by different isotopic compositions stable carbon isotope is useful indicator in the field of dic sources in groundwater systems li et al 2005 there are two mainly sources of dic carbon in karst water equation 2 and equation 3 half of carbon is from carbonate rocks and the other half is from atmosphere bögli 1980 buhmann and dreybrodt 1985a 1985b dreybrodt 1980 1981 co 2 h 2 o hco 3 h caco 3 h hco 3 ca 2 previous studies refered that the δ 13 c c a c o 3 between 0 and 2 0 drever 1997 indicating co2 mainly originates from root respiration and decayed organic matter in the soil layer values of δ13c of this co2 range from 29 to 20 with average value around 24 to 23 mook 1986 based on the understanding above some researchers have proposed that due to the abundant vegetation coverage the prediction value of δ13cdic for karst water in the marine carbonate distribution area should be around 11 grootes et al 1969 mook 1986 the source of atmospheric co2 which takes part in the karstification process in forested areas originates from respiration primarily the range of δ13c values of soil co2 in maolan karst forest is from 40 to 23 the average value is 27 this result was more negative compared to the values from mook 1986 all of the δ13cdic in the karst water were less than 11 kang and he 2011 the statistical value was 14 18 1 64 in the maolan karst forest table 2 due to the influence of human activities acid rain occur frequently in liuzhou city the ph values of groundwater ranges from 4 84 to 7 32 which lower than the same indicator in maolan karst forest in general table 7 low ph water is more beneficial to the carbonate weathering in addition due to the fertilization in liuzhou rural area which make the concentration of no3 ranges from 3 72 to 78 70 mg l studies manifested that in decentralized flow system of liuzhou the polluted groundwater generally has high ratios of cl na david 2013 groundwater has cl na ratios ranges from 0 30 to 2 90 indicating that no anthropogenic input was released into groundwater systems the acid rain and commercial fertilizer are the main contaminants sources of groundwater the h from acid rain and nitrification processes affect carbonate weathering which results in carbon isotopic signature similar to carbonate rock yue et al 2015 the values of δ13cdic in the liuzhou rural land was between 8 and 10 and the average value was 9 08 4 70 table 6 this indicates that carbon stable isotope is lighter in maolan karst forest compared with liuzhou rural land therefore with adequate forest coverage not only the values are more negative but also more concentrated in the spectrum figs 5 and 6 the result indicates that the forest plays a crucial role in the water carbon coupling cycle in karst areas 6 conclusions in this study the dynamic variations in the primary indices for different groundwater systems in karst critical zone were analyzed it is indicated that forests contribute to the intensification of precipitation the precipitation in a forest region is significantly higher than the forest outside there is a water carbon coupling cycle in karst forest regions which can promote the growth of forest vegetation itself the karst carbon cycle and the carbon sequestration forest respiration can produce a large amount of co2 a portion of which diffuses into the atmosphere as a carbon source and the other portion dissolves into groundwater causing an increasing corrodibility the carbon sequestration mechanism is diverse at the different succession stages of karst forest vegetation during the early stage the carbon sequestration is dominated by biological carbon sequestration with an increasing in biomass during the process of positive succession to a mature forest system the biological carbon sequestration would be weakened due to the accumulation rate slows down but the geological carbon sequestration would expand gradually at the mature forest stage the net carbon sequestration which generated by biological carbon sequestration is limited and dominated by geological carbon sequestration credit authorship contribution statement zhiqiang kang conceptualization methodology formal

5177,the earth is gradually turning green due to afforestation especially in china because the carbon cycle is driven by the groundwater cycle in karstification the process of water carbon coupling cycle pwcc in karst forest area can not only promote vegetation growth but also enhance chemical weathering processes of carbonate rocks to absorb more co2 therefore carbon sequestration can occur

according to data released by the american national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa in may 2019 the average global co2 concentration in the atmosphere had reached as high as 411 13 ppm dlugokencky and tans 2020 a 41 increase from 1990 and a 46 increase from 1750 it is generally accepted that vegetation is very important for carbon sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems rastetter et al 1991 karst vegetation dynamics depend more on precipitation than temperature zhao et al 2020 the critical zone extends from the top of the vegetative canopy through the soil and down to fresh bedrock and the bottom of the groundwater brantley et al 2017 the karst critical zone was defined to include boundary layer atmosphere above ground vegetation surface soil subsurface cave and limestone bedrock wang et al 2020 carbon and water exchange occur at the interface among the different phases of the karst critical zone growing forest vegetation is needed to absorb co2 from the atmosphere and global secondary succession forest vegetation will be an important carbon sequestration chazdon et al 2016 the terrestrial biosphere has acted as a sink for atmospheric co2 removing on average approximately 2 5 petagrams of carbon per year during 1993 2013 liu et al 2015 an increase in atmospheric co2 content can improve the efficiency of photosynthesis studies have shown that the accumulation rate of atmospheric co2 decreased by approximately 2 2 each year from 2002 to 2014 keenan et al 2016 the positive succession process of forest vegetation can also significantly increase soil carbon stability wang et al 2016 therefore soil organic carbon reserves in forest regions are significantly higher than those in cultivated lands hu et al 2018 with recent continuous afforestation activities the development trend of karst desertification in southwest china has been effectively curbed as reported by the state forestry administration of china in 2018 a study of american national aeronautics and space administration also showed that the earth is gradually turning green under the influence of afforestation especially in china chen et al 2019 the carbon cycle in karst ecosystem is complex compared to other terrestrial ecosystems karstification is an important part of the global carbon cycle with the carbon cycle process driven by the groundwater cycle yuan 1993 1995 1997 several studies have shown that most of the carbon transported from mainland to ocean originates from the karstification process blum et al 1998 gao et al 2009 jacobson et al 2002 and karst carbon sequestration flux primarily depends on karst water runoff flux kang et al 2011 in karst areas the special hydrological effect of vegetation may enhance the precipitation and runoff process of karst drainage basins mcculloch and robinson 1993 the increased rainfall can in turn promote dissolution of carbonate rocks goddéris et al 2013 therefore the vegetation growth process has a carbon sequestration effect on the atmosphere based on the above understanding there should be a loss of co2 in the atmosphere near karst forest areas compared to regions with less vegetation or karst rocky desertification however according to long term monitoring data the partial pressure of co2 p co 2 near the ground surface of remote native forests is significantly higher than that in other places some studies have suggested that soil respiration is gradually strengthened during the positive succession process of forest vegetation zdanowicz et al 2017 the co2 from vegetation respiration and microorganisms is released into the atmosphere as a carbon source therefore the effect of humid subtropical forest carbon sources of respiration should not be underestimated griffin et al 2017 a hot and humid environment is conducive to both plant growth and ecosystem respiration which can offset a portion of the net carbon sequestration yan et al 2013 it is inferred that the trend of the forest carbon accumulation rate increases rapidly and then slowly with forest age meng et al 2018 some scientists thus believe that relying on trees to mitigate climate change is not a good long term

vegetation in different succession stages on the pwcc three karst groundwater systems in the karst region of southwest china with different vegetation coverages were chosen as study sites in previous

supplemented to make a comparison 2 study sites the three study sites are located in the subtropical monsoon climate zone of china characterized by high temperature high rainfall intensity and high humidity but with different vegetation coverage conditions table 1 the maolan karst forest is a remote native forest coverage area in the southeast guizhou province whose acreage is more than 200 km2 with a forest coverage rate of over 90 percent the strata consist primarily of middle carboniferous limestone and dolomite the landform is dominated by a peak cluster depression and valley and the elevation in the bottom of depression is between 450 and 1010 m the maolan karst forest is in a native state with a low population density and little interference from mankind in 2010 seven

suffers sulfuric acid and nitric acid rain the meteoric water samples show they contain high concentrations of sulfate and nitrate so ph values of meteoric water range from 4 84 to 7 32 and most of those are below 7 0 5 discussion 5 1 hydrological and climatic effects of forest vegetation 5 1 1 climatic effects of forest vegetation forests recharge atmospheric moisture by evapo transpiration and release the biological particles into the atmosphere which include fungal spores pollen bacterial cells and biological debris ellison et al 2017 these are all necessary to produce precipitation it was discovered that the precipitation of the maolan karst forest was abundant significantly than other places as early as 1984 the estimated precipitation induced by the forest accounts for 22 45 of the annual precipitation zhou 1987 based on the precipitation data provided by china meteorological data service center cmdc the amount of precipitation around the area of maolan karst forest was between 1050 mm and 1250 mm in 2010 fig 2 however the precipitation which took place inside maolan karst forest was up to 1710 0 mm according to the monitoring data of banzhai monitoring station in the same year heavy precipitation was verified in the forest inner area but the scope of influence was restricted in the forest area 5 1 2 karst water circulation in the forest region in 2010 precipitation mainly occured during may to september and less rainfall in other months the δd and δ 18o of the karst water was decreased from may to september gradually and then increased from september to december fig 3 the lightest value of δd and δ 18o occurred in september and even a negative drift phenomenon occurred compared to the local meteoric water line kang 2012 according to the hydrogeological conditions of the maolan karst forest there were no other factors causing the negative drift of δd and δ 18o except the pericipitation formed by forest evapo transpiration clark and fritz 1997 ingraham and matthews 1988 lauriol and clark 1993 liu et al 2005 sofer and gat 1975 it is well known that the rainwater can be regulated and stored by forest vegetation before infiltrates into groundwater aquifers during the growing season of forest vegetation karst groundwater be absorbed by trees rong et al 2012 then enter atmosphere via evapo transpiration jasechko et al 2013 martinelli et al 1996 during this process stable isotope fractionation may occur the heavy isotopes lose in the moisture and relatively be concentrated in the groundwater therefore when the moisture with lighter isotopes condenses to form precipitation there are lighter isotopes in the groundwater when it is recharged wu et al 2015 the peak value of precipitation appeared in june and the minimum value of the δd and δ 18o in the groundwater occurred in september 2010 in conclusion the lag time between groundwater recharge and discharge was two to three months 5 2 regulatory role of vegetation in the karst water cycle 5 2 1 seasonal hydrochemical dynamics of the epi karst spring water although plantation of trees increase evapo transpiration decrease surface runoff allen and chapman 2001 and groundwater recharge benyon et al 2006 huang et al 2020 vegetation coverage is crucial in regulating and storing groundwater influenced by deforestation nongla epi karst spring was a seasonal spring which completely dried out in the winters between the 1960 s to the 1970 s however it turned into a normal flow spring at the late 1980 s because of trees replanting the dynamic variation of karst water chemistry is controlled by the co2 effect and the dilution effect liu et al 2007 the primary chemical constituents of the nongla epi karst spring revealed a periodic variation during the entire year corresponding to the precipitation and biological growth period fig 4 for example the fast growing season of forest is from april to october in the southwest of china tu et al 2017 xu et al 2017 during the period the respiration of vegetation roots and microorganisms increase the partial pressure of co2 in the soil atmosphere to enhance the weathering of carbonate rocks as a result the concentrations of the primary chemical constituents in the karst water were generally higher during this time from november to march in next year precipitation was less temperatures was lower the growth of forest vegetation was slower as well hence there were comparatively lower concentrations of chemical constituents in the karst water 5 2 2 variation trend of epi karst water quality at a multi year scale based on the long term monitoring data the major ions of epi karst water increased gradually table 8 however with the improvement of forest vegetation coverage conditions the concentration of the primary hydro chemical constituents in the surface karst water demonstrated a significant increasing trend compared to previous studies at nongla eip karst spring deng et al 2007 li et al 2006 the growth rate of the ca2 mg2 and hco3 concentrations was 9 05 16 68 and 15 66 respectively over a period of approximate a decade the cl in the karst groundwater primarily originates from man made pollutants and its concentration has decreased sharply by 47 62 over nearly a decade the concentration of so4 2 was low but the level increased rapidly which probably because of the effect of acid rain the table above illustrate the positive correlation between vegetation succession and karstification this conclusion is certified by the results of dissolution rate monitoring zhang 2011 zhang et al 2006 and monitoring result on co2 concentration in soil atmosphere cao et al 2011 therefore with the process of rocky desertification control the karst geological carbon sequestration is increasing obviously 5 3 carbon source and carbon sequestration functions of forest vegetation the forest vegetation carbon sequestration means atmospheric co2 can be absorbed through photosynthesis however it also release co2 back to the atmosphere by respiration moreover decayed branches and leaves would discharge co2 after be decomposed by microorganisms therefore in a sense forests can also be the one of carbon sources of the atmosphere 5 3 1 carbon source functions of forest vegetation and soil respiration the production of co2 in soils mostly depends on the level of microbial activities and root respiration romero mujalli et al 2019 so the surface temperature and soil water content are the typical parameters for representing soil respiration rates sullivan et al 2019 in maolan karst forest soil layer is thin and only be continuously distributed at the bottom of the karst depression however there is a thick litter layer under the trees which always moist because of its productive of precipitation regulating effect therefore intense microbial respiration exists in this layer due to its abundant porosity and good connectivity with the free air outside the co2 generated by respiration can always be released into the atmosphere near the surface the p c o 2 of soil atmosphere is much greater than that of the free air near the subsurface in maolan karst forest which is much greater than the global atmospheric concentration already this indicates that microbial respiration in the soil and litter layer release co2 into the air near the surface acting as one of significant carbon source 5 3 2 carbon sequestration estimation from forest vegetation photosynthesis with continuous tree planting since 1964 a secondary forest dominated by evergreen broad leaved trees has formed since the 1980 s in the nongla area at present most of these trees are higher than ten meters with a diameter of more than 15 0 cm the vegetation coverage rate in this region achieve as high as 95 according to the report in 2003 the biomass growth of secondary forests in the nongla area was nearly 1 0 m3 a km2 deng 2003 based on the reaction equation equation 1 of photosynthesis 0 4 tc of carbon sequestration can be formed for every 1 0 t of c6h12o6 generated 6 co 2 6 h 2 o c 6 h 12 o 6 6 o 2 the average dry density of wood is approximately 0 6 t m3 therefore the carbon sequestration of the forest in the nongla secondary forest region is about 0 24 tc km2 a the forests in this area are still in the stage of positive succession and the stocks of forest is far from the balance so this value can be considered as the net carbon sequestration approximately however the remote native forest in the maolan karst forest is on the top level ecosystem in the karst area with a constant biomass growth rate and a nearly equilibrium amount of total biological capacity zhu 1993 most trees in this area are more than 100 years old the average standing stock volume in the forest region was maintained at approximately 7500 m3 km2 for a long period zhou 1987 due to there is not interference from artificial logging in the maolan karst forest the increment of forest vegetation accumulation is roughly equal to the natural consumption more succinctly this condition makes it difficult to produce net carbon sequestration for the atmosphere there in conclusion forest vegetation form carbon sequestration only under the process of positive succession therefore the secondary forest development stage display an obvious carbon sequestration effect during the process of rocky desertification control when the succession stage approaches the top level ecosystem the carbon sequestration effect descends sharply until the net carbon sequestration can be ignored 5 4 vegetation regulation of karst carbon sequestration based on the concept of different geologic materials are generally characterized by different isotopic compositions stable carbon isotope is useful indicator in the field of dic sources in groundwater systems li et al 2005 there are two mainly sources of dic carbon in karst water equation 2 and equation 3 half of carbon is from carbonate rocks and the other half is from atmosphere bögli 1980 buhmann and dreybrodt 1985a 1985b dreybrodt 1980 1981 co 2 h 2 o hco 3 h caco 3 h hco 3 ca 2 previous studies refered that the δ 13 c c a c o 3 between 0 and 2 0 drever 1997 indicating co2 mainly originates from root respiration and decayed organic matter in the soil layer values of δ13c of this co2 range from 29 to 20 with average value around 24 to 23 mook 1986 based on the understanding above some researchers have proposed that due to the abundant vegetation coverage the prediction value of δ13cdic for karst water in the marine carbonate distribution area should be around 11 grootes et al 1969 mook 1986 the source of atmospheric co2 which takes part in the karstification process in forested areas originates from respiration primarily the range of δ13c values of soil co2 in maolan karst forest is from 40 to 23 the average value is 27 this result was more negative compared to the values from mook 1986 all of the δ13cdic in the karst water were less than 11 kang and he 2011 the statistical value was 14 18 1 64 in the maolan karst forest table 2 due to the influence of human activities acid rain occur frequently in liuzhou city the ph values of groundwater ranges from 4 84 to 7 32 which lower than the same indicator in maolan karst forest in general table 7 low ph water is more beneficial to the carbonate weathering in addition due to the fertilization in liuzhou rural area which make the concentration of no3 ranges from 3 72 to 78 70 mg l studies manifested that in decentralized flow system of liuzhou the polluted groundwater generally has high ratios of cl na david 2013 groundwater has cl na ratios ranges from 0 30 to 2 90 indicating that no anthropogenic input was released into groundwater systems the acid rain and commercial fertilizer are the main contaminants sources of groundwater the h from acid rain and nitrification processes affect carbonate weathering which results in carbon isotopic signature similar to carbonate rock yue et al 2015 the values of δ13cdic in the liuzhou rural land was between 8 and 10 and the average value was 9 08 4 70 table 6 this indicates that carbon stable isotope is lighter in maolan karst forest compared with liuzhou rural land therefore with adequate forest coverage not only the values are more negative but also more concentrated in the spectrum figs 5 and 6 the result indicates that the forest plays a crucial role in the water carbon coupling cycle in karst areas 6 conclusions in this study the dynamic variations in the primary indices for different groundwater systems in karst critical zone were analyzed it is indicated that forests contribute to the intensification of precipitation the precipitation in a forest region is significantly higher than the forest outside there is a water carbon coupling cycle in karst forest regions which can promote the growth of forest vegetation itself the karst carbon cycle and the carbon sequestration forest respiration can produce a large amount of co2 a portion of which diffuses into the atmosphere as a carbon source and the other portion dissolves into groundwater causing an increasing corrodibility the carbon sequestration mechanism is diverse at the different succession stages of karst forest vegetation during the early stage the carbon sequestration is dominated by biological carbon sequestration with an increasing in biomass during the process of positive succession to a mature forest system the biological carbon sequestration would be weakened due to the accumulation rate slows down but the geological carbon sequestration would expand gradually at the mature forest stage the net carbon sequestration which generated by biological carbon sequestration is limited and dominated by geological carbon sequestration credit authorship contribution statement zhiqiang kang conceptualization methodology formal

5178,the aim of this paper is to investigate the complex relationship between monthly water discharge and suspended sediment load using a flexible statistical model i e a gaussian mixture model the theoretical principles of this model and its related expectation maximization e m algorithm are briefly analyzed and subsequently applied to hydrologic data of four medium sized mountainous rivers of the southern balkan peninsula i e acheloos arachthos aoos and aliakmon whose data distribution of the aforementioned variables shows the existence of two sub populations a gaussian mixture model gmm is fitted to the sample points for each river and then its parameters are tuned by comparing different information criteria in order to determine the optimum parameter settings these parameters latent variables are associated with the generation mechanism of the bivariate distribution which alternates between two components regimes related to the seasonality of the hydrological variables the latter being characteristic of the mediterranean environment comprising of a wet and dry intra annual variability of water discharge and suspended sediment load the transitions between the two regimes can be approximated by a markov chain switching regression model which can be used for the estimation of monthly suspended sediment fluxes when the corresponding water discharge is known keywords gaussian mixture models switching regression rating curves probabilistic forecasting mountainous mediterranean rivers 1 introduction the major component of total sediment load transported by mountainous rivers of medium and small size 104 km2 is the suspended load with the other two being the dissolved and bed load milliman and syvitski 1992 poulos and collins 2002 milliman and farnsworth 2011 poulos 2019 on the other hand reliable and long term measurements of suspended sediment load are sparse especially in the case of medium small rivers milliman and farnsworth 2011 this has led to the development of various approaches for predicting the suspended sediment load from the climatic and physicogeographic parameters of river catchments i e water discharge lithology soil type vegetation cover land use climatic conditions elevation slope gradient such as those provided by wischmeier and smith 1978 dissmeyer and foster 1980 probst 1990 moreover due to spatial and temporal variation of the aforementioned physical parameters and their complex relationships estimates of suspended sediment fluxes have been based primarily on their relationship to water discharge which is usually easier to obtain e g walling 1977 koutsogiannis and tarla 1987 milliman and syvitski 1992 poulos et al 1996 poulos and collins 2002 zarris et al 2012 cohen et al 2015 poulos 2019 these estimates have never achieved very strong monthly correlations which is partially due to flow seasonality that depends on the complex physical setting of the river basin milliman and syvitski 1992 poulos et al 1996 this non linear relationship can also be attributed to the nonconformity between the mass of water and transported particles as well as the spatial and time dependent changes of water velocity in the stream in particular scatterplot diagrams of water discharge and suspended sediment fluxes can be described and explained using various controlling factors such as seasonality of fluxes water temperature the lag time of water and sediment hydrograph the hysteretic effect related to rising and falling stage and the variation of tributary inflows e g loughran 1974 walling 1983 williams 1989 sadeghi et al 2008 zhang et al 2018 the most common relationship between water discharge and suspended sediment load called sediment rating curve is a power polynomial sigmoid or inverse function according to walling 1974 ferguson 1986 asselman 2000 syvitski et al 2000 zhang et al 2018 rating curves have been extensively used in the past however correlation is usually poor due to an obvious scatter of sample points of the involved variables i e water discharge and suspended sediment flux making them quite often of no practical use e g walling 1988 asselman 2000 horowitz 2003 to improve the correlation coefficient in such cases an additional grouping of data related to seasons has been proposed in the past walling 1977 mimikou 1982 in order to overcome this problem based on our data disposition and the dominant intra annual climatic variation of the study area gaussian mixture models gmm mclachlan and basford 1988 frühwirth schnatter 2006 have been used these models are constructed using a weighted sum of normal distributions representing sub groups of data points with unique parameters such mixture models have been used in hydrology since 1970 s and progressively evolved to flexible tools for the analysis of different kind of heterogeneous distributions e g frigessi et al 2002 carreau et al 2009 grego and yates 2010 evin et al 2011 yan et al 2017 liu et al 2018 however to our knowledge these models have not been used in the context of the relationship between monthly water discharge and suspended sediments in this paper we explore the complex relation between monthly water discharge and the related suspended sediment fluxes in the case of four mountainous rivers in southern europe balkan peninsula using the analysis of mixture frequency distributions our main objective is to show that the monthly data of the aforementioned variables present patterns expressed by two distinct sub populations and then by fittting a probabilistic function which represents the sum of components of the gaussian distribution to predict suspended sediment load when water discharge is given this new methodology incorporates a better approach of seasonality which in turn could provide more precisely the relationship between monthly water discharge and suspended sediment loads 2 study area 2 1 location geological and geomorphological characteristics the study area is located along the pindus mountain chain in the southwestern part of the balkan peninsula which incorporates large parts of the drainage basins of aliakmon aoos arachthos and acheloos rivers fig 1 the topography of the pindus mountain chain is the result of alpine tectonic neotectonic deformation underhill 1989 karakitsios 2013 and quaternary erosional processes in general in the upper part of these river catchments steep topography prevails and the rivers tend to be braided while the lower parts are characterized by gentle slopes alluvial deposits and meander formations the general geological and geomorphological characteristics for each river are described below aliakmon river located in the northern part of greece is dominated by metamorphic rocks mountrakis 1983 followed by tertiary and quaternary formations and is the longest river in greece while its drainage area stretches over about 8 500 km2 aoos river is situated in northwestern greece flowing from greece towards albania into the adriatic sea the main lithological formations of its watershed are carbonates flysch neogene and quaternary formations aoos river drains a large area greater than 6 800 km2 of which only a small portion belongs to greece arachthos river is situated in the western part of greece it has a drainage area of about 2 000 km2 and flows from pindus mountain range towards the ambracian gulf the drainage basin of arachthos consists of carbonates flysch and quaternary formations acheloos river is one of the principal rivers in greece having a drainage area of 5 638 km2 the main lithological units are carbonates flysch and a few pliocene and alluvial formations lithology plays a key role in the determination of the balance between water discharge and suspended sediments in a river in the study area there are mainly four groups of rocks in the forementioned drainage basins 1 quaternary and neogene formations which are very erodible 2 flysch and molasse formations which are relatively easily eroded 3 metamorphic rocks mainly gneiss and schists but also ophiolites which are characterized by variable resistance to erosion 4 carbonates which being subjected primarily to chemical weathering processes have very small contribution to suspended sediment load 2 2 climate and vegetation the northern part of greece is generally characterized by a temperate type of climate while the presence of pindus mountain range divides the area into two climatic sub regions according to pnevmatikos and katsoulis 2006 i the western side of pindus mountain range extending to the ionian sea with annual mean rainfall between 357 and 1 323 mm year and ii the relatively dry eastern side extending to the aegean sea with annual mean rainfall ranging from 324 to 777 mm year the annual precipitation in western greece is about 1 000 mm near the coastal zone while in the hinterland it is higher exceeding 2 000 mm fotiadi et al 1999 thus the river catchment areas under investigation are subjected to intense seasonal climatic changes with cold wet winters and warm dry summers vegetation in the study area and in more general in greece varies from forest with coniferous trees and prairies in the mountain areas to grazing land and sparse cover in the low land the distribution of the vegetation cover and the temperate mediterranean climatic conditions favors erosional processes although of various intensity according to the spatial variability of the physicogeographic characteristics 2 3 discharge sediment yield water discharge and suspended sediment loads were measured for a long period of time at one gauging station for each river for location see fig 1 a period predating the construction of hydroelectric dams along the course of these rivers which occurred before the 1990s poulos 1999 leontaritis and baltas 2014 these measurements are interrelated to the conditions in the upslope area while for each river the starting year of operation of the gauging station and the duration of measurements in months is presented in table 1 the combined geomorphological and hydrological characteristics for all rivers are demonstrated in table 1 we observe that arachthos river in contrary to having the smallest upslope area demonstrates the highest suspended sediment flux and water discharge between the remaining rivers aliakmon river has the largest upslope area and demonstrates the highest water discharge and sediment yield followed by acheloos and aoos rivers 3 data the main dataset includes monthly water discharge and suspended sediment loads which have been obtained from the public power corporation ppc prior to damming poulos 1999 leontaritis and baltas 2014 and cover different time periods for each river see table 1 these data have been further processed and the minimum maximum average value of water discharge and suspended sediments were obtained the two involved variables monthly water discharge w and suspended sediment transport s were expressed in m 3 s and kg s correspondingly table 1 to describe the geomorphological conditions of each watershed the digital elevation model over europe eu dem was used having a grid resolution of 25 25 m after processing the dem through saga gis software the catchment area and river network was produced for each river then the upslope part of all catchments was identified and the main topographic variables for each one of these were obtained through g i s mean max altitude slope catchment area etc geological maps at a scale of 1 50 000 were overlaid to the catchment area of each river and after further processing of the data in g i s the main lithological formations have been identified 4 methods the scatter plots of the monthly values of water discharge w and suspended sediment s for each river show a complex nonlinear relation between these two variables while their natural logarithms show a quite different pattern fig 2 presents an example from arachthos river thus a new methodological approach is adopted in this work which includes the following successive steps preliminary description of the seasonality of water discharge time series plots are created and the sample autocorrelation functions are estimated fig 3 demonstrates an example from river arachthos transformation of the involved variables w and s to their natural logarithms lnw lns selection of random samples from the initial transformed dataset for sample size of 70 then scatterplots of the involved variables are constructed application of the gaussian mixture models gmms to the data using each time different number of components and covariance matrix specifications selection of the best fitted model by using information criteria such as the akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic introduced by akaike 1974 and schwarz 1978 respectively regression analysis for the data of each sub group in order to establish the mathematical relationship between suspended sediment and water discharge the distribution of residuals for possible autocorrelations in each sub group is also investigated during this stage in addition to the above mentioned methodological steps we have performed a monte carlo simulation on our data in order to approximate the variation of the parameters furthermore we validate our model by a train and test procedure estimating various measurements like mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and the coefficient of determination r2 for actual vs predicted values of the untransformed variables 4 1 preliminary description of seasonality the time series data of water discharge w are visualized as an example for the case of arachthos river where a clear seasonal pattern can be observed in fig 3 furthermore we investigate the sample autocorrelation function in the same figure we observe the time series plot and the estimated sample autocorrelation between the values of monthly water discharge of arachthos river at various lags we note that in the lags 12 and 24 the autocorrelation coefficients are statistically significant at 95 confidence level our sample data shows significant values for the first two lags and the lags around 12 and 24 the significant values at low lags are an indication of correlation between neighboring month observations and the largest spikes around 12 and 24 show a strong seasonality pattern which is quite similar for all the other rivers 4 2 log transformation and the unlabeled data set the log transformation is applied in order to ensure that the involved variables are approximately normally distributed however it is known that log transformed data leads to biased estimates of the moments during the inverse transformation to the original data space and thus different correction factors have been proposed e g koch and smillie 1986 ferguson 1987 jansson 1996 for this work random samples from the initial dataset were taken sample size 70 of the total observations in order to avoid possible autocorrelations these samples are treated as an unlabeled set in the process of finding patterns and identifying possible homogeneous sub groups fig 2 demonstrates an example after the transformation of the data we observe that they are scattered and seem to present at least two modes in such situations we can use a mixture of several components instead of a single component distribution in these mixture models there are two kinds of variables the observables in our case the input variables and the latent ones which are never observed and correspond to the mixture component parameters the main question of mixture models is the unique characterization of all the parameters the so called identifiability which has to be solved prior to the estimation of parameters in the mixture model teicher 1963 provides the necessary and sufficient conditions for a finite mixture to be identifiable while yakovicz spragins 1968 established the conditions for d dimensional gaussian mixtures in practice the problem of identifiability of the unknown parameters if present can be easily resolved when using the appropriate constraints for these parameters mclachlan and basford 1988 4 3 gaussian mixture model gmm in a gaussian mixture model we consider the final density function f x of sample points x as the result of the sum of j components f j of the normal multivariate distribution f x θ j 1 k f j x θ p j where f j is a multivariate normal density function p j are the mixing fractions θ is the vector containing the unknown parameters θ p j θ denotes the unknown parameters associated with the frequencies of each component s f j and finally the sum of p j over the specified range is equal to j 1 k p j 1 p j 0 in the univariate case the mixing of two unimodal distributions having different means produces a bimodal frequency curve while in two dimensions the existence of two components is visualized by two different groups of contours of equal probability usually in the form of ellipses we consider that our observations x corresponding to the transformed variables lnw lns can be described by a two dimensional 2 d gaussian mixture distribution x p 1 n m 1 s 1 p 2 n m 2 s 2 where m 1 m 2 are the means of the components of the normal distributions p 1 p 2 the mixing proportions s 1 s 2 the covariance matrices the two dimensional normal distribution is n m s 2 π 1 s 1 2 exp 1 2 x m t s 1 χ m where m s are the mean and the covariance matrix accordingly the most common method to fit finite mixture models to a given set of data is the expectation and maximization algorithm see appendix proposed by dempster et al 1977 which is a computational scheme to calculate the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of the statistical model mclachlan and peel 2000 mclachlan et al 2019 to select the best model we use the aic and bic criteria introduced by akaike 1974 and schwarz 1978 respectively which are commonly used criteria for model selection these criteria are estimators of the out of sample prediction error and deal with the tradeoff between the complexity of a model expressed by the number of parameters and the measure of goodness of fit estimated by the likelihood of the parameters therefore it is optimal to select a model that minimizes them 4 4 model implementation for our data we used matlab r2018b procedures to implement the expectation maximization algorithm for the estimation of the gaussian mixture parameters by maximum likelihood because the number of components is not obvious we fit several gmms varying the number of components and the covariance structure the number of components determines the number of sub populations in the sample data while the structure of the covariance matrix for each component reflects the geometrical characteristics of the confidence ellipses a series of gaussian mixture models gmms for a combination of different covariance matrices diagonal full shared not shared and different number of components 8 distinct gmm models table 2 were tested and the best fitted model was selected based on aic bic criteria we also perform a monte carlo simulation to get an indication of the variation of the parameters for each model 5 results and discussion 5 1 application of the gmm model to sample data we explore a sample of time series observations x t w h e r e t 1 2 n of a bivariate process which comes from a probability density f x the sample data is considered to be independent and derived from a common distribution characterizing the underlying process the data disposition suggests that f x can be approximated by a finite mixture model of the form f x j 1 k p j f j x after running many gmms each time with different parameters number of components shared not shared covariance matrix and covariance type we choose the best model for each river based on the criteria bic aic that were discussed before table 2 shows an example of this procedure for river arachthos in this table the number of iterations until convergence and the values of negative log likelihood are presented for each gmm models gm4 and gm8 use full covariance matrices and are the best fitted models for two and three components respectively table 2 in the same table we observe that the number of iterations until convergence increases with the number of components and for equal number of components when full covariance matrix is used the values of log likelihood aic and bic decrease this is also the case when using shared covariance matrix for the case of aracthos river that is demonstrated in table 2 if we use the best gmm for two components we calculate two sub groups of data with mean values of 2 07 0 46 and 4 3 3 17 for lnw and lns accordingly while for 3 components we calculate 3 subgroups with mean values lnw lns of 4 36 3 22 2 05 0 39 and 3 65 2 83 in this case we select a two component model as the best gmm because it is in accordance with the natural explanation of the hydrologic conditions in the study area following the same procedure for all rivers we observe that the best gmm is in all cases the one with not shared covariance matrix of full type in general the best gmms for 2 and 3 components are comparable and we choose the gmm with two components as the best model for each river in order to reflect the seasonality of our data wet and dry periods table 3 presents the best fitted models minimum values of the akaike and or bayesian information criteria for the four rivers for each component the mean value the covariance matrix and the mixture proportions are presented also the correlation coefficient for each component indicating how well a regression line fits the data lns lnw in each subgroup has been calculated the next step involves plotting the data lnw lns for each river and visualizing the data patterns through matlab r2018b by fitting for each subgroup the ellipses of probability and their corresponding regression lines we can remark that in the case of the three rivers arachthos aoos and aliakmon the two components regimes are clearly separated however in the case of acheloos river the separation of the two components is not obvious fig 4 this particular river has extremely erodible lithology and presents one of the highest annual suspended sediment yields among all rivers debouching into the mediterranean sea poulos and collins 2002 in general 42 45 of the data points correspond to component 1 low mean values of lns and lnw of the gmm while 55 58 correspond to component 2 high mean values of lns and lnw except from the case of arachthos where component 2 is even larger 65 aic bic and negative log likelihood values are comparable for the acheloos aliakmon and aoos river while for arachthos river they are much lower the correlation coefficient between the two variables lnw lns for component 2 wet of all rivers is very high 0 94 while for component 1 dry it is also very high with the exception of acheloos river 0 86 and aliakmon river 0 85 table 4 summarizes the basic statistical parameters of the fitted linear regression for all river data components we can observe the high correlation coefficient and r2 corresponding to p values lower than 0 05 in all cases showing that there is significant statistical relationship between the involved variables lnw and lns at confidence interval 95 5 2 exploration of the residuals in the case of arachthos river we explore also the distribution of residuals deviation of the observations from sample mean which is an observable estimate of the unobservable statistical error to detect possible patterns fig 5 we observe that for both components there is no general pattern however the data distribution is not clearly symmetrical showing a possible autocorrelation one of the plots component 2 shows heteroscedasticity of the residuals 5 3 the two component distribution interpretation high rainfall in general induces high water discharge which is closely related to suspended sediment transport however these processes have complex relations depending on a number of factors such as the spatial characteristics of rainfalls the geometric pattern of the drainage basin the lithology the vegetation and land use the volume of suspended sediment depends also on the availability of the weathering material these factors must be considered during the evaluation and interpretation of the statistical results the concentration of suspended sediment varies during the year depending on the river discharge cycle anderman 2012 and or the seasonality of flooding e g black and werritty 1997 dettinger and diaz 2000 alila and mtiraoui 2002 schmidt and morche 2006 strupczewski et al 2012 bowers et al 2012 during the long dry period the lack of humidity results in the decrease of the vegetation cover enhancing soil weathering and erosion during the subsequent wet period the analysis of sample data points representing water discharge and suspended sediments from the four rivers suggest the presence of a mixture of distributions this mixture can be explained by the existence of many physical processes contributing to river flows and suspended sediment production such as rainfall distribution ground water processes infiltration and erosional processes whose combined action depends also on their spatial and temporal variability another critical factor that influences the seasonality of these input variables is human intervention related to both changes of land cover e g deforestation agriculture overgrazing and to river flow regulations i e hydro electric and irrigation dams which may change the infiltration rates the evaporation mechanism the weathering and erosion processes thus may influence both freshwater and suspended sediment fluxes of a drainage basin gallart et al 2002 proposed that during the wet period high rainfall and increased sediment transport related to intense erosion takes place while during the dry period the weathering mechanism is dominant sivapalan et al 2005 and strupczewski et al 2012 have concluded that seasonality has an impact on the variability of storm characteristics evapotranspiration antecedent moisture conditions flood frequency and finally peak flows of water discharge 5 3 1 hydrological regimes the proportions of each component table 3 that was calculated by applying the gmm model coincides with the estimated percentage of time for which each regime wet or dry is operating for the four rivers we can observe that all rivers have longer wet periods that ranges between 54 89 and 64 57 arachthos river has significantly longer wet period that the other three rivers table 5 we must highlight that the terms wet and dry are related to the component distributions and do not exactly coincide with the real wet and dry climatic periods for this mediterranean area in our study it seems that the seasonality of rainfalls fotiadi et al 1999 pnevmatikos and katsoulis 2006 erosional processes and the runoff mechanism corresponds to different environmental regimes which reflect the two distinct data components distributions the first homogeneous group seems to represent in general a period of high water discharge and relatively high sediment transport occurring during the winter but also during spring while the second group is related to lower water discharge and low sediment transport mainly during summer and the start of autumn fig 4 the transition from one group component to the other can be modelled by a binary variable regime variable which determines each time the component distribution this variable can be described by a stationary or non stationary markov chain lindgren 1978 lu and berliner 1999 the first group component represents the dry period while the second group corresponds to the wet period in general each river has its own seasonal pattern which can also vary during the time there is also strong contrast between the wet and dry period in the cases of arachthos aoos and aliakmon rivers this is not clearly observed in the case of acheloos fig 4 5 3 2 the regime variable and markov chains the regime variable i t define the wet and dry environment and accounts for different water discharge sediment transport distributions the evolution of this regime variable can be approximated by a markov chain this variable corresponds to physical states with high water discharge high sediment transport i t 1 and relatively low water discharge low sediment transport i t 0 i t 1 with probability p t w e t s t a t e w h e r e t 1 2 12 i t 0 w i t h p r o b a b i l i t y 1 p t d r y s t a t e for example when the process starts on january then t 1 i 1 1 with probability p 1 and i 1 0 with probability 1 p 1 this means that the probability of the system taking the value i t 1 which corresponds to the wet regime is p 1 and the probability for the system to be in the dry regime i t 0 is 1 p 1 the whole model comprises an initial distribution of states p i t a transition matrix between the states p i t 1 i t and a probability distribution based on the sample data p i t x t in such models we proceed to estimate lns at time t for the current state of the regime variable i t which selects the proper probability distribution and given the natural logarithm of discharge lnw the dependent variable is calculated we demonstrate this procedure for the case of arachtos river in fig 6 which shows the time evolution of the regime changes for this river 5 3 3 switching regression a thorough analysis of the gmm can be be achieved through the application of different regression equations for each component a procedure known as switching regression quandt 1972 jackson 1975 diggle and zeger 1989 hughes and guttorp 1994 frühwirth schnatter 2006 this model can be considered as a hidden markov model thyer and kuczera 2000 evin et al 2011 a special case of the general state space models in practice the fitted model distinguishes efficiently the different hydrological regimes we firstly calculate the regime variable using the estimated probability for each month we find that the months from december to march have very high probability to be wet whereas july august and september have a high probability to be dry fig 6 for the remaining months the probability of regime variable is a function of the prior probability to be in a given state for a month at time t and the value of lnw at time t this can be the base to formulate a time transition markov chain but it was not our intention to further explore this problem as we focused on fitting a gmm to sample data points this model can be used so that given the regime variable the sediment transport of a month can be calculated when water discharge is known 5 3 4 simulation we perform a monte carlo simulation in arachthos river as an example to obtain some approximation of the variance of the estimates of the parameters of the final model fig 7 shows the results of the application of the mixture model the ellipses of probability and linear regression for 500 synthetic data points of arachthos river in table 6 we present the basic statistical parameters of these simulation data 5 4 validation of the models to assess the models results we use different types of performance measures in the initial stage we assessed different gmm s with various parameters by using the aic and bic information criteria next we show that the final regression lines table 4 fig 4 for each component of all rivers present high values of correlation coefficient r indicating very strong relationships between the two variables lnw and lns furthermore the explained percentage of the variability of the dependent variable lns by the fitted model is very high since r squared r2 is high for all rivers we also validate the absolute quality of the model which involves checking the residuals of the models fig 5 and test the models predictions accuracy to achieve this we divide our data in training and test sets 80 and 20 respectively apply the gmm model to the training set and then using its results we calculate the predicted values of suspended sediment for the test set we re transform the logarithmic predicted and actual values to arithmetic ones and we validate the results using different types of performance measures such as mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and r squared mean absolute error mae is the simplest way to compare actual vs forecasted values being a good indication of prediction accuracy root mean square error rmse expresses the standard deviation of prediction errors both these measures are always positive while values close to zero indicate a perfect fit of the predicted data the coefficient of determination r2 is an indication of the colinearity of actual vs predicted data and describes the proportion of variance in the actual data that can be described by our model table 7 shows the forementioned performance measures for each river for training and test sets we observe that in general the values of the performance measures of test data are lower than the training set which indicates that the model is able to generalize successfully to new data reunanen 2003 6 conclusions the investigation of the complex relation between monthly water discharge and the related suspended sediment load through the analysis of gmm model leads to a more effective approach of the seasonality of these variables this allows us to estimate more precisely the relationship between these variables than by using conventional methods hence the switching regression mixture models are more appropriate for the relationship of the aforementioned variables in medium to small size mountainous rivers where seasonal differences are high such as those in the mediterranean area the successful application of the gmm model to the transformed variables lnw lns in the case of four rivers of the southern balkans produces two different sets of ellipses of probability with two distinctive components in the case of aoos aliakmon and arachthos rivers however in the case of acheloos river they are not so clearly distinct the existence of these two components is attributed to the seasonality of these hydrological variables furthermore the elongation of the ellipses representing the transformed variables lnw lns reveals a strong correlation between the logarithms of water discharge and suspended sediment fluxes however the seasonality that is observed in all rivers exhibits different patterns duration and flow characteristics which is a result of differences in their hydrological processes the regression parameters for each component of the data for the rivers under investigation present very high correlation coefficients and low p values implying a statistically significant relationship between the involved variables at the 95 confidence level moreover the results obtained by testing the performance of the model indicate this model can generalize well to new data on the basis of the above the application of the gmm which involves the estimation of the mixture parameters produces specific patterns which reflect the seasonality of the involved variables these patterns are suitable for the quantitative prediction of the sediment fluxes when water discharge is known this methodology could be used in most cases around the world concerning medium to small size mountainous river catchments belonging to the temperate climatic zone declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix expectation maximization algorithm e m algorithm maximum likelihood the most common and optimal way to estimate the parameters of a probability distribution in a random sample is the maximum likelihood estimation which is also used by the e m algorithm let the density of the d dimension random vector x is f x θ s where θ s the vector of the unknown parameters and θ s θ the parameter space if we dispose a random sample x 1 x 2 x n originating from the above probability density then the likelihood function is l θ i 1 n f x i θ s also we define the natural logarithm of l θ l θ ln l θ and we estimate θ which is a maximiser of l θ θ a r g m a x l θ this is achieved by using the fisher score function u θ l θ θ s and by equating this function to zero we get the log likelihood equation u θ 0 apart from the estimation of unknown parameters we can calculate the standard errors of these estimates this is achieved by calculating the observed information matrix which is the negative matrix of the partial derivatives of u θ j θ u θ θ s in asymptotic statistics the standard error of θ is related to j θ with the following equation efron and hinkley 1978 lehmann and casella 1998 s e θ j 1 θ 1 2 e m algorithm the e m algorithm classifies data using a soft clustering approach by calculating a probability for each data point to belong to each constituent distribution it alternates between two steps in the first step e step it computes the conditional expectation and in the second step m step the maximization problem is solved each iteration of the algorithm produces higher or at least the same estimates of the likelihood parameters monotonicity of the e m algorithm and the algorithm is repeated until convergence is achieved dempster et al 1977 mclachlan and peel 2000 mclachlan et al 2019 in more detail the e m uses the complete data set z x y where x is the incomplete data set and y a set of hidden parameters in order to overcome the hard calculations of the log likelihood function of the initial data set the algorithm starts with some initial guesses of the parameters then this iterative procedure is performed involving two steps in the e step the algorithm estimates the expected value of the complete data given the observations x and the current estimate of parameters θ κ this can be represented by a function q θ θ κ e l n f x θ x θ κ in the m step the q function is maximized θ κ 1 a r g m a x q θ θ κ and the new value of θ is then calculated these steps are repeated until convergence is achieved 
5178,the aim of this paper is to investigate the complex relationship between monthly water discharge and suspended sediment load using a flexible statistical model i e a gaussian mixture model the theoretical principles of this model and its related expectation maximization e m algorithm are briefly analyzed and subsequently applied to hydrologic data of four medium sized mountainous rivers of the southern balkan peninsula i e acheloos arachthos aoos and aliakmon whose data distribution of the aforementioned variables shows the existence of two sub populations a gaussian mixture model gmm is fitted to the sample points for each river and then its parameters are tuned by comparing different information criteria in order to determine the optimum parameter settings these parameters latent variables are associated with the generation mechanism of the bivariate distribution which alternates between two components regimes related to the seasonality of the hydrological variables the latter being characteristic of the mediterranean environment comprising of a wet and dry intra annual variability of water discharge and suspended sediment load the transitions between the two regimes can be approximated by a markov chain switching regression model which can be used for the estimation of monthly suspended sediment fluxes when the corresponding water discharge is known keywords gaussian mixture models switching regression rating curves probabilistic forecasting mountainous mediterranean rivers 1 introduction the major component of total sediment load transported by mountainous rivers of medium and small size 104 km2 is the suspended load with the other two being the dissolved and bed load milliman and syvitski 1992 poulos and collins 2002 milliman and farnsworth 2011 poulos 2019 on the other hand reliable and long term measurements of suspended sediment load are sparse especially in the case of medium small rivers milliman and farnsworth 2011 this has led to the development of various approaches for predicting the suspended sediment load from the climatic and physicogeographic parameters of river catchments i e water discharge lithology soil type vegetation cover land use climatic conditions elevation slope gradient such as those provided by wischmeier and smith 1978 dissmeyer and foster 1980 probst 1990 moreover due to spatial and temporal variation of the aforementioned physical parameters and their complex relationships estimates of suspended sediment fluxes have been based primarily on their relationship to water discharge which is usually easier to obtain e g walling 1977 koutsogiannis and tarla 1987 milliman and syvitski 1992 poulos et al 1996 poulos and collins 2002 zarris et al 2012 cohen et al 2015 poulos 2019 these estimates have never achieved very strong monthly correlations which is partially due to flow seasonality that depends on the complex physical setting of the river basin milliman and syvitski 1992 poulos et al 1996 this non linear relationship can also be attributed to the nonconformity between the mass of water and transported particles as well as the spatial and time dependent changes of water velocity in the stream in particular scatterplot diagrams of water discharge and suspended sediment fluxes can be described and explained using various controlling factors such as seasonality of fluxes water temperature the lag time of water and sediment hydrograph the hysteretic effect related to rising and falling stage and the variation of tributary inflows e g loughran 1974 walling 1983 williams 1989 sadeghi et al 2008 zhang et al 2018 the most common relationship between water discharge and suspended sediment load called sediment rating curve is a power polynomial sigmoid or inverse function according to walling 1974 ferguson 1986 asselman 2000 syvitski et al 2000 zhang et al 2018 rating curves have been extensively used in the past however correlation is usually poor due to an obvious scatter of sample points of the involved variables i e water discharge and suspended sediment flux making them quite often of no practical use e g walling 1988 asselman 2000 horowitz 2003 to improve the correlation coefficient in such cases an additional grouping of data related to seasons has been proposed in the past walling 1977 mimikou 1982 in order to overcome this problem based on our data disposition and the dominant intra annual climatic variation of the study area gaussian mixture models gmm mclachlan and basford 1988 frühwirth schnatter 2006 have been used these models are constructed using a weighted sum of normal distributions representing sub groups of data points with unique parameters such mixture models have been used in hydrology since 1970 s and progressively evolved to flexible tools for the analysis of different kind of heterogeneous distributions e g frigessi et al 2002 carreau et al 2009 grego and yates 2010 evin et al 2011 yan et al 2017 liu et al 2018 however to our knowledge these models have not been used in the context of the relationship between monthly water discharge and suspended sediments in this paper we explore the complex relation between monthly water discharge and the related suspended sediment fluxes in the case of four mountainous rivers in southern europe balkan peninsula using the analysis of mixture frequency distributions our main objective is to show that the monthly data of the aforementioned variables present patterns expressed by two distinct sub populations and then by fittting a probabilistic function which represents the sum of components of the gaussian distribution to predict suspended sediment load when water discharge is given this new methodology incorporates a better approach of seasonality which in turn could provide more precisely the relationship between monthly water discharge and suspended sediment loads 2 study area 2 1 location geological and geomorphological characteristics the study area is located along the pindus mountain chain in the southwestern part of the balkan peninsula which incorporates large parts of the drainage basins of aliakmon aoos arachthos and acheloos rivers fig 1 the topography of the pindus mountain chain is the result of alpine tectonic neotectonic deformation underhill 1989 karakitsios 2013 and quaternary erosional processes in general in the upper part of these river catchments steep topography prevails and the rivers tend to be braided while the lower parts are characterized by gentle slopes alluvial deposits and meander formations the general geological and geomorphological characteristics for each river are described below aliakmon river located in the northern part of greece is dominated by metamorphic rocks mountrakis 1983 followed by tertiary and quaternary formations and is the longest river in greece while its drainage area stretches over about 8 500 km2 aoos river is situated in northwestern greece flowing from greece towards albania into the adriatic sea the main lithological formations of its watershed are carbonates flysch neogene and quaternary formations aoos river drains a large area greater than 6 800 km2 of which only a small portion belongs to greece arachthos river is situated in the western part of greece it has a drainage area of about 2 000 km2 and flows from pindus mountain range towards the ambracian gulf the drainage basin of arachthos consists of carbonates flysch and quaternary formations acheloos river is one of the principal rivers in greece having a drainage area of 5 638 km2 the main lithological units are carbonates flysch and a few pliocene and alluvial formations lithology plays a key role in the determination of the balance between water discharge and suspended sediments in a river in the study area there are mainly four groups of rocks in the forementioned drainage basins 1 quaternary and neogene formations which are very erodible 2 flysch and molasse formations which are relatively easily eroded 3 metamorphic rocks mainly gneiss and schists but also ophiolites which are characterized by variable resistance to erosion 4 carbonates which being subjected primarily to chemical weathering processes have very small contribution to suspended sediment load 2 2 climate and vegetation the northern part of greece is generally characterized by a temperate type of climate while the presence of pindus mountain range divides the area into two climatic sub regions according to pnevmatikos and katsoulis 2006 i the western side of pindus mountain range extending to the ionian sea with annual mean rainfall between 357 and 1 323 mm year and ii the relatively dry eastern side extending to the aegean sea with annual mean rainfall ranging from 324 to 777 mm year the annual precipitation in western greece is about 1 000 mm near the coastal zone while in the hinterland it is higher exceeding 2 000 mm fotiadi et al 1999 thus the river catchment areas under investigation are subjected to intense seasonal climatic changes with cold wet winters and warm dry summers vegetation in the study area and in more general in greece varies from forest with coniferous trees and prairies in the mountain areas to grazing land and sparse cover in the low land the distribution of the vegetation cover and the temperate mediterranean climatic conditions favors erosional processes although of various intensity according to the spatial variability of the physicogeographic characteristics 2 3 discharge sediment yield water discharge and suspended sediment loads were measured for a long period of time at one gauging station for each river for location see fig 1 a period predating the construction of hydroelectric dams along the course of these rivers which occurred before the 1990s poulos 1999 leontaritis and baltas 2014 these measurements are interrelated to the conditions in the upslope area while for each river the starting year of operation of the gauging station and the duration of measurements in months is presented in table 1 the combined geomorphological and hydrological characteristics for all rivers are demonstrated in table 1 we observe that arachthos river in contrary to having the smallest upslope area demonstrates the highest suspended sediment flux and water discharge between the remaining rivers aliakmon river has the largest upslope area and demonstrates the highest water discharge and sediment yield followed by acheloos and aoos rivers 3 data the main dataset includes monthly water discharge and suspended sediment loads which have been obtained from the public power corporation ppc prior to damming poulos 1999 leontaritis and baltas 2014 and cover different time periods for each river see table 1 these data have been further processed and the minimum maximum average value of water discharge and suspended sediments were obtained the two involved variables monthly water discharge w and suspended sediment transport s were expressed in m 3 s and kg s correspondingly table 1 to describe the geomorphological conditions of each watershed the digital elevation model over europe eu dem was used having a grid resolution of 25 25 m after processing the dem through saga gis software the catchment area and river network was produced for each river then the upslope part of all catchments was identified and the main topographic variables for each one of these were obtained through g i s mean max altitude slope catchment area etc geological maps at a scale of 1 50 000 were overlaid to the catchment area of each river and after further processing of the data in g i s the main lithological formations have been identified 4 methods the scatter plots of the monthly values of water discharge w and suspended sediment s for each river show a complex nonlinear relation between these two variables while their natural logarithms show a quite different pattern fig 2 presents an example from arachthos river thus a new methodological approach is adopted in this work which includes the following successive steps preliminary description of the seasonality of water discharge time series plots are created and the sample autocorrelation functions are estimated fig 3 demonstrates an example from river arachthos transformation of the involved variables w and s to their natural logarithms lnw lns selection of random samples from the initial transformed dataset for sample size of 70 then scatterplots of the involved variables are constructed application of the gaussian mixture models gmms to the data using each time different number of components and covariance matrix specifications selection of the best fitted model by using information criteria such as the akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic introduced by akaike 1974 and schwarz 1978 respectively regression analysis for the data of each sub group in order to establish the mathematical relationship between suspended sediment and water discharge the distribution of residuals for possible autocorrelations in each sub group is also investigated during this stage in addition to the above mentioned methodological steps we have performed a monte carlo simulation on our data in order to approximate the variation of the parameters furthermore we validate our model by a train and test procedure estimating various measurements like mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and the coefficient of determination r2 for actual vs predicted values of the untransformed variables 4 1 preliminary description of seasonality the time series data of water discharge w are visualized as an example for the case of arachthos river where a clear seasonal pattern can be observed in fig 3 furthermore we investigate the sample autocorrelation function in the same figure we observe the time series plot and the estimated sample autocorrelation between the values of monthly water discharge of arachthos river at various lags we note that in the lags 12 and 24 the autocorrelation coefficients are statistically significant at 95 confidence level our sample data shows significant values for the first two lags and the lags around 12 and 24 the significant values at low lags are an indication of correlation between neighboring month observations and the largest spikes around 12 and 24 show a strong seasonality pattern which is quite similar for all the other rivers 4 2 log transformation and the unlabeled data set the log transformation is applied in order to ensure that the involved variables are approximately normally distributed however it is known that log transformed data leads to biased estimates of the moments during the inverse transformation to the original data space and thus different correction factors have been proposed e g koch and smillie 1986 ferguson 1987 jansson 1996 for this work random samples from the initial dataset were taken sample size 70 of the total observations in order to avoid possible autocorrelations these samples are treated as an unlabeled set in the process of finding patterns and identifying possible homogeneous sub groups fig 2 demonstrates an example after the transformation of the data we observe that they are scattered and seem to present at least two modes in such situations we can use a mixture of several components instead of a single component distribution in these mixture models there are two kinds of variables the observables in our case the input variables and the latent ones which are never observed and correspond to the mixture component parameters the main question of mixture models is the unique characterization of all the parameters the so called identifiability which has to be solved prior to the estimation of parameters in the mixture model teicher 1963 provides the necessary and sufficient conditions for a finite mixture to be identifiable while yakovicz spragins 1968 established the conditions for d dimensional gaussian mixtures in practice the problem of identifiability of the unknown parameters if present can be easily resolved when using the appropriate constraints for these parameters mclachlan and basford 1988 4 3 gaussian mixture model gmm in a gaussian mixture model we consider the final density function f x of sample points x as the result of the sum of j components f j of the normal multivariate distribution f x θ j 1 k f j x θ p j where f j is a multivariate normal density function p j are the mixing fractions θ is the vector containing the unknown parameters θ p j θ denotes the unknown parameters associated with the frequencies of each component s f j and finally the sum of p j over the specified range is equal to j 1 k p j 1 p j 0 in the univariate case the mixing of two unimodal distributions having different means produces a bimodal frequency curve while in two dimensions the existence of two components is visualized by two different groups of contours of equal probability usually in the form of ellipses we consider that our observations x corresponding to the transformed variables lnw lns can be described by a two dimensional 2 d gaussian mixture distribution x p 1 n m 1 s 1 p 2 n m 2 s 2 where m 1 m 2 are the means of the components of the normal distributions p 1 p 2 the mixing proportions s 1 s 2 the covariance matrices the two dimensional normal distribution is n m s 2 π 1 s 1 2 exp 1 2 x m t s 1 χ m where m s are the mean and the covariance matrix accordingly the most common method to fit finite mixture models to a given set of data is the expectation and maximization algorithm see appendix proposed by dempster et al 1977 which is a computational scheme to calculate the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of the statistical model mclachlan and peel 2000 mclachlan et al 2019 to select the best model we use the aic and bic criteria introduced by akaike 1974 and schwarz 1978 respectively which are commonly used criteria for model selection these criteria are estimators of the out of sample prediction error and deal with the tradeoff between the complexity of a model expressed by the number of parameters and the measure of goodness of fit estimated by the likelihood of the parameters therefore it is optimal to select a model that minimizes them 4 4 model implementation for our data we used matlab r2018b procedures to implement the expectation maximization algorithm for the estimation of the gaussian mixture parameters by maximum likelihood because the number of components is not obvious we fit several gmms varying the number of components and the covariance structure the number of components determines the number of sub populations in the sample data while the structure of the covariance matrix for each component reflects the geometrical characteristics of the confidence ellipses a series of gaussian mixture models gmms for a combination of different covariance matrices diagonal full shared not shared and different number of components 8 distinct gmm models table 2 were tested and the best fitted model was selected based on aic bic criteria we also perform a monte carlo simulation to get an indication of the variation of the parameters for each model 5 results and discussion 5 1 application of the gmm model to sample data we explore a sample of time series observations x t w h e r e t 1 2 n of a bivariate process which comes from a probability density f x the sample data is considered to be independent and derived from a common distribution characterizing the underlying process the data disposition suggests that f x can be approximated by a finite mixture model of the form f x j 1 k p j f j x after running many gmms each time with different parameters number of components shared not shared covariance matrix and covariance type we choose the best model for each river based on the criteria bic aic that were discussed before table 2 shows an example of this procedure for river arachthos in this table the number of iterations until convergence and the values of negative log likelihood are presented for each gmm models gm4 and gm8 use full covariance matrices and are the best fitted models for two and three components respectively table 2 in the same table we observe that the number of iterations until convergence increases with the number of components and for equal number of components when full covariance matrix is used the values of log likelihood aic and bic decrease this is also the case when using shared covariance matrix for the case of aracthos river that is demonstrated in table 2 if we use the best gmm for two components we calculate two sub groups of data with mean values of 2 07 0 46 and 4 3 3 17 for lnw and lns accordingly while for 3 components we calculate 3 subgroups with mean values lnw lns of 4 36 3 22 2 05 0 39 and 3 65 2 83 in this case we select a two component model as the best gmm because it is in accordance with the natural explanation of the hydrologic conditions in the study area following the same procedure for all rivers we observe that the best gmm is in all cases the one with not shared covariance matrix of full type in general the best gmms for 2 and 3 components are comparable and we choose the gmm with two components as the best model for each river in order to reflect the seasonality of our data wet and dry periods table 3 presents the best fitted models minimum values of the akaike and or bayesian information criteria for the four rivers for each component the mean value the covariance matrix and the mixture proportions are presented also the correlation coefficient for each component indicating how well a regression line fits the data lns lnw in each subgroup has been calculated the next step involves plotting the data lnw lns for each river and visualizing the data patterns through matlab r2018b by fitting for each subgroup the ellipses of probability and their corresponding regression lines we can remark that in the case of the three rivers arachthos aoos and aliakmon the two components regimes are clearly separated however in the case of acheloos river the separation of the two components is not obvious fig 4 this particular river has extremely erodible lithology and presents one of the highest annual suspended sediment yields among all rivers debouching into the mediterranean sea poulos and collins 2002 in general 42 45 of the data points correspond to component 1 low mean values of lns and lnw of the gmm while 55 58 correspond to component 2 high mean values of lns and lnw except from the case of arachthos where component 2 is even larger 65 aic bic and negative log likelihood values are comparable for the acheloos aliakmon and aoos river while for arachthos river they are much lower the correlation coefficient between the two variables lnw lns for component 2 wet of all rivers is very high 0 94 while for component 1 dry it is also very high with the exception of acheloos river 0 86 and aliakmon river 0 85 table 4 summarizes the basic statistical parameters of the fitted linear regression for all river data components we can observe the high correlation coefficient and r2 corresponding to p values lower than 0 05 in all cases showing that there is significant statistical relationship between the involved variables lnw and lns at confidence interval 95 5 2 exploration of the residuals in the case of arachthos river we explore also the distribution of residuals deviation of the observations from sample mean which is an observable estimate of the unobservable statistical error to detect possible patterns fig 5 we observe that for both components there is no general pattern however the data distribution is not clearly symmetrical showing a possible autocorrelation one of the plots component 2 shows heteroscedasticity of the residuals 5 3 the two component distribution interpretation high rainfall in general induces high water discharge which is closely related to suspended sediment transport however these processes have complex relations depending on a number of factors such as the spatial characteristics of rainfalls the geometric pattern of the drainage basin the lithology the vegetation and land use the volume of suspended sediment depends also on the availability of the weathering material these factors must be considered during the evaluation and interpretation of the statistical results the concentration of suspended sediment varies during the year depending on the river discharge cycle anderman 2012 and or the seasonality of flooding e g black and werritty 1997 dettinger and diaz 2000 alila and mtiraoui 2002 schmidt and morche 2006 strupczewski et al 2012 bowers et al 2012 during the long dry period the lack of humidity results in the decrease of the vegetation cover enhancing soil weathering and erosion during the subsequent wet period the analysis of sample data points representing water discharge and suspended sediments from the four rivers suggest the presence of a mixture of distributions this mixture can be explained by the existence of many physical processes contributing to river flows and suspended sediment production such as rainfall distribution ground water processes infiltration and erosional processes whose combined action depends also on their spatial and temporal variability another critical factor that influences the seasonality of these input variables is human intervention related to both changes of land cover e g deforestation agriculture overgrazing and to river flow regulations i e hydro electric and irrigation dams which may change the infiltration rates the evaporation mechanism the weathering and erosion processes thus may influence both freshwater and suspended sediment fluxes of a drainage basin gallart et al 2002 proposed that during the wet period high rainfall and increased sediment transport related to intense erosion takes place while during the dry period the weathering mechanism is dominant sivapalan et al 2005 and strupczewski et al 2012 have concluded that seasonality has an impact on the variability of storm characteristics evapotranspiration antecedent moisture conditions flood frequency and finally peak flows of water discharge 5 3 1 hydrological regimes the proportions of each component table 3 that was calculated by applying the gmm model coincides with the estimated percentage of time for which each regime wet or dry is operating for the four rivers we can observe that all rivers have longer wet periods that ranges between 54 89 and 64 57 arachthos river has significantly longer wet period that the other three rivers table 5 we must highlight that the terms wet and dry are related to the component distributions and do not exactly coincide with the real wet and dry climatic periods for this mediterranean area in our study it seems that the seasonality of rainfalls fotiadi et al 1999 pnevmatikos and katsoulis 2006 erosional processes and the runoff mechanism corresponds to different environmental regimes which reflect the two distinct data components distributions the first homogeneous group seems to represent in general a period of high water discharge and relatively high sediment transport occurring during the winter but also during spring while the second group is related to lower water discharge and low sediment transport mainly during summer and the start of autumn fig 4 the transition from one group component to the other can be modelled by a binary variable regime variable which determines each time the component distribution this variable can be described by a stationary or non stationary markov chain lindgren 1978 lu and berliner 1999 the first group component represents the dry period while the second group corresponds to the wet period in general each river has its own seasonal pattern which can also vary during the time there is also strong contrast between the wet and dry period in the cases of arachthos aoos and aliakmon rivers this is not clearly observed in the case of acheloos fig 4 5 3 2 the regime variable and markov chains the regime variable i t define the wet and dry environment and accounts for different water discharge sediment transport distributions the evolution of this regime variable can be approximated by a markov chain this variable corresponds to physical states with high water discharge high sediment transport i t 1 and relatively low water discharge low sediment transport i t 0 i t 1 with probability p t w e t s t a t e w h e r e t 1 2 12 i t 0 w i t h p r o b a b i l i t y 1 p t d r y s t a t e for example when the process starts on january then t 1 i 1 1 with probability p 1 and i 1 0 with probability 1 p 1 this means that the probability of the system taking the value i t 1 which corresponds to the wet regime is p 1 and the probability for the system to be in the dry regime i t 0 is 1 p 1 the whole model comprises an initial distribution of states p i t a transition matrix between the states p i t 1 i t and a probability distribution based on the sample data p i t x t in such models we proceed to estimate lns at time t for the current state of the regime variable i t which selects the proper probability distribution and given the natural logarithm of discharge lnw the dependent variable is calculated we demonstrate this procedure for the case of arachtos river in fig 6 which shows the time evolution of the regime changes for this river 5 3 3 switching regression a thorough analysis of the gmm can be be achieved through the application of different regression equations for each component a procedure known as switching regression quandt 1972 jackson 1975 diggle and zeger 1989 hughes and guttorp 1994 frühwirth schnatter 2006 this model can be considered as a hidden markov model thyer and kuczera 2000 evin et al 2011 a special case of the general state space models in practice the fitted model distinguishes efficiently the different hydrological regimes we firstly calculate the regime variable using the estimated probability for each month we find that the months from december to march have very high probability to be wet whereas july august and september have a high probability to be dry fig 6 for the remaining months the probability of regime variable is a function of the prior probability to be in a given state for a month at time t and the value of lnw at time t this can be the base to formulate a time transition markov chain but it was not our intention to further explore this problem as we focused on fitting a gmm to sample data points this model can be used so that given the regime variable the sediment transport of a month can be calculated when water discharge is known 5 3 4 simulation we perform a monte carlo simulation in arachthos river as an example to obtain some approximation of the variance of the estimates of the parameters of the final model fig 7 shows the results of the application of the mixture model the ellipses of probability and linear regression for 500 synthetic data points of arachthos river in table 6 we present the basic statistical parameters of these simulation data 5 4 validation of the models to assess the models results we use different types of performance measures in the initial stage we assessed different gmm s with various parameters by using the aic and bic information criteria next we show that the final regression lines table 4 fig 4 for each component of all rivers present high values of correlation coefficient r indicating very strong relationships between the two variables lnw and lns furthermore the explained percentage of the variability of the dependent variable lns by the fitted model is very high since r squared r2 is high for all rivers we also validate the absolute quality of the model which involves checking the residuals of the models fig 5 and test the models predictions accuracy to achieve this we divide our data in training and test sets 80 and 20 respectively apply the gmm model to the training set and then using its results we calculate the predicted values of suspended sediment for the test set we re transform the logarithmic predicted and actual values to arithmetic ones and we validate the results using different types of performance measures such as mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and r squared mean absolute error mae is the simplest way to compare actual vs forecasted values being a good indication of prediction accuracy root mean square error rmse expresses the standard deviation of prediction errors both these measures are always positive while values close to zero indicate a perfect fit of the predicted data the coefficient of determination r2 is an indication of the colinearity of actual vs predicted data and describes the proportion of variance in the actual data that can be described by our model table 7 shows the forementioned performance measures for each river for training and test sets we observe that in general the values of the performance measures of test data are lower than the training set which indicates that the model is able to generalize successfully to new data reunanen 2003 6 conclusions the investigation of the complex relation between monthly water discharge and the related suspended sediment load through the analysis of gmm model leads to a more effective approach of the seasonality of these variables this allows us to estimate more precisely the relationship between these variables than by using conventional methods hence the switching regression mixture models are more appropriate for the relationship of the aforementioned variables in medium to small size mountainous rivers where seasonal differences are high such as those in the mediterranean area the successful application of the gmm model to the transformed variables lnw lns in the case of four rivers of the southern balkans produces two different sets of ellipses of probability with two distinctive components in the case of aoos aliakmon and arachthos rivers however in the case of acheloos river they are not so clearly distinct the existence of these two components is attributed to the seasonality of these hydrological variables furthermore the elongation of the ellipses representing the transformed variables lnw lns reveals a strong correlation between the logarithms of water discharge and suspended sediment fluxes however the seasonality that is observed in all rivers exhibits different patterns duration and flow characteristics which is a result of differences in their hydrological processes the regression parameters for each component of the data for the rivers under investigation present very high correlation coefficients and low p values implying a statistically significant relationship between the involved variables at the 95 confidence level moreover the results obtained by testing the performance of the model indicate this model can generalize well to new data on the basis of the above the application of the gmm which involves the estimation of the mixture parameters produces specific patterns which reflect the seasonality of the involved variables these patterns are suitable for the quantitative prediction of the sediment fluxes when water discharge is known this methodology could be used in most cases around the world concerning medium to small size mountainous river catchments belonging to the temperate climatic zone declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix expectation maximization algorithm e m algorithm maximum likelihood the most common and optimal way to estimate the parameters of a probability distribution in a random sample is the maximum likelihood estimation which is also used by the e m algorithm let the density of the d dimension random vector x is f x θ s where θ s the vector of the unknown parameters and θ s θ the parameter space if we dispose a random sample x 1 x 2 x n originating from the above probability density then the likelihood function is l θ i 1 n f x i θ s also we define the natural logarithm of l θ l θ ln l θ and we estimate θ which is a maximiser of l θ θ a r g m a x l θ this is achieved by using the fisher score function u θ l θ θ s and by equating this function to zero we get the log likelihood equation u θ 0 apart from the estimation of unknown parameters we can calculate the standard errors of these estimates this is achieved by calculating the observed information matrix which is the negative matrix of the partial derivatives of u θ j θ u θ θ s in asymptotic statistics the standard error of θ is related to j θ with the following equation efron and hinkley 1978 lehmann and casella 1998 s e θ j 1 θ 1 2 e m algorithm the e m algorithm classifies data using a soft clustering approach by calculating a probability for each data point to belong to each constituent distribution it alternates between two steps in the first step e step it computes the conditional expectation and in the second step m step the maximization problem is solved each iteration of the algorithm produces higher or at least the same estimates of the likelihood parameters monotonicity of the e m algorithm and the algorithm is repeated until convergence is achieved dempster et al 1977 mclachlan and peel 2000 mclachlan et al 2019 in more detail the e m uses the complete data set z x y where x is the incomplete data set and y a set of hidden parameters in order to overcome the hard calculations of the log likelihood function of the initial data set the algorithm starts with some initial guesses of the parameters then this iterative procedure is performed involving two steps in the e step the algorithm estimates the expected value of the complete data given the observations x and the current estimate of parameters θ κ this can be represented by a function q θ θ κ e l n f x θ x θ κ in the m step the q function is maximized θ κ 1 a r g m a x q θ θ κ and the new value of θ is then calculated these steps are repeated until convergence is achieved 
5179,at present groundwater vulnerability assessment is mainly aimed at phreatic aquifer but in most areas people draw water from confined aquifer so it is necessary to assess the vulnerability of confined water as the existing groundwater vulnerability assessment methods are greatly influenced by subjectivity the purpose of this study is to put forward w f pnn method to avoid subjectivity weber fechner w f law in psychophysics and probabilistic neural network pnn are combined in this paper w f law is a theory for describing the people s response to a stimulus which is used to calculate the cluster center and determine the assessment standard probabilistic neural network is a widely used algorithm for classification which is used to classify the vulnerability of confined water according to the influence factors of confined water the assessment parameters d3a2c2 were determined and the vulnerability of confined water in plain area of xi an city in 2005 was assessed by w f pnn method and were divided into four categories the vulnerability of confined water gradually reduces from the flood plain the first terrace the second terrace the third terrace the alluvial fan to the loess tableland results of vulnerability assessment were validated by nitrate concentration in 2016 over the area the results show that the distribution of vulnerability region is mostly consistent with that of nitrate concentration region the w f pnn method does not assign rate but calculate the cluster center and not need to assign weight for parameters avoiding subjectivity is a reliable method for groundwater vulnerability assessment and suitable for the area with insufficient data keywords weber fechner law probabilistic neural network groundwater vulnerability drastic xi an 1 introduction according to the 2018 china water resources bulletin in the north of china the amount of groundwater supply is 0 877 1011 m3 accounting for 89 8 of the total groundwater supply in china 46 9 of the 2833 monitoring wells in china is within the ⅴ grade of the standard for groundwater quality gb t 14848 2017 general administration of quality supervision 2017 the 2011 china water resources bulletin shows that there are 4 confined water depression cones with more than 100 m depth one of them is xi an urban area funnel therefore it is very crucial to protect groundwater especially the confined water an effective work is to assess the groundwater vulnerability the assessment of confined water vulnerability will enable to delineate areas vulnerable to pollution and take suitable precautionary measures to protect and prevent overexploitation albinet and margat first proposed the concept of groundwater vulnerability in 1970 albinet and margat 1970 since then vrba and zaporotec 1994 brindha and elango 2015 us epa 1993 popescu et al 2008 hadžić et al 2015 have explained and supplemented the concept of groundwater vulnerability groundwater vulnerability is termed as the possibility of percolation and diffusion of pollutants from the ground surface into aquifer including intrinsic and specific vulnerability national research council 1993 intrinsic vulnerability of an aquifer can be defined as the ease with which a contaminant introduced onto the ground surface can reach and diffuse in groundwater vrba and zaporozec 1994 specific vulnerability is used to define the vulnerability of groundwater to particular contaminants or a group of contaminants by taking into account physicochemical properties and relationships of contaminants gogu and dassargues 2000 intrinsic vulnerability is a function of hydrogeological conditions and specific vulnerability addresses the vulnerability to a particular pollutant of interest or from specific source brindha and elango 2015 the intrinsic vulnerability is studied in this paper only most studies mainly focuses on phreatic aquifer if there is hydraulic exchange between phreatic aquifer and confined aquifer the pollutants in phreatic water may penetrate to the confined aquifer through the aquitard thus the confined water will be polluted zhong 2005 wu et al 2006 meng et al 2013 barzegar et al 2018 nadiri et al 2017 2018 yan et al 2019 so it is necessary to assess the pollution possibility of confined aquifer considering water quantity and quality it can be divided into water quantity vulnerability and water quality vulnerability water quantity vulnerability refers to the sensitivity and resilience of aquifers in different areas to the same degree of exploitation at a certain time water quality vulnerability refers to the sensitivity and resilience of aquifers in different areas to the same degree of pollutant discharge at a certain time currently most studies focus on the vulnerability assessment of water quality the vulnerability of groundwater quantity has been assessed in goghat i and ii blocks of west bengal by a number of different methods i e mcda ahp fuzzy logic and ensemble method das and pal 2020 due to lack of sufficient data only the quality vulnerability of confined water in xi an was assessed in this paper currently methods for groundwater vulnerability assessment are as follows drastic aller et al 1985 god foster 1987 avi van stempvoort et al 1993 sintacs civita 1994 isis civita and deregibus 1995 seepage navulur 1996 epik doerfliger and zwahlen 1997 pi goldscheider et al 2000 riske petelet giraud et al 2000 cop daly et al 2002 jones et al 2019 timeinput kralik and keimel 2003 gla method kuisi et al 2014 galdit bordbar et al 2019 and apsu popescu et al 2019 have been introduced to evaluate groundwater vulnerability among these approaches the drastic method is one of the most reliable effective easy to use and widely used approaches in determining the degree of intrinsic groundwater vulnerability barzegar et al 2019a drastic method is composed of a numerical ranking system which is used to assess the groundwater pollution potential for each of the seven parameters this system has three components ranges ratings and weights pedreira et al 2015 however differences in the groundwater vulnerability for different aquifers are due to differences in hydrogeological characteristics and settings barzegar et al 2018 fakhri et al 2015 in addition the subjectivity of experts may distort the vulnerability assessment of drastic yang et al 2017 pacheco et al 2015 liang et al 2019 drastic needs to be improved the reasons are summarized as follows first the number of assessment parameters should not be limited to 7 and can be changed according to the study object wu et al 2017 added surface water system and underground engineering to drastic to evaluate the vulnerability of groundwater in jinshan district of shanghai city xue et al 2017 pointed out that replacing aquifer media a with aquifer thickness m can achieve better evaluation results due to lack of sufficient data the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer in the drastic was removed by al adamat et al 2003 brindha and elango 2015 compared the drastic with other four methods extended from it added land use parameter to consider the impact of increased ground surface pollution sources on groundwater vulnerability if groundwater in karst area is evaluated the parameters should be adjusted zhang et al 2017 moreno gomez et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 so according to whether the data is sufficient and the study object we can appropriately adjust the parameters of drastic to find the suitable assessment parameters for the study area second there is subjectivity in assigning rate for each assessment parameter the range of the same parameter and its corresponding rate is different in different articles and assigning rate is also lack of sufficient basis small changes near the threshold will lead to large changes in the rate taking hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer as an example in the article of bojórquez tapia et al 2009 when the hydraulic conductivity is 20 3 m day the rate is 4 when it is 28 5 m day the rate is 5 in the article of pedreira et al 2015 when it is 15 35 m day the rate is 4 when it is 35 50 m day the rate is 6 it can be seen that for the same rate 4 the corresponding range of hydraulic conductivity is different and why the rate is 4 instead of other values also has subjectivity in addition in the article of pedreira et al 2015 when the hydraulic conductivity is 35 m day the rate is 4 when 35 1 m day the rate is 6 small changes near the threshold leads to large changes in the rate third there is subjectivity in determining the number of categories for the classification drastic divides the groundwater vulnerability evaluation results into 8 grades bojórquez tapia et al 2009 aller et al 1987 according to china geological survey groundwater vulnerability is divided into 10 grades china geological survey 2006 groundwater vulnerability grades often lack logical consistency resulting in groundwater vulnerability that may involve an excessive number of grades with arbitrary value ranges kim and hamm 1999 babiker et al 2005 because these results are difficult to grasp by decision makers and lay people they often fail to convey a clear geospatial meaning for policymaking and thus end up being unpersuasive and politically unfeasible to implement therefore one challenge in groundwater vulnerability is how to attain appropriate number of categories that are congruent with the capacity of humans for receiving processing remembering and transmitting information bojórquez tapia et al 2009 bojórquez tapia et al 2009 found that the number of grades can be determined according to people s sensitivity to grades that is a certain number of grades can make people feel obvious about the differences at all grades too many grades will not increase this difference but will reduce it after gauss residual analysis the appropriate classification number is determined to be 4 bojórquez tapia et al 2009 so in this paper 4 is the appropriate classification number for the groundwater vulnerability pedreira et al 2015 classified groundwater vulnerability into 4 grades with galdit method fourth there is certain subjectivity in determining the threshold range of comprehensive evaluation index drastic index or groundwater vulnerability index rate is used to quantify the parameter s ranges media concerning the possibility of groundwater contamination and is multiplied by its own weight then the comprehensive evaluation index is obtained however when the comprehensive evaluation index is also divided into five categories the threshold ranges are different for example the threshold value adopted by zheng et al 2004 is 100 100 120 120 140 140 160 and 160 the threshold value adopted by fan and yang 2007 is 20 20 39 40 59 60 79 and 80 hamza et al 2015 summarized the threshold range of comprehensive evaluation index of 30 scholars in list when using the drastic method for classification it can be seen that the thresholds are different due to different study areas there is no specific basis in most of the references to determine the threshold range there has a certain degree of subjectivity fifth in the process of determining the weight of each parameter there is a degree of subjectivity brindha and elango 2015 compared the weights of five methods the weights of d r and a parameters are 5 4 and 3 which are the same the weights of s t i and c parameters are different single parameter sensitivity analysis spsa neshat and pradhan 2015 rajput et al 2020 ahp huang et al 2017 sener and davraz 2012 neshat and pradhan 2015 sahoo et al 2016 jafari and nikoo 2016 jhariya et al 2019 discriminant analysis liang et al 2016 jang et al 2016 genetic algorithm ga jafari and nikoo 2016 yang et al 2017 projection pursuit dynamic clustering ppdc jia et al 2019 artificial intelligence ai or similar techniques nadiri et al 2019 and generalized reduced gradient grg rajput et al 2020 methods have been used to optimize the weights of the drastic method barzegar et al 2019a the subjectivity of the weight assignment was reduced by these methods there have been studies of assessing the vulnerability of confined aquifers but most of them need to assign weight zhong 2005 proposed the dlct model which assessed the vulnerability of confined aquifer by assigning rate and weight wu et al 2006 combined artificial neural networks and geographic information system to calculate the weight meng et al 2013 obtained the weight from the available value of data reflecting the information entropy and there has certain subjectivity in determining the threshold range of comprehensive evaluation index barzegar et al 2018 improved drastic method by adjusting the vulnerability parameters with nitrate concentrations nadiri et al 2017 formulates scfl models to study vulnerability of multiple aquifers both unconfined and confined by integrating the basic drastic framework with multiple models overarched by artificial neural networks ann nadiri et al 2018 used the drastic to study confined and unconfined aquifers vulnerability by using fuzzy catastrophe framework fcf to set the values of the rates and weights yan et al 2019 described a vebhat method to assess the vulnerability of confined aquifers the fo topsis method was used to determine the weights of assessment factors and to reduce subjectivity of the weight assignment furthermore the d in drastic is 1 52 30 48 m for confined aquifers nadiri et al 2018 when the value of d for confined water is greater than 30 48 m drastic is not suitable to sum up modification of the drastic method is important to overcoming subjectivity problems and has shown that rate and weight modifications based on local hydrogeological characteristics and settings provide more accurate vulnerability map barzegar et al 2019a the disadvantage of most modified drastic methods is that nitrate concentrations were used to modify the ratings and weights of the drastic parameters and also used to verify the result of drastic it seems inappropriate to use the same set of data to modify and verify a method therefore w f pnn method was proposed in this paper which can assess confined water vulnerability without assigning rate and weight and avoiding subjectivity weber fechner w f law is used to determine the assessment standard which consists of cluster centers not thresholds not assign rate for each parameter but calculate the cluster center probabilistic neural network pnn is used to classify which does not need to determine the weight of each parameter avoiding subjectivity w f law and pnn were used to assess unconfined water vulnerability by dong et al 2013 but w f pnn method was not proposed and the evaluation framework was incomplete in that article presently there are no other studies that using both weber fechner law and probabilistic neural network in this study w f pnn method was used to evaluate confined water vulnerability because it is useful in regions with insufficient data avoids to assign rate for each parameter uses cluster centers to classify not thresholds and not need to determine the weight of each parameter avoids subjectivity the current research was carried out in the plain area of xi an city in addition the nitrate concentration in groundwater is considered an indicator of groundwater quality degradation us environmental protection agency 1996 the correlation between nitrate concentration and the vulnerability degree of groundwater was used as an indicator of the reliability and accuracy of the applied methods huan et al 2012 kazakis and voudouris 2015 boufekane and saighi 2018 khosravi et al 2018 singha et al 2019 jhariya et al 2019 therefore the nitrate concentration is used to verify the accuracy of groundwater vulnerability assessment in this paper this paper is organized as follows first according to the influencing factors of confined water and the data can be obtained in the study area the assessment parameters are selected second the maximum and minimum values are selected from the data of each parameter and then the cluster center i e the classification center of each parameter is calculated by weber fechner law to determine the assessment standard of groundwater vulnerability third according to the assessment standard probabilistic neural network is used to classify for getting the vulnerability of confined water finally the nitrate concentration is used to verify vulnerability classification the reliability of w f pnn method is analyzed 2 methods 2 1 vulnerability assessment parameters of confined water d3a2c2 the assessment parameters of confined water vulnerability are determined from the influencing factors of supply runoff and discharge of confined water the water level of phreatic water and confined water influence the complementary relationship between them the buried depth of aquifer determines the migration path length of pollutants they can be considered as d of drastic the thickness of aquifer affects its water storage capacity and self purification ability the hydraulic conductivity affects the migration velocity of pollutants the hydraulic conductivity of aquifer in different media is different so the thickness of aquifer and hydraulic conductivity can be used as indications of the media type of aquifer a of drastic in case of waterhead difference the aquitard may be a channel of the hydraulic exchange for phreatic water and confined water which can be regarded as s of drastic however since no data of the aquitard has been collected in this paper this influencing factor can only be abandoned confined water is less influenced by precipitation vadose zone and topography therefore the r i t of drastic are not selected for confined water considering the above reasons and the data can be obtained the vulnerability assessment parameters of confined water are determined as follows depth of phreatic water level depth of confined water level depth of confined aquifer thickness of phreatic aquifer thickness of confined aquifer hydraulic conductivity of phreatic aquifer and hydraulic conductivity of confined aquifer namely d3a2c2 the relationship between the assessment parameters and the vulnerability of confined water is analyzed as follows depth of phreatic water level it determines the migration path length of pollutants to the phreatic aquifer and the time of contact with surrounding vadose zone media as well as the possibility of pollutants contacting with oxygen in soil pore resulting in oxidation therefore the deeper the phreatic water level is the longer time the pollutants reach the phreatic aquifer and the more they are absorbed and degraded the less likely the phreatic aquifer is to be contaminated depth of confined water level refers to the vertical distance between the confined water level and the surface equal to the surface elevation minus the confined water level which can be positive or negative generally positive the greater the buried depth of the confined water level the farther away from the surface the less likely the confined water is to be polluted and the lower the vulnerability depth of confined aquifer refers to the vertical distance between the top of the confined aquifer and the surface equal to the surface elevation minus the top elevation of the confined aquifer the buried depth determines the migration path of pollutants to the aquifer and the possibility of pollutants contacting with oxygen in soil pore resulting in oxidation therefore the greater the buried depth the longer time of pollutants reach to the aquifer the more pollutants are absorbed and degraded the less possibility of confined water to be polluted and the lower the vulnerability thickness of phreatic aquifer the greater the thickness of phreatic aquifer the smaller the relative range of pollution the greater the amount of pollutants absorbed or degraded and the lower the vulnerability of phreatic water so the lower the vulnerability of confined water thickness of confined aquifer the greater the thickness of confined aquifer the smaller the relative range of pollution the greater the amount of pollutants adsorbed or degraded and the lower the vulnerability of confined water hydraulic conductivity of phreatic aquifer the smaller the hydraulic conductivity of phreatic aquifer the smaller the migration velocity of pollutants in the aquifer the smaller the pollution diffusion range the less the possibility of pollution and the lower the polluted possibility of confined aquifer hydraulic conductivity of confined aquifer the smaller the hydraulic conductivity of confined aquifer the smaller the migration velocity of pollutants in the aquifer the smaller the pollution diffusion range and the lower the vulnerability of confined water 2 2 application of the weber fechner law in vulnerability assessment of confined water 2 2 1 the weber fechner w f law psychophysics is a subdiscipline of experimental psychology that describes the psychological response of people to variation of a physical stimulus montello 2002 w f law is the basis of psychophysics and describes the relationship between physical magnitudes of stimuli and the perceived intensity of the stimuli in recent years w f law is successfully applied in the formulation of ambient air quality standards li and peng 2003 residential indoor environment quality evaluation wei et al 2016 the sensitivity of the odour perception of the individual substances wu et al 2016 odor impact criteria huang and guo 2018 sensory sweetness definition for sugars mao et al 2019 etc however the application of w f law in the field of groundwater is relatively rare especially in the vulnerability of confined water bojórquez tapia et al 2009 based the categorization of groundwater vulnerability on the w f law with the use of w f law and fuzzy pattern recognition could produce results that are congruent with peoples ability to receive process and remember information 1834 weber formulated a law that established that for the just noticeable difference a given intensity of stimulation was proportional to the original stimulus lanzara 1994 remarkably similar results were discovered for sound light smell and taste stimuli then the ratio 1 r jnd s where r is a constant jnd is the just noticeable difference for discrimination s is the magnitude of a stimulus but fechner founded that when the dose of a chemical drug or hormone is administered the response is not linearly related to the dose rather it is the logarithm of the dose versus the response that most nearly describes the dose response relationship lanzara 1994 so fechner joint acceptance of weber s law plus the assumption that all jnd s have equal subjective size leads to a simple logarithmic rule relating the level of sensation to the stimuli 2 jnd a log s b where a and b are constants eq 2 is the w f law derivative of s on both sides of the formula then 3 djnd ds a ln 10 s multiply ds on both sides 4 djnd a ln 10 s d s so while s increases following a geometric series jnd varies as an arithmetic series 2 2 2 w f law and confined water d3a2c2 in this paper the value of vulnerability parameter can be regarded as the magnitude of a stimulus s the vulnerability categories can be regarded as the just noticeable difference for discrimination namely jnd the relationship between the vulnerability parameters and vulnerability categories accord with w f law when the magnitude of a stimulus s the value of vulnerability parameter changes in equal ratio sequence jnd vulnerability category changes in equal difference the general formula of the series of equal ratio numbers is 5 s n s 0 q n where s n is the magnitude of a stimulus the value of a vulnerability assessment parameter of confined water s 0 is the minimum magnitude of a stimulus the minimum value of a certain confined water vulnerability assessment parameter value q is the common ratio of the equal ratio series namely the common ratio of the magnitude of a stimulus n is the confined water vulnerability category which changes in the sequence of equal difference it can be seen that when s changes in equal ratio n changes in equal difference which conforms to w f law similar statements appear in bojórquez tapia s article eqs 13 and 14 in bojórquez tapia s article are s h s 1 r s h 1 s h s 1 r h s 0 from the above two formulas 6 s h 1 s 0 1 r h 1 where h is groundwater vulnerability categories r is a constant the initial stimulus s0 represents the absolute threshold or the smallest detectable level of a stimulus bojórquez tapia et al 2009 it can be seen that eqs 5 and 6 have similar forms for a specific proportional sequence q is a constant and 1 r is a constant therefore eq 5 conforms to w f law eq 5 can be used to express the relationship between the vulnerability assessment parameter value of confined water and the vulnerability category if vulnerability is divided into four categories then n 0 1 2 4 from eq 5 it can be seen that q i s in s i 0 1 n s i max s i min 1 n max s i 4 s i 0 1 4 where q i is the common ratio of a confined water vulnerability parameter i s i max is the maximum value of a confined water vulnerability parameter s i max s i 4 s i 0 is the minimum value of a confined water vulnerability parameter s i min s i 0 0 s i 0 s i 1 s i 2 s i 3 s i 4 are the center value of vulnerability category of a parameter that is the cluster center of probabilistic neural network pnn corresponding to different classification categories from the most unfavorable point of view make the following assumptions for the parameter with the smaller value and the lower vulnerability s i 1 s i 2 s i 3 s i 4 were selected as the cluster center of l m h vh i ii iii iv such parameters include hydraulic conductivity of phreatic aquifer and hydraulic conductivity of confined aquifer for the parameter with the higher value and the lower vulnerability s i 3 s i 2 s i 1 s i 0 were selected as the cluster center of l m h vh i ii iii iv such parameters include depth of phreatic water level thickness of phreatic aquifer depth of confined aquifer thickness of confined aquifer and depth of confined water level different classification numbers correspond to different n if it is divided into five categories then n max 5 according to the w f law n 0 1 5 and then according to the formula q i s i max s i min 1 n max s i 5 s i 0 1 5 which can determine the center value of each category of vulnerability parameter it can be seen that after the vulnerability parameter is selected the assessment standard can be determined by w f law according to the maximum and minimum value of the assessment parameter in the study area the shortcoming of this method is that more original data are needed to get the maximum and minimum values but there are many assessment sub regions in groundwater vulnerability assessment which can overcome this shortcoming and meet the requirements of w f law so w f law can be applied to the vulnerability assessment of confined water 2 3 probabilistic neural network probabilistic neural network pnn is proposed by specht d f in 1989 based on the radial basis network the density function estimation and bayesian decision theory are integrated under some conditions that are easy to meet the decision boundary realized by pnn gradually approaches the bayesian best decision surface pnn has successfully solved all kinds of engineering problems in various fields since it is proposed yi et al 2016 it is also applied in the field of water quality classification dong et al 2009 chen et al 2004 but its application for classification problem in groundwater vulnerability assessment is rare back propagation bp neural network method was used to evaluate groundwater vulnerability by dixon 2001 but bp network is not as suitable as pnn in classification pnn is composed of input layer sample layer summation layer and competition layer su and song 2011 the first layer is the input layer and the number of neurons is the dimension of eigenvector the euclidean distance is calculated between the input vector and all the training samples to be identified the second layer is the sample layer the number of neurons is the number of training samples to be identified the activation function of sample layer is gaussian function the third layer is the summation layer and the number of neurons is the number of categories the output of the sample layer is added by grade if the output of the sample layer is divided into 4 grades it is equivalent to 4 adders the last layer is the competition layer and the number of neurons is 1 the result of the decision is output by the competition layer the output of the grade with the highest probability is 1 and the other results are 0 the newpnn function provided by matlab can be used to design pnn conveniently the statement to establish the network is net newpnn p t spread p is the input vector t is the output vector spread is the distribution density of radial basis function in the pnn spread has a great influence on its performance if it is improperly selected the pnn will produce bad prediction results it is difficult to select the optimal manually yi et al 2016 for better analysis of the influence of spread on network performance the spread value is trained and the best one is selected from 0 1 2 3 1 pnn and confined water vulnerability the core of building pnn is to use assessment standard to determine the input vector which is directly used for pattern classification the assessment parameter data unknown mode is used as the training samples namely the cluster centers of each parameter calculated by w f law are used as the input vector and the parameter data of each regions in the study area are used as the training samples after calculating by pnn the one with output 1 corresponds to the vulnerability category of the region in this paper w f law and pnn are combined to propose a w f pnn method for vulnerability assessment of confined water 2 3 2 normalization to prevent variables with large numerical ranges dominating those with smaller numerical ranges in the models and also to speed up the model training process and convergence during training the input variables should be scaled prior to model calibration barzegar et al 2019b assessment standard and the parameter data of each regions were scaled using the maximum and minimum values of the parameter data in the study area furthermore as the accuracy of neural network training and prediction of 0 1 data is high it is necessary to normalize the input data the deviation standardization method is used to make linear transformation of the original data so the result value is mapped between 0 1 the conversion function is as follows 7 r ij x ij min 1 i n x ij max 1 i n x ij min 1 i n x ij where x ij is the original data of row i column j max 1 i n x ij is the maximum value of column j min 1 i n x ij is the minimum value of column j r ij is the data of row i and column j after normalization i 1 2 n j 1 2 m 3 case study 3 1 division of study area xi an is bounded by 107 40 109 49 e and 33 42 34 45 n it is about 204 km from the east to the west and 116 km from the south to the north it is the most open area of wei river valley the total land area of the city is 9983 km2 of which the plain area is 4481 km2 xi an has a clear boundary of geomorphic from south to north qinling mountains loess hills loess tableland alluvial fan plain wei river and tributary terrace alluvial plain according to the administrative divisions and geomorphic characteristics the plain area of xi an can be divided into 30 sub regions table 1 and fig 1 show the division the shallow confined water with a buried depth of 300 m in plain area of xi an city is taken as the research object the formation lithology is mainly composed of gravel sand silt silty clay and loess li et al 2002 it is mainly supplied by leakage recharge from overlaying phreatic water department of geology and mineral resources of shaanxi province 1999 the confined water is distributed under the phreatic water bearing formation of each geomorphic unit in the plain area which is composed of quaternary middle and lower pleistocene lacustrine proluvial alluvial gravel and pebble medium coarse and fine sand and sandy loam in the front of the mountain it is mainly proluvial in the loess tableland it is mainly proluvial in the first and second terrace of wei river it is mainly lacustrine the lithology has a certain change rule in the horizontal direction in the near piedmont area the particles are coarse thick and muddy the grain size between the fans and the leading edge becomes smaller the layer decreases and the thickness becomes thinner 3 2 application of w f pnn method 3 2 1 data table 1 shows the division of xi an city in geomorphology there is a well in each sub region as a representative point in this region 30 confined water wells are collected the data of water level and buried depth are from the environmental monitoring station of shaanxi province and the dynamic report of groundwater in 2005 jiao et al 2006 the data of the hydraulic conductivity and the thickness of the confined aquifer are from the groundwater resources exploration report of xi an area no 1 hydrogeological engineering geological team bureau of geology and mineral exploration and development of shaanxi province 1988 3 2 2 determination of vulnerability assessment standard for confined water based on the results of bojórquez tapia et al 2009 the vulnerability of groundwater is divided into four categories they are named l low m moderate h high and vh very high with corresponding grades of l ⅰ m ii h iii vh iv according to the discussion in 2 2 2 w f law and confined water d3a2c2 the assessment standard of confined water vulnerability is determined namely the cluster center of each parameter was calculated and the results are shown in table 2 q i is the common ratio of the confined water parameter i take the first vulnerability parameter the depth of phreatic water level as an example q 1 s in s i 0 1 n s 1 max s 1 min 1 4 s 14 s

are calculated in turn as mentioned in 2 2 2 from the most unfavorable point of view for the parameter with the smaller value and the lower vulnerability s i 1 s i 2 s i 3 s i 4 are selected as the cluster center for l m h vh i ii iii iv for the parameter with the higher value and the lower vulnerability s i 3 s i 2 s i 1 s i 0 are selected as the cluster center of l m h vh i ii iii iv among the seven parameters in d3a2c2 for the parameter with the smaller value and the lower vulnerability there are two parameters hydraulic conductivity of phreatic aquifer and hydraulic conductivity of confined aquifer for the parameter with higher value and lower vulnerability there are five parameters depth of phreatic water level thickness of phreatic aquifer depth of confined aquifer thickness of confined aquifer and depth of confined water level according to this principle the cluster center and assessment standard of confined water vulnerability are listed in table 3 there are four cluster centers corresponding to each parameter for example depth of phreatic water level the cluster centers of l low m moderate h high vh very high are 32 5 m 12 8 m 5 1 m and 2 0 m 3 2 3 construction and application of pnn 1 determination and normalization of input vector p the vulnerability assessment standard of confined water is the input vector p which is the data in table 3 eq 7 was used to normalize the standard p 32 5 12 8 5 1 2 0 51 0 17 3 5 9 2 0 129 4 83 7 54 1 35 0 47 6 28 3 16 8 10 0 90 6 54 8 33 1 20 0 2 7 7 1 18 8 50 0 2 4 5 9 14 4 35 0 0 38 0 13 0 04 0 00 0 33 0 10

vulnerability assessment of confined water the number of neurons in the summation layer i e the vulnerability category 4 the training sample vector to be identified in the sample layer also needs to be normalized the euclidean distance between the input vector p and all the training sample vectors to be identified is calculated in the input layer 2 determination of output vector of network target t the output vector of the competition layer is represented by t if it is divided into four categories then t is a unit matrix with 4 4 row vector in t respectively corresponds to the response state of evaluation grade i ii iii and iv in the network output layer for the groundwater vulnerability assessment t 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 the competition layer takes the largest one in the summation layer as the output category its output is 1 and the output of other neurons is 0 if the output of the second row of the t matrix is 1 for a certain sub region then this sub region of the study area belongs to the confined water vulnerability category ii namely m moderate 3 application of pnn all parameter values of 30 sub regions are normalized compared with the assessment standard p and the euclidean distance is calculated to classify the vulnerability the output result of pnn is the vulnerability assessment result of 30 sub regions table 4 and fig 1 are the vulnerability assessment results of confined water in plain area of xi an in 2005 the vulnerability is classified into four categories i e low moderate high and very high vulnerability based on w f law as suggested by bojórquez tapia et al 2009 4 results and discussion 4 1 statistical analysis of parameters the statistical analysis of confined water vulnerability parameters is helpful for acknowledging the law of variation of hydrogeological parameters table 5 shows the minimum maximum mean standard deviation sd and coefficient of variation cv for each parameter results show that the standard deviation of hydraulic conductivity of confined aquifer is the smallest with value of 9 91 m d indicates data aggregation the standard deviation of depth of confined water level is the largest with value of 42 12 m indicates data dispersion thickness and hydraulic conductivity of confined aquifer are less than phreatic aquifer thickness with average values of 25 5 m and 85 m hydraulic conductivity with average values of 18 m d and 45 m d respectively additionally spatial variations of depth of phreatic water level depth of confined water level thickness of confined aquifer and hydraulic conductivity of confined aquifer are large which can be identified by cv higher than 50 4 2 the vulnerability of the confined water fig 1 shows that the vulnerability of the confined water in the plain area of xi an city gradually reduces from the flood plain the first terrace the second terrace the third terrace the alluvial fan to the loess tableland and the confined water quality is more and more difficult to be polluted loess tableland areas were mostly low vulnerability regions second and third terrace or proluvial fan were mostly moderate vulnerability regions first and second terrace were mostly high vulnerability regions the flood plain of wei river were mostly very high vulnerability regions the characteristics of each sub region are as follows there are seven low vulnerability regions most of which were distributed in loess tableland areas the sub region number 5 no 5 is the water source of ba river the buried depth of phreatic water at the representative point is relatively deep 34 27 m the thickness of confined aquifer is 130 m the hydraulic conductivity of confined aquifer is 12 m d most of the parameter data are close to the cluster center with low vulnerability and the possibility of aquifer pollution is small no 9 13 17 18 21 and 25 are loess tableland areas which are located in shenhe tableland shaoling tableland bailuyuan of lantian county lanmei tableland of zhouzhi county and ma e tableland of lintong district the hydraulic conductivity of phreatic aquifer is small the buried depth of the roof of confined aquifer is greater than 100 m the buried depth of phreatic water and confined water level is large the possibility of the confined aquifer being polluted is small there are few restrictions on pollutant discharge in low vulnerability regions but it is not allowed to discharge blindly there are eight moderate vulnerability regions most of which are distributed in first second and third terrace or proluvial fan no 24 and 29 of the regions are proluvial fan which are located in zhouzhi country and huyi district respectively the buried depth of phreatic water level is about 30 m the buried depth of the roof of confined aquifer is about 35 40 m and the thickness of confined aquifer is 40 50 m no 3 4 12 15 and 20 are second and third terrace which are located in chang an district city six district and lantian county the hydraulic conductivity of confined aquifer is similar which is 7 9 m d and the thickness of confined aquifer is about 30 40 m among them no 3 and 12 are located in second terrace and each parameter value is near the standard value of moderate vulnerability no 15 is located in second and third terrace and the buried depth of phreatic water level is about 20 m and the buried depth of confined water level is about 16 m although the buried depth of water level is shallow but the hydraulic conductivity of phreatic aquifer is smaller about 11 m d so the vulnerability is moderate no 20 is located in the third terrace the buried depth of phreatic water level is shallow 20 m but the buried depth of the roof of confined aquifer is 95 m so the vulnerability is moderate no 4 is located in the southern suburb of xi an city although the buried depth of phreatic water level is shallow but because of the excessive exploitation of the confined water in the suburb for many years the water level of confined water at this point drops to 130 m although no 4 is located in the third terrace the water supply condition of the confined water is better than that of the loess tableland however due to the large amount of groundwater exploitation the buried depth of confined water level in 2005 is large and the pollutant migration path is long no 4 belongs to the moderate vulnerable area no 8 is located in the first terrace with the buried depth of phreatic water level of 18 24 m the buried depth of the roof of confined aquifer of 70 m the thickness of confined aquifer of 60 m and the buried depth of confined water level of 106 m it can be seen that the buried depth of confined water level is relatively large and the thickness of the aquifer is moderate which is a moderate vulnerable area therefore the discharge of pollutants in this area should be limited there are eleven high vulnerability regions with no 2 7 10 11 14 16 19 23 27 28 and 30 which distributed in all administrative regions most of them are located in flood plain and first and second terrace the buried depth of phreatic water and confined water level is shallow the hydraulic conductivity of aquifer is large the hydraulic conductivity of phreatic aquifer is about 25 35 m d that of confined aquifer is 10 25 m d and the buried depth of confined aquifer roof is 40 90 m no 16 is a alluvial fan which is located in the front of the loess tableland in chang an district although the hydraulic conductivity of phreatic aquifer is small about 10 m d but the buried depth of phreatic water and confined water level are shallow and the buried depth of the roof of confined aquifer is about 40 m so no 16 belongs to the high vulnerability area the high vulnerability area should be protected and the pollutant discharge should be strictly controlled there are four very high vulnerability regions all of which are located in the flood plain no 1 6 22 and 26 which are respectively located in city six district feng and zao river water source area zhouzhi county and huyi district in these areas the phreatic water and confined water supply conditions are good the phreatic water buried depth is shallow and the hydraulic conductivities of phreatic water and confined aquifer are large over 30 m d most of the groundwater exploitation is near the river the cycle of groundwater recharge and discharge is fast which is the most likely to cause pollutant diffusion it belongs to the area with very high vulnerability therefore a protection zone should be established to prohibit the discharge of pollutants in very high vulnerability regions 4 3 verification the vulnerability assessment of groundwater in this paper is based on the following assumptions the pollutant discharge in each region is the same due to the difference of pollutant discharge in different regions in reality and the vulnerability of confined water has not been studied in xi an before it is difficult to verify refer to other articles the vulnerability assessment results of confined water were verified by nitrate concentration over the area in this paper as the confined water in the study area is mainly supplied by phreatic water and the lack of nitrate concentration data of confined water the nitrate concentration in phreatic water were used to verify the confined water vulnerability the nitrate concentrations of 18 phreatic wells in xi an were measured from october to december 2016 meng et al 2018 and marked in fig 1 the data is from the national infrastructure project national groundwater monitoring project fig 2 shows the correlation between vulnerability of confined water for sub regions and nitrate concentration by comparing the nitrate concentration in 2016 meng et al 2018 with the confined water vulnerability in 2005 fig 1 and fig 2 it can be seen that in low vulnerability regions the nitrate concentration was less than 5 mg l no 18 however the nitrate concentration in no 13 is 7 95 mg l no 13 belongs to lintong district in 2005 the ammonia nitrogen concentration of the river water in this region was 2 75 mg l total nitrogen concentration was 10 20 mg l lang et al 2009 therefore groundwater in this region has a higher nitrate concentration than 5 mg l which was attributed to the river water infiltration in the moderate vulnerability regions the nitrate concentrations ranged between 3 76 and 5 23 mg l less than 10 mg l in high vulnerability regions the nitrate concentration of four regions were greater than 10 mg l two of them were greater than 20 mg l the nitrate concentration in no 7 was 0 11 0 22 mg l as no 7 was weibin water source the very high vulnerability regions were mostly located in the flood plain the nitrate concentration was less than 10 mg l for example no 1 close to moderate vulnerability region no 2 if protection measures are not adopted the nitrate concentration in this area is easier to increase than other regions according to the nitrate concentration meng et al 2018 the nitrate concentration in most wells of chang an district is less than 5 mg l in zhouzhi country huyi district is less than or equal to 5 mg l in city six district is 0 11 5 39 mg l in yanliang district is 14 53 mg l in lintong district is 3 68 23 87 mg l in gaoling district is 23 64 mg l in the standard for groundwater quality gb t 14848 2017 general administration of quality supervision 2017 the nitrate concentration is 20 mg l for iii grade and beyond this range it is harmful lintong district and gaoling district locate in the north of wei river the nitrate concentration exceeds 20 mg l for iii grade of the standard for groundwater quality gb t 14848 2017 these regions just right belong to the high vulnerability region so there are some correlations between vulnerability and nitrate concentration the distribution of high vulnerability region is mostly consistent with that of high nitrate concentration region except some protected regions such as water source or serious pollution of river water the nitrate concentration after 11 years can verify the rationality of the vulnerability assessment results of confined water in 2005 therefore the results of vulnerability assessment of confined water in 2005 is reasonable 5 conclusions considering water quantity and quality the groundwater vulnerability could be divided into water quantity vulnerability and water quality vulnerability the water quality vulnerability of confined water was studied in this paper according to the influencing factors of confined water d3a2c2 were determined which included seven parameters for vulnerability assessment of confined water a new method w f pnn method was proposed for groundwater vulnerability assessment from the perspective of people s easy recognition and memory the number of categories was 4 w f law was used to calculate the cluster center based on the minimum and maximum values of parameters in the study area then the assessment standard was determined people s feelings of external influence was quantified avoiding subjectivity and assigning rates for parameters pnn can avoid subjectivity caused by assigning weight in the classification process and was used to classify confined water vulnerability by calculating the distance between cluster center and data of the study area w f law and pnn were well combined in this paper and was called w f pnn method to assess the vulnerability of confined water in the plain area of xi an in 2005 the confined water vulnerability was divided into four categories which was easy for decision makers to make decisions there are seven low vulnerability regions eight moderate vulnerability regions eleven high vulnerability regions and four very high vulnerability regions for confined water in the plain area of xi an in 2005 the vulnerability of the confined water gradually reduced from the flood plain the first terrace the second terrace the third terrace the alluvial fan to the loess tableland the confined water vulnerability in 2005 was verified by nitrate concentration in 2016 the results showed that except for groundwater source the higher the vulnerability was the higher the concentration of nitrate was the distribution of high vulnerability region was mostly consistent with that of high nitrate concentration region so the assessment results of w f pnn method were reasonable w f pnn method can also be used to evaluate the vulnerability of phreatic water not only the vulnerability of confined water the parameters just need to be replaced by the parameters related to phreatic water the other steps are the same as those for confined water in addition due to insufficient data the data of each representative point were taken as the data of this sub region but the evaluation result basically conforms to the nitrate concentration which shows that w f pnn method is reliable in a word w f pnn method can avoid subjectivity in the process of groundwater vulnerability assessment and is suitable for the area with insufficient data credit authorship contribution statement yanhui dong writing original draft writing review editing weibo zhou writing

5179,at present groundwater vulnerability assessment is mainly aimed at phreatic aquifer but in most areas people draw water from confined aquifer so it is necessary to assess the vulnerability of confined water as the existing groundwater vulnerability assessment methods are greatly influenced by subjectivity the purpose of this study is to put forward w f pnn method to avoid subjectivity weber fechner w f law in psychophysics and probabilistic neural network pnn are combined in this paper w f law is a theory for describing the people s response to a stimulus which is used to calculate the cluster center and determine the assessment standard probabilistic neural network is a widely used algorithm for classification which is used to classify the vulnerability of confined water according to the influence factors of confined water the assessment parameters d3a2c2 were determined and the vulnerability of confined water in plain area of xi an city in 2005 was assessed by w f pnn method and were divided into four categories the vulnerability of confined water gradually reduces from the flood plain the first terrace the second terrace the third terrace the alluvial fan to the loess tableland results of vulnerability assessment were validated by nitrate concentration in 2016 over the area the results show that the distribution of vulnerability region is mostly consistent with that of nitrate concentration region the w f pnn method does not assign rate but calculate the cluster center and not need to assign weight for parameters avoiding subjectivity is a reliable method for groundwater vulnerability assessment and suitable for the area with insufficient data keywords weber fechner law probabilistic neural network groundwater vulnerability drastic xi an 1 introduction according to the 2018 china water resources bulletin in the north of china the amount of groundwater supply is 0 877 1011 m3 accounting for 89 8 of the total groundwater supply in china 46 9 of the 2833 monitoring wells in china is within the ⅴ grade of the standard for groundwater quality gb t 14848 2017 general administration of quality supervision 2017 the 2011 china water resources bulletin shows that there are 4 confined water depression cones with more than 100 m depth one of them is xi an urban area funnel therefore it is very crucial to protect groundwater especially the confined water an effective work is to assess the groundwater vulnerability the assessment of confined water vulnerability will enable to delineate areas vulnerable to pollution and take suitable precautionary measures to protect and prevent overexploitation albinet and margat first proposed the concept of groundwater vulnerability in 1970 albinet and margat 1970 since then vrba and zaporotec 1994 brindha and elango 2015 us epa 1993 popescu et al 2008 hadžić et al 2015 have explained and supplemented the concept of groundwater vulnerability groundwater vulnerability is termed as the possibility of percolation and diffusion of pollutants from the ground surface into aquifer including intrinsic and specific vulnerability national research council 1993 intrinsic vulnerability of an aquifer can be defined as the ease with which a contaminant introduced onto the ground surface can reach and diffuse in groundwater vrba and zaporozec 1994 specific vulnerability is used to define the vulnerability of groundwater to particular contaminants or a group of contaminants by taking into account physicochemical properties and relationships of contaminants gogu and dassargues 2000 intrinsic vulnerability is a function of hydrogeological conditions and specific vulnerability addresses the vulnerability to a particular pollutant of interest or from specific source brindha and elango 2015 the intrinsic vulnerability is studied in this paper only most studies mainly focuses on phreatic aquifer if there is hydraulic exchange between phreatic aquifer and confined aquifer the pollutants in phreatic water may penetrate to the confined aquifer through the aquitard thus the confined water will be polluted zhong 2005 wu et al 2006 meng et al 2013 barzegar et al 2018 nadiri et al 2017 2018 yan et al 2019 so it is necessary to assess the pollution possibility of confined aquifer considering water quantity and quality it can be divided into water quantity vulnerability and water quality vulnerability water quantity vulnerability refers to the sensitivity and resilience of aquifers in different areas to the same degree of exploitation at a certain time water quality vulnerability refers to the sensitivity and resilience of aquifers in different areas to the same degree of pollutant discharge at a certain time currently most studies focus on the vulnerability assessment of water quality the vulnerability of groundwater quantity has been assessed in goghat i and ii blocks of west bengal by a number of different methods i e mcda ahp fuzzy logic and ensemble method das and pal 2020 due to lack of sufficient data only the quality vulnerability of confined water in xi an was assessed in this paper currently methods for groundwater vulnerability assessment are as follows drastic aller et al 1985 god foster 1987 avi van stempvoort et al 1993 sintacs civita 1994 isis civita and deregibus 1995 seepage navulur 1996 epik doerfliger and zwahlen 1997 pi goldscheider et al 2000 riske petelet giraud et al 2000 cop daly et al 2002 jones et al 2019 timeinput kralik and keimel 2003 gla method kuisi et al 2014 galdit bordbar et al 2019 and apsu popescu et al 2019 have been introduced to evaluate groundwater vulnerability among these approaches the drastic method is one of the most reliable effective easy to use and widely used approaches in determining the degree of intrinsic groundwater vulnerability barzegar et al 2019a drastic method is composed of a numerical ranking system which is used to assess the groundwater pollution potential for each of the seven parameters this system has three components ranges ratings and weights pedreira et al 2015 however differences in the groundwater vulnerability for different aquifers are due to differences in hydrogeological characteristics and settings barzegar et al 2018 fakhri et al 2015 in addition the subjectivity of experts may distort the vulnerability assessment of drastic yang et al 2017 pacheco et al 2015 liang et al 2019 drastic needs to be improved the reasons are summarized as follows first the number of assessment parameters should not be limited to 7 and can be changed according to the study object wu et al 2017 added surface water system and underground engineering to drastic to evaluate the vulnerability of groundwater in jinshan district of shanghai city xue et al 2017 pointed out that replacing aquifer media a with aquifer thickness m can achieve better evaluation results due to lack of sufficient data the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer in the drastic was removed by al adamat et al 2003 brindha and elango 2015 compared the drastic with other four methods extended from it added land use parameter to consider the impact of increased ground surface pollution sources on groundwater vulnerability if groundwater in karst area is evaluated the parameters should be adjusted zhang et al 2017 moreno gomez et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 so according to whether the data is sufficient and the study object we can appropriately adjust the parameters of drastic to find the suitable assessment parameters for the study area second there is subjectivity in assigning rate for each assessment parameter the range of the same parameter and its corresponding rate is different in different articles and assigning rate is also lack of sufficient basis small changes near the threshold will lead to large changes in the rate taking hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer as an example in the article of bojórquez tapia et al 2009 when the hydraulic conductivity is 20 3 m day the rate is 4 when it is 28 5 m day the rate is 5 in the article of pedreira et al 2015 when it is 15 35 m day the rate is 4 when it is 35 50 m day the rate is 6 it can be seen that for the same rate 4 the corresponding range of hydraulic conductivity is different and why the rate is 4 instead of other values also has subjectivity in addition in the article of pedreira et al 2015 when the hydraulic conductivity is 35 m day the rate is 4 when 35 1 m day the rate is 6 small changes near the threshold leads to large changes in the rate third there is subjectivity in determining the number of categories for the classification drastic divides the groundwater vulnerability evaluation results into 8 grades bojórquez tapia et al 2009 aller et al 1987 according to china geological survey groundwater vulnerability is divided into 10 grades china geological survey 2006 groundwater vulnerability grades often lack logical consistency resulting in groundwater vulnerability that may involve an excessive number of grades with arbitrary value ranges kim and hamm 1999 babiker et al 2005 because these results are difficult to grasp by decision makers and lay people they often fail to convey a clear geospatial meaning for policymaking and thus end up being unpersuasive and politically unfeasible to implement therefore one challenge in groundwater vulnerability is how to attain appropriate number of categories that are congruent with the capacity of humans for receiving processing remembering and transmitting information bojórquez tapia et al 2009 bojórquez tapia et al 2009 found that the number of grades can be determined according to people s sensitivity to grades that is a certain number of grades can make people feel obvious about the differences at all grades too many grades will not increase this difference but will reduce it after gauss residual analysis the appropriate classification number is determined to be 4 bojórquez tapia et al 2009 so in this paper 4 is the appropriate classification number for the groundwater vulnerability pedreira et al 2015 classified groundwater vulnerability into 4 grades with galdit method fourth there is certain subjectivity in determining the threshold range of comprehensive evaluation index drastic index or groundwater vulnerability index rate is used to quantify the parameter s ranges media concerning the possibility of groundwater contamination and is multiplied by its own weight then the comprehensive evaluation index is obtained however when the comprehensive evaluation index is also divided into five categories the threshold ranges are different for example the threshold value adopted by zheng et al 2004 is 100 100 120 120 140 140 160 and 160 the threshold value adopted by fan and yang 2007 is 20 20 39 40 59 60 79 and 80 hamza et al 2015 summarized the threshold range of comprehensive evaluation index of 30 scholars in list when using the drastic method for classification it can be seen that the thresholds are different due to different study areas there is no specific basis in most of the references to determine the threshold range there has a certain degree of subjectivity fifth in the process of determining the weight of each parameter there is a degree of subjectivity brindha and elango 2015 compared the weights of five methods the weights of d r and a parameters are 5 4 and 3 which are the same the weights of s t i and c parameters are different single parameter sensitivity analysis spsa neshat and pradhan 2015 rajput et al 2020 ahp huang et al 2017 sener and davraz 2012 neshat and pradhan 2015 sahoo et al 2016 jafari and nikoo 2016 jhariya et al 2019 discriminant analysis liang et al 2016 jang et al 2016 genetic algorithm ga jafari and nikoo 2016 yang et al 2017 projection pursuit dynamic clustering ppdc jia et al 2019 artificial intelligence ai or similar techniques nadiri et al 2019 and generalized reduced gradient grg rajput et al 2020 methods have been used to optimize the weights of the drastic method barzegar et al 2019a the subjectivity of the weight assignment was reduced by these methods there have been studies of assessing the vulnerability of confined aquifers but most of them need to assign weight zhong 2005 proposed the dlct model which assessed the vulnerability of confined aquifer by assigning rate and weight wu et al 2006 combined artificial neural networks and geographic information system to calculate the weight meng et al 2013 obtained the weight from the available value of data reflecting the information entropy and there has certain subjectivity in determining the threshold range of comprehensive evaluation index barzegar et al 2018 improved drastic method by adjusting the vulnerability parameters with nitrate concentrations nadiri et al 2017 formulates scfl models to study vulnerability of multiple aquifers both unconfined and confined by integrating the basic drastic framework with multiple models overarched by artificial neural networks ann nadiri et al 2018 used the drastic to study confined and unconfined aquifers vulnerability by using fuzzy catastrophe framework fcf to set the values of the rates and weights yan et al 2019 described a vebhat method to assess the vulnerability of confined aquifers the fo topsis method was used to determine the weights of assessment factors and to reduce subjectivity of the weight assignment furthermore the d in drastic is 1 52 30 48 m for confined aquifers nadiri et al 2018 when the value of d for confined water is greater than 30 48 m drastic is not suitable to sum up modification of the drastic method is important to overcoming subjectivity problems and has shown that rate and weight modifications based on local hydrogeological characteristics and settings provide more accurate vulnerability map barzegar et al 2019a the disadvantage of most modified drastic methods is that nitrate concentrations were used to modify the ratings and weights of the drastic parameters and also used to verify the result of drastic it seems inappropriate to use the same set of data to modify and verify a method therefore w f pnn method was proposed in this paper which can assess confined water vulnerability without assigning rate and weight and avoiding subjectivity weber fechner w f law is used to determine the assessment standard which consists of cluster centers not thresholds not assign rate for each parameter but calculate the cluster center probabilistic neural network pnn is used to classify which does not need to determine the weight of each parameter avoiding subjectivity w f law and pnn were used to assess unconfined water vulnerability by dong et al 2013 but w f pnn method was not proposed and the evaluation framework was incomplete in that article presently there are no other studies that using both weber fechner law and probabilistic neural network in this study w f pnn method was used to evaluate confined water vulnerability because it is useful in regions with insufficient data avoids to assign rate for each parameter uses cluster centers to classify not thresholds and not need to determine the weight of each parameter avoids subjectivity the current research was carried out in the plain area of xi an city in addition the nitrate concentration in groundwater is considered an indicator of groundwater quality degradation us environmental protection agency 1996 the correlation between nitrate concentration and the vulnerability degree of groundwater was used as an indicator of the reliability and accuracy of the applied methods huan et al 2012 kazakis and voudouris 2015 boufekane and saighi 2018 khosravi et al 2018 singha et al 2019 jhariya et al 2019 therefore the nitrate concentration is used to verify the accuracy of groundwater vulnerability assessment in this paper this paper is organized as follows first according to the influencing factors of confined water and the data can be obtained in the study area the assessment parameters are selected second the maximum and minimum values are selected from the data of each parameter and then the cluster center i e the classification center of each parameter is calculated by weber fechner law to determine the assessment standard of groundwater vulnerability third according to the assessment standard probabilistic neural network is used to classify for getting the vulnerability of confined water finally the nitrate concentration is used to verify vulnerability classification the reliability of w f pnn method is analyzed 2 methods 2 1 vulnerability assessment parameters of confined water d3a2c2 the assessment parameters of confined water vulnerability are determined from the influencing factors of supply runoff and discharge of confined water the water level of phreatic water and confined water influence the complementary relationship between them the buried depth of aquifer determines the migration path length of pollutants they can be considered as d of drastic the thickness of aquifer affects its water storage capacity and self purification ability the hydraulic conductivity affects the migration velocity of pollutants the hydraulic conductivity of aquifer in different media is different so the thickness of aquifer and hydraulic conductivity can be used as indications of the media type of aquifer a of drastic in case of waterhead difference the aquitard may be a channel of the hydraulic exchange for phreatic water and confined water which can be regarded as s of drastic however since no data of the aquitard has been collected in this paper this influencing factor can only be abandoned confined water is less influenced by precipitation vadose zone and topography therefore the r i t of drastic are not selected for confined water considering the above reasons and the data can be obtained the vulnerability assessment parameters of confined water are determined as follows depth of phreatic water level depth of confined water level depth of confined aquifer thickness of phreatic aquifer thickness of confined aquifer hydraulic conductivity of phreatic aquifer and hydraulic conductivity of confined aquifer namely d3a2c2 the relationship between the assessment parameters and the vulnerability of confined water is analyzed as follows depth of phreatic water level it determines the migration path length of pollutants to the phreatic aquifer and the time of contact with surrounding vadose zone media as well as the possibility of pollutants contacting with oxygen in soil pore resulting in oxidation therefore the deeper the phreatic water level is the longer time the pollutants reach the phreatic aquifer and the more they are absorbed and degraded the less likely the phreatic aquifer is to be contaminated depth of confined water level refers to the vertical distance between the confined water level and the surface equal to the surface elevation minus the confined water level which can be positive or negative generally positive the greater the buried depth of the confined water level the farther away from the surface the less likely the confined water is to be polluted and the lower the vulnerability depth of confined aquifer refers to the vertical distance between the top of the confined aquifer and the surface equal to the surface elevation minus the top elevation of the confined aquifer the buried depth determines the migration path of pollutants to the aquifer and the possibility of pollutants contacting with oxygen in soil pore resulting in oxidation therefore the greater the buried depth the longer time of pollutants reach to the aquifer the more pollutants are absorbed and degraded the less possibility of confined water to be polluted and the lower the vulnerability thickness of phreatic aquifer the greater the thickness of phreatic aquifer the smaller the relative range of pollution the greater the amount of pollutants absorbed or degraded and the lower the vulnerability of phreatic water so the lower the vulnerability of confined water thickness of confined aquifer the greater the thickness of confined aquifer the smaller the relative range of pollution the greater the amount of pollutants adsorbed or degraded and the lower the vulnerability of confined water hydraulic conductivity of phreatic aquifer the smaller the hydraulic conductivity of phreatic aquifer the smaller the migration velocity of pollutants in the aquifer the smaller the pollution diffusion range the less the possibility of pollution and the lower the polluted possibility of confined aquifer hydraulic conductivity of confined aquifer the smaller the hydraulic conductivity of confined aquifer the smaller the migration velocity of pollutants in the aquifer the smaller the pollution diffusion range and the lower the vulnerability of confined water 2 2 application of the weber fechner law in vulnerability assessment of confined water 2 2 1 the weber fechner w f law psychophysics is a subdiscipline of experimental psychology that describes the psychological response of people to variation of a physical stimulus montello 2002 w f law is the basis of psychophysics and describes the relationship between physical magnitudes of stimuli and the perceived intensity of the stimuli in recent years w f law is successfully applied in the formulation of ambient air quality standards li and peng 2003 residential indoor environment quality evaluation wei et al 2016 the sensitivity of the odour perception of the individual substances wu et al 2016 odor impact criteria huang and guo 2018 sensory sweetness definition for sugars mao et al 2019 etc however the application of w f law in the field of groundwater is relatively rare especially in the vulnerability of confined water bojórquez tapia et al 2009 based the categorization of groundwater vulnerability on the w f law with the use of w f law and fuzzy pattern recognition could produce results that are congruent with peoples ability to receive process and remember information 1834 weber formulated a law that established that for the just noticeable difference a given intensity of stimulation was proportional to the original stimulus lanzara 1994 remarkably similar results were discovered for sound light smell and taste stimuli then the ratio 1 r jnd s where r is a constant jnd is the just noticeable difference for discrimination s is the magnitude of a stimulus but fechner founded that when the dose of a chemical drug or hormone is administered the response is not linearly related to the dose rather it is the logarithm of the dose versus the response that most nearly describes the dose response relationship lanzara 1994 so fechner joint acceptance of weber s law plus the assumption that all jnd s have equal subjective size leads to a simple logarithmic rule relating the level of sensation to the stimuli 2 jnd a log s b where a and b are constants eq 2 is the w f law derivative of s on both sides of the formula then 3 djnd ds a ln 10 s multiply ds on both sides 4 djnd a ln 10 s d s so while s increases following a geometric series jnd varies as an arithmetic series 2 2 2 w f law and confined water d3a2c2 in this paper the value of vulnerability parameter can be regarded as the magnitude of a stimulus s the vulnerability categories can be regarded as the just noticeable difference for discrimination namely jnd the relationship between the vulnerability parameters and vulnerability categories accord with w f law when the magnitude of a stimulus s the value of vulnerability parameter changes in equal ratio sequence jnd vulnerability category changes in equal difference the general formula of the series of equal ratio numbers is 5 s n s 0 q n where s n is the magnitude of a stimulus the value of a vulnerability assessment parameter of confined water s 0 is the minimum magnitude of a stimulus the minimum value of a certain confined water vulnerability assessment parameter value q is the common ratio of the equal ratio series namely the common ratio of the magnitude of a stimulus n is the confined water vulnerability category which changes in the sequence of equal difference it can be seen that when s changes in equal ratio n changes in equal difference which conforms to w f law similar statements appear in bojórquez tapia s article eqs 13 and 14 in bojórquez tapia s article are s h s 1 r s h 1 s h s 1 r h s 0 from the above two formulas 6 s h 1 s 0 1 r h 1 where h is groundwater vulnerability categories r is a constant the initial stimulus s0 represents the absolute threshold or the smallest detectable level of a stimulus bojórquez tapia et al 2009 it can be seen that eqs 5 and 6 have similar forms for a specific proportional sequence q is a constant and 1 r is a constant therefore eq 5 conforms to w f law eq 5 can be used to express the relationship between the vulnerability assessment parameter value of confined water and the vulnerability category if vulnerability is divided into four categories then n 0 1 2 4 from eq 5 it can be seen that q i s in s i 0 1 n s i max s i min 1 n max s i 4 s i 0 1 4 where q i is the common ratio of a confined water vulnerability parameter i s i max is the maximum value of a confined water vulnerability parameter s i max s i 4 s i 0 is the minimum value of a confined water vulnerability parameter s i min s i 0 0 s i 0 s i 1 s i 2 s i 3 s i 4 are the center value of vulnerability category of a parameter that is the cluster center of probabilistic neural network pnn corresponding to different classification categories from the most unfavorable point of view make the following assumptions for the parameter with the smaller value and the lower vulnerability s i 1 s i 2 s i 3 s i 4 were selected as the cluster center of l m h vh i ii iii iv such parameters include hydraulic conductivity of phreatic aquifer and hydraulic conductivity of confined aquifer for the parameter with the higher value and the lower vulnerability s i 3 s i 2 s i 1 s i 0 were selected as the cluster center of l m h vh i ii iii iv such parameters include depth of phreatic water level thickness of phreatic aquifer depth of confined aquifer thickness of confined aquifer and depth of confined water level different classification numbers correspond to different n if it is divided into five categories then n max 5 according to the w f law n 0 1 5 and then according to the formula q i s i max s i min 1 n max s i 5 s i 0 1 5 which can determine the center value of each category of vulnerability parameter it can be seen that after the vulnerability parameter is selected the assessment standard can be determined by w f law according to the maximum and minimum value of the assessment parameter in the study area the shortcoming of this method is that more original data are needed to get the maximum and minimum values but there are many assessment sub regions in groundwater vulnerability assessment which can overcome this shortcoming and meet the requirements of w f law so w f law can be applied to the vulnerability assessment of confined water 2 3 probabilistic neural network probabilistic neural network pnn is proposed by specht d f in 1989 based on the radial basis network the density function estimation and bayesian decision theory are integrated under some conditions that are easy to meet the decision boundary realized by pnn gradually approaches the bayesian best decision surface pnn has successfully solved all kinds of engineering problems in various fields since it is proposed yi et al 2016 it is also applied in the field of water quality classification dong et al 2009 chen et al 2004 but its application for classification problem in groundwater vulnerability assessment is rare back propagation bp neural network method was used to evaluate groundwater vulnerability by dixon 2001 but bp network is not as suitable as pnn in classification pnn is composed of input layer sample layer summation layer and competition layer su and song 2011 the first layer is the input layer and the number of neurons is the dimension of eigenvector the euclidean distance is calculated between the input vector and all the training samples to be identified the second layer is the sample layer the number of neurons is the number of training samples to be identified the activation function of sample layer is gaussian function the third layer is the summation layer and the number of neurons is the number of categories the output of the sample layer is added by grade if the output of the sample layer is divided into 4 grades it is equivalent to 4 adders the last layer is the competition layer and the number of neurons is 1 the result of the decision is output by the competition layer the output of the grade with the highest probability is 1 and the other results are 0 the newpnn function provided by matlab can be used to design pnn conveniently the statement to establish the network is net newpnn p t spread p is the input vector t is the output vector spread is the distribution density of radial basis function in the pnn spread has a great influence on its performance if it is improperly selected the pnn will produce bad prediction results it is difficult to select the optimal manually yi et al 2016 for better analysis of the influence of spread on network performance the spread value is trained and the best one is selected from 0 1 2 3 1 pnn and confined water vulnerability the core of building pnn is to use assessment standard to determine the input vector which is directly used for pattern classification the assessment parameter data unknown mode is used as the training samples namely the cluster centers of each parameter calculated by w f law are used as the input vector and the parameter data of each regions in the study area are used as the training samples after calculating by pnn the one with output 1 corresponds to the vulnerability category of the region in this paper w f law and pnn are combined to propose a w f pnn method for vulnerability assessment of confined water 2 3 2 normalization to prevent variables with large numerical ranges dominating those with smaller numerical ranges in the models and also to speed up the model training process and convergence during training the input variables should be scaled prior to model calibration barzegar et al 2019b assessment standard and the parameter data of each regions were scaled using the maximum and minimum values of the parameter data in the study area furthermore as the accuracy of neural network training and prediction of 0 1 data is high it is necessary to normalize the input data the deviation standardization method is used to make linear transformation of the original data so the result value is mapped between 0 1 the conversion function is as follows 7 r ij x ij min 1 i n x ij max 1 i n x ij min 1 i n x ij where x ij is the original data of row i column j max 1 i n x ij is the maximum value of column j min 1 i n x ij is the minimum value of column j r ij is the data of row i and column j after normalization i 1 2 n j 1 2 m 3 case study 3 1 division of study area xi an is bounded by 107 40 109 49 e and 33 42 34 45 n it is about 204 km from the east to the west and 116 km from the south to the north it is the most open area of wei river valley the total land area of the city is 9983 km2 of which the plain area is 4481 km2 xi an has a clear boundary of geomorphic from south to north qinling mountains loess hills loess tableland alluvial fan plain wei river and tributary terrace alluvial plain according to the administrative divisions and geomorphic characteristics the plain area of xi an can be divided into 30 sub regions table 1 and fig 1 show the division the shallow confined water with a buried depth of 300 m in plain area of xi an city is taken as the research object the formation lithology is mainly composed of gravel sand silt silty clay and loess li et al 2002 it is mainly supplied by leakage recharge from overlaying phreatic water department of geology and mineral resources of shaanxi province 1999 the confined water is distributed under the phreatic water bearing formation of each geomorphic unit in the plain area which is composed of quaternary middle and lower pleistocene lacustrine proluvial alluvial gravel and pebble medium coarse and fine sand and sandy loam in the front of the mountain it is mainly proluvial in the loess tableland it is mainly proluvial in the first and second terrace of wei river it is mainly lacustrine the lithology has a certain change rule in the horizontal direction in the near piedmont area the particles are coarse thick and muddy the grain size between the fans and the leading edge becomes smaller the layer decreases and the thickness becomes thinner 3 2 application of w f pnn method 3 2 1 data table 1 shows the division of xi an city in geomorphology there is a well in each sub region as a representative point in this region 30 confined water wells are collected the data of water level and buried depth are from the environmental monitoring station of shaanxi province and the dynamic report of groundwater in 2005 jiao et al 2006 the data of the hydraulic conductivity and the thickness of the confined aquifer are from the groundwater resources exploration report of xi an area no 1 hydrogeological engineering geological team bureau of geology and mineral exploration and development of shaanxi province 1988 3 2 2 determination of vulnerability assessment standard for confined water based on the results of bojórquez tapia et al 2009 the vulnerability of groundwater is divided into four categories they are named l low m moderate h high and vh very high with corresponding grades of l ⅰ m ii h iii vh iv according to the discussion in 2 2 2 w f law and confined water d3a2c2 the assessment standard of confined water vulnerability is determined namely the cluster center of each parameter was calculated and the results are shown in table 2 q i is the common ratio of the confined water parameter i take the first vulnerability parameter the depth of phreatic water level as an example q 1 s in s i 0 1 n s 1 max s 1 min 1 4 s 14 s

are calculated in turn as mentioned in 2 2 2 from the most unfavorable point of view for the parameter with the smaller value and the lower vulnerability s i 1 s i 2 s i 3 s i 4 are selected as the cluster center for l m h vh i ii iii iv for the parameter with the higher value and the lower vulnerability s i 3 s i 2 s i 1 s i 0 are selected as the cluster center of l m h vh i ii iii iv among the seven parameters in d3a2c2 for the parameter with the smaller value and the lower vulnerability there are two parameters hydraulic conductivity of phreatic aquifer and hydraulic conductivity of confined aquifer for the parameter with higher value and lower vulnerability there are five parameters depth of phreatic water level thickness of phreatic aquifer depth of confined aquifer thickness of confined aquifer and depth of confined water level according to this principle the cluster center and assessment standard of confined water vulnerability are listed in table 3 there are four cluster centers corresponding to each parameter for example depth of phreatic water level the cluster centers of l low m moderate h high vh very high are 32 5 m 12 8 m 5 1 m and 2 0 m 3 2 3 construction and application of pnn 1 determination and normalization of input vector p the vulnerability assessment standard of confined water is the input vector p which is the data in table 3 eq 7

vulnerability assessment of confined water the number of neurons in the summation layer i e the vulnerability category 4 the training sample vector to be identified in the sample layer also needs to be normalized the euclidean distance between the input vector p and all the training sample vectors to be identified is calculated in the input layer 2 determination of output vector of network target t the output vector of the competition layer is represented by t if it is divided into four categories then t is a unit matrix with 4 4 row vector in t respectively corresponds to the response state of evaluation grade i ii iii and iv in the network output layer for the groundwater vulnerability assessment t 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 the competition layer takes the largest one in the summation layer as the output category its output is 1 and the output of other neurons is 0 if the output of the second row of the t matrix is 1 for a certain sub region then this sub region of the study area belongs to the confined water vulnerability category ii namely m moderate 3 application of pnn all parameter values of 30 sub regions are normalized compared with the assessment standard p and the euclidean distance is calculated to classify the vulnerability the output result of pnn is the vulnerability assessment result of 30 sub regions table 4 and fig 1 are the vulnerability assessment results of confined water in plain area of xi an in 2005 the vulnerability is classified into four categories i e low moderate high and very high vulnerability based on w f law as suggested by bojórquez tapia et al 2009 4 results and discussion 4 1 statistical analysis of parameters the statistical analysis of confined water vulnerability parameters is helpful for acknowledging the law of variation of hydrogeological parameters table 5 shows the minimum maximum mean standard deviation sd and coefficient of variation cv for each parameter results show that the standard deviation of hydraulic conductivity of confined aquifer is the smallest with value of 9 91 m d indicates data aggregation the standard deviation of depth of confined water level is the largest with value of 42 12 m indicates data dispersion thickness and hydraulic conductivity of confined aquifer are less than phreatic aquifer thickness with average values of 25 5 m and 85 m hydraulic conductivity with average values of 18 m d and 45 m d respectively additionally spatial variations of depth of phreatic water level depth of confined water level thickness of confined aquifer and hydraulic conductivity of confined aquifer are large which can be identified by cv higher than 50 4 2 the vulnerability of the confined water fig 1 shows that the vulnerability of the confined water in the plain area of xi an city gradually reduces from the flood plain the first terrace the second terrace the third terrace the alluvial fan to the loess tableland and the confined water quality is more and more difficult to be polluted loess tableland areas were mostly low vulnerability regions second and third terrace or proluvial fan were mostly moderate vulnerability regions first and second terrace were mostly high vulnerability regions the flood plain of wei river were mostly very high vulnerability regions the characteristics of each sub region are as follows there are seven low vulnerability regions most of which were distributed in loess tableland areas the sub region number 5 no 5 is the water source of ba river the buried depth of phreatic water at the representative point is relatively deep 34 27 m the thickness of confined aquifer is 130 m the hydraulic conductivity of confined aquifer is 12 m d most of the parameter data are close to the cluster center with low vulnerability and the possibility of aquifer pollution is small no 9 13 17 18 21 and 25 are loess tableland areas which are located in shenhe tableland shaoling tableland bailuyuan of lantian county lanmei tableland of zhouzhi county and ma e tableland of lintong district the hydraulic conductivity of phreatic aquifer is small the buried depth of the roof of confined aquifer is greater than 100 m the buried depth of phreatic water and confined water level is large the possibility of the confined aquifer being polluted is small there are few restrictions on pollutant discharge in low vulnerability regions but it is not allowed to discharge blindly there are eight moderate vulnerability regions most of which are distributed in first second and third terrace or proluvial fan no 24 and 29 of the regions are proluvial fan which are located in zhouzhi country and huyi district respectively the buried depth of phreatic water level is about 30 m the buried depth of the roof of confined aquifer is about 35 40 m and the thickness of confined aquifer is 40 50 m no 3 4 12 15 and 20 are second and third terrace which are located in chang an district city six district and lantian county the hydraulic conductivity of confined aquifer is similar which is 7 9 m d and the thickness of confined aquifer is about 30 40 m among them no 3 and 12 are located in second terrace and each parameter value is near the standard value of moderate vulnerability no 15 is located in second and third terrace and the buried depth of phreatic water level is about 20 m and the buried depth of confined water level is about 16 m although the buried depth of water level is shallow but the hydraulic conductivity of phreatic aquifer is smaller about 11 m d so the vulnerability is moderate no 20 is located in the third terrace the buried depth of phreatic water level is shallow 20 m but the buried depth of the roof of confined aquifer is 95 m so the vulnerability is moderate no 4 is located in the southern suburb of xi an city although the buried depth of phreatic water level is shallow but because of the excessive exploitation of the confined water in the suburb for many years the water level of confined water at this point drops to 130 m although no 4 is located in the third terrace the water supply condition of the confined water is better than that of the loess tableland however due to the large amount of groundwater exploitation the buried depth of confined water level in 2005 is large and the pollutant migration path is long no 4 belongs to the moderate vulnerable area no 8 is located in the first terrace with the buried depth of phreatic water level of 18 24 m the buried depth of the roof of confined aquifer of 70 m the thickness of confined aquifer of 60 m and the buried depth of confined water level of 106 m it can be seen that the buried depth of confined water level is relatively large and the thickness of the aquifer is moderate which is a moderate vulnerable area therefore the discharge of pollutants in this area should be limited there are eleven high vulnerability regions with no 2 7 10 11 14 16 19 23 27 28 and 30 which distributed in all administrative regions most of them are located in flood plain and first and second terrace the buried depth of phreatic water and confined water level is shallow the hydraulic conductivity of aquifer is large the hydraulic conductivity of phreatic aquifer is about 25 35 m d that of confined aquifer is 10 25 m d and the buried depth of confined aquifer roof is 40 90 m no 16 is a alluvial fan which is located in the front of the loess tableland in chang an district although the hydraulic conductivity of phreatic aquifer is small about 10 m d but the buried depth of phreatic water and confined water level are shallow and the buried depth of the roof of confined aquifer is about 40 m so no 16 belongs to the high vulnerability area the high vulnerability area should be protected and the pollutant discharge should be strictly controlled there are four very high vulnerability regions all of which are located in the flood plain no 1 6 22 and 26 which are respectively located in city six district feng and zao river water source area zhouzhi county and huyi district in these areas the phreatic water and confined water supply conditions are good the phreatic water buried depth is shallow and the hydraulic conductivities of phreatic water and confined aquifer are large over 30 m d most of the groundwater exploitation is near the river the cycle of groundwater recharge and discharge is fast which is the most likely to cause pollutant diffusion it belongs to the area with very high vulnerability therefore a protection zone should be established to prohibit the discharge of pollutants in very high vulnerability regions 4 3 verification the vulnerability assessment of groundwater in this paper is based on the following assumptions the pollutant discharge in each region is the same due to the difference of pollutant discharge in different regions in reality and the vulnerability of confined water has not been studied in xi an before it is difficult to verify refer to other articles the vulnerability assessment results of confined water were verified by nitrate concentration over the area in this paper as the confined water in the study area is mainly supplied by phreatic water and the lack of nitrate concentration data of confined water the nitrate concentration in phreatic water were used to verify the confined water vulnerability the nitrate concentrations of 18 phreatic wells in xi an were measured from october to december 2016 meng et al 2018 and marked in fig 1 the data is from the national infrastructure project national groundwater monitoring project fig 2 shows the correlation between vulnerability of confined water for sub regions and nitrate concentration by comparing the nitrate concentration in 2016 meng et al 2018 with the confined water vulnerability in 2005 fig 1 and fig 2 it can be seen that in low vulnerability regions the nitrate concentration was less than 5 mg l no 18 however the nitrate concentration in no 13 is 7 95 mg l no 13 belongs to lintong district in 2005 the ammonia nitrogen concentration of the river water in this region was 2 75 mg l total nitrogen concentration was 10 20 mg l lang et al 2009 therefore groundwater in this region has a higher nitrate concentration than 5 mg l which was attributed to the river water infiltration in the moderate vulnerability regions the nitrate concentrations ranged between 3 76 and 5 23 mg l less than 10 mg l in high vulnerability regions the nitrate concentration of four regions were greater than 10 mg l two of them were greater than 20 mg l the nitrate concentration in no 7 was 0 11 0 22 mg l as no 7 was weibin water source the very high vulnerability regions were mostly located in the flood plain the nitrate concentration was less than 10 mg l for example no 1 close to moderate vulnerability region no 2 if protection measures are not adopted the nitrate concentration in this area is easier to increase than other regions according to the nitrate concentration meng et al 2018 the nitrate concentration in most wells of chang an district is less than 5 mg l in zhouzhi country huyi district is less than or equal to 5 mg l in city six district is 0 11 5 39 mg l in yanliang district is 14 53 mg l in lintong district is 3 68 23 87 mg l in gaoling district is 23 64 mg l in the standard for groundwater quality gb t 14848 2017 general administration of quality supervision 2017 the nitrate concentration is 20 mg l for iii grade and beyond this range it is harmful lintong district and gaoling district locate in the north of wei river the nitrate concentration exceeds 20 mg l for iii grade of the standard for groundwater quality gb t 14848 2017 these regions just right belong to the high vulnerability region so there are some correlations between vulnerability and nitrate concentration the distribution of high vulnerability region is mostly consistent with that of high nitrate concentration region except some protected regions such as water source or serious pollution of river water the nitrate concentration after 11 years can verify the rationality of the vulnerability assessment results of confined water in 2005 therefore the results of vulnerability assessment of confined water in 2005 is reasonable 5 conclusions considering water quantity and quality the groundwater vulnerability could be divided into water quantity vulnerability and water quality vulnerability the water quality vulnerability of confined water was studied in this paper according to the influencing factors of confined water d3a2c2 were determined which included seven parameters for vulnerability assessment of confined water a new method w f pnn method was proposed for groundwater vulnerability assessment from the perspective of people s easy recognition and memory the number of categories was 4 w f law was used to calculate the cluster center based on the minimum and maximum values of parameters in the study area then the assessment standard was determined people s feelings of external influence was quantified avoiding subjectivity and assigning rates for parameters pnn can avoid subjectivity caused by assigning weight in the classification process and was used to classify confined water vulnerability by calculating the distance between cluster center and data of the study area w f law and pnn were well combined in this paper and was called w f pnn method to assess the vulnerability of confined water in the plain area of xi an in 2005 the confined water vulnerability was divided into four categories which was easy for decision makers to make decisions there are seven low vulnerability regions eight moderate vulnerability regions eleven high vulnerability regions and four very high vulnerability regions for confined water in the plain area of xi an in 2005 the vulnerability of the confined water gradually reduced from the flood plain the first terrace the second terrace the third terrace the alluvial fan to the loess tableland the confined water vulnerability in 2005 was verified by nitrate concentration in 2016 the results showed that except for groundwater source the higher the vulnerability was the higher the concentration of nitrate was the distribution of high vulnerability region was mostly consistent with that of high nitrate concentration region so the assessment results of w f pnn method were reasonable w f pnn method can also be used to evaluate the vulnerability of phreatic water not only the vulnerability of confined water the parameters just need to be replaced by the parameters related to phreatic water the other steps are the same as those for confined water in addition due to insufficient data the data of each representative point were taken as the data of this sub region but the evaluation result basically conforms to the nitrate concentration which shows that w f pnn method is reliable in a word w f pnn method can avoid subjectivity in the process of groundwater vulnerability assessment and is suitable for the area with insufficient data credit authorship contribution statement yanhui dong writing original draft writing review editing weibo zhou writing
