6540,determining the characteristics of pipe flow and the effect of friction resistance is relevant to a variety of applications in hydraulic and hydrological engineering such as flood control river restoration and ground runoff prediction in the nikuradse s experiments the relative roughness and the bulk reynolds number are used to scale the darcy friction factor thereby determining the mean velocity recent observations using permeable walled pipes however indicate that the friction factor can significantly deviate from the results obtained in nikuradse s approach here we propose a concise model to estimate the mean velocity of the pipe flow over permeable walls the model is formulated using a data driven approach based on the analytical solution of the mean velocity and the similarity analysis dimension conservation of the two extreme cases impermeable and porous pipe flow we show that the proposed approach can derive a physically meaningful formula for the mean velocity furthermore we propose a simple momentum transfer model which confirms the findings from the data driven approach the momentum transfer model indicates that the friction factor can be scaled with two different relative hydraulics radius scales which are intrinsically determined by two different eddy sizes lastly the present approach is examined by comparing it with another approximate formula and the limited experimental data in the literature keywords mean flow velocity turbulent flow permeable boundary data driven approach momentum transfer 1 introduction over the decades the nikuradse 1950 diagram has been a key reference to address the intricate interplay among friction resistance reynolds number and pipe roughness over a non permeable boundary for example the blasius and stickler laws goldenfeld 2006 coupled with the nikuradse diagram provide two fundamental ways to explore the friction factor for hydraulically smooth and rough pipe flows traditional theories generally relate the friction factor to different flow regimes depending on the reynolds number and the relative roughness height in recent years goldenfeld 2006 used a critical temperature model to explore turbulent friction factor and combined the six nikuradse curves into a monotonic one subsequently tao 2009 improved the monotonic model and an explicit formula for the monotonic curve was given by li et al 2015a and li and huai 2016 still since pressure driven pipe systems are widely used for a variety of civil and domestic purposes analysis of the long term usage of pipes requires accounting for the case of a permeable boundary panday and huyakorn 2004 fontan et al 2013 manes et al 2011 2012 the sedimentation of particles inside a pipe acts as a layer of porous media on the surface of the pipe itself the flow structure and flow regimes are affected by the presence of a porous sedimentation layer although not investigated in this study the sedimentation layer provides an ideal environment for the growth of biofilm which greatly influences the hydraulic conductivity thereby impacting the chemical and microbiological processes inside the pipe kapellos et al 2007 peszynska et al 2016 economically the increased friction resistance generated by the obstruction of particles on the wall consumes more energy to run the pipe system which is a major concern with significant economic implications understanding the physical properties of the flow over a permeable boundary is a necessary first step before biochemical transport processes inside the pipe can be fully investigated to investigate the permeable case cheng et al 2016 conducted experiments using pvc pipes with multiple layers of grains beads to simulate pipe flow over a permeable wall the experimental configurations have been described in detail elsewhere therefore only the key information is included here fig 1 shows the experimental conditions for increasing the number of grain layers inside the pipe the grains with a mean diameter of d are uniformly attached in a smooth pipe of diameter d to mimic the permeable boundary the number of layers in each pipe is notated with n the results of the permeable pipe experiments from cheng et al 2016 are presented in fig 2 where the friction factor from the original nikuradse diagram is also included fig 2 shows that the friction resistance is much larger due to the effect of large scale grains this implies that the relative roughness height ε d where ε is the representative height of the small scale roughness elements is not sufficient to explain the friction factor furthermore the influence of the reynolds number on the friction factor is less significant compared to the relative length scale this implies that the aforementioned formulae such as the blasius and stickler laws originally derived for impermeable pipes are insufficient to address the permeable pipe flow case therefore deriving a formula to describe the flow over a permeable boundary is necessary to improve our understanding of the mechanisms that govern the characteristics of the flow discharge and the friction resistance for the permeable flow case as a first step this work aims to derive a physically meaningful and concise formula to predict the flow velocity inside a permeable walled pipe to ensure the formula is physically meaningful we will use a combination of analytical and data driven approaches we assume that the analytical solutions from two extreme cases the porous pipe flow and the darcy s flow can be used to derive the formula for the bulk mean velocity of permeable walled pipes based on the similarity principle a hybrid genetic programming algorithm gp will be employed to search for the possible solutions of mean velocity without presuming any predetermined form of the solution to explain the physics we will propose a phenomenological momentum transfer model finally the results will also be compared with the limited data available in the literature 2 materials and methods 2 1 two layer model and two extreme cases a cylindrical coordinate system of the pipe flow over a permeable walled pipe is sketched in fig 3 where r is the radius at any position θ is the cylindrical angle x is the longitudinal direction and u is the local velocity consider the steady incompressible newtonian fluid over a permeable walled pipe in a cylindrical coordinate system with r axis and longitudinal x axis aligned in the flow direction the axial naiver stokes equation can be simplified as follows 1 ρ u t u r u r u θ r u θ u u x p x ρ g x μ 1 r r r u r 1 r 2 2 u θ 2 2 u x 2 d x where u is the local velocity p is the water pressure μ is the dynamic viscosity ρ is density of the fluid g x is a component of gravitational acceleration in the x streamwise direction and d x is the total drag force generated by friction if we express the parameters in eq 1 as the sum of the mean and the local fluctuating components e g u u u where u is the ensemble mean and u is the local fluctuation then eq 1 originally from the laminar case can lead to the prognostic equations for both the mean and the fluctuating parts and thus can be extended to turbulent flow in open channel flows many models have been developed to analytically solve the navier stokes equation for example katul et al 2004 derived an amended k ε model to scale the flow regimes in a model of canopy flow here rather than attempting to directly solve eq 1 we focus on simplifying it and deriving two analytical equations for two extreme cases we then use the results as the first step to derive the mean velocity of the permeable walled pipe flow the permeable walled pipe is divided into two different layers namely the basal permeable layer and the inner water layer layer ii and i in fig 4 respectively the basal permeable layer starts from the boundary of the pipe to the top of innermost grains the remaining pipe cross section is called the inner water layer we use the term bulk pipe to refer to the entire pipe system including the basal permeable bed and the inner water layers the two extreme cases for the pipe flow over the permeable wall are called case i classic pipe flow and case ii porous pipe flow respectively as shown in fig 4 in a permeable pipe system the flow in the basal permeable layer layer ii is similar to the flow in case ii porous pipe flow which can be described as a darcy flow while layer i inner water layer is analogous to case i classic pipe flow the assumption of darcy flow is valid since the flow inside layer ii is strongly obstructed by the grains where the velocity is much smaller compared with flow in the inner water layer moreover since the grains are homogeneously distributed we assume that the velocity is uniformly distributed in layer ii with the assumption that the thickness of layer ii is higher than that of the viscous layer yang et al 2015 for the flow in the inner layer the surface of the attached grains forms a rough bed we thus consider that as a classic rough pipe flow problem therefore the basic hypothesis is that cases i classic pipe flow and ii porous pipe flow can reflect the hydraulic properties of layers i inner water layer and ii basal permeable layer of the permeable walled pipe for the two extreme conditions under case i the classic pipe flow case no grain is attached inside the pipe the mean velocity of the pipe flow in the turbulent regime under the darcy weisbach equation clark 2011 cheng et al 2016 can be given as 2 u 2 2 u 2 f where u is the mean velocity of the bulk flow u is the shear velocity defined as gd s a s a is the head loss per unit length due to pressure and gravity ergun 1952 and f is the global friction factor of the pipe the nikuradse chart shows that the friction factor f r e d is a function of the reynolds number and the relative roughness given that the reynolds number is a function of the mean velocity u the dimensionless velocity u u is expected to be determined by the length scale bed roughness and diameter d of the pipe for case ii the drag force caused by the grains for the bulk flow is approximated as 3 d x 1 2 c d a n ρ u 2 where c d is the drag coefficient of the grain because the drag only acts on the fluid within the grains which occupies a fraction of porosity n thus the total drag is divided by the porosity a a f c v is the frontal grain area per unit volume a f is the frontal area of the wetted grain cv is the control volume of the fluid and u again is the mean velocity of the flow inside the grains the pressure gradient p x and the stream wise gravitation ρ g x in a tilted pipe can be combined into one term ρ g s a where s a is the effective slope cheng et al 2016 assume that a pipe is sufficiently long in a steady state t 0 and that the flow has no swirl θ 0 so that the integration of eq 1 along r for the full grain case at any position 0 2 r d yields the following 4 r d 2 c d a 2 n ρ u 2 d r μ r d 2 1 r r r u r d r ρ g s a d 2 r most of the spatial domain is occupied by the grains in layer ii so that the permeable grain drag is more important than the surface friction on the wall of the pipe this implies that the second term on the left hand side of eq 4 is negligible therefore eq 4 can be simplified into 5 u 2 2 n g d s a c d a 2 n u 2 c d a eq 5 shows that the friction factor f can be expressed as c d a n for the basal permeable layer in the following we assume c d is a constant an assumption only valid for high reynolds numbers as given in both cases i and ii u u can be scaled by a group of morphological parameters d n n number of grain layers in the pipe and a noted that a is determined by d and d we hypothesize that the dimensionless dynamical parameter group u u for the bulk pipe flow would be scaled by another group of dimensionless morphological parameters n d d since the bed roughness height is far less than the roughness due to the grain size d the morphological parameter group thus can be simplified by using n d d in the following we aim to derive suitable equations for expressing the morphological parameters and find the explicit relationship between u u and n d d to predict the bulk mean velocity 2 2 representative length scale and phenomenological momentum transfer model for the bulk permeable walled pipe flow the five parameters corresponding to the dynamics in the system include the density ρ bulk velocity u shear velocity u pipe diameter d and grain diameter d according to buckingham s π theorem clark 2011 a functional relationship exists i e f ρ u u d d 0 where f denotes a certain unknown function furthermore since the three physical dimensions involved in this system are mass length and time the number of independent dimensionless parameter groups is two 5 3 or equivalently f 1 π 1 π 2 0 where π i is the i th dimensionless group the first dimensionless parameter group is the relative velocity scale that is π 1 u u the other group is the relative length scale which can be interpreted as the ratio of height or area the volume is not considered here due to the homogenous experimental configurations in x direction since there are three length scales the grain and pipe diameters and the height of inner water layer the total combinations of the dimensionless length scales in terms of height and area is therefore 6 c 2 1 c 4 1 the relative length scales can thus be reasonably determined by the ratio of the total height of grains d b to pipe diameter d b d 2 n d d the ratio of the total height of inner water layer h w to pipe diameter h w d 1 2 n d d the ratio of the area of flow in inner water layer to total flow area in the pipe a p a d 2 n d 2 d 2 the ratio of the area of the flow inside the grain layer to total flow area in the pipe a a a n 1 d 2 n d 2 d 2 the ratio of the area of obstruction to the flow area in the grain layer a o a 1 n 1 d 2 n d 2 d 2 and the ratio of the area of the total flow in the pipe to the total pipe area a v a n 1 n d 2 n d 2 d 2 therefore the second dimensionless group is derived as π 2 f 2 d b d h w d a p a a a a a o a a v a where f 2 is a function to be explicitly validated using experimental data the relative area scale can also be understood from the perspective of volumetric hydraulic radius identical to the definition of hydraulic radius cross section area over a wetted perimeter here we extend this concept to a three dimensional case as the total flow volume over a wetted surface for the small scale roughness element the surface area of the grains is much smaller compared with the perimeter so the perimeter is usually used for the hydraulics radius calculation for example considering a grain with a radius of r the ratio of surface area to perimeter is given as π r 2 2 π r r 2 it is evident that as r increases the surface area is more and more important compared with the perimeter this exemplifies the necessity of using the area ratio for flow over large scale roughness scenarios therefore a similar volumetric hydraulic radius can be proposed as the total volume of the control system cv versus the wetted area as a result three newly defined volumetric hydraulic radius correspondingly are given as r p cv a p r a c v a a r v c v a v it is easy to see that r p reflects the wetted frontal surface area of the inner water layer while r v is the description of the total wetted frontal area in a permeable pipe the next step is to solve the first dimensionless group as a function of the second group namely solving the equation π 1 π 2 3 data driven approach 3 1 data cluster to approximate the equation π 1 π 2 we use the data reported from cheng et al 2016 in nikuradse s pipe flow experiment turbulence occurs when the reynolds number is approximately 2300 for the case of an emergent canopy flow which is similar to the present permeable pipe experiments nepf 1999 nikora et al 2007 and liu et al 2008 have shown that the stream wise velocity in the bottom inner water layer is small as governed by darcy s law furthermore other studies from cheng 2011 huthoff et al 2007 and li et al 2015b have assumed that the flow regimes are primarily turbulent in the upper layers therefore in the present paper we select data whose reynolds number is larger than 2000 assuming π 2 is a single variable function of the aforementioned six relative length scales d b d h w d a p a a a a a o a a v a then π 1 is plotted versus each dimensionless length scale in fig 5 fig 5 shows a monotonic relationship between u and a proposed dimensional shear velocity however the different dependencies exact physical relations between dimensional shear velocity and the defined six length scales d b d h w d a p a a a a a o a a v a indicate that we need to explore more suitable expressions for the mean velocity to systematically explore the relation concealed in the function π 1 π 2 a hybrid genetic programming gp algorithm an approach initially proposed by koza 1992 and embedded in the software eureqa by schmidt and lipson 2009 2013 is employed to disclose the relation between bulk velocity and morphological parameters we use gp because it is not necessary to hypothesize a pre determined form for the model due to the intrinsic iterative search process aytek and kişi 2008 kisi et al 2012 roushangar et al 2014 shi et al 2019 in the derivation of the target model several groups of parameters that construct the model space should be defined and the functional relations should be chosen i e plus minus times divide exponent and logarithm if we choose too many operators and dimensionless parameters the model dimension will increase rapidly and it will become impenetrable in terms of physical meaning the final formulae will be selected with a principle of lower mean square error mse and higher correlation coefficient r 2 to clarify the data from cheng et al 2016 are used for the gp training and validation the data from huang et al 2013 are only used for comparison in the test section cheng s data are initially separated into training validation and testing subsets the training group is used to feed the gp algorithm and develop predictors the optimization of a certain formula stops when the performance decays on the validation subset a subset that has never been used for deriving the formula formula performance is finally evaluated on the testing subset a subset that has never been used during the previous steps 3 2 data selection to find a proper formula to scale the mean velocity the 271 sets of observed data from cheng et al 2016 are used to train the gp algorithm as well as to verify and test the proposed formula to yield a better predictor it is better to conduct data pre processing standardizing the dataset into a suitable range bowden et al 2002 kohonen 1990 solidoro et al 2007 the 271 sets of data are first standardized 6 x n x x m std x where x m is the mean value of the data x n is the normalized data and s t d x is the standard deviation the maximum dissimilarity algorithm mda recommended by camus et al 2011 is employed to select the data for the training group the purpose of the mda method is to select a subset of size m from the data bank of size n which can be considered representative of the entire data bank considering a data bank expressed as x x 1 x 2 x 3 x n and the subset defined as s s 1 s 2 s 3 s m then the selection steps are the following first decide the size of the subset s no clear rule exists but for example matter 1997 suggested to used 35 samples of the data bank while brown and martin 1997 argued that 20 of the data should be used flood and kartam 1994 indicated that more data sets used would increase the accuracy of the formulae some detailed discussion of the size selection can be refer found goldstein et al 2013 goldstein and coco 2014 and tinoco et al 2015 here 35 of the data are selected as the training in the present study the remaining data are randomly split between validation 85 and testing 15 second set an initial value of the subset as s 0 in this study the initial vector of the subset for mda is chosen as the one with the largest euclidean distance danielsson 1980 from the origin third calculate the dissimilarity based on euclidean distance if the vectors s j from the subset are composed of y y m value then the vector x i from the data bank should thus have n y instances therefore the euclidean distance between the vector x i from the data bank and the vector s j from the subset can be computed as 7 t i j x i s j 2 i 1 2 n y j 1 2 y the dissimilarity defined by the minimum euclidean distance is thus obtained as 8 t i s u b m i n x i s j 2 i 1 2 n y j 1 2 y finally select the data which has the largest t i s u b maximum dissimilarity and set the data as s y 1 the data are selected repetitively until the number m of subset s is 35 n as a result a 7 dimensional normalized data bank comprising 271 vectors is constructed this selection aims to choose the most suitable subset to represent the data bank the training data are shown in fig 6 4 result and discussion 4 1 gp results the ideal solution form should be as simple as feasible have lower mean square error mse between predicted and observed values and have larger correlation coefficient r 2 six relatively strong models suggested by gp algorithms are selected and presented in table 1 the mse and r 2 values are shown in fig 7 the optimal solution must be the points with maximum distance between the blued solid line and the black dashed line but have smaller complexity according to fig 7 when the complexity is 7 9 and 11 there is a largest distance between the mse and the r 2 lines therefore we choose the expressions with complexity 7 as optimal solutions which indicates the bulk mean velocity have the form 9 u a 1 a p a v a 2 a 2 u 4 2 determination of empirical coefficients in table 1 the coefficients are determined with the data selected to train the gp which consists of 95 sets of data now to optimized a 1 and a 2 all the 95 sets of training data fig 5 and 146 randomly selected validation data from cheng et al 2016 are used based on the least mean square errors mse method the mse for different a 1 and a 2 values are shown in fig 8 where the quantitative analysis suggests that the optimal values for a 1 and a 2 are 6 52 and 0 15 respectively using the proposed volumetric hydraulic radius and the optimized coefficients eq 9 is rearranged into the following 10 u 6 52 r 2 r p r v 0 15 u 4 3 test and comparison first to verify the proposed formula the remaining 30 data which are not used in optimizing the coefficients a 1 and a 2 are used to test the accuracy of eq 10 the testing results are displayed in fig 9 the relative error e r is computed as observation prediction observation the figure indicates that 90 points have an error lower than 6 and only one point has an error of 10 second for the flow over a permeable wall the formula is similar to the one proposed by ferguson 2007 which can only calculate the case when n 1 and was derived using data collected from an open channel with flow over permeable sediment bed 11 u a 3 d d u where a 3 is an empirical coefficient it should be noted that eq 11 only applies to the scenario where n 1 no formula however is available to predict the mean velocity for the pipe flow over the permeable wall when n is larger than one the comparison between eq 10 and eq 11 is shown in fig 10 fig 10 shows that both present eq 10 and ferguson s eq 11 can predict mean velocity for the case when n 1 since most of the relative errors are under 5 however present eq 10 is more applicable since it can also predict the cases when n is larger than one finally the five sets of data from huang et al 2013 which have not been used in previous training validating and testing process are used in fig 11 notice that the porosity is estimated from the number of the grains used since the experiments conditions of huang et al 2013 and facilities are different from cheng et al 2016 and the representative slope gradients are not reported from huang s study we thus simply keep the physical parameters in eqs 10 and 11 and optimize the coefficients using the same mse method the best coefficients for a 1 a 2 and a 3 are 6 37 0 42 and 0 27 respectively fig 11 shows that both present eq 10 and ferguson s eq 11 can predict mean velocity for the case when n 1 for data from huang et al 2013 however eq 10 is slightly better since 4 5 of the data have relative error lower than 5 and all relative errors are lower than 10 4 4 phenomenological momentum transfer model to explain eq 10 we start from the phenomenological model of the friction factor we hypothesize that two kind of vortices can be generated the large scale roughness vortex which is induced by the large grains and the small scale roughness vortex which is due to the surface roughness of the permeable pipe as described by kolmogorov clark 2011 since the small scale surface roughness is far less than the large scale grain size we only need to consider the large scale roughness in the permeable walled pipe flow for the large scale roughness we simply consider two types of vortices that are generated due to the strong and weak effects of the large scale grains naturally we assume that the weak effect vortex exists near the boundary of layer i inner water layer in fig 4 similarly the strong effect vortex can be found somewhere in layer ii basal permeable layer where the flow structure is greatly influenced by the large size grains we can understand this by considering the grains as a type of obstruction when the flow approaches the surface of the obstruction the flow structure is influencing by the surface and the geometry boundary layer property of the obstruction generally the more the flow is close to the obstruction the more strongly the flow structure is affected based on this principle we assume that boundary of layer i inner water layer in fig 4 is the critical surface where the flow is to be influenced by the grains we conjecture that a type of weak effect vortex exists in this region similarly an opposite strong effect vortex thus forms where the flow structure is strongly influenced by the grains according to the prior principle the place where the strong effect vortex forms must be somewhere between the boundary of the inner water layer and the surface of the pipe i e in the basal permeable layer the weak effect and strong effect vortices are closely related to the inner water and the basal permeable layers respectively now if we express the bulk flow with a velocity scale u and a length scale r which is the volumetric hydraulics radius then the partial flow confined by the boundary where the weak effect vortex occurs can be similarly represented by the velocity and length scales i e v p the layer mean velocity and the volumetric hydraulics radius r p respectively correspondingly the flow layer involved in the generation of strong effect vortex can be represented with the velocity and length scales v v and r v these expressions are reasonable since the velocities and the length scales for weak effect and strong effect vortices are closely associated with the inner water and the basal permeable layers respectively since for any flow layer with length scale r and velocity scale u over a unit surface area the corresponding momentum transfer rate is represented as ϕ ρ v r 2 mass velocity surface area the momentum fluxes of a unit scale per volume for the two strong and week effect flow layers can be computed as ϕ v ρ v v r v 2 and ϕ p ρ v p r p 2 these fluxes are related to large scale roughness and can be understood as the momentum transfer rate between layers since the momentum fluxes of those two strong and weak effect flow layers is not the same we simply use the geometric mean momentum flux ϕ v ϕ p to represent the momentum transfer rate between those two strong and week effect flow layers if we assume that the global momentum flux ρ v r 2 is proportional to the geometric average between the momentum fluxes of small and large scale vortex i e ϕ ϕ v ϕ p then a proportional scaling is derived as 12 v v v p u r v r p r 2 for the small scale roughness case i e in classic pipe flow and open flow in a rectangular channel gioia and bombardelli 2001 used a phenomenological approach to derive the turbulent stress τ the reynolds stress is given as τ ρ v n v t where v n and v t are fluctuating velocities normal and tangent to the wet surface respectively moreover such two fluctuating velocities are assumed to be separately scaled with the characteristic velocity associated with small roughness of size r and the mean velocity of the flow dominated by the hydraulic radius namely v n u r and v t u where u r is the small scale roughness induced velocity considering these conditions gioia and bombardelli 2001 concluded that v n v t u r u this assumption was subsequently adopted by katul et al 2002 in a two layer model to estimate the manning coefficients and the depth average velocity of submerged vegetated flow however for the case of a permeable pipe which is a large scale roughness problem such hypothesis no longer holds to derive a phenomenological model we introduce fig 12 in the case of the permeable walled pipe flow the space occupied by the large grains cannot be ignored thus the tangent fluctuating velocity v t should be closely related to the mean flow velocity of the total vacant area a v which is v v instead of u note that u q a i e v t v v further the normal fluctuating velocity is assumed to be scaled with v p the bulk mean velocity of the inner water later since v p is not equal to v v a velocity shear between the inner water layer and the porous grained layer is induced also as v p is much larger than v v the normal fluctuating velocity v n should be on the same order of v p this leads to the assumption v n v p therefore using this phenomenological model the turbulence shear stress τ ρ v n v t near the wall can be rewritten as 13 τ ρ v v v p eq 13 physically suggests that the characteristic shear stress for the permeable walled pipe flow is determined by two different mean velocity scales in the inner water and the basal permeable layers respectively now if eq 13 is divided by ρ u 2 on both the left hand and right hand sides then it leads to a scaling for the friction factor as f v v v p u 2 furthermore substituting eq 12 into such scaling yields 14 f r p r r v r 2 eq 14 shows that the friction factor in the permeable bed is determined by the relative length scales of the two large scale roughness vortices this result is in line with previous studies showing that small scale roughness vortices alone cannot be used to explain friction for the flow over permeable beds cheng et al 2016 ferguson 2007 rearranging eq 14 yields a formula to compute the mean velocity as 15 u u a 4 r 2 r p r v ε e where a 4 is a constant coefficient and ε e is the truncation error indicating any other high order terms which also contribute to the friction factor but the sum of those are negligible compared with the first term on the right hand side of the equation eq 15 is consistent with the result in eq 10 assuming that the two coefficients in eq 15 can be obtained from experimental data if we adopt the two coefficients 6 52 and 0 15 from eq 10 eq 15 implies that the mean velocity is more correlated to a 4 6 52 compared with ε e 0 15 given that 6 52 0 15 1 this agrees with the derivation process shown in the prior phenomenological model since the ε e term in eq 15 originally arises due to the truncation error related to first order simplifications since a 4 and ε e in eq 15 are derived from the scaling analysis any higher order effects than the proposed proportional momentum transfer model must be absorbed in these two coefficients therefore further discussion on how to derive the exact values for these two coefficients are better kept for future endeavors though the momentum transfer model is limited in estimating the exact values of the two coefficients a 4 and ε e other than fitting the experimental data it is still safe to use eq 15 for the velocity prediction since it agrees with the result derived from the data driven method in addition the deviations of turbulent fluctuations for flows over some vegetated or gravel bedded channels from the open flows over the solid impermeable boundary have been reported elsewhere katul et al 2004 manes et al 2011 2012 huai et al 2019 this may plausibly suggest the suitability of applying some momentum transfer hypothesizes to explain the mechanisms that govern the bulk velocity variations for flows over permeable boundaries though eq 15 is almost identical to eq 10 eq 10 is an empirical formula which is obtained using data driven methodologies while eq 15 is derived based on the momentum transfer and its phenomenological model in the nikuradse experiments the friction factor is determined as f r 1 3 which is different from the length scale derived in the present study nikuradse s friction law cannot scale the friction resistance over the permeable wall in the present formula r p reflects the fluid resistance caused by layer i inner water layer as sketched in fig 4 and r v reflects the total friction resistance caused by the entire pipe as hydraulic radius represents the length scale of the vortex eq 15 indeed suggests that the ratio of the mean velocity to shear velocity is determined by the predominant turbulence length scale r p describes the turbulence in the inner water layer whereas r v represents the length scale of the turbulence penetrating the whole pipe both r p and r v are involved in the definition of the large scale roughness flow and they directly contribute to the mean velocity the hydraulic radius r is a direct representation of the length scale of the bulk mean velocity therefore it is reasonable to relate the mean and the shear velocities to the boundary turbulence length scale 5 conclusions the sedimentation of particles over the pipe surface in the real world is more complicated that the uniform layers of grains as used by cheng et al 2016 future work should consider more realistic morphologies hence the current work must be deemed as a necessary first step as it only accounts for some simply geometries i e the accumulated particles are assumed to be represented with uniformly distributed beads the research of turbulent flow over permeable boundary is a formidable challenge and our research must be considered as an initial step towards a better understanding of the hydrodynamics in the permeable case a set of concise formulae that predict mean turbulent velocity for a permeable walled pipe flow is proposed which is subsequently explained by a phenomenological momentum transfer model we provide an explicit formula which can systematically scale the mean velocity of permeable pipe flows the results of this study extend classic hydraulic methodology to scale the mean velocity in the permeable pipe flow and show that the mean velocity is likely to be intrinsically determined by relative turbulence length scales the proposed formula suggests that the permeable wall greatly increases bed friction thereby decreasing the mean velocity understanding the mechanisms controlling the mean velocity is crucial in engineering for example permeable walls are a natural place for microbes to accumulate and the slower moving flow can greatly influence chemical reactions bahr 1990 moreover we illustrate a useful gp based approach to determine the empirical formula for the dimensionless parameter in terms of friction factor we propose a momentum transfer model to derive the formula of the friction factor for the pipe flow over a permeable bed the momentum transfer model is combined with a phenomenological model to solve for the friction factor the analytically derived formula is consistent with a data driven method the data driven method builds on the hydraulic methodology of two extreme cases relating dimensionless dynamic parameter groups to the dimensionless morphological parameter group the gp algorithm is integrated with the hydraulic parameters in search for the best indicator to achieve this the mda data clustering approach is used and embedded in the gp algorithm the gp algorithm proves to be an efficient machine leaning method that plays an important role in geoscience and environmental engineering several possible formulae are provided by gp selecting the most suitable formula considers the lower mse the larger correlation coefficient and an acceptable level of complexity we use the validation and training data to optimize the coefficients in the model simultaneously the test data are used to assess the accuracy of the proposed formula to further investigate the performance of the present formula it is compared with the whole set of experimental data and then compared with another formula and other data available in the literature the comparison suggests that the proposed formula performs better in terms of average accuracy the proposed formula estimates the bulk mean velocity for the pipe flow over a permeable wall however the four set of data from cheng et al 2016 may not be sufficient enough to conclude the entire permeable walled pipe cases more experiments thus are required to verify the applicability of the present formula more generally finally the present formulae are derived for pipe flow which is usually driven by pressure gradients this situation is different from the open channel flow where the flow is driven by the gravity gradient future work should investigate the specific case of open channel with a porous bed declaration of interest none acknowledgments w h

6540,determining the characteristics of pipe flow and the effect of friction resistance is relevant to a variety of applications in hydraulic and hydrological engineering such as flood control river restoration and ground runoff prediction in the nikuradse s experiments the relative roughness and the bulk reynolds number are used to scale the darcy friction factor thereby determining the mean velocity recent observations using permeable walled pipes however indicate that the friction factor can significantly deviate from the results obtained in nikuradse s approach here we propose a concise model to estimate the mean velocity of the pipe flow over permeable walls the model is formulated using a data driven approach based on the analytical solution of the mean velocity and the similarity analysis dimension conservation of the two extreme cases impermeable and porous pipe flow we show that the proposed approach can derive a physically meaningful formula for the mean velocity furthermore we propose a simple momentum transfer model which confirms the findings from the data driven approach the momentum transfer model indicates that the friction factor can be scaled with two different relative hydraulics radius scales which are intrinsically determined by two different eddy sizes lastly the present approach is examined by comparing it with another approximate formula and the limited experimental data in the literature keywords mean flow velocity turbulent flow permeable boundary data driven approach momentum transfer 1 introduction over the decades the nikuradse 1950 diagram has been a key reference to address the intricate interplay among friction resistance reynolds number and pipe roughness over a non permeable boundary for example the blasius and stickler laws goldenfeld 2006 coupled with the nikuradse diagram provide two fundamental ways to explore the friction factor for hydraulically smooth and rough pipe flows traditional theories generally relate the friction factor to different flow regimes depending on the reynolds number and the relative roughness height in recent years goldenfeld 2006 used a critical temperature model to explore turbulent friction factor and combined the six nikuradse curves into a monotonic one subsequently tao 2009 improved the monotonic model and an explicit formula for the monotonic curve was given by li et al 2015a and li and huai 2016 still since pressure driven pipe systems are widely used for a variety of civil and domestic purposes analysis of the long term usage of pipes requires accounting for the case of a permeable boundary panday and huyakorn 2004 fontan et al 2013 manes et al 2011 2012 the sedimentation of particles inside a pipe acts as a layer of porous media on the surface of the pipe itself the flow structure and flow regimes are affected by the presence of a porous sedimentation layer although not investigated in this study the sedimentation layer provides an ideal environment for the growth of biofilm which greatly influences the hydraulic conductivity thereby impacting the chemical and microbiological processes inside the pipe kapellos et al 2007 peszynska et al 2016 economically the increased friction resistance generated by the obstruction of particles on the wall consumes more energy to run the pipe system which is a major concern with significant economic implications understanding the physical properties of the flow over a permeable boundary is a necessary first step before biochemical transport processes inside the pipe can be fully investigated to investigate the permeable case cheng et al 2016 conducted experiments using pvc pipes with multiple layers of grains beads to simulate pipe flow over a permeable wall the experimental configurations have been described in detail elsewhere therefore only the key information is included here fig 1 shows the experimental conditions for increasing the number of grain layers inside the pipe the grains with a mean diameter of d are uniformly attached in a smooth pipe of diameter d to mimic the permeable boundary the number of layers in each pipe is notated with n the results of the permeable pipe experiments from cheng et al 2016 are presented in fig 2 where the friction factor from the original nikuradse diagram is also included fig 2 shows that the friction resistance is much larger due to the effect of large scale grains this implies that the relative roughness height ε d where ε is the representative height of the small scale roughness elements is not sufficient to explain the friction factor furthermore the influence of the reynolds number on the friction factor is less significant compared to the relative length scale this implies that the aforementioned formulae such as the blasius and stickler laws originally derived for impermeable pipes are insufficient to address the permeable pipe flow case therefore deriving a formula to describe the flow over a permeable boundary is necessary to improve our understanding of the mechanisms that govern the characteristics of the flow discharge and the friction resistance for the permeable flow case as a first step this work aims to derive a physically meaningful and concise formula to predict the flow velocity inside a permeable walled pipe to ensure the formula is physically meaningful we will use a combination of analytical and data driven approaches we assume that the analytical solutions from two extreme cases the porous pipe flow and the darcy s flow can be used to derive the formula for the bulk mean velocity of permeable walled pipes based on the similarity principle a hybrid genetic programming algorithm gp will be employed to search for the possible solutions of mean velocity without presuming any predetermined form of the solution to explain the physics we will propose a phenomenological momentum transfer model finally the results will also be compared with the limited data available in the literature 2 materials and methods 2 1 two layer model and two extreme cases a cylindrical coordinate system of the pipe flow over a permeable walled pipe is sketched in fig 3 where r is the radius at any position θ is the cylindrical angle x is the longitudinal direction and u is the local velocity consider the steady incompressible newtonian fluid over a permeable walled pipe in a cylindrical coordinate system with r axis and longitudinal x axis aligned in the flow direction the axial naiver stokes equation can be simplified as follows 1 ρ u t u r u r u θ r u θ u u x p x ρ g x μ 1 r r r u r 1 r 2 2 u θ 2 2 u x 2 d x where u is the local velocity p is the water pressure μ is the dynamic viscosity ρ is density of the fluid g x is a component of gravitational acceleration in the x streamwise direction and d x is the total drag force generated by friction if we express the parameters in eq 1 as the sum of the mean and the local fluctuating components e g u u u where u is the ensemble mean and u is the local fluctuation then eq 1 originally from the laminar case can lead to the prognostic equations for both the mean and the fluctuating parts and thus can be extended to turbulent flow in open channel flows many models have been developed to analytically solve the navier stokes equation for example katul et al 2004 derived an amended k ε model to scale the flow regimes in a model of canopy flow here rather than attempting to directly solve eq 1 we focus on simplifying it and deriving two analytical equations for two extreme cases we then use the results as the first step to derive the mean velocity of the permeable walled pipe flow the permeable walled pipe is divided into two different layers namely the basal permeable layer and the inner water layer layer ii and i in fig 4 respectively the basal permeable layer starts from the boundary of the pipe to the top of innermost grains the remaining pipe cross section is called the inner water layer we use the term bulk pipe to refer to the entire pipe system including the basal permeable bed and the inner water layers the two extreme cases for the pipe flow over the permeable wall are called case i classic pipe flow and case ii porous pipe flow respectively as shown in fig 4 in a permeable pipe system the flow in the basal permeable layer layer ii is similar to the flow in case ii porous pipe flow which can be described as a darcy flow while layer i inner water layer is analogous to case i classic pipe flow the assumption of darcy flow is valid since the flow inside layer ii is strongly obstructed by the grains where the velocity is much smaller compared with flow in the inner water layer moreover since the grains are homogeneously distributed we assume that the velocity is uniformly distributed in layer ii with the assumption that the thickness of layer ii is higher than that of the viscous layer yang et al 2015 for the flow in the inner layer the surface of the attached grains forms a rough bed we thus consider that as a classic rough pipe flow problem therefore the basic hypothesis is that cases i classic pipe flow and ii porous pipe flow can reflect the hydraulic properties of layers i inner water layer and ii basal permeable layer of the permeable walled pipe for the two extreme conditions under case i the classic pipe flow case no grain is attached inside the pipe the mean velocity of the pipe flow in the turbulent regime under the darcy weisbach equation clark 2011 cheng et al 2016 can be given as 2 u 2 2 u 2 f where u is the mean velocity of the bulk flow u is the shear velocity defined as gd s a s a is the head loss per unit length due to pressure and gravity ergun 1952 and f is the global friction factor of the pipe the nikuradse chart shows that the friction factor f r e d is a function of the reynolds number and the relative roughness given that the reynolds number is a function of the mean velocity u the dimensionless velocity u u is expected to be determined by the length scale bed roughness and diameter d of the pipe for case ii the drag force caused by the grains for the bulk flow is approximated as 3 d x 1 2 c d a n ρ u 2 where c d is the drag coefficient of the grain because the drag only acts on the fluid within the grains which occupies a fraction of porosity n thus the total drag is divided by the porosity a a f c v is the frontal grain area per unit volume a f is the frontal area of the wetted grain cv is the control volume of the fluid and u again is the mean velocity of the flow inside the grains the pressure gradient p x and the stream wise gravitation ρ g x in a tilted pipe can be combined into one term ρ g s a where s a is the effective slope cheng et al 2016 assume that a pipe is sufficiently long in a steady state t 0 and that the flow has no swirl θ 0 so that the integration of eq 1 along r for the full grain case at any position 0 2 r d yields the following 4 r d 2 c d a 2 n ρ u 2 d r μ r d 2 1 r r r u r d r ρ g s a d 2 r most of the spatial domain is occupied by the grains in layer ii so that the permeable grain drag is more important than the surface friction on the wall of the pipe this implies that the second term on the left hand side of eq 4 is negligible therefore eq 4 can be simplified into 5 u 2 2 n g d s a c d a 2 n u 2 c d a eq 5 shows that the friction factor f can be expressed as c d a n for the basal permeable layer in the following we assume c d is a constant an assumption only valid for high reynolds numbers as given in both cases i and ii u u can be scaled by a group of morphological parameters d n n number of grain layers in the pipe and a noted that a is determined by d and d we hypothesize that the dimensionless dynamical parameter group u u for the bulk pipe flow would be scaled by another group of dimensionless morphological parameters n d d since the bed roughness height is far less than the roughness due to the grain size d the morphological parameter group thus can be simplified by using n d d in the following we aim to derive suitable equations for expressing the morphological parameters and find the explicit relationship between u u and n d d to predict the bulk mean velocity 2 2 representative length scale and phenomenological momentum transfer model for the bulk permeable walled pipe flow the five parameters corresponding to the dynamics in the system include the density ρ bulk velocity u shear velocity u pipe diameter d and grain diameter d according to buckingham s π theorem clark 2011 a functional relationship exists i e f ρ u u d d 0 where f denotes a certain unknown function furthermore since the three physical dimensions involved in this system are mass length and time the number of independent dimensionless parameter groups is two 5 3 or equivalently f 1 π 1 π 2 0 where π i is the i th dimensionless group the first dimensionless parameter group is the relative velocity scale that is π 1 u u the other group is the relative length scale which can be interpreted as the ratio of height or area the volume is not considered here due to the homogenous experimental configurations in x direction since there are three length scales the grain and pipe diameters and the height of inner water layer the total combinations of the dimensionless length scales in terms of height and area is therefore 6 c 2 1 c 4 1 the relative length scales can thus be reasonably determined by the ratio of the total height of grains d b to pipe diameter d b d 2 n d d the ratio of the total height of inner water layer h w to pipe diameter h w d 1 2 n d d the ratio of the area of flow in inner water layer to total flow area in the pipe a p a d 2 n d 2 d 2 the ratio of the area of the flow inside the grain layer to total flow area in the pipe a a a n 1 d 2 n d 2 d 2 the ratio of the area of obstruction to the flow area in the grain layer a o a 1 n 1 d 2 n d 2 d 2 and the ratio of the area of the total flow in the pipe to the total pipe area a v a n 1 n d 2 n d 2 d 2 therefore the second dimensionless group is derived as π 2 f 2 d b d h w d a p a a a a a o a a v a where f 2 is a function to be explicitly validated using experimental data the relative area scale can also be understood from the perspective of volumetric hydraulic radius identical to the definition of hydraulic radius cross section area over a wetted perimeter here we extend this concept to a three dimensional case as the total flow volume over a wetted surface for the small scale roughness element the surface area of the grains is much smaller compared with the perimeter so the perimeter is usually used for the hydraulics radius calculation for example considering a grain with a radius of r the ratio of surface area to perimeter is given as π r 2 2 π r r 2 it is evident that as r increases the surface area is more and more important compared with the perimeter this exemplifies the necessity of using the area ratio for flow over large scale roughness scenarios therefore a similar volumetric hydraulic radius can be proposed as the total volume of the control system cv versus the wetted area as a result three newly defined volumetric hydraulic radius correspondingly are given as r p cv a p r a c v a a r v c v a v it is easy to see that r p reflects the wetted frontal surface area of the inner water layer while r v is the description of the total wetted frontal area in a permeable pipe the next step is to solve the first dimensionless group as a function of the second group namely solving the equation π 1 π 2 3 data driven approach 3 1 data cluster to approximate the equation π 1 π 2 we use the data reported from cheng et al 2016 in nikuradse s pipe flow experiment turbulence occurs when the reynolds number is approximately 2300 for the case of an emergent canopy flow which is similar to the present permeable pipe experiments nepf 1999 nikora et al 2007 and liu et al 2008 have shown that the stream wise velocity in the bottom inner water layer is small as governed by darcy s law furthermore other studies from cheng 2011 huthoff et al 2007 and li et al 2015b have assumed that the flow regimes are primarily turbulent in the upper layers therefore in the present paper we select data whose reynolds number is larger than 2000 assuming π 2 is a single variable function of the aforementioned six relative length scales d b d h w d a p a a a a a o a a v a then π 1 is plotted versus each dimensionless length scale in fig 5 fig 5 shows a monotonic relationship between u and a proposed dimensional shear velocity however the different dependencies exact physical relations between dimensional shear velocity and the defined six length scales d b d h w d a p a a a a a o a a v a indicate that we need to explore more suitable expressions for the mean velocity to systematically explore the relation concealed in the function π 1 π 2 a hybrid genetic programming gp algorithm an approach initially proposed by koza 1992 and embedded in the software eureqa by schmidt and lipson 2009 2013 is employed to disclose the relation between bulk velocity and morphological parameters we use gp because it is not necessary to hypothesize a pre determined form for the model due to the intrinsic iterative search process aytek and kişi 2008 kisi et al 2012 roushangar et al 2014 shi et al 2019 in the derivation of the target model several groups of parameters that construct the model space should be defined and the functional relations should be chosen i e plus minus times divide exponent and logarithm if we choose too many operators and dimensionless parameters the model dimension will increase rapidly and it will become impenetrable in terms of physical meaning the final formulae will be selected with a principle of lower mean square error mse and higher correlation coefficient r 2 to clarify the data from cheng et al 2016 are used for the gp training and validation the data from huang et al 2013 are only used for comparison in the test section cheng s data are initially separated into training validation and testing subsets the training group is used to feed the gp algorithm and develop predictors the optimization of a certain formula stops when the performance decays on the validation subset a subset that has never been used for deriving the formula formula performance is finally evaluated on the testing subset a subset that has never been used during the previous steps 3 2 data selection to find a proper formula to scale the mean velocity the 271 sets of observed data from cheng et al 2016 are used to train the gp algorithm as well as to verify and test the proposed formula to yield a better predictor it is better to conduct data pre processing standardizing the dataset into a suitable range bowden et al 2002 kohonen 1990 solidoro et al 2007 the 271 sets of data are first standardized 6 x n x x m std x where x m is the mean value of the data x n is the normalized data and s t d x is the standard deviation the maximum dissimilarity algorithm mda recommended by camus et al 2011 is employed to select the data for the training group the purpose of the mda method is to select a subset of size m from the data bank of size n which can be considered representative of the entire data bank considering a data bank expressed as x x 1 x 2 x 3 x n and the subset defined as s s 1 s 2 s 3 s m then the selection steps are the following first decide the size of the subset s no clear rule exists but for example matter 1997 suggested to used 35 samples of the data bank while brown and martin 1997 argued that 20 of the data should be used flood and kartam 1994 indicated that more data sets used would increase the accuracy of the formulae some detailed discussion of the size selection can be refer found goldstein et al 2013 goldstein and coco 2014 and tinoco et al 2015 here 35 of the data are selected as the training in the present study the remaining data are randomly split between validation 85 and testing 15 second set an initial value of the subset as s 0 in this study the initial vector of the subset for mda is chosen as the one with the largest euclidean distance danielsson 1980 from the origin third calculate the dissimilarity based on euclidean distance if the vectors s j from the subset are composed of y y m value then the vector x i from the data bank should thus have n y instances therefore the euclidean distance between the vector x i from the data bank and the vector s j from the subset can be computed as 7 t i j x i s j 2 i 1 2 n y j 1 2 y the dissimilarity defined by the minimum euclidean distance is thus obtained as 8 t i s u b m i n x i s j 2 i 1 2 n y j 1 2 y finally select the data which has the largest t i s u b maximum dissimilarity and set the data as s y 1 the data are selected repetitively until the number m of subset s is 35 n as a result a 7 dimensional normalized data bank comprising 271 vectors is constructed this selection aims to choose the most suitable subset to represent the data bank the training data are shown in fig 6 4 result and discussion 4 1 gp results the ideal solution form should be as simple as feasible have lower mean square error mse between predicted and observed values and have larger correlation coefficient r 2 six relatively strong models suggested by gp algorithms are selected and presented in table 1 the mse and r 2 values are shown in fig 7 the optimal solution must be the points with maximum distance between the blued solid line and the black dashed line but have smaller complexity according to fig 7 when the complexity is 7 9 and 11 there is a largest distance between the mse and the r 2 lines therefore we choose the expressions with complexity 7 as optimal solutions which indicates the bulk mean velocity have the form 9 u a 1 a p a v a 2 a 2 u 4 2 determination of empirical coefficients in table 1 the coefficients are determined with the data selected to train the gp which consists of 95 sets of data now to optimized a 1 and a 2 all the 95 sets of training data fig 5 and 146 randomly selected validation data from cheng et al 2016 are used based on the least mean square errors mse method the mse for different a 1 and a 2 values are shown in fig 8 where the quantitative analysis suggests that the optimal values for a 1 and a 2 are 6 52 and 0 15 respectively using the proposed volumetric hydraulic radius and the optimized coefficients eq 9 is rearranged into the following 10 u 6 52 r 2 r p r v 0 15 u 4 3 test and comparison first to verify the proposed formula the remaining 30 data which are not used in optimizing the coefficients a 1 and a 2 are used to test the accuracy of eq 10 the testing results are displayed in fig 9 the relative error e r is computed as observation prediction observation the figure indicates that 90 points have an error lower than 6 and only one point has an error of 10 second for the flow over a permeable wall the formula is similar to the one proposed by ferguson 2007 which can only calculate the case when n 1 and was derived using data collected from an open channel with flow over permeable sediment bed 11 u a 3 d d u where a 3 is an empirical coefficient it should be noted that eq 11 only applies to the scenario where n 1 no formula however is available to predict the mean velocity for the pipe flow over the permeable wall when n is larger than one the comparison between eq 10 and eq 11 is shown in fig 10 fig 10 shows that both present eq 10 and ferguson s eq 11 can predict mean velocity for the case when n 1 since most of the relative errors are under 5 however present eq 10 is more applicable since it can also predict the cases when n is larger than one finally the five sets of data from huang et al 2013 which have not been used in previous training validating and testing process are used in fig 11 notice that the porosity is estimated from the number of the grains used since the experiments conditions of huang et al 2013 and facilities are different from cheng et al 2016 and the representative slope gradients are not reported from huang s study we thus simply keep the physical parameters in eqs 10 and 11 and optimize the coefficients using the same mse method the best coefficients for a 1 a 2 and a 3 are 6 37 0 42 and 0 27 respectively fig 11 shows that both present eq 10 and ferguson s eq 11 can predict mean velocity for the case when n 1 for data from huang et al 2013 however eq 10 is slightly better since 4 5 of the data have relative error lower than 5 and all relative errors are lower than 10 4 4 phenomenological momentum transfer model to explain eq 10 we start from the phenomenological model of the friction factor we hypothesize that two kind of vortices can be generated the large scale roughness vortex which is induced by the large grains and the small scale roughness vortex which is due to the surface roughness of the permeable pipe as described by kolmogorov clark 2011 since the small scale surface roughness is far less than the large scale grain size we only need to consider the large scale roughness in the permeable walled pipe flow for the large scale roughness we simply consider two types of vortices that are generated due to the strong and weak effects of the large scale grains naturally we assume that the weak effect vortex exists near the boundary of layer i inner water layer in fig 4 similarly the strong effect vortex can be found somewhere in layer ii basal permeable layer where the flow structure is greatly influenced by the large size grains we can understand this by considering the grains as a type of obstruction when the flow approaches the surface of the obstruction the flow structure is influencing by the surface and the geometry boundary layer property of the obstruction generally the more the flow is close to the obstruction the more strongly the flow structure is affected based on this principle we assume that boundary of layer i inner water layer in fig 4 is the critical surface where the flow is to be influenced by the grains we conjecture that a type of weak effect vortex exists in this region similarly an opposite strong effect vortex thus forms where the flow structure is strongly influenced by the grains according to the prior principle the place where the strong effect vortex forms must be somewhere between the boundary of the inner water layer and the surface of the pipe i e in the basal permeable layer the weak effect and strong effect vortices are closely related to the inner water and the basal permeable layers respectively now if we express the bulk flow with a velocity scale u and a length scale r which is the volumetric hydraulics radius then the partial flow confined by the boundary where the weak effect vortex occurs can be similarly represented by the velocity and length scales i e v p the layer mean velocity and the volumetric hydraulics radius r p respectively correspondingly the flow layer involved in the generation of strong effect vortex can be represented with the velocity and length scales v v and r v these expressions are reasonable since the velocities and the length scales for weak effect and strong effect vortices are closely associated with the inner water and the basal permeable layers respectively since for any flow layer with length scale r and velocity scale u over a unit surface area the corresponding momentum transfer rate is represented as ϕ ρ v r 2 mass velocity surface area the momentum fluxes of a unit scale per volume for the two strong and week effect flow layers can be computed as ϕ v ρ v v r v 2 and ϕ p ρ v p r p 2 these fluxes are related to large scale roughness and can be understood as the momentum transfer rate between layers since the momentum fluxes of those two strong and weak effect flow layers is not the same we simply use the geometric mean momentum flux ϕ v ϕ p to represent the momentum transfer rate between those two strong and week effect flow layers if we assume that the global momentum flux ρ v r 2 is proportional to the geometric average between the momentum fluxes of small and large scale vortex i e ϕ ϕ v ϕ p then a proportional scaling is derived as 12 v v v p u r v r p r 2 for the small scale roughness case i e in classic pipe flow and open flow in a rectangular channel gioia and bombardelli 2001 used a phenomenological approach to derive the turbulent stress τ the reynolds stress is given as τ ρ v n v t where v n and v t are fluctuating velocities normal and tangent to the wet surface respectively moreover such two fluctuating velocities are assumed to be separately scaled with the characteristic velocity associated with small roughness of size r and the mean velocity of the flow dominated by the hydraulic radius namely v n u r and v t u where u r is the small scale roughness induced velocity considering these conditions gioia and bombardelli 2001 concluded that v n v t u r u this assumption was subsequently adopted by katul et al 2002 in a two layer model to estimate the manning coefficients and the depth average velocity of submerged vegetated flow however for the case of a permeable pipe which is a large scale roughness problem such hypothesis no longer holds to derive a phenomenological model we introduce fig 12 in the case of the permeable walled pipe flow the space occupied by the large grains cannot be ignored thus the tangent fluctuating velocity v t should be closely related to the mean flow velocity of the total vacant area a v which is v v instead of u note that u q a i e v t v v further the normal fluctuating velocity is assumed to be scaled with v p the bulk mean velocity of the inner water later since v p is not equal to v v a velocity shear between the inner water layer and the porous grained layer is induced also as v p is much larger than v v the normal fluctuating velocity v n should be on the same order of v p this leads to the assumption v n v p therefore using this phenomenological model the turbulence shear stress τ ρ v n v t near the wall can be rewritten as 13 τ ρ v v v p eq 13 physically suggests that the characteristic shear stress for the permeable walled pipe flow is determined by two different mean velocity scales in the inner water and the basal permeable layers respectively now if eq 13 is divided by ρ u 2 on both the left hand and right hand sides then it leads to a scaling for the friction factor as f v v v p u 2 furthermore substituting eq 12 into such scaling yields 14 f r p r r v r 2 eq 14 shows that the friction factor in the permeable bed is determined by the relative length scales of the two large scale roughness vortices this result is in line with previous studies showing that small scale roughness vortices alone cannot be used to explain friction for the flow over permeable beds cheng et al 2016 ferguson 2007 rearranging eq 14 yields a formula to compute the mean velocity as 15 u u a 4 r 2 r p r v ε e where a 4 is a constant coefficient and ε e is the truncation error indicating any other high order terms which also contribute to the friction factor but the sum of those are negligible compared with the first term on the right hand side of the equation eq 15 is consistent with the result in eq 10 assuming that the two coefficients in eq 15 can be obtained from experimental data if we adopt the two coefficients 6 52 and 0 15 from eq 10 eq 15 implies that the mean velocity is more correlated to a 4 6 52 compared with ε e 0 15 given that 6 52 0 15 1 this agrees with the derivation process shown in the prior phenomenological model since the ε e term in eq 15 originally arises due to the truncation error related to first order simplifications since a 4 and ε e in eq 15 are derived from the scaling analysis any higher order effects than the proposed proportional momentum transfer model must be absorbed in these two coefficients therefore further discussion on how to derive the exact values for these two coefficients are better kept for future endeavors though the momentum transfer model is limited in estimating the exact values of the two coefficients a 4 and ε e other than fitting the experimental data it is still safe to use eq 15 for the velocity prediction since it agrees with the result derived from the data driven method in addition the deviations of turbulent fluctuations for flows over some vegetated or gravel bedded channels from the open flows over the solid impermeable boundary have been reported elsewhere katul et al 2004 manes et al 2011 2012 huai et al 2019 this may plausibly suggest the suitability of applying some momentum transfer hypothesizes to explain the mechanisms that govern the bulk velocity variations for flows over permeable boundaries though eq 15 is almost identical to eq 10 eq 10 is an empirical formula which is obtained using data driven methodologies while eq 15 is derived based on the momentum transfer and its phenomenological model in the nikuradse experiments the friction factor is determined as f r 1 3 which is different from the length scale derived in the present study nikuradse s friction law cannot scale the friction resistance over the permeable wall in the present formula r p reflects the fluid resistance caused by layer i inner water layer as sketched in fig 4 and r v reflects the total friction resistance caused by the entire pipe as hydraulic radius represents the length scale of the vortex eq 15 indeed suggests that the ratio of the mean velocity to shear velocity is determined by the predominant turbulence length scale r p describes the turbulence in the inner water layer whereas r v represents the length scale of the turbulence penetrating the whole pipe both r p and r v are involved in the definition of the large scale roughness flow and they directly contribute to the mean velocity the hydraulic radius r is a direct representation of the length scale of the bulk mean velocity therefore it is reasonable to relate the mean and the shear velocities to the boundary turbulence length scale 5 conclusions the sedimentation of particles over the pipe surface in the real world is more complicated that the uniform layers of grains as used by cheng et al 2016 future work should consider more realistic morphologies hence the current work must be deemed as a necessary first step as it only accounts for some simply geometries i e the accumulated particles are assumed to be represented with uniformly distributed beads the research of turbulent flow over permeable boundary is a formidable challenge and our research must be considered as an initial step towards a better understanding of the hydrodynamics in the permeable case a set of concise formulae that predict mean turbulent velocity for a permeable walled pipe flow is proposed which is subsequently explained by a phenomenological momentum transfer model we provide an explicit formula which can systematically scale the mean velocity of permeable pipe flows the results of this study extend classic hydraulic methodology to scale the mean velocity in the permeable pipe flow and show that the mean velocity is likely to be intrinsically determined by relative turbulence length scales the proposed formula suggests that the permeable wall greatly increases bed friction thereby decreasing the mean velocity understanding the mechanisms controlling the mean velocity is crucial in engineering for example permeable walls are a natural place for microbes to accumulate and the slower moving flow can greatly influence chemical reactions bahr 1990 moreover we illustrate a useful gp based approach to determine the empirical formula for the dimensionless parameter in terms of friction factor we propose a momentum transfer model to derive the formula of the friction factor for the pipe flow over a permeable bed the momentum transfer model is combined with a phenomenological model to solve for the friction factor the analytically derived formula is consistent with a data driven method the data driven method builds on the hydraulic methodology of two extreme cases relating dimensionless dynamic parameter groups to the dimensionless morphological parameter group the gp algorithm is integrated with the hydraulic parameters in search for the best indicator to achieve this the mda data clustering approach is used and embedded in the gp algorithm the gp algorithm proves to be an efficient machine leaning method that plays an important role in geoscience and environmental engineering several possible formulae are provided by gp selecting the most suitable formula considers the lower mse the larger correlation coefficient and an acceptable level of complexity we use the validation and training data to optimize the coefficients in the model simultaneously the test data are used to assess the accuracy of the proposed formula to further investigate the performance of the present formula it is compared with the whole set of experimental data and then compared with another formula and other data available in the literature the comparison suggests that the proposed formula performs better in terms of average accuracy the proposed formula estimates the bulk mean velocity for the pipe flow over a permeable wall however the four set of data from cheng et al 2016 may not be sufficient enough to conclude the entire permeable walled pipe cases more experiments thus are required to verify the applicability of the present formula more generally finally the present formulae are derived for pipe flow which is usually driven by pressure gradients this situation is different from the open channel flow where the flow is driven by the gravity gradient future work should investigate the specific case of open channel with a porous bed declaration of interest none acknowledgments w h

6541,accurate forecasting of hourly suspended sediment concentration is a critical issue for reservoir management especially during typhoon periods this research proposes a two stage forecasting approach integrating numerical and machine learning based models to provide accurate real time forecasts of half hourly suspended sediment concentration in the first stage the density current model srh2d was verified and applied by the historical typhoon events due to the lack of measured suspended sediment concentration next in the second stage the calculated results from srh2d based on the spatial temporal relation were employed as the input of the mgsvm based model finally an application in the shi men reservoir was conducted to demonstrate the forecasting performance of the proposed approach the results indicated that the calculated data from the srh2d model corresponded to the trend of measured data in spatial temporal variation moreover the proposed forecasting approach enables reasonably acceptable 0 5 to 3 h ahead forecasts of suspended sediment concentration by using the simulated data of half hourly suspended sediment concentration the accurate forecast conducted by the proposed approach is expected to be properly applied to reservoir management keywords suspended sediment concentration forecasting density current reservoir multi objective genetic algorithm support vector machine typhoon 1 introduction understanding and quantifying the dynamics of suspended sediment transport phenomenon in reservoirs and other water bodies are essential in implementing appropriate mitigation measures to prevent sediment deposition sivakumar 2002 cobaner et al 2009 in recent years the problems of the active storage and the estimated lifespan of reservoirs have been attracted much attention in the world wisser et al 2013 the reservoir sedimentation issue is regarded as the urgent subject in the current period solving the subject of reservoir deposition therefore is already a universal value nonetheless the evolution of reservoir sedimentation is an extremely complex transport mechanism in this process suspended sediment mixed with water flows into the reservoir and released to downstream river partly after typhoon events unreleased sediment would fall down and deposit on the bottom of the reservoir and affects the active reservoir storage capacity observing the operation of the most reservoirs for decades the deposition rate was confirmed to be higher than the original estimation due to climate change caused the yielded sediment increased during typhoon period the effective desiltation strategy must be formulated in order to achieve the goal of reservoir sustainable development grasping the sediment movement behavior in the reservoir area and then estimating its future movement will be the primary condition for success the high accurate prediction of suspended sediment concentration is seriously difficult because of the complexity of the physical mechanism of the density current density current flow is a particular flow pattern that happens as the specific gravity of the inflow turbidity water is greater than that of the water in the reservoir high density water dives to the bottom and flows under the relatively clean water meanwhile stratification phenomena are observed between the two fluids of different densities a conceptual model is able to represent reality due to the conceptual background of the model and also helpful for that the model was constructed as using the data out of the range babovic 2009 therefore the travel pattern of the density current flow should be grasped in the first stage by a reliable data based on a conceptual model within the field of data analytics the sufficient high quality measured data of suspended sediment concentration for machine learning based prediction models is essential however the measured data during typhoons are usually insufficient because extreme flood disaster leads to a harsh environment to interrupt the measurement of the suspended sediment concentration the construction of reliably accurate machine learning based prediction models using the insufficient measured data are relatively difficult therefore a stable and consistent method for instance numerical model should be adopted to make up for the incomplete measured data in the past decades numerous numerical models were developed to investigate the density current flow lai et al 2015 developed a 2d layer averaged model srh2d which could be used to estimate the travel velocity and the average concentration of the density current moreover srh2d has been applied in the down scale physical model of the shi men reservoir and earn the reasonable result hence srh2d which can assist in obtaining a satisfactory result of density current flow is further considered to be applied in this paper accurate prediction of suspended sediment concentration to reduce reservoir deposition for maintaining the reservoir storage capacity plays a significant role in reservoir management kişi 2004 halbe et al 2013 an attractive method for predicting suspended sediment concentration based on machine learning technique could be embedded such as neural networks nns which have been successfully used in real time forecasting for various fields even though the intrinsic structure and behavior of suspended sediment concentration is not absolutely characterized by researchers the proper behavior of the system can be predicted by the category of models including statistical approaches and nns babovic 2009 in addition nns have been gradually applied into different modeling fields and currently regarded as principal approaches for integrating various sources of information babovic 2000 nns have also been widely applied to the suspended sediment problem in the past years especially for the simulation and prediction of daily suspended sediment concentration zounemat kermani et al 2016 malik et al 2017 alizadeh et al 2017 in the past periods physical conceptual models have been combined with machine learning methods to improve forecasting or modeling of target variables babovic et al 2001 yu et al 2004 azamathullah et al 2010 ghani et al 2011 loukas and vasiliades 2014 combined the hydrological model and the artificial neural networks anns for rainfall runoff modeling procedures young and liu 2015 used physically based and artificial neural network hybrid model to model and predict rainfall runoff during typhoon events yu et al 2004 combined chaos theory and support vector machine svm with a large sample data record for 1 lead day flow prediction sannasiraj et al 2004 combined the best of a deterministic model and a stochastic model to improve the daily predictability of the tidal variation sun et al 2010 combined chaos theory and time delay based neural networks to enhance the accuracy of the tidal prediction karri et al 2013 used ensemble kalman filter enkf based data to deal with the limitation of the measurement technique and developed the forecasts result significantly humphrey et al 2016 explored a hybrid approach using the simulated soil moisture from a conceptual rainfall runoff model and a bayesian artificial neural network statistical forecasting model for monthly streamflow forecasting furthermore numerous previous studies have mostly employed ann based or neuro fuzzy models to simulate or predict daily suspended sediment concentration lohani et al 2007 agarwal et al 2009 cobaner et al 2009 rajaee et al 2009 kişi 2010 liu et al 2013 afan et al 2015 kumar et al 2016 ghose and samantaray 2018 however little application of various machine learning based models to forecast suspended sediment concentration was performed especially on half hourly suspended sediment concentration forecasting during typhoons therefore we integrate numerical and machine learning based models to overcome the lack of sufficient high quality measured data of suspended sediment concentration in this paper a density current model was established to simulate half hourly suspended sediment concentration which are consistent with the sediment transport mechanisms the simulated data were provided as the input for training and testing the machine learning based models in addition one of the most important steps for the construction procedure of machine learning based prediction models is the determination of critical input variables bowden et al 2005 lin and jhong 2015 in general all of the potential input variables are not equally informative because of the noisy or low significant relationship with the desired output bowden et al 2005 hence input selection algorithms need to be able to determine the strength of the relationship between potential model inputs and outputs and should take into account implicitly the redundancy in candidate model inputs fernando et al 2009 galelli et al 2014 more recently a mgsvm based model integrating multi objective genetic algorithm moga and svm has been successfully developed in rainfall and inundation forecasting lin et al 2013 lin and jhong 2015 jhong et al 2016 according to the results of these previous studies the mgsvm based model is not only able to determine whether each input is used but also optimize lag lengths of input variables to simultaneously consider the complicated relationship between all inputs with their determined lag lengths despite the application of various machine learning based models to forecast suspended sediment concentration little research has been performed on half hourly suspended sediment concentration forecasting especially during typhoons therefore the aforementioned reasonable justification has prompted us to employ the mgsvm based model on half hourly suspended sediment concentration forecasting during typhoons the purpose of this paper is to provide accurate real time forecasts of half hourly suspended sediment concentration during typhoons a two stage forecasting approach integrating numerical and machine learning based models is proposed in this paper in the first stage the density current model srh2d is adopted to investigate the density movement suspended sediment concentration variation along the reservoir moreover the calculated results from srh2d based on the spatial temporal relation were employed as the input of the mgsvm based model in the second stage an application in the shi men reservoir was conducted to demonstrate the forecasting performance of the proposed approach the results of density current movement forecasting model performance and the optimal input combination are further discussed the contribution of this paper is expected to provide useful information for reservoir operation 2 the proposed two stage forecasting approach in order to achieve the goal for half hourly suspended sediment concentration forecasting at the dam face a two stage approach integrating the numerical i e the density current model and machine learning based i e the mgsvm based model models is proposed in this paper the flowchart of the proposed forecasting approach is shown in fig 1 in the first stage the measured data of suspended sediment concentration inflow and outflow discharge were collected for the numerical verification by the density current flow pattern of three historical typhoon events from 2015 to 2016 then the temporal spatial relation was obtained and the application of the relation were extended to more typhoons from 2007 to 2016 in the second stage the simulated suspended sediment concentration along the reservoir were produced and the measured data of suspended sediment concentration at the dam face were used as the input of mgsvm based model then the parameters were set for the mgsvm based modeling the pareto optimal solutions on the pareto front were produced and the pareto optimal solution with the minimum input number were finally determined as the optimal input combination the detailed methodologies of the physically conceptual and machine learning based models are presented as follows 2 1 suspended sediment concentration simulation an adopted 2d layer averaged density current model srh2d was developed by lai et al 2015 the mass conservation equation and momentum equations were adopted to calculate the hydraulic phenomena then the non equilibrium sediment transport equation in the water column and the bed elevation change equation at the bed surface were based on the mass conservation law to simulate besides the erosional rate potential term may be computed by any of the traditional sediment transport equations which compute the equilibrium or capacity sediment concentration in srh2d the equation of engelund and hansen 1972 is adopted due to the success reported by lai et al 2015 for density current flow the engelund hansen equation as rewritten by hassanzadeh et al 2011 was shown in lai et al 2015 based on the above governing equations the travel time and the suspended sediment concentration can be simulated by srh2d and then the spatial temporal variation can be calculated by three verified cases the outcomes of the number of typhoon events nev would further provide to stage 2 and launch half hourly suspended sediment concentration forecasting 2 2 half hourly suspended sediment concentration forecasting in order to provide accurate forecasts of half hourly suspended sediment concentration the high quality measured data of suspended sediment concentration is critical to the forecasting model however because of the insufficiency of the precisely measured data along the reservoir the simulated data resulted from the density current model is provided as the input of the mgsvm based model which integrates multi objective genetic algorithm moga and support vector machine svm for suspended sediment concentration forecasting as shown in fig 1 in the process of the suspended sediment concentration forecasting the number of input variables lag lengths of input variables number of iterations number of populations and mutation probability were regarded as the parameters of the mgsvm based model and set for forecasting modeling according to the chromosome encoding and population generation the input combinations would be prepared for the implement of the svm algorithm more mathematical details about svm can be found in some text books vapnik 1995 1998 cristianini and shaw taylor 2000 based on the basic theory of moga the evaluation for the fitness values of chromosomes is based on objective functions the values of objective functions should be transformed properly into the fitness values a chromosome with a nonnegative high fitness value represents that is a good solution chromosomes of the moga are composed of different input variables the real valued encoding for a chromosome is used in this paper in the moga the domination concept making a comparison to determine whether one solution dominates the other or not is applied to determine pareto optimal solutions most mogas use the domination concept to find the pareto optimal solutions based on the domination concept of the moga all of the non dominated solutions which are also called pareto optimal solutions can be found hence mogas are especially appropriate to solve the multi objective nonlinear optimization problems to simplify the complexity of the mgsvm based models in the training phase two performance measures often used in evaluating hydrological models are considered as objective functions for the model training in this paper generalized pareto based scale independent fitness function gpsiff which is a simple method to determine pareto optimal solutions jhong et al 2016 is used herein after running the svm algorithm the fitness value of each chromosome in the population can be evaluated using the gpsiff that considers the objective functions for dominated and non dominated solutions in the pareto space in this paper the number of iteration is employed as the stopping condition murata et al 1996 when the specific stopping condition was satisfied mogas would be stopped the pareto optimal solutions would be found from the population and the elite set otherwise go to the selection step moreover the three operations i e selection crossover and mutation operate the population from the basics of the mogas the reason for the application of the mgsvm as the forecasting model is because of its several advantages 1 the model is able to determine if the input variable should be used or not 2 lag lengths of input variables can be optimized by the model therefore the mgsvm based model is recommended to be integrated with the physically conceptual model for suspended sediment concentration forecasting 3 application 3 1 study area and data the shi men reservoir in the middle reach of the dahan river was selected to be the research site the shi men reservoir is located between taoyuan city and hsinchu county which is the first multi functional reservoir in taiwan it was constructed from july 1956 to june 1964 and operated in the same year the location of the shi men reservoir is shown in fig 2 table 1 lists typhoon events from 2008 to 2016 used in this paper typhoons soudelor dujuan and megi were used to verify the density current model in the first stage and all typhoon events were used for the training and testing of the mgsvm based model the lifespan of the shi men reservoir has been overestimated after observation of its operation during several serious typhoon events the first huge typhoon event typhoon gloria occurred one year before the operation of the reservoir the incoming fluid carried the great amount of sediment and caused the deposition reaching 19 47 million m3 in 1996 typhoon herb accumulated about 8 67 million m3 deposition of the shi men reservoir after the typhoon herb 123 check dams located at the upstream of the shi men reservoir were almost filled with sediment the results showed that the amount of inflow sediment was much more than 8 67 million m3 the deposition became a significant threat after the 1999 chi chi earthquake due to the annual sediment yield of the upstream watershed has increased the most serious typhoon event occurred after 5 years the storage capacity was reduced by 28 91 million m3 because of the inflow sediment more than before three years later 2007 typhoon wipha attacked the shi men reservoir and declined 9 62 million m3 of storage capacity according to the field measured data the average annual rate of sediment accumulation increased from 1 71 million m3 1964 to 1998 to 2 66 million m3 1999 to 2015 the remaining capacity of the reservoir was 67 37 which means the reservoir had lost 101 86 million m3 of water storage capacity the cumulative deposition of the shi men reservoir is shown in fig 3 after several serious typhoon events the shi men reservoir had already lost 32 63 of its storage capacity according to the united geotech inc 2015 the average annual inflow sediment is 3 53 million m3 besides the effect of an upstream catchment is estimated to be less than 0 11 million m3 per year hence 3 42 million m3 of sediment will flow into the reservoir every year the tremendous amount of sediment not only affects the reservoir s capacity but also reduces its water supply function therefore to understand the sediment movement and further formulate the reservoir operation strategy the maintenance of the existing storage capacity is a key issue compared to the other reservoirs in taiwan the shi men reservoir has relatively complete observation data at present 8 observation platforms are located along the reservoir function s32 s24 s20r s20l s15 s12r s12l and s07 six measured points were located at the dam front including spillway diversion tunnel flushing tunnel permanent outlet pro power plant intake ppi and shi men main canal smc two measured points ppi and smc which are located at the lower elevation of the shi men reservoir near the reservoir bed were adopted in this paper the relative location of the above mentioned monitoring site is also shown in fig 2 the facilities at the shi men reservoir are shown in fig 4 3 2 construction of the forecasting model in this paper the 0 5 to 3 h ahead forecasts of half hourly suspended sediment concentration are desired based on the calibrated result of density current model the simulated data of suspended sediment concentration at all observation platforms are used as the input data of the mgsvm based models the measured data of measured points at the dam front are also used as the input and output of the mgsvm based models as to the parameter setting a chromosome of the moga is composed of input variables the real valued encoding is used to determine lag lengths of input variables for a chromosome herein each input variable is constructed into 3 real valued digits and the range of each input variable is from 0 to 3 meaning that the exclusion of the input variable is possible as well the numbers of iteration and population are respectively 20 and 300 the mutation probability is set as 0 1 the general form of the mgsvm based model in this paper is written as 1 c p t δ t f mgsvm s 1 t s 1 t 1 s 1 t l 1 1 s 2 t s 2 t 1 s 2 t l 2 1 s m t s m t 1 s m t l m 1 c p t c p t 1 c p t l p 1 where p and t represent the measured point and time respectively δ t is the lead time period i e 0 5 1 1 5 2 2 5 and 3 h c p t δ t is the forecasted suspended sediment concentration resulted from the mgsvm based model for the measured point p at time t δ t s m t denotes the simulated concentration resulted from the numerical model at the observation platforms located along the reservoir function at time t because 8 observation platforms s32 s24 s20r s20l s15 s12r s12l and s07 are located along the reservoir function m is equaled to 8 herein c p t denotes the observed concentration or the measured point p at time t in addition l m denotes the lag length of the simulated concentration at m th observation platform l p means the lag length of the observed concentration at the measured point p in this paper two frequently used performance measures coefficient of efficiency ce and correlation coefficient cc are used as the objective functions of the mgsvm based models for the training phase the ce is often used to assess the forecasting ability of hydrological models ce is sensitive to peak flow and cc represents the linear dependence between the two variables under consideration chadalawada and babovic 2019 if the forecasts are perfect the ce and cc values are equal to one the forms of performance measures ce and cc are described as follows 2 ce ρ 1 n ev i 1 n ev 1 t 1 n c t c t ρ 2 t 1 n c t c 2 i 3 c c ρ 1 n ev i 1 n ev t 1 n c t c c t ρ c ρ t 1 n c t c 2 t 1 n c t ρ c ρ 2 i where c t and c t ρ are respectively the simulated suspended sediment concentration resulted from the density current model and the forecasted concentration resulted from the mgsvm based models at time t n is the number of forecasts ρ means a combination of model inputs used as training data n ev is the number of typhoon events c is the average of the simulated concentration c ρ is the average of the forecasted concentration to highlight the improvement in forecasting performance due to the use of the mgsvm based model several traditional machine learning methods such as back propagation network bpn and radial basis function network rbfn were used to compare with the mgsvm based models recently several machine learning methods based on the processes that the forecasting timestep is used as an input for the next lead time for lead time forecasting have been paid more attention trafalis et al 2002 chattopadhyay 2007 choubin et al 2016 therefore the feed forward bpn and rbfn were used to compare with the mgsvm based model in this paper the general forms of the bpn and rbfn based models in this paper are written as 4 c p t 1 f bpn s 1 t s 2 t s m t c p t 5 c p t δ t f bpn s 1 t s 2 t s m t c p

performance of the mgsvm based models mean absolute error mae was selected as other two performance measures the mae is a common performance criterion used to measure the agreement between the average simulated and observed values chadalawada and babovic 2019 the smaller the mae value the better the model performance the form of mae is described as follows 8 mae 1 n ev i 1 n ev 1 n t 1 n c t c t i in addition the critical success index csi jolliffe et al 2012 wilks 2011 was adopted to evaluate the forecast accuracy of the three models in this paper the evaluative criteria are the error percentage of the difference between the observation and the forecasting value by time series if the error percentage is lower than 10 it can determine as hit or when it higher than 10 it will seem as miss the equation of critical success index is shown as below 9 csi c h c h c m 100 where c h is the number of hit for each lead time c m is the number of miss for each lead time in general the collected events are often separated into training and testing parts for the development of nn based models jhong et al 2017 the architectures and the weights of nn based models are respectively determined and adjusted using training data then the performance of the trained nn based models is tested by the testing data that are not used in the training step nevertheless different selections of training and testing data usually yield different results and sometimes cause different conclusions jhong et al 2016 2017 in order to prevent such a problem cross validations are conducted to evaluate the model performance each single typhoon event was used as a testing event to test the nn based models in turn and the remaining events are used as training events it should be noted that 2013 typhoon soulik yielded the maximum suspended sediment concentration so the event should be used as training data conclusions are then drawn on the basis of the overall performance for the 10 events 4 results and discussion 4 1 density current movement the travel velocity of the density current is a mentioned subject in reservoir management because of the appropriate hydraulic desilting timing relies on the accuracy of the arrival time therefore accurate estimation of the arrival time of the density current can help to improve the sediment release efficiency and save water resources table 2 showed the comparison of the arrival time of typhoon soudelor dujuan and megi along the reservoir in the shi men reservoir s32 at the location of 16 200 m is defined to the inflow boundary in addition s24 is located at 9 100 m s20 is located at 7 700 m s15 is located at 5 800 m s12 is located at 4 200 m and s07 is located at 1 200 m these sections were adopted to evaluate the difference between measured and simulated data the measured data show that the peak concentration of typhoon soudelor took about 9 5 h to arrive at s07 from s32 the simulation is very close to the observation with a value of 9 28 h in addition the comparison of the measured and simulated results between each section still showed a fit tendency the times required to travel from 16 200 m to 7 700 m were recorded as 3 and 2 75 h by observation and simulation and then the area is wide from 7 700 m to 5 800 m and caused the travel pattern of the density current slows down the travel time was 3 h for the measured data and 3 39 h for the simulated results after passing through the wider area the density current goes through a narrow location the travel velocity increases in speed up the density current the density current takes 1 50 and 1 15 h to travel to s12 finally the density current touches 1 200 m at 9 50th and 9 28th hour according to the measured data and the simulated result the error value of the arrival time from the inflow boundary to s07 is only 0 28 h during typhoon dujuan the measured data for s24 and s20 are missing therefore the known arrival time was obtained from the simulation the travel time from 16 200 m to 9 100 m and 9 100 m to 7 700 m is 1 50 and 2 16 h respectively next the measured and simulated data can be compared from 16 200 m to 5 800 m with values of 8 5 and 8 06 h the observation is slightly faster than the simulation then the measured peak of the density current arrived at the 4 200 m marked 1 h later in comparison the simulation peak took 0 98 h ultimately the peak arrives at 10th and 9 83th hour at the 1 200 m marked the simulation model is only slower than the observation by 0 17 h during typhoon megi the simulation peak moved from 16 200 m to 9 100 m in 1 5 h and arrived at the 7 700 m marked after 3 03 h in addition the observation model took 0 47 h longer than the simulation model both the observation peak and the simulation peak took 7 h to travel from 16 200 m to 5 800 m however the simulation took slightly longer by 0 19 h after 1 and 1 29 h the observation and simulation peaks arrived at the 4 200 m mark results show that 9 50 and 9 75 h were the arrival times of the peak concentrations for the measured data and the simulated results comparing these three typhoon events the arrival time of observation and simulation for typhoon soudelor dujuan and megi were 9 50 and 9 28 h 10 and 9 83 h and 9 50 and 9 75 h respectively the maximum error value was 0 25 h for typhoon megi additionally typhoon dujuan had the minimum error of 0 17 h hence the temporal variation of the density can be reasonably described by the simulation in the first stage 4 2 horizontal and vertical concentration distribution the sediment transport distance is affected by the incoming fluid amount river bed slope and cross section width when the water contains suspended load from upstream into the wide reservoir the movement strength should be weakened and then causes the deposition the concentration of the density current will decrease with distance until reaching the front of the dam table 3 shows the comparison of peak concentrations for typhoon soudelor dujuan and megi during typhoon soudelor the measured and simulated data share the same peak concentration value 18 287 ppm at the inflow boundary the distance of each comparison point from the dam was presented in section 4 1 the measured values along the distance are 11 100 ppm at 7 700 m s20 4 500 ppm at 5 800 m s15 6 850 ppm at 4 200 m s12 and 6 387 ppm at 1 200 m s07 the simulated values are 11 255 ppm at 9 100 m s24 6 861 ppm at 7 700 m s20 7 599 ppm at 5 800 m s15 6 030 ppm at 4 200 m s12 and 5 623 ppm at 1 200 m s07 as a whole the concentration of the density current shows a decreasing trend along the downward distance the results of typhoon dujuan shows the same trend with typhoon soudelor the values of the measured data and simulated results are the same 16 177 ppm at s32 3 647 and 7 613 ppm at s15 3 112 and 6 098 ppm at s12 and 5 037 and 5 375 ppm at s07 in addition the simulated values of s24 and s20 are 9 890 and 6 404 ppm respectively the comparison between observation and simulation at s07 are close marked 5 037 and 5 375 ppm of the observation and simulation results respectively during typhoon megi the values of the measured data and simulated results at s32 are 23 200 ppm at s24 are 6 450 and 12 775 ppm at s20 are 6 562 and 7 197 ppm at s15 are 5 042 and 10 550 ppm at s12 are 6 010 and 7 691 ppm and at s07 are 7 385 and 7 141 ppm to sum up the decay rate of the observation and simulation results for typhoon soudelor dujuan and megi are 0 35 and 0 31 0 31 and 0 33 and 0 32 and 0 31 the simulation result shows a consistent and stable trend along the reservoir toward the downstream distance based on the approximate decay trend of the observation and the simulation the simulated result can be applied to calculate the horizontal spatial variation in different typhoon events of the shi men reservoir the characteristic in the reservoir is that the vertical concentration profile shows the significant variation than the shallow river therefore the vertical spatial variation has to be determined the same three typhoon events adopted to investigate it fig 5 presents the release sediment concentration of the different sluice gates in the dam face the vertical data including spillway diversion tunnel smc ppi and pro the vertical spatial variation of the suspended sediment concentration can be indicated by the high regression coefficient rating curve therefore the difference of the sediment concentration at the different elevations can be calculated by the vertical spatial regression 4 3 model performance for half hourly suspended sediment concentration forecasting to highlight the forecasting performance due to the use of the mgsvm based models performance measures of the mgsvm bpn and rbfn based models in the training and testing phases for different measured points smc and ppi are compared herein the four measures are discussed to present the forecasting performance of the different forecasting models tables 4 and 5 show all performance measures of the forecasting models in the training and testing phases as shown in table 4 even though the ce and cc values of the three models decrease with increasing forecast lead time those of mgsvm based models are obviously higher than those of bpn and rbfn based models at the measure point smc the mae values of mgsvm based models are almost lower than those of bpn and rbfn based models for 0 5 to 3 h lead time forecasting as for the measured point ppi the bpn based model significantly yields high mae values for 0 5 to 2 h lead time forecasting table 4 also shows that the csi of mgsvm based model is larger than that of bpn and rbfn based models for each lead times especially for 0 5 h lead time forecasting meaning that the hit percentage of mgsvm is significantly better than others similar results in the testing phase are also obtained in table 5 again the mgsvm based model can reasonably yield more accurate forecasting values than other models figs 6 and 7 show that the percentage of increase in ce cc and csi and the percentage of decrease in mae due to the use of mgsvm based models instead of bpn based models and rbfn based models for smc and ppi at the dam front as shown in fig 6 the ranges of percentages of increase in ce cc and csi are from 32 to 60 18 to 37 and 13 to 73 respectively due to the use of mgsvm based models instead of bpn based models those are also from 53 to 60 31 to 37 and 73 to 61 for 1 5 to 3 h lead time forecasting respectively due to the use of mgsvm based models instead of rbfn based models in addition the percentages of decrease in mae are relatively high especially for 0 5 h lead time forecasting as to the results in ppi shown in fig 7 the percentages of increase in ce and cc are relatively high for 1 h lead time forecasting 79 and 54 respectively the percentages of decrease in mae are from 119 to 10 due to the use of mgsvm based models instead of bpn based models the percentages of increase in csi are almost high due to the use of mgsvm based models obviously the mgsvm based models yield significantly high ce cc and csi values and low mae to clearly investigate the forecasting performance in the testing phase scatter plots and times series of the 0 5 to 3 h lead time forecasts of the mgsvm bpn and rbfn based models compared with the simulated concentrations of the density current model for the measured points smc and ppi in the testing phase are presented in figs 8 and 10 moreover the 0 5 to 3 h lead time forecasts of the mgsvm bpn and rbfn based models are also compared with the simulated concentrations for smc and ppi in the testing phase in figs 9 and 11 as shown in fig 8 for the smc the forecasts of the bpn based model are significantly underestimated by comparing with those of the mgsvm based model except for 0 5 and 2 5 h lead time forecasting in addition the forecasts of the rbfn based model are also obviously underestimated by comparing with those of the mgsvm based model except for 0 5 and 1 h lead time forecasting as to ppi shown in fig 10 the mgsvm based models yield similar results with the bpn and rbfn based models however the forecasts of the rbfn based model are significantly underestimated for 1 h lead time forecasting similar results are also obtained in figs 9 and 11 the results clearly indicate that the mgsvm based models have better forecasting performance in the four performance measures especially for the point smc it means that the mgsvm based model can reasonably acceptable forecasting information even though the bpn or rbfn based models can yield good forecasting performance for several lead times the forecasting performance of the mgsvm based model is definitely more consistent than other models especially in peak concentration moreover the peak errors of the employed models are occurred especially for longer lead times a reasonable explanation is that when the forecast lead time increases the correlation between output and input decreases because the data applied for longer lead times include more relatively irrelative information therefore suspended sediment concentration forecasting is a relevant challenging problem the several hours ahead information is exactly crucial and can be considered as the model input for future research over all based on the simulated suspended sediment concentration provided by the numerical model reasonably describing the physical behavior of density current flow as the input for the forecasting models the mgsvm based model is expected as a useful forecasting tool for half hourly suspended sediment concentration forecasting during typhoons 4 4 investigation of the optimal input combination for the measured points to identify the most significant input and appropriate lag lengths of input the optimal input combinations of the mgsvm based model for each lead time at the measured points a smc and b ppi are presented as fig 12 several significant features were observed in the optimal input selection firstly the inflow boundary data were sawed a representative input parameters because of the smc and ppi were used widely this trend is positive to improve the presented prediction model if the concentration of the dam face could be predicted by the upstream s32 data the reservoir management would be strived for more time to operate sluice gates the results of the smc and ppi will describe respectively below as shown in fig 12 a even though the optimal input combinations for each lead time are different the simulation of suspended sediment concentration at the cross section s32 and the lagged observation at the measure point smc were employed as the input of the mgsvm based model for 1 5 to 3 h lead time forecasting the simulated concentration at the cross section s07 were used as the input the results indicate that more information of simulated concentration along the reservoir are definitely needed for suspended sediment concentration forecasting at smc meaning that when the density current moves to the dam front it would be resisted and changed the flow direction if the outflow smaller than the inflow discharge the muddy lake would produce simultaneously and disturb the density current character the density current could be broken and the turbidity fluid entered into the upper clear water as the upstream material flows into reservoir incessantly the height of the muddy lake will rise and affect the concentration of the middle sluice gate the complicated physical mechanisms of the density current usually occur near the measured point smc as to the results at ppi shown in fig 12 b the patterns of the input s32 and the observed ppi for each lead time are similar with fig 12 a meaning that the simulated concentration resulted from the density current model at s32 and the observed concentration at ppi are obviously significant information for the forecasting model furthermore the input number of each combination for each lead time at ppi is less than that of each combination at smc representing that the forecasting model does not need too many input variables to yield reasonable accurate forecasts a reasonable explanation is that turbidity water density at ppi is high because ppi is located near the bottom of the dam the simulated concentration at s32 and the observed concentration at ppi have high correlation with the forecasted concentration because they are evidently critical input factors for suspended sediment concentration forecasting over all the physically based numerical model indeed provides high quality simulated data to the machine learning based model moreover the mgsvm based forecasting model is able to optimize the input combination and reflect the physical behaviors of suspended sediment concentration based on the simulated data along the reservoir and the measured data at the dam front 5 conclusion and future work the purpose of this paper is to provide accurate real time forecasts of half hourly suspended sediment concentration during typhoons for this purpose we propose a two stage forecasting approach integrating the density current and the machine learning models in this paper in the first stage the density current model embeds the first stage to reasonably describe the physical movement mechanism of suspended sediment concentration furthermore the simulated results based on the spatial temporal relationship were applied as the input of the machine learning based forecasting model in the second stage an actual application in the shi men reservoir is conducted to demonstrate the half hourly forecasting model performance the operation of each sluice gate at the dam front is significant to release the inflow sediment technically speaking the regular operation time is between 0 5 and 1 h in this paper the application for 0 5 to 3 h lead time forecasting was conducted to point out the accuracy and limitation of the mgsvm based models the results clearly show that the density current model verified by the measured data is able to reasonably calculate the sufficient event data as the input of the forecasting model the forecasting models have good performance to yield reasonably acceptable forecasts as well it will be helpful for effectively evaluating the variation of sediment concentration and further providing an updated operation to release the inflow sediment on the basis of the results the significant insights in future work can be concluded as 1 the proposed forecasting approach is able to further integrate reservoir operation for effectively sediment releasing during typhoons which is definitely helpful to maintain the storage capacity for reservoir sustainable development 2 the proposed approach can be further applied to investigate their physical phenomenon for the all sluice gates with different height levels at the dam front of the shi men reservoir declaration of interests none 
6541,accurate forecasting of hourly suspended sediment concentration is a critical issue for reservoir management especially during typhoon periods this research proposes a two stage forecasting approach integrating numerical and machine learning based models to provide accurate real time forecasts of half hourly suspended sediment concentration in the first stage the density current model srh2d was verified and applied by the historical typhoon events due to the lack of measured suspended sediment concentration next in the second stage the calculated results from srh2d based on the spatial temporal relation were employed as the input of the mgsvm based model finally an application in the shi men reservoir was conducted to demonstrate the forecasting performance of the proposed approach the results indicated that the calculated data from the srh2d model corresponded to the trend of measured data in spatial temporal variation moreover the proposed forecasting approach enables reasonably acceptable 0 5 to 3 h ahead forecasts of suspended sediment concentration by using the simulated data of half hourly suspended sediment concentration the accurate forecast conducted by the proposed approach is expected to be properly applied to reservoir management keywords suspended sediment concentration forecasting density current reservoir multi objective genetic algorithm support vector machine typhoon 1 introduction understanding and quantifying the dynamics of suspended sediment transport phenomenon in reservoirs and other water bodies are essential in implementing appropriate mitigation measures to prevent sediment deposition sivakumar 2002 cobaner et al 2009 in recent years the problems of the active storage and the estimated lifespan of reservoirs have been attracted much attention in the world wisser et al 2013 the reservoir sedimentation issue is regarded as the urgent subject in the current period solving the subject of reservoir deposition therefore is already a universal value nonetheless the evolution of reservoir sedimentation is an extremely complex transport mechanism in this process suspended sediment mixed with water flows into the reservoir and released to downstream river partly after typhoon events unreleased sediment would fall down and deposit on the bottom of the reservoir and affects the active reservoir storage capacity observing the operation of the most reservoirs for decades the deposition rate was confirmed to be higher than the original estimation due to climate change caused the yielded sediment increased during typhoon period the effective desiltation strategy must be formulated in order to achieve the goal of reservoir sustainable development grasping the sediment movement behavior in the reservoir area and then estimating its future movement will be the primary condition for success the high accurate prediction of suspended sediment concentration is seriously difficult because of the complexity of the physical mechanism of the density current density current flow is a particular flow pattern that happens as the specific gravity of the inflow turbidity water is greater than that of the water in the reservoir high density water dives to the bottom and flows under the relatively clean water meanwhile stratification phenomena are observed between the two fluids of different densities a conceptual model is able to represent reality due to the conceptual background of the model and also helpful for that the model was constructed as using the data out of the range babovic 2009 therefore the travel pattern of the density current flow should be grasped in the first stage by a reliable data based on a conceptual model within the field of data analytics the sufficient high quality measured data of suspended sediment concentration for machine learning based prediction models is essential however the measured data during typhoons are usually insufficient because extreme flood disaster leads to a harsh environment to interrupt the measurement of the suspended sediment concentration the construction of reliably accurate machine learning based prediction models using the insufficient measured data are relatively difficult therefore a stable and consistent method for instance numerical model should be adopted to make up for the incomplete measured data in the past decades numerous numerical models were developed to investigate the density current flow lai et al 2015 developed a 2d layer averaged model srh2d which could be used to estimate the travel velocity and the average concentration of the density current moreover srh2d has been applied in the down scale physical model of the shi men reservoir and earn the reasonable result hence srh2d which can assist in obtaining a satisfactory result of density current flow is further considered to be applied in this paper accurate prediction of suspended sediment concentration to reduce reservoir deposition for maintaining the reservoir storage capacity plays a significant role in reservoir management kişi 2004 halbe et al 2013 an attractive method for predicting suspended sediment concentration based on machine learning technique could be embedded such as neural networks nns which have been successfully used in real time forecasting for various fields even though the intrinsic structure and behavior of suspended sediment concentration is not absolutely characterized by researchers the proper behavior of the system can be predicted by the category of models including statistical approaches and nns babovic 2009 in addition nns have been gradually applied into different modeling fields and currently regarded as principal approaches for integrating various sources of information babovic 2000 nns have also been widely applied to the suspended sediment problem in the past years especially for the simulation and prediction of daily suspended sediment concentration zounemat kermani et al 2016 malik et al 2017 alizadeh et al 2017 in the past periods physical conceptual models have been combined with machine learning methods to improve forecasting or modeling of target variables babovic et al 2001 yu et al 2004 azamathullah et al 2010 ghani et al 2011 loukas and vasiliades 2014 combined the hydrological model and the artificial neural networks anns for rainfall runoff modeling procedures young and liu 2015 used physically based and artificial neural network hybrid model to model and predict rainfall runoff during typhoon events yu et al 2004 combined chaos theory and support vector machine svm with a large sample data record for 1 lead day flow prediction sannasiraj et al 2004 combined the best of a deterministic model and a stochastic model to improve the daily predictability of the tidal variation sun et al 2010 combined chaos theory and time delay based neural networks to enhance the accuracy of the tidal prediction karri et al 2013 used ensemble kalman filter enkf based data to deal with the limitation of the measurement technique and developed the forecasts result significantly humphrey et al 2016 explored a hybrid approach using the simulated soil moisture from a conceptual rainfall runoff model and a bayesian artificial neural network statistical forecasting model for monthly streamflow forecasting furthermore numerous previous studies have mostly employed ann based or neuro fuzzy models to simulate or predict daily suspended sediment concentration lohani et al 2007 agarwal et al 2009 cobaner et al 2009 rajaee et al 2009 kişi 2010 liu et al 2013 afan et al 2015 kumar et al 2016 ghose and samantaray 2018 however little application of various machine learning based models to forecast suspended sediment concentration was performed especially on half hourly suspended sediment concentration forecasting during typhoons therefore we integrate numerical and machine learning based models to overcome the lack of sufficient high quality measured data of suspended sediment concentration in this paper a density current model was established to simulate half hourly suspended sediment concentration which are consistent with the sediment transport mechanisms the simulated data were provided as the input for training and testing the machine learning based models in addition one of the most important steps for the construction procedure of machine learning based prediction models is the determination of critical input variables bowden et al 2005 lin and jhong 2015 in general all of the potential input variables are not equally informative because of the noisy or low significant relationship with the desired output bowden et al 2005 hence input selection algorithms need to be able to determine the strength of the relationship between potential model inputs and outputs and should take into account implicitly the redundancy in candidate model inputs fernando et al 2009 galelli et al 2014 more recently a mgsvm based model integrating multi objective genetic algorithm moga and svm has been successfully developed in rainfall and inundation forecasting lin et al 2013 lin and jhong 2015 jhong et al 2016 according to the results of these previous studies the mgsvm based model is not only able to determine whether each input is used but also optimize lag lengths of input variables to simultaneously consider the complicated relationship between all inputs with their determined lag lengths despite the application of various machine learning based models to forecast suspended sediment concentration little research has been performed on half hourly suspended sediment concentration forecasting especially during typhoons therefore the aforementioned reasonable justification has prompted us to employ the mgsvm based model on half hourly suspended sediment concentration forecasting during typhoons the purpose of this paper is to provide accurate real time forecasts of half hourly suspended sediment concentration during typhoons a two stage forecasting approach integrating numerical and machine learning based models is proposed in this paper in the first stage the density current model srh2d is adopted to investigate the density movement suspended sediment concentration variation along the reservoir moreover the calculated results from srh2d based on the spatial temporal relation were employed as the input of the mgsvm based model in the second stage an application in the shi men reservoir was conducted to demonstrate the forecasting performance of the proposed approach the results of density current movement forecasting model performance and the optimal input combination are further discussed the contribution of this paper is expected to provide useful information for reservoir operation 2 the proposed two stage forecasting approach in order to achieve the goal for half hourly suspended sediment concentration forecasting at the dam face a two stage approach integrating the numerical i e the density current model and machine learning based i e the mgsvm based model models is proposed in this paper the flowchart of the proposed forecasting approach is shown in fig 1 in the first stage the measured data of suspended sediment concentration inflow and outflow discharge were collected for the numerical verification by the density current flow pattern of three historical typhoon events from 2015 to 2016 then the temporal spatial relation was obtained and the application of the relation were extended to more typhoons from 2007 to 2016 in the second stage the simulated suspended sediment concentration along the reservoir were produced and the measured data of suspended sediment concentration at the dam face were used as the input of mgsvm based model then the parameters were set for the mgsvm based modeling the pareto optimal solutions on the pareto front were produced and the pareto optimal solution with the minimum input number were finally determined as the optimal input combination the detailed methodologies of the physically conceptual and machine learning based models are presented as follows 2 1 suspended sediment concentration simulation an adopted 2d layer averaged density current model srh2d was developed by lai et al 2015 the mass conservation equation and momentum equations were adopted to calculate the hydraulic phenomena then the non equilibrium sediment transport equation in the water column and the bed elevation change equation at the bed surface were based on the mass conservation law to simulate besides the erosional rate potential term may be computed by any of the traditional sediment transport equations which compute the equilibrium or capacity sediment concentration in srh2d the equation of engelund and hansen 1972 is adopted due to the success reported by lai et al 2015 for density current flow the engelund hansen equation as rewritten by hassanzadeh et al 2011 was shown in lai et al 2015 based on the above governing equations the travel time and the suspended sediment concentration can be simulated by srh2d and then the spatial temporal variation can be calculated by three verified cases the outcomes of the number of typhoon events nev would further provide to stage 2 and launch half hourly suspended sediment concentration forecasting 2 2 half hourly suspended sediment concentration forecasting in order to provide accurate forecasts of half hourly suspended sediment concentration the high quality measured data of suspended sediment concentration is critical to the forecasting model however because of the insufficiency of the precisely measured data along the reservoir the simulated data resulted from the density current model is provided as the input of the mgsvm based model which integrates multi objective genetic algorithm moga and support vector machine svm for suspended sediment concentration forecasting as shown in fig 1 in the process of the suspended sediment concentration forecasting the number of input variables lag lengths of input variables number of iterations number of populations and mutation probability were regarded as the parameters of the mgsvm based model and set for forecasting modeling according to the chromosome encoding and population generation the input combinations would be prepared for the implement of the svm algorithm more mathematical details about svm can be found in some text books vapnik 1995 1998 cristianini and shaw taylor 2000 based on the basic theory of moga the evaluation for the fitness values of chromosomes is based on objective functions the values of objective functions should be transformed properly into the fitness values a chromosome with a nonnegative high fitness value represents that is a good solution chromosomes of the moga are composed of different input variables the real valued encoding for a chromosome is used in this paper in the moga the domination concept making a comparison to determine whether one solution dominates the other or not is applied to determine pareto optimal solutions most mogas use the domination concept to find the pareto optimal solutions based on the domination concept of the moga all of the non dominated solutions which are also called pareto optimal solutions can be found hence mogas are especially appropriate to solve the multi objective nonlinear optimization problems to simplify the complexity of the mgsvm based models in the training phase two performance measures often used in evaluating hydrological models are considered as objective functions for the model training in this paper generalized pareto based scale independent fitness function gpsiff which is a simple method to determine pareto optimal solutions jhong et al 2016 is used herein after running the svm algorithm the fitness value of each chromosome in the population can be evaluated using the gpsiff that considers the objective functions for dominated and non dominated solutions in the pareto space in this paper the number of iteration is employed as the stopping condition murata et al 1996 when the specific stopping condition was satisfied mogas would be stopped the pareto optimal solutions would be found from the population and the elite set otherwise go to the selection step moreover the three operations i e selection crossover and mutation operate the population from the basics of the mogas the reason for the application of the mgsvm as the forecasting model is because of its several advantages 1 the model is able to determine if the input variable should be used or not 2 lag lengths of input variables can be optimized by the model therefore the mgsvm based model is recommended to be integrated with the physically conceptual model for suspended sediment concentration forecasting 3 application 3 1 study area and data the shi men reservoir in the middle reach of the dahan river was selected to be the research site the shi men reservoir is located between taoyuan city and hsinchu county which is the first multi functional reservoir in taiwan it was constructed from july 1956 to june 1964 and operated in the same year the location of the shi men reservoir is shown in fig 2 table 1 lists typhoon events from 2008 to 2016 used in this paper typhoons soudelor dujuan and megi were used to verify the density current model in the first stage and all typhoon events were used for the training and testing of the mgsvm based model the lifespan of the shi men reservoir has been overestimated after observation of its operation during several serious typhoon events the first huge typhoon event typhoon gloria occurred one year before the operation of the reservoir the incoming fluid carried the great amount of sediment and caused the deposition reaching 19 47 million m3 in 1996 typhoon herb accumulated about 8 67 million m3 deposition of the shi men reservoir after the typhoon herb 123 check dams located at the upstream of the shi men reservoir were almost filled with sediment the results showed that the amount of inflow sediment was much more than 8 67 million m3 the deposition became a significant threat after the 1999 chi chi earthquake due to the annual sediment yield of the upstream watershed has increased the most serious typhoon event occurred after 5 years the storage capacity was reduced by 28 91 million m3 because of the inflow sediment more than before three years later 2007 typhoon wipha attacked the shi men reservoir and declined 9 62 million m3 of storage capacity according to the field measured data the average annual rate of sediment accumulation increased from 1 71 million m3 1964 to 1998 to 2 66 million m3 1999 to 2015 the remaining capacity of the reservoir was 67 37 which means the reservoir had lost 101 86 million m3 of water storage capacity the cumulative deposition of the shi men reservoir is shown in fig 3 after several serious typhoon events the shi men reservoir had already lost 32 63 of its storage capacity according to the united geotech inc 2015 the average annual inflow sediment is 3 53 million m3 besides the effect of an upstream catchment is estimated to be less than 0 11 million m3 per year hence 3 42 million m3 of sediment will flow into the reservoir every year the tremendous amount of sediment not only affects the reservoir s capacity but also reduces its water supply function therefore to understand the sediment movement and further formulate the reservoir operation strategy the maintenance of the existing storage capacity is a key issue compared to the other reservoirs in taiwan the shi men reservoir has relatively complete observation data at present 8 observation platforms are located along the reservoir function s32 s24 s20r s20l s15 s12r s12l and s07 six measured points were located at the dam front including spillway diversion tunnel flushing tunnel permanent outlet pro power plant intake ppi and shi men main canal smc two measured points ppi and smc which are located at the lower elevation of the shi men reservoir near the reservoir bed were adopted in this paper the relative location of the above mentioned monitoring site is also shown in fig 2 the facilities at the shi men reservoir are shown in fig 4 3 2 construction of the forecasting model in this paper the 0 5 to 3 h ahead forecasts of half hourly suspended sediment concentration are desired based on the calibrated result of density current model the simulated data of suspended sediment concentration at all observation platforms are used as the input data of the mgsvm based models the measured data of measured points at the dam front are also used as the input and output of the mgsvm based models as to the parameter setting a chromosome of the moga is composed of input variables the real valued encoding is used to determine lag lengths of input variables for a chromosome herein each input variable is constructed into 3 real valued digits and the range of each input variable is from 0 to 3 meaning that the exclusion of the input variable is possible as well the numbers of iteration and population are respectively 20 and 300 the mutation probability is set as 0 1 the general form of the mgsvm based model in this paper is written as 1 c p t δ t f mgsvm s 1 t s 1 t 1 s 1 t l 1 1 s 2 t s 2 t 1 s 2 t l 2 1 s m t s m t 1 s m t l m 1 c p t c p t 1 c p t l p 1 where p and t represent the measured point and time respectively δ t is the lead time period i e 0 5 1 1 5 2 2 5 and 3 h c p t δ t is the forecasted suspended sediment concentration resulted from the mgsvm based model for the measured point p at time t δ t s m t denotes the simulated concentration resulted from the numerical model at the observation platforms located along the reservoir function at time t because 8 observation platforms s32 s24 s20r s20l s15 s12r s12l and s07 are located along the reservoir function m is equaled to 8 herein c p t denotes the observed concentration or the measured point p at time t in addition l m denotes the lag length of the simulated concentration at m th observation platform l p means the lag length of the observed concentration at the measured point p in this paper two frequently used performance measures coefficient of efficiency ce and correlation coefficient cc are used as the objective functions of the mgsvm based models for the training phase the ce is often used to assess the forecasting ability of hydrological models ce is sensitive to peak flow and cc represents the linear dependence between the two variables under consideration chadalawada and babovic 2019 if the forecasts are perfect the ce and cc values are equal to one the forms of performance measures ce and cc are described as follows 2 ce ρ 1 n ev i 1 n ev 1 t 1 n c t c t ρ 2 t 1 n c t c 2 i 3 c c ρ 1 n ev i 1 n ev t 1 n c t c c t ρ c ρ t 1 n c t c 2 t 1 n c t ρ c ρ 2 i where c t and c t ρ are respectively the simulated suspended sediment concentration resulted from the density current model and the forecasted concentration resulted from the mgsvm based models at time t n is the number of forecasts ρ means a combination of model inputs used as training data n ev is the number of typhoon events c is the average of the simulated concentration c ρ is the average of the forecasted concentration to highlight the improvement in forecasting performance due to the use of the mgsvm based model several traditional machine learning methods such as back propagation network bpn and radial basis function network rbfn were used to compare with the mgsvm based models recently several machine learning methods based on the processes that the forecasting timestep is used as an input for the next lead time for lead time forecasting have been paid more attention trafalis et al 2002 chattopadhyay 2007 choubin et al 2016 therefore the feed forward bpn and rbfn were used to compare with the mgsvm based model in this paper the general forms of the bpn and rbfn based models in this paper are written as 4 c p t 1 f bpn s 1 t s 2 t s m t c p t 5 c p t δ t f bpn s 1 t s 2 t s m t c p

performance of the mgsvm based models mean absolute error mae was selected as other two performance measures the mae is a common performance criterion used to measure the agreement between the average simulated and observed values chadalawada and babovic 2019 the smaller the mae value the better the model performance the form of mae is described as follows 8 mae 1 n ev i 1 n ev 1 n t 1 n c t c t i in addition the critical success index csi jolliffe et al 2012 wilks 2011 was adopted to evaluate the forecast accuracy of the three models in this paper the evaluative criteria are the error percentage of the difference between the observation and the forecasting value by time series if the error percentage is lower than 10 it can determine as hit or when it higher than 10 it will seem as miss the equation of critical success index is shown as below 9 csi c h c h c m 100 where c h is the number of hit for each lead time c m is the number of miss for each lead time in general the collected events are often separated into training and testing parts for the development of nn based models jhong et al 2017 the architectures and the weights of nn based models are respectively determined and adjusted using training data then the performance of the trained nn based models is tested by the testing data that are not used in the training step nevertheless different selections of training and testing data usually yield different results and sometimes cause different conclusions jhong et al 2016 2017 in order to prevent such a problem cross validations are conducted to evaluate the model performance each single typhoon event was used as a testing event to test the nn based models in turn and the remaining events are used as training events it should be noted that 2013 typhoon soulik yielded the maximum suspended sediment concentration so the event should be used as training data conclusions are then drawn on the basis of the overall performance for the 10 events 4 results and discussion 4 1 density current movement the travel velocity of the density current is a mentioned subject in reservoir management because of the appropriate hydraulic desilting timing relies on the accuracy of the arrival time therefore accurate estimation of the arrival time of the density current can help to improve the sediment release efficiency and save water resources table 2 showed the comparison of the arrival time of typhoon soudelor dujuan and megi along the reservoir in the shi men reservoir s32 at the location of 16 200 m is defined to the inflow boundary in addition s24 is located at 9 100 m s20 is located at 7 700 m s15 is located at 5 800 m s12 is located at 4 200 m and s07 is located at 1 200 m these sections were adopted to evaluate the difference between measured and simulated data the measured data show that the peak concentration of typhoon soudelor took about 9 5 h to arrive at s07 from s32 the simulation is very close to the observation with a value of 9 28 h in addition the comparison of the measured and simulated results between each section still showed a fit tendency the times required to travel from 16 200 m to 7 700 m were recorded as 3 and 2 75 h by observation and simulation and then the area is wide from 7 700 m to 5 800 m and caused the travel pattern of the density current slows down the travel time was 3 h for the measured data and 3 39 h for the simulated results after passing through the wider area the density current goes through a narrow location the travel velocity increases in speed up the density current the density current takes 1 50 and 1 15 h to travel to s12 finally the density current touches 1 200 m at 9 50th and 9 28th hour according to the measured data and the simulated result the error value of the arrival time from the inflow boundary to s07 is only 0 28 h during typhoon dujuan the measured data for s24 and s20 are missing therefore the known arrival time was obtained from the simulation the travel time from 16 200 m to 9 100 m and 9 100 m to 7 700 m is 1 50 and 2 16 h respectively next the measured and simulated data can be compared from 16 200 m to 5 800 m with values of 8 5 and 8 06 h the observation is slightly faster than the simulation then the measured peak of the density current arrived at the 4 200 m marked 1 h later in comparison the simulation peak took 0 98 h ultimately the peak arrives at 10th and 9 83th hour at the 1 200 m marked the simulation model is only slower than the observation by 0 17 h during typhoon megi the simulation peak moved from 16 200 m to 9 100 m in 1 5 h and arrived at the 7 700 m marked after 3 03 h in addition the observation model took 0 47 h longer than the simulation model both the observation peak and the simulation peak took 7 h to travel from 16 200 m to 5 800 m however the simulation took slightly longer by 0 19 h after 1 and 1 29 h the observation and simulation peaks arrived at the 4 200 m mark results show that 9 50 and 9 75 h were the arrival times of the peak concentrations for the measured data and the simulated results comparing these three typhoon events the arrival time of observation and simulation for typhoon soudelor dujuan and megi were 9 50 and 9 28 h 10 and 9 83 h and 9 50 and 9 75 h respectively the maximum error value was 0 25 h for typhoon megi additionally typhoon dujuan had the minimum error of 0 17 h hence the temporal variation of the density can be reasonably described by the simulation in the first stage 4 2 horizontal and vertical concentration distribution the sediment transport distance is affected by the incoming fluid amount river bed slope and cross section width when the water contains suspended load from upstream into the wide reservoir the movement strength should be weakened and then causes the deposition the concentration of the density current will decrease with distance until reaching the front of the dam table 3 shows the comparison of peak concentrations for typhoon soudelor dujuan and megi during typhoon soudelor the measured and simulated data share the same peak concentration value 18 287 ppm at the inflow boundary the distance of each comparison point from the dam was presented in section 4 1 the measured values along the distance are 11 100 ppm at 7 700 m s20 4 500 ppm at 5 800 m s15 6 850 ppm at 4 200 m s12 and 6 387 ppm at 1 200 m s07 the simulated values are 11 255 ppm at 9 100 m s24 6 861 ppm at 7 700 m s20 7 599 ppm at 5 800 m s15 6 030 ppm at 4 200 m s12 and 5 623 ppm at 1 200 m s07 as a whole the concentration of the density current shows a decreasing trend along the downward distance the results of typhoon dujuan shows the same trend with typhoon soudelor the values of the measured data and simulated results are the same 16 177 ppm at s32 3 647 and 7 613 ppm at s15 3 112 and 6 098 ppm at s12 and 5 037 and 5 375 ppm at s07 in addition the simulated values of s24 and s20 are 9 890 and 6 404 ppm respectively the comparison between observation and simulation at s07 are close marked 5 037 and 5 375 ppm of the observation and simulation results respectively during typhoon megi the values of the measured data and simulated results at s32 are 23 200 ppm at s24 are 6 450 and 12 775 ppm at s20 are 6 562 and 7 197 ppm at s15 are 5 042 and 10 550 ppm at s12 are 6 010 and 7 691 ppm and at s07 are 7 385 and 7 141 ppm to sum up the decay rate of the observation and simulation results for typhoon soudelor dujuan and megi are 0 35 and 0 31 0 31 and 0 33 and 0 32 and 0 31 the simulation result shows a consistent and stable trend along the reservoir toward the downstream distance based on the approximate decay trend of the observation and the simulation the simulated result can be applied to calculate the horizontal spatial variation in different typhoon events of the shi men reservoir the characteristic in the reservoir is that the vertical concentration profile shows the significant variation than the shallow river therefore the vertical spatial variation has to be determined the same three typhoon events adopted to investigate it fig 5 presents the release sediment concentration of the different sluice gates in the dam face the vertical data including spillway diversion tunnel smc ppi and pro the vertical spatial variation of the suspended sediment concentration can be indicated by the high regression coefficient rating curve therefore the difference of the sediment concentration at the different elevations can be calculated by the vertical spatial regression 4 3 model performance for half hourly suspended sediment concentration forecasting to highlight the forecasting performance due to the use of the mgsvm based models performance measures of the mgsvm bpn and rbfn based models in the training and testing phases for different measured points smc and ppi are compared herein the four measures are discussed to present the forecasting performance of the different forecasting models tables 4 and 5 show all performance measures of the forecasting models in the training and testing phases as shown in table 4 even though the ce and cc values of the three models decrease with increasing forecast lead time those of mgsvm based models are obviously higher than those of bpn and rbfn based models at the measure point smc the mae values of mgsvm based models are almost lower than those of bpn and rbfn based models for 0 5 to 3 h lead time forecasting as for the measured point ppi the bpn based model significantly yields high mae values for 0 5 to 2 h lead time forecasting table 4 also shows that the csi of mgsvm based model is larger than that of bpn and rbfn based models for each lead times especially for 0 5 h lead time forecasting meaning that the hit percentage of mgsvm is significantly better than others similar results in the testing phase are also obtained in table 5 again the mgsvm based model can reasonably yield more accurate forecasting values than other models figs 6 and 7 show that the percentage of increase in ce cc and csi and the percentage of decrease in mae due to the use of mgsvm based models instead of bpn based models and rbfn based models for smc and ppi at the dam front as shown in fig 6 the ranges of percentages of increase in ce cc and csi are from 32 to 60 18 to 37 and 13 to 73 respectively due to the use of mgsvm based models instead of bpn based models those are also from 53 to 60 31 to 37 and 73 to 61 for 1 5 to 3 h lead time forecasting respectively due to the use of mgsvm based models instead of rbfn based models in addition the percentages of decrease in mae are relatively high especially for 0 5 h lead time forecasting as to the results in ppi shown in fig 7 the percentages of increase in ce and cc are relatively high for 1 h lead time forecasting 79 and 54 respectively the percentages of decrease in mae are from 119 to 10 due to the use of mgsvm based models instead of bpn based models the percentages of increase in csi are almost high due to the use of mgsvm based models obviously the mgsvm based models yield significantly high ce cc and csi values and low mae to clearly investigate the forecasting performance in the testing phase scatter plots and times series of the 0 5 to 3 h lead time forecasts of the mgsvm bpn and rbfn based models compared with the simulated concentrations of the density current model for the measured points smc and ppi in the testing phase are presented in figs 8 and 10 moreover the 0 5 to 3 h lead time forecasts of the mgsvm bpn and rbfn based models are also compared with the simulated concentrations for smc and ppi in the testing phase in figs 9 and 11 as shown in fig 8 for the smc the forecasts of the bpn based model are significantly underestimated by comparing with those of the mgsvm based model except for 0 5 and 2 5 h lead time forecasting in addition the forecasts of the rbfn based model are also obviously underestimated by comparing with those of the mgsvm based model except for 0 5 and 1 h lead time forecasting as to ppi shown in fig 10 the mgsvm based models yield similar results with the bpn and rbfn based models however the forecasts of the rbfn based model are significantly underestimated for 1 h lead time forecasting similar results are also obtained in figs 9 and 11 the results clearly indicate that the mgsvm based models have better forecasting performance in the four performance measures especially for the point smc it means that the mgsvm based model can reasonably acceptable forecasting information even though the bpn or rbfn based models can yield good forecasting performance for several lead times the forecasting performance of the mgsvm based model is definitely more consistent than other models especially in peak concentration moreover the peak errors of the employed models are occurred especially for longer lead times a reasonable explanation is that when the forecast lead time increases the correlation between output and input decreases because the data applied for longer lead times include more relatively irrelative information therefore suspended sediment concentration forecasting is a relevant challenging problem the several hours ahead information is exactly crucial and can be considered as the model input for future research over all based on the simulated suspended sediment concentration provided by the numerical model reasonably describing the physical behavior of density current flow as the input for the forecasting models the mgsvm based model is expected as a useful forecasting tool for half hourly suspended sediment concentration forecasting during typhoons 4 4 investigation of the optimal input combination for the measured points to identify the most significant input and appropriate lag lengths of input the optimal input combinations of the mgsvm based model for each lead time at the measured points a smc and b ppi are presented as fig 12 several significant features were observed in the optimal input selection firstly the inflow boundary data were sawed a representative input parameters because of the smc and ppi were used widely this trend is positive to improve the presented prediction model if the concentration of the dam face could be predicted by the upstream s32 data the reservoir management would be strived for more time to operate sluice gates the results of the smc and ppi will describe respectively below as shown in fig 12 a even though the optimal input combinations for each lead time are different the simulation of suspended sediment concentration at the cross section s32 and the lagged observation at the measure point smc were employed as the input of the mgsvm based model for 1 5 to 3 h lead time forecasting the simulated concentration at the cross section s07 were used as the input the results indicate that more information of simulated concentration along the reservoir are definitely needed for suspended sediment concentration forecasting at smc meaning that when the density current moves to the dam front it would be resisted and changed the flow direction if the outflow smaller than the inflow discharge the muddy lake would produce simultaneously and disturb the density current character the density current could be broken and the turbidity fluid entered into the upper clear water as the upstream material flows into reservoir incessantly the height of the muddy lake will rise and affect the concentration of the middle sluice gate the complicated physical mechanisms of the density current usually occur near the measured point smc as to the results at ppi shown in fig 12 b the patterns of the input s32 and the observed ppi for each lead time are similar with fig 12 a meaning that the simulated concentration resulted from the density current model at s32 and the observed concentration at ppi are obviously significant information for the forecasting model furthermore the input number of each combination for each lead time at ppi is less than that of each combination at smc representing that the forecasting model does not need too many input variables to yield reasonable accurate forecasts a reasonable explanation is that turbidity water density at ppi is high because ppi is located near the bottom of the dam the simulated concentration at s32 and the observed concentration at ppi have high correlation with the forecasted concentration because they are evidently critical input factors for suspended sediment concentration forecasting over all the physically based numerical model indeed provides high quality simulated data to the machine learning based model moreover the mgsvm based forecasting model is able to optimize the input combination and reflect the physical behaviors of suspended sediment concentration based on the simulated data along the reservoir and the measured data at the dam front 5 conclusion and future work the purpose of this paper is to provide accurate real time forecasts of half hourly suspended sediment concentration during typhoons for this purpose we propose a two stage forecasting approach integrating the density current and the machine learning models in this paper in the first stage the density current model embeds the first stage to reasonably describe the physical movement mechanism of suspended sediment concentration furthermore the simulated results based on the spatial temporal relationship were applied as the input of the machine learning based forecasting model in the second stage an actual application in the shi men reservoir is conducted to demonstrate the half hourly forecasting model performance the operation of each sluice gate at the dam front is significant to release the inflow sediment technically speaking the regular operation time is between 0 5 and 1 h in this paper the application for 0 5 to 3 h lead time forecasting was conducted to point out the accuracy and limitation of the mgsvm based models the results clearly show that the density current model verified by the measured data is able to reasonably calculate the sufficient event data as the input of the forecasting model the forecasting models have good performance to yield reasonably acceptable forecasts as well it will be helpful for effectively evaluating the variation of sediment concentration and further providing an updated operation to release the inflow sediment on the basis of the results the significant insights in future work can be concluded as 1 the proposed forecasting approach is able to further integrate reservoir operation for effectively sediment releasing during typhoons which is definitely helpful to maintain the storage capacity for reservoir sustainable development 2 the proposed approach can be further applied to investigate their physical phenomenon for the all sluice gates with different height levels at the dam front of the shi men reservoir declaration of interests none 
6542,the discharge of fecal indicator bacteria into surface water sources poses treatment challenges to drinking water utilities changes in the discharge regimes of streams resulting from extreme precipitation associated with climate change can exacerbate these challenges the catchments of many surface water sources depended upon by water treatment plants are ungauged thus making it difficult to predict the impacts of climate change on the microbial quality of such water sources in this study a hydrological model is implemented to assess the impact of local climate projections on flow regimes and e coli discharge in the ungauged catchment of the drinking water source for the city of ålesund in norway we performed separate sensitivity analysis for flow and e coli and assessed the variations in patterns of flow and e coli concentrations in the streams in future using adjusted meteorological data the calibrated flow showed good agreement with the observed data but the e coli model yielded lower performance indices the results indicate that interception of precipitation by forest cover and soil organic carbon content mostly control flow generation in the catchments and the variations in the concentrations of e coli were more sensitive to instream sediment processes flow levels in the streams would remain the same in 2045 and 2075 peak flows that currently occur in spring and autumn months may respectively shift back to winter and summer months high concentrations of e coli currently observed in summer in the streams may be lower in future but the concentrations may be high at the start of autumn seasons the results have management implications for watersheds and water utilities mostly in temperate climate regions keywords hydrological model climate change streamflow flow patterns e coli drinking water source 1 introduction climate and weather conditions practically affect every aspect of the environment and the intensities of primary weather variables such as precipitation and temperature are likely to increase in the 21st century due to climate change ipcc 2014 the norwegian climate has become warmer and precipitation has increased by 20 over the past 100 years current climate projections in norway indicate that precipitation may rise by 5 30 while temperature is expected to increase by between 2 3 c and 4 6 c norwegian ministry of climate and environment 2014 these projected changes in climatic variables are expected to impact on the quality and quantity of surface water sources that account for more than 90 of the country s drinking water supply bates et al 2008 brown et al 2013 norwegian ministry of climate and environment 2014 climate change related variations in air temperature and hydrological regimes of surface water sources can significantly cause deteriorations in the quality of water variations in precipitation may increase or decrease the concentrations of microorganisms in receiving surface waterbodies through increased runoffs sediment transport and resuspension in streams hofstra 2011 aragonés et al 2016 lucas et al 2014 observed trends in the deterioration of drinking water quality under changing climate can increase public health risk delpla et al 2009 in addition climate change is expected to vary the availability variability and seasonality of discharge in rivers whitehead et al 2015 affect the incidence of waterborne pathogens and pose greater management problems in the future patz and hahn 2013 accordingly there is a growing need for investigating potential changes in hydrological extremes of surface waterbodies stahl et al 2012 and predicting faecal indicator bacteria fib concentrations fluxes and loads in a variety of waterbodies to provide the necessary policy framework and guidelines to address water quality challenges in the future cho et al 2016 the severity of climate impacts on the quality of surface water bodies does not only depend on the magnitude of the expected changes in climate variables but also developments in future land use in addition the negative impacts of climate change on the quality of raw water sources can be reduced if water utilities have the capacities to plan and implement effective adaptation strategies within the catchments of their raw water sources that take into account the effects of climate change the development of such strategies require an integrated approach that links climate change projections to hydrological processes within the catchments of raw water sources for water utilities that mainly rely on surface water sources it is essential to evaluate and understand the imminent management challenges and potential health risks that may be associated with variabilities in the pattern of microbial discharge in the future due to climate change securing long term safety of the drinking water source is necessary for sustainable management of drinking water supply systems investigating the impacts of climate change on hydrological flow and water quality regimes of raw water sources usually involve the application of hydrological models using historical climate data and projected data obtained by adjusting historical observations based on assumed future climate scenarios wilby and harris 2006 for this a number of studies have examined the effects of climate change on flow regimes at catchment scales graham et al 2007 prudhomme davies 2009 vansteenkiste et al 2013 meresa et al 2017 in the work of meresa et al 2017 in which the trends in selected hydro climatic indices in norwegian and polish catchments were investigated the authors observed that periods of increased precipitation in catchments with rainfall driven floods were followed by increased flow levels with strong seasonal changes for catchments with snow driven flood regimes however decreases in annual maximum flows were observed over the studied period meresa et al 2017 moreover results of a study that investigated hydrological regimes under future climatic conditions in central norway revealed that climate change would strongly influence stream flow with more evenly distributed flow volumes across seasons and significant reduction in the amount of snow cover hiriyanna rao ravindra 2017 in respect of modeling the discharge of fib into surface water the focus of many studies has been on improving the understanding of the effects of hydrological processes on their fate and transport in the environment jonsson and agerberg 2015 niazi et al 2015 as well as the effects of in stream processes kim et al 2017 to date few studies have linked the discharge of faecal indicator organisms fib to climate induced changes to flow patterns that may occur in future liu and chan 2015 to our knowledge no study has been undertaken in scandinavia to account for the effects of climate change on the hydrological response and water quality e coli concentrations within the catchments of drinking water sources further although water supply systems in norway have improved over the last 20 30 years most of the catchments of drinking water sources are ungauged the ungauged nature of the catchments inhibits the development of effective strategies for water safety planning especially on the impact of climate change on hydrological processes and water quality within the catchments there are existing approaches involving the transfer of hydrological parameters in catchments that share common spatial characteristics to help address this challenge in this study hydrological model using existing approaches is implemented to assess the impact of local climate projections on flow regimes and e coli discharge in the ungauged catchment of the drinking water source for the city of ålesund in norway the approach used in this study is expected to be replicated for other ungauged catchments in norway particularly those serving drinking water treatment plants and are potentially vulnerable to climate change in addition the results of the study are expected to contribute to improvement in understanding of potential impact of climate change on the quality of surface water drinking water sources in norway 2 materials and methods 2 1 brusdalsvatnet lake and catchment the streams modelled in this study discharge into the brusdalsvatnet lake which is located within the inland of oksenøya in the møre and romsdal county between ålesund and skodje municipalities in the west coast of norway fig 1 the west coast of norway is a mountainous and densely forested region that receives significant amount of rainfall throughout the four seasons of the year though peak rainfalls occur mostly in spring march may and autumn september november brusdalsvatnet lake provides drinking water to the 50 000 inhabitants of the city of ålesund and neighbouring sula municipality the lake has a surface area of approximately 7 21 km2 with a catchment area of approximately 28 1 km2 the lake has a mean surface elevation of 26 m above sea level the altitude of the catchment therefore varies from 26 m lake surface to 559 m in the southern and southeastern sections of the catchment the mean elevation in the northern side of the lake is approximately 200 m the deepest section of the lake is 94 m located at the central part of its longitudinal section the drinking water treatment plant draws 55 000 cubic meters of water daily at a depth of 35 m from the southwestern section of the lake the northwestern and southwestern sections of the lake catchment are sparsely populated with settlements while the other sections are uninhabited with little anthropogenic activities among the tributaries of the lake are two rivers arsetelva and vasstrandelva which are located on the southern side and two major streams slettebakk and brusdalen fig 1c results from an ongoing water quality survey in these tributaries show that the two streams slettebakk and brusdalen discharge very high concentrations of e coli 551 1160 cfu 100 ml into the lake compared to average concentrations of 11 cfu 100 ml observed in the other major tributaries of the lake thus this study focused on modeling water flow and e coli discharges from these streams fig 1d e the gauged catchment engesetdalsvatnet lake from which discharge and hydrological model parameters were transferred to the target catchment is shown in fig 1b comparison of the spatial and meteorological characteristics of the donor and target catchments are further presented in table 1 2 2 regionalization of flow data from gauged to ungauged catchment the target catchment in this study brusdalsvatnet lake is currently not equipped with gauging stations accordingly obtaining estimates of the discharge into the streams in this catchment required the use of regionalization usually catchments that are within the same climate region and with similar characteristics such as topography soil type land use precipitation and temperature have similar hydrological behavior hydrological model parameters for such ungauged catchments can be estimated by regionalization bárdossy 2007 this involves transferring the hydrological parameters of the gauged catchment onto the ungauged methods applied in such transformations include area ratio transformation regression bastola et al 2008 physical similarity mcintyre et al 2005 spatial proximity merz and blöshla 2004 or more advanced methods such as kriging parajka et al 2005 and those based on satellite radar altimetry observations sun et al 2012 in this study we applied the area ratio method to transfer measured flow data from the donor catchment to our target catchment the hydrological model was first calibrated for the donor catchment and the parameters applied to the target finally the transferred flow was used for comparison with the estimated flows in the target streams the characteristics of the donor and target catchments in this study are shown in table 1 in this table rainfall and runoff are presented in units of average depth of water over the drainage basins per year mm year it can be seen in table 1 that runoff in the donor catchment 1732 mm year is higher than the annual mean rainfall in the catchment 1704 mm year except for the characteristics of precipitation in the catchment such as type rainfall and snow intensity duration distribution and antecedent precipitation other factors can influence the amount of runoff generated these include watershed characteristics such as size shape or form factor altitude slope land use and depressions in addition the donor catchment is in a higher altitude where storage of snow occurs for a longer period in the year potentially contributing to the higher runoff 2 3 spatial and geomorphological characteristics of catchment spatial data needed to specify the catchment attributes included land use and soil types digital maps for land use was obtained from the forest and landscape services unit of the norwegian institute for bioeconomy nibio while the norwegian geological survey ngu provided data for soil and sediment types in the catchments it can be seen from table 1 that the annual estimates of the precipitation in the donor catchment is significantly lower approximately 15 than in the target catchments despite the relatively larger size of the former relative to the donor catchments the target catchment is located closer to the coast the coastal areas in the region generally receive higher rainfall than the inland areas possibly due to interception of the clouds by the mountains in the area in addition the donor catchment is composed of approximately 67 forest while the slettebakk and brusdalen catchments target are respectively comprise of 95 and 84 forest cover this relatively larger proportion of forest canopies in the target catchments can substantially favor the amount of precipitation in the catchment despite the relatively larger size of the donor catchment the differences in the annual runoff is approximately 38 compared to the target catchment this may be caused by differences in other watershed characteristics as mentioned in section 2 2 of this study subsequently some differences in the parameters that control runoff generation in the two catchments may be expected in the hydrological model potentially affecting the model predictions for this reason additional calibration was performed for the target catchment for use in predicting the future runoff as explained in section 2 7 4 of this study as shown in table 1 the slettebakk and brusdalen streams modelled in this study are relatively small with channel lengths of 0 5 km and 1 km respectively due to the steep topography of the catchment the widths of the channels vary significantly and the widest sections of the two streams slettebakk and brusdalen are approximately 1 m and 1 5 m respectively for in addition the base flow in both streams is 0 01 l s although there are no specific data on sediment size distributions in the streams average concentrations of suspended sediments in streams located in the study region west coast of the norway have been reported to range from 13 mg l to 24 mg l bechmann et al 2008 while no specific farming activity exists in the slettebakk stream catchment farm animals including sheep and horses are located in the brusdalen sub catchment similarly the dominant soil types in the catchments are podzols spodosols and moraine both of which are characterized by high humus content and or peat cover and are freely drained the proportions in the donor catchment are podzols cover 53 and moraine soil rocks and sediments 46 while target catchments of the streams are both composed of 100 podzols 2 4 e coli input and calibration data biweekly water sampling and e coli analysis were carried out from the two streams slettebakk and brusdalen in two periods in 2017 from march to may 2017 and from mid august to december 2017 a total of 14 samples were collected in sterile 250 ml bottles e coli analysis was performed using membrane filtration mf method the mf method involved filtration of 100 ml of water samples through sterile single packed microporous membranes 47 mm diameter 0 45 0 02 µm pore size with grid the membranes were transferred with sterile tweezers on to coliform chromogenic agar cca media iso 9308 1 2000 for e coli cultivation at 37 c for 24 h the observed e coli cfu 100 ml were used to validate the bacteria model for the two streams in the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 arnold et al 2012 typical concentrations of e coli from domestic and wild animal manure horses sheep and deer that dominate the stream sub catchments needed as inputs to the swat model were based on values published in a report of the norwegian institute for water research niva berge et al 2011 according to the report average concentrations of e coli per 23 kg faeces of a horse per day is 5 109 cfu and can vary from 107 to 1011 cfu the corresponding average value for sheep is 1 1010 cfu with variation of 108 1011 and 2 108 cfu for deer there are stables with 10 horses in the brusdalen stream sub catchment but the actual number of sheep in the farm located within the sub catchment was not ascertained from the farmer during our regular sampling exercise we counted 20 sheep in the area close to the stream further visual inspection of the location during sampling indicated that the horse stables and the sheep nearby the stream will contribute to faecal contamination for the slettebakk stream sub catchment potential population of deer was obtained from the ålesund local hunting group who reported 40 individuals seen within 33 days over a wider area which comprises the sub catchment based on this information and the concentrations published in the niva report the daily loadings of e coli in dry animal manure into the streams were set as 7 5 108 cfu g and 2 108 cfu g respectively for the brusdalen and slettebakk sub catchments 2 5 climate data and bias correction except for catchment characteristics hydrological processes in catchments are mainly driven by climatic variables these include precipitation air temperature as well as shortwave and longwave solar radiations in this study daily precipitation mm day minimum and maximum temperature c were obtained from six weather stations fig 1 the data constituting daily measurements from each of the stations from 2010 to 2017 was taken from an online database provided by the norwegian water resources and energy directorate nve the weather stations include vigra lat 62 5617 long 6 115 hildre lat 62 6017 long 6 3187 ålesund iv lat 62 4703 long 6 2108 ørskog lat 62 4775 long 6 8167 brusdalsvatn ii lat 62 4654 long 6 4013 and emblem lat 62 4317 long 6 4325 the elevations of the weather stations ranged from 1 m to 33 m above sea level missing data points occurring in records were estimated using linear interpolation daily averages were calculated from the six weather stations and used as inputs for the hydrological model the soil and water analysis tool swat program used for the modelling in this study simulated other relevant weather parameters including solar radiation wind speed and humidity in addition the program calculated potential evapotranspiration using the penman monteith equation to simulate the flows and e coli concentrations in the streams for future scenarios we used air temperature and precipitation data from the representative concentration pathways rcp 8 5 climate models for the møre and romsdal region of norway the rcp8 5 uses three scenarios for emissions of greenhouse gases and estimates climate change for up to 2100 the model uses the period 1971 2000 as the base year and estimates climate change for up to year 2100 bias correction of the climate data was carried out using change factor method arnell 1996 hijmans et al 2005 mean seasonal outputs of the rcp 8 5 model were taken from the norwegian climate service center and the differences between the current values 2010 2017 and future projections 2045 and 2075 were calculated thus to adjust the precipitation data we calculated the ratios between the rcp 8 5 simulations for future and current climate the seasonal ratios were multiplied by the historical time series to obtain daily precipitation for 2045 and 2075 for air temperature the change factors were added to the historical data based on median projections for the four major seasons in the region the calculated change factors for 2045 and 2075 are shown in table 2 2 6 hydrological model setup and input parameters swat was used for the hydrological model swat is a physically based and spatially distributed hydrological model designed for simulating water flow sediments and contaminant transport within ungauged catchments arnold et al 1998 arnold et al 2012 in swat catchments are partitioned into sub basins and hydrological response units hrus which are lumped land areas within the sub basin composed of specific land use soil type topographic characteristics and management interventions that together describe the spatial heterogeneity of the catchment for each hru key hydrological parameters such as evapotranspiration runoff sediment yield and contaminant loads are simulated on daily monthly or annual time steps setting up the model requires various spatial data inputs organized into climate hrus ponds wetlands groundwater and the main channel reach which drains the sub basin the main input data are digital elevation model dem land use map soil map and meteorological data the swat simulates the hydrology of a watershed using two stages the land phase which controls the amount of water sediment and contaminant loadings to the main channel and the routing phase which describes the movement of the water and associated loads to the channel outlet this entire hydrologic cycle simulated in swat is based on the water balance equation expressed as 1 sw t sw 0 i 1 t r day q surf e a w seep q gw where sw 0 a n d s w t are the initial and final water content of the soil respectively on day i mm h2o t is the time days r day is the amount of input precipitation on day i mm h2o q surf and q gw are respectively the amounts of surface runoff and return flow to groundwater on day i e a is amount of evapotranspiration and w seep is the quantity of water that enters the vadose zone from the soil on day i thus the total runoff for day i comprises routed response from each hru the model predicts runoff for each hru in the watershed resulting in higher accuracy in estimating the hydrological response of the watershed in this study we used the arc swat version 2012 which is an extension in arcgis to obtain the hydrological parameters of the donor catchment engesetdalsvatnet lake the engesetdalsvatnet lake catchment was discretized into 29 hrus with 4 slope classes 0 15 15 30 30 50 and 50 and simulated on daily time steps between 2013 and 2017 the slettebakk and brusdalen watersheds were respectively divided into 21 and 26 sub basins with four slope classes for both the input meteorological data actually begins from january 2010 to december 2017 and the first three years 2010 2012 was used as a warm up period 2 7 modelling e coli concentrations in streams 2 7 1 bacteria wash off and transport in the swat model e coli loading within the target catchments were introduced into hrus in the form of dry manure from the animals within the catchments further transport and die off of e coli in the soil surface layer top 10 mm and in the streams were governed by mass transport and die off regrowth models neitsch et al 2011 for a given precipitation event in a given day in the catchment the fraction of e coli cfu m2 washed off from plant foliage onto the soil bact wsh is calculated using 2 bact wsh fr wsh bact fol where fr wsh is the wash off fraction and bact fol is the amount attached to the foliage this wash off fraction is a function of plant morphology e coli characteristics and the timing and intensity of the rainfall event in the model e coli is assumed to remain in solution in the soil surface layer that interacts with surface runoff the net change in e coli loading in the surface soil for day i δ s u r f a c e bact can be described as niazi et al 2015

net change in bacteria in the stream δ s t r e a m bact is governed by 4 δ s t r e a m bact bact inflow bact runoff bact direct i n p u t s bact resuspension bact sed bact die bact outflow where bact inflow is the initial concentration of e coli on day i bact direct i n p u t s is the e coli concentration from direct deposition from sources such as wildlife bact resuspension is the e coli

the other input parameters are as defined in eq 3 2 7 2 swat sediment module transport of sediments in swat is composed of landscape and channel parts daily sediment yield in the landscape component

die off and regrowth using first order decay the fate and transport of e coli from the manure applications soil and soil water soil adsorption and runoff partition were modelled using the following equations sadeghi arnold 2002 7a bact fol i bact fol i 1 x exp μ fol n e t bact min 7b bact sol i bact sol i 1 x exp μ sol n e t bact min 7c bact sorb i bact sorb i 1 x exp μ sorb n e t bact min where

off regrowth in these pools are accounted for by calculating the net rate constants μ net 20 for each process at 20 c and adjusted for temperature using 8 μ net 20 μ die 20 μ grw 20 9 μ net μ net 20 x

respectively cfu 100 ml and wdprch day 1 is the die off rate constant for e coli in the streams 2 7 4 calibration and validation of flow and e coli concentrations in the streams first manual calibration of daily flow at the monitoring outlet of the donor catchment was carried out in swat from 2013 to 2017 using the preceding three years 2010 2012 as model warmup period large number of model parameters present in the swat complicates the manual calibration thus an automatic calibration and sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the most important parameters that control the discharge level in the catchment this was achieved using the sequential uncertainty fitting tool sufi2 in the swat calibration and uncertainty program swat cup abbaspour 2007 abbaspour et al 2007 the fitted values of the most sensitive parameters were subsequently applied to the ungauged catchments of the drinking water source brusdalsvatnet lake to simulate daily flow in the two streams slettebakk and brusdalen in swat from 2013 to 2015 to evaluate the uncertainties and sensitivities of the model parameters in the target catchments we performed additional calibrations in swat cup using the flow data transferred from the donor catchment after the flow simulations e coli concentrations in the streams were estimated using the bacteria module in swat validation of the simulated flow in the streams were performed in swat cup using the fitted parameters and transferred data for 2016 and 2017 in a single model run the program was also used to validate the e coli models with the concentrations observed in the streams in 2017 and to determine the parameters that were most sensitive to the concentrations of e coli finally climate scenarios for flow and e coli were simulated for the two streams using the calibrated parameters and the adjusted meteorological data 2 7 5 model uncertainty and sensitivity analysis uncertainties in the estimated flow and e coli concentrations in the streams were evaluated using the sufi2 procedure in the swat cup program using initial ranges of parameters taken the sufi2 procedure caries out a number of specified iterations until the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu and the average distance between the 2 5th and 97 5th percentiles is smaller than the standard deviation of the measured data the parameter combinations within the parameter ranges are used to find the best parameter ranges that yield the best fit abbaspour 2007 the algorithm also calculates two statistics p factor which indicates the percentage of the observed data enveloped by the model results and the r factor which shows the thickness of the 95ppu envelop these statistics are used to quantify the fit between simulation results and generally larger values considered more efficient abbaspour 2007 other hydrological model efficiency indices such as the nash sutcliff efficiency ns and the coefficient of determination r2 are calculated by the algorithm in this study the ns objective function was used as the objective function for comparing the simulated and observed daily flows further the algorithm determines parameter sensitivity by regressing the latin hypercube generated parameters against the values of a chosen objective function a t test is then used to evaluate the relative significance of each parameter more sensitive parameters have larger absolute values of the t statistic in this study the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis for flow and e coli concentrations each involved one at a time option for visual inspection of the effect of each parameter and the global sensitivity analysis for ranking the parameters based on their t statistics and p values based on the t statistics we ranked the parameters from 1 most sensitive to n least sensitive 3 results and discussion 3 1 stream flow and parametrization the ranges fitted values and the sensitivity ranks of the 25 hydrological parameters calibrated in the donor and target catchments are summarized in table 3 the difference between some of the parameters in the two catchments donor and target may reflect disparities in watershed characteristics such as land use and altitude that are local to each catchment comparison of the parameters in the target catchment with those obtained in the calibration of the donor catchment revealed no distinct disparities in the sensitivities this indicates that both catchments have similar hydrological responses the results illustrates that the canopy storage canmx and plant uptake compensation factor epco were the most sensitive parameters to runoff generation in the catchments of the streams with t statistics of 1 22 and 1 21 respectively the other parameters that showed high sensitivities were curve number cn2 effective hydraulic conductivity in the main channel ch k2 soil organic carbon content sol cbn groundwater delay time gw delay saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil sol k and snowmelt base temperature smtmp which showed smaller t statistics between 0 05 and 0 77 all other parameters had negative t statistic values of up to 1 8 while canmx and epco were most sensitive to the flow in this study the two parameters have not often been rated as very essential in other studies for instance in the study of kim et al 2010 these parameters were ranked 11 and 15 respectively in another study that used swat to simulate the fate and transport of e coli in a river the epco was not reported among the top six parameters sensitive to flow in the river niazi et al 2015 these studies were conducted in areas with significant forest cover just as the location of the watershed in this study the high sensitivities of these parameters in this study may be due to interception of precipitation by the dense forest canopy constituting 67 and 63 of land cover in the donor and target catchments respectively as well as the morphology of the plant species present in this study area the forest in the catchments comprise temperate coniferous forest pine with low fractions of broadleaf evergreen and deciduous trees and grasslands moreover during the manual calibration of the flow model in the donor catchment the epco parameter was increased to allow higher compensation for plant uptake since lower flow levels were generated at lower epco values increasing the value of this parameter enables deeper soil layers to contribute towards compensating for water used by plants neitsch et al 2011 thereby increasing the generated flow other parameters such as the curve number cn2 which is controlled by the antecedent moisture condition of the soil was ranked 3rd in this study this parameter is used to calculate the runoff and greatly depends on the soil characteristics the ranking of this parameter in this study is consistent with results of other studies in which the parameter is often ranked as one of the most important parameters in flow calibration with swat kim et al 2010 niazi et al 2015 kim et al 2017 in addition hydraulic conductivity in the main channel ch k2 which ranked as the 4th in this study has been rated high in many studies that calibrated flow in tropical areas vilaysane et al 2015 rafiei emam et al 2016 kim et al 2017 the content of organic matter in the soil was very sensitive to the generated flows in both the donor and target catchments ranking 5th among the flow parameters as indicated in section 2 3 of this paper humus and peat constitute 53 and 63 of the two catchments respectively the properties of peat cover and vegetation as well as the pattern and orientation of peatland surface are among the major factors that regulate catchment runoff in forested peatlands emili and price 2006 kværner and kløve 2008 watersheds dominated by peat soils often have high infiltration rates and are able to hold water for a long time resulting in low runoff potential when they become fully saturated however intermittent runoff can be generated due to their shallow water table menberu et al 2014 although snowmelt is an important factor in overland flow generation in this region only the base rate temperature of snowmelt was ranked among the top ten most sensitive parameters in this study for the four other snowmelt parameters the snow pack temperature lag factor timp showed highest sensitivity ranking 14th these snow parameters smtmp and timp were ranked among the top ten most sensitive parameters in a related study kim et al 2010 results of the estimated streamflow hydrographs between 2013 and 2015 calibration period and from 2016 to 2017 validation period are shown in fig 2 the calibration output generally showed very good agreement with the transferred flows in both streams peak flow periods were not simulated with high precision in addition the model underestimated low flows occurring in the summer particularly in the slettebakk stream fig 2 a this may be caused by factors such as deficiencies in the climate data the flow regionalization process and characteristics specific to the donor and target catchment as indicated in section 2 1 of this study both the donor and target catchment receives high amount of rainfall throughout the seasons resulting in significantly high flows in the streams throughout the year for the average of 1987 mm of rainfall received annually in the main catchment of the brusdalsvatnet lake which includes the sub catchments of the modeled streams rainfall in summer june august and winter december february in this catchment are 688 mm and 1298 mm respectively however peak flows are often higher in the spring march may and autumn september november the performance indices of the flow and bacteria models as well as related results are shown in table 4 the value of the nash sutcliffe efficiency ns for the flow calibration of the slettebakk and brusdalen streams were respectively 0 68 and 0 70 while the coefficient of determination r2 were 0 72 and 0 74 respectively in addition values of p factor and r factor which respectively indicate the percentage of the transferred observations included within the 95 prediction uncertainty band 99ppu and the thickness of the uncertainty band abbaspour et al 2015 are also presented in table 4 3 2 e coli concentration and parameterization table 5 shows the results of the 15 calibrated e coli model parameters which include sediment transport related parameters and their sensitivities the two parameters most sensitive to the temporal variation of e coli in the streams were the exponent parameter for calculating sediment in channel routing spexp and the peak rate adjustment factor for sediment routing in the sub basin adj pkr the calibrated values for these parameters were respectively 1 33 and 1 32 respectively e coli variation was also sensitive to other sediment related parameters such as the linear parameter spcon and the channel bank erodability factors ch cov1 and ch cov2 these parameters mostly control the amount of sediments in the stream channels their high sensitivities to the concentrations of e coli in the streams may be due to the roles of sediment resuspension transport deposition processes in the streams that provide protection and nourishment for the e coli sediments can serve as either sources or sinks of e coli concentrations in freshwater ishii et al 2007 provide soluble organic matter and nutrients for the survival of bacteria and shield them from predators and exposure to uv radiations in sunlight jamieson et al 2004 sinclair et al 2012 furthermore attachment to streambed sediments is one of the most important mechanisms that increases the persistence of bacteria in water therefore bacteria concentrations in water can increase during high flow events due to resuspension of bottom sediments results of a study that used tracer bacteria to investigate the resuspension and persistence of sediment related bacteria in a stream showed that enteric bacteria can survive in bed sediments for up to six weeks jamieson et al 2005 moreover the attachment ratios of e coli to streambed sediments have been shown to increase with decreasing sediment sizes and the attachment and resuspension rates of the bacteria varied with different types of sediments studied cervantes 2012 further streambed sediment resuspension has been demonstrated to increase e coli concentrations in streams by up to two orders of magnitude muirhead et al 2004 other parameters that showed high sensitivities were the decay factor of e coli in the stream wdprch bacteria partition coefficient bactkdq bacteria partition coefficient bactkddb and the parameter that indicates the fraction of animal manure that contains active colonies of the bacteria bactkddb these parameters mainly control availability of bacteria on the soil surface to be transported by runoff the high sensitivities of the sediment related and the other deposition related parameters found in this study are consistent with results of other studies in which these parameters were ranked among the top ten niazi et al 2015 kim et al 2017 fig 3 shows comparisons of the concentrations of e coli from the model calibrations and the biweekly observations in the streams e coli data for january february and the entire summer period june august were not available the performance statistics for the models were not very good nse 0 30 r2 0 31 for slettebakk stream and nse 0 24 r2 0 26 for brusdalen stream the low performances of the models can be partly attributed to uncertainties in concentrations of e coli inputs from the farm and wild animals in the catchments as indicated in section 2 4 of the paper 14 observations were used in the e coli model calibrations it is worth noting that the bacteria module in swat only simulates the e coli concentrations based on average concentrations in animal manure the calibrations are separately performed to compare the model outputs with the observations such that performance indices can be calculated thus the model performance indices could have been higher if the calibrations were performed with larger number of observations despite the low accuracies the trends of the model predictions generally agreed with the pattern of observations of e coli in both streams the results indicate that lower concentrations of e coli in the streams occur in the winter months december february the concentrations become higher in the latter part of the spring season may and begin to decrease from the onset of the autumn season in september although the catchments receive relatively low precipitation in the summer months with low flows in the streams fig 2 the e coli concentrations in the streams are highest in this season this could be as a result of higher availability of wildlife in the catchments during summer which is warmer than the other seasons although the main sources of e coli contamination in the brusdalen stream fig 3b was assumed to be horses and sheep raised in the area 84 of its catchment is covered by forest while the slettebakk catchment is composed of 94 forest thus the occurrence of higher e coli concentrations in both streams in summer may be an indication that wildlife are important sources within both catchments moreover while precipitation plays a major role in determining the concentration of fib in surface water it could also cause dilution of concentrations of contaminants in the stream due to high flows and faster moving stream water low flows in summer could however result in the microorganism travelling a shorter distance and longer settling time in the streams as these factors also affect pathogen concentrations in surface water schijven et al 2013 although high temperature in summer can increase the die off rates of e coli in the streams high temperature could also enhance the persistence of the microorganism in farm animal faeces within the catchments oliver and page 2016 potentially leading to high concentrations in the streams further lower e coli concentrations mostly in the winter and spring seasons may be caused by snow cover on soil surface and in the streams which can reduce the fraction of animal manure washed into the streams 3 3 results of climate scenarios figs 4 and 5 show the results of the climate scenarios for flow and e coli concentrations in the streams in the flow projections figs 4a and 5a average daily flows were calculated from the observed values and the simulated climate data for the five year period the results indicate that flows in both streams may substantially increase in the future moreover pattern of the flows in the future can be different from current patterns for instance while the flows in the streams begin to rise at the onset of the autumn season september in the historical data this event may shift backwards since the flows start to rise in july for both 2045 and 2075 thus the current lower flow period in summer will be shortened further peak flows in the spring season may occur earlier winter in the future from the calculated change factors for the climate variables table 2 differences in median expected change in precipitation in the region across the various seasons for 2045 and 2075 is very small the calculated annual projected changes are 1 03 and 1 05 respectively accordingly the simulated flows in these years do not significantly vary although marginal increases may occur in the spring and autumn seasons in 2075 compared to the 2045 levels potential variations in the concentrations of e coli in the slettebakk and brusdalen streams in 2045 and 2075 figs 4b and 5b respectively indicate similar patterns of variation the results suggest that under the current climate projections for the region concentrations of e coli in the streams in 2045 and 2075 may remain similar to current levels observed in the winter and spring seasons possible future variations in the numbers of wild farm animals as well as other factors including future land use changes within the catchments can affect the predicted results however due to uncertainties associated with these factors it was not possible to account for them in the model compared to the high levels presently occurring throughout the summer lower concentrations might be observed in both streams in the future during the first two months of summer june and july however the autumn turnover period late august to early september may introduce high concentrations of e coli into the streams the potential variation in the patterns of discharge into the streams in the future as shown by the model predictions suggest that flow into and out of the drinking water source brusdalsvatnet lake could vary in future although the lake has high residence time of approximately 8 years changes in the total inflows from the over 150 tributaries may considerably influence circulation patterns in the lake this could lead to the occurrence of higher temperatures and higher concentrations of fibs and other contaminants at the raw water intake point of the ålesund water utility in late summer these potential shifts in the periods for which higher concentrations of contaminants are known to occur historically in the lake would provide the water utility managers the necessary information for developing climate adaptation strategies potential sources of uncertainties in the results of this study include the historical input data used for calibrating the models regionalization of measured flow the projected climate models used to adjust the meteorological variables model structure and parameters however due to lack of observations for future meteorological variables such uncertainties cannot be directly assessed and therefore difficult to reduce beven 2016 meresa et al 2017 moreover understanding of the hydrological processes and the essential parameters affecting runoff generation and microbial discharge into drinking water sources in norway is necessary for proactive decision making that will augment long term climate adaptation strategies for water utilities 4 conclusion we implemented a hydrological model to assess the impact of local climate projections on flow regimes and e coli discharge in the ungauged catchment of the drinking water source for the city of ålesund in norway the results illustrates that regionalization method is a highly efficient method for predicting discharge in ungauged catchments results of the climate scenarios for the flow indicate that under the current climate projections for møre and romsdal county of norway peak flows in the streams which currently occur in spring march may and autumn september november may be shifted back to winter december february and summer june august respectively the e coli concentrations in the streams could however remain the same in winter and spring while the high concentrations currently observed in summer may be low in future however compared to current levels e coli concentrations may be higher at the start of autumn in future late august early september with variations in the discharge patterns expected in the future circulation periods in the lake resulting from discharges from its tributaries may be shifted back from spring and autumn to winter and summer respectively this implies that high concentrations of e coli and other potential contaminants may occur at the raw water intake earlier late summer than the current period in autumn high e coli concentrations in rivers and streams indicate the potential presence of harmful pathogens that pose a public health risk to the people through either recreational activities or consumption of water produced from such waterbodies the health risks associated with water consumption from these rivers and streams can be significantly reduced if the expected time of their occurrence in the future are known by water utility managers this would enable the planning and implementation of optimal water treatment processes that accommodate the potential changes results of this study have implications for management

6542,the discharge of fecal indicator bacteria into surface water sources poses treatment challenges to drinking water utilities changes in the discharge regimes of streams resulting from extreme precipitation associated with climate change can exacerbate these challenges the catchments of many surface water sources depended upon by water treatment plants are ungauged thus making it difficult to predict the impacts of climate change on the microbial quality of such water sources in this study a hydrological model is implemented to assess the impact of local climate projections on flow regimes and e coli discharge in the ungauged catchment of the drinking water source for the city of ålesund in norway we performed separate sensitivity analysis for flow and e coli and assessed the variations in patterns of flow and e coli concentrations in the streams in future using adjusted meteorological data the calibrated flow showed good agreement with the observed data but the e coli model yielded lower performance indices the results indicate that interception of precipitation by forest cover and soil organic carbon content mostly control flow generation in the catchments and the variations in the concentrations of e coli were more sensitive to instream sediment processes flow levels in the streams would remain the same in 2045 and 2075 peak flows that currently occur in spring and autumn months may respectively shift back to winter and summer months high concentrations of e coli currently observed in summer in the streams may be lower in future but the concentrations may be high at the start of autumn seasons the results have management implications for watersheds and water utilities mostly in temperate climate regions keywords hydrological model climate change streamflow flow patterns e coli drinking water source 1 introduction climate and weather conditions practically affect every aspect of the environment and the intensities of primary weather variables such as precipitation and temperature are likely to increase in the 21st century due to climate change ipcc 2014 the norwegian climate has become warmer and precipitation has increased by 20 over the past 100 years current climate projections in norway indicate that precipitation may rise by 5 30 while temperature is expected to increase by between 2 3 c and 4 6 c norwegian ministry of climate and environment 2014 these projected changes in climatic variables are expected to impact on the quality and quantity of surface water sources that account for more than 90 of the country s drinking water supply bates et al 2008 brown et al 2013 norwegian ministry of climate and environment 2014 climate change related variations in air temperature and hydrological regimes of surface water sources can significantly cause deteriorations in the quality of water variations in precipitation may increase or decrease the concentrations of microorganisms in receiving surface waterbodies through increased runoffs sediment transport and resuspension in streams hofstra 2011 aragonés et al 2016 lucas et al 2014 observed trends in the deterioration of drinking water quality under changing climate can increase public health risk delpla et al 2009 in addition climate change is expected to vary the availability variability and seasonality of discharge in rivers whitehead et al 2015 affect the incidence of waterborne pathogens and pose greater management problems in the future patz and hahn 2013 accordingly there is a growing need for investigating potential changes in hydrological extremes of surface waterbodies stahl et al 2012 and predicting faecal indicator bacteria fib concentrations fluxes and loads in a variety of waterbodies to provide the necessary policy framework and guidelines to address water quality challenges in the future cho et al 2016 the severity of climate impacts on the quality of surface water bodies does not only depend on the magnitude of the expected changes in climate variables but also developments in future land use in addition the negative impacts of climate change on the quality of raw water sources can be reduced if water utilities have the capacities to plan and implement effective adaptation strategies within the catchments of their raw water sources that take into account the effects of climate change the development of such strategies require an integrated approach that links climate change projections to hydrological processes within the catchments of raw water sources for water utilities that mainly rely on surface water sources it is essential to evaluate and understand the imminent management challenges and potential health risks that may be associated with variabilities in the pattern of microbial discharge in the future due to climate change securing long term safety of the drinking water source is necessary for sustainable management of drinking water supply systems investigating the impacts of climate change on hydrological flow and water quality regimes of raw water sources usually involve the application of hydrological models using historical climate data and projected data obtained by adjusting historical observations based on assumed future climate scenarios wilby and harris 2006 for this a number of studies have examined the effects of climate change on flow regimes at catchment scales graham et al 2007 prudhomme davies 2009 vansteenkiste et al 2013 meresa et al 2017 in the work of meresa et al 2017 in which the trends in selected hydro climatic indices in norwegian and polish catchments were investigated the authors observed that periods of increased precipitation in catchments with rainfall driven floods were followed by increased flow levels with strong seasonal changes for catchments with snow driven flood regimes however decreases in annual maximum flows were observed over the studied period meresa et al 2017 moreover results of a study that investigated hydrological regimes under future climatic conditions in central norway revealed that climate change would strongly influence stream flow with more evenly distributed flow volumes across seasons and significant reduction in the amount of snow cover hiriyanna rao ravindra 2017 in respect of modeling the discharge of fib into surface water the focus of many studies has been on improving the understanding of the effects of hydrological processes on their fate and transport in the environment jonsson and agerberg 2015 niazi et al 2015 as well as the effects of in stream processes kim et al 2017 to date few studies have linked the discharge of faecal indicator organisms fib to climate induced changes to flow patterns that may occur in future liu and chan 2015 to our knowledge no study has been undertaken in scandinavia to account for the effects of climate change on the hydrological response and water quality e coli concentrations within the catchments of drinking water sources further although water supply systems in norway have improved over the last 20 30 years most of the catchments of drinking water sources are ungauged the ungauged nature of the catchments inhibits the development of effective strategies for water safety planning especially on the impact of climate change on hydrological processes and water quality within the catchments there are existing approaches involving the transfer of hydrological parameters in catchments that share common spatial characteristics to help address this challenge in this study hydrological model using existing approaches is implemented to assess the impact of local climate projections on flow regimes and e coli discharge in the ungauged catchment of the drinking water source for the city of ålesund in norway the approach used in this study is expected to be replicated for other ungauged catchments in norway particularly those serving drinking water treatment plants and are potentially vulnerable to climate change in addition the results of the study are expected to contribute to improvement in understanding of potential impact of climate change on the quality of surface water drinking water sources in norway 2 materials and methods 2 1 brusdalsvatnet lake and catchment the streams modelled in this study discharge into the brusdalsvatnet lake which is located within the inland of oksenøya in the møre and romsdal county between ålesund and skodje municipalities in the west coast of norway fig 1 the west coast of norway is a mountainous and densely forested region that receives significant amount of rainfall throughout the four seasons of the year though peak rainfalls occur mostly in spring march may and autumn september november brusdalsvatnet lake provides drinking water to the 50 000 inhabitants of the city of ålesund and neighbouring sula municipality the lake has a surface area of approximately 7 21 km2 with a catchment area of approximately 28 1 km2 the lake has a mean surface elevation of 26 m above sea level the altitude of the catchment therefore varies from 26 m lake surface to 559 m in the southern and southeastern sections of the catchment the mean elevation in the northern side of the lake is approximately 200 m the deepest section of the lake is 94 m located at the central part of its longitudinal section the drinking water treatment plant draws 55 000 cubic meters of water daily at a depth of 35 m from the southwestern section of the lake the northwestern and southwestern sections of the lake catchment are sparsely populated with settlements while the other sections are uninhabited with little anthropogenic activities among the tributaries of the lake are two rivers arsetelva and vasstrandelva which are located on the southern side and two major streams slettebakk and brusdalen fig 1c results from an ongoing water quality survey in these tributaries show that the two streams slettebakk and brusdalen discharge very high concentrations of e coli 551 1160 cfu 100 ml into the lake compared to average concentrations of 11 cfu 100 ml observed in the other major tributaries of the lake thus this study focused on modeling water flow and e coli discharges from these streams fig 1d e the gauged catchment engesetdalsvatnet lake from which discharge and hydrological model parameters were transferred to the target catchment is shown in fig 1b comparison of the spatial and meteorological characteristics of the donor and target catchments are further presented in table 1 2 2 regionalization of flow data from gauged to ungauged catchment the target catchment in this study brusdalsvatnet lake is currently not equipped with gauging stations accordingly obtaining estimates of the discharge into the streams in this catchment required the use of regionalization usually catchments that are within the same climate region and with similar characteristics such as topography soil type land use precipitation and temperature have similar hydrological behavior hydrological model parameters for such ungauged catchments can be estimated by regionalization bárdossy 2007 this involves transferring the hydrological parameters of the gauged catchment onto the ungauged methods applied in such transformations include area ratio transformation regression bastola et al 2008 physical similarity mcintyre et al 2005 spatial proximity merz and blöshla 2004 or more advanced methods such as kriging parajka et al 2005 and those based on satellite radar altimetry observations sun et al 2012 in this study we applied the area ratio method to transfer measured flow data from the donor catchment to our target catchment the hydrological model was first calibrated for the donor catchment and the parameters applied to the target finally the transferred flow was used for comparison with the estimated flows in the target streams the characteristics of the donor and target catchments in this study are shown in table 1 in this table rainfall and runoff are presented in units of average depth of water over the drainage basins per year mm year it can be seen in table 1 that runoff in the donor catchment 1732 mm year is higher than the annual mean rainfall in the catchment 1704 mm year except for the characteristics of precipitation in the catchment such as type rainfall and snow intensity duration distribution and antecedent precipitation other factors can influence the amount of runoff generated these include watershed characteristics such as size shape or form factor altitude slope land use and depressions in addition the donor catchment is in a higher altitude where storage of snow occurs for a longer period in the year potentially contributing to the higher runoff 2 3 spatial and geomorphological characteristics of catchment spatial data needed to specify the catchment attributes included land use and soil types digital maps for land use was obtained from the forest and landscape services unit of the norwegian institute for bioeconomy nibio while the norwegian geological survey ngu provided data for soil and sediment types in the catchments it can be seen from table 1 that the annual estimates of the precipitation in the donor catchment is significantly lower approximately 15 than in the target catchments despite the relatively larger size of the former relative to the donor catchments the target catchment is located closer to the coast the coastal areas in the region generally receive higher rainfall than the inland areas possibly due to interception of the clouds by the mountains in the area in addition the donor catchment is composed of approximately 67 forest while the slettebakk and brusdalen catchments target are respectively comprise of 95 and 84 forest cover this relatively larger proportion of forest canopies in the target catchments can substantially favor the amount of precipitation in the catchment despite the relatively larger size of the donor catchment the differences in the annual runoff is approximately 38 compared to the target catchment this may be caused by differences in other watershed characteristics as mentioned in section 2 2 of this study subsequently some differences in the parameters that control runoff generation in the two catchments may be expected in the hydrological model potentially affecting the model predictions for this reason additional calibration was performed for the target catchment for use in predicting the future runoff as explained in section 2 7 4 of this study as shown in table 1 the slettebakk and brusdalen streams modelled in this study are relatively small with channel lengths of 0 5 km and 1 km respectively due to the steep topography of the catchment the widths of the channels vary significantly and the widest sections of the two streams slettebakk and brusdalen are approximately 1 m and 1 5 m respectively for in addition the base flow in both streams is 0 01 l s although there are no specific data on sediment size distributions in the streams average concentrations of suspended sediments in streams located in the study region west coast of the norway have been reported to range from 13 mg l to 24 mg l bechmann et al 2008 while no specific farming activity exists in the slettebakk stream catchment farm animals including sheep and horses are located in the brusdalen sub catchment similarly the dominant soil types in the catchments are podzols spodosols and moraine both of which are characterized by high humus content and or peat cover and are freely drained the proportions in the donor catchment are podzols cover 53 and moraine soil rocks and sediments 46 while target catchments of the streams are both composed of 100 podzols 2 4 e coli input and calibration data biweekly water sampling and e coli analysis were carried out from the two streams slettebakk and brusdalen in two periods in 2017 from march to may 2017 and from mid august to december 2017 a total of 14 samples were collected in sterile 250 ml bottles e coli analysis was performed using membrane filtration mf method the mf method involved filtration of 100 ml of water samples through sterile single packed microporous membranes 47 mm diameter 0 45 0 02 µm pore size with grid the membranes were transferred with sterile tweezers on to coliform chromogenic agar cca media iso 9308 1 2000 for e coli cultivation at 37 c for 24 h the observed e coli cfu 100 ml were used to validate the bacteria model for the two streams in the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 arnold et al 2012 typical concentrations of e coli from domestic and wild animal manure horses sheep and deer that dominate the stream sub catchments needed as inputs to the swat model were based on values published in a report of the norwegian institute for water research niva berge et al 2011 according to the report average concentrations of e coli per 23 kg faeces of a horse per day is 5 109 cfu and can vary from 107 to 1011 cfu the corresponding average value for sheep is 1 1010 cfu with variation of 108 1011 and 2 108 cfu for deer there are stables with 10 horses in the brusdalen stream sub catchment but the actual number of sheep in the farm located within the sub catchment was not ascertained from the farmer during our regular sampling exercise we counted 20 sheep in the area close to the stream further visual inspection of the location during sampling indicated that the horse stables and the sheep nearby the stream will contribute to faecal contamination for the slettebakk stream sub catchment potential population of deer was obtained from the ålesund local hunting group who reported 40 individuals seen within 33 days over a wider area which comprises the sub catchment based on this information and the concentrations published in the niva report the daily loadings of e coli in dry animal manure into the streams were set as 7 5 108 cfu g and 2 108 cfu g respectively for the brusdalen and slettebakk sub catchments 2 5 climate data and bias correction except for catchment characteristics hydrological processes in catchments are mainly driven by climatic variables these include precipitation air temperature as well as shortwave and longwave solar radiations in this study daily precipitation mm day minimum and maximum temperature c were obtained from six weather stations fig 1 the data constituting daily measurements from each of the stations from 2010 to 2017 was taken from an online database provided by the norwegian water resources and energy directorate nve the weather stations include vigra lat 62 5617 long 6 115 hildre lat 62 6017 long 6 3187 ålesund iv lat 62 4703 long 6 2108 ørskog lat 62 4775 long 6 8167 brusdalsvatn ii lat 62 4654 long 6 4013 and emblem lat 62 4317 long 6 4325 the elevations of the weather stations ranged from 1 m to 33 m above sea level missing data points occurring in records were estimated using linear interpolation daily averages were calculated from the six weather stations and used as inputs for the hydrological model the soil and water analysis tool swat program used for the modelling in this study simulated other relevant weather parameters including solar radiation wind speed and humidity in addition the program calculated potential evapotranspiration using the penman monteith equation to simulate the flows and e coli concentrations in the streams for future scenarios we used air temperature and precipitation data from the representative concentration pathways rcp 8 5 climate models for the møre and romsdal region of norway the rcp8 5 uses three scenarios for emissions of greenhouse gases and estimates climate change for up to 2100 the model uses the period 1971 2000 as the base year and estimates climate change for up to year 2100 bias correction of the climate data was carried out using change factor method arnell 1996 hijmans et al 2005 mean seasonal outputs of the rcp 8 5 model were taken from the norwegian climate service center and the differences between the current values 2010 2017 and future projections 2045 and 2075 were calculated thus to adjust the precipitation data we calculated the ratios between the rcp 8 5 simulations for future and current climate the seasonal ratios were multiplied by the historical time series to obtain daily precipitation for 2045 and 2075 for air temperature the change factors were added to the historical data based on median projections for the four major seasons in the region the calculated change factors for 2045 and 2075 are shown in table 2 2 6 hydrological model setup and input parameters swat was used for the hydrological model swat is a physically based and spatially distributed hydrological model designed for simulating water flow sediments and contaminant transport within ungauged catchments arnold et al 1998 arnold et al 2012 in swat catchments are partitioned into sub basins and hydrological response units hrus which are lumped land areas within the sub basin composed of specific land use soil type topographic characteristics and management interventions that together describe the spatial heterogeneity of the catchment for each hru key hydrological parameters such as evapotranspiration runoff sediment yield and contaminant loads are simulated on daily monthly or annual time steps setting up the model requires various spatial data inputs organized into climate hrus ponds wetlands groundwater and the main channel reach which drains the sub basin the main input data are digital elevation model dem land use map soil map and meteorological data the swat simulates the hydrology of a watershed using two stages the land phase which controls the amount of water sediment and contaminant loadings to the main channel and the routing phase which describes the movement of the water and associated loads to the channel outlet this entire hydrologic cycle simulated in swat is based on the water balance equation expressed as 1 sw t sw 0 i 1 t r day q surf e a w seep q gw where sw 0 a n d s w t are the initial and final water content of the soil respectively on day i mm h2o t is the time days r day is the amount of input precipitation on day i mm h2o q surf and q gw are respectively the amounts of surface runoff and return flow to groundwater on day i e a is amount of evapotranspiration and w seep is the quantity of water that enters the vadose zone from the soil on day i thus the total runoff for day i comprises routed response from each hru the model predicts runoff for each hru in the watershed resulting in higher accuracy in estimating the hydrological response of the watershed in this study we used the arc swat version 2012 which is an extension in arcgis to obtain the hydrological parameters of the donor catchment engesetdalsvatnet lake the engesetdalsvatnet lake catchment was discretized into 29 hrus with 4 slope classes 0 15 15 30 30 50 and 50 and simulated on daily time steps between 2013 and 2017 the slettebakk and brusdalen watersheds were respectively divided into 21 and 26 sub basins with four slope classes for both the input meteorological data actually begins from january 2010 to december 2017 and the first three years 2010 2012 was used as a warm up period 2 7 modelling e coli concentrations in streams 2 7 1 bacteria wash off and transport in the swat model e coli loading within the target catchments were introduced into hrus in the form of dry manure from the animals within the catchments further transport and die off of e coli in the soil surface layer top 10 mm and in the streams were governed by mass transport and die off regrowth models neitsch et al 2011 for a given precipitation event in a given day in the catchment the fraction of e coli cfu m2 washed off from plant foliage onto the soil bact wsh is calculated using 2 bact wsh fr wsh bact fol where fr wsh is the wash off fraction and bact fol is the amount attached to the foliage this wash off fraction is a function of plant morphology e coli characteristics and the timing and intensity of the rainfall event in the model e coli is assumed to remain in solution in the soil surface layer that interacts with surface runoff the net change in e coli loading in the surface soil for day i δ s u r f a c e bact can be described as niazi et al 2015 3 δ s u r f a c e bact bact load bact wsh bact die bact runoff bact perc bact till where bact load is the total e coli loading to the soil on day i bact die is the die off fraction bact runoff is the transported fraction through runoff bact perc is the concentration percolated into the soil and bact till accounts for the concentration percolated into the soil profile through tillage similarly the net change in bacteria in the stream δ s t r e a m bact is governed by 4 δ s t r e a m bact bact inflow bact runoff bact direct i n p u t s bact resuspension bact sed bact die bact outflow where bact inflow is the initial concentration of e coli on day i bact direct i n p u t s is the e coli concentration from direct deposition from sources such as wildlife bact resuspension is the e coli concentration added through resuspension of sediments bact sed is the deposited concentration of e coli from sediments bact outflow is the e coli transported to lower reaches of the stream while all the other input parameters are as defined in eq 3 2 7 2 swat sediment module transport of sediments in swat is composed of landscape and channel parts daily sediment yield in the landscape component sed for day i tons is calculated using the modified universal soil losses equation musle williams 1975 as 5 sed 11 8 q surf q peak area hru 0 56 u s l e k u s l e c u s l e p l s u s l e c f r g where q surf is the runoff volume on the soil surface mm h2o ha 1 q peak is the peak runoff rate m3 s 1 area hru is the area of the hru ha usle k usle c usle p and lsusle are respectively the soil erodability factor ton m2 hr m3 ton cm cover management factor support practice factor and topographic factor for usle and cfrg is the coarse fragment factor for the stream channel the amount of

respectively and are defined by the user these parameters are used in calculating the channel sediment routing the parameter v ch p k is the peak velocity of water in the channel ms 1 2 7 3 bacteria die off and regrowth using first order decay the fate and transport of e coli from the manure applications soil and soil water soil adsorption and runoff partition were modelled using the following equations sadeghi arnold 2002 7a bact fol i bact fol i 1 x exp μ fol n e t bact min 7b bact sol i bact sol i 1 x exp μ sol n e t bact min 7c bact sorb i bact sorb i 1 x exp μ sorb n e t bact min where bact fol i bact sol i a n d bact sorb i are the level of e coli in day i and b a c t fol i 1 b a c t sol i 1 bact sorb i 1 are levels of e coli present on foliage in soil solution and adsorbed to soil particles on day i 1 respectively μ net is the overall rate constant for die off regrowth of e coli while bact min represents the minimum daily loss of e coli the effect of temperature on e coli die off regrowth in these pools are accounted for by calculating the net rate constants μ net 20 for each process at 20 c and adjusted for temperature using 8 μ net 20 μ die 20 μ grw 20 9 μ net μ net 20 x

air temperature the die off process in the stream network is modelled as 10 bact i bact i 1 x exp w d p r c h where bact i and bact i 1 are the e coli concentrations in the reach on day i and day i 1 respectively cfu 100 ml and wdprch day 1 is the die off rate constant for e coli in the streams 2 7 4 calibration and validation of flow and e coli concentrations in the streams first manual calibration of daily flow at the monitoring outlet of the donor catchment was carried out in swat from 2013 to 2017 using the preceding three years 2010 2012 as model warmup period large number of model parameters present in the swat complicates the manual calibration thus an automatic calibration and sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the most important parameters that control the discharge level in the catchment this was achieved using the sequential uncertainty fitting tool sufi2 in the swat calibration and uncertainty program swat cup abbaspour 2007 abbaspour et al 2007 the fitted values of the most sensitive parameters were subsequently applied to the ungauged catchments of the drinking water source brusdalsvatnet lake to simulate daily flow in the two streams slettebakk and brusdalen in swat from 2013 to 2015 to evaluate the uncertainties and sensitivities of the model parameters in the target catchments we performed additional calibrations in swat cup using the flow data transferred from the donor catchment after the flow simulations e coli concentrations in the streams were estimated using the bacteria module in swat validation of the simulated flow in the streams were performed in swat cup using the fitted parameters and transferred data for 2016 and 2017 in a single model run the program was also used to validate the e coli models with the concentrations observed in the streams in 2017 and to determine the parameters that were most sensitive to the concentrations of e coli finally climate scenarios for flow and e coli were simulated for the two streams using the calibrated parameters and the adjusted meteorological data 2 7 5 model uncertainty and sensitivity analysis uncertainties in the estimated flow and e coli concentrations in the streams were evaluated using the sufi2 procedure in the swat cup program using initial ranges of parameters taken the sufi2 procedure caries out a number of specified iterations until the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu and the average distance between the 2 5th and 97 5th percentiles is smaller than the standard deviation of the measured data the parameter combinations within the parameter ranges are used to find the best parameter ranges that yield the best fit abbaspour 2007 the algorithm also calculates two statistics p factor which indicates the percentage of the observed data enveloped by the model results and the r factor which shows the thickness of the 95ppu envelop these statistics are used to quantify the fit between simulation results and generally larger values considered more efficient abbaspour 2007 other hydrological model efficiency indices such as the nash sutcliff efficiency ns and the coefficient of determination r2 are calculated by the algorithm in this study the ns objective function was used as the objective function for comparing the simulated and observed daily flows further the algorithm determines parameter sensitivity by regressing the latin hypercube generated parameters against the values of a chosen objective function a t test is then used to evaluate the relative significance of each parameter more sensitive parameters have larger absolute values of the t statistic in this study the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis for flow and e coli concentrations each involved one at a time option for visual inspection of the effect of each parameter and the global sensitivity analysis for ranking the parameters based on their t statistics and p values based on the t statistics we ranked the parameters from 1 most sensitive to n least sensitive 3 results and discussion 3 1 stream flow and parametrization the ranges fitted values and the sensitivity ranks of the 25 hydrological parameters calibrated in the donor and target catchments are summarized in table 3 the difference between some of the parameters in the two catchments donor and target may reflect disparities in watershed characteristics such as land use and altitude that are local to each catchment comparison of the parameters in the target catchment with those obtained in the calibration of the donor catchment revealed no distinct disparities in the sensitivities this indicates that both catchments have similar hydrological responses the results illustrates that the canopy storage canmx and plant uptake compensation factor epco were the most sensitive parameters to runoff generation in the catchments of the streams with t statistics of 1 22 and 1 21 respectively the other parameters that showed high sensitivities were curve number cn2 effective hydraulic conductivity in the main channel ch k2 soil organic carbon content sol cbn groundwater delay time gw delay saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil sol k and snowmelt base temperature smtmp which showed smaller t statistics between 0 05 and 0 77 all other parameters had negative t statistic values of up to 1 8 while canmx and epco were most sensitive to the flow in this study the two parameters have not often been rated as very essential in other studies for instance in the study of kim et al 2010 these parameters were ranked 11 and 15 respectively in another study that used swat to simulate the fate and transport of e coli in a river the epco was not reported among the top six parameters sensitive to flow in the river niazi et al 2015 these studies were conducted in areas with significant forest cover just as the location of the watershed in this study the high sensitivities of these parameters in this study may be due to interception of precipitation by the dense forest canopy constituting 67 and 63 of land cover in the donor and target catchments respectively as well as the morphology of the plant species present in this study area the forest in the catchments comprise temperate coniferous forest pine with low fractions of broadleaf evergreen and deciduous trees and grasslands moreover during the manual calibration of the flow model in the donor catchment the epco parameter was increased to allow higher compensation for plant uptake since lower flow levels were generated at lower epco values increasing the value of this parameter enables deeper soil layers to contribute towards compensating for water used by plants neitsch et al 2011 thereby increasing the generated flow other parameters such as the curve number cn2 which is controlled by the antecedent moisture condition of the soil was ranked 3rd in this study this parameter is used to calculate the runoff and greatly depends on the soil characteristics the ranking of this parameter in this study is consistent with results of other studies in which the parameter is often ranked as one of the most important parameters in flow calibration with swat kim et al 2010 niazi et al 2015 kim et al 2017 in addition hydraulic conductivity in the main channel ch k2 which ranked as the 4th in this study has been rated high in many studies that calibrated flow in tropical areas vilaysane et al 2015 rafiei emam et al 2016 kim et al 2017 the content of organic matter in the soil was very sensitive to the generated flows in both the donor and target catchments ranking 5th among the flow parameters as indicated in section 2 3 of this paper humus and peat constitute 53 and 63 of the two catchments respectively the properties of peat cover and vegetation as well as the pattern and orientation of peatland surface are among the major factors that regulate catchment runoff in forested peatlands emili and price 2006 kværner and kløve 2008 watersheds dominated by peat soils often have high infiltration rates and are able to hold water for a long time resulting in low runoff potential when they become fully saturated however intermittent runoff can be generated due to their shallow water table menberu et al 2014 although snowmelt is an important factor in overland flow generation in this region only the base rate temperature of snowmelt was ranked among the top ten most sensitive parameters in this study for the four other snowmelt parameters the snow pack temperature lag factor timp showed highest sensitivity ranking 14th these snow parameters smtmp and timp were ranked among the top ten most sensitive parameters in a related study kim et al 2010 results of the estimated streamflow hydrographs between 2013 and 2015 calibration period and from 2016 to 2017 validation period are shown in fig 2 the calibration output generally showed very good agreement with the transferred flows in both streams peak flow periods were not simulated with high precision in addition the model underestimated low flows occurring in the summer particularly in the slettebakk stream fig 2 a this may be caused by factors such as deficiencies in the climate data the flow regionalization process and characteristics specific to the donor and target catchment as indicated in section 2 1 of this study both the donor and target catchment receives high amount of rainfall throughout the seasons resulting in significantly high flows in the streams throughout the year for the average of 1987 mm of rainfall received annually in the main catchment of the brusdalsvatnet lake which includes the sub catchments of the modeled streams rainfall in summer june august and winter december february in this catchment are 688 mm and 1298 mm respectively however peak flows are often higher in the spring march may and autumn september november the performance indices of the flow and bacteria models as well as related results are shown in table 4 the value of the nash sutcliffe efficiency ns for the flow calibration of the slettebakk and brusdalen streams were respectively 0 68 and 0 70 while the coefficient of determination r2 were 0 72 and 0 74 respectively in addition values of p factor and r factor which respectively indicate the percentage of the transferred observations included within the 95 prediction uncertainty band 99ppu and the thickness of the uncertainty band abbaspour et al 2015 are also presented in table 4 3 2 e coli concentration and parameterization table 5 shows the results of the 15 calibrated e coli model parameters which include sediment transport related parameters and their sensitivities the two parameters most sensitive to the temporal variation of e coli in the streams were the exponent parameter for calculating sediment in channel routing spexp and the peak rate adjustment factor for sediment routing in the sub basin adj pkr the calibrated values for these parameters were respectively 1 33 and 1 32 respectively e coli variation was also sensitive to other sediment related parameters such as the linear parameter spcon and the channel bank erodability factors ch cov1 and ch cov2 these parameters mostly control the amount of sediments in the stream channels their high sensitivities to the concentrations of e coli in the streams may be due to the roles of sediment resuspension transport deposition processes in the streams that provide protection and nourishment for the e coli sediments can serve as either sources or sinks of e coli concentrations in freshwater ishii et al 2007 provide soluble organic matter and nutrients for the survival of bacteria and shield them from predators and exposure to uv radiations in sunlight jamieson et al 2004 sinclair et al 2012 furthermore attachment to streambed sediments is one of the most important mechanisms that increases the persistence of bacteria in water therefore bacteria concentrations in water can increase during high flow events due to resuspension of bottom sediments results of a study that used tracer bacteria to investigate the resuspension and persistence of sediment related bacteria in a stream showed that enteric bacteria can survive in bed sediments for up to six weeks jamieson et al 2005 moreover the attachment ratios of e coli to streambed sediments have been shown to increase with decreasing sediment sizes and the attachment and resuspension rates of the bacteria varied with different types of sediments studied cervantes 2012 further streambed sediment resuspension has been demonstrated to increase e coli concentrations in streams by up to two orders of magnitude muirhead et al 2004 other parameters that showed high sensitivities were the decay factor of e coli in the stream wdprch bacteria partition coefficient bactkdq bacteria partition coefficient bactkddb and the parameter that indicates the fraction of animal manure that contains active colonies of the bacteria bactkddb these parameters mainly control availability of bacteria on the soil surface to be transported by runoff the high sensitivities of the sediment related and the other deposition related parameters found in this study are consistent with results of other studies in which these parameters were ranked among the top ten niazi et al 2015 kim et al 2017 fig 3 shows comparisons of the concentrations of e coli from the model calibrations and the biweekly observations in the streams e coli data for january february and the entire summer period june august were not available the performance statistics for the models were not very good nse 0 30 r2 0 31 for slettebakk stream and nse 0 24 r2 0 26 for brusdalen stream the low performances of the models can be partly attributed to uncertainties in concentrations of e coli inputs from the farm and wild animals in the catchments as indicated in section 2 4 of the paper 14 observations were used in the e coli model calibrations it is worth noting that the bacteria module in swat only simulates the e coli concentrations based on average concentrations in animal manure the calibrations are separately performed to compare the model outputs with the observations such that performance indices can be calculated thus the model performance indices could have been higher if the calibrations were performed with larger number of observations despite the low accuracies the trends of the model predictions generally agreed with the pattern of observations of e coli in both streams the results indicate that lower concentrations of e coli in the streams occur in the winter months december february the concentrations become higher in the latter part of the spring season may and begin to decrease from the onset of the autumn season in september although the catchments receive relatively low precipitation in the summer months with low flows in the streams fig 2 the e coli concentrations in the streams are highest in this season this could be as a result of higher availability of wildlife in the catchments during summer which is warmer than the other seasons although the main sources of e coli contamination in the brusdalen stream fig 3b was assumed to be horses and sheep raised in the area 84 of its catchment is covered by forest while the slettebakk catchment is composed of 94 forest thus the occurrence of higher e coli concentrations in both streams in summer may be an indication that wildlife are important sources within both catchments moreover while precipitation plays a major role in determining the concentration of fib in surface water it could also cause dilution of concentrations of contaminants in the stream due to high flows and faster moving stream water low flows in summer could however result in the microorganism travelling a shorter distance and longer settling time in the streams as these factors also affect pathogen concentrations in surface water schijven et al 2013 although high temperature in summer can increase the die off rates of e coli in the streams high temperature could also enhance the persistence of the microorganism in farm animal faeces within the catchments oliver and page 2016 potentially leading to high concentrations in the streams further lower e coli concentrations mostly in the winter and spring seasons may be caused by snow cover on soil surface and in the streams which can reduce the fraction of animal manure washed into the streams 3 3 results of climate scenarios figs 4 and 5 show the results of the climate scenarios for flow and e coli concentrations in the streams in the flow projections figs 4a and 5a average daily flows were calculated from the observed values and the simulated climate data for the five year period the results indicate that flows in both streams may substantially increase in the future moreover pattern of the flows in the future can be different from current patterns for instance while the flows in the streams begin to rise at the onset of the autumn season september in the historical data this event may shift backwards since the flows start to rise in july for both 2045 and 2075 thus the current lower flow period in summer will be shortened further peak flows in the spring season may occur earlier winter in the future from the calculated change factors for the climate variables table 2 differences in median expected change in precipitation in the region across the various seasons for 2045 and 2075 is very small the calculated annual projected changes are 1 03 and 1 05 respectively accordingly the simulated flows in these years do not significantly vary although marginal increases may occur in the spring and autumn seasons in 2075 compared to the 2045 levels potential variations in the concentrations of e coli in the slettebakk and brusdalen streams in 2045 and 2075 figs 4b and 5b respectively indicate similar patterns of variation the results suggest that under the current climate projections for the region concentrations of e coli in the streams in 2045 and 2075 may remain similar to current levels observed in the winter and spring seasons possible future variations in the numbers of wild farm animals as well as other factors including future land use changes within the catchments can affect the predicted results however due to uncertainties associated with these factors it was not possible to account for them in the model compared to the high levels presently occurring throughout the summer lower concentrations might be observed in both streams in the future during the first two months of summer june and july however the autumn turnover period late august to early september may introduce high concentrations of e coli into the streams the potential variation in the patterns of discharge into the streams in the future as shown by the model predictions suggest that flow into and out of the drinking water source brusdalsvatnet lake could vary in future although the lake has high residence time of approximately 8 years changes in the total inflows from the over 150 tributaries may considerably influence circulation patterns in the lake this could lead to the occurrence of higher temperatures and higher concentrations of fibs and other contaminants at the raw water intake point of the ålesund water utility in late summer these potential shifts in the periods for which higher concentrations of contaminants are known to occur historically in the lake would provide the water utility managers the necessary information for developing climate adaptation strategies potential sources of uncertainties in the results of this study include the historical input data used for calibrating the models regionalization of measured flow the projected climate models used to adjust the meteorological variables model structure and parameters however due to lack of observations for future meteorological variables such uncertainties cannot be directly assessed and therefore difficult to reduce beven 2016 meresa et al 2017 moreover understanding of the hydrological processes and the essential parameters affecting runoff generation and microbial discharge into drinking water sources in norway is necessary for proactive decision making that will augment long term climate adaptation strategies for water utilities 4 conclusion we implemented a hydrological model to assess the impact of local climate projections on flow regimes and e coli discharge in the ungauged catchment of the drinking water source for the city of ålesund in norway the results illustrates that regionalization method is a highly efficient method for predicting discharge in ungauged catchments results of the climate scenarios for the flow indicate that under the current climate projections for møre and romsdal county of norway peak flows in the streams which currently occur in spring march may and autumn september november may be shifted back to winter december february and summer june august respectively the e coli concentrations in the streams could however remain the same in winter and spring while the high concentrations currently observed in summer may be low in future however compared to current levels e coli concentrations may be higher at the start of autumn in future late august early september with variations in the discharge patterns expected in the future circulation periods in the lake resulting from discharges from its tributaries may be shifted back from spring and autumn to winter and summer respectively this implies that high concentrations of e coli and other potential contaminants may occur at the raw water intake earlier late summer than the current period in autumn high e coli concentrations in rivers and streams indicate the potential presence of harmful pathogens that pose a public health risk to the people through either recreational activities or consumption of water produced from such waterbodies the health risks associated with water consumption from these rivers and streams can be significantly reduced if the expected time of their occurrence in the future are known by water utility managers this would enable the planning and implementation of optimal water treatment processes that accommodate the potential changes results of this study have implications for management

6543,numerous studies have been conducted on 137cs transport in the environment in fukushima japan since the fukushima dai ichi nuclear power plant fdnpp accident many studies have monitored river and stream water and a declining trend in dissolved 137cs concentrations has been reported in addition temporary increases in dissolved 137cs concentrations have been observed during rainstorm events however the source and process of such temporary increases remain poorly understood to address these gaps in knowledge intense multi point sampling and analysis of dissolved 137cs in stream water soil water and groundwater were conducted in a forested headwater catchment in yamakiya district located 35 km northwest of the fdnpp from july 2015 to november 2016 the average dissolved 137cs concentration in stream water during baseflow conditions was 17 mbq l whereas the concentration during rainstorm events was 31 mbq l maximum 170 mbq l on july 15 2015 the dissolved 137cs concentration in groundwater average 0 93 mbq l was lower than that in stream water conversely high concentrations of dissolved 137cs in soil water were observed average 81 mbq l particularly at lower parts of the slope near the spring point and in wet conditions throughout summer consequently the dissolved 137cs concentrations in stream water were considered to be derived mainly from soil water and diluted by groundwater the high dissolved 137cs concentration in soil water may be derived from litter leachate in the shallow soil layer stored on the slope during rainstorm events the saturated area expands upward therefore the temporary increase in the dissolved 137cs concentration in stream water observed at the beginning of a rainstorm may be caused by the release of high levels of dissolved 137cs in soil water stored in the shallow soil layer keywords dissolved 137cs forested headwater catchment fukushima dai ichi nuclear power plant stream water subsurface water 1 introduction following the earthquake and tsunami disaster on march 11 2011 the fukushima dai ichi nuclear power plant fdnpp accident resulted in a substantial release of radionuclides into the environment subsequently a large forested area in northeast fukushima received local fallout of 0 3 1 0 mbq m2 137cs ministry of education culture sports science and technology mext 2011 studies of forested areas in fukushima have shown that radionuclides remained in the forest even 4 years after the accident for instance the 137cs distribution in forests from tree crowns to the forest floor was revealed by an aerial dose rate survey kato and onda 2014 and by monitoring the transfer of canopy intercepted 137cs to the forest floor by measuring throughfall stemflow and litterfall kato et al 2015 yoschenko et al 2016 yoschenko et al 2016 reported that the majority 74 of 137cs initially intercepted by coniferous tree canopy had already been transported to the ground surface 4 years after the accident in the soil profile 137cs has been detected mainly in the top few centimeters of the soil layer kato et al 2012 matsunaga et al 2013 takahashi et al 2015 yoschenko et al 2016 the downward migration of 137cs in the soil layer was reported to be slow 1 cm y after the chernobyl accident arapis et al 1997 rosén et al 1999 generally 137cs that reaches the ground surface is rapidly adsorbed into the surface soil walling 1998 especially into frayed edge sites on clay minerals cremers et al 1988 after adsorption onto clay minerals 137cs is not readily leached from the soil under natural conditions yamashina and fukushi 2013 fukushi et al 2014 this suggests that soil acts as a 137cs filter adsorbing it but not readily releasing it conversely leaching of 137cs from organic material such as litter has been demonstrated in laboratory experiments sakai et al 2015 and field experiments using litterbags sakai et al 2016 subsequent transfer of 137cs from forests can occur via soil erosion in the particulate fraction and water flow via streams and rivers in the dissolved fraction the transport of 137cs via rivers has been studied mainly in the abukuma sakaguchi et al 2012 yasutaka et al 2012 yamashiki et al 2014 iwagami et al 2017a b niida ueda et al 2013 and ota tsuji et al 2016 rivers this combined riverine system broadly covers the northwest area of the contaminated region in fukushima most studies have concluded that 137cs transfer in rivers occurred mainly via suspended sediments sakaguchi et al 2012 ueda et al 2013 yamashiki et al 2014 iwagami et al 2017a in the headwater area iwagami et al 2017a showed a declining trend of dissolved 137cs in stream water during baseflow conditions the highest dissolved 137cs concentration recorded in iboishi yama was 1 2 bq l in august 2011 which declined to 0 021 bq l in april 2013 the dissolved 137cs concentration in groundwater was one order of magnitude lower than that in stream water iwagami et al 2017a they also reported a temporary increase in dissolved 137cs concentrations in stream water during rainstorm events however the process and source of this temporary increase are poorly understood after the chernobyl nuclear power plant accident the 137cs concentration in shallow groundwater decreased from approximately 8 bq l in 1989 to less than 0 1 bq l in 1999 in the red forest near the site of the accident international atomic energy agency 2006 contamination of subsurface water and transfer of dissolved 137cs by plant root uptake bunzl et al 1999 prorok et al 2006 is also of great concern in fukushima nakanishi et al 2014 investigated the vertical migration of 137cs through soil water by collecting seepage water using zero tension lysimeters they showed that concentrations of dissolved 137cs in soil water at depths of 0 05 and 0 1 m ranged from 0 005 to 0 025 bq l however the infiltration capacity of forest soil is generally high and rarely saturated e g freeze 1974 pearce et al 1986 sidle et al 2007 underlining the importance of collecting soil water using instruments that can collect water under unsaturated conditions such as suction lysimeters nishikiori et al 2015 and tsuji et al 2016 tried to measure dissolved 137cs in soil water using suction lysimeters however the dissolved 137cs concentration in seepage water was below the detection limit iwagami et al 2017c reported that the concentration of dissolved 137cs in soil water sampled using a suction lysimeter ranged from 0 32 to 2 5 bq l in 2011 2012 at depths of 0 1 0 5 m illustrating the potentially high impact of soil water at sites in yamakiya district however there is still little information on the dissolved 137cs concentration in subsurface water in fukushima since the fdnpp accident forested headwater catchments may act as a source area of dissolved 137cs for local river systems stream water usually originates from subsurface water but the source of dissolved 137cs in stream water is not clearly understood in particular the source of temporarily high dissolved 137cs in stream water remains unknown to clarify the source area and processes controlling dissolved 137cs in stream water in a forested headwater catchment dissolved 137cs concentrations in stream water and subsurface water i e soil water and groundwater must to be evaluated together therefore we performed stream water sampling and intensive multi point sampling of subsurface water and measured dissolved 137cs concentrations in a headwater catchment in yamakiya district fukushima japan 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area stream water and subsurface water samples were collected for dissolved 137cs concentration measurements at a small forested headwater catchment the setohachi yama catchment area 0 048 km2 100 forest composition 29 conifer 71 broadleaf in yamakiya district kawamata city fukushima prefecture japan fig 1 shows a map of the catchment and observation sites fig 2 shows the instrument locations along the slope in a cross section from the parshall flume p 37 35 n 140 42 e to sampling site b3 the catchment is located 35 km northwest of the fdnpp and the average deposition density of 137cs in the catchment area was 760 kbq m2 based on the third airborne survey mext 2011 the area surrounded by the dotted line fig 1 shows the area of coniferous forest where the majority of 137cs initially intercepted by the tree canopy had already been transported to the ground surface yoschenko et al 2016 the rest of the area is broadleaf forest the catchment is located in a temperate humid area and experiences a pacific coast climate with two major rainfall periods tsuyu season june july and typhoon season august september the elevation of the catchment is 558 672 m the mean air temperature during 2015 to 2016 was 10 2 c the mean annual precipitation and discharge amounts during 2015 2016 were 1322 mm and 743 mm respectively discharge rate 56 the catchment is located at the headwater of the abukuma river which is the major river in fukushima prefecture and is an important industrial and domestic water resource the water channel consists of a main stream and a tributary stream in the main stream the discharge rate under baseflow conditions during summer was approximately 1 4 l s which decreased to approximately 0 6 l s during winter whereas the maximum discharge rate was 18 2 l s 21 00 september 10 2015 in the tributary stream the discharge rate under baseflow conditions during summer was approximately 0 04 l s which decreased to almost 0 l s during winter whereas the maximum discharge rate was 8 9 l s 21 00 september 10 2015 in the tributary stream the spring point and zone with saturated surface soil fluctuated depending on moisture levels in the catchment fig 3 shows an image of surface runoff around b2 after heavy rainfall from a typhoon on september 11 2015 after a total of 298 mm rainfall over 5 days the maximum discharge rate of 8 9 l s 21 00 september 10 2015 was recorded however no image could be obtained as it was nighttime the following morning surface runoff was still observed with a discharge rate of 4 0 l s 08 10 september 11 2015 most of which was considered to be surface runoff fig 3b 2 2 sampling and observation stream water sampling was conducted in both the main and tributary streams however intense sampling of subsurface water was conducted mainly in the tributary stream because tracing the hydrological pathways of dissolved 137cs transport from the ridge to the valley through subsurface water flow was expected to be easier in the small tributary stream also reflecting the fluctuation of the saturated zone near the spring point we expected this sampling to capture the influence of litter 137cs leachate on the dissolved 137cs concentration in shallow soil the stream water and subsurface water were sampled from july 2015 to november 2016 stream water was sampled directly from the stream flow at the parshall flume takeuchi ironworks ltd saitama japan figs 1 and 2 at 3 4 month intervals during rainfall events stream water was sampled using an automated water sampler sigma sd900 hach co usa at 3 4 h intervals the water level in the stream was recorded using a water level recorder trutrack wt hr500 intech instruments ltd christchurch new zealand installed on a parshall flume in 10 min interval stream water discharge was calculated based on the relationship between water level and manually measured discharge several interval recording cameras tlc200 brinno taipei taiwan were installed along the slope and took photographs at 10 min intervals the photographs were taken mainly to capture the occurrence of surface flow a change in the color of the ground surface was recognized in the photographs however it was difficult to quantify the water content in the soil layer rainfall was measured in 0 2 mm increments with a tipping bucket rain gauge 7852 m davis ca usa throughfall was sampled at site r1 and r2 using a plastic bottle and funnel subsurface water sampling was conducted along the slope from ridge to valley at multiple points and depths in the tributary stream fig 2 the instrument setup used for subsurface water sampling is shown in fig 4 groundwater was sampled at seven boreholes diameter 6 cm three times on july 7 2015 september 26 2015 and november 22 2016 the upper part of the borehole was sealed with cement and the bottom had many slits for water intake fig 4a the structure of the boreholes was the same as that shown in fig 4 of iwagami et al 2017a boreholes with depths of 3 5 and 10 m were installed at sites b1 b1 3 b1 5 and b1 10 respectively and b2 b2 3 b2 5 and b2 10 respectively a borehole with a depth of 20 m was installed at site b3 b3 20 b1 was located 16 m upslope from the parshall flume b2 was located 38 m upslope from the parshall flume at the inflection point of the slope b3 was located 34 m upslope of b2 at the ridge the screening ranges of the boreholes at b1 3 b2 3 b1 5 b2 5 b1 10 b2 10 and b3 20 were 2 3 4 5 8 10 and 10 20 m respectively groundwater was sampled using a portable water pump dik 665a daiki rika kogyo ltd saitama japan during groundwater sampling care was taken not to contaminate the groundwater in the borehole with material from the surrounding environment fresh groundwater was collected after pooled water was pumped from the borehole which was distinguished by the change in water temperature and amount of water pumped out the groundwater level was monitored continuously at 10 min intervals using a water level recorder hobo co u20 001 01 tempcon instrumentation ltd arundel uk which was suspended by a wire rope inside each borehole saturated and unsaturated soil water were collected with a suction lysimeter sk 5218 sankei rika ltd tokyo japan and connected in a conical flask fig 4b the suction lysimeter consisted of a ceramic cup diameter 1 8 cm length 7 cm and a vinyl chloride pipe the flask was decompressed until 70 to 80 kpa using a hand pump dk 8390 daiki rika kogyo ltd saitama japan decompression and collection of soil water were conducted at approximately 1 2 month intervals however soil water sampling depended on the volume of water that could be collected a total of 1 2 l water was required to detect dissolved 137cs in the soil water in winter from mid december to the end of march soil water sampling was not possible because of the risk of flask freeze fracturing suction lysimeters were installed at three sites s1 s3 at depths of 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 m i e s1 0 1 m s1 0 3 m s2 0 1 m s2 0 3 m s3 0 1 m s3 0 3 m and s3 0 5 m s1 was located 4 m upstream from the parshall flume because the spring point existed consistently 4 5 m upstream of the parshall flume site s1 was situated in a nearly saturated or saturated zone throughout summer s2 was located 9 m upstream from the parshall flume the saturated zone approached s2 during the rainy season from july to september s3 was located 17 m upstream from the parshall flume at s3 suction lysimeters were installed 1 m from the channel not in the middle and s3 was in a comparatively dry area the saturated zone only reached s3 after heavy rainfalls such as those associated with typhoons when the saturated zone expands it may be easier to collect shallow soil water along the valley line of the tributary stream which is close to becoming surface flow without using a suction lysimeter therefore a zero tension lysimeter was installed fig 4c the zero tension lysimeter was located 14 m upstream of the parshall flume site z the zero tension lysimeter was hand made by cutting a polyethylene bottle 0 3 m 0 3 m 0 3 m and connecting it to a vinyl tube to drain the water it was installed at a depth of 0 15 m to collect soil water in the range of the ground surface to a depth of 0 15 m in addition a 15 mm mesh net was placed in the stream to trap coarse organic matter org such as leaves and branches carried by the stream flow leaves and branches were rinsed with stream water at the sampling point to remove sediment the trapped material was mixed well in a plastic tray and an aliquot of approximately 0 5 kg was sampled to measure 137cs concentrations in the laboratory suspended sediment ss was sampled using a time integrated ss sampler phillips et al 2000 through field trials phillips et al 2000 confirmed that the collected samples provided statistically representative values of the particle size and carbon content in ambient water based on weighted averages of ss concentration indicating that the properties of ss during a flooding event are predominantly reflected in sediments trapped by the time integrated ss sampler the ss sampler was set in the streambed together with a turbidity sensor analite turbidity probe 3000 ntu mcvan instruments mulgrave australia the unit for turbidity is the nephelometric turbidity unit ntu but the raw output of the turbidity sensor is obtained in millivolts mv we prepared standard solutions of 0 0 1 0 5 1 3 and 5 mg l turbid water a clear linear relationship was found between the concentrations of turbid water mg l and turbidity sensor response mv therefore the output of the turbidity sensor mv was converted to ss concentration mg l collection of org and ss was conducted at approximately 1 2 month intervals the configurations of the org sampling net and ss sampler along the stream were the same as those shown in iwagami et al 2017b 2 3 analysis of 137cs all water samples were collected in polyethylene bottles and filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane ha type millipore ma usa the 137cs concentrations were determined using a high purity n type germanium coaxial gamma ray detector gc4020 canberra industries inc ct usa coupled with an amplifier psc822 canberra industries inc ct usa and multichannel analyzer dsa1000 canberra industries inc ct usa the spectrometers were calibrated with γ ray certified reference material source no 752 69 containing 137cs from isotope products laboratories samples less than 1 l were concentrated by evaporation samples greater than 1 l were concentrated using the ammonium molybdophosphate amp cs compound method tanaka et al 2006 briefly a portion of amp powder was dissolved with 1 25 tetramethylammonium hydroxide tamapure aa to determine 133cs concentration as a yield tracer inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent 7700 agilent technologies ca usa was used to measure 133cs in the solubilized amp samples rhenium 10 ng ml was employed as an online internal standard the average chemical yield for all processes was 92 and the 137cs concentration was recalculated based on the chemical yield the physical decay of 137cs was corrected to the sampling date the org and ss samples were dried at 105 c in an oven for 24 h and finely crushed the 137cs concentrations were determined using a germanium gamma ray detector well type gcw2022s canberra industries inc ct usa coupled with an amplifier 6300 aptec toronto canada and multichannel analyzer dsa1000 canberra industries inc ct usa the measurement system was calibrated using standard gamma sources at different sample heights for 137cs concentrations analysis each sample was measured for less than 10 error count per net area count the physical decay of 137cs was corrected to the sampling date in the rest of the text concentrations of dissolved 137cs bq l are reported as 137cs x where x corresponds to the monitored sample type st for stream water gw for groundwater sw for soil water collected with the suction lysimeter z for shallow subsurface water collected with the zero tension lysimeter and tf for throughfall concentrations of 137cs bq kg are also reported as 137cs x where x corresponds to the monitored sample type org for coarse organic matter and ss for suspended sediment 3 results and discussion 3 1 dissolved 137cs concentration in stream water and subsurface water samples the dissolved 137cs concentrations of the water samples are summarized in fig 5 results from sites with less than five samples are shown as dots all others are shown in the boxplot to show all of the results at the same scale 137cs concentrations are shown in bq l however low 137cs concentrations in stream water soil water and groundwater are described in mbq l in the following text throughfall was sampled seven times average of three samples at the broadleaf forest site r1 and once average of nine samples at the coniferous forest site r2 the average 137cs tf was 0 57 bq l at r1 and 0 95 bq l at r2 the 137cs tf at r2 was included for reference as throughfall at r2 was sampled only once also due to the small area of the coniferous forest throughfall in the coniferous forest was considered to have small influence on stream water stream water was sampled 9 times under baseflow conditions and 26 times during rainstorm events the average 137cs st under baseflow conditions was 17 mbq l the average 137cs st during rainstorm events was 31 mbq l maximum 170 mbq l on july 15 2015 minimum 7 2 mbq l on august 22 2016 iwagami et al 2017a reported the 137cs st for three headwater catchments in yamakiya district from june 2011 to july 2013 and predicted a declining trend in 137cs st excluding rainfall events using a double exponential model using this model a 137cs st of 0 4 20 mbq l was estimated for july 2015 almost similar to the 137cs st results in this study the average 137cs z was 38 mbq l which was similar to but slightly higher than the average 137cs st during the rainstorm event the 137cs sw was higher at the lower part of the slope s1 the average 137cs sw at s1 was 81 mbq l at a depth of 0 1 m and 42 mbq l at a depth of 0 3 m the average 137cs sw at s2 was 36 mbq l at a depth of 0 1 m and 31 mbq l at a depth of 0 3 m the average 137cs sw at s3 was 36 mbq l at a depth of 0 1 m 40 mbq l at a depth of 0 3 m and 54 mbq l at a depth of 0 5 m there were no clear trends in the vertical profile of 137cs sw although lower locations closer to the spring had comparatively high 137cs concentrations the 137cs concentration in groundwater 137cs gw was lower than the other samples with an average 137cs gw of 0 93 mbq l there was little difference in 137cs gw between sampling locations and sampling depths therefore 137cs gw seemed to be unaffected by groundwater flow the 137cs org and 137cs ss are not shown together with the dissolved 137cs concentrations in water samples in fig 5 however if plotted as boxplots the 25th and 75th percentiles of 137cs org would be 2 8 103 bq kg and 6 0 103 bq kg respectively average 4 9 103 bq kg and those of 137cs ss would be 1 6 104 bq kg and 2 3 104 bq kg respectively average 2 0 104 bq kg 3 2 fluctuation of 137cs concentrations during the rainstorm event a rainstorm event observed on july 15 16 2015 event 1507 was the first major rainstorm event rainfall of more than 100 mm during the rainy season of 2015 we focused on this rainstorm event as a typical rainstorm event after a comparatively dry period during which the expanding range of the saturated area could be observed the time series of the dissolved 137cs concentration main and tributary streams during event 1507 are shown along with the rainfall turbidity 137cs org main stream and tributary stream 137cs ss main stream discharge main stream and tributary stream and groundwater levels at b1 3 5 and 10 in fig 6 the plots of 137cs org and 137cs ss show the timing of sampling in which the horizontal bars indicate the organic matter and suspended sediment sampling period fig 6b during event 1507 organic matter and suspended sediment were sampled five times at the main stream but organic matter was sampled only two times in the tributary stream because less organic matter was caught in the sampling net suspended sediment was not sampled in the tributary stream because the stream was too narrow to set up the sampler the blank period for the groundwater level was subtracted as error fig 6d three rainfall peaks were observed during event 1507 fig 6a a sudden intensive rainfall 16 mm observed on july 15 2015 and a rainfall with two peaks total of 85 mm observed on july 16 2015 the fluctuation in turbidity at the main stream showed three peaks which corresponded well with rainfall intensity fig 6b the 137cs ss at the main stream was in the order of 104 bq kg fig 6b which seemed to decrease gradually during the rainstorm event but showed no correlation with turbidity the 137cs org was in the order of 103 bq kg fig 6b and decreased during the course of the event in the main stream this might represent the leaching of 137cs from the organic samples during the rainstorm event but will require confirmation by laboratory experiments the time series of discharge showed a single peak corresponding to rainfall in both the main and tributary streams the baseflow rate before the rainfall start was approximately 1 5 l s and the peak discharge was 9 3 l s at the main stream the baseflow rate before rainfall began was nearly 0 l s in the tributary stream fig 5c in the tributary stream stream water started to flow after rainfall started and the peak discharge of 1 1 l s was observed 2 h after the peak discharge in the main stream before rainfall began the spring point was at s1 soil surface was dark brown around s2 and appeared wet but not saturated after the intensive rainfall on july 15 2015 the dark brown area reached s2 but there was no surface flow at 10 30 on july 16 2015 after the rainfall started the slope became very wet and the surface area around s2 appeared saturated around 12 00 on july 16 2015 surface flow emerged around s2 after 16 00 on july 16 2015 the saturated area with surface flow expanded to around s3 and b1 the surface flow and saturated area were no longer observed on the morning of july 17 2015 the maximum 137cs st values were 5 7 mbq l in the main stream and 16 mbq l in the tributary stream at 14 30 on july 15 2015 during the first intensive rainfall on july 16 2015 the 137cs st was comparatively high around the rainfall peak in both the main and tributary streams before the discharge peak then the 137cs st in both the main and tributary streams decreased to 1 9 mbq l in the main stream and 2 4 mbq l in the tributary stream at 22 00 on july 16 2015 the 137cs st in the main and tributary streams differed substantially at 14 30 on july 15 2015 during the first intensive rainfall but were similar during the rest of the period the groundwater level at b1 showed no response to the intensive rainfall on july 15 2015 but uniformly rose by 0 37 m on average in the afternoon of july 16 2015 fig 6d the discharge peak of stream water corresponded to a rise in groundwater level therefore the decrease in 137cs st might have been the result of dilution by groundwater similarly regarding the timing of the maximum 137cs st value 137cs st might have been less affected by groundwater dilution compared with the lower value of 137cs st after the groundwater level rose 3 3 distribution of dissolved 137cs along the transect the results for 137cs st 137cs z 137cs sw and 137cs gw were plotted on a cross section of the slope to visualize the distribution of dissolved 137cs in fig 7 fig 7a shows the results of samples of stream water and groundwater from july 7 2015 and soil water samples from june 23 to july 15 2015 the groundwater level and spring point 7 m upslope of the parshall flume are shown as they appeared on july 7 2015 the average 137cs gw was 1 1 mbq l and there were minimal differences among the sampling locations and sampling depths the surface soil water collected with the zero tension lysimeter is not shown because the zero tension lysimeter was not yet installed the 137cs st was 23 mbq l at the parshall flume the stream water was essentially groundwater that emerged at the crossing point of the groundwater level and ground surface however the 137cs gw was too low to explain the 137cs st further the 137cs sw results were higher than those of stream water the highest 137cs sw was observed at a depth of 0 1 m at s1 110 mbq l therefore 137cs st was likely derived mainly from soil water and diluted by groundwater fig 7b shows the results of stream water sampled on september 17 2015 groundwater samples sampled on september 26 2015 and soil water samples collected from august 27 to september 18 2015 the groundwater level and spring point are shown as they appeared on september 26 2015 and were at almost the same as those on july 7 2015 the spring point was observed to rise upslope near site b2 during heavy rainfall from a typhoon on september 9 10 2015 the 137cs st was 10 mbq l the average 137cs gw was 0 96 mbq l and the 137cs sw at a depth of 0 1 m at s1 was 95 mbq l similar to the results shown in fig 7a 137cs st was considered to be the result of the mixing of groundwater and soil water higher 137cs sw was observed more in samples lower on the slope s1 where the ground was more saturated than in samples collected on the upper slope where it was drier s2 s3 which may have been caused by 137cs in litter leachate comparatively high 137cs st and 137cs sw were observed during dry periods or at the beginning of the rainfall it has been suggested that dissolved 137cs from litter leachate is stored in the litter layer and shallow soil layer when it is unsaturated this could explain the high 137cs sw in the shallow soil layer which could act as the source of temporarily high 137cs st at the beginning of a rainstorm event especially after a comparatively dry period the 137cs tf was high compared with the 137cs st and 137cs sw therefore it was necessary to evaluate the influence of the 137cs tf on the 137cs st for example on september 17 18 2015 51 mm of rainfall were observed at the broadleaf site the 137cs tf was 26 33 mbq l and the 137cs st was 1 0 3 1 mbq l the total 137cs discharge by stream water was estimated to be 1200 bq the saturated area around the stream was estimated to be 8 m2 0 16 m upstream of the parshall flume 0 5 m wide assuming that all of the throughfall that fell in the saturated area was discharged the total 137cs of throughfall was estimated to be 120 bq thus the direct discharge of 137cs via throughfall was estimated to account for at most 10 of the 137cs discharged by stream water however most throughfall would infiltrate the soil layer and be unlikely to reach the stream therefore the influence of throughfall was considered negligible consequently the moderate 137cs st a few meters downstream of the spring point may have mainly been the result of the 137cs sw which was diluted by the 137cs gw the high 137cs sw may be derived from litter leachate in the shallow soil layer stored in the slope during rainstorm events the saturated area expands upward therefore a temporarily high 137cs st at the beginning of a rainstorm might be caused by the contribution of high 137cs sw stored in the shallow soil layer further studies are needed to evaluate the formation of 137cs st by mixing of 137cs sw and 137cs gw at the ratios obtained using other tracers such as inorganic ions and stable isotopes for instance sakakibara et al 2019 performed hydrograph separation and showed the compositions of soil water and groundwater in the stream water using chlorine ion and sulfur hexafluoride as tracers combining results with those of such studies could enable estimation of the source area of 137cs in the slope in greater detail 4 conclusions intense multi point sampling and analysis of dissolved 137cs concentrations in stream water soil water and groundwater were conducted to investigate the process controlling dissolved 137cs concentrations in stream water in a forested headwater catchment in yamakiya district fukushima prefecture approximately 35 km northwest of the fdnpp stream water and subsurface water sampling were conducted from july 2015 to november 2016 the average dissolved 137cs concentration in stream water during baseflow conditions was 17 mbq l whereas the concentration in stream water during rainstorm events was 31 mbq l maximum 170 mbq l on july 15 2015 a temporary increase in the dissolved 137cs concentration was observed in stream water at the beginning of rainfall events groundwater had low concentrations of dissolved 137cs average 0 93 mbq l which did not fluctuate during groundwater flow through the slope by contrast dissolved 137cs concentrations in soil water were high in particular high dissolved 137cs concentrations were observed in the downslope area average 81 mbq l near the spring point and during wet conditions consequently we speculate that dissolved 137cs in stream water is derived mainly from soil water and diluted by groundwater the high dissolved 137cs concentration in soil water was possibly derived from litter leachate and stored in the unsaturated shallow layer on the slope during rainstorm events the saturated area expands upward therefore temporarily high concentrations of dissolved 137cs in stream water at the beginning of a rainstorm might be caused by the release of dissolved 137cs stored in the shallow soil layer in general stream water comprises a mixture of soil water and groundwater however to verify that soil water has an important influence on the dissolved 137cs concentration in stream water the low impact of dissolved 137cs in groundwater must be confirmed acknowledgments this work was conducted as a commissioned study from the japan

6543,numerous studies have been conducted on 137cs transport in the environment in fukushima japan since the fukushima dai ichi nuclear power plant fdnpp accident many studies have monitored river and stream water and a declining trend in dissolved 137cs concentrations has been reported in addition temporary increases in dissolved 137cs concentrations have been observed during rainstorm events however the source and process of such temporary increases remain poorly understood to address these gaps in knowledge intense multi point sampling and analysis of dissolved 137cs in stream water soil water and groundwater were conducted in a forested headwater catchment in yamakiya district located 35 km northwest of the fdnpp from july 2015 to november 2016 the average dissolved 137cs concentration in stream water during baseflow conditions was 17 mbq l whereas the concentration during rainstorm events was 31 mbq l maximum 170 mbq l on july 15 2015 the dissolved 137cs concentration in groundwater average 0 93 mbq l was lower than that in stream water conversely high concentrations of dissolved 137cs in soil water were observed average 81 mbq l particularly at lower parts of the slope near the spring point and in wet conditions throughout summer consequently the dissolved 137cs concentrations in stream water were considered to be derived mainly from soil water and diluted by groundwater the high dissolved 137cs concentration in soil water may be derived from litter leachate in the shallow soil layer stored on the slope during rainstorm events the saturated area expands upward therefore the temporary increase in the dissolved 137cs concentration in stream water observed at the beginning of a rainstorm may be caused by the release of high levels of dissolved 137cs in soil water stored in the shallow soil layer keywords dissolved 137cs forested headwater catchment fukushima dai ichi nuclear power plant stream water subsurface water 1 introduction following the earthquake and tsunami disaster on march 11 2011 the fukushima dai ichi nuclear power plant fdnpp accident resulted in a substantial release of radionuclides into the environment subsequently a large forested area in northeast fukushima received local fallout of 0 3 1 0 mbq m2 137cs ministry of education culture sports science and technology mext 2011 studies of forested areas in fukushima have shown that radionuclides remained in the forest even 4 years after the accident for instance the 137cs distribution in forests from tree crowns to the forest floor was revealed by an aerial dose rate survey kato and onda 2014 and by monitoring the transfer of canopy intercepted 137cs to the forest floor by measuring throughfall stemflow and litterfall kato et al 2015 yoschenko et al 2016 yoschenko et al 2016 reported that the majority 74 of 137cs initially intercepted by coniferous tree canopy had already been transported to the ground surface 4 years after the accident in the soil profile 137cs has been detected mainly in the top few centimeters of the soil layer kato et al 2012 matsunaga et al 2013 takahashi et al 2015 yoschenko et al 2016 the downward migration of 137cs in the soil layer was reported to be slow 1 cm y after the chernobyl accident arapis et al 1997 rosén et al 1999 generally 137cs that reaches the ground surface is rapidly adsorbed into the surface soil walling 1998 especially into frayed edge sites on clay minerals cremers et al 1988 after adsorption onto clay minerals 137cs is not readily leached from the soil under natural conditions yamashina and fukushi 2013 fukushi et al 2014 this suggests that soil acts as a 137cs filter adsorbing it but not readily releasing it conversely leaching of 137cs from organic material such as litter has been demonstrated in laboratory experiments sakai et al 2015 and field experiments using litterbags sakai et al 2016 subsequent transfer of 137cs from forests can occur via soil erosion in the particulate fraction and water flow via streams and rivers in the dissolved fraction the transport of 137cs via rivers has been studied mainly in the abukuma sakaguchi et al 2012 yasutaka et al 2012 yamashiki et al 2014 iwagami et al 2017a b niida ueda et al 2013 and ota tsuji et al 2016 rivers this combined riverine system broadly covers the northwest area of the contaminated region in fukushima most studies have concluded that 137cs transfer in rivers occurred mainly via suspended sediments sakaguchi et al 2012 ueda et al 2013 yamashiki et al 2014 iwagami et al 2017a in the headwater area iwagami et al 2017a showed a declining trend of dissolved 137cs in stream water during baseflow conditions the highest dissolved 137cs concentration recorded in iboishi yama was 1 2 bq l in august 2011 which declined to 0 021 bq l in april 2013 the dissolved 137cs concentration in groundwater was one order of magnitude lower than that in stream water iwagami et al 2017a they also reported a temporary increase in dissolved 137cs concentrations in stream water during rainstorm events however the process and source of this temporary increase are poorly understood after the chernobyl nuclear power plant accident the 137cs concentration in shallow groundwater decreased from approximately 8 bq l in 1989 to less than 0 1 bq l in 1999 in the red forest near the site of the accident international atomic energy agency 2006 contamination of subsurface water and transfer of dissolved 137cs by plant root uptake bunzl et al 1999 prorok et al 2006 is also of great concern in fukushima nakanishi et al 2014 investigated the vertical migration of 137cs through soil water by collecting seepage water using zero tension lysimeters they showed that concentrations of dissolved 137cs in soil water at depths of 0 05 and 0 1 m ranged from 0 005 to 0 025 bq l however the infiltration capacity of forest soil is generally high and rarely saturated e g freeze 1974 pearce et al 1986 sidle et al 2007 underlining the importance of collecting soil water using instruments that can collect water under unsaturated conditions such as suction lysimeters nishikiori et al 2015 and tsuji et al 2016 tried to measure dissolved 137cs in soil water using suction lysimeters however the dissolved 137cs concentration in seepage water was below the detection limit iwagami et al 2017c reported that the concentration of dissolved 137cs in soil water sampled using a suction lysimeter ranged from 0 32 to 2 5 bq l in 2011 2012 at depths of 0 1 0 5 m illustrating the potentially high impact of soil water at sites in yamakiya district however there is still little information on the dissolved 137cs concentration in subsurface water in fukushima since the fdnpp accident forested headwater catchments may act as a source area of dissolved 137cs for local river systems stream water usually originates from subsurface water but the source of dissolved 137cs in stream water is not clearly understood in particular the source of temporarily high dissolved 137cs in stream water remains unknown to clarify the source area and processes controlling dissolved 137cs in stream water in a forested headwater catchment dissolved 137cs concentrations in stream water and subsurface water i e soil water and groundwater must to be evaluated together therefore we performed stream water sampling and intensive multi point sampling of subsurface water and measured dissolved 137cs concentrations in a headwater catchment in yamakiya district fukushima japan 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area stream water and subsurface water samples were collected for dissolved 137cs concentration measurements at a small forested headwater catchment the setohachi yama catchment area 0 048 km2 100 forest composition 29 conifer 71 broadleaf in yamakiya district kawamata city fukushima prefecture japan fig 1 shows a map of the catchment and observation sites fig 2 shows the instrument locations along the slope in a cross section from the parshall flume p 37 35 n 140 42 e to sampling site b3 the catchment is located 35 km northwest of the fdnpp and the average deposition density of 137cs in the catchment area was 760 kbq m2 based on the third airborne survey mext 2011 the area surrounded by the dotted line fig 1 shows the area of coniferous forest where the majority of 137cs initially intercepted by the tree canopy had already been transported to the ground surface yoschenko et al 2016 the rest of the area is broadleaf forest the catchment is located in a temperate humid area and experiences a pacific coast climate with two major rainfall periods tsuyu season june july and typhoon season august september the elevation of the catchment is 558 672 m the mean air temperature during 2015 to 2016 was 10 2 c the mean annual precipitation and discharge amounts during 2015 2016 were 1322 mm and 743 mm respectively discharge rate 56 the catchment is located at the headwater of the abukuma river which is the major river in fukushima prefecture and is an important industrial and domestic water resource the water channel consists of a main stream and a tributary stream in the main stream the discharge rate under baseflow conditions during summer was approximately 1 4 l s which decreased to approximately 0 6 l s during winter whereas the maximum discharge rate was 18 2 l s 21 00 september 10 2015 in the tributary stream the discharge rate under baseflow conditions during summer was approximately 0 04 l s which decreased to almost 0 l s during winter whereas the maximum discharge rate was 8 9 l s 21 00 september 10 2015 in the tributary stream the spring point and zone with saturated surface soil fluctuated depending on moisture levels in the catchment fig 3 shows an image of surface runoff around b2 after heavy rainfall from a typhoon on september 11 2015 after a total of 298 mm rainfall over 5 days the maximum discharge rate of 8 9 l s 21 00 september 10 2015 was recorded however no image could be obtained as it was nighttime the following morning surface runoff was still observed with a discharge rate of 4 0 l s 08 10 september 11 2015 most of which was considered to be surface runoff fig 3b 2 2 sampling and observation stream water sampling was conducted in both the main and tributary streams however intense sampling of subsurface water was conducted mainly in the tributary stream because tracing the hydrological pathways of dissolved 137cs transport from the ridge to the valley through subsurface water flow was expected to be easier in the small tributary stream also reflecting the fluctuation of the saturated zone near the spring point we expected this sampling to capture the influence of litter 137cs leachate on the dissolved 137cs concentration in shallow soil the stream water and subsurface water were sampled from july 2015 to november 2016 stream water was sampled directly from the stream flow at the parshall flume takeuchi ironworks ltd saitama japan figs 1 and 2 at 3 4 month intervals during rainfall events stream water was sampled using an automated water sampler sigma sd900 hach co usa at 3 4 h intervals the water level in the stream was recorded using a water level recorder trutrack wt hr500 intech instruments ltd christchurch new zealand installed on a parshall flume in 10 min interval stream water discharge was calculated based on the relationship between water level and manually measured discharge several interval recording cameras tlc200 brinno taipei taiwan were installed along the slope and took photographs at 10 min intervals the photographs were taken mainly to capture the occurrence of surface flow a change in the color of the ground surface was recognized in the photographs however it was difficult to quantify the water content in the soil layer rainfall was measured in 0 2 mm increments with a tipping bucket rain gauge 7852 m davis ca usa throughfall was sampled at site r1 and r2 using a plastic bottle and funnel subsurface water sampling was conducted along the slope from ridge to valley at multiple points and depths in the tributary stream fig 2 the instrument setup used for subsurface water sampling is shown in fig 4 groundwater was sampled at seven boreholes diameter 6 cm three times on july 7 2015 september 26 2015 and november 22 2016 the upper part of the borehole was sealed with cement and the bottom had many slits for water intake fig 4a the structure of the boreholes was the same as that shown in fig 4 of iwagami et al 2017a boreholes with depths of 3 5 and 10 m were installed at sites b1 b1 3 b1 5 and b1 10 respectively and b2 b2 3 b2 5 and b2 10 respectively a borehole with a depth of 20 m was installed at site b3 b3 20 b1 was located 16 m upslope from the parshall flume b2 was located 38 m upslope from the parshall flume at the inflection point of the slope b3 was located 34 m upslope of b2 at the ridge the screening ranges of the boreholes at b1 3 b2 3 b1 5 b2 5 b1 10 b2 10 and b3 20 were 2 3 4 5 8 10 and 10 20 m respectively groundwater was sampled using a portable water pump dik 665a daiki rika kogyo ltd saitama japan during groundwater sampling care was taken not to contaminate the groundwater in the borehole with material from the surrounding environment fresh groundwater was collected after pooled water was pumped from the borehole which was distinguished by the change in water temperature and amount of water pumped out the groundwater level was monitored continuously at 10 min intervals using a water level recorder hobo co u20 001 01 tempcon instrumentation ltd arundel uk which was suspended by a wire rope inside each borehole saturated and unsaturated soil water were collected with a suction lysimeter sk 5218 sankei rika ltd tokyo japan and connected in a conical flask fig 4b the suction lysimeter consisted of a ceramic cup diameter 1 8 cm length 7 cm and a vinyl chloride pipe the flask was decompressed until 70 to 80 kpa using a hand pump dk 8390 daiki rika kogyo ltd saitama japan decompression and collection of soil water were conducted at approximately 1 2 month intervals however soil water sampling depended on the volume of water that could be collected a total of 1 2 l water was required to detect dissolved 137cs in the soil water in winter from mid december to the end of march soil water sampling was not possible because of the risk of flask freeze fracturing suction lysimeters were installed at three sites s1 s3 at depths of 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 m i e s1 0 1 m s1 0 3 m s2 0 1 m s2 0 3 m s3 0 1 m s3 0 3 m and s3 0 5 m s1 was located 4 m upstream from the parshall flume because the spring point existed consistently 4 5 m upstream of the parshall flume site s1 was situated in a nearly saturated or saturated zone throughout summer s2 was located 9 m upstream from the parshall flume the saturated zone approached s2 during the rainy season from july to september s3 was located 17 m upstream from the parshall flume at s3 suction lysimeters were installed 1 m from the channel not in the middle and s3 was in a comparatively dry area the saturated zone only reached s3 after heavy rainfalls such as those associated with typhoons when the saturated zone expands it may be easier to collect shallow soil water along the valley line of the tributary stream which is close to becoming surface flow without using a suction lysimeter therefore a zero tension lysimeter was installed fig 4c the zero tension lysimeter was located 14 m upstream of the parshall flume site z the zero tension lysimeter was hand made by cutting a polyethylene bottle 0 3 m 0 3 m 0 3 m and connecting it to a vinyl tube to drain the water it was installed at a depth of 0 15 m to collect soil water in the range of the ground surface to a depth of 0 15 m in addition a 15 mm mesh net was placed in the stream to trap coarse organic matter org such as leaves and branches carried by the stream flow leaves and branches were rinsed with stream water at the sampling point to remove sediment the trapped material was mixed well in a plastic tray and an aliquot of approximately 0 5 kg was sampled to measure 137cs concentrations in the laboratory suspended sediment ss was sampled using a time integrated ss sampler phillips et al 2000 through field trials phillips et al 2000 confirmed that the collected samples provided statistically representative values of the particle size and carbon content in ambient water based on weighted averages of ss concentration indicating that the properties of ss during a flooding event are predominantly reflected in sediments trapped by the time integrated ss sampler the ss sampler was set in the streambed together with a turbidity sensor analite turbidity probe 3000 ntu mcvan instruments mulgrave australia the unit for turbidity is the nephelometric turbidity unit ntu but the raw output of the turbidity sensor is obtained in millivolts mv we prepared standard solutions of 0 0 1 0 5 1 3 and 5 mg l turbid water a clear linear relationship was found between the concentrations of turbid water mg l and turbidity sensor response mv therefore the output of the turbidity sensor mv was converted to ss concentration mg l collection of org and ss was conducted at approximately 1 2 month intervals the configurations of the org sampling net and ss sampler along the stream were the same as those shown in iwagami et al 2017b 2 3 analysis of 137cs all water samples were collected in polyethylene bottles and filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane ha type millipore ma usa the 137cs concentrations were determined using a high purity n type germanium coaxial gamma ray detector gc4020 canberra industries inc ct usa coupled with an amplifier psc822 canberra industries inc ct usa and multichannel analyzer dsa1000 canberra industries inc ct usa the spectrometers were calibrated with γ ray certified reference material source no 752 69 containing 137cs from isotope products laboratories samples less than 1 l were concentrated by evaporation samples greater than 1 l were concentrated using the ammonium molybdophosphate amp cs compound method tanaka et al 2006 briefly a portion of amp powder was dissolved with 1 25 tetramethylammonium hydroxide tamapure aa to determine 133cs concentration as a yield tracer inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent 7700 agilent technologies ca usa was used to measure 133cs in the solubilized amp samples rhenium 10 ng ml was employed as an online internal standard the average chemical yield for all processes was 92 and the 137cs concentration was recalculated based on the chemical yield the physical decay of 137cs was corrected to the sampling date the org and ss samples were dried at 105 c in an oven for 24 h and finely crushed the 137cs concentrations were determined using a germanium gamma ray detector well type gcw2022s canberra industries inc ct usa coupled with an amplifier 6300 aptec toronto canada and multichannel analyzer dsa1000 canberra industries inc ct usa the measurement system was calibrated using standard gamma sources at different sample heights for 137cs concentrations analysis each sample was measured for less than 10 error count per net area count the physical decay of 137cs was corrected to the sampling date in the rest of the text concentrations of dissolved 137cs bq l are reported as 137cs x where x corresponds to the monitored sample type st for stream water gw for groundwater sw for soil water collected with the suction lysimeter z for shallow subsurface water collected with the zero tension lysimeter and tf for throughfall concentrations of 137cs bq kg are also reported as 137cs x where x corresponds to the monitored sample type org for coarse organic matter and ss for suspended sediment 3 results and discussion 3 1 dissolved 137cs concentration in stream water and subsurface water samples the dissolved 137cs concentrations of the water samples are summarized in fig 5 results from sites with less than five samples are shown as dots all others are shown in the boxplot to show all of the results at the same scale 137cs concentrations are shown in bq l however low 137cs concentrations in stream water soil water and groundwater are described in mbq l in the following text throughfall was sampled seven times average of three samples at the broadleaf forest site r1 and once average of nine samples at the coniferous forest site r2 the average 137cs tf was 0 57 bq l at r1 and 0 95 bq l at r2 the 137cs tf at r2 was included for reference as throughfall at r2 was sampled only once also due to the small area of the coniferous forest throughfall in the coniferous forest was considered to have small influence on stream water stream water was sampled 9 times under baseflow conditions and 26 times during rainstorm events the average 137cs st under baseflow conditions was 17 mbq l the average 137cs st during rainstorm events was 31 mbq l maximum 170 mbq l on july 15 2015 minimum 7 2 mbq l on august 22 2016 iwagami et al 2017a reported the 137cs st for three headwater catchments in yamakiya district from june 2011 to july 2013 and predicted a declining trend in 137cs st excluding rainfall events using a double exponential model using this model a 137cs st of 0 4 20 mbq l was estimated for july 2015 almost similar to the 137cs st results in this study the average 137cs z was 38 mbq l which was similar to but slightly higher than the average 137cs st during the rainstorm event the 137cs sw was higher at the lower part of the slope s1 the average 137cs sw at s1 was 81 mbq l at a depth of 0 1 m and 42 mbq l at a depth of 0 3 m the average 137cs sw at s2 was 36 mbq l at a depth of 0 1 m and 31 mbq l at a depth of 0 3 m the average 137cs sw at s3 was 36 mbq l at a depth of 0 1 m 40 mbq l at a depth of 0 3 m and 54 mbq l at a depth of 0 5 m there were no clear trends in the vertical profile of 137cs sw although lower locations closer to the spring had comparatively high 137cs concentrations the 137cs concentration in groundwater 137cs gw was lower than the other samples with an average 137cs gw of 0 93 mbq l there was little difference in 137cs gw between sampling locations and sampling depths therefore 137cs gw seemed to be unaffected by groundwater flow the 137cs org and 137cs ss are not shown together with the dissolved 137cs concentrations in water samples in fig 5 however if plotted as boxplots the 25th and 75th percentiles of 137cs org would be 2 8 103 bq kg and 6 0 103 bq kg respectively average 4 9 103 bq kg and those of 137cs ss would be 1 6 104 bq kg and 2 3 104 bq kg respectively average 2 0 104 bq kg 3 2 fluctuation of 137cs concentrations during the rainstorm event a rainstorm event observed on july 15 16 2015 event 1507 was the first major rainstorm event rainfall of more than 100 mm during the rainy season of 2015 we focused on this rainstorm event as a typical rainstorm event after a comparatively dry period during which the expanding range of the saturated area could be observed the time series of the dissolved 137cs concentration main and tributary streams during event 1507 are shown along with the rainfall turbidity 137cs org main stream and tributary stream 137cs ss main stream discharge main stream and tributary stream and groundwater levels at b1 3 5 and 10 in fig 6 the plots of 137cs org and 137cs ss show the timing of sampling in which the horizontal bars indicate the organic matter and suspended sediment sampling period fig 6b during event 1507 organic matter and suspended sediment were sampled five times at the main stream but organic matter was sampled only two times in the tributary stream because less organic matter was caught in the sampling net suspended sediment was not sampled in the tributary stream because the stream was too narrow to set up the sampler the blank period for the groundwater level was subtracted as error fig 6d three rainfall peaks were observed during event 1507 fig 6a a sudden intensive rainfall 16 mm observed on july 15 2015 and a rainfall with two peaks total of 85 mm observed on july 16 2015 the fluctuation in turbidity at the main stream showed three peaks which corresponded well with rainfall intensity fig 6b the 137cs ss at the main stream was in the order of 104 bq kg fig 6b which seemed to decrease gradually during the rainstorm event but showed no correlation with turbidity the 137cs org was in the order of 103 bq kg fig 6b and decreased during the course of the event in the main stream this might represent the leaching of 137cs from the organic samples during the rainstorm event but will require confirmation by laboratory experiments the time series of discharge showed a single peak corresponding to rainfall in both the main and tributary streams the baseflow rate before the rainfall start was approximately 1 5 l s and the peak discharge was 9 3 l s at the main stream the baseflow rate before rainfall began was nearly 0 l s in the tributary stream fig 5c in the tributary stream stream water started to flow after rainfall started and the peak discharge of 1 1 l s was observed 2 h after the peak discharge in the main stream before rainfall began the spring point was at s1 soil surface was dark brown around s2 and appeared wet but not saturated after the intensive rainfall on july 15 2015 the dark brown area reached s2 but there was no surface flow at 10 30 on july 16 2015 after the rainfall started the slope became very wet and the surface area around s2 appeared saturated around 12 00 on july 16 2015 surface flow emerged around s2 after 16 00 on july 16 2015 the saturated area with surface flow expanded to around s3 and b1 the surface flow and saturated area were no longer observed on the morning of july 17 2015 the maximum 137cs st values were 5 7 mbq l in the main stream and 16 mbq l in the tributary stream at 14 30 on july 15 2015 during the first intensive rainfall on july 16 2015 the 137cs st was comparatively high around the rainfall peak in both the main and tributary streams before the discharge peak then the 137cs st in both the main and tributary streams decreased to 1 9 mbq l in the main stream and 2 4 mbq l in the tributary stream at 22 00 on july 16 2015 the 137cs st in the main and tributary streams differed substantially at 14 30 on july 15 2015 during the first intensive rainfall but were similar during the rest of the period the groundwater level at b1 showed no response to the intensive rainfall on july 15 2015 but uniformly rose by 0 37 m on average in the afternoon of july 16 2015 fig 6d the discharge peak of stream water corresponded to a rise in groundwater level therefore the decrease in 137cs st might have been the result of dilution by groundwater similarly regarding the timing of the maximum 137cs st value 137cs st might have been less affected by groundwater dilution compared with the lower value of 137cs st after the groundwater level rose 3 3 distribution of dissolved 137cs along the transect the results for 137cs st 137cs z 137cs sw and 137cs gw were plotted on a cross section of the slope to visualize the distribution of dissolved 137cs in fig 7 fig 7a shows the results of samples of stream water and groundwater from july 7 2015 and soil water samples from june 23 to july 15 2015 the groundwater level and spring point 7 m upslope of the parshall flume are shown as they appeared on july 7 2015 the average 137cs gw was 1 1 mbq l and there were minimal differences among the sampling locations and sampling depths the surface soil water collected with the zero tension lysimeter is not shown because the zero tension lysimeter was not yet installed the 137cs st was 23 mbq l at the parshall flume the stream water was essentially groundwater that emerged at the crossing point of the groundwater level and ground surface however the 137cs gw was too low to explain the 137cs st further the 137cs sw results were higher than those of stream water the highest 137cs sw was observed at a depth of 0 1 m at s1 110 mbq l therefore 137cs st was likely derived mainly from soil water and diluted by groundwater fig 7b shows the results of stream water sampled on september 17 2015 groundwater samples sampled on september 26 2015 and soil water samples collected from august 27 to september 18 2015 the groundwater level and spring point are shown as they appeared on september 26 2015 and were at almost the same as those on july 7 2015 the spring point was observed to rise upslope near site b2 during heavy rainfall from a typhoon on september 9 10 2015 the 137cs st was 10 mbq l the average 137cs gw was 0 96 mbq l and the 137cs sw at a depth of 0 1 m at s1 was 95 mbq l similar to the results shown in fig 7a 137cs st was considered to be the result of the mixing of groundwater and soil water higher 137cs sw was observed more in samples lower on the slope s1 where the ground was more saturated than in samples collected on the upper slope where it was drier s2 s3 which may have been caused by 137cs in litter leachate comparatively high 137cs st and 137cs sw were observed during dry periods or at the beginning of the rainfall it has been suggested that dissolved 137cs from litter leachate is stored in the litter layer and shallow soil layer when it is unsaturated this could explain the high 137cs sw in the shallow soil layer which could act as the source of temporarily high 137cs st at the beginning of a rainstorm event especially after a comparatively dry period the 137cs tf was high compared with the 137cs st and 137cs sw therefore it was necessary to evaluate the influence of the 137cs tf on the 137cs st for example on september 17 18 2015 51 mm of rainfall were observed at the broadleaf site the 137cs tf was 26 33 mbq l and the 137cs st was 1 0 3 1 mbq l the total 137cs discharge by stream water was estimated to be 1200 bq the saturated area around the stream was estimated to be 8 m2 0 16 m upstream of the parshall flume 0 5 m wide assuming that all of the throughfall that fell in the saturated area was discharged the total 137cs of throughfall was estimated to be 120 bq thus the direct discharge of 137cs via throughfall was estimated to account for at most 10 of the 137cs discharged by stream water however most throughfall would infiltrate the soil layer and be unlikely to reach the stream therefore the influence of throughfall was considered negligible consequently the moderate 137cs st a few meters downstream of the spring point may have mainly been the result of the 137cs sw which was diluted by the 137cs gw the high 137cs sw may be derived from litter leachate in the shallow soil layer stored in the slope during rainstorm events the saturated area expands upward therefore a temporarily high 137cs st at the beginning of a rainstorm might be caused by the contribution of high 137cs sw stored in the shallow soil layer further studies are needed to evaluate the formation of 137cs st by mixing of 137cs sw and 137cs gw at the ratios obtained using other tracers such as inorganic ions and stable isotopes for instance sakakibara et al 2019 performed hydrograph separation and showed the compositions of soil water and groundwater in the stream water using chlorine ion and sulfur hexafluoride as tracers combining results with those of such studies could enable estimation of the source area of 137cs in the slope in greater detail 4 conclusions intense multi point sampling and analysis of dissolved 137cs concentrations in stream water soil water and groundwater were conducted to investigate the process controlling dissolved 137cs concentrations in stream water in a forested headwater catchment in yamakiya district fukushima prefecture approximately 35 km northwest of the fdnpp stream water and subsurface water sampling were conducted from july 2015 to november 2016 the average dissolved 137cs concentration in stream water during baseflow conditions was 17 mbq l whereas the concentration in stream water during rainstorm events was 31 mbq l maximum 170 mbq l on july 15 2015 a temporary increase in the dissolved 137cs concentration was observed in stream water at the beginning of rainfall events groundwater had low concentrations of dissolved 137cs average 0 93 mbq l which did not fluctuate during groundwater flow through the slope by contrast dissolved 137cs concentrations in soil water were high in particular high dissolved 137cs concentrations were observed in the downslope area average 81 mbq l near the spring point and during wet conditions consequently we speculate that dissolved 137cs in stream water is derived mainly from soil water and diluted by groundwater the high dissolved 137cs concentration in soil water was possibly derived from litter leachate and stored in the unsaturated shallow layer on the slope during rainstorm events the saturated area expands upward therefore temporarily high concentrations of dissolved 137cs in stream water at the beginning of a rainstorm might be caused by the release of dissolved 137cs stored in the shallow soil layer in general stream water comprises a mixture of soil water and groundwater however to verify that soil water has an important influence on the dissolved 137cs concentration in stream water the low impact of dissolved 137cs in groundwater must be confirmed acknowledgments this work was conducted as a commissioned study from the japan

6544,many studies have analyzed historical trends in annual peak flows in the united states because of the importance of flooding to bridges and other structures and the concern that human influence may increase flooding to help attribute causes of historical peak flow changes it is important to separate basins by characteristics that have different influences on peak flows we analyzed historical trends by basin type minimally altered basins regulated basins substantial reservoir storage but low urbanization and urbanized basins with low reservoir storage although many peak flow magnitude changes were found in the last century across the conterminous united states the trend magnitude and direction vary strongly by basin type and region in general there was a low percentage of significant increases and decreases for minimally altered basins while many regulated basins had significant decreases and the limited number of urbanized basins with long term record showed a high percentage of increases for urbanized basins which are concentrated in the northeast and midwest trend magnitude was significantly correlated with the amount of basin urbanization for all basins regardless of type parts of the northeast quadrant of the u s had high concentrations of basins with large and significant increases while parts of the southwest quadrant had high concentrations of basins with large and significant decreases basin regulation appears to have heavily influenced the decreasing trends in the southwest quadrant there were many large decreases for this basin type despite overall increases in heavy precipitation in this area changes over time in the number of 2 per year and 1 per 5 year peaks over threshold are consistent with changes in the magnitude of annual peak flows keywords flood flows trends united states regulation urbanization 1 introduction floods caused the second highest number of weather related fatalities in the united states from 1940 through 2017 less than lightning strikes and more than tornadoes national weather service 2018 and flood damages averaged almost 8 billion dollars per year from 1985 through 2014 national weather service 2018 because of the importance of flooding in the u s and elsewhere and the concern that human influence may increase flooding many studies have analyzed historical trends in annual peak flows in the u s e g lins and slack 1999 douglas et al 2000 villarini et al 2009 vogel et al 2011 peterson et al 2013 ahn and palmer 2015 rice et al 2015 do et al 2017 archfield et al 2016 examined u s trends in peaks over threshold pots rather than annual peak flows these pots included more frequent floods than annual peaks and only included peaks above a selected magnitude structures in and near rivers such as bridges are designed to have long life spans many highway departments in the u s require these structures to safely convey large flows such as the 100 year return period peak flow mccuen et al 2002 design peak flows in the u s are computed based on historical annual peak flow data and a log pearson type iii distribution england et al 2018 it is important to know how peak flows have changed historically to help inform whether historical peak flows are likely to be representative of future ones alterations to drainage basins potentially affect riverine floods urbanization is known to increase peak flow magnitudes because of more impervious land cover and faster flood conveyance from channelization channel linings storm sewers and curb and gutter streets e g leopold 1968 hollis 1975 sauer et al 1983 the addition of major reservoirs typically lowers peak flow magnitudes because of added storage capacity and flood management e g williams and wolman 1984 magilligan and nislow 2005 graf 2006 fitzhugh and vogel 2011 peak flows may not continue to change in the future as they have in the past if basins are fully developed changes in factors that affect river flooding such as precipitation intensity duration and frequency antecedent soil moisture conditions and snowmelt runoff can result in higher or lower peak flows trenberth 2011 seneviratne et al 2012 whitfield 2012 do et al 2017 hodgkins et al 2017 the importance of the interaction among these factors is shown for the u s by ivancic and shaw 2015 where 99th percentile precipitation results in 99th percentile streamflow only 36 of the time to help attribute causes of historical peak flow changes it is important to separate basins by characteristics that have different influences on peak flows many peak flow trend studies have used basins with minimal human basin alterations to analyze the influence of climatic changes on peak flows lins and slack 1999 douglas et al 2000 peterson et al 2013 ahn and palmer 2015 other studies at the national scale have looked at basins with a combination of climatic and human influences villarini et al 2009 or have separated basins into minimally altered and altered ones vogel et al 2011 rice et al 2015 do et al 2017 no known u s study at the national scale has analyzed peak flow trends for basins with different types of human alteration while minimizing for other types this is important because some basin alterations can cause increased flood magnitudes while others can cause decreased magnitudes for the current study we analyze historical trends for all basins combined and also by basin type minimally altered basins regulated basins substantial reservoir storage but low urbanization and urbanized basins substantial urbanization but low reservoir storage we look at trends in the magnitude of annual peak flows and in the number of peaks over threshold that occur on average twice per year and ones that occur once in 5 years also we consider short and long term persistence in the interpretation of trends 2 data and methods 2 1 peak flow data this study uses both annual instantaneous peak flows and daily average peaks from a peaks over threshold pot approach applied to all appropriate u s geological survey usgs streamflow gages in the conterminous united states streamflow values through water year 2015 ending september 30 2015 were obtained from the usgs national water information system u s geological survey 2018 data were subject to length and completeness criteria to allow gages with long term data to have minor amounts of missing data but no large blocks for any one decade gages were required to have instantaneous peak data from 1966 to 2015 50 years and have values for at least 8 of 10 years 80 for each decade we also applied the 80 decadal completeness criteria to the periods 1941 2015 75 years and 1916 2015 100 years the number of qualifying gages for each period was 2681 1465 and 257 gages respectively daily mean streamflow values were used to compute time series of pots to analyze changes in pot occurrence over time this is a departure from the use of annual instantaneous peak flow series used in most analyses of flood trends instantaneous peaks are not generally available for the entire periods in this study for the pot thresholds used in some cases e g drought years the annual peak flow may not be large enough to be considered a flood it is simply the largest recorded flow for that year whereas pots by definition will only use floods above a set threshold the magnitudes of the peak daily flows that meet pot thresholds will be an underestimate of the annual instantaneous peak magnitude though it can be similar for larger basins the underestimation will be larger for basins with shorter lag times between rainfall and peaks such as small basins steep basins and basins with little storage in the current study we analyze pots at streamflow gages that average 2 events per year also analyzed by archfield et al 2016 but for only minimally altered gages and pots that average 1 event per 5 years the goal of the pot analysis was to choose a threshold for flood peaks that would result in pot series for floods that occurred more frequently and less frequently on average than the annual flood peaks this allows us to evaluate whether changes in the annual peaks are consistent with changes based on pots the 1 event per 5 year threshold was selected as a balance between having enough flood events over the period of record to analyze for trends and choosing a threshold that focused on flood events less frequent than the annual peaks the 2 events per year threshold was a balance between capturing large secondary annual floods that may have been discarded to create the annual series and preserving a series that was representative of actual floods two series of pot flood events at each streamflow gage were determined by setting streamflow thresholds resulting in an average of 2 events per year and 1 event per 5 years respectively for the base period 1941 1968 a base period was needed to determine the streamflow threshold corresponding to 1 event per 5 years and 2 events per year thresholds and to compare changes in the floods exceeding these thresholds this approach is consistent with work in the climate literature hansen et al 2012 that use a base period to compare past observed variability to a more recent period in assessing change the base period of 1941 1968 was specifically selected to be long enough to establish a sufficient baseline of pot flood series but spanning a time period and length of record assumed to have small changes or relatively unchanged flood conditions with which to compare to the more recent record each threshold was established through an iterative process using trial threshold values that were between the 0 001 and 0 2 exceedance probabilities on the daily base period flow duration curve for a given trial threshold value an initial set of flood events was defined as the set of continuous days for which streamflow was greater than the trial threshold if there was only one day separating flow values above the trial threshold those values were considered part of the same event if there was more than one day separating two flow values above the trial threshold criteria were established to determine if the intervening streamflow decreased enough for the two flow values to be considered part of different events for this determination the following information was used qp the peak streamflow of the preceding event qmin the lowest streamflow value observed between the two peaks and q0 9 the streamflow associated with the 0 9 exceedance probability on the daily base period flow duration curve the two flow values above the threshold were considered part of a single event if the difference between qp and qmin is less than the difference between 0 75 qp q0 9 q0 9 was used because streamflows at some gages never fell below 0 75qp archfield et al 2016 the result of this method is a series of flood events associated with a given trial value for the pots that average 2 events per year the flow threshold value selected for each gage was the value for which the average number of events per water year during the base period is the closest to an average of 2 events but within the range of 1 8 and 2 2 it was not always possible to obtain exactly 2 events per year finally the flow threshold at gages with an average number of events between 1 8 and 2 2 events was applied to the full 75 year period of streamflow record 1941 2015 to determine the series of flood events for each gage a parallel method was then used to compute flood series with an average of 1 event per 5 years it was required to have between 0 9 and 1 1 events per 5 years archfield et al 2016 found that for gages where a streamflow threshold value resulting in 2 events per year over the base period was not possible this result typically occurred at gages characterized by a flood record dominated by a single annual snowmelt event every year or at streams with exceptionally high baseflow in relation to total annual streamflow for the 1 event in 5 year threshold at some basins the search algorithm was not always able to locate a streamflow threshold resulting in a frequency of between 0 9 and 1 1 events per 5 years even though criteria were met at the same basins for the 2 events per year threshold gages for which the search algorithm did not find a threshold value meeting these criteria were removed from the analysis 154 gages did not meet the criteria for having an average of 1 event per 5 years over the base period and 71 gages did not meeting the criteria for having an average of 2 events per year over the base period therefore a different number of streamgages qualified for each pot analysis overall 1279 basins qualified for the 2 event per year threshold while 1178 basins qualified for the 1 event per 5 years threshold 2 2 isolating climate urbanization and regulation influences for basins to look separately at flood trends that may be related to climatic changes or to a combination of climatic changes and basin alterations we subdivided study gages into minimally altered regulated and urbanized categories because urbanization tends to increase peak flows and the addition of major reservoirs tends to reduce peak flows and thus the two influences may counteract each other we took steps described below to make sure our regulated basins had minimal urbanization and vice versa basins that did not qualify for the minimally altered regulated or urbanized categories were placed into an unclassified category all basins were categorized in the same way using recent basin data the categories do not vary by time period for the 50 75 and 100 year periods used basin attributes such as land cover were obtained from the geospatial attributes of gages for evaluating streamflow gages ii dataset falcone 2011 falcone et al 2010 the gages ii dataset contains several hundred climatological geological land cover water use hydraulic infrastructure and basin characteristics data for more than 9000 usgs gages among these characteristics the gages ii dataset identifies basins with streamflows considered to be least impacted by human disturbance the hydroclimatic data network 2009 lins 2012 basins with the hcdn 2009 designation are gages considered to be relatively free from human disturbance or alteration and are therefore affected primarily by climatic changes and variability reference gages these gages were used to represent climatic influences on peak flow trends in the u s the categorization of basins into regulated and urbanized types was done using normalized dam storage stor nid 2009 and the percent of developed land devnlcd06 the sum of land cover classes 21 22 23 and 24 respectively in the gages ii database these land cover values in gages ii are from the national land cover database 2006 fry et al 2011 urban land use is indicative of changes that can affect floods such as added impervious area and faster flood conveyance e g leopold 1968 hollis 1975 sauer et al 1983 we computed a flow based normalized dam storage value by first multiplying stor nid 2009 which is in units of volume per unit drainage area by basin drainage area yielding volume then dividing by 1966 2015 mean annual flow volume per day to yield normalized storage in days the 1966 2015 period was used to compute normalized storage with the longest record that all study basins had in common this flow based normalization of dam storage accounts for smaller reservoirs in drier areas having relatively more impact on streamflows a higher amount of storage relative to mean annual flow than similar sized reservoirs in wetter areas the data available for storage on a nationwide basis is total storage because the more relevant variable would be usable storage the amount of controllable storage we used a relative threshold for regulation to attempt to maximize regulation for the regulated basins and minimize regulation for the urbanized basins for our regulated basin category we used basins with normalized dam storage in the top 25 of dam storage for all basins in our study this amount of storage was chosen as a balance between creating a subset of basins with a high amount of storage while allowing a relatively large number of basins in the subset the top 25 of storage represents a normalized storage of 128 days the number of days of long term mean daily flow that is stored by the reservoir s in each basin regulated basins also were required to have less than 10 developed area devnlcd06 hollis 1975 found that 5 impervious area would not affect peak flows we assume that 10 developed area a mixture of impervious area and vegetation in a basin is unlikely to affect peak flows substantially for the resulting 527 regulated basins reservoir storage additions were largest in the 1960s over one third of current storage was added in this decade data from falcone et al 2011 the 1950s and 1970s had the next largest storage additions but each decade had less than half of the storage added in the 1960s basins in our urbanized category had more than 10 developed area and normalized dam storage in the lowest 25 of basins 1 5 days or less of normalized storage the urbanized category may include basins with development that is too low to affect peak flows basin categories dam storage developed land and other information for each basin are in dudley et al 2018 2 3 trend and correlation analysis the magnitudes of historical annual peak flow trends were computed with the sen slope a non parametric overall change metric that is resistant to outliers theil 1950 sen 1968 helsel and hirsch 1992 sen slope change per year was multiplied by the years of record for each period in this study to compute the magnitude of change the magnitude of change was converted to percent change relative to the sen line value at the start of the period using the sen slope and intercept computed using the zyp sen function of the zyp r package bronaugh and werner 2015 we computed trend significance with the mann kendall test mann 1945 and modifications that consider the possibility of short and long term persistence in the time series data the significance of hydroclimatic trends over time is sensitive to assumptions of whether time series data are independent have short term persistence stp or have long term persistence ltp cohn and lins 2005 koutsoyiannis and montanari 2007 hamed 2008 khaliq et al 2009 kumar et al 2009 hodgkins and dudley 2011 sagarika et al 2014 stp and ltp refer to distinct dependence structures in time series data in stp the autocorrelation decays exponentially or faster as a function of the time lag for ltp however the decay is slower than exponential data from an ltp process tend to cluster in time koutsoyiannis and montanari 2007 the causes of peak flow persistence are not well understood but may be related to ocean atmosphere oscillations hall et al 2014 sagarika et al 2014 which could lead to persistence of antecedent hydrologic conditions that are important to flood generation or persistence of synoptic scale and mesoscale patterns that influence heavy rainfall generating processes hodgkins et al 2017 as an example the occurrence of major floods for large 1000 km2 basins in north america was related to the atlantic multidecadal oscillation hodgkins et al 2017 the presence of persistence in a data series can lead to serious overestimation of the significance of trends if time series are assumed to be independent from year to year when they are not cohn and lins 2005 we report trend significance with three different assumptions about the serial structure of the time series data independence short term persistence and long term persistence hamed and rao 1998 hamed 2008 for a general mann kendall test using r code dudley et al 2018 all three versions of the mann kendall test use the same test statistics but the variance of these statistics depends on the dependence assumption the variance obtained with an independence assumption is inflated by a factor depending on the lag 1 autocorrelation coefficient for the stp version or on the hurst coefficient for the ltp version trend magnitude and significance for individual basins along with basin metadata are listed in dudley et al 2018 lag one autocorrelation was computed for the 1465 streamflow gages for the 1941 2015 period on detrended annual peak time series linear detrend with r pracma package borchers 2018 and is available for individual basins in dudley et al 2018 field significance was computed with the walker test approximation wilks 2006 the minimum local p value multiplied by the number of local trend tests when a trend test is repeated over many sites locally significant trends are expected to be found in a percentage of sites close to the error level of the test even when no trend exists a field significance procedure aims at determining whether this percentage is too large to be due to chance alone given that the test has been repeated many times in the context of our study local trend tests refer to peak flow trends at individual basins the walker test is robust to spatial correlation of local tests wilks 2006 significant trends based on monotonic tests may actually be due to change points villarini et al 2009 on the other hand significant change points may be due to monotonic trends the pettitt test a commonly used test for change points has been found to be sensitive to the presence of trends busuioc and von storch 1996 if both trends and change points are present analyzing only one can be misleading sharma et al 2016 change points across the united states are being analyzed in a parallel study to the current monotonic trends study poisson regression cameron and trivedi 2013 was used to compute changes in annual pot counts from 1941 to 2015 using the glm function in the r stats package r core team 2017 with family poisson link log the total change in pot counts per year from 1941 to 2015 was computed by subtracting the predicted average pot counts in 2015 and 1941 all correlations reported in the current article correspond to kendall s tau sen 1968 helsel and hirsch 1992 3 results there was a mix of increasing and decreasing trends in annual peak flow magnitude in the conterminous united states when considering all streamflow gages in the study with more decreases than increases table 1 fig 1 the number of significant p 0 05 decreases was about three times the number of significant increases for 1916 2015 257 gages with relatively complete data the proportion of increases to decreases varied when the gages were divided by basin type a relatively low percentage of minimally altered basins had significant peak flow increases 5 14 depending on the assumption for time series structure or decreases 5 10 while many regulated basins high regulation and low urbanization had significant decreases 44 56 and this group was strongly field significant p 0 0005 as expected based on previously published trend results that considered time series persistence e g cohn and lins 2005 hamed 2008 khaliq et al 2009 hodgkins 2013 more gages had significant trends under the assumption of independence and short term persistence than with the assumption that long term persistence is present in the time series for 1941 2015 1465 gages with 75 years of record there were more significant decreases overall 9 18 of gages than increases 5 12 table 1 fig 1 there were some significant increases for minimally altered basins 3 12 and few decreases 1 3 many regulated basins had decreases 25 45 and this group was strongly field significant while the limited number of urbanized basins with low regulation showed many increases 19 38 and this group was also strongly field significant for 1966 2015 2681 basins with 50 years of record less than 6 of minimally altered basins had significant increases or decreases and this group was not field significant p 0 05 some 8 24 of regulated basins had significant decreases and 8 28 of urban basins had significant increases the results in table 1 for unclassified stations are similar to results for all stations this makes sense as a large majority of stations do not meet our criteria for minimally altered regulated or urbanized basins the primary difference is that unclassified stations have a lower percentage of basins with significantly decreasing trends because many heavily regulated basins with significantly decreasing trends are in the regulated category the median change in annual peak flow magnitude for 1916 2015 for all minimally altered basins was an increase of 19 while the median change for regulated basins was a decrease of 38 fig 2 a for 1941 2015 the median change was 8 34 and 21 for minimally altered regulated and urbanized basins respectively fig 2b for 1966 2015 the median change for these basin types was 4 19 and 22 respectively fig 2c annual peak flow trend significance varied strongly by region in the u s fig 3 for all basins regardless of type there were many significant increases in parts of the northeastern and midwestern u s and many decreases in parts of the northeastern southeastern midwestern southcentral southwestern and west coastal u s overall geographic patterns in the magnitude of changes over time fig 4 were similar to patterns in the significance of trends there were many basins with increases greater than 75 in the northeastern quadrant of the u s and many basins with decreases greater than 75 in the southwestern quadrant for the 50 and 75 year periods annual peak flow trend magnitudes for different basin types for the 50 year period are mapped in fig 5 the changes in the peak magnitude of floods show both increases and decreases for minimally altered basins fig 5a including some large 75 decreases in the central u s from the dakotas to texas and some large increases in the midwest there were many large decreases in flood magnitude for regulated basins in the southwestern quadrant of the u s fig 5b and some large increases in the midwest and northeast a relatively high percentage of large increases are seen for urbanized basins a large majority of the limited number of urbanized basins with long term data are in the midwest and northeast fig 5c trends in the number of pot events per year between 1941 and 2015 are shown in fig 6 for two different pot thresholds a the threshold resulting in an average of two events per year and b the threshold resulting in an average of one event every five years daily mean peak flows were used for the computation of the pots the two per year pot events generally occur more frequently than annual peak flows the one per five year pots generally occur less frequently two per year pots showed a median total increase of 0 35 events year total for the entire period from 1941 to 2015 for minimally altered basins fig 6a regulated basins however showed a median decrease of 0 82 events year and urbanized basins showed a median increase of 1 09 events year for one per five year pots fig 6b there were median total changes of 0 05 0 17 and 0 45 events year for minimally altered regulated and urbanized basins respectively pot changes are mapped in fig 7 for the two per year pots fig 7a and the one per five year pots fig 7b there are many large increases in the number of events per year from 1941 to 2015 in parts of the northeast and midwest and many large decreases in the south central u s and on the west coast geographic patterns of trends over the last 75 years in the number of pots between recent and older decades fig 7 are consistent with the observed patterns in trends in the magnitude of annual peak flows fig 4b overall differences in trends over time between basin types over the last 75 years are also consistent for annual peak flow magnitudes and in the number of pots for minimally altered basins median peak flow magnitudes are up modestly fig 2b as are the median numbers of two per year floods fig 6a and one per five year floods fig 6b the limited number of urban basins show larger increases in both annual peak flow magnitudes and the number of two per year and five per year floods regulated basins on the other hand show median decreases in annual peak flow magnitude and the number of two per year and one per five year floods 4 discussion and conclusions 4 1 considering the effects of region basin type and basin size on peak flow trends although many annual peak flow magnitude changes were observed to occur in the last century across the conterminous united states the trend magnitude and direction varied strongly by basin type and region it is difficult to determine the factors behind peak flow changes if basins analyzed have a combination of influences which may work in opposing ways the separation of basins into minimally altered regulated with low urbanization and urbanized with low regulation helps define the influence of individual factors in general there was a low percentage of significant increases and decreases for minimally altered basins while regulated basins had many significant decreases and the few urbanized basins with low regulation showed a high percentage of increases table 1 fig 1 some of the difference in trends between basin types may be due to different concentrations for these basin types in different regions of the country fig 5a and b parts of the northeast quadrant of the u s had high concentrations of basins with large and significant increases while parts of the southwest quadrant had high concentrations of basins with large and significant decreases figs 3 and 4 a relatively high percentage of regulated basins in this study are in the southwest quadrant of the u s despite a potential for geographic bias affecting the overall regulated basin results in this study regulated basins appear to have heavily influenced the decreasing trends in the southwest quadrant there were many large decreases and many more decreases than increases for this basin type in this quadrant fig 5b which contrasts with average regional heavy precipitation 99th percentile increases of 10 12 in this same area from 1958 to 2016 easterling et al 2017 interestingly there were large increases in annual peak flow magnitude in parts of the midwest and northeast despite high amounts of regulation which would be expected to decrease peak flow magnitudes in general this is likely due to increased precipitation in these regions having more influence on peak flows than increases in reservoir storage 99th percentile precipitation increased from 1958 to 2016 in the northeast by 55 and in the midwest by 42 easterling et al 2017 many of the limited number of urbanized basins in this study are in the midwest and northeast fig 5c where large increases in heavy precipitation have been documented this leads to an overall bias toward peak flow increases for urbanized basins in our study however urbanized basins fig 5c have more medium and large increases 50 than nearby minimally altered basins fig 5a trend magnitude for all urbanized basins from 1966 to 2015 was correlated with the percent urbanization of basins there was a significant positive relation p 0 00076 τ 0 23 fig 8 increased peak flow trends due to increased urbanization are likely because of the increased impervious area and faster flow conveyance in urbanized areas however the minimum level of basin urbanization used for this study 10 may not be high enough to substantially affect peak flows based on the smooth line in fig 8 annual peak flow trends do not generally increase with increased urbanization until the percent developed area in a basin reaches at least 25 an important issue in hydrology is the interaction of climate variability basin changes and spatial scale on streamflows blöschl et al 2007 for example changes in convective storms are more important to floods for small basins and land use changes such as urbanization can be more concentrated in smaller basins hall et al 2014 viglione et al 2016 could results in the current study based on basin type actually be due to basin size in the united states the median basin size varies for different types of basins in our study minimally altered basins had a median drainage area of 394 km2 while regulated basins had a median of 3126 km2 and urbanized basins had a median of 90 km2 the percent change in annual peak flows for 1941 2015 for small 469 km2 medium 469 2036 km2 and large 2036 km2 drainage areas are shown in fig 9 the break points between size classes represent the 33 3 and 66 7 percentiles for basin size in our study small basin results fig 9a still break out by basin type as they did for all basin sizes lumped together fig 2b with a modest increase in the median change for minimally altered basins a decrease for regulated basins and a larger increase for urbanized basins than for minimally altered basins the same holds true for medium fig 9b and large basins fig 9c for minimally altered and regulated basins but there are almost no urbanized basins for these size classes thus annual peak flow magnitude trends still differ by basin type in our study regardless of size class 4 2 effects of persistence in peak flow data when ignored short and long term persistence in time series lead to the overestimation of trend significance e g helsel and hirsch 1992 cohn and lins 2005 hamed 2008 kumar et al 2009 sagarika et al 2014 it is difficult to prove the presence of long term persistence in streamflow time series vogel et al 1998 khaliq et al 2009 markonis et al 2018 however the lag one autocorrelation of the flood time series can provide some evaluation of the presence of persistence in floods what is not clear from lag one autocorrelation is the decay rate and whether the persistence is short term or long term significant p 0 05 lag one autocorrelation in annual peak flows was present at 7 8 of 1465 streamflow gages for the 1941 2015 period significant autocorrelation was present at 21 3 of regulated gages and 5 1 of gages with low amounts of basin alterations it appears that substantial amounts of reservoir storage introduce peak flow autocorrelation for many basins no urban gages indicated significant autocorrelation but there were only 21 gages for the 75 year period tested statistical persistence is therefore not a major factor for annual peak flow trends in the u s except for trend significance at regulated gages which may be overestimated if time series independence is assumed it is difficult to know whether the autocorrelation is indicative of short or long term persistence 4 3 comparison of results with previous studies we found similar geographic patterns in the magnitude and direction of annual peak flow trends for 1941 2015 including all basin types fig 4b as rice et al 2015 found for 1940 2009 such as areas of relatively large increases in the midwest and northeast we found however a concentration of large decreases in the south central u s that does not show up in rice et al 2015 this is likely driven by the very low peak flows at many gages in this area in the last 5 years geographic patterns in the two per year pot changes fig 7a are consistent with archfield et al 2016 with increases in the northeast midwest and western washington state and decreases in western oregon and northern california there is no known published work on trends in one per five year pots to compare our results to the relatively small percentage of minimally altered basins in the u s with significant annual peak flow trends in the past 50 100 years with both increases and decreases is consistent with recent studies that looked at minimally altered basins based on various criteria peterson et al 2013 ahn and palmer 2015 do et al 2017 no known previous peak flow studies at the national u s scale have looked at historical trends for basins with large amounts of storage regulation that have low amounts of urbanization or urbanized basins that have low regulation heavy precipitation has been increasing in the united states in recent decades easterling et al 2017 99th percentile precipitation trends from 1958 to 2016 ranged from 9 in the pacific northwest region to 55 in the northeast increases in the southeast midwest and great plains were all 25 despite these increases in heavy precipitation annual peak annual streamflows in the u s from 1966 to 2015 had a median decrease of 4 for 496 basins in the u s with minimal basin alterations fig 2c there were many peak flow increases in the northeast of 25 and a few 50 however there were also many increases 25 and many small decreases fig 5a the south central u s showed a 12 increase in the 99th percentile precipitation easterling et al 2017 but there were many small and large peak flow decreases for minimally altered basins in this region fig 5a it has become increasingly recognized in recent years that trends in heavy precipitation do not necessarily lead to changes in peak streamflows ivancic and shaw 2015 have an effective demonstration of this finding in their study 99th percentile precipitation resulted in 99th percentile peak flows only 36 of the time during wet soil moisture periods the percentage increased to 62 of the time demonstrating the importance of antecedent soil moisture for peak flow magnitudes antecedent soil moisture is affected by precipitation but the annual evapotranspiration cycle also plays an important role evapotranspiration is at a maximum during the warm growing season generally producing drier soil moisture conditions when compared with the cold dormant season when evapotranspiration is at a minimum wetter soil moisture conditions during the evapotranspiration minima make winter and early spring a flood prone period in humid climates which can be compounded in cold regions by contemporaneous snowmelt if increases in heavy precipitation happen during the warm season when soil moisture tends to be less this can produce a disconnect between trends in extreme precipitation and trends in peak streamflows small et al 2006 frei et al 2015 antecedent soil moisture can also be affected land use and land cover snowmelt runoff can also affect peak flows through direct runoff of water stored as snowpack it can change in ways that increase or decrease peak flows for example reduced snowpack can result in lower peak flows because of less snowmelt runoff or result in larger peak flows because of greater effective basin area from elevational snowline shifts as more rain falls at higher elevations rather than snow hamlet and lettenmaier 2007 4 4 importance of results for design flood flows historical trends in peak streamflows for different types of basins are critical for understanding how floods may change in the future and thus how hydraulic infrastructure such as bridges should be designed regulated basins with low urbanization unlike minimally altered basins showed many significant decreases over time likely related to the increased storage capacity when major reservoirs were installed this was true for annual peak flows however it might not be true for larger floods and particularly extreme floods as the relative storage capacity will be smaller historical trends in annual peak flows for urbanized basins with low regulation showed higher percentages of significant increases than for minimally altered basins however there were relatively few urbanized basins with long term data and they were largely in the northeast and midwest historical increases in peak flows at urbanized basins may not continue into the future if a basin has a current high degree of urbanization without much future potential for substantially increased amounts of impervious area or more hydraulic flood conveyance infrastructure increased flood storage in urban basins may also lower peak flow magnitudes selection of the appropriate historical record for computing design floods such as the 100 year flood for all basin types is very important but not always straightforward careful consideration of historical flood generating mechanisms and basin regulation and urbanization for individual basins will be crucial for determining the most appropriate design peak flows trends or abrupt changes in historical climate regulation and urbanization that are coincident with changes in peak flows will be useful for indicating factors behind peak flow changes traditional computation of design floods assumes that past peak flows are representative of future ones this is clearly not the case for many regulated and urbanized basins in the u s at these sites traditional design floods using all historical data may not generate results representative of future floods statistical methods applied to design flood computations such as nonstationary analyses lópez and francés 2013 may be useful for incorporating historical basin or climatic changes there is also a growing recognition that changes in the flood distribution during the lifetime of a structure for which a design flood is computed should be accounted for this requires defining design floods with respect to the probability of failure over the design life period rather than the traditional return period rootzén and katz 2013 read and vogel 2015 there is currently no consensus on the most appropriate method for considering changing peak flows in the computation of design floods but a well defined deterministic mechanism that explains changing peak flows should be identified prior to a nonstationary analysis salas et al 2018 declaration of interest none acknowledgments this work was funded by the federal highway administration through interagency agreement dtfh6116x30020 flood frequency estimation for hydraulic design this article substantially benefitted from the reviews of mathias collins and two anonymous reviewers 
6544,many studies have analyzed historical trends in annual peak flows in the united states because of the importance of flooding to bridges and other structures and the concern that human influence may increase flooding to help attribute causes of historical peak flow changes it is important to separate basins by characteristics that have different influences on peak flows we analyzed historical trends by basin type minimally altered basins regulated basins substantial reservoir storage but low urbanization and urbanized basins with low reservoir storage although many peak flow magnitude changes were found in the last century across the conterminous united states the trend magnitude and direction vary strongly by basin type and region in general there was a low percentage of significant increases and decreases for minimally altered basins while many regulated basins had significant decreases and the limited number of urbanized basins with long term record showed a high percentage of increases for urbanized basins which are concentrated in the northeast and midwest trend magnitude was significantly correlated with the amount of basin urbanization for all basins regardless of type parts of the northeast quadrant of the u s had high concentrations of basins with large and significant increases while parts of the southwest quadrant had high concentrations of basins with large and significant decreases basin regulation appears to have heavily influenced the decreasing trends in the southwest quadrant there were many large decreases for this basin type despite overall increases in heavy precipitation in this area changes over time in the number of 2 per year and 1 per 5 year peaks over threshold are consistent with changes in the magnitude of annual peak flows keywords flood flows trends united states regulation urbanization 1 introduction floods caused the second highest number of weather related fatalities in the united states from 1940 through 2017 less than lightning strikes and more than tornadoes national weather service 2018 and flood damages averaged almost 8 billion dollars per year from 1985 through 2014 national weather service 2018 because of the importance of flooding in the u s and elsewhere and the concern that human influence may increase flooding many studies have analyzed historical trends in annual peak flows in the u s e g lins and slack 1999 douglas et al 2000 villarini et al 2009 vogel et al 2011 peterson et al 2013 ahn and palmer 2015 rice et al 2015 do et al 2017 archfield et al 2016 examined u s trends in peaks over threshold pots rather than annual peak flows these pots included more frequent floods than annual peaks and only included peaks above a selected magnitude structures in and near rivers such as bridges are designed to have long life spans many highway departments in the u s require these structures to safely convey large flows such as the 100 year return period peak flow mccuen et al 2002 design peak flows in the u s are computed based on historical annual peak flow data and a log pearson type iii distribution england et al 2018 it is important to know how peak flows have changed historically to help inform whether historical peak flows are likely to be representative of future ones alterations to drainage basins potentially affect riverine floods urbanization is known to increase peak flow magnitudes because of more impervious land cover and faster flood conveyance from channelization channel linings storm sewers and curb and gutter streets e g leopold 1968 hollis 1975 sauer et al 1983 the addition of major reservoirs typically lowers peak flow magnitudes because of added storage capacity and flood management e g williams and wolman 1984 magilligan and nislow 2005 graf 2006 fitzhugh and vogel 2011 peak flows may not continue to change in the future as they have in the past if basins are fully developed changes in factors that affect river flooding such as precipitation intensity duration and frequency antecedent soil moisture conditions and snowmelt runoff can result in higher or lower peak flows trenberth 2011 seneviratne et al 2012 whitfield 2012 do et al 2017 hodgkins et al 2017 the importance of the interaction among these factors is shown for the u s by ivancic and shaw 2015 where 99th percentile precipitation results in 99th percentile streamflow only 36 of the time to help attribute causes of historical peak flow changes it is important to separate basins by characteristics that have different influences on peak flows many peak flow trend studies have used basins with minimal human basin alterations to analyze the influence of climatic changes on peak flows lins and slack 1999 douglas et al 2000 peterson et al 2013 ahn and palmer 2015 other studies at the national scale have looked at basins with a combination of climatic and human influences villarini et al 2009 or have separated basins into minimally altered and altered ones vogel et al 2011 rice et al 2015 do et al 2017 no known u s study at the national scale has analyzed peak flow trends for basins with different types of human alteration while minimizing for other types this is important because some basin alterations can cause increased flood magnitudes while others can cause decreased magnitudes for the current study we analyze historical trends for all basins combined and also by basin type minimally altered basins regulated basins substantial reservoir storage but low urbanization and urbanized basins substantial urbanization but low reservoir storage we look at trends in the magnitude of annual peak flows and in the number of peaks over threshold that occur on average twice per year and ones that occur once in 5 years also we consider short and long term persistence in the interpretation of trends 2 data and methods 2 1 peak flow data this study uses both annual instantaneous peak flows and daily average peaks from a peaks over threshold pot approach applied to all appropriate u s geological survey usgs streamflow gages in the conterminous united states streamflow values through water year 2015 ending september 30 2015 were obtained from the usgs national water information system u s geological survey 2018 data were subject to length and completeness criteria to allow gages with long term data to have minor amounts of missing data but no large blocks for any one decade gages were required to have instantaneous peak data from 1966 to 2015 50 years and have values for at least 8 of 10 years 80 for each decade we also applied the 80 decadal completeness criteria to the periods 1941 2015 75 years and 1916 2015 100 years the number of qualifying gages for each period was 2681 1465 and 257 gages respectively daily mean streamflow values were used to compute time series of pots to analyze changes in pot occurrence over time this is a departure from the use of annual instantaneous peak flow series used in most analyses of flood trends instantaneous peaks are not generally available for the entire periods in this study for the pot thresholds used in some cases e g drought years the annual peak flow may not be large enough to be considered a flood it is simply the largest recorded flow for that year whereas pots by definition will only use floods above a set threshold the magnitudes of the peak daily flows that meet pot thresholds will be an underestimate of the annual instantaneous peak magnitude though it can be similar for larger basins the underestimation will be larger for basins with shorter lag times between rainfall and peaks such as small basins steep basins and basins with little storage in the current study we analyze pots at streamflow gages that average 2 events per year also analyzed by archfield et al 2016 but for only minimally altered gages and pots that average 1 event per 5 years the goal of the pot analysis was to choose a threshold for flood peaks that would result in pot series for floods that occurred more frequently and less frequently on average than the annual flood peaks this allows us to evaluate whether changes in the annual peaks are consistent with changes based on pots the 1 event per 5 year threshold was selected as a balance between having enough flood events over the period of record to analyze for trends and choosing a threshold that focused on flood events less frequent than the annual peaks the 2 events per year threshold was a balance between capturing large secondary annual floods that may have been discarded to create the annual series and preserving a series that was representative of actual floods two series of pot flood events at each streamflow gage were determined by setting streamflow thresholds resulting in an average of 2 events per year and 1 event per 5 years respectively for the base period 1941 1968 a base period was needed to determine the streamflow threshold corresponding to 1 event per 5 years and 2 events per year thresholds and to compare changes in the floods exceeding these thresholds this approach is consistent with work in the climate literature hansen et al 2012 that use a base period to compare past observed variability to a more recent period in assessing change the base period of 1941 1968 was specifically selected to be long enough to establish a sufficient baseline of pot flood series but spanning a time period and length of record assumed to have small changes or relatively unchanged flood conditions with which to compare to the more recent record each threshold was established through an iterative process using trial threshold values that were between the 0 001 and 0 2 exceedance probabilities on the daily base period flow duration curve for a given trial threshold value an initial set of flood events was defined as the set of continuous days for which streamflow was greater than the trial threshold if there was only one day separating flow values above the trial threshold those values were considered part of the same event if there was more than one day separating two flow values above the trial threshold criteria were established to determine if the intervening streamflow decreased enough for the two flow values to be considered part of different events for this determination the following information was used qp the peak streamflow of the preceding event qmin the lowest streamflow value observed between the two peaks and q0 9 the streamflow associated with the 0 9 exceedance probability on the daily base period flow duration curve the two flow values above the threshold were considered part of a single event if the difference between qp and qmin is less than the difference between 0 75 qp q0 9 q0 9 was used because streamflows at some gages never fell below 0 75qp archfield et al 2016 the result of this method is a series of flood events associated with a given trial value for the pots that average 2 events per year the flow threshold value selected for each gage was the value for which the average number of events per water year during the base period is the closest to an average of 2 events but within the range of 1 8 and 2 2 it was not always possible to obtain exactly 2 events per year finally the flow threshold at gages with an average number of events between 1 8 and 2 2 events was applied to the full 75 year period of streamflow record 1941 2015 to determine the series of flood events for each gage a parallel method was then used to compute flood series with an average of 1 event per 5 years it was required to have between 0 9 and 1 1 events per 5 years archfield et al 2016 found that for gages where a streamflow threshold value resulting in 2 events per year over the base period was not possible this result typically occurred at gages characterized by a flood record dominated by a single annual snowmelt event every year or at streams with exceptionally high baseflow in relation to total annual streamflow for the 1 event in 5 year threshold at some basins the search algorithm was not always able to locate a streamflow threshold resulting in a frequency of between 0 9 and 1 1 events per 5 years even though criteria were met at the same basins for the 2 events per year threshold gages for which the search algorithm did not find a threshold value meeting these criteria were removed from the analysis 154 gages did not meet the criteria for having an average of 1 event per 5 years over the base period and 71 gages did not meeting the criteria for having an average of 2 events per year over the base period therefore a different number of streamgages qualified for each pot analysis overall 1279 basins qualified for the 2 event per year threshold while 1178 basins qualified for the 1 event per 5 years threshold 2 2 isolating climate urbanization and regulation influences for basins to look separately at flood trends that may be related to climatic changes or to a combination of climatic changes and basin alterations we subdivided study gages into minimally altered regulated and urbanized categories because urbanization tends to increase peak flows and the addition of major reservoirs tends to reduce peak flows and thus the two influences may counteract each other we took steps described below to make sure our regulated basins had minimal urbanization and vice versa basins that did not qualify for the minimally altered regulated or urbanized categories were placed into an unclassified category all basins were categorized in the same way using recent basin data the categories do not vary by time period for the 50 75 and 100 year periods used basin attributes such as land cover were obtained from the geospatial attributes of gages for evaluating streamflow gages ii dataset falcone 2011 falcone et al 2010 the gages ii dataset contains several hundred climatological geological land cover water use hydraulic infrastructure and basin characteristics data for more than 9000 usgs gages among these characteristics the gages ii dataset identifies basins with streamflows considered to be least impacted by human disturbance the hydroclimatic data network 2009 lins 2012 basins with the hcdn 2009 designation are gages considered to be relatively free from human disturbance or alteration and are therefore affected primarily by climatic changes and variability reference gages these gages were used to represent climatic influences on peak flow trends in the u s the categorization of basins into regulated and urbanized types was done using normalized dam storage stor nid 2009 and the percent of developed land devnlcd06 the sum of land cover classes 21 22 23 and 24 respectively in the gages ii database these land cover values in gages ii are from the national land cover database 2006 fry et al 2011 urban land use is indicative of changes that can affect floods such as added impervious area and faster flood conveyance e g leopold 1968 hollis 1975 sauer et al 1983 we computed a flow based normalized dam storage value by first multiplying stor nid 2009 which is in units of volume per unit drainage area by basin drainage area yielding volume then dividing by 1966 2015 mean annual flow volume per day to yield normalized storage in days the 1966 2015 period was used to compute normalized storage with the longest record that all study basins had in common this flow based normalization of dam storage accounts for smaller reservoirs in drier areas having relatively more impact on streamflows a higher amount of storage relative to mean annual flow than similar sized reservoirs in wetter areas the data available for storage on a nationwide basis is total storage because the more relevant variable would be usable storage the amount of controllable storage we used a relative threshold for regulation to attempt to maximize regulation for the regulated basins and minimize regulation for the urbanized basins for our regulated basin category we used basins with normalized dam storage in the top 25 of dam storage for all basins in our study this amount of storage was chosen as a balance between creating a subset of basins with a high amount of storage while allowing a relatively large number of basins in the subset the top 25 of storage represents a normalized storage of 128 days the number of days of long term mean daily flow that is stored by the reservoir s in each basin regulated basins also were required to have less than 10 developed area devnlcd06 hollis 1975 found that 5 impervious area would not affect peak flows we assume that 10 developed area a mixture of impervious area and vegetation in a basin is unlikely to affect peak flows substantially for the resulting 527 regulated basins reservoir storage additions were largest in the 1960s over one third of current storage was added in this decade data from falcone et al 2011 the 1950s and 1970s had the next largest storage additions but each decade had less than half of the storage added in the 1960s basins in our urbanized category had more than 10 developed area and normalized dam storage in the lowest 25 of basins 1 5 days or less of normalized storage the urbanized category may include basins with development that is too low to affect peak flows basin categories dam storage developed land and other information for each basin are in dudley et al 2018 2 3 trend and correlation analysis the magnitudes of historical annual peak flow trends were computed with the sen slope a non parametric overall change metric that is resistant to outliers theil 1950 sen 1968 helsel and hirsch 1992 sen slope change per year was multiplied by the years of record for each period in this study to compute the magnitude of change the magnitude of change was converted to percent change relative to the sen line value at the start of the period using the sen slope and intercept computed using the zyp sen function of the zyp r package bronaugh and werner 2015 we computed trend significance with the mann kendall test mann 1945 and modifications that consider the possibility of short and long term persistence in the time series data the significance of hydroclimatic trends over time is sensitive to assumptions of whether time series data are independent have short term persistence stp or have long term persistence ltp cohn and lins 2005 koutsoyiannis and montanari 2007 hamed 2008 khaliq et al 2009 kumar et al 2009 hodgkins and dudley 2011 sagarika et al 2014 stp and ltp refer to distinct dependence structures in time series data in stp the autocorrelation decays exponentially or faster as a function of the time lag for ltp however the decay is slower than exponential data from an ltp process tend to cluster in time koutsoyiannis and montanari 2007 the causes of peak flow persistence are not well understood but may be related to ocean atmosphere oscillations hall et al 2014 sagarika et al 2014 which could lead to persistence of antecedent hydrologic conditions that are important to flood generation or persistence of synoptic scale and mesoscale patterns that influence heavy rainfall generating processes hodgkins et al 2017 as an example the occurrence of major floods for large 1000 km2 basins in north america was related to the atlantic multidecadal oscillation hodgkins et al 2017 the presence of persistence in a data series can lead to serious overestimation of the significance of trends if time series are assumed to be independent from year to year when they are not cohn and lins 2005 we report trend significance with three different assumptions about the serial structure of the time series data independence short term persistence and long term persistence hamed and rao 1998 hamed 2008 for a general mann kendall test using r code dudley et al 2018 all three versions of the mann kendall test use the same test statistics but the variance of these statistics depends on the dependence assumption the variance obtained with an independence assumption is inflated by a factor depending on the lag 1 autocorrelation coefficient for the stp version or on the hurst coefficient for the ltp version trend magnitude and significance for individual basins along with basin metadata are listed in dudley et al 2018 lag one autocorrelation was computed for the 1465 streamflow gages for the 1941 2015 period on detrended annual peak time series linear detrend with r pracma package borchers 2018 and is available for individual basins in dudley et al 2018 field significance was computed with the walker test approximation wilks 2006 the minimum local p value multiplied by the number of local trend tests when a trend test is repeated over many sites locally significant trends are expected to be found in a percentage of sites close to the error level of the test even when no trend exists a field significance procedure aims at determining whether this percentage is too large to be due to chance alone given that the test has been repeated many times in the context of our study local trend tests refer to peak flow trends at individual basins the walker test is robust to spatial correlation of local tests wilks 2006 significant trends based on monotonic tests may actually be due to change points villarini et al 2009 on the other hand significant change points may be due to monotonic trends the pettitt test a commonly used test for change points has been found to be sensitive to the presence of trends busuioc and von storch 1996 if both trends and change points are present analyzing only one can be misleading sharma et al 2016 change points across the united states are being analyzed in a parallel study to the current monotonic trends study poisson regression cameron and trivedi 2013 was used to compute changes in annual pot counts from 1941 to 2015 using the glm function in the r stats package r core team 2017 with family poisson link log the total change in pot counts per year from 1941 to 2015 was computed by subtracting the predicted average pot counts in 2015 and 1941 all correlations reported in the current article correspond to kendall s tau sen 1968 helsel and hirsch 1992 3 results there was a mix of increasing and decreasing trends in annual peak flow magnitude in the conterminous united states when considering all streamflow gages in the study with more decreases than increases table 1 fig 1 the number of significant p 0 05 decreases was about three times the number of significant increases for 1916 2015 257 gages with relatively complete data the proportion of increases to decreases varied when the gages were divided by basin type a relatively low percentage of minimally altered basins had significant peak flow increases 5 14 depending on the assumption for time series structure or decreases 5 10 while many regulated basins high regulation and low urbanization had significant decreases 44 56 and this group was strongly field significant p 0 0005 as expected based on previously published trend results that considered time series persistence e g cohn and lins 2005 hamed 2008 khaliq et al 2009 hodgkins 2013 more gages had significant trends under the assumption of independence and short term persistence than with the assumption that long term persistence is present in the time series for 1941 2015 1465 gages with 75 years of record there were more significant decreases overall 9 18 of gages than increases 5 12 table 1 fig 1 there were some significant increases for minimally altered basins 3 12 and few decreases 1 3 many regulated basins had decreases 25 45 and this group was strongly field significant while the limited number of urbanized basins with low regulation showed many increases 19 38 and this group was also strongly field significant for 1966 2015 2681 basins with 50 years of record less than 6 of minimally altered basins had significant increases or decreases and this group was not field significant p 0 05 some 8 24 of regulated basins had significant decreases and 8 28 of urban basins had significant increases the results in table 1 for unclassified stations are similar to results for all stations this makes sense as a large majority of stations do not meet our criteria for minimally altered regulated or urbanized basins the primary difference is that unclassified stations have a lower percentage of basins with significantly decreasing trends because many heavily regulated basins with significantly decreasing trends are in the regulated category the median change in annual peak flow magnitude for 1916 2015 for all minimally altered basins was an increase of 19 while the median change for regulated basins was a decrease of 38 fig 2 a for 1941 2015 the median change was 8 34 and 21 for minimally altered regulated and urbanized basins respectively fig 2b for 1966 2015 the median change for these basin types was 4 19 and 22 respectively fig 2c annual peak flow trend significance varied strongly by region in the u s fig 3 for all basins regardless of type there were many significant increases in parts of the northeastern and midwestern u s and many decreases in parts of the northeastern southeastern midwestern southcentral southwestern and west coastal u s overall geographic patterns in the magnitude of changes over time fig 4 were similar to patterns in the significance of trends there were many basins with increases greater than 75 in the northeastern quadrant of the u s and many basins with decreases greater than 75 in the southwestern quadrant for the 50 and 75 year periods annual peak flow trend magnitudes for different basin types for the 50 year period are mapped in fig 5 the changes in the peak magnitude of floods show both increases and decreases for minimally altered basins fig 5a including some large 75 decreases in the central u s from the dakotas to texas and some large increases in the midwest there were many large decreases in flood magnitude for regulated basins in the southwestern quadrant of the u s fig 5b and some large increases in the midwest and northeast a relatively high percentage of large increases are seen for urbanized basins a large majority of the limited number of urbanized basins with long term data are in the midwest and northeast fig 5c trends in the number of pot events per year between 1941 and 2015 are shown in fig 6 for two different pot thresholds a the threshold resulting in an average of two events per year and b the threshold resulting in an average of one event every five years daily mean peak flows were used for the computation of the pots the two per year pot events generally occur more frequently than annual peak flows the one per five year pots generally occur less frequently two per year pots showed a median total increase of 0 35 events year total for the entire period from 1941 to 2015 for minimally altered basins fig 6a regulated basins however showed a median decrease of 0 82 events year and urbanized basins showed a median increase of 1 09 events year for one per five year pots fig 6b there were median total changes of 0 05 0 17 and 0 45 events year for minimally altered regulated and urbanized basins respectively pot changes are mapped in fig 7 for the two per year pots fig 7a and the one per five year pots fig 7b there are many large increases in the number of events per year from 1941 to 2015 in parts of the northeast and midwest and many large decreases in the south central u s and on the west coast geographic patterns of trends over the last 75 years in the number of pots between recent and older decades fig 7 are consistent with the observed patterns in trends in the magnitude of annual peak flows fig 4b overall differences in trends over time between basin types over the last 75 years are also consistent for annual peak flow magnitudes and in the number of pots for minimally altered basins median peak flow magnitudes are up modestly fig 2b as are the median numbers of two per year floods fig 6a and one per five year floods fig 6b the limited number of urban basins show larger increases in both annual peak flow magnitudes and the number of two per year and five per year floods regulated basins on the other hand show median decreases in annual peak flow magnitude and the number of two per year and one per five year floods 4 discussion and conclusions 4 1 considering the effects of region basin type and basin size on peak flow trends although many annual peak flow magnitude changes were observed to occur in the last century across the conterminous united states the trend magnitude and direction varied strongly by basin type and region it is difficult to determine the factors behind peak flow changes if basins analyzed have a combination of influences which may work in opposing ways the separation of basins into minimally altered regulated with low urbanization and urbanized with low regulation helps define the influence of individual factors in general there was a low percentage of significant increases and decreases for minimally altered basins while regulated basins had many significant decreases and the few urbanized basins with low regulation showed a high percentage of increases table 1 fig 1 some of the difference in trends between basin types may be due to different concentrations for these basin types in different regions of the country fig 5a and b parts of the northeast quadrant of the u s had high concentrations of basins with large and significant increases while parts of the southwest quadrant had high concentrations of basins with large and significant decreases figs 3 and 4 a relatively high percentage of regulated basins in this study are in the southwest quadrant of the u s despite a potential for geographic bias affecting the overall regulated basin results in this study regulated basins appear to have heavily influenced the decreasing trends in the southwest quadrant there were many large decreases and many more decreases than increases for this basin type in this quadrant fig 5b which contrasts with average regional heavy precipitation 99th percentile increases of 10 12 in this same area from 1958 to 2016 easterling et al 2017 interestingly there were large increases in annual peak flow magnitude in parts of the midwest and northeast despite high amounts of regulation which would be expected to decrease peak flow magnitudes in general this is likely due to increased precipitation in these regions having more influence on peak flows than increases in reservoir storage 99th percentile precipitation increased from 1958 to 2016 in the northeast by 55 and in the midwest by 42 easterling et al 2017 many of the limited number of urbanized basins in this study are in the midwest and northeast fig 5c where large increases in heavy precipitation have been documented this leads to an overall bias toward peak flow increases for urbanized basins in our study however urbanized basins fig 5c have more medium and large increases 50 than nearby minimally altered basins fig 5a trend magnitude for all urbanized basins from 1966 to 2015 was correlated with the percent urbanization of basins there was a significant positive relation p 0 00076 τ 0 23 fig 8 increased peak flow trends due to increased urbanization are likely because of the increased impervious area and faster flow conveyance in urbanized areas however the minimum level of basin urbanization used for this study 10 may not be high enough to substantially affect peak flows based on the smooth line in fig 8 annual peak flow trends do not generally increase with increased urbanization until the percent developed area in a basin reaches at least 25 an important issue in hydrology is the interaction of climate variability basin changes and spatial scale on streamflows blöschl et al 2007 for example changes in convective storms are more important to floods for small basins and land use changes such as urbanization can be more concentrated in smaller basins hall et al 2014 viglione et al 2016 could results in the current study based on basin type actually be due to basin size in the united states the median basin size varies for different types of basins in our study minimally altered basins had a median drainage area of 394 km2 while regulated basins had a median of 3126 km2 and urbanized basins had a median of 90 km2 the percent change in annual peak flows for 1941 2015 for small 469 km2 medium 469 2036 km2 and large 2036 km2 drainage areas are shown in fig 9 the break points between size classes represent the 33 3 and 66 7 percentiles for basin size in our study small basin results fig 9a still break out by basin type as they did for all basin sizes lumped together fig 2b with a modest increase in the median change for minimally altered basins a decrease for regulated basins and a larger increase for urbanized basins than for minimally altered basins the same holds true for medium fig 9b and large basins fig 9c for minimally altered and regulated basins but there are almost no urbanized basins for these size classes thus annual peak flow magnitude trends still differ by basin type in our study regardless of size class 4 2 effects of persistence in peak flow data when ignored short and long term persistence in time series lead to the overestimation of trend significance e g helsel and hirsch 1992 cohn and lins 2005 hamed 2008 kumar et al 2009 sagarika et al 2014 it is difficult to prove the presence of long term persistence in streamflow time series vogel et al 1998 khaliq et al 2009 markonis et al 2018 however the lag one autocorrelation of the flood time series can provide some evaluation of the presence of persistence in floods what is not clear from lag one autocorrelation is the decay rate and whether the persistence is short term or long term significant p 0 05 lag one autocorrelation in annual peak flows was present at 7 8 of 1465 streamflow gages for the 1941 2015 period significant autocorrelation was present at 21 3 of regulated gages and 5 1 of gages with low amounts of basin alterations it appears that substantial amounts of reservoir storage introduce peak flow autocorrelation for many basins no urban gages indicated significant autocorrelation but there were only 21 gages for the 75 year period tested statistical persistence is therefore not a major factor for annual peak flow trends in the u s except for trend significance at regulated gages which may be overestimated if time series independence is assumed it is difficult to know whether the autocorrelation is indicative of short or long term persistence 4 3 comparison of results with previous studies we found similar geographic patterns in the magnitude and direction of annual peak flow trends for 1941 2015 including all basin types fig 4b as rice et al 2015 found for 1940 2009 such as areas of relatively large increases in the midwest and northeast we found however a concentration of large decreases in the south central u s that does not show up in rice et al 2015 this is likely driven by the very low peak flows at many gages in this area in the last 5 years geographic patterns in the two per year pot changes fig 7a are consistent with archfield et al 2016 with increases in the northeast midwest and western washington state and decreases in western oregon and northern california there is no known published work on trends in one per five year pots to compare our results to the relatively small percentage of minimally altered basins in the u s with significant annual peak flow trends in the past 50 100 years with both increases and decreases is consistent with recent studies that looked at minimally altered basins based on various criteria peterson et al 2013 ahn and palmer 2015 do et al 2017 no known previous peak flow studies at the national u s scale have looked at historical trends for basins with large amounts of storage regulation that have low amounts of urbanization or urbanized basins that have low regulation heavy precipitation has been increasing in the united states in recent decades easterling et al 2017 99th percentile precipitation trends from 1958 to 2016 ranged from 9 in the pacific northwest region to 55 in the northeast increases in the southeast midwest and great plains were all 25 despite these increases in heavy precipitation annual peak annual streamflows in the u s from 1966 to 2015 had a median decrease of 4 for 496 basins in the u s with minimal basin alterations fig 2c there were many peak flow increases in the northeast of 25 and a few 50 however there were also many increases 25 and many small decreases fig 5a the south central u s showed a 12 increase in the 99th percentile precipitation easterling et al 2017 but there were many small and large peak flow decreases for minimally altered basins in this region fig 5a it has become increasingly recognized in recent years that trends in heavy precipitation do not necessarily lead to changes in peak streamflows ivancic and shaw 2015 have an effective demonstration of this finding in their study 99th percentile precipitation resulted in 99th percentile peak flows only 36 of the time during wet soil moisture periods the percentage increased to 62 of the time demonstrating the importance of antecedent soil moisture for peak flow magnitudes antecedent soil moisture is affected by precipitation but the annual evapotranspiration cycle also plays an important role evapotranspiration is at a maximum during the warm growing season generally producing drier soil moisture conditions when compared with the cold dormant season when evapotranspiration is at a minimum wetter soil moisture conditions during the evapotranspiration minima make winter and early spring a flood prone period in humid climates which can be compounded in cold regions by contemporaneous snowmelt if increases in heavy precipitation happen during the warm season when soil moisture tends to be less this can produce a disconnect between trends in extreme precipitation and trends in peak streamflows small et al 2006 frei et al 2015 antecedent soil moisture can also be affected land use and land cover snowmelt runoff can also affect peak flows through direct runoff of water stored as snowpack it can change in ways that increase or decrease peak flows for example reduced snowpack can result in lower peak flows because of less snowmelt runoff or result in larger peak flows because of greater effective basin area from elevational snowline shifts as more rain falls at higher elevations rather than snow hamlet and lettenmaier 2007 4 4 importance of results for design flood flows historical trends in peak streamflows for different types of basins are critical for understanding how floods may change in the future and thus how hydraulic infrastructure such as bridges should be designed regulated basins with low urbanization unlike minimally altered basins showed many significant decreases over time likely related to the increased storage capacity when major reservoirs were installed this was true for annual peak flows however it might not be true for larger floods and particularly extreme floods as the relative storage capacity will be smaller historical trends in annual peak flows for urbanized basins with low regulation showed higher percentages of significant increases than for minimally altered basins however there were relatively few urbanized basins with long term data and they were largely in the northeast and midwest historical increases in peak flows at urbanized basins may not continue into the future if a basin has a current high degree of urbanization without much future potential for substantially increased amounts of impervious area or more hydraulic flood conveyance infrastructure increased flood storage in urban basins may also lower peak flow magnitudes selection of the appropriate historical record for computing design floods such as the 100 year flood for all basin types is very important but not always straightforward careful consideration of historical flood generating mechanisms and basin regulation and urbanization for individual basins will be crucial for determining the most appropriate design peak flows trends or abrupt changes in historical climate regulation and urbanization that are coincident with changes in peak flows will be useful for indicating factors behind peak flow changes traditional computation of design floods assumes that past peak flows are representative of future ones this is clearly not the case for many regulated and urbanized basins in the u s at these sites traditional design floods using all historical data may not generate results representative of future floods statistical methods applied to design flood computations such as nonstationary analyses lópez and francés 2013 may be useful for incorporating historical basin or climatic changes there is also a growing recognition that changes in the flood distribution during the lifetime of a structure for which a design flood is computed should be accounted for this requires defining design floods with respect to the probability of failure over the design life period rather than the traditional return period rootzén and katz 2013 read and vogel 2015 there is currently no consensus on the most appropriate method for considering changing peak flows in the computation of design floods but a well defined deterministic mechanism that explains changing peak flows should be identified prior to a nonstationary analysis salas et al 2018 declaration of interest none acknowledgments this work was funded by the federal highway administration through interagency agreement dtfh6116x30020 flood
