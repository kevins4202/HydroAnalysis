13270,polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and substituted pahs spahs are commonly persistent organic pollutants that are found in different industrial and agricultural wastewaters in the present research study we investigated the purification of coking wastewater containing mixed 16 pahs and 18 spahs using cuo decorated montmorillonite cuo m under solar light for better removal efficiency h2o2 was added to make the photo fenton reaction into action due to the complexity of this coking wastewater the purification was carried out in two runs the results showed that by using cuo m h2o2 light 66 of the total yield of pahs and spahs was removed from coking wastewater within 4 h the second treatment run led to a further increase in the removal rate up to 91 of total pollution different synergetic mechanistic pathways such as the adsorb shuttle process generation of reactive oxygen species ross by photoactive cuo on the montmorillonite surface and photo fenton ross generation in bulk water catalyzed by cuo and h2o2 are responsible for the effective removal of pahs and spahs even though the study was established under well controlled lab conditions we should say that the cuo m h2o2 light system showed excellent performance in removing a significant part of pah and spah compounds that might make it a potential alternative cooperative to be involved in wastewater treatment plant

introduction water pollution has long been considered as the main risk factor for the environment and human health in recent decades due to the huge industrial activities water pollution by different toxic persistence compounds got out of control in many countries 1 3 in particular coking wastewaters are polluted with high concentrations of harmful organic pollutants including phenols polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs substituted pahs spahs btex etc 4 6 since most of these chemicals are refractory carcinogenic and mutagenic the pollution generated through coking wastewaters is a severe concern to the scientific and industrial community particularly in developing countries the existence of pahs and spahs has gained great scientific interest due to them being among the most carcinogenic mutagenic and toxic pollutants in the environment 4 7 8 earlier studies demonstrated that coking wastewater contains significant quantities of high molecular weight hmw spahs and pahs in the coking wastewater and sludge 5 9 pahs and spahs are typically resistant to biological degradation and are ineffectively removed by traditional physio chemical techniques such as flocculation sedimentation filtering or ozonation 10 11 adsorption and advanced oxidation processes are major approaches for reducing pahs and spahs pollution in the environment which have long been a hot topic in scientific studies 12 15 given its simple operations non existent secondary by products and the cost effectiveness of investment and maintenance the adsorption technique for aqueous pahs and spahs pollution control is environmentally friendly and comparatively economic 16 17 several studies have been reported on the treatment of coking wastewater by the use of different technologies such as electrochemical peroxidation process 18 adsorption combined with uv photocatalysis and electrochemical 19 photocatalysis over ce ti graphene 20 photocatalysis fenton over a fe g c3n4 graphene hydrogel 3d structure 21 photocatalysis fenton over fe doped g c3n4 22 photocatalysis fenton over rgh fe g c3n4 tio2 photocatalytic synergized with ultrasonic 23 photocatalysis over reduced graphene oxide polyaniline 24 combined photocatalytic adsorption using n ce tio2 and modified inferior coal char 25 and combined electrocoagulation with photo fenton 26 as mentioned above most recent studies have investigated the treatment of coking wastewater using combined systems due to the complexity of such wastewaters among them photocatalysis has attracted a lot of attention from the scientific community as an advanced oxidation process photocatalysis has been used widely to oxidize persistence organic pollutants via the photogenerated reactive oxygen species 27 however this green approach has recently received criticism due to many technological factors and misconducting of research studies ignoring the photocatalytic tests in quasi similar actual conditions 28 29 in fact some studies have investigated the photocatalytic oxidation of mixed pahs in water 30 32 the main drawbacks of using naked photocatalytic nanoparticles are the low removal speed generation of by products due to the low adsorption ability toxicity of nanoparticles in treated waters and so on djellabi et al 33 recently have critically discussed the significant strengths and weaknesses of photocatalytic technology the authors reported that the scientific community has mostly addressed the removal of single pollutants i e dyes which are far from the real conditions further investigations to purify waters and wastewaters containing a high yield of multi pollutants should be addressed to help transfer of this technology to real application 34 combining sorbing materials and photocatalytic nanoparticles on the same platform is fascinating to solve common issues found in a single process 35 36 the sorbing area can concentrate the pollutants near the photoactive area allowing the photogenerated reactive oxygen species ross to promote the surface oxidation reaction through the so called adsorb shuttle process 37 this process speeds up the overall removal and photooxidation processes and allows the continuous cleaning of the adsorbent surface several adsorbents could be used alternatively to cost effective commercial activated carbon out of which clays have been proved to be very effective as adsorbents and also can amazingly immobilize photocatalytic nanoparticles e g montmorillonite 36 bai et al 38 reported that the combination of tio2 with graphene significantly enhances the removal of pahs from water due to the synergistic effects between adsorption and photocatalysis as mentioned above photocatalysis has recently received a lot of criticism because of its rare practice in the real world the present research study is devoted to investigating a real case of coking wastewater purification which was recovered from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp after biological treatment this wastewater is expected to be subjected to multi stage advanced oxidation before discharging into the environment the accurate evaluation of photocatalysis technology should be carried out compared to the existing technologies used for similar stages photocatalysis could be used during tertiary treatment in wwtps cuo montmorillonite based materials have been found to be effective for photo catalytic or and adsorption of different pollutants such as mercury 39 40 lead 41 microorganisms 42 44 anthracene 40 dyes 45 46 monocrotophos 47 sulfur mustard 48 and dichlorvos 49 in the present study the photocatalytic system in terms of cuo montmorillonite h2o2 solar light was used to treat coking wastewater which contains 34 mixed pahs and spahs toxic compounds control experiments including dark adsorption photolysis and photocatalysis were carried out separately to understand the mechanistic pathways 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and sampling the individual standards of 18 spahs including 9 mpahs 5 npahs and 4 opahs were obtained from tokyo chemical industry tci american accustandard company dr ehrenstorfer augsburg germany and toronto research chemicals inc trc at the same time the 16 priority pah chemicals were acquired from ehrenstorfer augsburg germany the surrogate standard naphthalene d8 was obtained from dr ehrenstorfer augsburg germany wastewater samples were taken from the biologically treated effluent of a coking wwtp in northern china this wwtp receives the discharge of the local coking factory which indicates that the chemical composition of the biological effluent is quite complex wastewater samples were collected in glass containers kept in the icebox and then taken directly to the lab for analysis and treatment the coking wastewater characterization was provided in our previous study 4 2 2 synthesis and characterization of cuo montmorillonite the synthesis of cuo montmorillonite cuo m was carried out by in situ precipitation of cuo on the surface of montmorillonite briefly cuso4 5h2o solution 1 m was dropped on a water montmorillonite mixture and stirring at 80 c then naoh solution 1 m was dropped and the mixture was kept under stirring for 4 h the obtained solid was washed several times by water in an ultrasonic bath finally the solid was calcined at 200 c for 2 h sem image of bare montmorillonite was recorded on scanning electron microscopy feg leo 1525 zeiss company germany thermogravimetry differential thermal analysis tg on cuo m from 25 to 500 c was tested using a thermogravimetric analyzer

infrared spectroscopy analyses ft ir on bare m and cuo m were recorded on nicolet iz10 ft ir spectrometer thermo fisher scientific 2 3 analytical methods the initial evaluation of the biological effluent wastewater was determined by chemical oxygen demand cod and dissolved organic carbon doc analysis however once the optimum conditions were established the untreated field sample and treated wastewater samples were analyzed for determining pahs and spahs concentration using headspace solid phase microextraction hs spme as described by saber et al 4 in brief 10 ml of wastewater sample containing the surrogate at 0 5 μg ml 1 was placed in an 18 mm vial with adding 2 6 g of sodium chloride then the vials were sealed with a septum cap and pre heated at 65 c 3 min afterward a 75 μm carboxen polydimethylsiloxane car pdms fiber was placed into the vial headspace and the extraction was carried out at 65 c for 25 min the target pahs and spahs in the extracts were analyzed using a gc

into the gc ms injection port and desorbed at 290 c for 10 min in splitless mode the oven temperature program was as follows 40 c 5 min 10 c min 1 to 210 c 1 min 12 c min 1 to 300 c 10 min the mass detector conditions for samples were ion source temperature 250 c ms interface line 260 c ionization mode electron impact at 70 ev 3 results and discussion montmorillonite is a layer of structured clay with excellent porosity and external surface area as discussed in our previous studies it has a high cation exchange capacity and swelling property facilitating its functionalization with metal oxides 36 37 fig 1 a shows sem image of bare montmorillonite used as a support for cuo oxide the porous nature of this clay allows excellent fixation of cuo oxide during the in situ precipitation of cuo into the surface of montmorillonite cu2 can enter as a first step into the interlayer of the montmorillonite when naoh is added cuo can be formed both on the external surface and into the interlayers in the form of pillars the bet surface area of montmorillonite is 49 m2 g 1 fig 1b shows tg analysis of cuo m from 25 to 500 c in which it can be observed two mass loss stages one from 25 to 195 c with the mass change of 5 75 which is due to desorption of physically adsorbed water and a small second mass change of 0 7 corresponding to removal of structural adsorbed water this result shows the importance of montmorillonite clay as a support as it exhibits an excellent swelling behavior 37 which enhances the generation of oxidative ross the more the water molecules are surrounded by the photocatalyst the more ross photogeneration is obtained fig 1c shows the xrd spectrum of cuo m the main characteristic diffraction peak of the montmorillonite crystal was detected at 2θ 20 50 a distinctive peak due to the presence of quartz was detected at 2θ 27 diffraction peaks showing the presence of monoclinic phase of cuo oxide on the surface of montmorillonite were detected at 2θ 32 111 38 111 48 202 58 24 202 and 62 113 as shown in fig 1d the cuo m spectrum shows a broadly visible light responsive allowing direct solar light to treat water in real conditions fig 1e f shows ftir spectra of bare m and cuo m respectively the strong band at around 1000 cm 1 is due to si o stretching in plane a characteristic band of stretching vibration modes of oh groups with al3 is detected at 3600 cm 1 the bands at around 3400 and 1600 cm 1 are due to the adsorbed water molecules in cuo m the band at 3400 cm 1 became larger probably due to oh groups coordinated to octahedral cu2 51 in addition the peak at 3600 cm 1 was decreased in cuo m which might be due to the partial substitution of al oh by cu oh 44 the combined sorbing photocatalytic ability of cuo m was evaluated to treat very complicated real coking wastewater which contains 34 toxic persistent organic compounds pahs and spahs for the purpose of comparison the purification of coking wastewater was carried out by different systems including direct photolysis under solar light dark adsorption by cuo m cuo m light and cuo m light h2o2 since the first cuo m light h2o2 could not treat the wastewater ideally a second run was performed on the obtained sample using the cuo m light h2o2 system the removal results by different methods are listed in table 1 the main important task is to maximize the removal of pahs and spahs yields from coking wastewater the estimated total removal efficiency by the first and second treatments is shown in fig 2 a it can be noticed that around 66 of total removal was obtained with the first treatment the second treatment further enhanced the removal up to 91 during the first treatment 8 compounds out of 34 were removed completely while after the second treatment only 6 compounds were detected in wastewater we notice that the first treatment removed a high yield of compounds compared to the second treatment and this is quite logical since the removal of nano pollution is quite challenging because of the lower mass transfer firstly we should note that the combination of h2o2 and cuo m under light has significantly promoted the removal of pollutants in all cases compared to other systems although the concentration of compounds in coking wastewater is not the same the photolysis sorption and photooxidation behaviors are entirely different depending on the pollutant type such diversity in terms of mechanical removal by different systems depends on many factors including the chemical structure and stability of each pha spah the structure and charge of pollutant species can influence their fixation on cuo m which affects their oxidation by ross photogenerated on the surface of the photocatalyst however it is essential to point out that high competition appears among species in such a complex water matrix system to occupy the adsorptive sites and consume photogenerated ross to simplify the results the removal process was classified into three categories i pollutants removed by the first treatment ii contaminants removed after the second treatment and iii pollutants remain in wastewater even after the second treatment selected pollutants are shown in fig 2b c d respectively in general it can be seen that the concentration of a single pollutant is not a key factor some compounds with higher concentration were removed effectively such as fluoranthene 21 μg l while others at trace concentration i e acenaphythylene were hard to remove and remain in the solution overall the removal process using cuo m light h2o2 showed great ability to treat such complex wastewater it is essential to point out that the purification at large scale central wwtp of this wastewater is carried out by several successive purification steps including adsorption coagulation and oxidation processes chemical and fenton the reason behind such an excellent performance in terms of cuo m light h2o2 system is due to the combined and synergistic effects which cuo m light h2o2 can provide as shown in fig 3 the so called adsorb suttle process taking place on the cuo m surface speeds up the photocatalytic activity after that the photogenerated ross from cuo can oxidize the nearby adsorbed pahs and spahs on the other hand the photogenerated electrons on the cuo surface react with h2o2 to generate hydroxyl radicals the generated oh through photo fenton reaction can oxidize pahs and spahs on the montmorillonite surface and or in bulk solution the sorption ability of montmorillonite can also limit the generation of toxic products as most of them can remain on the surface it was reported in previous studies that photocatalytic oxidation using naked photocatalysts leads to generate highly toxic by products 52 54 4 conclusions in the present study we evaluate the efficiency of cuo m light h2o2 to purify highly contaminated real coking wastewater by following all existing organic pollutants in terms of pahs and spahs the analysis of coking wastewater showed 34 toxic organic compounds of mixed pahs and spahs with different concentrations to properly understand the behavior of different pahs and spahs during the treatment coking wastewater was subjected to other treatment systems including photolysis adsorption homogenous fenton photocatalysis over cuo m and combined photo fenton photocatalysis it was noticed that each pah or spah has different behavior in different systems and it does not relate to the concentration of the pollutant species using cuo m light h2o2 a total reduction in the yield of pollutants was recorded to be 66 within 4 h while a second run on the same treated sample led to a removal rate of 91 from the economic point of view the results obtained in this study are encouraging because of the effective removal at low treatment cost several recent reports have successfully combined some technologies to purify coking wastewater properly however the same platform in terms of cuo m light h2o2 may combine different mechanistic removal pathways working cooperatively on the surface of the photocatalyst and the solution we also emphasize identifying the organic composition before and after the treatment of coking wastewater by gc ms instead of simple characterization of such wastewaters by toc cod and doc due to the detection limits of these latter techniques from technological treating real cases of wastewater by photocatalytic systems is very recommended to help transfer this green technology to real world application list of abbreviations m montmorillonite

noticed that each pah or spah has different behavior in different systems and it does not relate to the concentration of the pollutant species using cuo m light h2o2 a total reduction in the yield of pollutants was recorded to be 66 within 4 h while a second run on the same treated sample led to a removal rate of 91 from the economic point of view the results obtained in this study are encouraging because of the effective removal at low treatment cost several recent reports have successfully combined some technologies to purify coking wastewater properly however the same platform in terms of cuo m light h2o2 may combine different mechanistic removal pathways working cooperatively on the surface of the photocatalyst and the solution we also emphasize identifying the organic composition before and after the treatment of coking wastewater by gc ms instead of simple characterization of such wastewaters by toc cod and doc due to the detection limits of these latter techniques from

13271,the photocatalytic degradation of local dyeing wastewater by al b co doped wo3 nanoparticles under natural sunlight was investigated al b doped wo3 nanoparticles were prepared by wet impregnation method and characterized by different analytical tools daphnia magna was utilized to evaluate the acute toxicity of the untreated and treated wastewater hrsem hrtem analysis confirmed the formation of agglomerated spherical shape for wo3 nanoparticles and mixture of spherical and rod like morphology for al b doped wo3 nanocomposites xrd analysis demonstrated the formation of monoclinic phase and the addition of al and b did not change the phase of wo3 nanoparticles the bet surface area of al b wo3 nanocomposites 66 94 m2 g is higher than undoped wo3 22 49 m2 g the xps analysis suggested substitutional replacement of oxygen either by the dopants and existence of w in 6 oxidation state bandgap energy reduced from 2 42 ev to 1 70 ev due to the immobilization of al and b the al b immobilized wo3 nanoparticles exhibited enhanced photocatalytic performance with 94 0 and 90 0 reduction of cod and toc level the concentration of zn fe ni cu cr and pb in dyeing wastewater reduced after treatment the kinetic data showed that the photodegradation of the dyeing wastewater by al b doped wo3 nanocomposites was faster than wo3 alone and the experimental kinetic data were best suitable for pseudo first order model the treated wastewater had little or almost no toxicity after 24 h and the photocatalyst can be reused for 5 cycles due to its excellent photocatalytic capacity al b co doped wo3 nanoparticles exhibited a significant enhancement in the degradation of local dyeing wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nanoparticles wet impregnation surface area photocatalytic activity local dyeing wastewater 1 introduction in developing countries small scale industry like local dyeing operation dye and tie has been identified as one of the major consumers of fresh water dyes and chemicals during their operations 1 the activities of this cottage industries resulted to indiscriminately release of large quantities of untreated wastewater containing organic dyes pigments biocides surfactants and several other organic and inorganic compounds into the environment causing diverse adverse effects on plants and animals 2 3 local dyeing wastewaters contain acids surfactants dispersants which are responsible for high biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod total organic carbon toc ph total dissolved solids tds colour turbidity oil and grease anions and heavy metals such as chromium copper and cadmium amongst others 4 organic dyes remain integral component of local dyeing wastewater and are main contaminators of water resources 2 5 thus based on the complexity and variability of the local dyeing wastewater there is need for the reduction of priority substances to recommend limits prior to discharge to the environment several conventional methods such as coagulation flocculation sedimentation 6 precipitation and co precipitation 7 ozonation ion exchange and membrane filtration 8 activated carbon adsorption electro coagulation 9 amongst others have been used for the treatment of wastewater some of these methods are relatively slow highly expensive generate toxic sludge which occupies space and low efficiencies and cannot completely remove the contaminants 10 these often in most cases resulted to additional disposal and extra cost in addition physicochemical parameters analysis of wastewater vis a viz colour reduction is no longer acceptable nowadays to establish the impact of pollution pollutants on aquatic species 11 different tests such as bioluminescence tests with vibrio fischeri and growth inhibition tests with pseudomonas putida the acute daphnia magna and algae growth inhibition tests have been used to evaluate the toxicity of wastewater 12 studies have established the toxic effects of raw and treated dyeing wastewater to d magna and found to be less toxic 13 in this study acute toxicity test of d magna is employed for monitoring of wastewater due to its sensitivity to different kind of pollutants furthermore researchers have applied heterogeneous semiconductor metal oxides such as wo3 nanomaterial for destruction of microbes and harmful pollutants in wastewater due to its low cost availability environmental friendliness biological and chemical stability 14 15 the photocatalytic activity is based on the absorption of photon either solar uv or visible light by wo3 which cause electrons transferred from valence band vb to conduction band cb and generate electron hole pairs and through the migrations oxidation or reduction reactions these usually occurred on the surface of the metal oxides and eventually lead to production of hydroxyl and superoxide radicals 16 these free reactive radicals then attack the organic pollutants in wastewater and break it into compounds such as co2 and h2o wo3 is an n type semiconductor with moderate band gap 2 7 2 8 ev has exceptional physical and chemical properties such as high electric resistivity low surface area and high oxidation power which enable its potential applications 17 18 wo3 exists in different polymorphs namely hexagonal orthorhombic and monoclinic and nanostructural network nanoparticles nanoplatelets nanorods and nanowires 19 20 with monoclinic phase found to be more photocatalytically active under uv light than hexagonal or orthorhombic phase 21 however utilization of uv light is not economically feasible and a viable option for the treatment of large amounts of industrial wastewater in view of this development of natural sunlight active catalyst has been identified as a green technology for water and wastewater treatment across the globe because sunlight is readily available cheap abundant environmental friendly and renewable more so the optical response and catalytic activity of wo3 can be tailored to the visible region via doping with metals non metals metal oxides and metalloids encapsulation functionalization and coupling with another semiconductor or compositing with other materials 17 22 doping is one of the strategies often employ to induce visible light activity by altering the band gap of the wo3 nanoparticles and prevent electron hole recombination rates and by extension improve the photocatalytic performance in the visible region 23 the additions of the metals such as pt au and ag to wo3 material have been reported to enhance photocatalytic activity in the visible than ordinary wo3 however metal doping cause reduction of photocatalytic activity and thermal instability 23 on the contrary doping with non metals such as s p n or c can enhance the surface area and the performance of the wo3 based photocatalyst 20 24 more so introduction of non metal onto lattice structure of wo3 usually caused bonding of p states and 2p states of non metal and oxygen in w this orbital interaction resulted to upwards shifting in the valence band edge and reduction in the band gap recently immobilization of metal and non metal have been predicted as a feasible alternative to modify wo3 nanostructure for better performance under visible light 25 in this study aluminium and boron were selected as co dopants for the synthesis of wo3 due to their low toxicity availability of the material tendency to replace oxygen and ability to suppress electron hole recombination rate and by extension lowering the band gap energy of wo3 22 26 boron has the potential of forming local network structures and surface active sites for photocatalytic reactions 27 thus it is expected that combination of al and b material will improve the quantum efficiency and photocatalytic activity of wo3 wo3 nanoparticles have been synthesized by various physical and chemical methods such as solvothermal reduction 19 hydrothermal 28 sol gel 29 non sputtering and electrochemical technique 29 catalytic chemical vapour deposition photo reduction and deposition and others 15 30 however these methods are costly generate toxic byproducts and require complex synthetic procedures as well as high pressure and energy 31 conversely green synthesis involving the uses of plant extracts for the preparation of nanoparticles has several advantages such as presence of metabolites when compared to other methods these phytochemical constituents are responsible for the stabilization capping and reduction of metals from their respective oxidation state to zero valence state 32 carrica papaya belongs to family caricaceae known as papaya paw paw kates and papaw is rich in vitamins phenols proteolytic acts as good antioxidant reducing and antimicrobial agent banala et al 61 reported the reduction of silver in oxidation state of 1 to silver in zero valent by c papaya aqueous extract several studies have been reported the photocatalytic activity of wo3 for the degradation of organic pollutants in aqueous solution under simulated and natural sunlight rhodamine blue 17 monuron 33 lidocaine 9 amoxicillin 30 rhodamine b rhb indigo carmine ic and congo red cr 34 and ethylene 35 similarly there have been many reports on the photodegration of organic contaminants in aqueous matrix either by metals doped wo3 non metals doped wo3 or metal oxides coupled wo3 under different light sources such as methylene blue pdo wo3 15 methylene blue p wo3 18 methylene blue pt wo3 36 4 nitrophenol b wo3 22 our research group had earlier reported the photocatalytic degradation of local dyeing wastewater by p i wo3 and ag2o b2o3 tio2 nanocomposites 37 38 however toxicity test of untreated and treated wastewater was not carried out the role of al and b on the morphology optical textural and catalytic properties of wo3 nanoparticles was not examined however no comprehensive report on the potentials of al b immobilized wo3 nanoparticles for the degradation of organic pollutants in local dyeing wastewater under natural sunlight has been reported to date herein the present study report for the first time the preparation of al b immobilized wo3 nanoparticles using green wet impregnation method the prepared al b wo3 nanocomposites were characterized using several analytical techniques this was followed by the photodegradation of the local dyeing wastewater by the prepared wo3 nanoparticles and al b wo3 nanocomposites under natural sunlight irradiation by measuring change in indicator parameters toc and cod level as a function of time the acute toxicity level of the chemicals presents in the untreated and treated local dyeing effluent was also investigated using d magna as a test organism the mechanism of degradation of organic compounds in dyeing wastewater by al b wo3 photocatalyst under natural sunlight irradiation is also proposed lastly the recycleability potentials of al b wo3 photocatalyst after five repeated cycles were reported and the stability of the nanocatalyst was before and after was examined using xrd and hrsem 2 materials and methods 2 1 material the analytical grade chemicals reagents namely ammonium tungsten hydrate boric acid aluminium oxide sodium hydroxide trioxonitrate v acid with percentage purity in the range of 99 5 99 9 were obtained from sigma aldrich and used without further purification the leaves of c papaya were randomly collected from different locations in minna metropolis and subsequently transported to the laboratory the collected c papaya leaves were washed with distilled water to remove dust particles and later air dried at room temperature for 2 weeks the dried leaves were cut into pieces pound in a wooden mortal and sieved through 2 μm sieve to obtain a fine powder and thereafter stored in a dry container ready for analysis green synthesis of wo3 nanoparticles have been reported in our previous study 31 the local dyeing wastewater used for the experiment was collected from different pits in kwali area council of abuja into a clean 50 l plastic container in the month of october 2020 the samples were transported on ice to the laboratory and stored in the fridge at 4 c for the entire study period 2 2 chemical analysis of local dyeing wastewater the collected dyeing wastewater was characterized for the following parameters chemical oxygen

mixtures were run in the hach colorimeter and results were recorded in mg l chloride determination was carried out using argentometric method nitric acid digestion method described by 41 was employed before heavy metal contents analysis heavy metal contents zn fe cr cd pb and ni were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy aas perkin elmer 200 atomic absorption spectrophotometer the determination of each parameter was carried out three times and average values including their standard deviation were recorded 40 2 3 synthesis of al b wo3 nanocomposites firstly the preparation of al doped wo3 nanoparticle was carried out by mixing 10 ml of 0 05 mol l 1 aluminium oxide solution drop wise with the prepared wo3 nanoparticles and stirred continuously on magnetic stirrer at 1000 rpm for 2 h subsequently the mixture was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 15 min and washed several times with distilled water and further centrifuged at 1000 rpm the separated sample was oven dried at 80 c for 3 h and later calcined at 550 c in a furnace for 2 h 14 this procedure was repeated using 0 1 mol l 1 and 0 2 mol l 1 of aluminium oxide as dopant secondly the preparation of b doped wo3 nanoparticle was carried out by mixing 10 ml of 0 05 mol l 1 boric acid solution drop wise with the prepared wo3 nanoparticles the synthesis was carried out following the aforementioned route for al doped wo3 15 16 lastly the preparation of al b wo3 nanocomposite was carried out by firstly mixed 10 ml of 0 1 mol l 1 aluminium oxide with equal volume of 0 1 mol l 1 boric acid solution thereafter 2 g of prepared wo3 nanoparticles were added to the mixture and stirred on a magnetic stirrer at 1000 rpm for 15 min and the residue was washed several times with distilled water and further centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 15 min the separated samples were then oven dried at 100 c for 3 h and later calcined in the furnace at 550 c for 2 h 14 2 4 characterization of wo3 and al b wo3 nanocomposites the prepared wo3 based nanomaterials were characterized using the following analytical instruments the mineralogical phases were identified using x ray diffractometer xrd d8 bruker axs advance fitted with lynxeye detector and cukα x ray source the morphology and elemental composition of the prepared samples were obtained using zeiss auriga high resolution scanning electron microscope hrsem fitted with a secondary electron detector and an energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds option high resolution transmission electron microscopy model zeiss auriga operated at acceleration voltage of 20 kv was used to examine the microstructure and particle size uv visible spectroscopy in this case the shimadzu uv 1800 was used to determine the wavelength of absorption the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy surface was used to examine the surface oxidation state of the elements in the samples the specific surface area of the synthesized undoped and doped wo3 nanoparticles were determined using a nova 2400e by applying n2 as an adsorbate on a micrometer asap 2020 chemisorption surface area analyzer 2 5 adsorption photolysis and photocatalytic studies prior to photocatalytic activity experiments a control blank experiment was carried out by exposing local dyeing wastewater alone to sunlight irradiation as well as prepared catalyst alone in the dark without sunlight for the adsorption experiment 0 05 g of each prepared catalyst was added to 100 cm3 of the local dyeing wastewater in a 250 cm3 conical flask the flask was corked and stirred on a magnetic stirrer at 200 rpm for 6 h in the dark to allow for sample homogeneity the solution 20 cm3 was sampled periodically at regular interval of 1 h and immediately analyzed for cod and toc this was done to establish that the percentage degradation or removal of the organic compounds in the wastewater was due to adsorption only in addition another control experiment was carried out by exposing 100 cm3 of the local dyeing wastewater to sunlight irradiation in the absence of the prepared catalyst and stirred with a magnetic stirrer at 200 rpm for 6 h again 20 cm3 of the solution was periodically sampled at regular interval and analyzed for cod and toc in order to establish that the percentage degradation of the local dyeing wastewater was via photolysis alone the photocatalytic activities of the synthesized catalysts were evaluated via the degradation of organic compounds in local dyeing wastewater under natural sunlight irradiation for each experiment 10 mg of the prepared wo3 al doped wo3 b doped wo3 and al b doped wo3 were added separately into 250 cm3 beakers each containing 100 cm3 of local dyeing wastewater the mixtures were stirred at 200 rpm for 1 h in darkness to allow for adsorption desorption process prior to exposure to sunlight irradiation thereafter the mixture was exposed to sunlight 252 92 w m2 at 36 c and agitated on a magnetic stirrer for 6 h a volume of 20 cm3 of the solutions were sampled simultaneously at interval of 1 h and immediately analyzed for cod and toc this was done to establish whether the degradation of the wastewater was due to photocatalysis 2 6 reusability test the regeneration studies for wo3 al wo3 b wo3 and al b wo3 were evaluated using 0 1 mol l 1 naoh solution as a desorption medium by adding 10 mg each of the dyeing water adsorbed nanoparticles to 100 cm3 of 0 1 mol l 1 naoh the mixtures were stirred continuously for 30 min at ambient temperature and copiously washed with deionized water to remove the desorbing species thereafter the regenerated wo3 al wo3 b wo3 and al b wo3 were reutilized for 5 cycles to determine the effectiveness of the nanoparticles 2 7 acute toxicity of raw and treated wastewater d magna collected from council for scientific and industrial research csir stellenbosch south africa were first cultured following korea standard procedures 1 40 cultures were maintained in a growth chamber at 21 1 c and 16 h light 8 h dark photoperiod was employed the media were changed every 2 days and the daphnids were fed daily with 5 ml yeast ceropyll tetramin and 3 ml living chlorella water qualities of the culture media were maintained as follows ph 7 4 7 8 hardness 80 100 mg l 1 as caco3 and alkalinity 57 64 mg l 1 as caco3 the acute toxicity test was performed as follows 10 ml of undiluted raw and treated wastewater were measured independently into 6 separate well plates followed by the introduction of 10 active d magna neonates 12 h after birth aerated tap water was used as the control and the experiment was monitored for 48 h of exposure 12 h illumination d daphnia species were not fed during the period under investigation after the exposure period the number of inhibited d magna in each group was counted and recorded the acute toxicities unit tu expressed as growth inhibition with no response to the movement of water was calculated using eq 1 1 tu 100 lc 50 where the values of lc50 were estimated at 24 and 48 h using probit analysis and later put into eq 1 to obtain tu the probit programme version 1 5 was used to perform the calculations and the results were obtained at 95 confidence limits 12 13 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of nanoparticles 3 1 1 hrsem analysis of undoped and al doped wo3 nanoparticle hrsem analysis of the synthesized al doped wo3 nanoparticles and the micrograph obtained at different concentration of aluminium is shown in fig 1 b d unlike the undoped wo3 nanoparticle with highly dispersed less aggregated spherical shape fig 1 a plate like morphologies were noticed when 0 05 mol l 1 of aluminium precursor was incorporated onto the lattice layer wo3 nanoparticles fig 1 d when the concentration of aluminium precursor was increased to 0 1 mol l 1 uniformly distributed agglomerated spherical with less ring like structure were observed in the case of 0 2 mol l 1 al doped wo3 nanoparticle mixture of agglomerated spherical and spheres ring like shape was observed the changes in morphology of undoped wo3 from spherical to mixture of agglomerated spherical and ring like shape may be due to aluminium doping effect this can be explained in terms of small ionic radius of al 0 535 å as compared to w 2 02 å and o 1 207 å which diffused easily into the pores of wo3 nanoparticles the al dopant exhibited adsorption phenomenon onto charge energy distribution tungsten surface which in turn affect the crystal growth and morphological transformation behavior of wo3 nanoparticles 42 it should be noted that as the concentration of aluminium precursor increase the proportions of spherical shapes outweighed the plate like structures this means that morphological changes was a function of concentration of aluminium oxide in the matrix of wo3 nanoparticle the average particle sizes of 0 05 mol l 1 0 1 mol l 1 and 0 2 mol l 1 al doped wo3 nanoparticle were in ascending order of 28 3 nm 18 6 nm 21 1 nm this indicates that at high concentration of 0 2 mol l 1 of aluminium was able to penetrate into the lattice structure of the wo3 without completely changed the morphology and structure of wo3 nanoparticle which agreed with the findings of prabhu et al 43 3 1 2 hrtem with corresponding saed of al doped wo3 nanoparticles the hrtem with micrographs at high and low magnification with their respective saed images of al doped wo3 nanoparticles are presented in fig 2 for 0 05 mol l 1 al doped wo3 shown in fig 2 a highly agglomerated particles were formed in contrast dense spherical and cubic structures were noticed for wo3 nanoparticles doped with 0 1 and 0 2 mol l 1 aluminium precursor the spherical and cubic morphologies increase with increasing concentration of aluminium precursor the changes of morphologies from spherical to cubic may be ascribed to the excessive incorporation of al3 into the host lattice of wo3 this finding is in agreement with the hrsem result in fig 2 e g and the eds result fig 3 additionally the particle size of 0 05 mol l 1 al doped was found to be 18 32 nm and as the concentration of the al dopant increases from 0 1 mol l 1 to 0 2 mol l 1 the average particle size reduced from 16 7 nm to 9 4 nm in the same vein the hrtem images in the set of fig 2 b e and h showed the lattice d spacing as 0 45 nm 0 41 nm and 0 39 nm respectively which correspond to 002 crystal planes the saed patterns demonstrated the presence of continuous clear ring pattern with little additional spots revealing the polycrystalline structure of the al doped wo3 nanoparticles 3 1 3 xrd analysis of al doped wo3 nanoparticles fig 4 b shows the xrd pattern of wo3 doped with different concentration of aluminium the xrd patterns of undoped wo3 nanoparticles have been previously explained in fig 4 b the xrd pattern of 0 05 mol l 1 al doped wo3 nanoparticles showed sharp and intense diffraction peaks at angle 2θ value of 24 00 28 14 42 00 50 00 and 58 02 which correspond to the following crystal planes of 020 200 202 100 110 210 300 and 211 these peaks matched with index pattern of monoclinic phase of wo3 15 18 with an average crystalline size of 17 3 nm according to scherer equation for 0 1 mol l 1 al doped wo3 nanoparticle the diffraction peaks were noticed at 2θ value of 23 13 24 00 24 56 28 12 14 59 28 14 and 28 59 these peaks correspond to the following crystal planes 020 200 100 110 and 101 and matched with the monoclinic phase of wo3 18 the average particle size was found to be 8 2 nm based on scherrer equation the xrd pattern of 0 2 mol l 1 al doped wo3 nanoparticle revealed the presence of high intense peaks at angle 2θ values of 23 13 24 00 28 59 34 20 42 00 and 56 13 which were assigned to the following crystal planes 020 110 101 202 220 112 and 300 these peaks matched with the pattern of monoclinic phase of wo3 whose average crystalline size was 12 02 nm it can be seen that addition of aluminium did not influence change of wo3 phase however responsible for the reduction of crystallite size of wo3 3 1 4 hrsem analysis of b doped wo3 nanoparticles at different concentration the hrsem images of the synthesized boron doped wo3 nanoparticles are shown in fig 5 a d fig 5 a demonstrates the formation of less agglomerated uniform spherical particles unlike fig 5 a it was noticed that when wo3 nanoparticles was doped with 0 05 mol l 1 boron precursor heterogeneously distributed agglomerated spherical ring or slate like shape morphology was observed fig 5 b similar trend was observed for 0 1 mol l 1 boron doped wo3 fig 5 c the evenly distributed agglomerated slate ring like symmetry with small quantity of spherical shapes was observed at higher concentration of 0 2 mol l 1 boron precursor see fig 5 d the change of undoped wo3 from spherical to ring like morphology due to b addition was based on its small ionic radius 0 23 å compared to w and o which distorted or shrinked the lattice and nanostructure of wo3 47 the average particle size decreases as the concentration of the boron dopant increase due to substitution of w or o atoms with b atoms or probably differences in atomic sizes of the elements the average crystallite sizes arranged in ascending order are 18 7 nm 13 4 nm 11 6 nm for 0 05 mol l 1 0 1 mol l 1 and 0 2 mol l 1 b doped wo3 nanoparticles thus at high concentration of 0 2 mol l 1 more boron penetrated the lattice layer and caused morphological structural changes of wo3 nanoparticles than when 0 05 mol l 1 and 0 1 mol l 1 were used 3 1 5 hrtem eds saed analysis of b doped wo3 nanoparticles high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem micrographs at high 2 nm and low 50 nm magnification and saed images of the synthesized b doped wo3 nanoparticles are shown in fig 6 fig 6 a revealed the presence of evenly distributed agglomerated spherical particles while fig 6 d showed heterogeneous and aggregated spherical and cubic shape in the case of fig 6 g which is 0 2 mol l 1 b doped wo3 nanoparticles heterogeneous mixture of spherical and cubic were observed it can be seen that an increase in the concentration of boron from 0 05 mol l 1 to 0 2 mol l 1 was responsible for the morphological transformation from spherical to mixture of spherical and cubic structure these microstructural changes were ascribed to the diffusion and b substitution of w resulted to distortion and internal stress in the wo3 host lattice as the concentration of boron dopant increase to 0 1 mol l 1 the average crystallite size reduced to 8 4 nm and similar trend of size reduction was observed as the concentration increase to 0 2 mol l 1 to average crystallite size 5 6 nm the reduction of particle size as the concentration of b increases corroborated the findings of 27 and 41 the hrtem images in the insets fig 6 b e and h show the lattice d spacing as 0 35 0 37 and 0 42 nm respectively which correspond to the 002 interplanar distances and further support planes of monoclinic wo3 the presence of lattice fringes at high magnification further confirmed that the synthesized materials were highly crystalline as can be seen in the saed patterns fig 6 c 6 f and 6 i which demonstrate the appearance of continuous ring patterns and bright diffraction spots energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds was done to investigate elemental composition of the as synthesized b doped wo3 nanoparticles at different concentration of boron and the eds result is displayed in fig 7 the eds results revealed atomic percentage of tungsten oxygen carbon and boron the level of w reduces as the concentration of the dopant b increase while no b was detected non detection of b suggests successful diffusion and penetration of the b onto the inner pores of wo3 nanoparticles this is because the ionic radii 0 23 å and atomic weight 10 8 of b is smaller than that of w and o the incorporation of b caused distortion and overlapping of the monoclinic planes of wo3 and subsequent transformation to ring or plate like morphology phase respectively 3 1 6 x ray diffraction analysis of b doped wo3 nanoparticles the xrd patterns of wo3 nanoparticles doped with different concentrations of boron are shown in fig 8 b d the xrd pattern of un doped wo3 nanoparticle a showed sharp diffraction peaks 001 020 200 and 202 crystal plane that correspond to 2θ value of 23 13 24 00 and 28 12 respectively these diffraction peaks matched with the index pattern of monoclinic phase of wo3 with the jcpds card no 83 0947 and average crystalline size of 17 32 nm 18 for 0 05 mol l 1 b doped wo3 the diffraction peaks were noticed at 2θ value of 23 13 24 00 24 56 28 12 28 14 and 28 59 respectively these peaks correspond to the following crystal planes 002 020 200 202 100 110 and 101 and matched with the monoclinic phase of wo3 the average particle size was determined to be 14 3 nm furthermore there was no significant difference when 0 1 mol l 1 boron precursor was introduced onto the lattice layer of wo3 nanoparticles in fact weak diffraction peaks observed at 2θ value of 23 13 24 00 24 56 28 12 28 59 50 00 56 13 and 76 00 these were ascribed to 002 020 200 202 110 101 221 311 and 322 crystal planes and depicts the formation of monoclinic phase of wo3 the average crystallite size was calculated using scherer equation and found to be 9 2 nm in the case of 0 2 mol l 1 b doped wo3 nanoparticle the xrd pattern revealed main characteristics peaks at 2θ value of 14 59 23 13 24 00 28 14 28 59 28 12 42 00 56 13 and 76 00 which were assigned to miller indices of 100 002 020 110 101 202 220 112 221 311 and 322 these peaks matched properly with monoclinic wo3 phase with average crystalline size of 6 4 nm it can be noticed that slight difference exists in the diffraction pattern of the undoped and b doped wo3 nanoparticles precisely the peak intensity for monoclinic phase reduced with increasing amount of boron dopant this clearly support the hrsem result fig 5 b d as evidence in the morphological transformation from completely spherical shape to ring or plate like structures comparatively the intensity of the diffraction peaks slightly reduced compared to either by w or o in wo3 monoclinic because of the smaller ionic radii of b 0 23 å than w 2 02 å and o 1 207 å although substitution of w by b is still a subject of further investigation due to the mismatching of oxidation state between b3 and w6 27 it is evident that not all the b were involved in doping activities as some formed oxides with its self b2o3 and existed as cluster on the surface of wo3 nanoparticle fig 5 b d this implies that concentration of boron dopant influenced the morphology and the crystalline sizes of synthesized wo3 however did not change its phase 3 1 7 hrsem hrtem saed micrograph of undoped and al b doped wo3 nanoparticles the hrsem hrtem saed micrograph of the undoped wo3 and al b co doped wo3 nanocomposites is shown in fig 9 fig 9 a revealed the formation of purely spherical shapes which correspond to monoclinic phase while in the case of al b doped wo3 nanocomposite partial destruction of the spherical shapes was noticed due to simultaneous diffusion and substitutional mechanism of aluminium and boron resulting to internal structural grain boundaries and stress adjustment of lattice crystal of wo3 caused by the entity of the two dopants 46 48 this finding is supported by eds results of the nanocomposites fig 10 this implies that the changes in shape of wo3 nanoparticle suggest inner penetration and surface deposition of al and b based on their equal number of electron the hrtem micrographs at high 2 nm and low 50 nm magnification and saed images are presented in fig 9 c e the hrtem image fig 9 c demonstrated the presence of dense agglomerated tiny particles due to destruction of spherical morphology observed for undoped wo3 nanoparticles and may be attributed to the penetration of al3 and b3 based on their equal number of valence electrons onto the host lattice of wo3 in addition the saed pattern revealed the formation of ring patterns thus suggest that al b co doped wo3 is of high crystallinity 3 1 8 xrd analysis of undoped wo3 and al b doped wo3 nanocomposites fig 11 depicts the xrd pattern of undoped wo3 and al b doped wo3 nanocomposites the xrd pattern of un doped wo3 nanoparticle demonstrated the formation of sharp and intense diffraction peaks at 2θ value of 23 12 24 00 24 56 and 28 12 which correspond to 002 020 200 and 202 crystal plane these peaks matched well with the monoclinic phase of wo3 with average crystalline size of 17 32 nm while the xrd pattern of al b doped wo3 nanocomposites revealed the presence of sharp but weak diffraction peaks at 2θ value of 23 13 24 00 27 02 28 00 34 02 50 00 and 57 00 with the following crystal planes 002 020 200 110 202 210 300 and 221 these peaks matched properly with monoclinic phase of wo3 whose average crystalline size was 21 1 nm the slight increase in particle size may be ascribed to the doping and synergetic effect between the two dopants 18 none detection of al or b in the composite material implies that the concentration of the two dopants was low or below the detection limit of the instrument the addition of the two dopants did not distort the phase of wo3 3 1 9 uv visible diffuse reflectance analysis and bandgap energy calculation the uv visible diffuse reflectance analysis of wo3 al doped wo3 b doped wo3 and al b doped wo3 nanocomposites in the wavelength range of 200 800 nm is presented in fig 12 a while fig 12 b depicts the tauc s plot of the band gap energies of undoped wo3 and co doped wo3 nanocomposites as shown in fig 12 a it can be seen that the absorption edge of the uv visible diffuse reflectance spectra shifted to a higher wavelength red shift b wo3 the slight red shift observed may be due to the simultaneous doping of al and b onto the wo3 nanoparticles in addition the red shift may be linked to the charge transfer transition between the al and b electrons and the conduction or valence band of wo3 the electrons transfer occurred between 2p and 5d orbital for b and w and 3p and 5d orbitals of al and w respectively similar findings were reported by 44 and 45 the shift from 500 510 nm to the visible region may be ascribed to the suppression of the rate of recombination of electron hole pairs in the wo3 nanoparticles by aluminium and boron on the contrary the absorbance edge of the bare wo3 nanoparticles was approximately at wavelength of 500 nm while that of the b wo3 was less than the ordinary wo3 which means that for the mono doped material the absorption threshold shifted to a much lower wavelength 500 nm due to burstein moss effect and less energetic interaction between electron in 2p orbital of b and electrons in 5d orbital of w 14 the al doped wo3 absorbs at a longer wavelength than wo3 alone attributable to the doping effect of al into the interstitial layer of wo3 based on ionic radius mechanism al3 0 05 nm and w6 0 065 nm the shift to higher wavelength noticed for al doped wo3 sample may be linked to strong interaction between energetic 3p electrons in al and 5d electrons in w compared with the undoped wo3 the absorption bands of al doped wo3 and al b doped wo3 nanomaterials were greater than wo3 alone this red shifts and enhancement of absorbance of the two materials may be explained based on the basis of simultaneous charge transition between al3 and b3 electrons and wo3 conduction or valence band the energy band gap eg values were obtained from the absorption coefficient calculated as a function of photon energy hv the relationship between the absorption coefficient and photon energy is expressed in eq 2 2 ahv 2 c hv eg where c is a constant and can be calculated using expression α a d where a is the absorbance and d is the thickness of the sample in the uv visible cell the band gap energy of the synthesized nanocomposites was obtained by extrapolating the linear portion of the graph αhv 2 versus hv as shown in fig 12 b the band gap energy of 2 42 ev for the synthesized wo3 in this study is lower than 2 61 ev reported by li et al 46 who prepared wo3 via hydrothermal method wo3 is an n type semiconductor with band gap energy in the range of 2 6 ev to 3 2 ev 47 the differences in the band gap energy may be ascribed to the different method of synthesis and reaction conditions which determined the morphology and the crystalline nature of the material in addition doping effect of carbonaceous materials from the plant extract used during the synthesis produced new crystal defects and localized states and as such may be responsible for the lower band gap energy reported in this study the band gap energy for b wo3 al wo3 al b wo3 were 2 70 ev 2 20 ev 1 7 ev respectively the reduction in band gap energy of the wo3 may be due to doping effect of boron and aluminium which increased oxygen vacancies this suggests that al b wo3 composites with the smallest band gap value may exhibit excellent photocatalytic properties under sunlight than others 3 1 10 brunauer emmett teller bet analysis of the prepared nanomaterials the specific surface area m2 g and pore size of the synthesized wo3 al wo3 b wo3 and al b wo3 were determined using n2 adsorption desorption bet method and corresponding curves is shown in fig 13 a and b according to iupac the four samples exhibited a type iv isotherm with an h1 type hysteresis loop linked to open ended cylindrical pores an indication of mesoporosity over micro or macroporosity 31 the pore size distribution of four samples revealed the presence of mesopores with pore diameter in the 3 2 88 nm see fig 13 b the measured specific surface area and pore size of the prepared nanomaterials is shown in table 1 from table 1 it can be noticed that the surface area of the nanomaterials increased in the order of al b wo3 al wo3 wo3 while an opposite trend was observed for the pore sizes the bet surface area value of the wo3 increases slightly when aluminium and boron dopant were mono doped however the introduction of aluminium and boron as co dopants significantly enhanced the surface area from 22 49 m2 g to 63 94 m2 g the increment in surface area may be due to the intercalation of the al3 and b3 in the lattice structure of the wo3 44 47 another possible reason may be linked to no change or distortion of the monoclinic phase and the symmetry of the wo3 3 1 11 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis the elemental composition and the oxidation states of the as synthesized wo3 al wo3 b wo3 and al b wo3 were determined using xps and the results are shown in fig 14 the following elements w al o b and c were obviously present on the surface of the nanomaterial as shown in fig 14 a typical high energy resolution spectrum of the w 4f region is shown in fig 15 a the 4f energy level splits upon ionization with a spin orbit splitting ratio for the w 4f5 2 and w 4f7 2 levels of 3 4 the fits indicate two doublet peaks the first set 35 6 and 37 6 ev corresponds to a w6 stoichiometric wo3 state and the second 34 2 ev to w4 while the peak at 36 2 ev is assigned to w5 indicates o vacancy and or doped species replacement 17 the first set of peaks for w at binding energies 35 6 and 37 6 ev depicts w6 o bonds in wo3 the sharp peak at 530 5 ev fig 15 b corresponds to the binding energy of o 1s signify the characteristic peak of lattice oxygen o2 in wo3 48 in fig 6b o 1s peak was located at 530 5 ev while in fig 15 d a slight difference in the binding energy in the range of 0 1 0 3 ev was observed for b wo3 and al b wo3 respectively the shift noticed for o 1 s in b wo3 and al b wo3 is similar to that of w4f peak the shifting phenomena may be due to relaxation of w atoms due to the removal of an o atom thereby solidifying the bond of other lattices the apparent slackening reduced the bond length of wo including overlapping of other bonds dangling within the framework of w a shift in binding energies observed in al b wo3 for w 4f and o 1s suggested the existence of strong interaction between w6 and oxygen vacancies studies have shown that oxygen removal based on outward motion from the next nearest neighbour o in wo3 often causes compression of bonds by 20 thus a slight shift noticed for o 1s and w4f have been ascribed to the presence of oxygen vacancies similar phenomenon was observed for wo3 x 17 in the same vein photoelectron doublet peaks of al 2s and al 2p were found at the binding energies of 80 ev and 75 ev respectively fig 15 e confirmed successful incorporation of al onto the surface layer of wo3 this implies that one of the o 1s has been substituted or replaced by al the binding energy peak of b 1s in the fig 15 f located at 190 5 ev revealed that the boron dopant is in trivalent state b3 confirming the successful immobilization of the boron into the lattice structure of the wo3 in summary it was observed that the wo3 sample contain two contributing factors firstly one from w 4f energy enveloped with a stoichiometric wo3 and non stoichiometric contribution wo3 x 31 the non stoichiometric wo3 x is an indication of o vacancies and possible the replacement of the lattice oxygen in wo3 by the two dopants al and b it is well known that the presence of c oh groups on the surface can trap the positive holes and prevent electron hole recombination increasing the mobility and lifetime of the photo generated holes 49 closer inspection of the detail xps carbon 1 s fits see fig 15 g j shows clearly that the al b wo3 specimen has a high c oh peak indicated with arrow compared to the other specimens this is followed by the al wo3 specimen and the rest has almost no c oh present apart from the surface area and bandgap it looks as if the prevention of electron hole recombination plays the dominant role in the higher photocatalytic activity of al b wo3 3 2 photocatalytic studies the photocatalytic activity of al b doped wo3 nanoparticles on the degradation of local dyeing wastewater was evaluated under sunlight irradiation prior to this the selected physiochemical parameters of the local dyeing wastewater were determined and the result is shown in table 2 comparing the raw values with the permissible limits set by world health organisation who 50 it is clear that the collected dyeing wastewater is not safe for both human and aquatic species and therefore must be treated before direct discharge into the environment the unpleasant odour and colour in the raw dyeing wastewater were ascribed to the presence different organic and inorganic materials such as detergents fabric whiteners and others used in the dyeing operations the ph value of the raw wastewater was 9 5 which mean the wastewater is alkaline and slightly higher than the recommended value by who 50 and higher value of ph may be linked to excessive use of carbonates bicarbonates sodium hydroxide and bleaching compounds during bleaching process which increase the toxicity not only that the tds value is also high above the permissible limit which suggests high amount of suspended solids in the water used during the dyeing operation 51 52 high amount of suspended solids is problematic for treatment and thus the collected wastewater was subjected to filtration before photocatalytic process according to reddy and osborne 53 electrical conductivity ec is the potential of chemical substances to possess electrons and this depends on amount of ionic salts and dissolved solids in this case it was found that the ec of untreated and treated wastewater selected was less than the permissible limits 1000 2000 μm2 cm high amount of ec in water did not support the survival of aquatic species based on the initial bod toc and cod value it can be inferred that the wastewater contains several toxic organic and inorganic compounds which must be decomposed into co2 and h2o table 2 also shows that the dyeing wastewater contain several anions and cations with sulphate as the predominant these anions and cations are classified as radical scavengers which compete with hydroxyl radicals during photocatalytic oxidation of dyeing wastewater table 2 also reveals the presence of five toxic heavy metals and the order of occurrence of the metals were zn cr fe ni pb this means zinc was the most abundant metal and may be ascribed to high mineral content in water used during dyeing operation similar observation was reported by 50 52 exposure to each of the metals has been linked to different health challenges for instance chromium toxicity can cause liver and kidney disorders while cumulative effect of pb in the body can result to hypertension neurological disorders amongst others table 2 shows significant reduction of the indicator parameters in the presence of wo3 mono doped wo3 and co doped wo3 under sunlight irradiation the co doped wo3 behaved better than undoped wo3 and mono doped wo3 in removal of indicator parameters in dyeing wastewater and the obtained results were lower than the permissible limit of who standard 50 see table 2 it was noticed that the level of conductivity of the treated water is significantly higher than untreated wastewater which suggest the presence of anions and cations in the former than the latter this is an evidence of partial degradation of the organic compounds in the wastewater into harmless species due to their competition with free reactive species for the binding sites during catalytic reaction under sunlight it was generally observed that the concentrations of heavy metals reduced significantly after the photocatalytic treatment of local dyeing wastewater with the prepared nanomaterials the decrease in the amount of heavy metals in the treated water suggests that the prepared nanomaterials also performed as nanoadsorbent it was also noticed that the decrease in the indicator parameters was nanocatalysts dependent the biodegradability of effluent in terms of bod cod is greater than 0 6 when compared to bod cod of less than 0 4 reported by ramos et al 54 this suggests that the treatment of the dyeing wastewater can be conveniently done using promising physicochemical method such as photocatalysis for the removal of cod and toc 54 the reductions of the indicator parameters especially cod and toc in the local dyeing wastewater under the influence of the nanocatalysts as a function of irradiation time under natural sunlight using eq 3 is shown in fig 16 b and c respectively 3 percentage removal c o c t c o 100 where co and ct are initial and residual concentrations of cod and toc at different intervals of irradiation respectively the raw indigenous textile wastewater collected from different pits at the sampling site at different dilution ratios 1 5 10 50 and 70 were subjected to uv visible spectroscopic analysis fig 16 a the uv visible spectra of a dark and light blue colouration revealed appearance of broad peak of maximum absorbance in the range of 619 640 nm this suggests that the dyes used by the locals belong to 7 aryl substituted rhodamines groups 53 no noticeable peak was observed for 1 5 and 10 dye solution due to the dilution effect it was noticed from fig 16 b and c that the concentration of these indicator parameters cod and toc did not change significantly either under natural sunlight irradiation or in the presence of catalyst alone which mean that the degradation of these dye molecules did not follow photolysis and adsorption pathways it can be noticed from the two figs that the degradation efficiency of the organic compounds based on the indicator parameters increases with increasing irradiation time this implies that there is an existence of a direct linear relationship between the nanocatalysts and irradiation time for instance the reduction of cod value of the dye molecules at 240 min was in the order b wo3 78 9 wo3 85 0 al wo3 89 4 al b wo3 94 0 under the same applied conditions the toc reduction level occurred as follows 68 9 73 4 80 9 90 0 for the following photocatalysts b wo3 wo3 al wo3 al b wo3 it is obvious that the degradation rate of al b wo3 for both parameters was faster than other catalysts under the same applied conditions the differences in the photocatalytic behavior of the synthesized materials can be explained in terms of suppression of the electron hole recombination rate of wo3 by the two dopants 9 the higher photocatalytic activity of the al b wo3 nanocomposites with respect to the mono doped and undoped wo3 can also be interpreted in terms of the two added dopants having different energy levels for their corresponding conduction and valence band 15 16 this resulted to the higher interfacial charge transfer efficiency from the dopants to the semiconductor metal oxide leading to faster electron hole separation and higher photocatalytic activity the differences in the overall activity of the nanocatalysts can also be attributed to the loose structural morphology a high surface area evidence of more active and binding sites moderate band gap energy and surface hydroxyl groups for instance al b wo3 with the smallest band gap energy 1 7 ev and higher surface area 533 94 m2 g exhibited better photocatalytic performance than other catalysts due to the existence of synergetic effect between the two dopants in the composite 17 18 in the same vein our results also indicate that al wo3 performed better than b wo3 and undoped wo3 under the same conditions the observed trend can be linked to smaller band gap energy of 2 20 ev al wo3 than 2 42 ev wo3 and 2 70 ev b wo3 14 this implies that nanocatalyst with the lowest band gap prevented the electron hole recombination rate than other and hence responsible for the observed higher photocatalytic activity a close observation of the degradation performance showed higher activity for undoped wo3 than b wo3 this suggests that the content of boron may be responsible for the observed decreased surface area and the photoactivity whereas the doping effect of carbonaceous material from the plant extract onto the frame structure of wo3 enhanced its high oxidation potential under natural sunlight than b wo3 material 14 additionally carbon is neither strong electronegative nor electropositive and thus suppress and retard the promoted and transferred electrons from the valence band to conduction bands of wo3 surface based on lower fermi level mechanism 14 this phenomenon usually created a schottky barrier at the interface between wo3 and carbon which enable free movement of the photo generated electrons from wo3 surface towards the carbon surface not only that the recombination rate of photo generated electrons and holes may be prevented by carbon and as a result favoured enhancement of photocatalytic activity this finding agreed with the previous studies reported by hang et al 45 where 5 fe wo3 exhibited greater photocatalytic efficiency of 93 at an irradiation time of 300 min under visible light irradiation than the undoped alone the performance of the nanocatalysts prepared previously was compared with this present study in table 3 according to table 3 it can be noticed that the photocatalytic behavior of the nanocatalyst depend on the nature of the pollutants surface area and the band gap energy it was found that the catalyst prepared in this study performed better than other catalysts except wo3 reported by wang et al 26 the differences could be ascribed to the nature of the pollutants while this study used real environmental sample containing several organic compounds wang et al 26 used simulated solution which did not contain any radical scavengers or suspended solids again competition for active sites by the organic compounds is limited in the simulated solution compared to real environmental sample used generally it was found that the physicochemical parameters of the raw wastewater reduced considerably after treatment with the various synthesized nanocatalyst the behavior of the nanocatalysts may be linked to the surface area and surface adsorbed functional groups 3 2 1 kinetics studies of the photodegradation of local dyeing wastewater by wo3 photocatalysts the experimental data obtained from the photodegradation of organic compounds in the local dyeing wastewater was fitted into three different kinetic models namely pseudo first order pseudo second order and modified freundlich as presented eqs 4 to 6 the results expressed in terms of correlation coefficient r2 rate constant k error functions sse and x 2 are shown in tables 4 and 5 respectively 4 ln c o c t kt 5 1 c t kt 1 c o 6 c t k c o t 1 m where co and ct are initial and final concentration of the organic compounds in dyeing wastewater t is the reaction time min k is the rate constant and m is a constant according to tables 4 and 5 it is evident that the experimental data best fitted to pseudo first order compared to other models based on the value of correlation coefficient r2 and rate constant k for all the synthesized materials besides correlation coefficient r2 error functions such as sse and x 2 were also used to adjudge the best fitted model to kinetic data and values closer to zero depicts a significant agreement between the experimental and theoretical values the fitness followed the order of al b wo3 al wo3 wo3 b wo3 for both toc and cod in the local dyeing wastewater again the performance of the nanocatalysts may be due to the high surface area and the low band gap of al b doped wo3 than other catalysts this suggests that the decomposition process of the organic compounds in the local dyeing wastewater by the synthesized photocatalyst is monolayer in nature and depends only on one factor the reduction of toc or cod in the local dyeing wastewater depends only on the concentration of the organic compounds additionally the degradation mechanism of the organic compounds is adsorption desorption controlled not only that the photocatalytic mineralization of the dye molecules occurred mostly on the surface of wo3 nanoparticles the differences in the rate constant may be linked to the nature of catalyst method of preparation of the catalyst surface area and band gap energy 3 3 mechanism of al b doped wo3 photocatalysts the improved catalytic efficiency of al b wo3 for the degradation of local dyeing wastewater has been linked to the production of the four reactive species namely o2 superoxy anion oh hydroxyl radical e and h 14 38 during the photocatalytic reactions the organic compounds in the wastewater were adsorbed on the surface of al b wo3 followed by excitation of the dye molecules the electron in the valence band moved to the conduction band of pure wo3 thus creating an electronic vacancy or hole in the valence band in case of al doped wo3 the w6 lattice position was replaced by al3 ions and then lowered the conduction band of wo3 on the contrary addition of b increased the band gap energy of wo3 due to burstein moss effect see fig 17 14 the roles played by the dopants on the enhancement of toc and cod reduction differ and are explained as follows al3 in the composite promoted charge carrier separation efficiency causing migration of al3 to the catalyst surface for o2 photoadsorption boron also accelerated the activity of wo3 under natural sunlight through formation of some favorable local structures and surface active sites during photocatalytic reactions under the influence of natural sunlight irradiation photogenerated electrons from al reach wo3 via b or from b to wo3 via al the photogenerated electrons in al b oxidizes very rapidly to form superoxy anion o2 radicals whereas the holes react with water molecules to produce hydroxyl oh radicals 55 oh is primarily generated via oxidative paths after which due to its strong oxidizing ability these two radicals react with the dye molecules and eventually produced some intermediates co2 and h2o the bandgap energy of pure wo3 was lowered by the addition of al3 and b3 onto the lattice layer of w see fig 17 the two dopants capture electrons during photocatalytic process and as a result recombination of electron hole pair was suppressed and hence enhanced the photocatalytic activity for al b doped wo3 moreover the smaller bandgap energy due to al b dopant can play another role in enhancing the visible light photocatalytic activity of wo3 catalyst the proposed reaction mechanisms for the degradation of organic compounds by al b doped wo3 under natural sunlight irradiation are presented in fig 17 and eqs 7 to 17 7 al b wo 3 hv e cb h vb 8 h 2 o oh h 9 hvb h 2 o oh h 10 hvb oh oh 11 e cb o 2 o 2 12 o 2 2 h e cb h 2 o 2 13 o 2 h h o 2 14 h o 2 h o 2 h 2 o 2 1 2 o 2 15 h 2 o 2 h e cb oh h 2 o 16 oh organic dyes intermediates h 2 o co 2 17 o 2 organic dyes intermediates h 2 o co 2 3 4 toxicity test of local dyeing wastewater to daphnia magna table 2 shows that acute toxicity conducted on untreated local dyeing wastewater using d magna indicator was 5 4 thus suggest that the wastewater is highly toxic and therefore not fit to be released into the environment the toxicity of local dyeing wastewater to d magna could be linked to high level of zn fe cod toc and tds see table 2 these findings support previous work 1 on the contrary it was observed that d magna toxicity decreased after photocatalytic treatment with the following nanomaterials wo3 1 1 b wo3 0 8 al wo3 0 4 and al b wo3 0 2 respectively based on hazard classification system for wastewaters discharged into the aquatic environment it can be concluded that wastewater treated with wo3 alone with tu value of 1 1 has acute toxicity while that treated with b wo3 with tu 0 8 exhibits slight acute toxicity it was found that toxicity unit tu value of local dyeing wastewater treated using al wo3 and al b wo3 show no evidence of acute toxicity because tu value was less than 0 4 56 similar trend was reported by kim et al 57 who reported toxicity reduction using electrocoagulation electroflotation processes the differences in the behavior of the nanocatalysts may be linked to their surface area and band gap energy the daphnia toxicity test showed that treated wastewater had little or almost no toxicity depending on the nanocatalysts after 48 h whereas the raw wastewaters did 3 5 stability and reusability of nanocatalysts cost reduction has been reported as major attribute for the prevention and treatment of pollution due to solid waste at the industrial level 60 sequel to that the photocatalytic regeneration capacity of undoped wo3 b wo3 al wo3 and al b doped wo3 for dyeing wastewater treatment was investigated and the result shown in fig 18 accordingly the photocatalytic activity for dyeing wastewater by undoped wo3 b wo3 al wo3 and al b doped wo3 were nearly 100 in the 1st 2nd and third cycles beyond the third regeneration cycle regeneration ability was observed to be above 85 even after 5th regeneration cycle as observed the photocatalytic activity of the nanoparticles was undoped wo3 85 b wo3 88 al wo3 90 and al b wo3 93 even after the 5th cycle considering cost reduction and the environmental protection undoped wo3 b doped wo3 al doped wo3 and al b doped wo3 showed reliable reusable attribute for photocatalytic degradation of dyeing wastewater from figs 19 and 20 it could be seen that the mineralogical phase and morphology of the nanocatalysts after the 5th cycle was not completely destroyed the slight changes may be occupation of the binding sites by the light and heavy pollutants thus making their core shell structures slightly distorted 4 conclusion in summary separate and simultaneous immobilization of wo3 with al and b were reported the synthesized nanomaterials were examined using several characterization tools the photocatalytic activity of the various prepared nanocatalysts over local dyeing wastewater under natural sunlight irradiation was investigated the acute toxicity of untreated and treated wastewater was tested using d magna based on these the following conclusions were drawn addition of b and al onto wo3 did not distort its monoclinic phase but was responsible for the reduction of band gap energy from 2 42 ev wo3 to 1 70 ev al b doped wo3 al b doped wo3 composite exhibited enhanced photodegradation efficiency better than its ordinary wo3 b wo3 and al wo3 with total organic carbon toc and chemical oxygen demand cod reduction efficiency of 96 5 and 97 3 due to differences in band gap and specific surface area bare wo3 performed better under natural sunlight irradiation than b doped wo3 due to the presence of carbon doping effect in the former than the latter the kinetic data demonstrated that the photodegradation of the dye molecules in local dyeing wastewater by al b doped wo3 nanocomposites was faster than the monodoped wo3 and bare wo3 nanoparticles and the experimental kinetic data obeyed the pseudo first order followed by modified freundlich and pseudo second order model this study demonstrated that al b wo3 nanocomposites could be reusable even after five cycles while daphnia toxicity test showed that treated wastewater had little or almost no toxicity depending on the nanocatalysts after 48 h whereas the raw wastewaters did the toxic nature of the raw wastewater may be due to its complex mixture

13271,the photocatalytic degradation of local dyeing wastewater by al b co doped wo3 nanoparticles under natural sunlight was investigated al b doped wo3 nanoparticles were prepared by wet impregnation method and characterized by different analytical tools daphnia magna was utilized to evaluate the acute toxicity of the untreated and treated wastewater hrsem hrtem analysis confirmed the formation of agglomerated spherical shape for wo3 nanoparticles and mixture of spherical and rod like morphology for al b doped wo3 nanocomposites xrd analysis demonstrated the formation of monoclinic phase and the addition of al and b did not change the phase of wo3 nanoparticles the bet surface area of al b wo3 nanocomposites 66 94 m2 g is higher than undoped wo3 22 49 m2 g the xps analysis suggested substitutional replacement of oxygen either by the dopants and existence of w in 6 oxidation state bandgap energy reduced from 2 42 ev to 1 70 ev due to the immobilization of al and b the al b immobilized wo3 nanoparticles exhibited enhanced photocatalytic performance with 94 0 and 90 0 reduction of cod and toc level the concentration of zn fe ni cu cr and pb in dyeing wastewater reduced after treatment the kinetic data showed that the photodegradation of the dyeing wastewater by al b doped wo3 nanocomposites was faster than wo3 alone and the experimental kinetic data were best suitable for pseudo first order model the treated wastewater had little or almost no toxicity after 24 h and the photocatalyst can be reused for 5 cycles due to its excellent photocatalytic capacity al b co doped wo3 nanoparticles exhibited a significant enhancement in the degradation of local dyeing wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nanoparticles wet impregnation surface area photocatalytic activity local dyeing wastewater 1 introduction in developing countries small scale industry like local dyeing operation dye and tie has been identified as one of the major consumers of fresh water dyes and chemicals during their operations 1 the activities of this cottage industries resulted to indiscriminately release of large quantities of untreated wastewater containing organic dyes pigments biocides surfactants and several other organic and inorganic compounds into the environment causing diverse adverse effects on plants and animals 2 3 local dyeing wastewaters contain acids surfactants dispersants which are responsible for high biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod total organic carbon toc ph total dissolved solids tds colour turbidity oil and grease anions and heavy metals such as chromium copper and cadmium amongst others 4 organic dyes remain integral component of local dyeing wastewater and are main contaminators of water resources 2 5 thus based on the complexity and variability of the local dyeing wastewater there is need for the reduction of priority substances to recommend limits prior to discharge to the environment several conventional methods such as coagulation flocculation sedimentation 6 precipitation and co precipitation 7 ozonation ion exchange and membrane filtration 8 activated carbon adsorption electro coagulation 9 amongst others have been used for the treatment of wastewater some of these methods are relatively slow highly expensive generate toxic sludge which occupies space and low efficiencies and cannot completely remove the contaminants 10 these often in most cases resulted to additional disposal and extra cost in addition physicochemical parameters analysis of wastewater vis a viz colour reduction is no longer acceptable nowadays to establish the impact of pollution pollutants on aquatic species 11 different tests such as bioluminescence tests with vibrio fischeri and growth inhibition tests with pseudomonas putida the acute daphnia magna and algae growth inhibition tests have been used to evaluate the toxicity of wastewater 12 studies have established the toxic effects of raw and treated dyeing wastewater to d magna and found to be less toxic 13 in this study acute toxicity test of d magna is employed for monitoring of wastewater due to its sensitivity to different kind of pollutants furthermore researchers have applied heterogeneous semiconductor metal oxides such as wo3 nanomaterial for destruction of microbes and harmful pollutants in wastewater due to its low cost availability environmental friendliness biological and chemical stability 14 15 the photocatalytic activity is based on the absorption of photon either solar uv or visible light by wo3 which cause electrons transferred from valence band vb to conduction band cb and generate electron hole pairs and through the migrations oxidation or reduction reactions these usually occurred on the surface of the metal oxides and eventually lead to production of hydroxyl and superoxide radicals 16 these free reactive radicals then attack the organic pollutants in wastewater and break it into compounds such as co2 and h2o wo3 is an n type semiconductor with moderate band gap 2 7 2 8 ev has exceptional physical and chemical properties such as high electric resistivity low surface area and high oxidation power which enable its potential applications 17 18 wo3 exists in different polymorphs namely hexagonal orthorhombic and monoclinic and nanostructural network nanoparticles nanoplatelets nanorods and nanowires 19 20 with monoclinic phase found to be more photocatalytically active under uv light than hexagonal or orthorhombic phase 21 however utilization of uv light is not economically feasible and a viable option for the treatment of large amounts of industrial wastewater in view of this development of natural sunlight active catalyst has been identified as a green technology for water and wastewater treatment across the globe because sunlight is readily available cheap abundant environmental friendly and renewable more so the optical response and catalytic activity of wo3 can be tailored to the visible region via doping with metals non metals metal oxides and metalloids encapsulation functionalization and coupling with another semiconductor or compositing with other materials 17 22 doping is one of the strategies often employ to induce visible light activity by altering the band gap of the wo3 nanoparticles and prevent electron hole recombination rates and by extension improve the photocatalytic performance in the visible region 23 the additions of the metals such as pt au and ag to wo3 material have been reported to enhance photocatalytic activity in the visible than ordinary wo3 however metal doping cause reduction of photocatalytic activity and thermal instability 23 on the contrary doping with non metals such as s p n or c can enhance the surface area and the performance of the wo3 based photocatalyst 20 24 more so introduction of non metal onto lattice structure of wo3 usually caused bonding of p states and 2p states of non metal and oxygen in w this orbital interaction resulted to upwards shifting in the valence band edge and reduction in the band gap recently immobilization of metal and non metal have been predicted as a feasible alternative to modify wo3 nanostructure for better performance under visible light 25 in this study aluminium and boron were selected as co dopants for the synthesis of wo3 due to their low toxicity availability of the material tendency to replace oxygen and ability to suppress electron hole recombination rate and by extension lowering the band gap energy of wo3 22 26 boron has the potential of forming local network structures and surface active sites for photocatalytic reactions 27 thus it is expected that combination of al and b material will improve the quantum efficiency and photocatalytic activity of wo3 wo3 nanoparticles have been synthesized by various physical and chemical methods such as solvothermal reduction 19 hydrothermal 28 sol gel 29 non sputtering and electrochemical technique 29 catalytic chemical vapour deposition photo reduction and deposition and others 15 30 however these methods are costly generate toxic byproducts and require complex synthetic procedures as well as high pressure and energy 31 conversely green synthesis involving the uses of plant extracts for the preparation of nanoparticles has several advantages such as presence of metabolites when compared to other methods these phytochemical constituents are responsible for the stabilization capping and reduction of metals from their respective oxidation state to zero valence state 32 carrica papaya belongs to family caricaceae known as papaya paw paw kates and papaw is rich in vitamins phenols proteolytic acts as good antioxidant reducing and antimicrobial

coupled wo3 under different light sources such as methylene blue pdo wo3 15 methylene blue p wo3 18 methylene blue pt wo3 36 4 nitrophenol b wo3 22 our research group had earlier reported the photocatalytic degradation of local dyeing wastewater by p i wo3 and ag2o b2o3 tio2 nanocomposites 37 38 however toxicity test of untreated and treated wastewater was not carried out the role of al and b on the morphology optical textural and catalytic properties of wo3 nanoparticles was not examined however no comprehensive report on the potentials of al b immobilized wo3 nanoparticles for the degradation of organic pollutants in local dyeing wastewater under natural sunlight has been reported to date herein the present study report for the first time the preparation of al b immobilized wo3 nanoparticles using green wet impregnation method the prepared al b wo3 nanocomposites were characterized using several analytical techniques this was followed by the photodegradation of the local dyeing wastewater by the prepared wo3 nanoparticles and al b wo3 nanocomposites under natural sunlight irradiation by measuring change in indicator parameters toc and cod level as a function of time

al doped wo3 nanoparticle was carried out by mixing 10 ml of 0 05 mol l 1 aluminium oxide solution drop wise with the prepared wo3 nanoparticles and stirred continuously on magnetic stirrer at 1000 rpm for 2 h subsequently the mixture was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 15 min and washed several times with distilled water and further centrifuged at 1000 rpm the separated sample was oven dried at 80 c for 3 h and later calcined at 550 c in a furnace for 2 h 14 this procedure was repeated using 0 1 mol l 1 and 0 2 mol l 1 of aluminium oxide as dopant secondly the preparation of b doped wo3

lynxeye detector and cukα x ray source the morphology and elemental composition of the prepared samples were obtained using zeiss auriga high resolution scanning electron microscope hrsem fitted with a secondary electron detector and an energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds option high resolution transmission electron microscopy model zeiss auriga operated at acceleration voltage of 20 kv was used to examine the microstructure and particle size uv visible spectroscopy in this case the shimadzu uv 1800 was used to determine the wavelength of absorption the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy surface was used to examine the surface oxidation state of the elements in the samples the specific surface area of the synthesized undoped and doped wo3 nanoparticles were determined using a nova 2400e by applying n2 as an adsorbate on a micrometer asap 2020 chemisorption surface area analyzer 2 5 adsorption photolysis and photocatalytic studies prior to photocatalytic activity experiments a control blank experiment was carried out by exposing local dyeing wastewater alone to sunlight irradiation as well as prepared catalyst alone in the dark without sunlight for the adsorption experiment 0 05 g of each prepared catalyst was added to 100 cm3 of the local dyeing wastewater in a 250 cm3 conical flask the flask was corked and stirred on a magnetic stirrer at 200 rpm for 6 h in the dark to allow for sample homogeneity the solution 20 cm3 was sampled periodically at regular interval of 1 h and immediately analyzed for cod and toc this was done to establish that the percentage degradation or removal of the organic compounds in the wastewater was due to adsorption only in addition another control experiment was carried out by exposing 100 cm3 of the local dyeing wastewater to sunlight irradiation in the absence of the prepared catalyst and stirred with a magnetic stirrer at 200 rpm for 6 h again 20 cm3 of the solution was periodically sampled at regular interval and analyzed for cod and toc in order to establish that the percentage degradation of the local dyeing wastewater was via photolysis alone the photocatalytic activities of the synthesized catalysts were evaluated via the degradation of organic compounds in local dyeing wastewater under natural sunlight irradiation for each experiment 10 mg of the prepared wo3 al doped wo3 b doped wo3 and al b doped wo3 were added separately into 250 cm3 beakers each containing 100 cm3 of local dyeing wastewater the mixtures were stirred at 200 rpm for 1 h in darkness to allow for adsorption desorption process prior to exposure to sunlight irradiation thereafter the mixture was exposed to sunlight 252 92 w m2 at 36 c and agitated on a magnetic stirrer for 6 h a volume of 20 cm3 of the solutions were sampled simultaneously at interval of 1 h and immediately analyzed for cod and toc this was done to establish whether the degradation of the wastewater was due to photocatalysis 2 6 reusability test the regeneration studies for wo3 al wo3 b wo3 and al b wo3 were evaluated using 0 1 mol l 1 naoh solution as a desorption medium by adding 10 mg each of the dyeing water adsorbed nanoparticles to 100 cm3 of 0 1 mol l 1 naoh the mixtures were stirred continuously for 30 min at ambient temperature and copiously washed with deionized water to remove the desorbing species thereafter the regenerated wo3 al wo3 b wo3 and al b wo3 were reutilized for 5 cycles to determine the effectiveness of the nanoparticles 2 7 acute toxicity of raw and treated wastewater d magna collected from council for scientific and industrial research csir stellenbosch south africa were first cultured following korea standard procedures 1 40 cultures were maintained in a growth chamber at 21 1 c and 16 h light 8 h dark photoperiod was employed the media were changed every 2 days and the daphnids were fed daily with 5 ml yeast ceropyll tetramin and 3 ml living chlorella water qualities of the culture media were maintained as follows ph 7 4 7 8 hardness 80 100 mg l 1 as caco3 and alkalinity 57 64 mg l 1 as caco3 the acute toxicity test was performed as follows 10 ml of undiluted raw and treated wastewater were measured independently into 6 separate well plates followed by the introduction of 10 active d magna neonates 12 h after birth aerated tap water was used as the control and the experiment was monitored for 48 h of exposure 12 h illumination d daphnia species were not fed during the period under investigation after the exposure period the number of inhibited d magna in each group was counted and recorded the acute toxicities unit tu expressed as growth inhibition with no response to the movement of water was calculated using eq 1 1 tu 100 lc 50 where the values of lc50 were estimated at 24 and 48 h using probit analysis and later put into eq 1 to obtain tu the probit programme version 1 5 was used to perform the calculations and the results were obtained at 95 confidence limits 12 13 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of nanoparticles 3 1 1 hrsem analysis of undoped and al doped wo3 nanoparticle hrsem analysis of the synthesized al doped wo3 nanoparticles and the micrograph obtained at different concentration of aluminium is shown in fig 1 b d unlike the undoped wo3 nanoparticle with highly dispersed less aggregated spherical shape fig 1 a plate like morphologies were noticed when 0 05 mol l 1 of aluminium precursor was incorporated onto the lattice layer wo3 nanoparticles fig 1 d when the concentration of aluminium precursor was increased to 0 1 mol l 1 uniformly distributed agglomerated spherical with less ring like structure were observed in the case of 0 2 mol l 1 al doped wo3 nanoparticle mixture of agglomerated spherical and spheres ring like shape was observed the changes in morphology of undoped wo3 from spherical to mixture of agglomerated spherical and ring like shape may be due to aluminium doping effect this can be explained in terms of small ionic radius of al 0 535 å as compared to w 2 02 å and o 1 207 å which diffused easily into the pores of wo3 nanoparticles the al dopant exhibited adsorption phenomenon onto charge energy distribution tungsten surface which in turn affect the crystal growth and morphological transformation behavior of wo3 nanoparticles 42 it should be noted that as the concentration of aluminium precursor increase the proportions of spherical shapes outweighed the plate like structures this means that morphological changes was a function of concentration of aluminium oxide in the matrix of wo3 nanoparticle the average particle sizes of 0 05 mol l 1 0 1 mol l 1 and 0 2 mol l 1 al doped wo3 nanoparticle were in ascending order of 28 3 nm 18 6 nm 21 1 nm this indicates that at high concentration of 0 2 mol l 1 of aluminium was able to penetrate into the lattice structure of the wo3 without completely changed the morphology and structure of wo3 nanoparticle which agreed with the findings of prabhu et al 43 3 1 2 hrtem with corresponding saed of al doped wo3 nanoparticles the hrtem with micrographs at high and low magnification with their respective saed images of al doped wo3 nanoparticles are presented in fig 2 for 0 05 mol l 1 al doped wo3 shown in fig 2 a highly agglomerated particles were formed in contrast dense spherical and cubic structures were noticed for wo3 nanoparticles doped with 0 1 and 0 2 mol l 1 aluminium precursor the spherical and cubic morphologies increase with increasing concentration of aluminium precursor the changes of morphologies from spherical to cubic may be ascribed to the excessive incorporation of al3 into the host lattice of wo3 this finding is in agreement with the hrsem result in fig 2 e g and the eds result fig 3 additionally the particle size of 0 05 mol l 1 al doped was found to be 18 32 nm and as the concentration of the al dopant increases from 0 1 mol l 1 to 0 2 mol l 1 the average particle size reduced from 16 7 nm to 9 4 nm in the same vein the hrtem images in the set of fig 2 b e and h showed the lattice d spacing as 0 45 nm 0 41 nm and 0 39 nm respectively which correspond to 002 crystal planes the saed patterns demonstrated the presence of continuous clear ring pattern with little additional spots revealing the polycrystalline structure of the al doped wo3 nanoparticles 3 1 3 xrd analysis of al doped wo3 nanoparticles fig 4 b shows the xrd pattern of wo3 doped with different concentration of aluminium the xrd patterns of undoped wo3 nanoparticles have been previously explained in fig 4 b the xrd pattern of 0 05 mol l 1 al doped wo3 nanoparticles showed sharp and intense diffraction peaks at angle 2θ value of 24 00 28 14 42 00 50 00 and 58 02 which correspond to the following crystal planes of 020 200 202 100 110 210 300 and 211 these peaks matched with index pattern of monoclinic phase of wo3 15 18 with an average crystalline size of 17 3 nm according to scherer equation for 0 1 mol l 1 al doped wo3 nanoparticle the diffraction peaks were noticed at 2θ value of 23 13 24 00 24 56 28 12 14 59 28 14 and 28 59 these peaks correspond to the following crystal planes 020 200 100 110 and 101 and matched with the monoclinic phase of wo3 18 the average particle size was found to be 8 2 nm based on scherrer equation the xrd pattern of 0 2 mol l 1 al doped wo3 nanoparticle revealed the presence of high intense peaks at angle 2θ values of 23 13 24 00 28 59 34 20 42 00 and 56 13 which were assigned to the following crystal planes 020 110 101 202 220 112 and 300 these peaks matched with the pattern of monoclinic phase of wo3 whose average crystalline size was 12 02 nm it can be seen that addition of aluminium did not influence change of wo3 phase however responsible for the reduction of crystallite size of wo3 3 1 4 hrsem analysis of b doped wo3 nanoparticles at different concentration the hrsem images of the synthesized boron doped wo3 nanoparticles are shown in fig 5 a d fig 5 a demonstrates the formation of less agglomerated uniform spherical particles unlike fig 5 a it was noticed that when wo3 nanoparticles was doped with 0 05 mol l 1 boron precursor heterogeneously distributed agglomerated spherical ring or slate like shape morphology was observed fig 5 b similar trend was observed for 0 1 mol l 1 boron doped wo3 fig 5 c the evenly distributed agglomerated slate ring like symmetry with small quantity of spherical shapes was observed at higher concentration of 0 2 mol l 1 boron precursor see fig 5 d the change of undoped wo3 from spherical to ring like morphology due to b addition was based on its small ionic radius 0 23 å compared to w and o which distorted or shrinked the lattice and nanostructure of wo3 47 the average particle size decreases as the concentration of the boron dopant increase due to substitution of w or o atoms with b atoms or probably differences in atomic sizes of the elements the average crystallite sizes arranged in ascending order are 18 7 nm 13 4 nm 11 6 nm for 0 05 mol l 1 0 1 mol l 1 and 0 2 mol l 1 b doped wo3 nanoparticles thus at high concentration of 0 2 mol l 1 more boron penetrated the lattice layer and caused morphological structural changes of wo3 nanoparticles than when 0 05 mol l 1 and 0 1 mol l 1 were used 3 1 5 hrtem eds saed analysis of b doped wo3 nanoparticles high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem micrographs at high 2 nm and low 50 nm magnification and saed images of the synthesized b doped wo3 nanoparticles are shown in fig 6 fig 6 a revealed the presence of evenly distributed agglomerated spherical particles while fig 6 d showed heterogeneous and aggregated spherical and cubic shape in the case of fig 6 g which is 0 2 mol l 1 b doped wo3 nanoparticles heterogeneous mixture of spherical and cubic were observed it can be seen that an increase in the concentration of boron from 0 05 mol l 1 to 0 2 mol l 1 was responsible for the morphological transformation from spherical to mixture of spherical and cubic structure these microstructural changes were ascribed to the diffusion and b substitution of w resulted to distortion and internal stress in the wo3 host lattice as the concentration of boron dopant increase to 0 1 mol l 1 the average crystallite size reduced to 8 4 nm and similar trend of size reduction was observed as the concentration increase to 0 2 mol l 1 to average crystallite size 5 6 nm the reduction of particle size as the concentration of b increases corroborated the findings of 27 and 41 the hrtem images in the insets fig 6 b e and h show the lattice d spacing as 0 35 0 37 and 0 42 nm respectively which correspond to the 002 interplanar distances and further support planes of monoclinic wo3 the presence of lattice fringes at high magnification further confirmed that the synthesized materials were highly crystalline as can be seen in the saed patterns fig 6 c 6 f and 6 i which demonstrate the appearance of continuous ring patterns and bright diffraction spots energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds was done to investigate elemental composition of the as synthesized b doped wo3 nanoparticles at different concentration of boron and the eds result is displayed in fig 7 the eds results revealed atomic percentage of tungsten oxygen carbon and boron the level of w reduces as the concentration of the dopant b increase while no b was detected non detection of b suggests successful diffusion and penetration of the b onto the inner pores of wo3 nanoparticles this is because the ionic radii 0 23 å and atomic weight 10 8 of b is smaller than that of w and o the incorporation of b caused distortion and overlapping of the monoclinic planes of wo3 and subsequent transformation to ring or plate like morphology phase respectively 3 1 6 x ray diffraction analysis of b doped wo3 nanoparticles the xrd patterns of wo3 nanoparticles doped with different concentrations of boron are shown in fig 8 b d the xrd pattern of un doped wo3 nanoparticle a showed sharp diffraction peaks 001 020 200 and 202 crystal plane that correspond to 2θ value of 23 13 24 00 and 28 12 respectively these diffraction peaks matched with the index pattern of monoclinic phase of wo3 with the jcpds card no 83 0947 and average crystalline size of 17 32 nm 18 for 0 05 mol l 1 b doped wo3 the diffraction peaks were noticed at 2θ value of 23 13 24 00 24 56 28 12 28 14 and 28 59 respectively these peaks correspond to the following crystal planes 002 020 200 202 100 110 and 101 and matched with the monoclinic phase of wo3 the average particle size was determined to be 14 3 nm furthermore there was no significant difference when 0 1 mol l 1 boron precursor was introduced onto the lattice layer of wo3 nanoparticles in fact weak diffraction peaks observed at 2θ value of 23 13 24 00 24 56 28 12 28 59 50 00 56 13 and 76 00 these were ascribed to 002 020 200 202 110 101 221 311 and 322 crystal planes and depicts the formation of monoclinic phase of wo3 the average crystallite size was calculated using scherer equation and found to be 9 2 nm in the case of 0 2 mol l 1 b doped wo3 nanoparticle the xrd pattern revealed main characteristics peaks at 2θ value of 14 59 23 13 24 00 28 14 28 59 28 12 42 00 56 13 and 76 00 which were assigned to miller indices of 100 002 020 110 101 202 220 112 221 311 and 322 these peaks matched properly with monoclinic wo3 phase with average crystalline size of 6 4 nm it can be noticed that slight difference exists in the diffraction pattern of the undoped and b doped wo3 nanoparticles precisely the peak intensity for monoclinic phase reduced with increasing amount of boron dopant this clearly support the hrsem result fig 5 b d as evidence in the morphological transformation from completely spherical shape to ring or plate like structures comparatively the intensity of the diffraction peaks slightly reduced compared to either by w or o in wo3 monoclinic because of the smaller ionic radii of b 0 23 å than w 2 02 å and o 1 207 å although substitution of w by b is still a subject of further investigation due to the mismatching of oxidation state between b3 and w6 27 it is evident that not all the b were involved in doping activities as some formed oxides with its self b2o3 and existed as cluster on the surface of wo3 nanoparticle fig 5 b d this implies that concentration of boron dopant influenced the morphology and the crystalline sizes of synthesized wo3 however did not change its phase 3 1 7 hrsem hrtem saed micrograph of undoped and al b doped wo3 nanoparticles the hrsem hrtem saed micrograph of the undoped wo3 and al b co doped wo3 nanocomposites is shown in fig 9 fig 9 a revealed the formation of purely spherical shapes which correspond to monoclinic phase while in the case of al b doped wo3 nanocomposite partial destruction of the spherical shapes was noticed due to simultaneous diffusion and substitutional mechanism of aluminium and boron resulting to internal structural grain boundaries and stress adjustment of lattice crystal of wo3 caused by the entity of the two dopants 46 48 this finding is supported by eds results of the nanocomposites fig 10 this implies that the changes in shape of wo3 nanoparticle suggest inner penetration and surface deposition of al and b based on their equal number of electron the hrtem micrographs at high 2 nm and low 50 nm magnification and saed images are presented in fig 9 c e the hrtem image fig 9 c demonstrated the presence of dense agglomerated tiny particles due to destruction of spherical morphology observed for undoped wo3 nanoparticles and may be attributed to the penetration of al3 and b3 based on their equal number of valence electrons onto the host lattice of wo3 in addition the saed pattern revealed the formation of ring patterns thus suggest that al b co doped wo3 is of high crystallinity 3 1 8 xrd analysis of undoped wo3 and al b doped wo3 nanocomposites fig 11 depicts the xrd pattern of undoped wo3 and al b doped wo3 nanocomposites the xrd pattern of un doped wo3 nanoparticle demonstrated the formation of sharp and intense diffraction peaks at 2θ value of 23 12 24 00 24 56 and 28 12 which correspond to 002 020 200 and 202 crystal plane these peaks matched well with the monoclinic phase of wo3 with average crystalline size of 17 32 nm while the xrd pattern of al b doped wo3 nanocomposites revealed the presence of sharp but weak diffraction peaks at 2θ value of 23 13 24 00 27 02 28 00 34 02 50 00 and 57 00 with the following crystal planes 002 020 200 110 202 210 300 and 221 these peaks matched properly with monoclinic phase of wo3 whose average crystalline size was 21 1 nm the slight increase in particle size may be ascribed to the doping and synergetic effect between the two dopants 18 none detection of al or b in the composite material implies that the concentration of the two dopants was low or below the detection limit of the instrument the addition of the two dopants did not distort the phase of wo3 3 1 9 uv visible diffuse reflectance analysis and bandgap energy calculation the uv visible diffuse reflectance analysis of wo3 al doped wo3 b doped wo3 and al b doped wo3 nanocomposites in the wavelength range of 200 800 nm is presented in fig 12 a while fig 12 b depicts the tauc s plot of the band gap energies of undoped wo3 and co doped wo3 nanocomposites as shown in fig 12 a it can be seen that the absorption edge of the uv visible diffuse reflectance spectra shifted to a higher wavelength red shift b wo3 the slight red shift observed may be due to the simultaneous doping of al and b onto the wo3 nanoparticles in addition the red shift may be linked to the charge transfer transition between the al and b electrons and the conduction or valence band of wo3 the electrons transfer occurred between 2p and 5d orbital for b and w and 3p and 5d orbitals of al and w respectively similar findings were reported by 44 and 45 the shift from 500 510 nm to the visible region may be ascribed to the suppression of the rate of recombination of electron hole pairs in the wo3 nanoparticles by aluminium and boron on the contrary the absorbance edge of the bare wo3 nanoparticles was approximately at wavelength of 500 nm while that of the b wo3 was less than the ordinary wo3 which means that for the mono doped material the absorption threshold shifted to a much lower wavelength 500 nm due to burstein moss effect and less energetic interaction between electron in 2p orbital of b and electrons in 5d orbital of w 14 the al doped wo3 absorbs at a longer wavelength than wo3 alone attributable to the doping effect of al into the interstitial layer of wo3 based on ionic radius mechanism al3 0 05 nm and w6 0 065 nm the shift to higher wavelength noticed for al doped wo3 sample may be linked to strong interaction between energetic 3p electrons in al and 5d electrons in w compared with the undoped wo3 the absorption bands of al doped wo3 and al b doped wo3 nanomaterials were greater than wo3 alone this red shifts and enhancement of absorbance of the two materials may be explained based on the basis of simultaneous charge transition between al3 and b3 electrons and wo3 conduction or valence band the energy band gap eg values were obtained from the absorption coefficient calculated as a function of photon energy hv the relationship between the absorption coefficient and photon energy is expressed in eq 2 2 ahv 2 c hv eg where c is a constant and can be calculated using expression α a d where a is the absorbance and d is the thickness of the sample in the uv visible cell the band gap energy of the synthesized nanocomposites was obtained by extrapolating the linear portion of the graph αhv 2 versus hv as shown in fig 12 b the band gap energy of 2 42 ev for the synthesized wo3 in this study is lower than 2 61 ev reported by li et al 46 who prepared wo3 via hydrothermal method wo3 is an n type semiconductor with band gap energy in the range of 2 6 ev to 3 2 ev 47 the differences in the band gap energy may be ascribed to the different method of synthesis and reaction conditions which determined the morphology and the crystalline nature of the material in addition doping effect of carbonaceous materials from the plant extract used during the synthesis produced new crystal defects and localized states and as such may be responsible for the lower band gap energy reported in this study the band gap energy for b wo3 al wo3 al b wo3 were 2 70 ev 2 20 ev 1 7 ev respectively the reduction in band gap energy of the wo3 may be due to doping effect of boron and aluminium which increased oxygen vacancies this suggests that al b wo3 composites with the smallest band gap value may exhibit excellent photocatalytic properties under sunlight than others 3 1 10 brunauer emmett teller bet analysis of the prepared nanomaterials the specific surface area m2 g and pore size of the synthesized wo3 al wo3 b wo3 and al b wo3 were determined using n2 adsorption desorption bet method and corresponding curves is shown in fig 13 a and b according to iupac the four samples exhibited a type iv isotherm with an h1 type hysteresis loop linked to open ended cylindrical pores an indication of mesoporosity over micro or macroporosity 31 the pore size distribution of four samples revealed the presence of mesopores with pore diameter in the 3 2 88 nm see fig 13 b the measured specific surface area and pore size of the prepared nanomaterials is shown in table 1 from table 1 it can be noticed that the surface area of the nanomaterials increased in the order of al b wo3 al wo3 wo3 while an opposite trend was observed for the pore sizes the bet surface area value of the wo3 increases slightly when aluminium and boron dopant were mono doped however the introduction of aluminium and boron as co dopants significantly enhanced the surface area from 22 49 m2 g to 63 94 m2 g the increment in surface area may be due to the intercalation of the al3 and b3 in the lattice structure of the wo3 44 47 another possible reason may be linked to no change or distortion of the monoclinic phase and the symmetry of the wo3 3 1 11 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis the elemental composition and the oxidation states of the as synthesized wo3 al wo3 b wo3 and al b wo3 were determined using xps and the results are shown in fig 14 the following elements w al o b and c were obviously present on the surface of the nanomaterial as shown in fig 14 a typical high energy resolution spectrum of the w 4f region is shown in fig 15 a the 4f energy level splits upon ionization with a spin orbit splitting ratio for the w 4f5 2 and w 4f7 2 levels of 3 4 the fits indicate two doublet peaks the first set 35 6 and 37 6 ev corresponds to a w6 stoichiometric wo3 state and the second 34 2 ev to w4 while the peak at 36 2 ev is assigned to w5 indicates o vacancy and or doped species replacement 17 the first set of peaks for w at binding energies 35 6 and 37 6 ev depicts w6 o bonds in wo3 the sharp peak at 530 5 ev fig 15 b corresponds to the binding energy of o 1s signify the characteristic peak of lattice oxygen o2 in wo3 48 in fig 6b o 1s peak was located at 530 5 ev while in fig 15 d a slight difference in the binding energy in the range of 0 1 0 3 ev was observed for b wo3 and al b wo3 respectively the shift noticed for o 1 s in b wo3 and al b wo3 is similar to that of w4f peak the shifting phenomena may be due to relaxation of w atoms due to the removal of an o atom thereby solidifying the bond of other lattices the apparent slackening reduced the bond length of wo including overlapping of other bonds dangling within the framework of w a shift in binding energies observed in al b wo3 for w 4f and o 1s suggested the existence of strong interaction between w6 and oxygen vacancies studies have shown that oxygen removal based on outward motion from the next nearest neighbour o in wo3 often causes compression of bonds by 20 thus a slight shift noticed for o 1s and w4f have been ascribed to the presence of oxygen vacancies similar phenomenon was observed for wo3 x 17 in the same vein photoelectron doublet peaks of al 2s and al 2p were found at the binding energies of 80 ev and 75 ev respectively fig 15 e confirmed successful incorporation of al onto the surface layer of wo3 this implies that one of the o 1s has been substituted or replaced by al the binding energy peak of b 1s in the fig 15 f located at 190 5 ev revealed that the boron dopant is in trivalent state b3 confirming the successful immobilization of the boron into the lattice structure of the wo3 in summary it was observed that the wo3 sample contain two contributing factors firstly one from w 4f energy enveloped with a stoichiometric wo3 and non stoichiometric contribution wo3 x 31 the non stoichiometric wo3 x is an indication of o vacancies and possible the replacement of the lattice oxygen in wo3 by the two dopants al and b it is well known that the presence of c oh groups on the surface can trap the positive holes and prevent electron hole recombination increasing the mobility and lifetime of the photo generated holes 49 closer inspection of the detail xps carbon 1 s fits see fig 15 g j shows clearly that the al b wo3 specimen has a high c oh peak indicated with arrow compared to the other specimens this is followed by the al wo3 specimen and the rest has almost no c oh present apart from the surface area and bandgap it looks as if the prevention of electron hole recombination plays the dominant role in the higher photocatalytic activity of al b wo3 3 2 photocatalytic studies the photocatalytic activity of al b doped wo3 nanoparticles on the degradation of local dyeing wastewater was evaluated under sunlight irradiation prior to this the selected physiochemical parameters of the local dyeing wastewater were determined and the result is shown in table 2 comparing the raw values with the permissible limits set by world health organisation who 50 it is clear that the collected dyeing wastewater is not safe for both human and aquatic species and therefore must be treated before direct discharge into the environment the unpleasant odour and colour in the raw dyeing wastewater were ascribed to the presence different organic and inorganic materials such as detergents fabric whiteners and others used in the dyeing operations the ph value of the raw wastewater was 9 5 which mean the wastewater is alkaline and slightly higher than the recommended value by who 50 and higher value of ph may be linked to excessive use of carbonates bicarbonates sodium hydroxide and bleaching compounds during bleaching process which increase the toxicity not only that the tds value is also high above the permissible limit which suggests high amount of suspended solids in the water used during the dyeing operation 51 52 high amount of suspended solids is problematic for treatment and thus the collected wastewater was subjected to filtration before photocatalytic process according to reddy and osborne 53 electrical conductivity ec is the potential of chemical substances to possess electrons and this depends on amount of ionic salts and dissolved solids in this case it was found that the ec of untreated and treated wastewater selected was less than the permissible limits 1000 2000 μm2 cm high amount of ec in water did not support the survival of aquatic species based on the initial bod toc and cod value it can be inferred that the wastewater contains several toxic organic and inorganic compounds which must be decomposed into co2 and h2o table 2 also shows that the dyeing wastewater contain several anions and cations with sulphate as the predominant these anions and cations are classified as radical scavengers which compete with hydroxyl radicals during photocatalytic oxidation of dyeing wastewater table 2 also reveals the presence of five toxic heavy metals and the order of occurrence of the metals were zn cr fe ni pb this means zinc was the most abundant metal and may be ascribed to high mineral content in water used during dyeing operation similar observation was reported by 50 52 exposure to each of the metals has been linked to different health challenges for instance chromium toxicity can cause liver and kidney disorders while cumulative effect of pb in the body can result to hypertension neurological disorders amongst others table 2 shows significant reduction of the indicator parameters in the presence of wo3 mono doped wo3 and co doped wo3 under sunlight irradiation the co doped wo3 behaved better than undoped wo3 and mono doped wo3 in removal of indicator parameters in dyeing wastewater and the obtained results were lower than the permissible limit of who standard 50 see table 2 it was noticed that the level of conductivity of the treated water is significantly higher than untreated wastewater which suggest the presence of anions and cations in the former than the latter this is an evidence of partial degradation of the organic compounds in the wastewater into harmless species due to their competition with free reactive species for the binding sites during catalytic reaction under sunlight it was generally observed that the concentrations of heavy metals reduced significantly after the photocatalytic treatment of local dyeing wastewater with the prepared nanomaterials the decrease in the amount of heavy metals in the treated water suggests that the prepared nanomaterials also performed as nanoadsorbent it was also noticed that the decrease in the indicator parameters was nanocatalysts dependent the biodegradability of effluent in terms of bod cod is greater than 0 6 when compared to bod cod of less than 0 4 reported by ramos et al 54 this suggests that the treatment of the dyeing wastewater can be conveniently done using promising physicochemical method such as photocatalysis for the removal of cod and toc 54 the reductions of the indicator parameters especially cod and toc in the local dyeing wastewater under the influence of the nanocatalysts as a function of irradiation time under natural sunlight using eq 3 is shown in fig 16 b and c respectively 3 percentage removal c o c t c o 100 where co and ct are initial and residual concentrations of cod and toc at different intervals of irradiation respectively the raw indigenous textile wastewater collected from different pits at the sampling site at different dilution ratios 1 5 10 50 and 70 were subjected to uv visible spectroscopic analysis fig 16 a the uv visible spectra of a dark and light blue colouration revealed appearance of broad peak of maximum absorbance in the range of 619 640 nm this suggests that the dyes used by the locals belong to 7 aryl substituted rhodamines groups 53 no noticeable peak was observed for 1 5 and 10 dye solution due to the dilution effect it was noticed from fig 16 b and c that the concentration of these indicator parameters cod and toc did not change significantly either under natural sunlight irradiation or in the presence of catalyst alone which mean that the degradation of these dye molecules did not follow photolysis and adsorption pathways it can be noticed from the two figs that the degradation efficiency of the organic compounds based on the indicator parameters increases with increasing irradiation time this implies that there is an existence of a direct linear relationship between the nanocatalysts and irradiation time for instance the reduction of cod value of the dye molecules at 240 min was in the order b wo3 78 9 wo3 85 0 al wo3 89 4 al b wo3 94 0 under the same applied conditions the toc reduction level occurred as follows 68 9 73 4 80 9 90 0 for the following photocatalysts b wo3 wo3 al wo3 al b wo3 it is obvious that the degradation rate of al b wo3 for both parameters was faster than other catalysts under the same applied conditions the differences in the photocatalytic behavior of the synthesized materials can be explained in terms of suppression of the electron hole recombination rate of wo3 by the two dopants 9 the higher photocatalytic activity of the al b wo3 nanocomposites with respect to the mono doped and undoped wo3 can also be interpreted in terms of the two added dopants having different energy levels for their corresponding conduction and valence band 15 16 this resulted to the higher interfacial charge transfer efficiency from the dopants to the semiconductor metal oxide leading to faster electron hole separation and higher photocatalytic activity the differences in the overall activity of the nanocatalysts can also be attributed to the loose structural morphology a high surface area evidence of more active and binding sites moderate band gap energy and surface hydroxyl groups for instance al b wo3 with the smallest band gap energy 1 7 ev and higher surface area 533 94 m2 g exhibited better photocatalytic performance than other catalysts due to the existence of synergetic effect between the two dopants in the composite 17 18 in the same vein our results also indicate that al wo3 performed better than b wo3 and undoped wo3 under the same conditions the observed trend can be linked to smaller band gap energy of 2 20 ev al wo3 than 2 42 ev wo3 and 2 70 ev b wo3 14 this implies that nanocatalyst with the lowest band gap prevented the electron hole recombination rate than other and hence responsible for the observed higher photocatalytic activity a close observation of the degradation performance showed higher activity for undoped wo3 than b wo3 this suggests that the content of boron may be responsible for the observed decreased surface area and the photoactivity whereas the doping effect of carbonaceous material from the plant extract onto the frame structure of wo3 enhanced its high oxidation potential under natural sunlight than b wo3 material 14 additionally carbon is neither strong electronegative nor electropositive and thus suppress and retard the promoted and transferred electrons from the valence band to conduction bands of wo3 surface based on lower fermi level mechanism 14 this phenomenon usually created a schottky barrier at the interface between wo3 and carbon which enable free movement of the photo generated electrons from wo3 surface towards the carbon surface not only that the recombination rate of photo generated electrons and holes may be prevented by carbon and as a result favoured enhancement of photocatalytic activity this finding agreed with the previous studies reported by hang et al 45 where 5 fe wo3 exhibited greater photocatalytic efficiency of 93 at an irradiation time of 300 min under visible light irradiation than the undoped alone the performance of the nanocatalysts prepared previously was compared with this present study in table 3 according to table 3 it can be noticed that the photocatalytic behavior of the nanocatalyst depend on the nature of the pollutants surface area and the band gap energy it was found that the catalyst prepared in this study performed better than other catalysts except wo3 reported by wang et al 26 the differences could be ascribed to the nature of the pollutants while this study used real environmental sample containing several organic compounds wang et al 26 used simulated solution which did not contain any radical scavengers or suspended solids again competition for active sites by the organic compounds is limited in the simulated solution compared to real environmental sample used generally it was found that the physicochemical parameters of the raw wastewater reduced considerably after treatment with the various synthesized nanocatalyst the behavior of the nanocatalysts may be linked to the surface area and surface adsorbed functional groups 3 2 1 kinetics studies of the photodegradation of local dyeing wastewater by wo3 photocatalysts the experimental data obtained from the photodegradation of organic compounds in the local dyeing wastewater was fitted into three different kinetic models namely pseudo first order pseudo second order and modified freundlich as presented eqs 4 to 6 the results expressed in terms of correlation coefficient r2 rate constant k error functions sse and x 2 are shown in tables 4 and 5 respectively 4 ln c o c t kt 5 1 c t kt 1 c o 6 c t k c o t 1 m where co and ct are initial and final concentration of the organic compounds in dyeing wastewater t is the reaction time min k is the rate constant and m is a constant according to tables 4 and 5 it is evident that the experimental data best fitted to pseudo first order compared to other models based on the value of correlation coefficient r2 and rate constant k for all the synthesized materials besides correlation coefficient r2 error functions such as sse and x 2 were also used to adjudge the best fitted model to kinetic data and values closer to zero depicts a significant agreement between the experimental and theoretical values the fitness followed the order of al b wo3 al wo3 wo3 b wo3 for both toc and cod in the local dyeing wastewater again the performance of the nanocatalysts may be due to the high surface area and the low band gap of al b doped wo3 than other catalysts this suggests that the decomposition process of the organic compounds in the local dyeing wastewater by the synthesized photocatalyst is monolayer in nature and depends only on one factor the reduction of toc or cod in the local dyeing wastewater depends only on the concentration of the organic compounds additionally the degradation mechanism of the organic compounds is adsorption desorption controlled not only that the photocatalytic mineralization of the dye molecules occurred mostly on the surface of wo3 nanoparticles the differences in the rate constant may be linked to the nature of catalyst method of preparation of the catalyst surface area and band gap energy 3 3 mechanism of al b doped wo3 photocatalysts the improved catalytic efficiency of al b wo3 for the degradation of local dyeing wastewater has been linked to the production of the four reactive species namely o2 superoxy anion oh hydroxyl radical e and h 14 38 during the photocatalytic reactions the organic compounds in the wastewater were adsorbed on the surface of al b wo3 followed by excitation of the dye molecules the electron in the valence band moved to the conduction band of pure wo3 thus creating an electronic vacancy or hole in the valence band in case of al doped wo3 the w6 lattice position was replaced by al3 ions and then lowered the conduction band of wo3 on the contrary addition of b increased the band gap energy of wo3 due to burstein moss effect see fig 17 14 the roles played by the dopants on the enhancement of toc and cod reduction differ and are explained as follows al3 in the composite promoted charge carrier separation efficiency causing migration of al3 to the catalyst surface for o2 photoadsorption boron also accelerated the activity of wo3 under natural sunlight through formation of some favorable local structures and surface active sites during photocatalytic reactions under the influence of natural sunlight irradiation photogenerated electrons from al reach wo3 via b or from b to wo3 via al the photogenerated electrons in al b oxidizes very rapidly to form superoxy anion o2 radicals whereas the holes react with water molecules to produce hydroxyl oh radicals 55 oh is primarily generated via oxidative paths after which due to its strong oxidizing ability these two radicals react with the dye molecules and eventually produced some intermediates co2 and h2o the bandgap energy of pure wo3 was lowered by the addition of al3 and b3 onto the lattice layer of w see fig 17 the two dopants capture electrons during photocatalytic process and as a result recombination of electron hole pair was suppressed and hence enhanced the photocatalytic activity for al b doped wo3 moreover the smaller bandgap energy due to al b dopant can play another role in enhancing the visible light photocatalytic activity of wo3 catalyst the proposed reaction mechanisms for the degradation of organic compounds by al b doped wo3 under natural sunlight irradiation are presented in fig 17 and eqs 7 to 17 7 al b wo 3 hv e cb h vb 8 h 2 o oh h 9 hvb h 2 o oh h 10 hvb oh oh 11 e cb o 2 o 2 12 o 2 2 h e cb h 2 o 2 13 o 2 h h o 2 14 h o 2 h o 2 h 2 o 2 1 2 o 2 15 h 2 o 2 h e cb oh h 2 o 16 oh organic dyes intermediates h 2 o co 2 17 o 2 organic dyes intermediates h 2 o co 2 3 4 toxicity test of local dyeing wastewater to daphnia magna table 2 shows that acute toxicity conducted on untreated local dyeing wastewater using d magna indicator was 5 4 thus suggest that the wastewater is highly toxic and therefore not fit to be released into the environment the toxicity of local dyeing wastewater to d magna could be linked to high level of zn fe cod toc and tds see table 2 these findings support previous work 1 on the contrary it was observed that d magna toxicity decreased after photocatalytic treatment with the following nanomaterials wo3 1 1 b wo3 0 8 al wo3 0 4 and al b wo3 0 2 respectively based on hazard classification system for wastewaters discharged into the aquatic environment it can be concluded that wastewater treated with wo3 alone with tu value of 1 1 has acute toxicity while that treated with b wo3 with tu 0 8 exhibits slight acute toxicity it was found that toxicity unit tu value of local dyeing wastewater treated using al wo3 and al b wo3 show no evidence of acute toxicity because tu value was less than 0 4 56 similar trend was reported by kim et al 57 who reported toxicity reduction using electrocoagulation electroflotation processes the differences in the behavior of the nanocatalysts may be linked to their surface area and band gap energy the daphnia toxicity test showed that treated wastewater had little or almost no toxicity depending on the nanocatalysts after 48 h whereas the raw wastewaters did 3 5 stability and reusability of nanocatalysts cost reduction has been reported as major attribute for the prevention and treatment of pollution due to solid waste at the industrial level 60 sequel to that the photocatalytic regeneration capacity of undoped wo3 b wo3 al wo3 and al b doped wo3 for dyeing wastewater treatment was investigated and the result shown in fig 18 accordingly the photocatalytic activity for dyeing wastewater by undoped wo3 b wo3 al wo3 and al b doped wo3 were nearly 100 in the 1st 2nd and third cycles beyond the third regeneration cycle regeneration ability was observed to be above 85 even after 5th regeneration cycle as observed the photocatalytic activity of the nanoparticles was undoped wo3 85 b wo3 88 al wo3 90 and al b wo3 93 even after the 5th cycle considering cost reduction and the environmental protection undoped wo3 b doped wo3 al doped wo3 and al b doped wo3 showed reliable reusable attribute for photocatalytic degradation of dyeing wastewater from figs 19 and 20 it could be seen that the mineralogical phase and morphology of the nanocatalysts after the 5th cycle was not completely destroyed the slight changes may be occupation of the binding sites by the light and heavy pollutants thus making their core shell structures slightly distorted 4 conclusion in summary separate and simultaneous immobilization of wo3 with al and b were reported the synthesized nanomaterials were examined using several characterization tools the photocatalytic activity of the various prepared nanocatalysts over local dyeing wastewater under natural sunlight irradiation was investigated the acute toxicity of untreated and treated wastewater was tested using d magna based on these the following conclusions were drawn addition of b and al onto wo3 did not distort its monoclinic phase but was responsible for the reduction of band gap energy from 2 42 ev wo3 to 1 70 ev al b doped wo3 al b doped wo3 composite exhibited enhanced photodegradation efficiency better than its ordinary wo3 b wo3 and al wo3 with total organic carbon toc and chemical oxygen demand cod reduction efficiency of 96 5 and 97 3 due to differences in band gap and specific surface area bare wo3 performed better under natural sunlight irradiation than b doped wo3 due to the presence of carbon doping effect in the former than the latter the kinetic data demonstrated that the photodegradation of the dye molecules in local dyeing wastewater by al b doped wo3 nanocomposites was faster than the monodoped wo3 and bare wo3 nanoparticles and the experimental kinetic data obeyed the pseudo first order followed by modified freundlich and pseudo second order model this study demonstrated that al b wo3 nanocomposites could be reusable even after five cycles while daphnia toxicity test showed that treated wastewater had little or almost no toxicity depending on the nanocatalysts after 48 h whereas the raw wastewaters did the toxic nature of the raw wastewater may be due to its complex mixture

13272,the adsorption capacity of adsorbents towards fluoride removal depends on the component of the adsorption system such as optimizing parameters matrix of the adsorbent and entrapped metal oxides in the present study we have developed reduced graphene oxide rgo incorporated cerium silver mixed oxide composite rgo ce ag and ce ag bimetallic oxide for removal of fluoride effectively from the sample solution as well as real water samples our aim of this study is to study the effect of rgo matrix on the adsorption capacity of the bimetallic oxide both these adsorbents were characterized by ftir xrd tga dta fesem edx tem and bet to understand the physiochemical which had been engaged for defluoridation from aqueous solutions the results of surface analysis give the surface area of rgo ce ag and ce ag are 375 and 174 m2 g respectively which clearly shows that the surface area of rgo ce ag composite is much higher as compared to the ce ag oxide and hence its adsorption capacity the adsorption capacity of rgo ce ag and ce ag are 434 78 and 294 11 mg g with 99 5 and 95 7 removal respectively which is consistent with the surface analysis results both the adsorbents shows similar adsorption kinetics follows pseudo second order model and followed freundlich adsorption isotherm i e multilayer type of adsorption mechanism on heterogeneous surface of adsorbent might be due to same entrapping metals the matrix only plays the role of enhancing adsorption sites and surface area graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords defluoridation drinking water rgo ce ag ce ag isotherm models pseudo second order model novelty statement the novelty of the present work is enhanced removal capacity of adsorbent by unique combination of ce ag ag nps over the rgo template do not agglomerate hence provide larger number of active site and thus facilitates the higher adsorption capacity by the synthesized adsorbent the detail adsorption isotherm study establishes the mechanism of fluoride adsorption onto the adsorbent this novel adsorbents developed could able to adsorb fluoride effectively at neutral ph without any additional changes to the water to be treated which helps to be very effective to work in natural water system the results obtained clearly show the importance of the work and it contributes significantly to the current research related to defluoridation around the globe in the present study fluoride can be removed completely i e more than 99 at neutral ph and very low adsorbent dose 1 introduction excess fluoride content in drinking water is a worldwide problem of great concern since its intake causes severe diseases such as skeletal and dental fluorosis deformation of back bones etc 1 2 the fluoride contamination in ground water occurs due to the anthropogenic activities and natural disasters as presence of fluoride in rocks and minerals leached out by weathering process and mix with the surface and ground water the industries using continuously fluoride compounds are discharging the effluents to the natural water system 3 4 thus removal of excess fluoride from drinking water is prime necessity for its consumption as it causes severe health hazard problem to human health however the lower concentrations of fluoride within permissible limit in drinking water have benefits too as it reduces enamel erosion and prevents osteoporosis though several novel adsorbents processes technologies have been developed so far but these are area specific various technologies have been adopted such as chemical precipitation electrochemical process ion exchange and adsorption 5 9 these methods are developed to remove fluoride from the water to fulfill drinking water requirement 10 11 but these methods are very costly need sophisticated instrumentation and tedious process from all the methods mentioned above adsorption method is preferred due to easy operational process low cost and eco friendly nature for the adsorption process the selection of adsorbent needs to be chosen in such a way that the adsorbent should have favorable structures easy separation properties from the water higher active sites for adsorption and higher surface area in the literature number of adsorbents has been used for de fluoridation from nanomaterials to biopolymer based composites such as mixed oxide 13 activated carbon 12 surface modified metal oxides and polymeric materials 14 20 although nano composites of metal oxides show good adsorption capacity but they have limitation of secondary pollutants this limitation is overcome by biopolymer composites but they have low adsorption capacity in recent times a new generation graphene based composites seen to be overcome these problems 21 26 graphene has 2 dimensional thin sheets and its oxide have gained much attention since last decades due to its special features of much higher surface area excellent mechanical electrical and thermal properties 27 29 the graphene is modified by hummers method to form graphene oxide go which is concomitant with higher numbers of functional moieties such as oh cooh and co on its surfaces 30 these groups are responsible for the high capability of complexation of metal ions or scavenging ionic or polar solutes from aqueous solutions but there is a problem of tedious separation from the water since go has high water dispersibility so go has modified with metal and metal oxide nanocomposites for the different field of interest 31 the adsorption capacity of metal oxides can be enhanced by converting the metal oxides into composites with some biological or organic material which further enhances the adsorption capacity of the material 32 33 the multivalent metal oxides are good candidate for fluoride removal studies from the best of our knowledge very few studies have been investigated for the fluoride adsorption by go composite karkar et al have studied the fluoride adsorption by using go fe al oxide hiago composite which shows very less adsorption capacity of 27 75 mg g at ph 7 and 318 k temperature kuang reported fe ooh go nano composite with adsorption capacity of 19 82 mg g and sun et al reported alooh reduced go with removal capacity 118 7 mg g many more graphene based adsorbents were reported in the literature with metal oxide and polymer but none report has been found on ce ag composite also the reported adsorbents have lesser adsorption capacity and low surface area the ag nps or ag based composite has an advantage of no agglomeration and hence higher active site higher active site were responsible for the higher surface area and hence excellent removal capacity we have synthesized ce ag modified with rgo having surface area of 375 m2 g and adsorption capacity of 434 78 mg g the surface area of synthesized rgo higher than rgo ce ag composite which revealed that the metal oxide incorporated in the go layers in the present work we have been studied the influence of rgo onto ce ag metal oxide composite which enhances fluoride removal from the drinking water the synthesized go ce ag and rgo ce ag was characterized for bet fesem tem ftir tga and xrd to understand the changes in the properties of the materials with the adsorption adsorption isotherm and kinetic study have been studied for the adsorption of fluoride and found that the incorporation of reduced graphene oxide tremendously enhances the adsorption process 2 materials and method 2 1 chemical used powder of graphite was utilized for the synthesis of reduced graphene oxide rgo procured from the sigma aldrich ammonium ceric nitrate silver nitrate reagents etc were used of analytical grade the high purity si unit traceable sodium fluoride salt was used for the preparation of fluoride solution all other chemicals such as sodium hydroxide potassium chromate sodium phosphate sodium chloride sodium bicarbonate hydrochloric acid nitric acid etc used in the experiment were from reagent grade merck 2 2 synthesis of reduced graphene oxide rgo hummer s method was used for the synthesis of rgo firstly graphite powder was dissolved in 50 weight solution of sodium nitrate in concentrated sulfuric acid and continuously stirred with maintaining the temperature below 20 c by using an ice bath then solid kmno4 three times than graphite powder amount was added during stirring the solution was stirred for 12 h at room temperature and then again solid kmno4 is added in same amount the reaction mixture was stirred continuously for 2 h in order to oxidize the un oxidized graphite de ionised di water was added in the above mixture to produce yellowish paste and increase the solution temperature up to 98 c with ebullience this diluted solution was further stirred for 4 to 5 h and 30 hydrogen peroxide solution was added into the mixture at last the mixture was filtered washed with mixture of 5 hcl and 30 h2o2 many times finally the obtained precipitates were dried under vacuum at room temperature in desiccator for 4 h and characterize by edx energy dispersive x ray bet brunauer emmett teller fesem fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and xrd x ray diffraction to confirm the properties of synthesizes sheet like solid mass 2 3 synthesis of ce ag and rgo ce ag the ce ag oxide composite was synthesized by simple co precipitation method reported in the 34 35 in three ratios of ce ag 3 1 1 1 and 1 3 the 3 1 ratio of ce and ag was chosen for the present study due to its higher surface area the synthesis of rgo ce ag was done by ultrasonication firstly dried go powder was dispersed into the 100 ml of ethanol and water solution and sonicated for an hour for the complete dispersion of go in the go solution known 3 1 ratio of ce and ag were added and sonicated for 30 min followed by dropwise addition of ammonia solution until ph of the solution increased to approximately 8 after that jelly solution kept left over 24 h under ambient conditions and then filtered washed with di water and dried in muffle furnace at 300 c for 3 h finally dried powder was stored in air tight tubes and used for further experiments the synthesized adsorbents were characterized by bet fesem edx ftir xrd and tga 2 4 fluoride stock solution and reference standard the standard fluoride solution 1000 ppm was made by dissolving 2 21 g of high purity si traceability sodium fluoride salt in di water and make up to the 1000 ml in the volumetric flask exact dilution procedure with 0 01 m nacl solution was used for preparing remaining fluoride solutions for the fluoride analysis certified reference materials crms of fluka bam and bharatiya nirdeshak dravyas bnds the registered crm of csir npl are used throughout the analysis of fluoride and the co ions 2 5 characterization the surface area and pore size distribution of as synthesized adsorbents rgo ce ag and ce ag have been investigated by using brunauer emmett teller bet surface analyzer quantachrome autosorbiq surface analyzer for the surface analysis the sample was degassed 3 h up to 573 k temperature and then cool the sample after that the sample was put in the surface analyzer for the analysis field emission scanning electron microscope fesem was used for the study of morphology of adsorbents before and after adsorption for the morphology study before placing the sample in specimen holder for analysis the samples was first coated on carbon tape and then with gold so as to make the sample conducting the elemental analysis was performed by the energy dispersive x ray edx attached with tescan mira fesem the functionalities and change in the bond lengths in the adsorbents was determined by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir in the range of 400 4000 cm 1 the adsorbent first degassed then mixed with kbr powder to form pellet x ray diffraction xrd analysis was carried out to understand the phase of metal oxide incorporated in the go matrix with cu kα radiation 40 kv 40 ma at a scanning speed of 2 min and a scanning step of 0 02 thermal gravimetric analysis tga were carried out to estimate the thermal stability of the adsorbent 3 batch method fluoride removal studies performed at room temperature with two different adsorbents rgo ce ag and ce ag with same and fixed range parameters ph values from 3 to 9 contact time 10 120 min adsorbent dose varies from 0 1 to 1 g l of fluoride solution initial concentration of 10 100 mg l co ions effect at two concentrations of co ions 10 and 20 mg l with fixed concentration of fluoride solution i e 20 mg l 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh solutions were used for ph adjustment the concentration of fluoride in solutions was analyzed by ion chromatography and ion selective electrode the removal r and removal capacity qe was calculated by using standard equation eqs 1 and 2 1 r c o c e c o 100 2 q e c o c e m v where co ce m v and qe are initial concentration of fluoride residual concentration mass of adsorbent volume of solution and removal capacity having unit mg g respectively further the batch adsorption data is utilized to study the adsorption mechanism and removal rate of fluoride onto rgo ce ag and ce ag the well known adsorption isotherm models have been utilized to study the adsorption process by fitting with the model viz langmuir freundlich d r temkin hasley harkins jura redlich peterson and jovanovich each adsorption isotherm has its own significance for the different adsorption parameters detailed analysis of these adsorption isotherms has been given in the below section of adsorption isotherm study to understand the removal rate of fluoride by both of the adsorbents pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were used 4 result and discussion 4 1 characterization 4 1 1 surface area determination by bet surface analysis of the ce ag and rgo ce ag adsorbents were examined by using nitrogen adsorption desorption curve bet multipoint surface area of rgo ce ag was found to be 375 m2 g which is much higher than ce ag surface area 174 48 m2 g the higher surface area of the go adsorbent provides more adsorption sites consequently enhancing the removal capacity of the adsorbent 36 according to iupac classification of the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm both adsorbent shows type i with hysteresis h3 loop fig 1 this indicates that the adsorbents have mesopores and the mesoporosity with interconnected pores 37 from the analysis of da plots inset of fig 1a the pore size of rgo ce ag and ce ag adsorbent was found to be 8 62 and 6 34 nm respectively the bjh method was utilized to analyze the average pore diameter and total pore volume which comes out to be 1 5 nm and 0 439 cm3 g for rgo ce ag adsorbent while 1 7 nm and 0 283 cm3 g for ce ag respectively the langmuir surface of rgo ce ag and ce ag adsorbent was found 821 816 and 535 07 m2 g respectively 4 1 2 surface analysis using fesem tem and edx the surface morphology of ce ag and rgo ce ag was analyzed by fesem attached with edx fig 2 a c d shows the surface morphology of rgo ce ag at 500 nm 1 μm and 2 μm scale which shows that the spherical shaped ce ag entrapped into the voids of graphene oxide and accumulated over the go layers fig 4a shows the fesem images of ce ag which shows spherical shape of adsorbent these sphere shapes were maintained during the synthesis of rgo ce ag but after the fluoride adsorption these spheres seems to made clumps over the go layer due to more accumulation of fluoride over the ce ag as well as the left voids of the go which easily seen in the fig 3 a c d at three scale of 500 nm 1 μm and 2 μm respectively from tem images fig 2 e f it was found that particle size lie in between 10 and 30 nm and it is clearly visible that ceo2 and ag2o nanoparticles were attached onto rgo further the compositions of rgo ce ag adsorbent was analyzed before and after the adsorption of fluoride using edx and shown in the figs 2b and 3b respectively the weight percentage of c o ce and ag in rgo ce ag adsorbent before adsorption is 13 76 23 24 55 13 and 7 82 respectively and atomic percentage of c o ce and ag is 37 38 47 42 12 83 and 2 36 the weight percentage of c o ce and ag in rgo ce ag adsorbent after adsorption is 13 88 25 56 52 56 and 5 43 respectively and atomic percentage of c o ce and ag is 35 16 48 61 10 67 and 1 46 the weight

peak at 430 58 and 473 43 resembles with mf m ce ag shown in the fig 4b 34 35 4 1 4 structural parameter analysis using xrd fig 5 a b shows the xrd pattern of the rgo ce ag which shows that in the go

34 0394 ceo2 and 75 2078 r go 4 1 5 thermal parameter study using tga tga analysis of the rgo ce ag composite was done on mettler toledo tga dsc 1600 at a constant heating rate of 10 c min in air shown in fig 6 a which shows the thermal stability of the adsorbent the thermal curve shows two degradation steps the rgo ce ag composite shows 10 weight loss in the first degradation step in temperature range of 30 180 c owning to loss of physical adsorbed water or the moisture content of the adsorbent while in the second degradation step abrupt weight loss of 35 around 200 c which might be due to removal of co and co2 and steam from the functional group present in the go layer of composite third weight loss between 200 and 800 c due to rupture of metal hydroxides so from the thermal analysis synthesized adsorbent was thermally stable up to 180 c which is favorable for adsorption study fig 6 b shows tga curve of ce ag in first degradation step 15 weight loss occurs in temperature range of 40 180 c corresponding to loss of adsorbed water the second degradation takes place at around 250 c corresponding to loss of adsorbed gases 4 1 6 zeta potential study from the zeta potential graph of rgo ce ag fig s1b it is clear that at ph below 7 5 the overall charge on adsorbent surface was positive favouring the adsorption of fluoride due to electrostatic attraction whereas at ph above 7 5 the surface of adsorbent became negative which results in electrostatic repulsion between adsorbent and fluoride ions as a result decreased adsorption capacity from the zeta potential graph of rgo ce ag fig s1b it is clear that at ph below 7 5 the overall charge on adsorbent surface was positive favouring the adsorption of fluoride due to electrostatic attraction whereas at ph above 7 5 the surface of adsorbent became negative which results in electrostatic repulsion between adsorbent and fluoride ions as a result decreased adsorption capacity 4 2 batch mode adsorption experimental study 4 2 1 ph study the ph effect on the fluoride removal by rgo ce ag and ce ag from contaminated water having initial fluoride concentration 10 ppm was tested with adsorbent dose 0 8 g l optimum contact time 90 min which is presented in the fig 7 the maximum r for rgo ce ag and ce ag adsorbent was observed at 7 ph value i e 99 01 and 95 2 respectively with increase in the ph of the solution r slightly decreases and found to be 95 and 85 2 at ph 9 for both the adsorbents rgo ce ag and ce ag respectively the r at ph value 3 was observed as 83 for rgo ce ag and 79 in case of ce ag this can be explained as in acidic medium the adsorbents carry positive charge due to protonation of hydroxyl group while in basic medium deprotonation of adsorbent take place which is responsible for negative surface charge 45 46 so acidic medium favors the fluoride removal and vice versa for basic medium these results show that the adsorbents work fairly good at ph value 7 which is suitable for the drinking water purpose 4 2 2 adsorbent dose study the effect of rgo ce ag and ce ag dose on the fluoride removal was done at ph 7 with water having initial fluoride ion concentration 10 ppm optimum contact time 90 min presented in the fig 8 r increases from 71 to 99 08 and 52 4 to 95 6 respectively as the dose increase from 0 1 to 1 2 g l in particularly r dramatically increase from 71 to 98 2 and 52 4 to 92 5 as dose increase from 0 1 to 0 8 g l which is related to the availability of active binding sites and surface area however slight increase in r was observed from 0 8 to 1 2 g l dose which might be owning to saturation of active sites or the decrease of fluoride concentration in the solution this fact is explained by the surface site heterogeneity model which says that the availability of high energy sites may decrease with a larger fraction of lower energy sites occupied at a high adsorbent dose 47 49 4 2 3 contact time and initial concentration study the effect of contact time on the adsorption of fluoride onto rgo ce ag and ce ag was studied with water having initial fluoride ion concentration 10 ppm at ph 7 adsorbent dose 0 8 g l and optimum contact time 90 min it signifies that adsorption occurs as the function of time which is clearly reveals in the fig 9 a b with initial increase in contact time the adsorption is very rapid up to the time of 60 min due to strong attraction between adsorbate and adsorbents further with the time the process reaches equilibrium and the adsorption of fluoride slow down attributed to the reduction of active sites the rgo ce ag and ce ag adsorbent reaches equilibrium in 90 min the r and removal capacity of rgo ce ag and ce ag up to 60 min are 76 12 and 95 15 mg g and 71 52 and 89 4 mg g respectively after reaching to equilibrium state the r and removal capacity for rgo ce ag 99 53 and 79 62 mg g in 90 min while for ce ag 95 75 and 78 28 mg g correspondingly fig 9 c d shows the effect of initial concentration on rgo ce ag and ce ag respectively with time removal capacity increases whereas percentage removal decreases this is because with increase in concentration availability of adsorbate and unsaturated active sites of the adsorbent increases 50 51 4 3 kinetic studies kinetics study is very important to understand the adsorption process removal rate of fluoride by the adsorbents adsorption kinetics of fluoride onto ce ag and rgo ce ag are presented in fig 10 and table 1 adsorption of fluoride takes place very fast up to 60 min then slowly decreases well known kinetic models has been utilized i e pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso to study the kinetics of fluoride adsorption onto ce ag and rgo ce ag the linear form of pfo and pso kinetic models are given by eqs 3 and 4 3 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 4 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qe and qt are the fluoride adsorption capacities for the adsorbent in mg g at the equilibrium condition and at time t respectively k1 and k2 are rate constant for first order and second order kinetic modes in min 1 and g mg 1 min 1 on the basis of residual square analysis pso curve fitted best in the adsorption data for the adsorbents the rate of removal of fluoride is very high for second order model i e 818 18 and 320 26 g mg 1 min 1 for rgo ce ag and ce ag respectively second order kinetics refers the chemisorption mechanism of adsorbate and adsorbent interactions these results are consistent with the results of isotherm study i e freundlich is best fitted which also signify chemisorption mechanism with multilayer type of adsorption on heterogeneous surface 4 4 adsorption isotherm study to understand the adsorption behavior of fluoride on two adsorbents completely the isotherm study has been carried out and the result are fitted to various numbers of isotherm model figs 11 12 as described below one after another the adsorption isotherms determined the adsorbate amount which attach at the active sites of the adsorbents at fixed temperature and to examine the mechanism of adsorption langmuir model is based on the homogeneous nature of the adsorbent for the active sites according to the eqs 5 and 6 this isotherm is based on monolayer adsorption of adsorbate on the adsorbent linear equation of langmuir isotherm is 5 1 q e 1 k l q m c e 1 q m 6 r l 1 1 k l co where ce is equilibrium concentration of solute in mg lqm is maximum capacity of adsorption in mg g when the adsorbent homogeneous surface covered with adsorbate fluoride specieskl l g is langmuir constant which determine the energy of the adsorption in l mgrl

isotherm linear equation of jovanovich as per eq 14 is 14 ln q e ln q m k f c e among all the adsorption isotherm model analysis both the adsorbents behave differently on the basis of r2 analysis the adsorption data better fits for both rgo ce ag and ce ag adsorbent is as in the order in case of adsorption isotherm carried out with rgo ce ag adsorbent is as follows redlich peterson 0 95 freundlich 0 94 hasley 0 94 harkins jura 0 90 langmuir 0 89 d r temkin 0 88 jovanovich 0 80 in case of adsorption isotherm carried out with ce ag adsorbent is as follows freundlich 0 98 hasley 0 98 redlich peterson 0 91 harkins jura 0 89 jovanovich 0 86 temkin 0 85 d r 0 81 langmuir 0 80 both the adsorbents fitted better for freundlich isotherm fig 11b which exhibited heterogeneous surface of adsorbent with multilayer type of adsorption further the d r and temkin isotherm models reveal physical adsorption due to the electrostatic interaction between the opposite charges present in the adsorbate and adsorbent the study therefore reveals that the adsorbent is heterogeneous in nature and multiple processes control the overall adsorption that may be operating simultaneously the intensity factor n signifies better interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent for rgo ce ag than ce ag 1 47 since n value obtained is higher for the go adsorbent i e 2 08 the binding intensity also higher for go adsorbent for adsorbent and fluoride the calculated maximum adsorption capacity for rgo ce ag and ce ag is 434 78 and 294 11 mg g respectively calculated by langmuir isotherm fig 11a these results signify that rgo ce ag adsorbent exhibited higher removal capacity due to its higher surface area and active binding sites of go as compared to ce ag these results prove the significance of successful experimentation for the synthesis of ce ag incorporated in go for the fluoride removal studies the rl found 1 for both the adsorbents means favorable adsorption process temkin isotherm fig 11c also explains the heterogeneous surface of adsorbent both the model fitted good for temkin as compared to langmuir which favors homogeneous surface of adsorbent the constant b is related to the heat of adsorption during the process rgo ce ag requires 33 24 j mol while ce ag requires 24 70 j mol from the d r isotherm fig 11d the removal capacity again higher for the go incorporated adsorbent i e 281 46 mg g for rgo ce ag while 235 09 for ce ag the calculated mean free energy for rgo ce ag and ce ag was 2 6 and 4 34 kj mol which signify the physical forces involve in the adsorption process which reveals from the study of regeneration shows good regeneration ability of adsorbents may be possible as physical adsorption is prevailing phenomenon fig 12 a d shows the jovanovich redlich peterson harkins jura and hasley model the value for the redlich peterson exponent nrp obtained is ranged from 0 72 to 0 89 and deviation from the unity indicating fewer tendencies to exhibit saturation behavior as implied by the langmuir isotherm all the adsorption results are summarized in table 2 table 3 shows the comparison of adsorption capacity of present adsorbent with other go based adsorbents obtained from the published data 4 5 speciation studies the mobility of ions and its distribution in the solution can be determined by the speciation studies the speciation study was carried out in the presence of other ions at 20 mg l each with concentration of fluoride 10 mg l with a wide range of ph values the data is used for the speciation calculation and fitted to the model using visual minteq software the species of ions in a broad range of ph values 3 to 11 is plotted and shown in fig 13 very acidic ph the solution contains mostly hf which sharply decreases and almost zero around ph 5 at the ph 3 to 6 5 the fluoride is mostly present in hf2 species of about 60 as below phpzc the surface is positively charged and retains as h ion so fluoride combines due to its high affinity throughout the wide range of ph 100 h2co3 and hco3 species present and about 60 h3po4 is present from ph 7 5 to 13 the other species are present moderate to negligible in whole range of ph 4 6 effect of co ions various ions are present in the groundwater such as cl no3 so4 2 hco3 co3 2 and po4 3 co ions effect on fluoride removal by rgo ce ag and ce ag in the presence of 20 50 and 100 mg l of co ions concentration and 10 mg l of fluoride concentration fig 14 showed that co ions effect the adsorption performance of fluoride by competing with for the active sites due opposite charge of active sites and co ions fluoride adsorption is mainly affected by the po4 3 followed by so4 2 and co3 2 the relative r of fluoride in the presence of 20 50 and 100 mg l phosphate are 85 1 81 46 and 78 and 81 46 78 and 73 for rgo ce ag and ce ag respectively while in the presence of sulphate the values are 87 1 84 5 and 81 and 84 5 81 7 and 78 9 for rgo ce ag and ce ag respectively the r of fluoride was much affected in the presence of po4 3 and so4 2 indicates inner sphere complexation of active sites thus reducing the active sites for the fluoride adsorption the co3 2 increases solution s ph and reduces fluoride adsorption this fact confirmed by ph studies moreover fluoride adsorption was least effected in presence of chloride and nitrate due to outer spherically sorbing anions 4 7 regeneration for an adsorption process regeneration of adsorbent is a significant characteristics property the regeneration of adsorbent is highly dependent on density of oh group which are responsible for fluoride adsorption because active hydroxyl groups either replace by fluoride by ion exchange mechanism or active hydroxyl group adsorb fluoride ion in the present study the exhausted adsorbent was regenerated by different alkali concentration from 0 01 to 0 20 m naoh fig 15a shows the regeneration of rgo ce ag composite and seen to be regenerate effectively at 0 1 m naoh concentration which is equal to the amount of fluoride adsorbed by the adsorbent some of the substituted hydroxide groups do not have activity due to which regeneration efficiency is not 100 fig 15b shows the regeneration cycles vs percentage removal of fluoride with rgo ce ag and ce ag adsorbents as the number of cycle for regeneration increases the efficiency of both the adsorbents decreases with 5 upto 3rd cycle towards the removal of fluoride and in the fifth cycle only 75 fluoride could be removed 4 8 validation in field study the samples were collected from nearby area of north west delhi india the adsorbent dose of 0 1 g has been taken in 100 ml of water sample collected the contents were mixed at room temperature and shaken for 90 min the concentration of fluoride in the water sample was determined and found the fluoride concentration 5 01 mg l after the adsorption experiment the concentration of fluoride in sample was reduced to 0 05 mg l as the natural water sample having many cations and anions so percentage of removal is found to be 99 at 1 0 g l adsorbent dose hence the synthesized adsorbent can be used effectively work for fluoride removal from water having with concentration 5 0 mg l 4 9 mechanism on the basis of the adsorption study experiments and kinetic studies the adsorption of the fluoride over the go adsorbent was occur due to chemisorption as well as physio sorption mechanism and follows the second order rate which means the adsorption process is dependent on the fluoride as well as the active sites of the adsorbent the chemisorption mechanism is possible due to some ion pair formation or h bonding possible between the adsorbent and the fluoride ion and the physiosorption mechanism is possible due to electrostatic interaction between the positively charged active sites of the adsorbent and the negatively charged fluoride ion basically the adsorption mechanism is based on hsab mechanism the adsorption sites act as hard acid while fluoride ion is hard base 4 10 quality assurance of the results the analytical procedure opted to carry out the determination of fluoride as well as other co ions after adsorption experimentation followed a routine calibration of the instrument and corrections of blank the si traceable crms of 1000 mg kg fluoride standard multi anion standard of each 10 mg kg and the bnds are used for calibration and recovery experiment external calibration method was opted with linear regression of r2 0 99 and the removal of fluoride was tested in replicates 5 conclusion graphene oxide go incorporated cerium silver composite and cerium silver bimetallic oxide synthesized by simple chemical precipitation method and further analyzed by number of analytical tools such as fesem edx bet ftir tga and xrd to understand the surface behavior which is responsible for the good adsorption behavior both these adsorbents were show good results and follows same trends in all aspects of adsorption study only the difference in the adsorption capacities due to difference in surface area the surface area of rgo ce ag and ce ag are 375 and 174 m2 g respectively higher surface area of rgo ce ag composite might be due the graphene layers the adsorption capacity of rgo ce ag composite was also much higher than metal oxide composite due to higher surface area and higher number of active sites the percent adsorption and maximum adsorption capacity for rgo ce ag obtained was 99 5 and 434 78 mg g respectively at ph 7 0 while for ce ag it was 95 75 and 294 11 mg g respectively at ph 7 0 both of these follow freundlich adsorption isotherms which signify the multilayer type of adsorption on heterogeneous surface of adsorbent rl value shows favorable adsorption the adsorption process follows the second order kinetics i e both adsorbate and adsorbent are responsible for the adsorption process adsorption isotherm study and kinetic study favors the chemisorption mechanism with multilayer type of adsorption on heterogeneous surface co ion study reveals that the sulphate and phosphate are the interfering ions which effect the adsorption of fluoride due to inner sphere mechanism regeneration of spent adsorbent by utilizing 0 1 m naoh up to 5 cycles with up to 75 thus rgo ce ag is a more suitable adsorbent which is capable to adsorb fluoride up to 99 5 when the initial concentration of fluoride is 10 mg l 0 8 g l adsorbent dose at ph 7 suitable for de fluoridation of drinking water the following is the supplementary data related to this article fig s1 a ftir

13272,the adsorption capacity of adsorbents towards fluoride removal depends on the component of the adsorption system such as optimizing parameters matrix of the adsorbent and entrapped metal oxides in the present study we have developed reduced graphene oxide rgo incorporated cerium silver mixed oxide composite rgo ce ag and ce ag bimetallic oxide for removal of fluoride effectively from the sample solution as well as real water samples our aim of this study is to study the effect of rgo matrix on the adsorption capacity of the bimetallic oxide both these adsorbents were characterized by ftir xrd tga dta fesem edx tem and bet to understand the physiochemical which had been engaged for defluoridation from aqueous solutions the results of surface analysis give the surface area of rgo ce ag and ce ag are 375 and 174 m2 g respectively which clearly shows that the surface area of rgo ce ag composite is much higher as compared to the ce ag oxide and hence its adsorption capacity the adsorption capacity of rgo ce ag and ce ag are 434 78 and 294 11 mg g with 99 5 and 95 7 removal respectively which is consistent with the surface analysis results both the adsorbents shows similar adsorption kinetics follows pseudo second order model and followed freundlich adsorption isotherm i e multilayer type of adsorption mechanism on heterogeneous surface of adsorbent might be due to same entrapping metals the matrix only plays the role of enhancing adsorption sites and surface area graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords defluoridation drinking water rgo ce ag ce ag isotherm models pseudo second order model novelty statement the novelty of the present work is enhanced removal capacity of adsorbent by unique combination of ce ag ag nps over the rgo template do not agglomerate hence provide larger number of active site and thus facilitates the higher adsorption capacity by the synthesized adsorbent the detail adsorption isotherm study establishes the mechanism of fluoride adsorption onto the adsorbent this novel adsorbents developed could able to adsorb fluoride effectively at neutral ph without any additional changes to the water to be treated which helps to be very effective to work in natural water system the results obtained clearly show the importance of the work and it contributes significantly to the current research related to defluoridation around the globe in the present study fluoride can be removed completely i e more than 99 at neutral ph and very low adsorbent dose 1 introduction excess fluoride content in drinking water is a worldwide problem of great concern since its intake causes severe diseases such as skeletal and dental fluorosis deformation of back bones etc 1 2 the fluoride contamination in ground water occurs due to the anthropogenic activities and natural disasters as presence of fluoride in rocks and minerals leached out by weathering process and mix with the surface and ground water the industries using continuously fluoride compounds are discharging the effluents to the natural water system 3 4 thus removal of excess fluoride from drinking water is prime necessity for its consumption as it causes severe health hazard problem to human health however the lower concentrations of fluoride within permissible limit in drinking water have benefits too as it reduces enamel erosion and prevents osteoporosis though several novel adsorbents processes technologies have been developed so far but these are area specific various technologies have been adopted such as chemical precipitation electrochemical process ion exchange and adsorption 5 9 these methods are developed to remove fluoride from the water to fulfill drinking water requirement 10 11 but these methods are very costly need sophisticated instrumentation and tedious process from all the methods mentioned above adsorption method is preferred due to easy operational process low cost and eco friendly nature for the adsorption process the selection of adsorbent needs to be chosen in such a way that the adsorbent should have favorable structures easy separation properties from the water higher active sites for adsorption and higher surface area in the literature number of adsorbents has been used for de fluoridation from nanomaterials to biopolymer based composites such as mixed oxide 13 activated carbon 12 surface modified metal oxides and polymeric materials 14 20 although nano composites of metal oxides show good adsorption capacity but they have limitation of secondary pollutants this limitation is overcome by biopolymer composites but they have low adsorption capacity in recent times a new generation graphene based composites seen to be overcome these problems 21 26 graphene has 2 dimensional thin sheets and its oxide have gained much attention since last decades due to its special features of much higher surface area excellent mechanical electrical and thermal properties 27 29 the graphene is modified by hummers method to form graphene oxide go which is concomitant with higher numbers of functional moieties such as oh cooh and co on its surfaces 30 these groups are responsible for the high capability of complexation of metal ions or scavenging ionic or polar solutes from aqueous solutions but there is a problem of tedious separation from the water since go has high water dispersibility so go has modified with metal and metal oxide nanocomposites for the different field of interest 31 the adsorption capacity of metal oxides can be enhanced by converting the metal oxides into composites with some biological or organic material which further enhances the adsorption capacity of the material 32 33 the multivalent metal oxides are good candidate for fluoride removal studies from the best of our knowledge very few studies have been investigated for the fluoride adsorption by go composite karkar et al have studied the fluoride adsorption by using go fe al oxide hiago composite which shows very less adsorption capacity of 27 75 mg g at ph 7 and 318 k temperature kuang reported fe ooh go nano composite with adsorption capacity of 19 82 mg g and sun et al reported alooh reduced go with removal capacity 118 7 mg g many more graphene based adsorbents were reported in the literature with metal oxide and polymer but none report has been found on ce ag composite also the reported adsorbents have lesser adsorption capacity and low surface area the ag nps or ag based composite has an advantage of no agglomeration and hence higher active site higher active site were responsible for the higher surface area and hence excellent removal capacity we have synthesized ce ag modified with rgo having surface area of 375 m2 g and adsorption capacity of 434 78 mg g the surface area of synthesized rgo higher than rgo ce ag composite which revealed that the metal oxide incorporated in the go layers in the present work we have been studied the influence of rgo onto ce ag metal oxide composite which enhances fluoride removal from the drinking water the synthesized go ce ag and rgo ce ag was characterized for bet fesem tem ftir tga and xrd to understand the changes in the properties of the materials with the adsorption adsorption isotherm and kinetic study have been studied for the adsorption of fluoride and found that the incorporation of reduced graphene oxide tremendously enhances the adsorption process 2 materials and method 2 1 chemical used powder of graphite was utilized for the synthesis of reduced graphene oxide rgo procured from the

was stirred for 12 h at room temperature and then again solid kmno4 is added in same amount the reaction mixture was stirred continuously for 2 h in order to oxidize the un oxidized graphite de ionised di water was added in the above mixture to produce yellowish paste and increase the solution temperature up to 98 c with ebullience this diluted solution was further stirred for 4 to 5 h and 30 hydrogen peroxide solution was added into the mixture at last the mixture was filtered washed with mixture of 5 hcl and 30 h2o2 many times finally the obtained precipitates were dried under vacuum

jovanovich each adsorption isotherm has its own significance for the different adsorption parameters detailed analysis of these adsorption isotherms has been given in the below section of adsorption isotherm study to understand the removal rate of fluoride by both of the adsorbents pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were used 4 result and discussion 4 1 characterization 4 1 1 surface area determination by bet surface analysis of the ce ag and rgo ce ag adsorbents were examined by using nitrogen adsorption desorption curve bet multipoint surface area of rgo ce ag was found to be 375 m2 g which is much higher than ce ag surface area 174 48 m2 g the higher surface area of the go adsorbent provides more adsorption sites consequently enhancing the removal capacity of the adsorbent 36 according to iupac classification of the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm both adsorbent shows type i with hysteresis h3 loop fig 1 this indicates that the adsorbents have mesopores and the mesoporosity with interconnected pores 37 from the analysis of da plots inset of fig 1a the pore size of rgo ce ag and ce ag adsorbent was found to be 8 62 and 6 34 nm respectively the bjh method was utilized to analyze the average pore diameter and total pore volume which comes out to be 1 5 nm and 0 439 cm3 g for rgo ce ag adsorbent while 1 7 nm and 0 283 cm3 g for ce ag respectively the langmuir surface of rgo ce ag and ce ag adsorbent was found 821 816 and 535 07 m2 g respectively 4 1 2 surface analysis using fesem tem and edx the surface morphology of ce ag and rgo ce ag was analyzed by fesem attached with edx fig 2 a c d shows the surface morphology of rgo ce ag at 500 nm 1 μm and 2 μm scale which shows that the spherical shaped ce ag entrapped into the voids of graphene oxide and accumulated over the go layers fig 4a shows the fesem images of ce ag which shows spherical shape of adsorbent these sphere shapes were maintained during the synthesis of rgo ce ag but after the fluoride adsorption these spheres seems to made clumps over the go layer due to more accumulation of fluoride over the ce ag as well as the left voids of the go which easily seen in the fig 3 a c d at three scale of 500 nm 1 μm and 2 μm respectively from tem images fig 2 e f it was found that particle size lie in between 10 and 30 nm and it is clearly visible that ceo2 and ag2o nanoparticles were attached onto rgo further the compositions of rgo ce ag adsorbent was analyzed before and after the adsorption of fluoride using edx and shown in the figs 2b and 3b respectively the weight percentage of c o ce and ag in rgo ce ag adsorbent before adsorption is 13 76 23 24 55 13 and 7 82 respectively and atomic percentage of c o ce and ag is 37 38 47 42 12 83 and 2 36 the weight

the bands between the 500 800 cm 1 i e peak at 521 52 cm 1 corresponds to ceo 39 and peak at 575 68 cm 1 corresponds to ago bond vibration 40 are the characteristics peak of mo after fluoride adsorption each band shifted due to fluoride interaction there are two new peaks arises in the spectra of fluoride adsorbed ce ag between 400 and 500 cm 1 due to cef and agf the broad band around 3400 cm 1 become wider due participation of hydroxyl group in the ion exchange process of fluoride similar type of spectra observed for the rgo ce ag but some extra band appears due to graphene oxide the band around 1645 cm 1 assigned to the bending vibration of oh group 38 the bands at around 1383 cm 1 is assigned for coh stretch of alcohol group 38 41 and 1157 7 cm 1 is attributed to co stretching vibrations of coc respectively 36 the bands between 500 and 800 cm 1 are due to the mo vibrations the broad band appears at 3400 cm 1 is due to oh groups stretching vibration 38 after fluoride

peak at 430 58 and 473 43 resembles with mf m ce ag shown in the fig 4b 34 35 4 1 4 structural parameter analysis using xrd fig 5 a b shows the xrd pattern of the rgo ce ag which shows that in the go

34 0394 ceo2 and 75 2078 r go 4 1 5 thermal parameter study using tga tga analysis of the rgo ce ag composite was done on mettler toledo tga dsc 1600 at a constant heating rate of 10 c min in air shown in fig 6 a which shows the thermal stability of the adsorbent the thermal curve shows two degradation steps the rgo ce ag composite shows 10 weight loss in the first degradation step in temperature range of 30 180 c owning to loss of physical adsorbed water or the moisture content of the adsorbent while in the second degradation step abrupt weight loss of 35 around 200 c which might be due to removal of co and co2 and steam from the functional group present in the go layer of composite third weight loss between 200 and 800 c due to rupture of metal hydroxides so from the thermal analysis synthesized adsorbent was thermally stable up to 180 c which is favorable for adsorption study fig 6 b shows tga curve of ce ag in first degradation step 15 weight loss occurs in temperature range of 40 180 c corresponding to loss of adsorbed water the second degradation takes place at around 250 c corresponding to loss of adsorbed gases 4 1 6 zeta potential study from the zeta potential graph of rgo ce ag fig s1b it is clear that at ph below 7 5 the overall charge on adsorbent surface was positive favouring the adsorption of fluoride due to electrostatic attraction whereas at ph above 7 5 the surface of adsorbent became negative which results in electrostatic repulsion between adsorbent and fluoride ions as a result decreased adsorption capacity from the zeta potential graph of rgo ce ag fig s1b it is clear that at ph below 7 5 the overall charge on adsorbent surface was positive favouring the adsorption of fluoride due to electrostatic attraction whereas at ph above 7 5 the surface of adsorbent became negative which results in electrostatic repulsion between adsorbent and fluoride ions as a result decreased adsorption capacity 4 2 batch mode adsorption experimental study 4 2 1 ph study the ph effect on the fluoride removal by rgo ce ag and ce ag from contaminated water having initial fluoride concentration 10 ppm was tested with adsorbent dose 0 8 g l optimum contact time 90 min which is presented in the fig 7 the maximum r for rgo ce ag and ce ag adsorbent was observed at 7 ph value i e 99 01 and 95 2 respectively with increase in the ph of the solution r slightly decreases and found to be 95 and 85 2 at ph 9 for both the adsorbents rgo ce ag and ce ag respectively the r at ph value 3 was observed as 83 for rgo ce ag and 79 in case of ce ag this can be explained as in acidic medium the adsorbents carry positive charge due to protonation of hydroxyl group while in basic medium deprotonation of adsorbent take place which is responsible for negative surface charge 45 46 so acidic medium favors the fluoride removal and vice versa for basic medium these results show that the adsorbents work fairly good at ph value 7 which is suitable for the drinking water purpose 4 2 2 adsorbent dose study the effect of rgo ce ag and ce ag dose on the fluoride removal was done at ph 7 with water having initial fluoride ion concentration 10 ppm optimum contact time 90 min presented in the fig 8 r increases from 71 to 99 08 and 52 4 to 95 6 respectively as the dose increase from 0 1 to 1 2 g l in particularly r dramatically increase from 71 to 98 2 and 52 4 to 92 5 as dose increase from 0 1 to 0 8 g l which is related to the availability of active binding sites and surface area however slight increase in r was observed from 0 8 to 1 2 g l dose which might be owning to saturation of active sites or the decrease of fluoride concentration in the solution this fact is explained by the surface site heterogeneity model which says that the availability of high energy sites may decrease with a larger fraction of lower energy sites occupied at a high adsorbent dose 47 49 4 2 3 contact time and initial concentration study the effect of contact time on the adsorption of fluoride onto rgo ce ag and ce ag was studied with water having initial fluoride ion concentration 10 ppm at ph 7 adsorbent dose 0 8 g l and optimum contact time 90 min it signifies that adsorption occurs as the function of time which is clearly reveals in the fig 9 a b with initial increase in contact time the adsorption is very rapid up to the time of 60 min due to strong attraction between adsorbate and adsorbents further with the time the process reaches equilibrium and the adsorption of fluoride slow down attributed to the reduction of active sites the rgo ce ag and ce ag adsorbent reaches equilibrium in 90 min the r and removal capacity of rgo ce ag and ce ag up to 60 min are 76 12 and 95 15 mg g and 71 52 and 89 4 mg g respectively after reaching to equilibrium state the r and removal capacity for rgo ce ag 99 53 and 79 62 mg g in 90 min while for ce ag 95 75 and 78 28 mg g correspondingly fig 9 c d shows the effect of initial concentration on rgo ce ag and ce ag respectively with time removal capacity increases whereas percentage removal decreases this is because with increase in concentration availability of adsorbate and unsaturated active sites of the adsorbent increases 50 51 4 3 kinetic studies kinetics study is very important to understand the adsorption process removal rate of fluoride by the adsorbents adsorption kinetics of fluoride onto ce ag and rgo ce ag are presented in fig 10 and table 1 adsorption of fluoride takes place very fast up to 60 min then slowly decreases well known kinetic models has been utilized i e pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso to study the kinetics of fluoride adsorption onto ce ag and rgo ce ag the linear form of pfo and pso kinetic models are given by eqs 3 and 4 3 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 4 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qe and qt are the fluoride adsorption capacities for the adsorbent in mg g at the equilibrium condition and at time t respectively k1 and k2 are rate constant for first order and second order kinetic modes in min 1 and g mg 1 min 1 on the basis of residual square analysis pso curve fitted best in the adsorption data for the adsorbents the rate of removal of fluoride is very high for second order model i e 818 18 and 320 26 g mg 1 min 1 for rgo ce ag and ce ag respectively second order kinetics refers the chemisorption mechanism of adsorbate and adsorbent interactions these results are consistent with the results of isotherm study i e freundlich is best fitted which also signify chemisorption mechanism with multilayer type of adsorption on heterogeneous surface 4 4 adsorption isotherm study to understand the adsorption behavior of fluoride on two adsorbents completely the isotherm study has been carried out and the result are fitted to various numbers of isotherm model figs 11 12 as described below one after another the adsorption isotherms determined the adsorbate amount which attach at the active sites of the adsorbents at fixed temperature and to examine the mechanism of adsorption langmuir model is based on the homogeneous nature of the adsorbent for the active sites according to the eqs 5 and 6 this isotherm is based on monolayer adsorption of adsorbate on the adsorbent linear equation of langmuir isotherm is 5 1 q e 1 k l q m c e 1 q m 6 r l 1 1 k l co where ce is equilibrium concentration of solute in mg lqm is maximum capacity of adsorption in mg g when the adsorbent homogeneous surface covered with adsorbate fluoride specieskl l g is langmuir constant which determine the energy of the adsorption in l mgrl indicate the nature of adsorption rl 1 unfavorable adsorption rl 1 favorable adsorption and rl 0 irreversible adsorption while on the other hand freundlich isotherm predicts the multilayer type of

isotherm linear equation of jovanovich as per eq 14 is 14 ln q e ln q m k f c e among all the adsorption isotherm model analysis both the adsorbents behave differently on the basis of r2 analysis the adsorption data better fits for both rgo ce ag and ce ag adsorbent is as in the order in case of adsorption isotherm carried out with rgo ce ag adsorbent is as follows redlich peterson 0 95 freundlich 0 94 hasley 0 94 harkins jura 0 90 langmuir 0 89 d r temkin 0 88 jovanovich 0 80 in case of adsorption isotherm carried out with ce ag adsorbent is as follows freundlich 0 98 hasley 0 98 redlich peterson 0 91 harkins jura 0 89 jovanovich 0 86 temkin 0 85 d r 0 81 langmuir 0 80 both the adsorbents fitted better for freundlich isotherm fig 11b which exhibited heterogeneous surface of adsorbent with multilayer type of adsorption further the d r and temkin isotherm models reveal physical adsorption due to the electrostatic interaction between the opposite charges present in the adsorbate and adsorbent the study therefore reveals that the adsorbent is heterogeneous in nature and multiple processes control the overall adsorption that may be operating simultaneously the intensity factor n signifies better interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent for rgo ce ag than ce ag 1 47 since n value obtained is higher for the go adsorbent i e 2 08 the binding intensity also higher for go adsorbent for adsorbent and fluoride the calculated maximum adsorption capacity for rgo ce ag and ce ag is 434 78 and 294 11 mg g respectively calculated by langmuir isotherm fig 11a these results signify that rgo ce ag adsorbent exhibited higher removal capacity due to its higher surface area and active binding sites of go as compared to ce ag these results prove the significance of successful experimentation for the synthesis of ce ag incorporated in go for the fluoride removal studies the rl found 1 for both the adsorbents means favorable adsorption process temkin isotherm fig 11c also explains the heterogeneous surface of adsorbent both the model fitted good for temkin as compared to langmuir which favors homogeneous surface of adsorbent the constant b is related to the heat of adsorption during the process rgo ce ag requires 33 24 j mol while ce ag requires 24 70 j mol from the d r isotherm fig 11d the removal capacity again higher for the go incorporated adsorbent i e 281 46 mg g for rgo ce ag while 235 09 for ce ag the calculated mean free energy for rgo ce ag and ce ag was 2 6 and 4 34 kj mol which signify the physical forces involve in the adsorption process which reveals from the study of regeneration shows good regeneration ability of adsorbents may be possible as physical adsorption is prevailing phenomenon fig 12 a d shows the jovanovich redlich peterson harkins jura and hasley model the value for the redlich peterson exponent nrp obtained is ranged from 0 72 to 0 89 and deviation from the unity indicating fewer tendencies to exhibit saturation behavior as implied by the langmuir isotherm all the adsorption results are summarized in table 2 table 3 shows the comparison of adsorption capacity of present adsorbent with other go based adsorbents obtained from the published data 4 5 speciation studies the mobility of ions and its distribution in the solution can be determined by the speciation studies the speciation study was carried out in the presence of other ions at 20 mg l each with concentration of fluoride 10 mg l with a wide range of ph values the data is used for the speciation calculation and fitted to the model using visual minteq software the species of ions in a broad range of ph values 3 to 11 is plotted and shown in fig 13 very acidic ph the solution contains mostly hf which sharply decreases and almost zero around ph 5 at the ph 3 to 6 5 the fluoride is mostly present in hf2 species of about 60 as below phpzc the surface is positively charged and retains as h ion so fluoride combines due to its high affinity throughout the wide range of ph 100 h2co3 and hco3 species present and about 60 h3po4 is present from ph 7 5 to 13 the other species are present moderate to negligible in whole range of ph 4 6 effect of co ions various ions are present in the groundwater such as cl no3 so4 2 hco3 co3 2 and po4 3 co ions effect on fluoride removal by rgo ce ag and ce ag in the presence of 20 50 and 100 mg l of co ions concentration and 10 mg l of fluoride concentration fig 14 showed that co ions effect the adsorption performance of fluoride by competing with for the active sites due opposite charge of active sites and co ions fluoride adsorption is mainly affected by the po4 3 followed by so4 2 and co3 2 the relative r of fluoride in the presence of 20 50 and 100 mg l phosphate are 85 1 81 46 and 78 and 81 46 78 and 73 for rgo ce ag and ce ag respectively while in the presence of sulphate the values are 87 1 84 5 and 81 and 84 5 81 7 and 78 9 for rgo ce ag and ce ag respectively the r of fluoride was much affected in the presence of po4 3 and so4 2 indicates inner sphere complexation of active sites thus reducing the active sites for the fluoride adsorption the co3 2 increases solution s ph and reduces fluoride adsorption this fact confirmed by ph studies moreover fluoride adsorption was least effected in presence of chloride and nitrate due to outer spherically sorbing anions 4 7 regeneration for an adsorption process regeneration of adsorbent is a significant characteristics property the regeneration of adsorbent is highly dependent on density of oh group which are responsible for fluoride adsorption because active hydroxyl groups either replace by fluoride by ion exchange mechanism or active hydroxyl group adsorb fluoride ion in the present study the exhausted adsorbent was regenerated by different alkali concentration from 0 01 to 0 20 m naoh fig 15a shows the regeneration of rgo ce ag composite and seen to be regenerate effectively at 0 1 m naoh concentration which is equal to the amount of fluoride adsorbed by the adsorbent some of the substituted hydroxide groups do not have activity due to which regeneration efficiency is not 100 fig 15b shows the regeneration cycles vs percentage removal of fluoride with rgo ce ag and ce ag adsorbents as the number of cycle for regeneration increases the efficiency of both the adsorbents decreases with 5 upto 3rd cycle towards the removal of fluoride and in the fifth cycle only 75 fluoride could be removed 4 8 validation in field study the samples were collected from nearby area of north west delhi india the adsorbent dose of 0 1 g has been taken in 100 ml of water sample collected the contents were mixed at room temperature and shaken for 90 min the concentration of fluoride in the water sample was determined and found the fluoride concentration 5 01 mg l after the adsorption experiment the concentration of fluoride in sample was reduced to 0 05 mg l as the natural water sample having many cations and anions so percentage of removal is found to be 99 at 1 0 g l adsorbent dose hence the synthesized adsorbent can be used effectively work for fluoride removal from water having with concentration 5 0 mg l 4 9 mechanism on the basis of the adsorption study experiments and kinetic studies the adsorption of the fluoride over the go adsorbent was occur due to chemisorption as well as physio sorption mechanism and follows the second order rate which means the adsorption process is dependent on the fluoride as well as the active sites of the adsorbent the chemisorption mechanism is possible due to some ion pair formation or h bonding possible between the adsorbent and the fluoride ion and the physiosorption mechanism is possible due to electrostatic interaction between the positively charged active sites of the adsorbent and the negatively charged fluoride ion basically the adsorption mechanism is based on hsab mechanism the adsorption sites act as hard acid while fluoride ion is hard base 4 10 quality assurance of the results the analytical procedure opted to carry out the determination of fluoride as well as other co ions after adsorption experimentation followed a routine calibration of the instrument and corrections of blank the si traceable crms of 1000 mg kg fluoride standard multi anion standard of each 10 mg kg and the bnds are used for calibration and recovery experiment external calibration method was opted with linear regression of r2 0 99 and the removal of fluoride was tested in replicates 5 conclusion graphene oxide go incorporated cerium silver composite and cerium silver bimetallic oxide synthesized by simple chemical precipitation method and further analyzed by number of analytical tools such as fesem edx bet ftir tga and xrd to understand the surface behavior which is responsible for the good adsorption behavior both these adsorbents were show good results and follows same trends in all aspects of adsorption study only the difference in the adsorption capacities due to difference in surface area the surface area of rgo ce ag and ce ag are 375 and 174 m2 g respectively higher surface area of rgo ce ag composite might be due the graphene layers the adsorption capacity of rgo ce ag composite was also much higher than metal oxide composite due to higher surface area and higher number of active sites the percent adsorption and maximum adsorption capacity for rgo ce ag obtained was 99 5 and 434 78 mg g respectively at ph 7 0 while for ce ag it was 95 75 and 294 11 mg g respectively at ph 7 0 both of these follow freundlich adsorption isotherms which signify the multilayer type of adsorption on heterogeneous surface of adsorbent rl value shows favorable adsorption the adsorption process follows the second order kinetics i e both adsorbate and adsorbent are responsible for the adsorption process adsorption isotherm study and kinetic study favors the chemisorption mechanism with multilayer type of adsorption on heterogeneous surface co ion study reveals that the sulphate and phosphate are the interfering ions which effect the adsorption of fluoride due to inner sphere mechanism regeneration of spent adsorbent by utilizing 0 1 m naoh up to 5 cycles with up to 75 thus rgo ce ag is a more suitable adsorbent which is capable to adsorb fluoride up to 99 5 when the initial concentration of fluoride is 10 mg l 0 8 g l adsorbent dose at ph 7 suitable for de fluoridation of drinking water the following is the supplementary data related to this article fig s1 a ftir

13273,the on line monitoring of wastewater treatment plant wwtp operations is a challenge due to interference and breakdown from the harsh conditions endured by sensors in wastewater to lessen the dependence on hardware sensors mathematical models have been developed for estimating wastewater parameters these so called software soft sensors have advanced significantly from mechanistic modelling to the latest machine learning models the current review aimed to characterize these advancements in wwtp soft sensors by 1 identifying the current status of wwtp soft sensors 2 analyzing the advancements in soft sensor development methods over time and 3 evaluating wwtp soft sensors in relation to hardware technology it is difficult to define an all encompassing state of the art owing to significant variations in the physical and statistical properties of different wwtps however the study was able to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in specific contexts based on the statistical properties of the dataset used for soft sensor development it found that although neural networks have remained the dominant methodology for soft sensor development since the early 2000s some decision tree based approaches have shown promising performance and enhanced robustness it also highlights the importance of adjunct statistical methods for handling multicollinearity and noise which are common problems in wwtp datasets opportunities to use soft sensor modelling approaches to enhance hardware sensor performance have also been identified continuous improvements in the reliability and range of measurement of hardware sensors are expected to enhance the performance and scope of application of wwtp soft sensors keywords soft sensor process model machine learning wastewater treatment wastewater monitoring 1 introduction on line monitoring is an essential aspect of the digitalization of wastewater treatment plants wwtps however it has long been a challenge the measurement of most conventional wastewater monitoring parameters via laboratory tests can take several minutes or even days hardware sensors have been developed for these parameters however the readings of these sensors are skewed by interference biofilm formation and general deterioration from the harsh conditions of wastewater thus requiring regular maintenance and replacement 1 4 as an alternative software soft sensors have been developed that use mathematical modelling to translate easy to measure parameters or existing sensors into important operating parameters 2 in on line monitoring software sensors can serve as convenient economical alternative to hardware sensors and may also shorten the sensor development time for new parameters of interest such as the presence of pathogens which are not part of the conventional pool of monitoring parameters but may be particularly relevant at a specific time or in a specific situation 5 the components of a typical soft sensor are given in fig 1 the soft sensor is developed by using hardware sensor data to calibrate a mathematical model which outputs a certain target parameter this output serves as the reading of the soft sensor the accuracy and reliability of soft sensors have improved with the advancement of artificial intelligence ai methods these improvements have been analyzed in multiple reviews of ai applications on water treatment ye et al 6 discussed the different data driven models that have been applied towards soft sensor development regmi et al 7 summarized a discourse on the transition from mechanistic modelling to black box data driven models haimi et al 2 conducted an earlier review of data driven models applied to soft sensor development and also enumerated the challenges leading to deployment in real wwtps therrien et al 3 evaluated the extent of data utilization in wastewater resource recovery facilities in terms data collection modelling and storage mannina et al 8 reviewed different decision support systems including soft sensors and defined what each kind of system could contribute towards addressing wwtp management operation and design problems these reviews showed that a variety of non linear modelling methods have been employed to uncover complex relationships between wastewater parameters 2 6 7 however aside from the specific model used to map the existing sensors with the target parameter there are other statistical methods that may be employed these include parameter selection and denoising which are common preprocessing methods in most applications of data driven modelling 9 10 moreover it is important to know the characteristics of the dataset that made these methods effective it is notable that although the conventional wastewater parameters are a standard for many countries and although there is a growing body of literature on soft sensor development it has been difficult to establish a baseline for performance this is because each study in this research area uses a different and exclusive dataset 3 6 this means that the advantage of one method over another is unlikely to be because of the intrinsic superiority of that model but more likely because of its aptness for the context of application few studies have commented on the statistical attributes of the dataset that makes their proposed methods effective such attributes can include range distribution and noise level among many other attributes the nature of the wastewater may also affect the effectiveness of using specific sensors as predictors for a target variable because of differences in the correlation between wastewater parameters in different contexts such as for example the importance of total suspended solids tss in predicting biochemical oxygen demand bod for municipal wastewater when compared to industrial wastewater 11 12 the objective of this review is to make recommendations for soft sensor development based on the advancements in soft sensor modelling approaches first it comments on the current state of the art regarding wwtp soft sensors including the choice of target parameters the input sensors and overall soft sensor performance second it assesses the mathematical methods applied in soft sensor development identifying areas for further research third it evaluates the future of wwtp soft sensors in relation to the hardware sensors which can potentially be used as inputs for soft sensors or alternatives 2 current status of wwtp soft sensors 2 1 wwtp parameters monitored by soft sensors generally studies on soft sensor development have increased in recent years this can be attributed to the improved computing ability of computers as well as the popularity of data driven modelling 7 in addition the increase can also be attributed to the increasing variety of target parameters which soft sensor development is dedicated to fig 2 shows the number of publications on soft sensors for wwtps segmented according to their target parameter with regards to the oxidation process earlier studies tended to focus on chemical oxygen demand cod in fig 2a compared to biochemical oxygen demand bod in fig 2b in compiling data for soft sensor development it is likely that more data on cod was available as it has a shorter lead time for measurement 30 min compared to mostly 5 days in bod in recent time more reliable sensors for cod have emerged such as the photoelectrochemical cod sensor of liao et al 94 the nano copper cod sensor of yang et al 13 and the tio2 nano tube cod sensor of liang et al 14 it is understood that cod is one of the strongest estimators for bod hence the availability of better cod data as training samples or as inputs for bod have improved the capabilities of bod soft sensors this is observable based on the increasing number of bod soft sensors in recent years in comparison each year there is a relatively steady number of soft sensor studies on total suspended solids tss it was observed that in many cases the tss soft sensor was developed alongside other target parameters e g alongside cod in pai et al 15 alongside cod and nutrient concentrations in fernandez de canete et al 16 and bagheri et al 17 tss sensors are among the more reliable kind which may make using tss data as one of the target parameters important for validating any proposed methodology there is a continuous rise in the number of studies concerning nutrient removal in particular the various parameters involved in the nitrogen removal process have been a consistent area of interest in soft sensor development see fig 2c these parameters include total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn total nitrogen tn ammonium nh4 and nitrate no3 studies differ significantly on the input sensors used to develop these nitrogen soft sensors they are summarized in table 1 likewise with bod soft sensors advancements in hardware sensors and the quality of data collected may have played a role in the recent influx of studies alongside the rising popularity of machine learning in comparison there are fewer sensor studies on the phosphorus removal process see fig 2d the significance of phosphorus as a wastewater parameter depends on the local abundance or shortage of this nutrient despite this there have been consistent numbers of studies on total phosphorus tp and orthophosphates po4 3 see fig 2e the aforementioned parameters are among the most common measures for wastewater quality other measures related to wastewater treatment include the oxygen uptake rate for oxidation processes 35 ph 25 36 37 turbidity 38 grease concentration 39 organic nitrogen 91 dye concentration 50 total dissolved solids 40 89 odor 41 and e coli concentration 5 among other studies summarized in fig 2f some of these measures such as ph and turbidity can already be reliably monitored using hardware sensors in other cases the parameters are important for a specific context such as dye concentration and grease concentration for certain industries and the presence of e coli in areas with high potential for disease there is great potential for cross learning between different target parameters in soft sensor development with many possible directions for future studies 2 2 inputs in wwtp soft sensor development input sensors are a vital component of the soft sensor the type of parameter measured by the input sensor is important as ideally these inputs would share the highest correlation or covariance with the target parameter however this is seldom the case in wastewater treatment where the parameters tend to share nonlinear and complex chemical relationships table 1 evaluates the use of input sensors in soft sensor development as hardware sensors have advanced in durability accuracy and cost efficiency the input sensors used in soft sensor development have increased in variety earlier studies tended to use tss 18 26 aeration rate 23 27 and flowrate 25 among other parameters that can be measured online using commercially available sensors recent studies such as the bod soft sensor of xiao et al 22 and the tn soft sensor of fernandez de canete et al 34 still make use of these sensors these studies use a larger number of input sensors including some sensors for nutrient concentration e g nh4 no3 in most cases the influent quality parameters were used as input parameters for effluent quality conversely effluent quality cannot be used to estimate influent quality in on line monitoring as the influent precedes the effluent this may partially account for the relatively large number of soft sensor studies where the target parameters are effluent parameters in addition effluent quality may be easier to predict as its values are controlled by the process in comparison the effluent is affected by various external factors e g human activities weather which are harder to predict among the available studies on soft sensors for the influent are soft sensors for influent total phosphorus by zhu et al 10 influent cod by wang et al 42 influent bod cod and tn by hernández del olmo et al 43 influent cod and nh4 n by kern et al 44 and influent bod by gawdzik et al 45 there are also fewer studies on soft sensors that take measures during special treatment processes such as the soft sensors inside the bioreactor by nilsson et al 46 and measurements taken inside of filter units by mulas et al 47 2 3 benchmarking of wwtp soft sensors although many wwtp soft sensors have been developed for various target parameters it is difficult to compare performance because each of these soft sensors was developed in a specific context table 2 presents the performance of wwtp soft sensors organized according to the properties of the dataset used in soft sensor development the source of the wastewater is one differentiating factor industrial wastewater and municipal wastewater have different components which affects the effectiveness of common input sensors and modelling approaches statistical properties such as the variance and distribution of parameters may also affect performance of soft sensors either through the training process or in performance when applied in monitoring the following observations were made on the performance of soft sensors first larger training sets do not necessarily mean better performance in the common metrics i e higher r2 lower root mean square error rmse in soft sensor development for bod5 the model based on a dataset of 400 samples by liu et al 48 reflected a higher r2 compared to the model based on 9180 samples by ebrahimi et al 20 likewise in soft sensor development for cod the model based on 134 samples by nadiri et al 21 has a higher r2 relative to the model based on 192 samples by perendeci et al 27 generally using a larger training set should improve model performance the fact that this was not the case suggests that there are major differences between the training sets used by the individual studies poor performance can be attributed to measurement noise higher variance within the dataset and or the lack of apt predictors second it can be observed for models that were evaluated using more than one performance measure that better performance in one metric may not necessarily mean better performance in a second metric in soft sensor development for cod the model of nadiri et al 21 had a higher r2 compared to fernandez de canete et al 16 with r2 being a measure of accuracy this should imply that the model of nadiri et al 21 would also have a lower mean average percent error mape however its mape value shows otherwise this could be because the model of nadiri et al 21 has a wider range or higher variance it supports the idea that differences in performance may be attributed to differences in the dataset used and are not necessarily because one method is superior to another this has implications for the deployment of soft sensors on real wwtps the methodology to be used in soft sensor development should be adapted from studies that used reasonably similar datasets and from similar sources as the intended context of application moreover it is unlikely that the performance of the model documented in literature will be equal to the performance in real wwtps good performance can be achieved by identifying the models that are most appropriate for specific dataset characteristics and having standard tests to determine the dataset characteristics 3 advancements related to soft sensor modelling methods in analyzing soft sensor development methods there is a strong value in the choice of model past reviews have documented the transition from mechanistic models e g the activated sludge model to data driven black box models 7 other reviews focusing on data driven models have made comparisons between them identifying their advantages and disadvantages 2 6 8 these reviews concluded that artificial neural networks anns have been the most widely used models for soft sensor development the current review conducted an analysis of the yearly publications using various models for soft sensor development see fig 3a and concluded that based on the increasing number of applications of this method it seems that ann will remain the dominant approach in the coming years the primary advantage of ann is its ability to model nonlinear relationships these relationships are modelled through a series of hidden layers and neurons linking the input and output variables each hidden layer is composed of multiple neurons with each neuron acting as a function that transforms the values of the input variables these functions can be simple linear functions activation functions that will improve the calibration of model coefficients e g rectified linear unit relu or even special activation functions selected in relation to the characteristics of the data in particular many studies have applied the radial basis function as an activation function to lower the data requirement for training ann the wavelet transform has also been applied to de noise the input data 28 these can result in highly sophisticated architectures which come at the expense of interpretability there is a wide variety of potential architectures which can be partially addressed through optimization algorithms such as the genetic algorithm 49 and the group search algorithm 37 in addition the calibration of model coefficients may have a tendency to converge to local minima requiring modifications in the optimization process recently there has also been an emergence of decision tree based methods e g gradient boosted trees in gawdzik et al 45 random forest regression in hernández del olmo et al 43 regression trees in razvarz and jafari 50 compared to other non linear modelling approaches the estimation process of decision trees is easy to interpret these models make an estimate through simple splits based on the values of the input variables deeper trees can make more splits in the dataset thereby creating more complex and nonlinear models yet these highly complex models may also tend to overfit to certain samples in datasets studies that used independent trees in modelling have noted that this is a non robust learning model the structure of the tree can change significantly based on small changes in the training data this was addressed by ensemble learning random forest rf regression uses a group of simple decision trees and averages the results to make a more robust estimate 43 extreme gradient boosting incrementally collates a group of regression trees each of which may capture characteristics of the distribution making this model suitable for non normal data distributions 51 multivariate linear regression mlr is also used in a significant portion of wwtp soft sensors see fig 3b this model is also easy to interpret as the magnitude of the model coefficients may serve as indicators on the importance of a variable however recent applications of mlr in literature are sometimes made in the context of comparing mlr with nonlinear modelling approaches e g comparisons with the mechanistic models regression tree ensembles and ann by dunnington et al 52 comparison with ann svm and rf by pattanayak et al 53 the disadvantage with using mlr is that wwtp parameters tend to share highly nonlinear and dynamic relationships this has been addressed with localized mlr models where the input data is clustered and an exclusive mlr model is developed for each cluster 54 the multivariate adaptive regression splines model an ensemble of hinge functions has a similar intuition because the hinge functions follow a linear format 42 45 a hybrid model known as the m5 model fuses the decision tree and mlr methodology with the splits of the decision tree culminating in an mlr node 55 through such methods mlr has been adapted for nonlinear modelling the dynamic nature of wastewater treatment has been addressed using autoregressive models this family of models uses the past data on the target parameter and other related parameters to predict future values this modelling framework is helpful in cases where there are significant trends in the data that can improve the quality of predictions the autoregressive integrated moving average arima model is a popular model for such cases 38 56 in the case of arima the future values of the target parameter are linearly regressed from past values a nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous inputs narx has been developed for effluent bod with improved results ling sun 2020 other versions of nonlinear time series modelling include the use of recurrent neural networks rnns by chang and li 57 and the long short term memory model by pisa et al 58 there are now relatively few studies that use mechanistic modelling for soft sensor development the activated sludge model asm is the most popular wastewater treatment model however these have limited use in online monitoring given that 1 they can only estimate effluent parameters 2 they depend on influent parameters that the wwtp may not necessarily have the monitoring infrastructure for and 3 it is difficult to recalibrate the model to incorporate new factors or dynamic changes however these models still serve a purpose as demonstrated in some recent monitoring studies where they are used to generate a dataset to simulate the performance of the soft sensor data simulated from asm1 has been used to validate the narx model developed by ling and sun 92 data from the benchmark simulation model has been used in training a gaussian process regression gpr model by liu et al 59 an rvm model by liu et al 48 and a co trained gpr svm model by li et al 60 generally all of these models except mlr and partial least squares regression pls take nonlinear modelling approaches suitable for the mostly nonlinear relationships between different wwtp parameters in the studies reviewed neural networks kernel machines and decision tree based methods were all applied because of their ability to model nonlinear relationships however there are still key differences between the methods that may make one preferable to another for specific datasets table 3 presents a roadmap for model selection based on key characteristics of datasets where each method may have an advantage or disadvantage one factor that needs to be considered in selecting a nonlinear model is the availability of data to represent the distribution of the target parameter this is associated with the size of the dataset although larger datasets do not necessarily correspond to better model performance depending on the data distribution the actual data requirement may vary neural networks and decision trees may overfit the available training data potentially resulting in poor performance on other inputs from the same population 17 kernel machines e g support vector machines and relevant vector machines have some advantage in this case as these methods maximize generalizability another factor that needs to be considered is measurement noise coming from sensor interference or even human errors in laboratory measurement the ability of neural networks to model very specific nonlinear relationships may also lead to fitting over noise in the data distribution resulting in inaccurate estimations in this case kernel machines may likewise be applied because of their advantage in generalizability modifying the neural network to enhance generalizability e g through radial basis functions such as in zhu et al 10 and bagheri et al 17 is another option a third consideration is that the dataset may also contain sparsely occurring values of interest these include very high levels of pollutants that an online monitoring system needs to detect and measure accurately to effectively support wwtp operations the sparse presence of cases of extreme high pollutant measures in the datasets results in a skewed data distribution for most wwtp parameters the distribution of effluent parameters is particularly skewed there are fewer instances of high pollutant concentrations as the wwtp has the objective of controlling the levels of these pollutants within a maximum acceptable threshold models with a generalizability objective would tend to nullify these sparsely occurring values as outliers or abnormalities in this context decision tree based ensembles are recommended as each member of the decision tree can represent a part of the distribution aside from nonlinearity the wwtp parameters may also be characterized by dynamic behaviors these may result from seasonal changes such as higher oxidation rates owing to higher temperatures in some months of the year 61 increased human activity during waking hours e g 08 00 to 22 00 also results in more water consumption and thus rising pollutant concentrations in wastewater during those hours 44 62 the presence of such patterns in the input data would depend on the sampling frequency for the input parameters the aforementioned trends would be effective for relatively long intervals i e days to weeks in order to capture seasonal temperature changes or hours to capture the changes related to human activity while this framework may still be applied in online monitoring it requires the storage of past data which would need to be considered in designing the infrastructure for data collection on the wwtp the selection of an appropriate machine learning model is undoubtedly an important aspect of soft sensor development however there are other stages of development that contribute to performance see table 4 given the large variety of potential inputs i e various wwtp parameters sampled at different stages of treatment from crude sewage to primary treatment to bioreactors until the final effluent is discharged into receiving water body many studies apply a method to select the input variables this can benefit soft sensor performance by only including the parameters with the strongest relationship to the target parameter as inputs reducing the model inputs can also improve the reliability of the soft sensor as using more input sensors increase the chance of failure from sensor breakdowns assuming the soft sensor model requires a dense input vector however for model accuracy the primary benefit of reducing the input variables is to reduce multicollinearity multicollinearity means that each input variable can be linearly regressed from the other input variables this implies that there are interactions between the input variables in such cases each input variable appears to account for more of the variance in the target parameter resulting in very large model coefficients when the model has been calibrated using mathematical optimization this makes the model very sensitive to changes in the input variables which can lead to poor estimations when inputs that were not part of the training set are used i e overfitting multicollinearity can be expected from related parameters in some cases studies measure an input parameter at different points in treatment one example is measuring do in both the anaerobic tank and the oxic tank to estimate the value of an effluent parameter for modelling effluent tp zhu et al 10 omitted the use of do in the anaerobic tank as an input another potential relationship is between bod and organic nitrogen in tn or bod and the organic components of tss ebrahimi et al 20 avoided overfitting from using these parameters as inputs by using interaction terms derived from a principal component analysis pca inputs in a time series may also be liable to result in multicollinearity measures of the same parameter taken from the influent and the effluent respectively may share some correlation if the treatment process is stable enough aside from using influent and effluent parameters as input sensors fernandez de canete et al 16 used parameters sampled at different intervals as online monitoring systems become more common the availability of continuous data yields many collinear potential inputs for soft sensor modelling alternatively with methods such as pca and pls this can be an opportunity to identify the best intervals for sampling input parameters in relation qin et al 39 used uv vis spectra as input sensors for estimating wastewater quality as the apparatus could measure this from a variety of wavelengths the authors were able to use a modified pls model to select the inputs for the soft sensor redundant input variables can be removed based on their pls regression coefficient pls raises the model coefficients of inputs that share the highest covariance with the target parameter 66 in this way the least redundant input variables will have the highest regression coefficient alternatively pca derives the principal components independent linear transformations of the input variables these components do not interact and using them as inputs for the model can help avoid overfitting 12 ling sun 2020 applications of pls and pca on cases with a high potential for multicollinearity are given in table 5 it is notable that not all studies applied methods to address the multicollinearity between input sensors despite this some soft sensors without these methods had relatively good accuracy based on r2 and rmse measures still studies which were able to make the comparison between applying pca pls and the related methods noted that there was an improvement over model development with the collinear inputs liu et al 66 recorded an improvement in r2 in applying kernel pls to select inputs zhu et al 10 noted that there was a reduction in rmse from their soft sensor in the context of data abundance the potential of multicollinearity cannot be ignored and must be considered in soft sensor development in real wastewater treatment the target parameter may be affected by factors not recorded in the dataset clustering can help take these factors into consideration by dividing the dataset into sub populations based on the available input parameters k means clustering applied by grieu et al 23 arranges the data into k clusters such that each sample is assigned based on the mean of the cluster it is closest to under k means clustering the number of clusters are arbitrarily specified a density based clustering algorithm is based on the idea that cluster centers are denser and thus can be used as a way to identify the clusters this form of clustering was applied by li and zhang 67 specifically on the weather conditions during wastewater treatment noting that this will result in different forms of nonlinearity in influent behaviour likewise heo et al 68 segmented the dataset by applying fuzzy c means clustering on the influent parameters this differs from k means clustering in the sense that each sample can be a member of multiple clusters in varying degrees based on a probability value because of sensor interference measurement noise and other random noise the values of the input data may include some inaccuracies as this may skew the estimations of the soft sensor the noisy data needs to be corrected wavelet transforms can extract the true value of wastewater parameter based on the frequency of the values 9 exponential smoothing may reduce random noise in time series with short intervals by updating the value of the parameter relative to its previous values 18 machine learning models such as auto encoders seek to recreate the original data thereby creating an understanding of the underlying distribution and consequently obtaining the true value of the parameter 33 we note that as most studies use historical data over the course of several months in modelling e g the dataset of pai et al 15 runs from january 3 to september 30 it may not be possible to know the true noise free value of the data even laboratory measurements may be subject to some degree of noise making it hard to validate the denoising methods yet these denoising methods may still amplify features in the input data which can potentially improve soft sensor accuracy neural networks in particular include a variety of hyperparameters these consist of the number of hidden layers in the model the number of hidden neurons in the model and even the activation function applied at each neuron the genetic algorithm is an efficient search algorithm which can be applied to identify the combination of hyperparameters that will result in the best model performance it is based on the process of natural selection which uses both random mutation and selection based on good outcomes as a means of optimization 49 however it can also be a lengthy process requiring the development of multiple models alternatives such as the self organizing neural network of li et al 69 algorithmically defines its own architecture as the model coefficients are calibrated which may lead to faster convergence 4 future developments in relation to hardware sensor technology the reliability and accuracy of any soft sensor is dependent on the quality of its input sensors with the advent of electrochemical sensors it has become possible to have accurate low cost and relatively durable hardware sensors these sensors work by equating a wastewater parameter to the amount of electric current produced from an electrochemical reaction the potential of microorganisms in generating these electrochemical reactions has been considered 70 immobilized microorganisms from the activated sludge used in wastewater treatment can be used 71 specific cultures have also been considered in biosensor development such as bacillus subtilis 72 trichosporon cutaneum 73 and aeromonas hydrophila 74 these cultures were selected based on qualities such as linear range response time and stability the linear range of a sensor refers to the range of readings that share a linear relationship with the signal measured by the sensor this measure is important as a wider range of measurement for the input sensors would also expand the range of the soft sensor for which these inputs are the basis there have been notable improvements in the range of bod sensors e g the amperometric sensor of velling and tenno 71 had a range of 15 to 50 mg l while the microbial fuel cell based sensors of modin and wilén 70 had a range of 32 to 1280 mg l in cod measurement there has been an expansion in range from 4 8 to 600 mg l 13 to 1 44 to 672 mg l 75 nitrate and nitrite sensors also have a significantly wider range from 0 28 to 28 mg l 76 to 0 084 to 1120 mg l 93 apart from the width of the linear range for measurement these sensors have also improved in sensitivity for lower levels of pollutants the no3 sensor of bagheri et al 17 can detect levels as low as 0 0028 mg l the cod sensor of kangkun and ponchio 90 has a lower limit of 0 mg l this can allow for more precise measurements for cases where the standards for wastewater quality are very stringent response time is also an important aspect of online measurement referring to the lead time needed for the input sensors to take measurements the total lead time of the soft sensor is based on the response time of the input sensors as well as the computing time for the model making response time doubly important in the feasibility of soft sensors for bod measurement shorter response times can be observed in the sensors developed by velling and tenno 71 at 12 to 15 min and the sensor of raud et al 74 at 10 to 20 min the flow based sensor of modin and wilén 70 has a longer lead time of 5 to 12 h but this also significantly extends the linear range of the soft sensor although these lead times are still inconvenient in the context of real time monitoring they nonetheless shorten the typical bod measurement process i e 5 days cod measurements have been shortened from the typical 30 min to 180 480 s based on the nano copper sensor developed by yang et al 13 nitrite can be measured as quickly as 20 s 76 the bioelectrochemical sensor requires recalibration throughout its lifespan which culminates as the microorganism culture used to stimulate the reaction fully degrades stress tests have revealed that most recent sensors can last at least 30 days these sensors include the no3 sensor of aravamudhan and bhansali 76 the cod sensor of si et al 75 and the cod sensor of liang et al 14 input sensors with longer lifespans are desirable as these result in better stability for the soft sensor the bod sensor of raud et al 74 has a relatively long lifespan of 110 to 115 days even some of the more recent sensors have shorter lifespans e g 9 days for the no3 sensor of fan et al 77 and 10 18 days for the no3 sensor of xiao et al 78 alternatively if soft sensors are being used to support hardware sensors in a monitoring system knowledge of the lifespans of specific hardware sensors can be used to identify when it is necessary to recalibrate the hardware sensors and switch to soft sensors electrochemical sensors for wastewater have also been extended to new pollutants of concern aside from the standard wwtp monitoring parameters the presence of heavy metals in wastewater is a problem in some industrial settings using gold silver oxides a cr iii vi sensor with a wide range of detection was developed 79 a modified carbon electrode sensor was developed for as iii which demonstrated robust performance against interference from other metal ions 80 the fe iii sensor of badakhshan et al 81 had a fast response time of 12 s and was stable for up to 60 days of operation aside from metals kojic acid is another parameter of interest for which a robust sensor has been developed 82 sensor interference is another common problem while some recent hardware sensors have been enhanced to improve their robustness against interference from various compounds this problem can also be addressed with data driven modelling a data driven error compensation algorithm has been developed to address ph interference in the operation of a pb ii ion selective membrane sensor 1 this addresses one of the key advantages of the membrane sensor which is otherwise inexpensive and highly durable alternatively another error compensation algorithm has been developed to address k interference for a nh4 sensor 4 in both cases the error compensation extends the useful lifetime of the sensor without needing recalibration or maintenance arguably the advancements in hardware sensor technology may eventually render soft sensors redundant however it is worth noting that the hardware sensors tend to have a limited linear range whereas soft sensors are typically developed with nonlinear modelling approaches when there is a need to develop sensors for novel parameters of interest e g e coli concentration in foschi et al 5 the development of soft sensors has a shorter lead time if the data is available finally the error compensation algorithms applied by fan et al 1 and wang et al 4 and switching algorithms between hardware and soft sensors 65 have illustrated that hardware and soft sensors can be used together to improve the overall scope and accuracy of wwtp monitoring systems 5 conclusions this literature review covered 102 studies on soft sensor development for wastewater treatment it sought to identify the relevant changes in soft sensor development over time and the implications of these changes for future studies specifically the following conclusions were reached 1 the development and application of wwtp soft sensors have increased significantly over the years particularly because of the variety in target parameters for soft sensor development 2 although many wwtp soft sensors have been developed an overall state of the art cannot be identified because of the differences in the context of development and application 3 neural networks are still the most popular modelling approach however new families of machine learning models have emerged in recent years with better generalizability for various data distributions e g kernel methods for limited or noisy data decision tree based methods for skewed distribution 4 adjunct methods for soft sensor modelling i e statistical methods for selecting input sensors denoising are worth exploring as these methods directly address problematic characteristics of the dataset as opposed to making the soft sensor more robust against them 5 the hardware of input sensors has also advanced significantly in terms of accuracy and durability but further improvements in response time may be necessary for real time monitoring and control declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this review paper 
13273,the on line monitoring of wastewater treatment plant wwtp operations is a challenge due to interference and breakdown from the harsh conditions endured by sensors in wastewater to lessen the dependence on hardware sensors mathematical models have been developed for estimating wastewater parameters these so called software soft sensors have advanced significantly from mechanistic modelling to the latest machine learning models the current review aimed to characterize these advancements in wwtp soft sensors by 1 identifying the current status of wwtp soft sensors 2 analyzing the advancements in soft sensor development methods over time and 3 evaluating wwtp soft sensors in relation to hardware technology it is difficult to define an all encompassing state of the art owing to significant variations in the physical and statistical properties of different wwtps however the study was able to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in specific contexts based on the statistical properties of the dataset used for soft sensor development it found that although neural networks have remained the dominant methodology for soft sensor development since the early 2000s some decision tree based approaches have shown promising performance and enhanced robustness it also highlights the importance of adjunct statistical methods for handling multicollinearity and noise

mechanistic modelling to black box data driven models haimi et al 2 conducted an earlier review of data driven models applied to soft sensor development and also enumerated the challenges leading to deployment in real wwtps therrien et al 3 evaluated the extent of data utilization in wastewater resource recovery facilities in terms data collection modelling and storage mannina et al 8 reviewed different decision support systems including soft sensors and defined what each kind of system could contribute towards addressing wwtp management operation and design problems these reviews showed that a variety of non linear modelling methods have been employed to uncover complex relationships between wastewater parameters 2 6 7 however aside from the specific model used to map the existing sensors with the target parameter there are other statistical methods that may be employed these include parameter selection and denoising which are common preprocessing methods in most applications of data driven modelling 9 10 moreover it is important to know the characteristics of the dataset that made these methods effective it is notable that although the conventional wastewater parameters are a standard for many countries and although there is a growing body of literature on soft sensor development it has been difficult to establish a baseline for performance this is because each study in this research area uses a different and exclusive dataset 3 6 this means that the advantage of one method over another is unlikely to be because of the intrinsic superiority of that model but more likely because of its aptness for the context of application few studies have commented on the statistical attributes of the dataset that makes their proposed methods effective such attributes can include range distribution and noise level among many other attributes the nature of the wastewater may also affect the effectiveness of using specific sensors as predictors for a target variable because of differences in the correlation between wastewater parameters in different contexts such as for example the importance of total suspended solids tss in predicting biochemical oxygen demand bod for municipal wastewater when compared to industrial wastewater 11 12 the objective of this review is to make recommendations for soft sensor development based on the advancements in soft sensor modelling approaches first it comments on the current state of the art regarding wwtp soft sensors including the choice of target parameters the input sensors and overall soft sensor performance second it assesses the mathematical methods applied in soft sensor development identifying areas for further research third it evaluates the future of wwtp soft sensors in relation to the hardware sensors which can potentially be used as inputs for soft sensors or alternatives 2 current status of wwtp soft sensors 2 1 wwtp parameters monitored by soft sensors generally studies on soft sensor development have increased in recent years this can be attributed to the improved computing ability of computers as well as the popularity of data driven modelling 7 in addition the increase can also be attributed to the increasing variety of target parameters which soft sensor development is dedicated to fig 2 shows the number of publications on soft sensors for wwtps segmented according to their target parameter with regards to the oxidation process earlier studies tended to focus on chemical oxygen demand cod in fig 2a compared to biochemical oxygen demand bod in fig 2b in compiling data for soft sensor development it is likely that more data on cod was available as it has a shorter lead time for measurement 30 min compared to mostly 5 days in bod in recent time more reliable sensors for cod have emerged such as the photoelectrochemical cod sensor of liao et al 94 the nano copper cod sensor of yang et al 13 and the tio2 nano tube cod sensor of liang et al 14 it is understood that cod is one of the strongest estimators for bod hence the availability of better cod data as training samples or as inputs for bod have improved the capabilities of bod soft sensors this is observable based on the increasing number of bod soft sensors in recent years in comparison each year there is a relatively steady number of soft sensor studies on total suspended solids tss it was observed that in many cases the tss soft sensor was developed alongside other target parameters e g alongside cod in pai et al 15 alongside cod and nutrient concentrations in fernandez de canete et al 16 and bagheri et al 17 tss sensors are among the more reliable kind which may make using tss data as one of the target parameters important for validating any proposed methodology there is a continuous rise in the number of studies concerning nutrient removal in particular the various parameters involved in the nitrogen removal process have been a consistent area of interest in soft sensor development see fig 2c these parameters include total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn total nitrogen tn ammonium nh4 and nitrate no3 studies differ significantly on the input sensors used to develop these nitrogen soft sensors they are summarized in table 1 likewise with bod soft sensors advancements in hardware sensors and the quality of data collected may have played a role in the recent influx of studies alongside the rising popularity of machine learning in comparison there are fewer sensor studies on the phosphorus removal process see fig 2d the significance of phosphorus as a wastewater parameter depends on the local abundance or shortage of this nutrient despite this there have been consistent numbers of studies on total phosphorus tp and orthophosphates po4 3 see fig 2e the aforementioned parameters are among the most common measures for wastewater quality other measures related to wastewater treatment include the oxygen uptake rate for oxidation processes 35 ph 25 36 37 turbidity 38 grease concentration 39 organic nitrogen 91 dye concentration 50 total dissolved solids 40 89 odor 41 and e coli concentration 5 among other studies summarized in fig 2f some of these measures such as ph and turbidity can already be reliably monitored using hardware sensors in other cases the parameters are important for a specific context such as dye concentration and grease concentration for certain industries and the presence of e coli in areas with high potential for disease there is great potential for cross learning between different target parameters in soft sensor development with many possible directions for future studies 2 2 inputs in wwtp soft sensor development input sensors are a vital component of the soft sensor the type of parameter measured by the input sensor is important as ideally these inputs would share the highest correlation or covariance with the target parameter however this is seldom the case in wastewater treatment where the parameters tend to share nonlinear and complex chemical relationships table 1 evaluates the use of input sensors in soft sensor development as hardware sensors have advanced in durability accuracy and cost efficiency the input sensors used in soft sensor development have increased in variety earlier studies tended to use tss 18 26 aeration rate 23 27 and flowrate 25 among other parameters that can be measured online using commercially available sensors recent studies such as the bod soft sensor of xiao et al 22 and the tn soft sensor of fernandez de canete et al 34 still make use of these sensors these studies use a larger number of input sensors including some sensors for nutrient concentration e g nh4 no3 in most cases the influent quality parameters were used as input parameters for effluent quality conversely effluent quality cannot be used to estimate influent quality in on line monitoring as the influent precedes the effluent this may partially account for the relatively large number of soft sensor studies where the target parameters are effluent parameters in addition effluent quality may be easier to predict as its values are controlled by the process in comparison the effluent is affected by various external factors e g human activities weather which are harder to predict among the available studies on soft sensors for the influent are soft sensors for influent total phosphorus by zhu et al 10 influent cod by wang et al 42 influent bod cod and tn by hernández del olmo et al 43 influent cod and nh4 n by kern et al 44 and influent bod by gawdzik et al 45 there are also fewer studies on soft sensors that take measures during special treatment processes such as the soft sensors inside the bioreactor by nilsson et al 46 and measurements taken inside of filter units by mulas et al 47 2 3 benchmarking of wwtp soft sensors although many wwtp soft sensors have been developed for various target parameters it is difficult to compare performance because each of these soft sensors was developed in a specific context table 2 presents the performance of wwtp soft sensors organized according to the properties of the dataset used in soft sensor development the source of the wastewater is one differentiating factor industrial wastewater and municipal wastewater have different components which affects the effectiveness of common input sensors and modelling approaches statistical properties such as the variance and distribution of parameters may also affect performance of soft sensors either through the training process or in performance when applied in monitoring the following observations were made on the performance of soft sensors first larger training sets do not necessarily mean better performance in the common metrics i e higher r2 lower root mean square error rmse in soft sensor development for bod5 the model based on a dataset of 400 samples by liu et al 48 reflected a higher r2 compared to the model based on 9180 samples by ebrahimi et al 20 likewise in soft sensor development for cod the model based on 134 samples by nadiri et al 21 has a higher r2 relative to the model based on 192 samples by perendeci et al 27 generally using a larger training set should improve model performance the fact that this was not the case suggests that there are major differences between the training sets used by the individual studies poor performance can be attributed to measurement noise higher variance within the dataset and or the lack of apt predictors second it can be observed for models that were evaluated using more than one performance measure that better performance in one metric may not necessarily mean better performance in a second metric in soft sensor development for cod the model of nadiri et al 21 had a higher r2 compared to fernandez de canete et al 16 with r2 being a measure of accuracy this should imply that the model of nadiri et al 21 would also have a lower mean average percent error mape however its mape value shows otherwise this could be because the model of nadiri et al 21 has a wider range or higher variance it supports the idea that differences in performance may be attributed to differences in the dataset used and are not necessarily because one method is superior to another this has implications for the deployment of soft sensors on real wwtps the methodology to be used in soft sensor development should be adapted from studies that used reasonably similar datasets and from similar sources as the intended context of application moreover it is unlikely that the performance of the model documented in literature will be equal to the performance in real wwtps good performance can be achieved by identifying the models that are most appropriate for specific dataset characteristics and having standard tests to determine the dataset characteristics 3 advancements related to soft sensor modelling methods in analyzing soft sensor development methods there is a strong value in the choice of model past reviews have documented the transition from mechanistic models e g the activated sludge model to data driven black box models 7 other reviews focusing on data driven models have made comparisons between them identifying their advantages and disadvantages 2 6 8 these reviews concluded that artificial neural networks anns have been the most widely used models for soft sensor development the current review conducted an analysis of the yearly publications using various models for soft sensor development see fig 3a and concluded that based on the increasing number of applications of this method it seems that ann will remain the dominant approach in the coming years the primary advantage of ann is its ability to model nonlinear relationships these relationships are modelled through a series of hidden layers and neurons linking the input and output variables each hidden layer is composed of multiple neurons with each neuron acting as a function that transforms the values of the input variables these functions can be simple linear functions activation functions that will improve the calibration of model coefficients e g rectified linear unit relu or even special activation functions selected in relation to the characteristics of the data in particular many studies have applied the radial basis function as an activation function to lower the data requirement for training ann the wavelet transform has also been applied to de noise the input data 28 these can result in highly sophisticated architectures which come at the expense of interpretability there is a wide variety of potential architectures which can be partially addressed through optimization algorithms such as the genetic algorithm 49 and the group search algorithm 37 in addition the calibration of model coefficients may have a tendency to converge to local minima requiring modifications in the optimization process recently there has also been an emergence of decision tree based methods e g gradient boosted trees in gawdzik et al 45 random forest regression in hernández del olmo et al 43 regression trees in razvarz and jafari 50 compared to other non linear modelling approaches the estimation process of decision trees is easy to interpret these models make an estimate through simple splits based on the values of the input variables deeper trees can make more splits in the dataset thereby creating more complex and nonlinear models yet these highly complex models may also tend to overfit to certain samples in datasets studies that used independent trees in modelling have noted that this is a non robust learning model the structure of the tree can change significantly based on small changes in the training data this was addressed by ensemble learning random forest rf regression uses a group of simple decision trees and averages the results to make a more robust estimate 43 extreme gradient boosting incrementally collates a group of regression trees each of which may capture characteristics of the distribution making this model suitable for non normal data distributions 51 multivariate linear regression mlr is also used in a significant portion of wwtp soft sensors see fig 3b this model is also easy to interpret as the magnitude of the model coefficients may serve as indicators on the importance of a variable however recent applications of mlr in literature are sometimes made in the context of comparing mlr with nonlinear modelling approaches e g comparisons with the mechanistic models regression tree ensembles and ann by dunnington et al 52 comparison with ann svm and rf by pattanayak et al 53 the disadvantage with using mlr is that wwtp parameters tend to share highly nonlinear and dynamic relationships this has been addressed with localized mlr models where the input data is clustered and an exclusive mlr model is developed for each cluster 54 the multivariate adaptive regression splines model an ensemble of hinge functions has a similar intuition because the hinge functions follow a linear format 42 45 a hybrid model known as the m5 model fuses the decision tree and mlr methodology with the splits of the decision tree culminating in an mlr node 55 through such methods mlr has been adapted for nonlinear modelling the dynamic nature of wastewater treatment has been addressed using autoregressive models this family of models uses the past data on the target parameter and other related parameters to predict future values this modelling framework is helpful in cases where there are significant trends in the data that can improve the quality of predictions the autoregressive integrated moving average arima model is a popular model for such cases 38 56 in the case of arima the future values of the target parameter are linearly regressed from past values a nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous inputs narx has been developed for effluent bod with improved results ling sun 2020 other versions of nonlinear time series modelling include the use of recurrent neural networks rnns by chang and li 57 and the long short term memory model by pisa et al 58 there are now relatively few studies that use mechanistic modelling for soft sensor development the activated sludge model asm is the most popular wastewater treatment model however these have limited use in online monitoring given that 1 they can only estimate effluent parameters 2 they depend on influent parameters that the wwtp may not necessarily have the monitoring infrastructure for and 3 it is difficult to recalibrate the model to incorporate new factors or dynamic changes however these models still serve a purpose as demonstrated in some recent monitoring studies where they are used to generate a dataset to simulate the performance of the soft sensor data simulated from asm1 has been used to validate the narx model developed by ling and sun 92 data from the benchmark simulation model has been used in training a gaussian process regression gpr model by liu et al 59 an rvm model by liu et al 48 and a co trained gpr svm model by li et al 60 generally all of these models except mlr and partial least squares regression pls take nonlinear modelling approaches suitable for the mostly nonlinear relationships between different wwtp parameters in the studies reviewed neural networks kernel machines and decision tree based methods were all applied because of their ability to model nonlinear relationships however there are still key differences between the methods that may make one preferable to another for specific datasets table 3 presents a roadmap for model selection based on key characteristics of datasets where each method may have an advantage or disadvantage one factor that needs to be considered in selecting a nonlinear model is the availability of data to represent the distribution of the target parameter this is associated with the size of the dataset although larger datasets do not necessarily correspond to better model performance depending on the data distribution the actual data requirement may vary neural networks and decision trees may overfit the available training data potentially resulting in poor performance on other inputs from the same population 17 kernel machines e g support vector machines and relevant vector machines have some advantage in this case as these methods maximize generalizability another factor that needs to be considered is measurement noise coming from sensor interference or even human errors in laboratory measurement the ability of neural networks to model very specific nonlinear relationships may also lead to fitting over noise in the data distribution resulting in inaccurate estimations in this case kernel machines may likewise be applied because of their advantage in generalizability modifying the neural network to enhance generalizability e g through radial basis functions such as in zhu et al 10 and bagheri et al 17 is another option a third consideration is that the dataset may also contain sparsely occurring values of interest these include very high levels of pollutants that an online monitoring system needs to detect and measure accurately to effectively support wwtp operations the sparse presence of cases of extreme high pollutant measures in the datasets results in a skewed data distribution for most wwtp parameters the distribution of effluent parameters is particularly skewed there are fewer instances of high pollutant concentrations as the wwtp has the objective of controlling the levels of these pollutants within a maximum acceptable threshold models with a generalizability objective would tend to nullify these sparsely occurring values as outliers or abnormalities in this context decision tree based ensembles are recommended as each member of the decision tree can represent a part of the distribution aside from nonlinearity the wwtp parameters may also be characterized by dynamic behaviors these may result from seasonal changes such as higher oxidation rates owing to higher temperatures in some months of the year 61 increased human activity during waking hours e g 08 00 to 22 00 also results in more water consumption and thus rising pollutant concentrations in wastewater during those hours 44 62 the presence of such patterns in the input data would depend on the sampling frequency for the input parameters the aforementioned trends would be effective for relatively long intervals i e days to weeks in order to capture seasonal temperature changes or hours to capture the changes related to human activity while this framework may still be applied in online monitoring it requires the storage of past data which would need to be considered in designing the infrastructure for data collection on the wwtp the selection of an appropriate machine learning model is undoubtedly an important aspect of soft sensor development however there are other stages of development that contribute to performance see table 4 given the large variety of potential inputs i e various wwtp parameters sampled at different stages of treatment from crude sewage to primary treatment to bioreactors until the final effluent is discharged into receiving water body many studies apply a method to select the input variables this can benefit soft sensor performance by only including the parameters with the strongest relationship to the target parameter as inputs reducing the model inputs can also improve the reliability of the soft sensor as using more input sensors increase the chance of failure from sensor breakdowns assuming the soft sensor model requires a dense input vector however for model accuracy the primary benefit of reducing the input variables is to reduce multicollinearity multicollinearity means that each input variable can be linearly regressed from the other input variables this implies that there are interactions between the input variables in such cases each input variable appears to account for more of the variance in the target parameter resulting in very large model coefficients when the model has been calibrated using mathematical optimization this makes the model very sensitive to changes in the input variables which can lead to poor estimations when inputs that were not part of the training set are used i e overfitting multicollinearity can be expected from related parameters in some cases studies measure an input parameter at different points in treatment one example is measuring do in both the anaerobic tank and the oxic tank to estimate the value of an effluent parameter for modelling effluent tp zhu et al 10 omitted the use of do in the anaerobic tank as an input another potential relationship is between bod and organic nitrogen in tn or bod and the organic components of tss ebrahimi et al 20 avoided overfitting from using these parameters as inputs by using interaction terms derived from a principal component analysis pca inputs in a time series may also be liable to result in multicollinearity measures of the same parameter taken from the influent and the effluent respectively may share some correlation if the treatment process is stable enough aside from using influent and effluent parameters as input sensors fernandez de canete et al 16 used parameters sampled at different intervals as online monitoring systems become more common the availability of continuous data yields many collinear potential inputs for soft sensor modelling alternatively with methods such as pca and pls this can be an opportunity to identify the best intervals for sampling input parameters in relation qin et al 39 used uv vis spectra as input sensors for estimating wastewater quality as the apparatus could measure this from a variety of wavelengths the authors were able to use a modified pls model to select the inputs for the soft sensor redundant input variables can be removed based on their pls regression coefficient pls raises the model coefficients of inputs that share the highest covariance with the target parameter 66 in this way the least redundant input variables will have the highest regression coefficient alternatively pca derives the principal components independent linear transformations of the input variables these components do not interact and using them as inputs for the model can help avoid overfitting 12 ling sun 2020 applications of pls and pca on cases with a high potential for multicollinearity are given in table 5 it is notable that not all studies applied methods to address the multicollinearity between input sensors despite this some soft sensors without these methods had relatively good accuracy based on r2 and rmse measures still studies which were able to make the comparison between applying pca pls and the related methods noted that there was an improvement over model development with the collinear inputs liu et al 66 recorded an improvement in r2 in applying kernel pls to select inputs zhu et al 10 noted that there was a reduction in rmse from their soft sensor in the context of data abundance the potential of multicollinearity cannot be ignored and must be considered in soft sensor development in real wastewater treatment the target parameter may be affected by factors not recorded in the dataset clustering can help take these factors into consideration by dividing the dataset into sub populations based on the available input parameters k means clustering applied by grieu et al 23 arranges the data into k clusters such that each sample is assigned based on the mean of the cluster it is closest to under k means clustering the number of clusters are arbitrarily specified a density based clustering algorithm is based on the idea that cluster centers are denser and thus can be used as a way to identify the clusters this form of clustering was applied by li and zhang 67 specifically on the weather conditions during wastewater treatment noting that this will result in different forms of nonlinearity in influent behaviour likewise heo et al 68 segmented the dataset by applying fuzzy c means clustering on the influent parameters this differs from k means clustering in the sense that each sample can be a member of multiple clusters in varying degrees based on a probability value because of sensor interference measurement noise and other random noise the values of the input data may include some inaccuracies as this may skew the estimations of the soft sensor the noisy data needs to be corrected wavelet transforms can extract the true value of wastewater parameter based on the frequency of the values 9 exponential smoothing may reduce random noise in time series with short intervals by updating the value of the parameter relative to its previous values 18 machine learning models such as auto encoders seek to recreate the original data thereby creating an understanding of the underlying distribution and consequently obtaining the true value of the parameter 33 we note that as most studies use historical data over the course of several months in modelling e g the dataset of pai et al 15 runs from january 3 to september 30 it may not be possible to know the true noise free value of the data even laboratory measurements may be subject to some degree of noise making it hard to validate the denoising methods yet these denoising methods may still amplify features in the input data which can potentially improve soft sensor accuracy neural networks in particular include a variety of hyperparameters these consist of the number of hidden layers in the model the number of hidden neurons in the model and even the activation function applied at each neuron the genetic algorithm is an efficient search algorithm which can be applied to identify the combination of hyperparameters that will result in the best model performance it is based on the process of natural selection which uses both random mutation and selection based on good outcomes as a means of optimization 49 however it can also be a lengthy process requiring the development of multiple models alternatives such as the self organizing neural network of li et al 69 algorithmically defines its own architecture as the model coefficients are calibrated which may lead to faster convergence 4 future developments in relation to hardware sensor technology the reliability and accuracy of any soft sensor is dependent on the quality of its input sensors with the advent of electrochemical sensors it has become possible to have accurate low cost and relatively durable hardware sensors these sensors work by equating a wastewater parameter to the amount of electric current produced from an electrochemical reaction the potential of microorganisms in generating these electrochemical reactions has been considered 70 immobilized microorganisms from the activated sludge used in wastewater treatment can be used 71 specific cultures have also been considered in biosensor development such as bacillus subtilis 72 trichosporon cutaneum 73 and aeromonas hydrophila 74 these cultures were selected based on qualities such as linear range response time and stability the linear range of a sensor refers to the range of readings that share a linear relationship with the signal measured by the sensor this measure is important as a wider range of measurement for the input sensors would also expand the range of the soft sensor for which these inputs are the basis there have been notable improvements in the range of bod sensors e g the amperometric sensor of velling and tenno 71 had a range of 15 to 50 mg l while the microbial fuel cell based sensors of modin and wilén 70 had a range of 32 to 1280 mg l in cod measurement there has been an expansion in range from 4 8 to 600 mg l 13 to 1 44 to 672 mg l 75 nitrate and nitrite sensors also have a significantly wider range from 0 28 to 28 mg l 76 to 0 084 to 1120 mg l 93 apart from the width of the linear range for measurement these sensors have also improved in sensitivity for lower levels of pollutants the no3 sensor of bagheri et al 17 can detect levels as low as 0 0028 mg l the cod sensor of kangkun and ponchio 90 has a lower limit of 0 mg l this can allow for more precise measurements for cases where the standards for wastewater quality are very stringent response time is also an important aspect of online measurement referring to the lead time needed for the input sensors to take measurements the total lead time of the soft sensor is based on the response time of the input sensors as well as the computing time for the model making response time doubly important in the feasibility of soft sensors for bod measurement shorter response times can be observed in the sensors developed by velling and tenno 71 at 12 to 15 min and the sensor of raud et al 74 at 10 to 20 min the flow based sensor of modin and wilén 70 has a longer lead time of 5 to 12 h but this also significantly extends the linear range of the soft sensor although these lead times are still inconvenient in the context of real time monitoring they nonetheless shorten the typical bod measurement process i e 5 days cod measurements have been shortened from the typical 30 min to 180 480 s based on the nano copper sensor developed by yang et al 13 nitrite can be measured as quickly as 20 s 76 the bioelectrochemical sensor requires recalibration throughout its lifespan which culminates as the microorganism culture used to stimulate the reaction fully degrades stress tests have revealed that most recent sensors can last at least 30 days these sensors include the no3 sensor of aravamudhan and bhansali 76 the cod sensor of si et al 75 and the cod sensor of liang et al 14 input sensors with longer lifespans are desirable as these result in better stability for the soft sensor the bod sensor of raud et al 74 has a relatively long lifespan of 110 to 115 days even some of the more recent sensors have shorter lifespans e g 9 days for the no3 sensor of fan et al 77 and 10 18 days for the no3 sensor of xiao et al 78 alternatively if soft sensors are being used to support hardware sensors in a monitoring system knowledge of the lifespans of specific hardware sensors can be used to identify when it is necessary to recalibrate the hardware sensors and switch to soft sensors electrochemical sensors for wastewater have also been extended to new pollutants of concern aside from the standard wwtp monitoring parameters the presence of heavy metals in wastewater is a problem in some industrial settings using gold silver oxides a cr iii vi sensor with a wide range of detection was developed 79 a modified carbon electrode sensor was developed for as iii which demonstrated robust performance against interference from other metal ions 80 the fe iii sensor of badakhshan et al 81 had a fast response time of 12 s and was stable for up to 60 days of operation aside from metals kojic acid is another parameter of interest for which a robust sensor has been developed 82 sensor interference is another common problem while some recent hardware sensors have been enhanced to improve their robustness against interference from various compounds this problem can also be addressed with data driven modelling a data driven error compensation algorithm has been developed to address ph interference in the operation of a pb ii ion selective membrane sensor 1 this addresses one of the key advantages of the membrane sensor which is otherwise inexpensive and highly durable alternatively another error compensation algorithm has been developed to address k interference for a nh4 sensor 4 in both cases the error compensation extends the useful lifetime of the sensor without needing recalibration or maintenance arguably the advancements in hardware sensor technology may eventually render soft sensors redundant however it is worth noting that the hardware sensors tend to have a limited linear range whereas soft sensors are typically developed with nonlinear modelling approaches when there is a need to develop sensors for novel parameters of interest e g e coli concentration in foschi et al 5 the development of soft sensors has a shorter lead time if the data is available finally the error compensation algorithms applied by fan et al 1 and wang et al 4 and switching algorithms between hardware and soft sensors 65 have illustrated that hardware and soft sensors can be used together to improve the overall scope and accuracy of wwtp monitoring systems 5 conclusions this literature review covered 102 studies on soft sensor development for wastewater treatment it sought to identify the relevant changes in soft sensor development over time and the implications of these changes for future studies specifically the following conclusions were reached 1 the development and application of wwtp soft sensors have increased significantly over the years particularly because of the variety in target parameters for soft sensor development 2 although many wwtp soft sensors have been developed an overall state of the art cannot be identified because of the differences in the context of development and application 3 neural networks are still the most popular modelling approach however new families of machine learning models have emerged in recent years with better generalizability for various data distributions e g kernel methods for limited or noisy data decision tree based methods for skewed distribution 4 adjunct methods for soft sensor modelling i e statistical methods for selecting input sensors denoising are worth exploring as these methods directly address problematic characteristics of the dataset as opposed to making the soft sensor more robust against them 5 the hardware of input sensors has also advanced significantly in terms of accuracy and durability but further improvements in response time may be necessary for real time monitoring and control declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this review paper 
13274,solar still based on floating absorber capable of heat localization has gained popularity in the recent years for water distillation owing to its superior design functionality and energy utilization however as the design is relatively new there are various aspects of such a design especially the vapour space that must be examined in detail to improve the still productivity under actual working conditions the present study investigates the influence of the various parameters in the vapour space like the internal relative humidity vapour space temperature and glass cover temperature on the performance of a three layer multi purpose floating absorber t ss304cc based solar still the diurnal performance of the multilayer absorber in a passive still is compared with an aluminium floating absorber based solar still it was found that the relative humidity and vapour space temperature adversely affected the solar still productivity of the modified still in the afternoon hours the vapour space temperature of t ss304cc still increased by nearly 133 similarly the internal relative humidity of the modified still was 38 lower than the aluminium based still on the same day due to the increase in vapour space temperature based on cost analysis it was estimated that the cost per litre of freshwater would decrease by nearly 36 as compared to the reference still in the absence of the adverse effect of the vapour space keywords solar still water distillation solar energy floating absorber renewable energy solar thermal conversion 1 introduction the access to potable water supply is essential to the survival of human beings on this planet many factors such as exponential growth in population urbanization climate change environmental deterioration etc have resulted in the depletion of available freshwater reserves interestingly the problem of potable water shortage is no longer confined to the poor or underdeveloped nations within the next few years more than 70 of the world population will be adversely affected by water shortage 1 the solution to this problem lies in producing freshwater in a sustainable and environmental friendly manner by utilizing renewable energy solar based distillation could be the most appropriate technology to address the freshwater scarcity of a country like india which is known to receive up to 7 kwh m2 daily average solar radiation 2 considering the overall socio economic scenario of the country a cost effective solar distillation system would be more ideal especially in villages and remote locations where small communities thrive on local resources solar still distillation system can meet the water needs of small communities in an economical and hassle free manner based on a detailed review it was found that the selection of the type of still must be decided based on local operating conditions 3 the factors which influence the evaporation condensation phenomena inside a passive solar still were also critically analysed in the literature 4 solar stills have undergone many design modifications over the years in order to achieve improved performance the usage of floating perforated aluminium black plate is found to enhance the output of the solar still by 40 for a feedwater depth of 6 cm 5 a comparative study on the floating absorbers made of different materials identified aluminium as a good choice for use as floating solar absorber 6 a recent trend in solar still design is the use of multi layer floating absorber which has proven to enhance the still output 7 10 a multi layer floating system works on the principle of interfacial heating or heat localization concentrating thermal energy at the air feedwater interface to enable effective utilization of available solar power a double slope solar still was successfully operated with a two layer floating absorber with salt rejection capability 8 multilayer floating absorbers were also fabricated using cost effective materials such as candle soot coated cotton fabric suspended on polystyrene foam the experiments using this system under natural sunlight attained a solar thermal conversion efficiency of nearly 80 9 the temperature of the vapour space above the floating absorber can influence the distillate output of solar still with three layer floating absorber 10 since the floating absorber designs in solar still are relatively new there is need for more investigations to get a better understanding of its design and the effect of various operating parameters on still productivity as the feed water in the case of multi layer floating system is isolated from the solar thermal process with the help of the insulation layer the vapour space between the absorber surface and the glass cover will have a strong influence in the performance an investigation on low thermal inertia based floating materials in solar stills suggested that the solar still yield may depend on factors other than evaporation potential 11 higher glass cover temperature is also reported to adversely affect the still output 12 in addition to this the vapour space temperature 13 14 and vapour content corresponding

travel distance solar stills were covered using plain glass of thickness 3 mm and both stills were positioned to face south direction in order to receive maximum solar radiation two layer insulation was provided to minimize heat transfer between solar stills and the ambient air inner layer in contact with the gi sheet was made of hd thermocol 40 mm thick and the outer layer was plywood 12 mm thick the details regarding the solar stills are depicted in the schematic diagram shown in fig 2 3 2 description of floating absorber a novel three layer floating absorber design is used in this work t ss304cc the component on the top of the multi layer floating system is a spectrally selective solar absorber ssa made of thermally oxidized stainless steel t ss304 this material was chosen due to its low cost besides it can be prepared without any elaborate treatment and the preparation method is easily scalable the high absorptivity and low emissivity stainless steel based solar absorber sheet was prepared by following the procedure adopted by wu et al 20 ss304 was heat treated inside a furnace at 950 c for 2 h in the presence of air resulting in the formation of iron oxide layer with spectral selective property the bottom layer of the three layer absorber system was biodegradable carbon foam made from wheat flour the bio carbon foam acts as the structural support for the floating absorber with its stiffness and low density it also provides thermal insulation to minimize heat dissipation to the feedwater below the floating system which aids in interfacial heating in order to make the carbon foam at first a porous structure was prepared by baking wheat dough in a large oven for 30 min it was then left for drying at 75 c for about 20 h next the dried porous structure was carbonized in a muffle furnace at a temperature of 350 c resulting in the formation of carbon foam heat treatment at 350 c helps in the formation of defects and organic impurities which impede phonon transfer 21 since thermal energy transfer in carbon based materials occur by phonon transfer 22 23 wheat flour based carbon foam has low thermal conductivity the arrangement of the novel multi layer floating absorber is shown in fig 3 the prepared carbon foam was wrapped using food grade ldpe sheet a pu foam of 5 mm thickness was placed on top of the carbon foam to make the surface flat the carbon foam together with the thin pu sheet acts as the bottom layer of the floating system the bottom layer was then wrapped with cotton cloth as shown in fig 3 to ensure a 2d water path by capillary action which is found to be effective 24 the thermally treated top layer of the floating absorber t ss304 enables photothermal conversion thereby heating up the cotton fabric t ss304 was provided with circular holes as shown in fig 3 this helps the feedwater that rises up the cotton cloth by capillary action to easily evaporate through the holes and produce freshwater a reference still was used in the present study to investigate the relative performance of the modified still with three layer floating absorber the reference still uses a simple aluminium al floating absorber since its design is similar to that of the absorber used in the modified still moreover the performance of the floating aluminium based solar still is better when compared to the conventional solar still as mentioned in the literature review the aluminium absorber was coated with black paint to enhance its solar absorptivity the thermal concentration tc of the solar absorber defined as the ratio of the basin area to the evaporation area determines the number of holes on the solar absorber tc was fixed at 8 for both t ss304 absorber as well as aluminium absorber to ensure sufficient evaporation area for effective evaporation 25 3 3 experimental procedure and measurement the experiments were carried out on the roof top of the school of materials science and engineering nit calicut india from 9 am to 4 pm on

corresponding to 25th april 28th april and 3rd may respectively the average solar intensity for 25th april 28th april and 3rd may respectively were 389 w m2 429 w m2 and 507 w m2 the maximum solar intensity recorded during the test days were 1081 w m2 on 25th may 889 w m2 on 28th may and 858 w m2 on 3rd may the ambient temperature during the experimental runs increased as the day progressed with the maximum recorded values of 34 9 c 33 9 c and 35 2 c on 25th april 28th april and 3rd may respectively it gradually dropped down as expected towards the evening fig 4 d f shows the comparison of floating absorber and glass cover temperatures of both stills for test days corresponding to 25th april 28th april and 3rd may respectively the absorber temperature for the t ss304cc still was found to be higher as compared to al still up to about 3 30 pm for all days tested the maximum absorber temperature recorded for t ss304cc was 84 4 c on 5th april the maximum solar intensity of 1081 w m2 was also recorded on the same day among the three experimental runs as shown in table 2 5 2 solar thermal conversion and evaporation potential of solar stills the superior absorber temperature of the t ss304cc still is attributed to the better solar thermal conversion capability of the t ss304 solar selective layer as illustrated in fig 5 the maximum solar thermal efficiency obtained was nearly 81 on 25th april the enhancement in solar thermal efficiency of t ss304cc still was found to be more evident in the afternoon as compared to the morning hours towards evening solar thermal efficiency of aluminium absorber was found to decrease further as observed in fig 5 on account of the higher emissivity of aluminium absorber in the infrared region of the solar spectrum the remarkable solar to thermal conversion of t ss304 ssa is owing to its high absorptivity αt ss304 0 918 0 007 αal 0 904 0 006 in the near visible visible and near infrared spectrum as depicted in fig 6 the sem image as shown in fig 7 reveals the rhombus grain morphology with irregular shaped structure formation as a result of the thermal oxidation of ss304 which gives it a 3d structural arrangement enhancing the scattering based on the calculation using eq 3 emissivity of t ss304 sheet was found to be relatively low ℇt ss304 0 145 0 023 ℇal 0 232 0 027 which would result in minimal radiative heat loss in addition to the spectral selective top layer the use of insulating layer at the bottom of t ss304cc floating absorber enabled heat localization at the absorber surface as can be verified by the relatively low bulk feedwater temperature for t ss304cc still fig s1 supplementary data which further enhanced the absorber temperature it may be noted that the time to achieve maximum absorber temperature tsmax once the highest radiation intensity from the sun was recorded is relatively less for t ss304cc absorber as compared to al absorber for example it took just 7 min for the modified absorber to achieve tsmax on 28th april as against 202 min for the case of aluminium absorber as shown in table 2 a similar trend may be observed for other two days as displayed in table 2 this clearly demonstrates better sensitivity and response of the proposed floating absorber fig 8 represents the variation of the difference in absorber surface temperature and glass cover temperature δts g with time for t ss304cc still and al still respectively δts g signifies the evaporation strength of a solar still the higher the value of δts g the higher is the rate of evaporation thus leading to enhanced still productivity 33 fig 8 indicates better evaporation strength for the t ss304cc still for most part of the experimental run on all three days considered this is because of the higher δts g of t ss304cc still compared to al still 5 3 solar still productivity fig 9 a c shows the comparison of still productivity with time for both stills for test days corresponding to 25th april 28th april and 6th may respectively still productivity is measured on an hourly basis it may be observed that still productivity for t ss304cc still is greater than al still till 1 pm for all three test days considered this is also reflected in the better cumulative output for t ss304cc still up to 1 pm for all days of testing the enhancement in cumulative output for the modified still till afternoon is 59 5 126 7 and 48 4 respectively on 25th april 28th april and 6th may respectively this indicates the quick response of the proposed floating absorber system for freshwater production however in the afternoon still productivity of t ss304cc still is found to be decreasing or less than that of aluminium still a similar trend was observed for all three experimental runs despite its better evaporation potential as mentioned earlier t ss304cc still displayed reduced productivity this confirms that the still productivity for floating absorber based solar still will depend on other factors related to the vapour space of the solar still 5 4 relative humidity and vapour space temperature freshwater production in a floating absorber solar still depends on the evaporation at the absorber surface interface and the condensation that occur at the glass cover to understand the influence of the proposed floating absorber on the condensation phenomena at the glass cover internal relative humidity of the two solar stills were determined internal relative humidity of a solar still is the measure of the amount of moisture in the region between the absorber surface and the glass cover i e the vapour space at a given temperature and pressure higher relative humidity implies higher degree of saturation and therefore more possibility for condensation and vice versa relative humidity was calculated using the eq 4 fig 10 shows the internal relative humidity variation during the run time of both solar stills on 25th april 28th april and 6th may respectively it may be noted that relative humidity decreases in the afternoon for both stills interestingly the relative humidity for t ss304cc still is found to be decreasing in comparison with aluminium still with time especially in the afternoon hours this implies that rate of condensation of t ss304cc still was adversely affected in the afternoon hours the vapour space temperature near the glass cover was analysed to further understand the reason for the decrease in relative humidity of the t ss304cc still fig 11 presents the variation of vapour space temperature near glass cover denoted by δtv g for both stills on the test days it may be noted that vapour space temperature is more for the t ss304cc still as compared to aluminium still for most part of the day more importantly there is an increase in δtv g for t ss304cc in the afternoon hours owing to the enhanced thermal energy utilization at the absorber interface as a consequence of its better optical properties and heat localization since the saturation pressure increases exponentially with temperature it improves the water vapour holding capacity in the vapour space of t ss304cc still this theory substantiates the above mentioned decrease in the internal relative humidity of the floating absorber based solar still with t ss304cc absorber moreover the high vapour space temperature near the absorber surface of t ss304cc still also implies lower relative humidity this further confirms the high evaporation potential near the absorber interface of the modified still fig s2 supplementary data therefore the adverse effect on freshwater productivity of the modified still with multi functional floating absorber is associated with the condensation potential near the glass cover rather than the evaporation potential near the absorber interface 5 5 adverse effect of vapour space temperature on modified still 5 5 1 solar still efficiency fig 12 presents the solar still efficiency on an hourly basis for aluminium still as well as t ss304cc still it may be observed that the solar still efficiency is better for modified still in the morning hours the better still efficiency for t ss304cc in the morning hours is because of its higher distillate output this also indicates the ability of t ss304cc still to quickly start freshwater production once the system begins its operation however in the afternoon especially after 1 pm still efficiency for aluminium still is higher than t ss304cc still this is because of the adverse effect of vapour space temperature causing a drop in distillate output further it may be noted that the solar still efficiency is significantly more for aluminium still as compared to t ss304cc still towards the evening with the values mostly exceeding 100 for aluminium still it is due to the fact that aluminium still has better heat storage capacity the heat energy stored gets released in the late afternoon hours producing additional freshwater despite the poor solar radiation received towards the evening 5 5 2 cost analysis a cost analysis was carried out to further highlight the adverse effect that the vapour space temperature creates in the afternoon hours on the overall performance of the proposed floating absorber based still table 3 illustrates the fixed expense which sums up the fabrication cost incurred for making solar still of 1 m2 area fixed expense is calculated for both aluminium still and t ss304cc still as shown in table 3 the cost per litre of freshwater produced by a solar still is determined by calculating the total annual expense and dividing it by the yearly freshwater produced in litres total annual expense tac depends on annual fixed expense af cost involved in annual operation and maintenance amc and the annual salvage expense asv annual salvage expense is calculated by considering the salvage cost and the sinking fund factor similarly annual fixed expense af is a function of capital recovery factor cr and the fixed expense f incurred for the solar still fabrication the various cost parameters are calculated using the equations listed in table 3 34 the life time of solar still is assumed as 10 years the interest rate r of 12 was considered for calculating capital recovery and sinking fund all the assumed terms such as interest rate r salvage cost rate 20 fixed expense annual operation and maintenance rate 30 annual fixed expense life time of solar still n are chosen based on standard values considered in latest literature on solar still 34 35 table 3 also compares the cost of freshwater produced for both t ss304cc still and aluminium still it may be noted that cost per litre for the modified still is 0 061 l whereas for aluminium still it is 0 052 l for the day time operation however the per litre cost becomes 0 118 and 0 184 respectively for t ss304cc still and aluminium still respectively if the stills operate till 1 pm in the afternoon for an year the cost of freshwater production decreased by about 36 by using the modified still till the afternoon hours when the negative effect of vapour space temperature is not present from this it may be inferred that the reduction in freshwater production of t ss304cc still in the afternoon due to the reduction in internal relative humidity caused by vapour space effect increased the cost per litre of freshwater by nearly 18 5 for the diurnal operation 6 conclusions the influence of different vapour space parameters on the performance of floating absorber based solar stills were investigated a multilayer floating absorber t ss304cc satisfying the desired characteristic features of high absorptivity in the solar thermal spectrum lower emissivity in the far ir spectrum thermal insulation for heat localization and continuous two dimensional water transport by capillary action for effective feedwater evaporation were used the reference still employed a black paint coated perforated aluminium sheet floating absorber the performance analysis of the modified still and the reference still was compared based on outdoor experiments conducted on 25th april 28th april and 6th may respectively from 9 am to 4 pm in india under tropical conditions where the daily average solar intensity varied between 385 w m2 to 510 w m2 and the ambient temperature recorded was in the range between 33 5 c to 35 5 c t ss304cc absorber exhibited higher solar thermal conversion efficiency of nearly 81 when compared to aluminium absorber the modified still with t ss304cc absorber displayed better sensitivity and faster response to change in solar intensity which was also reflected in the hourly distillate output especially in the morning hours however in the afternoon the internal relative humidity of t ss304cc still decreased with a maximum reduction of 38 on 25th april run compared to the aluminium still as a result of the spike in vapour space temperature this adversely affected the productivity of the modified still the negative impact of vapour space parameters on t ss304cc still was also reflected in the still efficiency for instance on 28th april still efficiency of t ss304cc still was 4 times better than aluminium still at 11 am in the morning however the solar still efficiency was about 0 3 times less for modified still by 3 pm on the same day similarly the cost of fresh water production increased nearly 18 5 as a result of the

13274,solar still based on floating absorber capable of heat localization has gained popularity in the recent years for water distillation owing to its superior design functionality and energy utilization however as the design is relatively new there are various aspects of such a design especially the vapour space that must be examined in detail to improve the still productivity under actual working conditions the present study investigates the influence of the various parameters in the vapour space like the internal relative humidity vapour space temperature and glass cover temperature on the performance of a three layer multi purpose floating absorber t ss304cc based solar still the diurnal performance of the multilayer absorber in a passive still is compared with an aluminium floating absorber based solar still it was found that the relative humidity and vapour space temperature adversely affected the solar still productivity of the modified still in the afternoon hours the vapour space temperature of t ss304cc still increased by nearly 133 similarly the internal relative humidity of the modified still was 38 lower than the aluminium based still on the same day due to the increase in vapour space temperature based on cost analysis it was estimated that the cost per litre of freshwater would decrease by nearly 36 as compared to the reference still in the absence of the adverse effect of the vapour space keywords solar still water distillation solar energy floating absorber renewable energy solar thermal conversion 1 introduction the access to potable water supply is essential to the survival of human beings on this planet many factors such as exponential growth in population urbanization climate change environmental deterioration etc have resulted in the depletion of available freshwater reserves interestingly the problem of potable water shortage is no longer confined to the poor or underdeveloped nations within the next few years more than 70 of the world population will be adversely affected by water shortage 1 the solution to this problem lies in producing freshwater in a sustainable and environmental friendly manner by utilizing renewable energy solar based distillation could be the most appropriate technology to address the freshwater scarcity of a country like india which is known to receive up to 7 kwh m2 daily average solar radiation 2 considering the overall socio economic scenario of the country a cost effective solar distillation system would be more ideal especially in villages and remote locations where small communities thrive on local resources solar still distillation system can meet the water needs of small communities in an economical and hassle free manner based on a detailed review it was found that the selection of the type of still must be decided based on local operating conditions 3 the factors which influence the evaporation condensation phenomena inside a passive solar still were also critically analysed in the literature 4 solar stills have undergone many design modifications over the years in order to achieve improved performance the usage of floating perforated aluminium black plate is found to enhance the output of the solar still by 40 for a feedwater depth of 6 cm 5 a comparative study on the floating absorbers made of different materials identified aluminium as a good choice for use as floating solar absorber 6 a recent trend in solar still design is the use of multi layer floating absorber which has proven to enhance the still output 7 10 a multi layer floating system works on the principle of interfacial heating or heat localization concentrating thermal energy at the air feedwater interface to enable effective utilization of available solar power a double slope solar still was successfully operated with a two layer floating absorber with salt rejection capability 8 multilayer floating absorbers were also fabricated using cost effective materials such as candle soot coated cotton fabric suspended on polystyrene foam the experiments using this system under natural sunlight attained a solar thermal conversion efficiency of nearly 80 9 the temperature of the vapour space above the floating absorber can influence the distillate output of solar still with three layer floating absorber 10 since the floating absorber designs in solar still are relatively new there is need for more investigations to get a better understanding of its design and the effect of various operating parameters on still productivity as the feed water in the case of multi layer floating system is isolated from the solar thermal process with the help of the insulation layer the vapour space between the absorber surface and the glass cover will have a strong influence in the performance an investigation on low thermal inertia based floating materials in solar stills suggested that the solar still yield may depend on factors other than evaporation potential 11 higher glass cover temperature is also reported to adversely affect the still output 12 in addition to this the vapour space temperature 13 14 and vapour content corresponding to a given vapour temperature 15 are also identified as influential parameters in determining solar still productivity the productivity of solar stills with floating absorbers capable of interfacial heating is influenced by the condensation of humid air on the glass cover 16 the factors contributing to this such as internal relative humidity are not extensively discussed in literature therefore a

corresponding to 25th april 28th april and 3rd may respectively the average solar intensity for 25th april 28th april and 3rd may respectively were 389 w m2 429 w m2 and 507 w m2 the maximum solar intensity recorded during the test days were 1081 w m2 on 25th may 889 w m2 on 28th may and 858 w m2 on 3rd may the ambient temperature during the experimental runs increased as the day progressed with the maximum recorded values of 34 9 c 33 9 c and 35 2 c on 25th april 28th april and 3rd may respectively it gradually dropped down as expected towards the evening fig 4 d f shows the comparison of floating absorber and glass cover temperatures of both stills for test days corresponding to 25th april 28th april and 3rd may respectively the absorber temperature for the t ss304cc still was found to be higher as compared to al still up to about 3 30 pm for all days tested the maximum absorber temperature recorded for t ss304cc was 84 4 c on 5th april the maximum solar intensity of 1081 w m2 was also recorded on the same day among the three experimental runs as shown in table 2 5 2 solar thermal conversion and evaporation potential of solar stills the superior absorber temperature of the t ss304cc still is attributed to the better solar thermal conversion capability of the t ss304 solar selective layer as illustrated in fig 5 the maximum solar thermal efficiency obtained was nearly 81 on 25th april the enhancement in solar thermal efficiency of t ss304cc still was found to be more evident in the afternoon as compared to the morning hours towards evening solar thermal efficiency of aluminium absorber was found to decrease further as observed in fig 5 on account of the higher emissivity of aluminium absorber in the infrared region of the solar spectrum the remarkable solar to thermal conversion of t ss304 ssa is owing to its high absorptivity αt ss304 0 918 0 007 αal 0 904 0 006 in the near visible visible and near infrared spectrum as depicted in fig 6 the sem image as shown in fig 7 reveals the rhombus grain morphology with irregular shaped structure formation as a result of the thermal oxidation of ss304 which gives it a 3d structural arrangement enhancing the scattering based on the calculation using eq 3 emissivity of t ss304 sheet was found to be relatively low ℇt ss304 0 145 0 023 ℇal 0 232 0 027 which would result in minimal radiative heat loss in addition to the spectral selective top layer the use of insulating layer at the bottom of t ss304cc floating absorber enabled heat localization at the absorber surface as can be verified by the relatively low bulk feedwater temperature for t ss304cc still fig s1 supplementary data which further enhanced the absorber temperature it may be noted that the time to achieve maximum absorber temperature tsmax once the highest radiation intensity from the sun was recorded is relatively less for t ss304cc absorber as compared to al absorber for example it took just 7 min for the modified absorber to achieve tsmax on 28th april as against 202 min for the case of aluminium absorber as shown in table 2 a similar trend may be observed for other two days as displayed in table 2 this clearly demonstrates better sensitivity and response of the proposed floating absorber fig 8 represents the variation of the difference in absorber surface temperature and glass cover temperature δts g with time for t ss304cc still and al still respectively δts g signifies the evaporation strength of a solar still the higher the value of δts g the higher is the rate of evaporation thus leading to enhanced still productivity 33 fig 8 indicates better evaporation strength for the t ss304cc still for most part of the experimental run on all three days considered this is because of the higher δts g of t ss304cc still compared to al still 5 3 solar still productivity fig 9 a c shows the comparison of still productivity with time for both stills for test days corresponding to 25th april 28th april and 6th may respectively still productivity is measured on an hourly basis it may be observed that still productivity for t ss304cc still is greater than al still till 1 pm for all three test days considered this is also reflected in the better cumulative output for t ss304cc still up to 1 pm for all days of testing the enhancement in cumulative output for the modified still till afternoon is 59 5 126 7 and 48 4 respectively on 25th april 28th april and 6th may respectively this indicates the quick response of the proposed floating absorber system for freshwater production however in the afternoon still productivity of t ss304cc still is found to be decreasing or less than that of aluminium still a similar trend was observed for all three experimental runs despite its better evaporation potential as mentioned earlier t ss304cc still displayed reduced productivity this confirms that the still productivity for floating absorber based solar still will depend on other factors related to the vapour space of the solar still 5 4 relative humidity and vapour space temperature freshwater production in a floating absorber solar still depends on the evaporation at the absorber surface interface and the condensation that occur at the glass cover to understand the influence of the proposed floating absorber on the condensation phenomena at the glass cover internal relative humidity of the two solar stills were determined internal relative humidity of a solar still is the measure of the amount of moisture in the region between the absorber surface and the glass cover i e the vapour space at a given temperature and pressure higher relative humidity implies higher degree of saturation and therefore more possibility for condensation and vice versa relative humidity was calculated using the eq 4 fig 10 shows the internal relative humidity variation during the run time of both solar stills on 25th april 28th april and 6th may respectively it may be noted that relative humidity decreases in the afternoon for both stills interestingly the relative humidity for t ss304cc still is found to be decreasing in comparison with aluminium still with time especially in the afternoon hours this implies that rate of condensation of t ss304cc still was adversely affected in the afternoon hours the vapour space temperature near the glass cover was analysed to further understand the reason for the decrease in relative humidity of the t ss304cc still fig 11 presents the variation of vapour space temperature near glass cover denoted by δtv g for both stills on the test days it may be noted that vapour space temperature is more for the t ss304cc still as compared to aluminium still for most part of the day more importantly there is an increase in δtv g for t ss304cc in the afternoon hours owing to the enhanced thermal energy utilization at the absorber interface as a consequence of its better optical properties and heat localization since the saturation pressure increases exponentially with temperature it improves the water vapour holding capacity in the vapour space of t ss304cc still this theory substantiates the above mentioned decrease in the internal relative humidity of the floating absorber based solar still with t ss304cc absorber moreover the high vapour space temperature near the absorber surface of t ss304cc still also implies lower relative humidity this further confirms the high evaporation potential near the absorber interface of the modified still fig s2 supplementary data therefore the adverse effect on freshwater productivity of the modified still with multi functional floating absorber is associated with the condensation potential near the glass cover rather than the evaporation potential near the absorber interface 5 5 adverse effect of vapour space temperature on modified still 5 5 1 solar still efficiency fig 12 presents the solar still efficiency on an hourly basis for aluminium still as well as t ss304cc still it may be observed that the solar still efficiency is better for modified still in the morning hours the better still efficiency for t ss304cc in the morning hours is because of its higher distillate output this also indicates the ability of t ss304cc still to quickly start freshwater production once the system begins its operation however in the afternoon especially after 1 pm still efficiency for aluminium still is higher than t ss304cc still this is because of the adverse effect of vapour space temperature causing a drop in distillate output further it may be noted that the solar still efficiency is significantly more for aluminium still as compared to t ss304cc still towards the evening with the values mostly exceeding 100 for aluminium still it is due to the fact that aluminium still has better heat storage capacity the heat energy stored gets released in the late afternoon hours producing additional freshwater despite the poor solar radiation received towards the evening 5 5 2 cost analysis a cost analysis was carried out to further highlight the adverse effect that the vapour space temperature creates in the afternoon hours on the overall performance of the proposed floating absorber based still table 3 illustrates the fixed expense which sums up the fabrication cost incurred for making solar still of 1 m2 area fixed expense is calculated for both aluminium still and t ss304cc still as shown in table 3 the cost per litre of freshwater produced by a solar still is determined by calculating the total annual expense and dividing it by the yearly freshwater produced in litres total annual expense tac depends on annual fixed expense af cost involved in annual operation and maintenance amc and the annual salvage expense asv annual salvage expense is calculated by considering the salvage cost and the sinking fund factor similarly annual fixed expense af is a function of capital recovery factor cr and the fixed expense f incurred for the solar still fabrication the various cost parameters are calculated using the equations listed in table 3 34 the life time of solar still is assumed as 10 years the interest rate r of 12 was considered for calculating capital recovery and sinking fund all the assumed terms such as interest rate r salvage cost rate 20 fixed expense annual operation and maintenance rate 30 annual fixed expense life time of solar still n are chosen based on standard values considered in latest literature on solar still 34 35 table 3 also compares the cost of freshwater produced for both t ss304cc still and aluminium still it may be noted that cost per litre for the modified still is 0 061 l whereas for aluminium still it is 0 052 l for the day time operation however the per litre cost becomes 0 118 and 0 184 respectively for t ss304cc still and aluminium still respectively if the stills operate till 1 pm in the afternoon for an year the cost of freshwater production decreased by about 36 by using the modified still till the afternoon hours when the negative effect of vapour space temperature is not present from this it may be inferred that the reduction in freshwater production of t ss304cc still in the afternoon due to the reduction in internal relative humidity caused by vapour space effect increased the cost per litre of freshwater by nearly 18 5 for the diurnal operation 6 conclusions the influence of different vapour space parameters on the performance of floating absorber based solar stills were investigated a multilayer floating absorber t ss304cc satisfying the desired characteristic features of high absorptivity in the solar thermal spectrum lower emissivity in the far ir spectrum thermal insulation for heat localization and continuous two dimensional water transport by capillary action for effective feedwater evaporation were used the reference still employed a black paint coated perforated aluminium sheet floating absorber the performance analysis of the modified still and the reference still was compared based on outdoor experiments conducted on 25th april 28th april and 6th may respectively from 9 am to 4 pm in india under tropical conditions where the daily average solar intensity varied between 385 w m2 to 510 w m2 and the ambient temperature recorded was in the range between 33 5 c to 35 5 c t ss304cc absorber exhibited higher solar thermal conversion efficiency of nearly 81 when compared to aluminium absorber the modified still with t ss304cc absorber displayed better sensitivity and faster response to change in solar intensity which was also reflected in the hourly distillate output especially in the morning hours however in the afternoon the internal relative humidity of t ss304cc still decreased with a maximum reduction of 38 on 25th april run compared to the aluminium still as a result of the spike in vapour space temperature this adversely affected the productivity of the modified still the negative impact of vapour space parameters on t ss304cc still was also reflected in the still efficiency for instance on 28th april still efficiency of t ss304cc still was 4 times better than aluminium still at 11 am in the morning however the solar still efficiency was about 0 3 times less for modified still by 3 pm on the same day similarly the cost of fresh water production increased nearly 18 5 as a result of the
