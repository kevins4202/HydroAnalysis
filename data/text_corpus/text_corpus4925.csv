24625,animal attached accelerometers have been widely used to monitor species that are difficult to observe alongside the use of machine learning to identify behaviours from the obtained sequences artificial neural networks are powerful supervised learning algorithms that are based on deep learning and have been poorly exploited in movement ecology recently the availability of sophisticated algorithmic architectures via open source libraries facilitates their use in this study we adapt a fully convolutional neural network that was originally developed for biomedical 3d image segmentation the v net we test it on a labelled dataset collected from animal borne video recorders combined with multi sensors accelerometers gyroscopes and depth recorders deployed on free ranging immature green turtles chelonia mydas the proposed model fitted for 1d data is able to predict six behavioural categories for green turtles with an auc score of 88 it shows a high ability to detect rare behaviours with low discriminative signals such as feeding and scratching with a precision down to one centisecond the v net circumvents the segmentation process we also show that the gyroscope is more informative than the accelerometer in identifying sea turtle behaviours and that the v net is not able to discriminate feeding from the raw data of accelerometer alone however human expertise can help to correct it with precise and adapted pre processing thus diverted from its initial purpose and tested on sea turtle the v net is a very efficient method of behavioural identification that should be easily generalized to a wide range of species it could lead to considerable progress in remote accelerometric monitoring and help to understand the ecology of the species that are difficult to observe furthermore as the model is light there is also a huge potential to implement a trained v net in satellite relay data tag to remotely predict the expressed behaviours almost instantly keywords deep learning accelerometer sea turtle ecology behavioural classification convolutional neural network 1 introduction machine learning has been widely used in behavioural studies to face the new challenges related to the development of animal attached sensors valletta et al 2017 wilson et al 2018 this technology allows scientists to remotely record a large amount of data on free ranging animals for which direct observations are impracticable boyd et al 2004 brown et al 2013 their use grew rapidly in the 1990s with the development of microprocessors and the increase in memory capacity but is now limited by the difficulties in processing the complexity and volume of the recorded data ropert coudert et al 2010 wilson et al 2018 in this context machine learning has showed up as a powerful tool to handle large datasets and automatically analyse multi sensor data an emerging field requiring machine learning is the automatic behavioural identification from accelerometer the accelerometer records the fine scale movements and body posture of the equipped animals from which behaviours can be identified brown et al 2013 it is possible to label the acceleration signals with the animal behaviours through a first validation step using visual observations then the labelled dataset is used to teach a supervised learning algorithm to automatically identify the behaviours from the acceleration sequences jeantet et al 2020a 2018 nathan et al 2012 shepard et al 2008 the best known supervised learning algorithms used for behavioural identification have mainly been based on decision trees cart random forest or extreme gradient boosting brewster et al 2018 graf et al 2015 linear hyperplane separation theorem support vector machine campbell et al 2013 martiskainen et al 2009 or even the minimum distance between the unknown instance and the training data k nearest neighbors bidder et al 2014 the advantages of these algorithms are that they are easy to implement thanks to the development of free computing libraries based on r and python programming languages and they produce a good outcome without requiring advanced skills however their effectiveness is still limited in identifying fine behaviours and they do not consider the temporal dimension of the data as they process data in independent segments artificial neural networks are other powerful learning algorithms these networks are computational models that translate an input signal through successive layers where linear and non linear transformation are performed into an output layer expressing the contained information neural networks are thus able to automatically detect by themselves very complex and highly discriminating features and patterns in the data chollet 2018 such models have won numerous contests in machine learning and constitute a large part of artificial intelligence they are quite flexible and can be used to analyse images sound texts and temporal series as multi sensor recording so far deep learning has been poorly exploited in automatic behavioural identification due to its complexity we can find fully connected neural networks which correspond to the most basic form of neural network but mainly in studies comparing the performance of machine learning in automatic animal behaviour classification ladds et al 2016 nathan et al 2012 resheff et al 2014 however machine learning experts have recently provided the architecture for increasingly sophisticated and efficient neural networks via open source libraries such as tensorflow by google or pytorch by facebook for example taking this opportunity and in order to automatically identify behaviour from multi sensor records we propose in this study to test a neural network that was originally developed for biomedical 3d image segmentation the v net milletari et al 2016 its good performances on pattern recognition are all the more interesting given that it required few training images despite a highly imbalanced dataset and it performed faster than other methods contrary to classical learning algorithms and fully connected neural networks the v net takes the temporal structure of the data into account as it integrates the notion of neighbourhood we present here an adaptive version of the v net for the multi sensor time series i e 1d signals to automatically identify the behaviours of green turtle chelonia mydas green turtles are long distance migrants with high diving abilities chambault et al 2015 lutz and bentley 1985 spotila 2004 which make impossible long term observation of their at sea behaviours in order to improve conservation measures for this threatened species classified as endangered species by the international union for conservation of nature seminoff 2004 it is essential to better know their behaviours and ecology in this study we focus particularly on immature green turtles residing on the coastal foraging grounds of martinique the population shows high fidelity to this developmental habitat where they spend many years foraging to grow before undertaking migration at the sexual maturity chambault et al 2018 siegwalt et al 2020 during immature stage green turtles are mostly grazing herbivores and mainly feed on seagrass and algae bjorndal et al 2000 howell 2012 while studying feeding behaviours of green turtles is particularly important to understand their ecology it is still difficult to identify it automatically from a sensor placed on the carapace in the attempt to automatically identify the at sea behaviours of green turtle with a particular focus on the feeding events we test the performance of the v net to classify their behaviours from multi sensor recordings we use a labelled dataset collected from animal borne video recorders combined with multi sensor recorders accelerometer gyroscope and time depth recorder deployed on free ranging immature green turtles in martinique jeantet et al 2020b the outcome of the v net could be compared to a method based on classical learning algorithms such as rf egb cart and svm developed from the same dataset in a previous study jeantet et al 2020a furthermore the use of the gyroscope is not so common in behavioural identification in ecology therefore we compare the performance of the v net according to the measuring device i e the gyroscope associated with the accelerometer the gyroscope alone or the accelerometer alone 2 materials and methods 2 1 dataset description and behavioural labelling the used dataset contains the tri axial acceleration and angular velocity of 13 free ranging green turtles recorded at a frequency of either 20 hz or 50 hz jeantet et al 2020b 2020a the depth profiles are also provided at 1 hz the devices were combined with a video recorder allowing us to validate the signals the video footage analysed using a handmade software written in python language hadetskyi 2019 enables the identification of 46 different behaviours regrouped into six categories breathing feeding gliding resting scratching and swimming see jeantet et al 2020a for the behavioural definitions all other behaviours that cannot be considered into these six categories are grouped into the other category the precise description of the dataset is provided in jeantet et al 2020a as well as the corresponding r script to visualize the labelled data through the rblt package fig 1 geiger 2019 to test the v net we synchronize the observed behavioural categories with the acceleration angular velocity and depth data subsample the 50 hz data at 20 hz and remove the unlabelled section we focus in particular on the feeding category which is particular difficult to discriminate in this study the green turtles mainly fed seagrass on the ground from which we identified two distinct behaviours the action of pulling on the seagrass that we referred as grabbing and the action of mastication referred as chewing the device being on their carapace those behaviours resulted in subtle variations hardly detectable fig 1 and supplementary materials thus in order to identify the feeding category we add specific adaptations to the v net 2 2 v net architecture the v net was first described and developed by milletari et al 2016 to treat medical images 3d signals it is an evolution of the u net developed for biomedical 2d images ronneberger et al 2015 the implementation of the both algorithms can be found in the respective articles milletari et al 2016 ronneberger et al 2015 in this work we present an adapted architecture for the v net which fits with our multi sensor data i e 1d temporal series fig 2 it has been implemented with the keras and tensorflow libraries through their python interface the v net is a fully convolutional neural network meaning that it is based only on a successive sequence of convolutions it consists of two parts an encoder path that compresses the signal and creates multiple features thus performing a multiscale analysis and a decoder path that synthesizes the created features to predict the output which in our case is the behaviours the breakdown of each step of the v net is as follows input 1 this corresponds to a sequence of multi sensor data containing all the descriptors the three acceleration axes the three gyroscope axes and the depth for example nb desc 7 over a window size fixed at 40 s ws 800 for sampling data at 20 hz initialization 2 we first perform two 1d convolutions with a kernel size of 5 each followed by a relu activation in this step we conserve the size of the window by adding a border of zero and increase the number of channels from nb desc to depth the latter is a parameter tuned to 32 during the tuning process see section 2 4 section 2 6 descending part encoder 3 the output feature maps are first down sampled by averaging a convolution of size 2 and stride 2 by doing this the importance of the location of the highlighted features is reduced then we perform two convolutions of size 5 followed by relu activations the output of the convolutions is actually added to the input signal of the corresponded level and is thus seen as additive modifications of the main stream this operation also called shortcut is represented by the dotted arrows on fig 2 it has been shown that it accelerates the training process and limits gradient vanishing or explosion problems see section 2 3 section 2 5 he et al 2016 we obtain some feature maps with a window size divided by 2 and the number of channels multiplied by 2 this sequence is repeated three times ascending part decoder 4 this works as a mirror of the descending part each transformation simultaneously increases the size of the window and decreases the number of channels by a factor of 2 technically we up sample the data using a transposed convolution dumoulin and visin 2016 of size 2 followed by two convolutions of size 5 with relu activations horizontal arrows 5 at each level of the ascending part the feature maps obtained in the ascents are combined with the features created by the descents using a summation final convolutions and softmax activation 6 we perform a convolution of size 1 to obtain a dimension corresponding to the number of possible predicted behaviours nb classes 8 then a softmax function normalizes the last layer to produce probabilities output 7 we obtain a window of the same length as the input signal ws 800 and therefore with the same temporal resolution its number of channels is nb classes where each channel indicates the probability of each behaviour 2 3 training process the training process consists in adjusting the filter weights w of each convolution of the network in order to obtain the most accurate predictions to do this we train the network on several batches of windows randomly drawn with the corresponded labels we use a loss function l that calculates the distance between the predicted and actual labels for each input and sum it all up to get the overall error of the batch through this function we further penalize the mistakes made on feeding to force the v net to focus on it the weights are then adjusted using the famous adam optimizer kingma and ba 2015 it is an adaptive version of the classical gradient descent w w l r d l d w where w represents the weights d l d w is the gradient of l and l r is positive hyper parameter called the learning rate the latter as well as the batch size batch size are determined during the tuning process see section 2 4 section 2 6 a high lr would reduce the computation time to minimize the loss but too high a value could induce too large weight updates with the result that the optimal point will be missed moreover to avoid overlearning we add the well known spatial dropout after each double convolutions with a rate of 0 5 this training process requires that the labels are balanced in the data batches however this is rarely the case in ecology where some minority behaviours could be relevant such as the feeding behaviours for sea turtles to deal with this we bias the random draw in order to increase the representativeness of the rare behaviours 20 of the windows for each batch are randomly selected from randomly chosen turtles while the remaining 80 are chosen with biased dice in further detail a window is drawn as follows a behaviour b is selected according to an assigned probability 0 25 for the minority behaviours e g feeding gliding and scratching 0 05 for the majority behaviours e g swimming and resting and 0 15 for breathing a turtle t is randomly selected with a probability proportional to its b expression the window is drawn according to a probability distribution determined from the expression of b by t fig 3 illustrates this idea each blue rectangle corresponds to the occurrence of b here b feeding and t individual 6 the orange signal represents the probability density obtained by smoothing the blue rectangles through a convolution we show in red lines all the potential windows for which the centre can be drawn according to this probability density they are vertically distributed for easier viewing as an example fig 4 shows a possible behavioural distribution obtained over 2000 windows from the biased random draw 20 randomly and 80 biased compared to the unbiased one 2 4 tuning and training processes performed simultaneously we randomly split the 13 sea turtles into three distinct groups seven individuals are used to train the network three are assigned to the validation dataset and used to adjust the hyper parameters tuning process three turtles are kept to test the method at the very end of the process training and tuning processes are performed simultaneously through 150 epochs an epoch corresponds to one pass through the training dataset where 15 000 windows are drawn to feed the optimizer by batch of 200 batch size 200 at the end of each epoch we observe the loss relative to 3000 windows of the validation dataset separate from the training dataset over the 150 epochs we finally keep the weights corresponding to the lowest validation loss the hyper parameters are tuned in order to best reduce this validation loss the main ones are the depth which corresponds to the number of created features depth 32 the learning rate lr regulating the speed of the gradient descent lr 0 01 the batch size and the sampling probabilities of behaviours 2 5 validation of the model once our model is tuned and trained we predict the behaviours of the three remaining individuals which have never been exploited previously their entire sequence is cut into successive windows with a 10 overlap on the right and left because the predictions are degraded on the edges due to the zero padding of the convolutions we run the trained model on all windows and re paste the predictions together the accuracy of the model is evaluated using the roc auc score fawcett 2006 in order to take into account the unbalanced distribution of classes we apply the multi class generalization of the auc developed by hand and till 2001 a u c t o t a l 2 c c 1 c i c j c a u c c i c j where c is the set of classes c its cardinal auc ci cj the area under the two class roc curve for classes i and j calculated over all pairs of classes and c c 1 2 the number of pairs we also compare the predictions of the model to the true behaviours through an overall confusion matrix thus the well identified behaviours tp true positive tn true negative and the misclassified windows fn false negative fp false positive are identified and used to calculate the classical indicators for each behaviour powers 2011 r e c a l l t p t p f n p r e c i s i o n t p t p f p in order to compare the ability of the network to

v net performance according to the measuring device we test the v net on three combinations of the measuring devices case i accelerometer gyroscope and depth recorder nb desc 7 case ii accelerometer and depth recorder nb desc 4 case iii gyroscope and depth recorder nb desc 4 in each case we run the algorithm on the raw data for which the descriptors are standardized one by one and for one turtle at a time as the case ii gives lower global accuracy in particular in the feeding identification and that the scientist community has mainly deployed accelerometers with depth recorders on marine animals without gyroscopes we go further in the pre processing of the acceleration data to improve the predictions we calculate the static and dynamic acceleration for the three axes and the dynamic body acceleration dba as described in jeantet et al 2020a in a similar way we attempt to highlight some feeding signal characteristics by filtering the raw acceleration through a pass band butterworth filter at 2 and 3 hz frequency thus we obtain a supplementary case case iv static dynamic and filtered acceleration dba and depth values nb desc 11 2 7 variable importance we attempt for each case case i ii iii and iv to identify the most important input variables in the classification process i e those containing the most information and mostly used by the v net we adapt the class activation map cam visualization chollet 2018 selvaraju et al 2019 developed in image classification from deep learning from the tested dataset we compute the gradients of the model s predictions for one given behaviour to the input features and average their absolute value we obtain thus the contribution of each single input variable on the classification of one specific behaviour moreover we also perform a variable selection by backward elimination to identify the impact of each variable on the classification accuracy derksen and keselman 1992 heinze et al 2018 thus we apply the v net on the tested dataset from which variables are subsequently eliminated one at a time at each time we eliminate the variable that have the lower impact on the auc by replacing it with the constant value of its mean 3 results 3 1 behavioural classification by the v net the adapted v net model discriminates the six behavioural categories breathing feeding gliding resting scratching and swimming of the free ranging green turtles from a combined accelerometer gyroscope and depth recorder with an auc score of 88 1 case i table 1 although deep learning models usually have a large number of parameters our model is relatively light 1259 335 parameters due to its fully convolutional structure and to the data in one dimension the v net demonstrates good capabilities to detect the rare behaviour of feeding with a respectable recall index and a high precision score with only 13 of the feeding dots misinterpreted as resting case i table 1 fig 5 scratching which is the least expressed behaviour shows the lowest indices 0 68 and 0 69 for the recall and precision index respectively table 1 with a model that tends to overestimate this behaviour fig 6 although the combined use of the gyroscope and accelerometer gives the best accuracy the v net successfully classifies the behaviours of the green turtles from the gyroscope alone auc 87 3 case iii table 1 in case iii the rare behaviours feeding and scratching are better detected than in case i but also associated with a slight increase in overestimation however from the accelerometer alone case ii the v net only identifies 2 of the feeding dots suggesting that the subtle variations generated by the feeding movements are easier detectable from the gyroscope than the accelerometer nevertheless a pre processing of the acceleration data enables the v net to predict with an accuracy comparable to case i and iii table 1 with 62 of the feeding dots correctly identified and 20 misclassified as resting fig 2 in supplementary materials the chewing behaviour represents 74 of those feeding dots wrongly identified as resting the backward elimination process allows us to identify the most important variables for the v net in the classification of the green turtle behaviours it clearly appears that the y axis of the gyroscope corresponding to the angular velocity around the right to left axis and thus related to movements on the rear to front axis is the most informative variable figs 7 and 8 the v net is even capable of classifying behaviours with an auc score of 72 2 with the y gyroscope alone however in absence of gyroscope case ii the three accelerometer axes as well as the depth are used equally by the v net fig 8 but are not sufficient to identify feeding table 1 from the pre processed acceleration data case iv the variables associated with the dynamic acceleration and therefore motion dynamic body acceleration dba and the dynamic acceleration on the rear to front axis dx have the highest important gradient fig 8 the filtered acceleration data between 2 and 3 hz on the rear to front axis accx high is also particularly used by the v net to classify feeding and to dissociate it from resting fig 3 in supplementary materials the backward elimination process applied to case iv shows that removing accx high results in a drop in the feeding recall index only 6 of the feeding dots are identified 3 2 sensitivity and uncertainty analyses deep learning are known to be very sensitive to small perturbation shu and zhu 2019 we test the sensitivity of the v net by classifying sea turtle behaviours from degraded data we randomly select 500 windows window size 40 s from the tested dataset in case i and gradually add some noise on each input variable for each time t i x t i x t i σ n t i where nt i are standard gaussian random variables and σ is a constant that we increase from 0 to 0 5 we perform the auc score on the obtained classification and visualisation its evolution according to the noise level fig 9 in this way by inducing a σ value of 0 05 corresponding to add 5 of noise to the inputs as they are also standardized we impact the auc by 5 auc score 80 49 against 85 67 without noise however above 10 of noise the performance of the v net drops we measure the uncertainty of the model using monte carlo dropout method abdar et al 2020 gal and ghahramani 2016 this method consists in predicting a single window multiple times n 1000 but with dropout layers activated in the prediction process forcing the v net to masque some connections the variance of the predicted probabilities indicates the uncertainty of the model fig 10 shows the obtained variance for two windows from the tested dataset in case i where the v net misclassifies feeding as scratching and at the opposite successfully identifies it it appears that most of the time the correct predictions are associated with low uncertainty while the variance increases for the misclassified parts thus the variance can help to estimate the robustness of the predictions because the v net is not too confident when it misclassifies 4 discussion the v net is a powerful fully convolutional neural network developed for the segmentation of 3d images milletari et al 2016 the proposed architecture adapted to multi sensor signals also proves to be very efficient in classifying sea turtle behaviours identifying the six behavioural categories breathing feeding gliding resting scratching and swimming we obtain an auc score of 88 1 with a global accuracy of 0 98 it represents significant improvement compared to methods based on classification trees for the same species global accuracy of 0 87 from captive individuals in jeantet et al 2018 and 0 95 from the same dataset in jeantet et al 2020a 4 1 advances in automatic behavioural classification using deep learning the v net improves the automatic animal behavioural classification from multi sensor datasets by avoiding the segmentation problem classical machine learning requires cutting the dataset into segments from which statistics maximum mean minimum standard deviation etc are calculated and used to feed the model it is a particularly difficult processing step as it has to be automatic in the real application conditions i e without knowing the beginning and ending of the behavioural labels and impacts the performance of the algorithms to date the most common segmentation method has been the windowing approach based on fixed time segments lagarde et al 2008 martiskainen et al 2009 watanabe et al 2005 or a sliding window with a fixed length ladds et al 2017 lush et al 2018a quite quickly the size of the window impacts the accuracy of the models in that some behaviours are better characterized than others allik et al 2019 banos et al 2014 lush et al 2018b other methods such as change point algorithms killick et al 2012 or hierarchical segmentation jeantet et al 2020a can also be used to overcome the limits generated by the fixed size windowing approach however these methods require ruling parameters based on the most characteristic variations between behaviours that are generally not suitable for all the behaviours also in general the segmentation process generates segments that contain the expression of several behaviours and induces confusion in the learning process of the algorithms thus all these methodological limitations induced by the segmentation process which reduce the accuracy of the prediction no longer apply to the v net given that it makes predictions with a precision down to the centisecond assigning a behaviour to each time point of the recorded values it is still difficult to identify signals that are not clearly distinct in classical machine learning bom et al 2014 fehlmann et al 2017 wang et al 2015 one possible cause could be the selected hand made features on which they rely there are multiple ways to digitally describe multi sensor signals without consensus on the best practise thus we can find studies where several thousand features were calculated compared to roughly fifty in other studies figo et al 2010 graf et al 2015 zdravevski et al 2017 given that having too many features can impair the performance of the algorithms the current solution to deal with difficult classification tasks is to calculate a large number of features and to select the most highly informative combination using a complex optimizer allik et al 2019 mirjalili 2015 all in all this adds a selection process that makes the model more complex and computationally expensive with a questionable gain in performance conversely the performance of the v net lies on a form of its own intelligence as it detects highly discriminative features by itself through the deep layers the analysis through these different layers increases the level of abstraction of the produced features and makes the v net able to detect information that goes beyond the human knowledge domain milletari et al 2016 it enables the model to extract information that could not be identified through the handcrafted features and thus makes it very powerful for detecting fine scale behaviours such as feeding and scratching the v net is thus a very powerful tool that currently outperforms classical machine learning however we show in this study that handcrafted features can also help the v net to identify the behaviours of sea turtles from acceleration data the v net is not able to identify feeding from the raw acceleration data because the oscillations recorded by a logger on the carapace are very small and subtle figs 1 and 2 in supplementary materials the visualisation of the data and the identification of discriminating characteristics of feeding have allowed us to orientate the v net in its automatic feature detection by feeding it with pre processed data carefully chosen to discriminate feeding the filtered acceleration between 2 and 3 hz we make the v net capable of identifying this behaviour from the acceleration data alone this compromise between deep learning and hand made features allows us to take advantage of the automatic discrimination ability of the neural network and to not compute a large number of handcrafted features while maintaining a simple deep learning architecture although the deep learning is increasingly powerful and used in many field human expertise is still relevant to perform automatic behavioural identification from accelerometer 4 2 improve the ecological knowledge in this study we test the relevance of adding a gyroscope to an accelerometer in automatic identification of sea turtle behaviour so far the gyroscope has been mainly used in addition to an accelerometer and magnetometer to improve the estimation of the static and dynamic acceleration fourati et al 2011 noda et al 2012 and it has been poorly exploited in automatic behavioural identification while its high sensitivity enables to measure fine and or fast angular rotation that cannot be detected from the linear acceleration clark 2009 noda et al 2014 wilson et al 2013 in this study we show that the v net mainly uses the gyroscope variables to identity the sea turtle behaviours in particular the angular velocity around the right to left axis fig 8 and it is less performant without gyroscope this is due to the fact that the sea turtle s posture is not very informative and the behaviours differ from one another mainly by the associated oscillations of the rear to front body axis however the gyroscope does not provide information about change in posture and its use alone may therefore not be sufficient for other animal species for which postures characterize their behaviours shepard et al 2008 watanabe et al 2005 we highlight that identification of the sea turtle behaviours with an accelerometer alone is also possible but requires an upstream fine analyse and good understanding of the signals in this way it is relevant to ask for each situation if the combined used of gyroscope and accelerometer is necessary as it requires more memory and larger battery capacity and thus a larger logger while the scientist community tends to study increasingly smaller species portugal and white 2018 increasing sensor possibilities should come with an ethical concern to match the most appropriate tag design to ensure the animal welfare while answering the biological question williams et al 2019 besides as the relevance of the measuring device used mainly depends on the behavioural characteristics of the studied species this should be considered and tested in each case we particularly focus on the identification of the scarce behaviours of sea turtle feeding and scratching as they have both a high ecological interest studying the feeding behaviours of free ranging animals is crucial to better understand their energetic tactics and how they maximize their fitness according to their environment although scratching has been rarely reported in sea turtle behavioural research using animal borne video recorder arthur et al 2007 okuyama et al 2013 reina et al 2005 seminoff et al 2006 it seems to have an important physiology role as it could be associated with a cleaning function heithaus et al 2002 thomson and heithaus 2014 however in general behaviours with a small number of observations available and associated with fine scale signals such as feeding and scratching are hard to detect by an automatic method jeantet et al 2018 wang et al 2015 the v net has been thought to deal with strong imbalance dataset and or limited in the number of labelled data milletari et al 2016 hence enhanced by an adapted loss function and a biased random drawn for the training process the convolutional neural network precisely detects both behaviours and slightly overestimates scratching whereas classical learning algorithms have still been poorly efficient to identify complex signals in other animal species bom et al 2014 ladds et al 2018 wang et al 2015 the v net position itself as an alternative to discriminate the fine scaled behaviours easily generalizable to other species the v net could lead to considerable progress in remote accelerometric monitoring by allowing the identification of very fine behaviours that could play an important role in understanding the ecology of the species finally the obtained model is light with only roughly one million parameters it makes it very easy to transfer a trained v net and to run it from one machine to another thus with the development of the satellite relay data tags which are already able to remotely transmit a summary of the tri axial acceleration cox et al 2017 harcourt et al 2019 heerah et al 2019 and environmental data treasure et al 2017 there is a huge potential to directly implement a trained v net in an animal attached multi sensor tag in order to predict the expressed behaviour almost instantly researchers would be able to directly follow the activities of an animal in real time with respect to its location and the environmental parameters as it would not require recapturing the animal this breakthrough would open up new horizons in the study of migratory animals that are difficult to track during several consecutive months or years 5 conclusion deep learning is an emerging field that is particularly powerful for automatically processing large datasets and the information they contain it is therefore not surprising to see its application extended to ecology by the automatic behavioural identification from multi sensor recorders an adapted fully convolutional neural network the v net reveals high ability to automatically identify the behaviours of sea turtles from multi sensor signals and outperforms classical machine learning its use is particularly interesting to avoid the segmentation process and the manual calculation of a large number of discriminant features required until now to identify the behaviours from accelerometer we also show in this study that the gyroscope is more informative that the accelerometer in identifying the behaviours of sea turtles and that the v net is not able to discriminate fine scale behaviours from the raw data of accelerometer alone however human expertise can help to correct it with precise and adapted pre processing there is great interest in developing deep learning for automatic identification of behaviours in ecology as it does not require significant pre processing of data and could be directly implemented in the logger to identify and transmit the expressed behaviour by the equipped animal almost instantly data accessibility statement data available from the dryad digital repository https doi org 10 5061 dryad hhmgqnkd9 jeantet et al 2020b

24625,animal attached accelerometers have been widely used to monitor species that are difficult to observe alongside the use of machine learning to identify behaviours from the obtained sequences artificial neural networks are powerful supervised learning algorithms that are based on deep learning and have been poorly exploited in movement ecology recently the availability of sophisticated algorithmic architectures via open source libraries facilitates their use in this study we adapt a fully convolutional neural network that was originally developed for biomedical 3d image segmentation the v net we test it on a labelled dataset collected from animal borne video recorders combined with multi sensors accelerometers gyroscopes and depth recorders deployed on free ranging immature green turtles chelonia mydas the proposed model fitted for 1d data is able to predict six behavioural categories for green turtles with an auc score of 88 it shows a high ability to detect rare behaviours with low discriminative signals such as feeding and scratching with a precision down to one centisecond the v net circumvents the segmentation process we also show that the gyroscope is more informative than the accelerometer in identifying sea turtle behaviours and that the v net is not able to discriminate feeding from the raw data of accelerometer alone however human expertise can help to correct it with precise and adapted pre processing thus diverted from its initial purpose and tested on sea turtle the v net is a very efficient method of behavioural identification that should be easily generalized to a wide range of species it could lead to considerable progress in remote accelerometric monitoring and help to understand the ecology of the species that are difficult to observe furthermore as the model is light there is also a huge potential to implement a trained v net in satellite relay data tag to remotely predict the expressed behaviours almost instantly keywords deep learning accelerometer sea turtle ecology behavioural classification convolutional neural network 1 introduction machine learning has been widely used in behavioural studies to face the new challenges related to the development of animal attached sensors valletta et al 2017 wilson et al 2018 this technology allows scientists to remotely record a large amount of data on free ranging animals for which direct observations are impracticable boyd et al 2004 brown et al 2013 their use grew rapidly in the 1990s with the development of microprocessors and the increase in memory capacity but is now limited by the difficulties in processing the complexity and volume of the recorded data ropert coudert et al 2010 wilson et al 2018 in this context machine learning has showed up as a powerful tool to handle large datasets and automatically analyse multi sensor data an emerging field requiring machine learning is the automatic behavioural identification from accelerometer the accelerometer records the fine scale movements and body posture of the equipped animals from which behaviours can be identified brown et al 2013 it is possible to label the acceleration signals with the animal behaviours through a first validation step using visual observations then the labelled dataset is used to teach a supervised learning algorithm to automatically identify the behaviours from the acceleration sequences jeantet et al 2020a 2018 nathan et al 2012 shepard et al 2008 the best known supervised learning algorithms used for behavioural identification have mainly been based on decision trees cart random forest or extreme gradient boosting brewster et al 2018 graf et al 2015 linear hyperplane separation theorem support vector machine campbell et al 2013 martiskainen et al 2009 or even the minimum distance between the unknown instance and the training data k nearest neighbors bidder et al 2014 the advantages of these algorithms are that they are easy to implement thanks to the development of free computing libraries based on r and python programming languages and they produce a good outcome without requiring advanced skills however their effectiveness is still limited in identifying fine behaviours and they do not consider the temporal dimension of the data as they process data in independent segments artificial neural networks are other powerful learning algorithms these networks are computational models that translate an input signal through successive layers where linear and non linear transformation are performed into an output layer expressing the contained information neural networks are thus able to automatically detect by themselves very complex and highly discriminating features and patterns in the data chollet 2018 such models have won numerous contests in machine learning and constitute a large part of artificial intelligence they are quite flexible and can be used to analyse images sound texts and temporal series as multi sensor recording so far deep learning has been poorly exploited in automatic behavioural identification due to its complexity we can find fully connected neural networks which correspond to the most basic form of neural network but mainly in studies comparing the performance of machine learning in automatic animal behaviour classification ladds et al 2016 nathan et al 2012 resheff et al 2014 however machine learning experts have recently provided the architecture for increasingly sophisticated and efficient neural networks via open source libraries such as tensorflow by google or pytorch by facebook for example taking this opportunity and in order to automatically identify behaviour from multi sensor records we propose in this study to test a neural network that was originally developed for biomedical 3d image segmentation the v net milletari et al 2016 its good performances on pattern recognition are all the more interesting given that it required few training images despite a highly imbalanced dataset and it performed faster than other methods contrary to classical learning algorithms and fully connected neural networks the v net takes the temporal structure of the data into account as it integrates the notion of neighbourhood we present here an adaptive version of the v net for the multi sensor time series i e 1d signals to automatically identify the behaviours of green turtle chelonia mydas green turtles are long distance migrants with high diving abilities chambault et al 2015 lutz and bentley 1985 spotila 2004 which make impossible long term observation of their at sea behaviours in order to improve conservation measures for this threatened species classified as endangered species by the international union for conservation of nature seminoff 2004 it is essential to better know their behaviours and ecology in this study we focus particularly on immature green turtles residing on the coastal foraging grounds of martinique the population shows high fidelity to this developmental habitat where they spend many years foraging to grow before undertaking migration at the sexual maturity chambault et al 2018 siegwalt et al 2020 during immature stage green turtles are mostly grazing herbivores and mainly feed on seagrass and algae bjorndal et al 2000 howell 2012 while studying feeding behaviours of green turtles is particularly important to understand their ecology it is still difficult to identify it automatically from a sensor placed on the carapace in the attempt to automatically identify the at sea behaviours of green turtle with a particular focus on the feeding events we test the performance of the v net to classify their behaviours from multi sensor recordings we use a labelled dataset collected from animal borne video recorders combined with multi sensor recorders accelerometer gyroscope and time depth recorder deployed on free ranging immature green turtles in martinique jeantet et al 2020b the outcome of the v net could be compared to a method based on classical learning algorithms such as rf egb cart and svm developed from the same dataset in a previous study jeantet et al 2020a furthermore the use of the gyroscope is not so common in behavioural identification in ecology therefore we compare the performance of the v net according to the measuring device i e the gyroscope associated with the accelerometer the gyroscope alone or the accelerometer alone 2 materials and methods 2 1 dataset description and behavioural labelling the used dataset contains the tri axial acceleration and angular velocity of 13 free ranging green turtles recorded at a frequency of either 20 hz or 50 hz jeantet et al 2020b 2020a the depth profiles are also provided at 1 hz the devices were combined with a video recorder allowing us to validate the signals the video footage analysed using a handmade software written in python language hadetskyi 2019 enables the identification of 46 different behaviours regrouped into six categories breathing feeding gliding resting scratching and swimming see jeantet et al 2020a for the behavioural definitions all other behaviours that cannot be considered into these six categories are grouped into the other category the precise description of the dataset is provided in jeantet et al 2020a as well as the corresponding r script to visualize the labelled data through the rblt package fig 1 geiger 2019 to test the v net we synchronize the observed behavioural categories with the acceleration angular velocity and depth data subsample the 50 hz data at 20 hz and remove the unlabelled section we focus in particular on the feeding category which is particular difficult to discriminate in this study the green turtles mainly fed seagrass on the ground from which we identified two distinct behaviours the action of pulling on the seagrass that we referred as grabbing and the action of mastication referred as chewing the device being on their carapace those behaviours resulted in subtle variations hardly detectable fig 1 and supplementary materials thus in order to identify the feeding category we add specific adaptations to the v net 2 2 v net architecture the v net was first described and developed by milletari et al 2016 to treat medical images 3d signals it is an evolution of the u net developed for biomedical 2d images ronneberger et al 2015 the implementation of the both algorithms can be found in the respective articles milletari et al 2016 ronneberger et al 2015 in this work we present an adapted architecture for the v net which fits with our multi sensor data i e 1d temporal series fig 2 it has been implemented with the keras and tensorflow libraries through their python interface the v net is a fully convolutional neural network meaning that it is based only on a successive sequence of convolutions it consists of two parts an encoder path that compresses the signal and creates multiple features thus performing a multiscale analysis and a decoder path that synthesizes the created features to predict the output which in our case is the behaviours the breakdown of each step of the v net is as follows input 1 this corresponds to a sequence of multi sensor data containing all the descriptors the three acceleration axes the three gyroscope axes and the depth for example nb desc 7 over a window size fixed at 40 s ws 800 for sampling data at 20 hz initialization 2 we first perform two 1d convolutions with a kernel size of 5 each followed by a relu activation in this step we conserve the size of the window by adding a border of zero and increase the number of channels from nb desc to depth the latter is a parameter tuned to 32 during the tuning process see section 2 4 section 2 6 descending part encoder 3 the output feature maps are first down sampled by averaging a convolution of size 2 and stride 2 by doing this the importance of the location of the highlighted features is reduced then we perform two convolutions of size 5 followed by relu activations the output of the convolutions is actually added to the input signal of the corresponded level and is thus seen as additive modifications of the main stream this operation also called shortcut is represented by the dotted arrows on fig 2 it has been shown that it accelerates the training process and limits gradient vanishing or explosion problems see section 2 3 section 2 5 he et al 2016 we obtain some feature maps with a window size divided by 2 and the number of channels multiplied by 2 this sequence is repeated three times ascending part decoder 4 this works as a mirror of the descending part each transformation simultaneously increases the size of the window and decreases the number of channels by a factor of 2 technically we up sample the data using a transposed convolution dumoulin and visin 2016 of size 2 followed by two convolutions of size 5 with relu activations horizontal arrows 5 at each level of the ascending part the feature maps obtained in the ascents are combined with the features created by the descents using a summation final convolutions and softmax activation 6 we perform a convolution of size 1 to obtain a dimension corresponding to the number of possible predicted behaviours nb classes 8 then a softmax function normalizes the last layer to produce probabilities output 7 we obtain a window of the same length as the input signal ws 800 and therefore with the same temporal resolution its number of channels is nb classes where each channel indicates the probability of each behaviour 2 3 training process the training process consists in adjusting the filter weights w of each convolution of the network in order to obtain the most accurate predictions to do this we train the network on several batches of windows randomly drawn with the corresponded labels we use a loss function l that calculates the distance between the predicted and actual labels for each input and sum it all up to get the overall error of the batch through this function we further penalize the mistakes made on feeding to force the v net to focus on it the weights are then adjusted using the famous adam optimizer kingma and ba 2015 it is an adaptive version of the classical gradient descent w w l r d l d w where w represents the weights d l d w is the gradient of l and l r is positive hyper parameter called the learning rate the latter as well as the batch size batch size are determined during the tuning process see section 2 4 section 2 6 a high lr would reduce the computation time to minimize the loss but too high a value could induce too large weight updates with the result that the optimal point will be missed moreover to avoid overlearning we add the well known spatial dropout after each double convolutions with a rate of 0 5 this training process requires that the labels are balanced in the data batches however this is rarely the case in ecology where some minority behaviours could be relevant such as the feeding behaviours for sea turtles to deal with this we bias the random draw in order to increase the representativeness of the rare behaviours 20 of the windows for each batch are randomly selected from randomly chosen turtles while the remaining 80 are chosen with biased dice in further detail a window is drawn as follows a behaviour b is selected according to an assigned probability 0 25 for the minority behaviours e g feeding gliding and scratching 0 05 for the majority behaviours e g swimming and resting and 0 15 for breathing a turtle t is randomly selected with a probability proportional to its b expression the window is drawn according to a probability distribution determined from the expression of b by t fig 3 illustrates this idea each blue rectangle corresponds to the occurrence of b here b feeding and t individual 6 the orange signal represents the probability density obtained by smoothing the blue rectangles through a convolution we show in red lines all the potential windows for which the centre can be drawn according to this probability density they are vertically distributed for easier viewing as an example fig 4 shows a possible behavioural distribution obtained over 2000 windows from the biased random draw 20 randomly and 80 biased compared to the unbiased one 2 4 tuning and training processes performed simultaneously we randomly split the 13 sea turtles into three distinct groups seven individuals are used to train the network three are assigned to the validation dataset and used to adjust the hyper parameters tuning process three turtles are kept to test the method at the very end of the process training and tuning processes are performed simultaneously through 150 epochs an epoch corresponds to one pass through the training dataset where 15 000 windows are drawn to feed the optimizer by batch of 200 batch size 200 at the end of each epoch we observe the loss relative to 3000 windows of the validation dataset separate from the training dataset over the 150 epochs we finally keep the weights corresponding to the lowest validation loss the hyper parameters are tuned in order to best reduce this validation loss the main ones are the depth which corresponds to the number of created features depth 32 the learning rate lr regulating the speed of the gradient descent lr 0 01 the batch size and the sampling probabilities of behaviours 2 5 validation of the model once our model is tuned and trained we predict the behaviours of the three remaining individuals which have never been exploited previously their entire sequence is cut into successive windows with a 10 overlap on the right and left because the predictions are degraded on the edges due to the zero padding of the convolutions we run the trained model on all windows and re paste the predictions together the accuracy of the model is evaluated using the roc auc score fawcett 2006 in order to take into account the unbalanced distribution of classes we apply the multi class generalization of the auc developed by hand and till 2001 a u c t o t a l 2 c c 1 c i c j c a u c c i c j where c is the set of classes c its cardinal auc ci cj the area under the two class roc curve for classes i and j calculated over all pairs of classes and c c 1 2 the number of pairs we also compare the predictions of the model to the true behaviours through an overall confusion matrix thus the well identified behaviours tp true positive tn true negative and the misclassified windows fn false negative fp false positive are identified and used to calculate the classical indicators for each behaviour powers 2011 r e c a l l t p t p f n p r e c i s i o n t p t p f p in order to compare the ability of the network to

v net performance according to the measuring device we test the v net on three combinations of the measuring devices case i accelerometer gyroscope and depth recorder nb desc 7 case ii accelerometer and depth recorder nb desc 4 case iii gyroscope and depth recorder nb desc 4 in each case we run the algorithm on the raw data for which the descriptors are standardized one by one and for one turtle at a time as the case ii gives lower global accuracy in particular in the feeding identification and that the scientist community has mainly deployed accelerometers with depth recorders on marine animals without gyroscopes we go further in the pre processing of the acceleration data to improve the predictions we calculate the static and dynamic acceleration for the three axes and the dynamic body acceleration dba as described in jeantet et al 2020a in a similar way we attempt to highlight some feeding signal characteristics by filtering the raw acceleration through a pass band butterworth filter at 2 and 3 hz frequency thus we obtain a supplementary case case iv static dynamic and filtered acceleration dba and depth values nb desc 11 2 7 variable importance we attempt for each case case i ii iii and iv to identify the most important input variables in the classification process i e those containing the most information and mostly used by the v net we adapt the class activation map cam visualization chollet 2018 selvaraju et al 2019 developed in image classification from deep learning from the tested dataset we compute the gradients of the model s predictions for one given behaviour to the input features and average their absolute value we obtain thus the contribution of each single input variable on the classification of one specific behaviour moreover we also perform a variable selection by backward elimination to identify the impact of each variable on the classification accuracy derksen and keselman 1992 heinze et al 2018 thus we apply the v net on the tested dataset from which variables are subsequently eliminated one at a time at each time we eliminate the variable that have the lower impact on the auc by replacing it with the constant value of its mean 3 results 3 1 behavioural classification by the v net the adapted v net model discriminates the six behavioural categories breathing feeding gliding resting scratching and swimming of the free ranging green turtles from a combined accelerometer gyroscope and depth recorder with an auc score of 88 1 case i table 1 although deep learning models usually have a large number of parameters our model is relatively light 1259 335 parameters due to its fully convolutional structure and to the data in one dimension the v net demonstrates good capabilities to detect the rare behaviour of feeding with a respectable recall index and a high precision score with only 13 of the feeding dots misinterpreted as resting case i table 1 fig 5 scratching which is the least expressed behaviour shows the lowest indices 0 68 and 0 69 for the recall and precision index respectively table 1 with a model that tends to overestimate this behaviour fig 6 although the combined use of the gyroscope and accelerometer gives the best accuracy the v net successfully classifies the behaviours of the green turtles from the gyroscope alone auc 87 3 case iii table 1 in case iii the rare behaviours feeding and scratching are better detected than in case i but also associated with a slight increase in overestimation however from the accelerometer alone case ii the v net only identifies 2 of the feeding dots suggesting that the subtle variations generated by the feeding movements are easier detectable from the gyroscope than the accelerometer nevertheless a pre processing of the acceleration data enables the v net to predict with an accuracy comparable to case i and iii table 1 with 62 of the feeding dots correctly identified and 20 misclassified as resting fig 2 in supplementary materials the chewing behaviour represents 74 of those feeding dots wrongly identified as resting the backward elimination process allows us to identify the most important variables for the v net in the classification of the green turtle behaviours it clearly appears that the y axis of the gyroscope corresponding to the angular velocity around the right to left axis and thus related to movements on the rear to front axis is the most informative variable figs 7 and 8 the v net is even capable of classifying behaviours with an auc score of 72 2 with the y gyroscope alone however in absence of gyroscope case ii the three accelerometer axes as well as the depth are used equally by the v net fig 8 but are not sufficient to identify feeding table 1 from the pre processed acceleration data case iv the variables associated with the dynamic acceleration and therefore motion dynamic body acceleration dba and the dynamic acceleration on the rear to front axis dx have the highest important gradient fig 8 the filtered acceleration data between 2 and 3 hz on the rear to front axis accx high is also particularly used by the v net to classify feeding and to dissociate it from resting fig 3 in supplementary materials the backward elimination process applied to case iv shows that removing accx high results in a drop in the feeding recall index only 6 of the feeding dots are identified 3 2 sensitivity and uncertainty analyses deep learning are known to be very sensitive to small perturbation shu and zhu 2019 we test the sensitivity of the v net by classifying sea turtle behaviours from degraded data we randomly select 500 windows window size 40 s from the tested dataset in case i and gradually add some noise on each input variable for each time t i x t i x t i σ n t i where nt i are standard gaussian random variables and σ is a constant that we increase from 0 to 0 5 we perform the auc score on the obtained classification and visualisation its evolution according to the noise level fig 9 in this way by inducing a σ value of 0 05 corresponding to add 5 of noise to the inputs as they are also standardized we impact the auc by 5 auc score 80 49 against 85 67 without noise however above 10 of noise the performance of the v net drops we measure the uncertainty of the model using monte carlo dropout method abdar et al 2020 gal and ghahramani 2016 this method consists in predicting a single window multiple times n 1000 but with dropout layers activated in the prediction process forcing the v net to masque some connections the variance of the predicted probabilities indicates the uncertainty of the model fig 10 shows the obtained variance for two windows from the tested dataset in case i where the v net misclassifies feeding as scratching and at the opposite successfully identifies it it appears that most of the time the correct predictions are associated with low uncertainty while the variance increases for the misclassified parts thus the variance can help to estimate the robustness of the predictions because the v net is not too confident when it misclassifies 4 discussion the v net is a powerful fully convolutional neural network developed for the segmentation of 3d images milletari et al 2016 the proposed architecture adapted to multi sensor signals also proves to be very efficient in classifying sea turtle behaviours identifying the six behavioural categories breathing feeding gliding resting scratching and swimming we obtain an auc score of 88 1 with a global accuracy of 0 98 it represents significant improvement compared to methods based on classification trees for the same species global accuracy of 0 87 from captive individuals in jeantet et al 2018 and 0 95 from the same dataset in jeantet et al 2020a 4 1 advances in automatic behavioural classification using deep learning the v net improves the automatic animal behavioural classification from multi sensor datasets by avoiding the segmentation problem classical machine learning requires cutting the dataset into segments from which statistics maximum mean minimum standard deviation etc are calculated and used to feed the model it is a particularly difficult processing step as it has to be automatic in the real application conditions i e without knowing the beginning and ending of the behavioural labels and impacts the performance of the algorithms to date the most common segmentation method has been the windowing approach based on fixed time segments lagarde et al 2008 martiskainen et al 2009 watanabe et al 2005 or a sliding window with a fixed length ladds et al 2017 lush et al 2018a quite quickly the size of the window impacts the accuracy of the models in that some behaviours are better characterized than others allik et al 2019 banos et al 2014 lush et al 2018b other methods such as change point algorithms killick et al 2012 or hierarchical segmentation jeantet et al 2020a can also be used to overcome the limits generated by the fixed size windowing approach however these methods require ruling parameters based on the most characteristic variations between behaviours that are generally not suitable for all the behaviours also in general the segmentation process generates segments that contain the expression of several behaviours and induces confusion in the learning process of the algorithms thus all these methodological limitations induced by the segmentation process which reduce the accuracy of the prediction no longer apply to the v net given that it makes predictions with a precision down to the centisecond assigning a behaviour to each time point of the recorded values it is still difficult to identify signals that are not clearly distinct in classical machine learning bom et al 2014 fehlmann et al 2017 wang et al 2015 one possible cause could be the selected hand made features on which they rely there are multiple ways to digitally describe multi sensor signals without consensus on the best practise thus we can find studies where several thousand features were calculated compared to roughly fifty in other studies figo et al 2010 graf et al 2015 zdravevski et al 2017 given that having too many features can impair the performance of the algorithms the current solution to deal with difficult classification tasks is to calculate a large number of features and to select the most highly informative combination using a complex optimizer allik et al 2019 mirjalili 2015 all in all this adds a selection process that makes the model more complex and computationally expensive with a questionable gain in performance conversely the performance of the v net lies on a form of its own intelligence as it detects highly discriminative features by itself through the deep layers the analysis through these different layers increases the level of abstraction of the produced features and makes the v net able to detect information that goes beyond the human knowledge domain milletari et al 2016 it enables the model to extract information that could not be identified through the handcrafted features and thus makes it very powerful for detecting fine scale behaviours such as feeding and scratching the v net is thus a very powerful tool that currently outperforms classical machine learning however we show in this study that handcrafted features can also help the v net to identify the behaviours of sea turtles from acceleration data the v net is not able to identify feeding from the raw acceleration data because the oscillations recorded by a logger on the carapace are very small and subtle figs 1 and 2 in supplementary materials the visualisation of the data and the identification of discriminating characteristics of feeding have allowed us to orientate the v net in its automatic feature detection by feeding it with pre processed data carefully chosen to discriminate feeding the filtered acceleration between 2 and 3 hz we make the v net capable of identifying this behaviour from the acceleration data alone this compromise between deep learning and hand made features allows us to take advantage of the automatic discrimination ability of the neural network and to not compute a large number of handcrafted features while maintaining a simple deep learning architecture although the deep learning is increasingly powerful and used in many field human expertise is still relevant to perform automatic behavioural identification from accelerometer 4 2 improve the ecological knowledge in this study we test the relevance of adding a gyroscope to an accelerometer in automatic identification of sea turtle behaviour so far the gyroscope has been mainly used in addition to an accelerometer and magnetometer to improve the estimation of the static and dynamic acceleration fourati et al 2011 noda et al 2012 and it has been poorly exploited in automatic behavioural identification while its high sensitivity enables to measure fine and or fast angular rotation that cannot be detected from the linear acceleration clark 2009 noda et al 2014 wilson et al 2013 in this study we show that the v net mainly uses the gyroscope variables to identity the sea turtle behaviours in particular the angular velocity around the right to left axis fig 8 and it is less performant without gyroscope this is due to the fact that the sea turtle s posture is not very informative and the behaviours differ from one another mainly by the associated oscillations of the rear to front body axis however the gyroscope does not provide information about change in posture and its use alone may therefore not be sufficient for other animal species for which postures characterize their behaviours shepard et al 2008 watanabe et al 2005 we highlight that identification of the sea turtle behaviours with an accelerometer alone is also possible but requires an upstream fine analyse and good understanding of the signals in this way it is relevant to ask for each situation if the combined used of gyroscope and accelerometer is necessary as it requires more memory and larger battery capacity and thus a larger logger while the scientist community tends to study increasingly smaller species portugal and white 2018 increasing sensor possibilities should come with an ethical concern to match the most appropriate tag design to ensure the animal welfare while answering the biological question williams et al 2019 besides as the relevance of the measuring device used mainly depends on the behavioural characteristics of the studied species this should be considered and tested in each case we particularly focus on the identification of the scarce behaviours of sea turtle feeding and scratching as they have both a high ecological interest studying the feeding behaviours of free ranging animals is crucial to better understand their energetic tactics and how they maximize their fitness according to their environment although scratching has been rarely reported in sea turtle behavioural research using animal borne video recorder arthur et al 2007 okuyama et al 2013 reina et al 2005 seminoff et al 2006 it seems to have an important physiology role as it could be associated with a cleaning function heithaus et al 2002 thomson and heithaus 2014 however in general behaviours with a small number of observations available and associated with fine scale signals such as feeding and scratching are hard to detect by an automatic method jeantet et al 2018 wang et al 2015 the v net has been thought to deal with strong imbalance dataset and or limited in the number of labelled data milletari et al 2016 hence enhanced by an adapted loss function and a biased random drawn for the training process the convolutional neural network precisely detects both behaviours and slightly overestimates scratching whereas classical learning algorithms have still been poorly efficient to identify complex signals in other animal species bom et al 2014 ladds et al 2018 wang et al 2015 the v net position itself as an alternative to discriminate the fine scaled behaviours easily generalizable to other species the v net could lead to considerable progress in remote accelerometric monitoring by allowing the identification of very fine behaviours that could play an important role in understanding the ecology of the species finally the obtained model is light with only roughly one million parameters it makes it very easy to transfer a trained v net and to run it from one machine to another thus with the development of the satellite relay data tags which are already able to remotely transmit a summary of the tri axial acceleration cox et al 2017 harcourt et al 2019 heerah et al 2019 and environmental data treasure et al 2017 there is a huge potential to directly implement a trained v net in an animal attached multi sensor tag in order to predict the expressed behaviour almost instantly researchers would be able to directly follow the activities of an animal in real time with respect to its location and the environmental parameters as it would not require recapturing the animal this breakthrough would open up new horizons in the study of migratory animals that are difficult to track during several consecutive months or years 5 conclusion deep learning is an emerging field that is particularly powerful for automatically processing large datasets and the information they contain it is therefore not surprising to see its application extended to ecology by the automatic behavioural identification from multi sensor recorders an adapted fully convolutional neural network the v net reveals high ability to automatically identify the behaviours of sea turtles from multi sensor signals and outperforms classical machine learning its use is particularly interesting to avoid the segmentation process and the manual calculation of a large number of discriminant features required until now to identify the behaviours from accelerometer we also show in this study that the gyroscope is more informative that the accelerometer in identifying the behaviours of sea turtles and that the v net is not able to discriminate fine scale behaviours from the raw data of accelerometer alone however human expertise can help to correct it with precise and adapted pre processing there is great interest in developing deep learning for automatic identification of behaviours in ecology as it does not require significant pre processing of data and could be directly implemented in the logger to identify and transmit the expressed behaviour by the equipped animal almost instantly data accessibility statement data available from the dryad digital repository https doi org 10 5061 dryad hhmgqnkd9 jeantet et al 2020b

24626,the energy exascale earth system model e3sm simulates fully coupled processes and interactions among water energy carbon and nutrient cycles e3sm connects vegetation and soil dynamics through nutrient uptake plant production litterfall and decomposition as a function of abiotic parameters e g temperature and moisture however e3sm is designed to characterize terrestrial ecosystems and connects land and open ocean systems using a single streamflow transport term ignoring the complex dynamics of energy water carbon and nutrients in coastal systems the goals of our project were to 1 parameterize a point version of e3sm to capture coastal wetland habitats and 2 determine marsh community responses to increased temperature and elevated co2 we adapted a version of the e3sm land model previously configured to represent forested bog hydrology to a coastal ecosystem using datasets from field experiments conducted at the smithsonian environmental research center s global change research wetland gcrew tidal forcing in a marsh environment was simulated using a two column system in which the columns are connected by lateral hydrologic flows one column simulates interactions between vegetation and soil while a second column simulates variation in water level both tidal and sea level rise the updated model captures many aspects of the field experiments showing that plant

landward stressors protecting open ocean ecosystems barbier et al 2011 barbier 2013 finlayson et al 2005 although these habitats are highly productive and provide valuable ecosystem services coastal processes are rarely represented in earth system models esms for example the u s department of energy s energy exascale earth system model e3sm simulates many coupled processes and interactions among water energy carbon and nutrient cycles golaz et al 2019 but ignores most processes and mechanisms operating at terrestrial aquatic interfaces while the e3sm land model elm simulates vegetation and soil processes including plant production nutrient uptake litterfall and decomposition it lacks a mechanistic representation of hydrological ecological and biogeochemical processes connecting upland ecosystems to coasts golaz et al 2019 petersen et al 2019 ricciuto et al 2018 shi et al 2015 tang j and riley 2018 because coastal systems play a vital role in protecting adjacent terrestrial systems from erosion and reducing nutrient flux to the open ocean mechanistic incorporation of these ecosystems in global scale simulations is key to improving global climate projections however there are challenges to adding coastal ecosystem representation to the global scale elm coastal ecosystems in comparison to open ocean or upland terrestrial habitats are characterized by dynamic shifts within short timeframes as they respond to tidally induced diurnal changes in ph salinity oxygen exposure availability light and nutrient supply duarte et al 2008 barbier et al 2011 barbier 2013 costanza et al 1997 which makes them inherently difficult to model ganju et al 2016 ward et al 2020 fagherazzi and priestas 2010 esm frameworks often have a spatial resolution that is too low to characterize coastal dynamics peters lidard et al 2007 ward et al 2020 on a smaller scale successful models of some coastal processes have been created to simulate the hydrology geomorphology and or ecology of these systems but these models often focus on mechanistic representation of a few processes and omit or use empirical representation to define non target processes van oevelen et al 2006 fennel et al 2009 heiss et al 2017 middelburg 1989 rasse et al 2003 volta et al 2014 aller 2004 anderson et al 1997 craft et al 2009 itoh et al 2018 grangere et al 2010 kirwan 2013 by focusing on a single interaction or subset of interactions model assumptions are simplified and computational requirements decreased while this approach is valid based on their spatial scales translation of these model capabilities to larger scales can be difficult since their narrow focus or site specific representations limit their ability to characterize the complexity of highly inter connected and dynamic coastal systems we investigated methods for adapting the e3sm land model elm v1 golaz et al 2019 to describe coastal wetland dynamics using a model configuration that considers processes within a single grid cell we developed new plant functional type parameterizations to mimic coastal wetland vegetation we also modified the model s treatment of sub grid heterogeneity to represent tidal flows and some aspects of lateral subsurface hydrology in coastal wetlands although we demonstrate new capabilities for elm at the level of a single grid cell these modifications can later be applied and evaluated at broader spatial scales within the e3sm framework to represent coastal vegetation and develop the necessary process representations we narrowed our focus to tidal marshes since it is a common habitat type and selected a site the global change research wetland gcrew on the western shore of chesapeake bay because of open access to long term data the gcrew data repository and associated publications provided an extensive library of information for model parameterization megonigal 2020a b we focused on two plant functional types with different photosynthetic strategies a c3 sedge schoenoplectus americanus and a c4 grass spartina patens while both plant species occur at gcrew s americanus is typically found at lower marsh elevations than s patens data from the salt marsh response to temperature experiment smartx noyce et al 2019 were used to evaluate model performance smartx evaluates the effects of elevated temperature in both c3 and c4 communities using above and belowground heating noyce et al 2019 in addition elevated co2 eco2 treatments were conducted in c3 plots to determine the interacting effects of eco2 and rising temperatures on primary production elevation changes and greenhouse gas production noyce et al 2019 accurate characterization of feedbacks among vegetation marsh elevation and hydrology as climate conditions change is important for predicting the survival or loss of tidal marshes and thereby the fate of adjacent ecosystems the effects of eco2 rietl et al 2021 ratliff et al 2015 and warming kirwan and mudd 2012 on intertidal saltmarsh vegetation have been modelled independently but the interacting effects of both stressors have not models that investigated responses of eco2 or warming in saltmarshes ratliff et al 2015 rietl et al 2021 kirwan and mudd 2012 were primarily focused on geomorphic feedbacks related to sea level rise and includes biomass production as a defined function of environmental parameters kirwan and mudd 2012 and rietl et al 2021 defined biomass as a parabolic function of elevation inundation while ratliff et al 2015 defined biomass as a linear function of co2 concentration however models that incorporate mechanistic representation of biomass production including plant phenology and physiology can be used to understand the interacting effects of eco2 warming and shifting hydrologic regimes on saltmarsh vegetation as demonstrated for simulations of other systems such as agricultural land grant et al 1998 grant et al 1999 boreal forests grant 2004 grant et al 2006 and grasslands using the model ecosys or terrestrial peatland shi et al 2021 using elm our goals in this study were to 1 modify and parameterize a point version of elm to mimic tidal marsh and 2 assess c3 and c4 marsh community responses to increased temperature and elevated co2 as investigated in the smartx project 2 methods we modified model process representations for vegetation and hydrology using data collected from gcrew most data are available through gcrew s public data repository megonigal 2020b or through manuscripts published on studies conducted at gcrew megonigal 2020a model performance was evaluated using measurements of net primary productivity npp root biomass shoot biomass and root shoot ratio responses to temperature and eco2 from the in situ smartx project for more information on the in situ smartx experiment please refer to noyce et al 2019 the cruncep atmospheric forcing data viovy 2018 was used for all simulations conducted using elm within e3sm v1 golaz et al 2019 our modified version of elm is openly available through the e3sm github repository uchicago argonne 2018 branch name omeara lnd marsh changes in hydrology and vegetation within our branch of elm are turned on using the marsh flag when running elm using the offline model testbed olmt branch name marsh ricciuto 2020 2 1 hydrology updates 2 1 1 tide simulation intertidal hydrology was mimicked using the two column system initially developed for microtopography of a northern peatland bog shi et al 2015 the original two column system represents interactions between a hummock high elevation and hollow low elevation and their connections to the local drainage system the encircling lag to adapt the hydrology to a tidal marsh the high elevation column was used to represent a marsh platform and the low elevation column was adapted to represent changing water levels in an adjacent tidal channel see graphical abstract tidal water level changes were mimicked using a sinusoidal function generated from tidal gage data 2017 2018 using the microsoft excel solver function the tidal height function h t was generated by determining the lowest sum of residuals between a sine function and tide gage data since elm tests for water conservation within the system water budget calculations were updated to include tidal flux as an external forcing term 2 1 2 infiltration in elm ice forms on the soil surface and below the surface when temperatures reach 273 k or lower which reduces vertical water flow and affects soil saturation in saline intertidal systems salinity and water flow prevent ice formation even at temperature below 273 k therefore we lowered the freezing point of the system to 271 k to account for salinity and vertical water flow in cold conditions 2 1 3 subsurface flow while infiltration and vertical water transport have been observed at gcrew rates of horizontal subsurface water flow are negligible personal observation megonigal within elm subsurface flow was minimized by increasing the distance between the two columns for lateral flow calculations from 1 m to 50 m the increased distance decreased connectivity in the subsurface and created a lag in tidal inundation in the marsh column consistent with field observations 2 2 vegetation parameterization plant functional traits pfts within elm are defined by phenological and photosynthetic traits of the plant trait parameters in elm twenty three were definable based on plant physiological data gathered at the gcrew site table 1 for observations made as part of any experiment conducted at gcrew only ambient or control plot data were used for model parameterization given the range of physiology parameter values supported by observations and known interactions among these parameters in elm ricciuto et al 2018 we conducted an objective optimization exercise to jointly select a set of best fit parameter values realistic parameter ranges were identified using legacy data from the gcrew data repository and random combinations of realistic values were analyzed using monte carlo methods lu et al 2017 ricciuto et al 2018 implemented through the olmt five hundred simulations were run for each marsh type to identify optimal parameter values we compared elm simulated results for yearly npp aboveground npp shoot biomass leaf area index and leaf carbon stock from 1987 to 2010 with gcrew legacy data control or ambient plots only fig 1 although data through 2018 is available through the smithsonian servers we limited our timeframe to 1987 2010 to coincide with publicly available data it should be noted that npp within elm is the sum of aboveground and belowground npp and a non structural carbohydrate storage pool since marsh plant shoots dieback but belowground biomass remains roots and rhizomes combined the non structural pool was included in the belowground biomass defined as yearly npp aboveground npp model performance was assessed using two metrics 1 difference in average value from 1987 to 2010 and 2 σ measured modelled 2 calculated for each year both metrics were summed for all four benchmarks and standardized to the range between 0 and 1 lower values indicated better fit between elm simulations and gcrew data optimized values are shown in table 1 similarity between benchmark data and simulations improved with updated pft definitions but parameterization was more successful for c3 than c4 plants to improve c4 parameterization monte carlo analyses were also used to identify parameters without field data that may be important for pft parameterization table 2 the goal was to identify parameters that should be targeted for future data collection monte carlo parameter value ranges were chosen based on the highest and lowest values for all pfts currently parameterized in elm optimal value ranges were determined based on the ten most successful simulations parameters with the narrowest optimized ranges relative to the tested ranges indicated a strong shift in model fit with subtle value changes this narrow range of acceptable values was used as an indicator of sensitivity subtle changes in rooting distribution and new belowground to aboveground herein root to shoot allocation parameters produced the greatest impact on similarity metrics 2 3 simulating smartx using the optimized vegetation parameters and updated hydrological functions simulations were run using the temperature and eco2 treatments conducted in situ for the smartx project noyce et al 2019 in addition to the ambient temperature treatment three increased temperature treatments were mimicked by increasing near surface air temperature by 1 7 c 3 4 c or 5 1 c following the details of the field experiment noyce et al 2019 elevated co2 treatments were simulated using a fixed atmospheric co2 concentration of 750 ppmv smartx eco2 treatments were crossed only with the highest and lowest temperature treatments 5 1 c and ambient and only in the c3 plots the c4 plots were omitted since previous and ongoing research at the site has shown a negligible influence of eco2 on c4 biomass production drake 2014 elm simulations were conducted for all temperature and eco2 treatments for both c3 and c4 plants in a full cross response ratios and variance were calculated for eco2 effects across all temperatures for c3 gcrew and elm and c4 elm only samples using eqs 1 and 2 respectively lajeunesse 2011 hedges and olkin 1985 hedges et al 1999 1 r r ln x t x c where rr is the response ratio x t is the mean of the treatment group and x c is the mean of the control group 2 σ 2 r r s d c 2 n c x c 2 s d t 2 n t x t 2 where σ 2 r r is the sampling variance sdc and sdt are the standard deviation of the controls and treatments and nc and nt are the sample sizes for controls and treatments respectively 3 results 3 1 intertidal hydrology based on 2017 2018 data intertidal hydrology was defined as tidal height h t using the following function 3 h t 500 sin 3 e 5 π t 513 4328 2 sin 1 e 8 π t 0 9152 800 where t indicates time in seconds since january 1 1850 according to water level data c3 and c4 marshes are inundated 30 and 5 of the time respectively to account for inundation c3 elevation was set at 30 cm above the bed of the tidal channel while c4 elevation was set to 70 cm changes in freezing point resulted in ice lenses formation similar in depth and seasonal duration to ice coverage observed at gcrew fig 2 personal observation megonigal reduced ice coverage decreased vertical flow impedance allowing for more realistic soil saturation rates during the winter months in addition to improving vertical flow modifications to lateral conductivity decreased lateral flow between columns from 5 7 10 3 3 7 10 3 to 2 1 10 5 1 8 10 5 mm h2o s 1 3 2 smartx simulations overall elm results tended to overestimate production 69 9 higher than gcrew results fig 3 primarily by overestimating belowground or root production 373 43 higher than gcrew results simulation errors were generally lower for 2017 than 2018 and c4 simulations were less successful than c3 fig 3 for c3 simulations shoot production was relatively close to observed npp rates at lower temperature and diverged with higher temperature treatments for 2018 0 c 13 error 5 1 c 28 error but the opposite was true for 2017 0 c 19 error 5 1 c 13 error in 2018 root production in c3 simulations peaked with modest temperature increases 1 7 c but not in 2017 fig 3 overall simulated root production rates were higher than anticipated based on in situ observations overestimated by 283 62 modeled root shoot ratios did not follow temperature trends observed at smartx in 2017 but were similar to smartx results in 2018 with a peak at moderate temperature increases root shoot at 0 c and 1 7 c 0 95 followed by a decline with further temperature increases up to 5 1⁰c root shoot 0 74 in addition eco2 increased productivity above and belowground in elm simulations similar to results from smartx however smartx results indicated stronger belowground responses aboveground 8 6 increase belowground 142 21 increase while elm increases were similar between both above 46 17 and belowground 38 17 in 2018 eco2 increased root shoot ratio 0 c 0 09 0 06 5 1 c 0 07 0 15 similar to in situ data but in 2017 simulated root shoot ratio decreased at 5 c 0 c 0 09 0 06 5 1 c 0 07 0 15 response ratios for eco2 effects were similar in both field observations and simulations fig 4 elevated co2 increased root shoot and total biomass production in both field studies and simulations however response ratio for root shoot ratio was positive for smartx and negative for elm for c4 simulations a significant overestimation of belowground production 450 33 led to an overestimation of total production 99 50 and root shoot ratio 563 299 the simulated temperature response of shoot production in 2018 was similar to smartx results but other trends of temperature response differed significantly elm simulations for c4 plants did not show peaks in root production or root shoot ratio at 1 7 c the effects of eco2 were often minimal e g 2017 shoots biomass 10 increase but in some cases it decreased production rates e g 2018 root biomass 29 decrease since previous and ongoing work has shown negligible effects of eco2 on c4 production curtis et al 1990 response ratios were expected to approximate zero elm simulations indicated a net increase in shoot biomass due to eco2 but a decrease in root biomass leading to decrease in both total production and root shoot biomass however the overall response ratio for total production was relatively small compared to c3 simulations to identify c4 traits that would improve reparameterization another sensitivity analysis was conducted with an expanded set of traits table 2 using the expanded trait list improved similarity between c4 simulations and gcrew data fig 3 and results indicated that c4 definitions could improve with additional data on 1 c decomposition primarily sediment organic matter degradation rates and pool structure tied to c n of sediment organic matter pools and 2 soil plant hydraulic interactions e g number of drought days to initiate loss of leaves 4 discussion 4 1 point scale simulations our attempt to parameterize coastal pfts and incorporate intertidal hydrology was modestly successful in both parameter optimization and replication of smartx temperature and eco2 experiment responses to improve these initial efforts we identified parameters that could reduce error and bias with targeted data collection and determined key challenges in translating point scale models to watershed or global scale simulations this work represents the first step to developing a mechanistic representation of coastal environments in elm we were able to generate a two column system consisting of a marsh platform and tidal channel to simulate coastal wetland hydrology we reduced ice formation to account for both water flow and salinity and decreased horizontal subsurface flow to align with the reduced hydraulic conductivity in the organic rich soils at gcrew finally we were able to mimic bi directional tidal flow to simulate periodic inundation these modifications incorporated tidal flow and incorporated feedbacks between inundation and production in addition we created data structures in anticipation of coupling our modified elm model to process based hydrology and geomorphology models our vegetation parameterization generated npp estimates that were more similar to field data for aboveground biomass than belowground biomass and npp responses to eco2 and temperature were better for the c3 community than the c4 community discrepancies between elm and the smartx experimental data in belowground biomass are likely an artefact of parameterization since aboveground biomass was a primary benchmark while belowground biomass arose from total npp estimates that are subject to errors and limitations in both field methods and model structure belowground biomass is far more difficult to observe and the ingrowth core technique used at the gcrew site like many other methods for assessing belowground production has limitations for smartx ingrowth cores were mesh bags filled with root free peat buried below the surface and retrieved 12 months after deployment noyce et al 2019 belowground biomass is determined by growth found within the mesh bag after retrieval however this method can mischaracterize growth by providing a low competition space for root proliferation or creating an exclusion to larger root and rhizomes or grazing due to mesh size in addition ingrowth cores can underestimate production because they do not account for losses due to decomposition or grazing between sampling periods milchunas 2009 and have been shown to provide lower estimates of belowground biomass primarily rhizome biomass compared to soil core neill 1992 or minirhizotron data hendricks et al 2005 while ingrowth cores errors likely have little influence on comparison between treatments since underestimation would be consistent between samples absolute values used for parameterization and validation could generate errors in simulation of belowground production in addition the lack of salinity effects on vegetation growth in elm could lead to a high bias in simulated production rates because elm has a fixed carbon allocation parameter for new root not including the non structural c pool and new shoot growth and benchmark data are skewed towards characterizing aboveground production overestimates in production would more likely affect belowground than aboveground processes however despite this limitation the new model was able to capture important experimental responses observed in smartx plots for c3 communities patterns in npp and root shoot ratio in response to temperature and eco2 treatments were observed in elm simulations including a peak in root biomass under moderate warming fig 3 2018 and increases in biomass with eco2 fig 3 overall response ratios across all temperatures and years were similar in direction and magnitude between smartx and elm simulations for total biomass fig 4 indicating agreement between simulations and field data and responses were similar to previous studies percent change from control c3 average 36 range 66 181 c4 average 3 range 77 90 mckee et al 2012 cherry et al 2009 however the simulations overestimated aboveground response and underestimated belowground response which is expected based on errors in belowground biomass parameterization using ingrowth cores see previous paragraph as a result of the difference in responses in elm vs smartx eco2 decreased root shoot ratio in simulations but in situ responses indicated an increase in c4 communities eco2 had little influence on total production as anticipated but modeled peaks in npp for mild temperature increase and subsequent decline at higher temperatures were not observed in the field experiment we conducted expanded monte carlo analyses and found that simulations could be significantly improved with better parameterization of hydraulic interactions between plants and soil and a better understanding of biogeochemical decomposition processes errors associated with misrepresentation of hydraulic interactions such as soil water potential and plant water requirements are most likely linked to the lack of salinity in elm as discussed above but another issue may be the use of water saturation as a proxy for oxygen availability because plant mediated transport of oxygen occurs during inundated high tide conditions oxygen and water saturation are not directly correlated previous work at the gcrew facility suggests that plant transport of oxygen from the atmosphere into saturated anoxic soils stimulates soil organic matter decomposition rates an effect that is positively related to plant biomass and stimulated by eco2 mueller et al 2016 wolf et al 2007 our expanded parameterization indicated model sensitivity to sediment organic matter degradation rates and c n ratios of organic matter which indicates a dependence on oxygen and n availability since oxygen availability regulates redox conditions and nitrogen is known to be a limiting nutrient in coastal tidal wetlands better characterization in these key factors may improve simulations biogeochemistry in elm is limited to carbon nitrogen and phosphorus however in estuarine environments strong redox gradients an abundant supply of sulfate and fluctuations in solubility with salinity variation mean that the biogeochemistry submodel would benefit from electron acceptor donor pairs beyond carbon and nitrogen mainly iron and sulfate species we are exploring the use of a sophisticated reactive transport code pflotran as a new submodel coupled to elm to capture these dynamics lichtner et al 2019 thornton et al 2009 tang et al 2016 although the current elm decomposition representation is limited to aerobic processes the flexible nature of pflotran facilitates the incorporation of additional biogeochemical reactions needed to describe coastal systems such as salinity anaerobic redox chemistry and ph with improved biogeochemistry and plant soil hydraulic interactions our simulations of coastal environments could be significantly improved in addition work is still necessary to scale our point model simulations to a watershed or global scale 4 2 from point scale to global simulations the need for better representation of coastal processes in global models is well established itoh et al 2018 snelgrove et al 2014 most existing watershed scale models tend to focus on coastal and shallow subtidal processes ignoring intertidal processes and in many cases biological functions snelgrove et al 2014 for example the sea level affecting marshes model slamm www warrenpinnacle com prof slamm incorporates intertidal vegetation as a static boundary condition rather than as a dynamic prognostic model component in addition some watershed and regional scale models do not incorporate mechanistic biogeochemical processing or have a limited number of electron donor acceptor pairs for example biogeochemistry is explicitly outside of the scope of the chesapeake bay water quality and sediment transport model wqstm aka the chesapeake bay model cerco and noel 2017 for the same system the estuarine model rom rca testa et al 2014 brady et al 2013 incorporates biogeochemical cycling for open estuary environments but does not include intertidal habitats the lack of integration between hydrology geomorphology biogeochemistry and ecology in coastal and estuarine models especially in terrestrial aquatic interfaces is often tied to model purpose most of the available models are designed as tools for land management or pollutant fate and transport to identify total maximum daily loads therefore the focus of these models is often tied to a specific environmental parameter of concern such as the spatially referenced regression on watershed attributes sparrow schwarz et al 2006 model the wqstm chesapeake bay program 2020 or epa s water quality analysis simulation program wasp wool et al 2020 watershed models designed to focus on a specific region or subset of processes may not be suitable for connection to global scale models due to mismatched data structures in watershed vs global models it may not be possible to translate mechanistic representations to a larger scale by using elm we have circumvented many of the compatibility issues in translating from a point scale model to a global model but we have only characterized two habitat types and our current simulations do not represent dynamic vegetation shifts observed in coastal systems to increase the scale of our simulation to a watershed or larger we need improved methods for characterizing heterogeneity within the system both spatially and temporally habitat heterogeneity is important to characterize in a system where subtle differences can have important plant community implications as little as 20 cm in elevation can alter water saturation and salinity making conditions more conducive to a c3 or c4 community and the high connectivity between habitats means that spatial distribution plays an important role in defining ecosystem function habitats at the edge of the marsh reduce wave energy creating a more conducive environment for vegetation growth up shore which promotes production bilkovic et al 2017 piazza et al 2005 as marsh production increases erosion rates decrease sedimentation rates increase and vertical accretion can occur enhancing carbon sequestration davis et al 2015 mudd et al 2010 the standard resolution of elm is a 110 110 km grid cell which is not high enough to encompass habitat heterogeneity or potentially track changes in vegetation species distributions but using a flexible multi scale mesh e g model for prediction across scales mpas finite volume community ocean model fvcom we can improve resolution in coastal systems and our ability to incorporate heterogeneity although mpas has not been used specifically for an estuary it has demonstrated success using unstructured horizontal meshes for coastlines of the antarctic ice sheet petersen et al 2019 and fvcom has used an unstructured mesh to simulate estuarine hydrology chen et al 2003 clark et al 2018 however neither mpas nor fvcom incorporates intertidal plant physiology clark et al 2018 or biogeochemistry xue et al 2014 model coupling and incorporation of an unstructured mesh may resolve issues with spatial heterogeneity but temporal heterogeneity is also a concern temporal variation is high due to the migration of coastal communities in response to changing environmental conditions feedbacks between sediment plants and hydrology in tidal wetlands can cause significant shifts in community structure tidal wetland vegetation enhances vertical accretion by reducing wave energy or flow resulting in greater sediment deposition clark et al 2018 kirwan and murray 2007 as sea level rises marshes elevation is maintained through sediment accretion however accreting marshes can quickly become receding marshes due to storms accelerated sea level rise and changes in sediment supply linked to human and or macrofaunal activity kirwan 2013 kirwan and guntenspergen 2012 wilson et al 2012 as the marsh elevation changes the community structure shifts due to changes in inundation regime gedan et al 2009 bertness 1991 to properly simulate dynamic community shifts we need to parameterize vegetated coastal ecosystems other than tidal marshes such as mangroves and submerged aquatic vegetation in addition to vegetation coastal systems also rely on other organisms to create biogenic habitat shellfish reefs and beds worm beds and algal forests and mats can all create habitat defining features since elm is designed using plant functional types pfts the addition of biogenic pfts will require some restructuring to move away from phenology based habitat distinctions by incorporating both biogenic structures and geomorphic feedbacks we can both characterize and predict shifts in community structure on timescales relevant to coastal systems 5 conclusions we made progress in our efforts to represent a coastal tidal marsh environment in elm we were able to approximate the eco2 and temperature responses of a brackish tidal marsh observed in a whole system manipulation smartx at the gcrew facility in chesapeake bay one key outcome was identifying model parameters for which improved empirical data will improve our ability to simulate smartx responses specifically belowground pft parameters a dynamic new root new shoot c allocation and expanded biogeochemical representations the benefit of starting our work within a current esm framework is the ability to eventually translate from point to global scale simulations without the need to develop or adapt data structures however some modifications are still required primarily linked to

24626,the energy exascale earth system model e3sm simulates fully coupled processes and interactions among water energy carbon and nutrient cycles e3sm connects vegetation and soil dynamics through nutrient uptake plant production litterfall and decomposition as a function of abiotic parameters e g temperature and moisture however e3sm is designed to characterize terrestrial ecosystems and connects land and open ocean systems using a single streamflow transport term ignoring the complex dynamics of energy water carbon and nutrients in coastal systems the goals of our project were to 1 parameterize a point version of e3sm to capture coastal wetland habitats and 2 determine marsh community responses to increased temperature and elevated co2 we adapted a version of the e3sm land model

research wetland gcrew tidal forcing in a marsh environment was simulated using a two column system in which the columns are connected by lateral hydrologic flows one column simulates interactions between vegetation and soil while a second column simulates variation in water level both tidal and sea level rise the updated model captures many aspects of the field experiments showing that plant community responses to environmental change are non linear non additive and different between plant types elevated co2 treatments increased c3 plant biomass more than c4 33 vs 17 temperature exacerbated co2 responses in c3 plants 0 c 26 5 1 c 56 we were more successful at characterizing c3 than c4 responses and simulating above rather than belowground biomass production next steps will

al 2018 gittman et al 2016 o meara et al 2015 functioning coastal habitats mitigate seaward stressors protecting terrestrial ecosystems davis et al 2015 onorevole et al 2018 gittman et al 2016 and landward stressors protecting open ocean ecosystems barbier et al 2011 barbier 2013 finlayson et al 2005 although these habitats are highly productive and provide valuable ecosystem services coastal processes are rarely represented in earth system models esms for example the u s department of energy s energy exascale earth system model e3sm simulates many coupled processes and interactions among water energy carbon and nutrient cycles golaz et al 2019 but ignores most processes and mechanisms operating at terrestrial aquatic interfaces while the e3sm land model elm simulates vegetation and soil processes including plant production nutrient uptake litterfall and decomposition it lacks a mechanistic representation of hydrological ecological and biogeochemical processes connecting upland ecosystems to coasts golaz et al 2019 petersen et al 2019 ricciuto et al 2018 shi et al 2015 tang j and riley 2018 because coastal systems play a vital role in protecting adjacent terrestrial systems from erosion and reducing nutrient flux to the open ocean mechanistic incorporation of these ecosystems in global scale simulations is key to improving global climate projections however there are challenges to adding coastal ecosystem representation to the global scale elm coastal ecosystems in comparison to open ocean or upland terrestrial habitats are characterized by dynamic shifts within short timeframes as they respond to tidally induced diurnal changes in ph salinity oxygen exposure availability light and nutrient supply duarte et al 2008 barbier et al 2011 barbier 2013 costanza et al 1997 which makes them inherently difficult to model ganju et al 2016 ward et al 2020 fagherazzi and priestas 2010 esm frameworks often have a spatial resolution that is too low to characterize coastal dynamics peters lidard et al 2007 ward et al 2020 on a smaller scale successful models of some coastal processes have been created to simulate the hydrology geomorphology and or ecology of these systems but these models often focus on mechanistic representation of a few processes and omit or use empirical representation to define non target processes van oevelen et al 2006 fennel et al 2009 heiss et al 2017 middelburg 1989 rasse et al 2003 volta et al 2014 aller 2004 anderson et al 1997 craft et al 2009 itoh et al 2018 grangere et al 2010 kirwan 2013 by focusing on a single interaction or subset of interactions model assumptions are simplified and computational requirements decreased while this approach is valid based on their spatial scales translation of these model capabilities to larger scales can be difficult since their narrow focus or site specific representations limit their ability to characterize the complexity of highly inter connected and dynamic coastal systems we investigated methods for adapting the e3sm land model elm v1 golaz et al 2019 to describe coastal wetland dynamics using a model configuration that considers processes within a single grid cell we developed new plant functional type parameterizations to mimic coastal wetland vegetation we also modified the model s treatment of sub grid heterogeneity to represent tidal flows and some aspects of lateral subsurface hydrology in coastal wetlands although we demonstrate new capabilities for elm at the level of a single grid cell these modifications can later be applied and evaluated at broader spatial scales within the e3sm framework to represent coastal vegetation and develop the necessary process representations we narrowed our focus to tidal marshes since it is a common habitat type and selected a site the global change research wetland gcrew on the western shore of chesapeake bay because of open access to long term data the gcrew data repository and associated publications provided an extensive library of information for model parameterization megonigal 2020a b we focused on two plant functional types with different photosynthetic strategies a c3 sedge schoenoplectus americanus and a c4 grass spartina patens while both plant species occur at gcrew s americanus is typically found at lower marsh elevations than s patens data from the salt marsh response to temperature experiment smartx noyce et al 2019 were used to evaluate model performance smartx evaluates the effects of elevated temperature in both c3 and c4 communities using above and belowground heating noyce et al 2019 in addition elevated co2 eco2 treatments were conducted in c3 plots to determine the interacting effects of eco2 and rising temperatures on primary production elevation changes and greenhouse gas production noyce et al 2019 accurate characterization of feedbacks among vegetation marsh elevation and hydrology as climate conditions change is important for predicting the survival or loss of tidal marshes and thereby the fate of adjacent ecosystems the effects of eco2 rietl et al 2021 ratliff et al 2015 and warming kirwan and mudd 2012 on intertidal saltmarsh vegetation have been modelled independently but the interacting effects of both stressors have not models that investigated responses of eco2 or warming in saltmarshes ratliff et al 2015 rietl et al 2021 kirwan and mudd 2012 were primarily focused on geomorphic feedbacks related to sea level rise and includes biomass production as a defined function of environmental parameters kirwan and mudd 2012 and rietl et al 2021 defined biomass as a parabolic function of elevation inundation while ratliff et al 2015 defined biomass as a linear function of co2 concentration however models that incorporate mechanistic representation of biomass production including plant phenology and physiology can be used to understand the interacting effects of eco2 warming and shifting hydrologic regimes on saltmarsh vegetation as demonstrated for simulations of other systems such as agricultural land grant et al 1998 grant et al 1999 boreal forests grant 2004 grant et al 2006 and grasslands using the model ecosys or terrestrial peatland shi et al 2021 using elm our goals in this study were to 1 modify and parameterize a point version of elm to mimic tidal marsh and 2 assess c3 and c4 marsh community responses to increased temperature and elevated co2 as investigated in the smartx project 2 methods we modified model process representations for vegetation and hydrology using data collected from gcrew most data are available through gcrew s public data repository megonigal 2020b or through manuscripts published on studies conducted at gcrew megonigal 2020a model performance was evaluated using measurements of net primary productivity npp root biomass shoot biomass and root shoot ratio responses to temperature and eco2 from the in situ smartx project for more information on the in situ smartx experiment please refer to noyce et al 2019 the cruncep atmospheric forcing data viovy 2018 was used for all simulations conducted using elm within e3sm v1 golaz et al 2019 our modified version of elm is openly available through the e3sm github repository uchicago argonne 2018 branch name omeara lnd marsh changes in hydrology and vegetation within our branch of elm are turned on using the marsh flag when running elm using the offline model testbed olmt branch name marsh ricciuto 2020 2 1 hydrology updates 2 1 1 tide simulation intertidal hydrology was mimicked using the two column system initially developed for microtopography of a northern peatland bog shi et al 2015 the original two column system represents interactions between a hummock high elevation and hollow low elevation and their connections to the local drainage system the encircling lag to adapt the hydrology to a tidal marsh the high elevation column was used to represent a marsh platform and the low elevation column was adapted to represent changing water levels in an adjacent tidal channel see graphical abstract tidal water level changes were mimicked using a sinusoidal function generated from tidal gage data 2017 2018 using the microsoft excel solver function the tidal height function h t was generated by determining the lowest sum of residuals between a sine function and tide gage data since elm tests for water conservation within the system water budget calculations were updated to include tidal flux as an external forcing term 2 1 2 infiltration in elm ice forms on the soil surface and below the surface when temperatures reach 273 k or lower which reduces vertical water flow and affects soil saturation in saline intertidal systems salinity and water flow prevent ice formation even at temperature below 273 k therefore we lowered the freezing point of the system to 271 k to account for salinity and vertical water flow in cold conditions 2 1 3 subsurface flow while infiltration and vertical water transport have been observed at gcrew rates of horizontal subsurface water flow are negligible personal observation megonigal within elm subsurface flow was minimized by increasing the distance between the two columns for lateral flow calculations from 1 m to 50 m the increased distance decreased connectivity in the subsurface and created a lag in tidal inundation in the marsh column consistent with field observations 2 2 vegetation parameterization plant functional traits pfts within elm are defined by phenological and photosynthetic traits of the plant trait parameters in elm twenty three were definable based on plant physiological data gathered at the gcrew site table 1 for observations made as part of any experiment conducted at gcrew only ambient or control plot data were used for model parameterization given the range of physiology parameter values supported by observations and known interactions among these parameters in elm ricciuto et al 2018 we conducted an objective optimization exercise to jointly select a set of best fit parameter values realistic parameter ranges were identified using legacy data from the gcrew data repository and random combinations of realistic values were analyzed using monte carlo methods lu et al 2017 ricciuto et al 2018 implemented through the olmt five hundred simulations were run for each marsh type to identify optimal parameter values we compared elm simulated results for yearly npp aboveground npp shoot biomass leaf area index and leaf carbon stock from 1987 to 2010 with gcrew legacy data control or ambient plots only fig 1 although data through 2018 is available through the smithsonian servers we limited our timeframe to 1987 2010 to coincide with publicly available data it should be noted that npp within elm is the sum of aboveground and belowground npp and a non structural carbohydrate storage pool since marsh plant shoots dieback but belowground biomass remains roots and rhizomes combined the non structural pool was included in the belowground biomass defined as yearly npp aboveground npp model performance was assessed using two metrics 1 difference in average value from 1987 to 2010 and 2 σ measured modelled 2 calculated for each year both metrics were summed for all four benchmarks and standardized to the range between 0 and 1 lower values indicated better fit between elm simulations and gcrew data optimized values are shown in table 1 similarity between benchmark data and simulations improved with updated pft definitions but parameterization was more successful for c3 than c4 plants to improve c4 parameterization monte carlo analyses were also used to identify parameters without field data that may be important for pft parameterization table 2 the goal was to identify parameters that should be targeted for future data collection monte carlo parameter value ranges were chosen based on the highest and lowest values for all pfts currently parameterized in elm optimal value ranges were determined based on the ten most successful simulations parameters with the narrowest optimized ranges relative to the tested ranges indicated a strong shift in model fit with subtle value changes this narrow range of acceptable values was used as an indicator of sensitivity subtle changes in rooting distribution and new belowground to aboveground herein root to shoot allocation parameters produced the greatest impact on similarity metrics 2 3 simulating smartx using the optimized vegetation parameters and updated hydrological functions simulations were run using the temperature and eco2 treatments conducted in situ for the smartx project noyce et al 2019 in addition to the ambient temperature treatment three increased temperature treatments were mimicked by increasing near surface air temperature by 1 7 c 3 4 c or 5 1 c following the details of the field experiment noyce et al 2019 elevated co2 treatments were simulated using a fixed atmospheric co2 concentration of 750 ppmv smartx eco2 treatments were crossed only with the highest and lowest temperature treatments 5 1 c and ambient and only in the c3 plots the c4 plots were omitted since previous and ongoing research at the site has shown a negligible influence of eco2 on c4 biomass production drake 2014 elm simulations were conducted for all temperature and eco2 treatments for both c3 and c4 plants in a full cross response ratios and variance were calculated for eco2 effects across all temperatures for c3 gcrew and elm and c4 elm only samples using eqs 1 and 2 respectively lajeunesse 2011 hedges and olkin 1985 hedges et al 1999 1 r r ln x t x c where rr is the response ratio x t is the mean of the treatment group and x c is the mean of the control group 2 σ 2 r r s d c 2 n c x c 2 s d t 2 n t x t 2 where σ 2 r r is the sampling variance sdc and sdt are the standard deviation of the controls and treatments and nc and nt are the sample sizes for controls and treatments respectively 3 results 3 1 intertidal hydrology based on 2017 2018 data intertidal hydrology was defined as tidal height h t using the following function 3 h t 500 sin 3 e 5 π t 513 4328 2 sin 1 e 8 π t 0 9152 800 where t indicates time in seconds since january 1 1850 according to water level data c3 and c4 marshes are inundated 30 and 5 of the time respectively to account for inundation c3 elevation was set at 30 cm above the bed of the tidal channel while c4 elevation was set to 70 cm changes in freezing point resulted in ice lenses formation similar in depth and seasonal duration to ice coverage observed at gcrew fig 2 personal observation megonigal reduced ice coverage decreased vertical flow impedance allowing for more realistic soil saturation rates during the winter months in addition to improving vertical flow modifications to lateral conductivity decreased lateral flow between columns from 5 7 10 3 3 7 10 3 to 2 1 10 5 1 8 10 5 mm h2o s 1 3 2 smartx simulations overall elm results tended to overestimate production 69 9 higher than gcrew results fig 3 primarily by overestimating belowground or root production 373 43 higher than gcrew results simulation errors were generally lower for 2017 than 2018 and c4 simulations were less successful than c3 fig 3 for c3 simulations shoot production was relatively close to observed npp rates at lower temperature and diverged with higher temperature treatments for 2018 0 c 13 error 5 1 c 28 error but the opposite was true for 2017 0 c 19 error 5 1 c 13 error in 2018 root production in c3 simulations peaked with modest temperature increases 1 7 c but not in 2017 fig 3 overall simulated root production rates were higher than anticipated based on in situ observations overestimated by 283 62 modeled root shoot ratios did not follow temperature trends observed at smartx in 2017 but were similar to smartx results in 2018 with a peak at moderate temperature increases root shoot at 0 c and 1 7 c 0 95 followed by a decline with further temperature increases up to 5 1⁰c root shoot 0 74 in addition eco2 increased productivity above and belowground in elm simulations similar to results from smartx however smartx results indicated stronger belowground responses aboveground 8 6 increase belowground 142 21 increase while elm increases were similar between both above 46 17 and belowground 38 17 in 2018 eco2 increased root shoot ratio 0 c 0 09 0 06 5 1 c 0 07 0 15 similar to in situ data but in 2017 simulated root shoot ratio decreased at 5 c 0 c 0 09 0 06 5 1 c 0 07 0 15 response ratios for eco2 effects were similar in both field observations and simulations fig 4 elevated co2 increased root shoot and total biomass production in both field studies and simulations however response ratio for root shoot ratio was positive for smartx and negative for elm for c4 simulations a significant overestimation of belowground production 450 33 led to an overestimation of total production 99 50 and root shoot ratio 563 299 the simulated temperature response of shoot production in 2018 was similar to smartx results but other trends of temperature response differed significantly elm simulations for c4 plants did not show peaks in root production or root shoot ratio at 1 7 c the effects of eco2 were often minimal e g 2017 shoots biomass 10 increase but in some cases it decreased production rates e g 2018 root biomass 29 decrease since previous and ongoing work has shown negligible effects of eco2 on c4 production curtis et al 1990 response ratios were expected to approximate zero elm simulations indicated a net increase in shoot biomass due to eco2 but a decrease in root biomass leading to decrease in both total production and root shoot biomass however the overall response ratio for total production was relatively small compared to c3 simulations to identify c4 traits that would improve reparameterization another sensitivity analysis was conducted with an expanded set of traits table 2 using the expanded trait list improved similarity between c4 simulations and gcrew data fig 3 and results indicated that c4 definitions could improve with additional data on 1 c decomposition primarily sediment organic matter degradation rates and pool structure tied to c n of sediment organic matter pools and 2 soil plant hydraulic interactions e g number of drought days to initiate loss of leaves 4 discussion 4 1 point scale simulations our attempt to parameterize coastal pfts and incorporate intertidal hydrology was modestly successful in both parameter optimization and replication of smartx temperature and eco2 experiment responses to improve these initial efforts we identified parameters that could reduce error and bias with targeted data collection and determined key challenges in translating point scale models to watershed or global scale simulations this work represents the first step to developing a mechanistic representation of coastal environments in elm we were able to generate a two column system consisting of a marsh platform and tidal channel to simulate coastal wetland hydrology we reduced ice formation to account for both water flow and salinity and decreased horizontal subsurface flow to align with the reduced hydraulic conductivity in the organic rich soils at gcrew finally we were able to mimic bi directional tidal flow to simulate periodic inundation these modifications incorporated tidal flow and incorporated feedbacks between inundation and production in addition we created data structures in anticipation of coupling our modified elm model to process based hydrology and geomorphology models our vegetation parameterization generated npp estimates that were more similar to field data for aboveground biomass than belowground biomass and npp responses to eco2 and temperature were better for the c3 community than the c4 community discrepancies between elm and the smartx experimental data in belowground biomass are likely an artefact of parameterization since aboveground biomass was a primary benchmark while belowground biomass arose from total npp estimates that are subject to errors and limitations in both field methods and model structure belowground biomass is far more difficult to observe and the ingrowth core technique used at the gcrew site like many other methods for assessing belowground production has limitations for smartx ingrowth cores were mesh bags filled with root free peat buried below the surface and retrieved 12 months after deployment noyce et al 2019 belowground biomass is determined by growth found within the mesh bag after retrieval however this method can mischaracterize growth by providing a low competition space for root proliferation or creating an exclusion to larger root and rhizomes or grazing due to mesh size in addition ingrowth cores can underestimate production because they do not account for losses due to decomposition or grazing between sampling periods milchunas 2009 and have been shown to provide lower estimates of belowground biomass primarily rhizome biomass compared to soil core neill 1992 or minirhizotron data hendricks et al 2005 while ingrowth cores errors likely have little influence on comparison between treatments since underestimation would be consistent between samples absolute values used for parameterization and validation could generate errors in simulation of belowground production in addition the lack of salinity effects on vegetation growth in elm could lead to a high bias in simulated production rates because elm has a fixed carbon allocation parameter for new root not including the non structural c pool and new shoot growth and benchmark data are skewed towards characterizing aboveground production overestimates in production would more likely affect belowground than aboveground processes however despite this limitation the new model was able to capture important experimental responses observed in smartx plots for c3 communities patterns in npp and root shoot ratio in response to temperature and eco2 treatments were observed in elm simulations including a peak in root biomass under moderate warming fig 3 2018 and increases in biomass with eco2 fig 3 overall response ratios across all temperatures and years were similar in direction and magnitude between smartx and elm simulations for total biomass fig 4 indicating agreement between simulations and field data and responses were similar to previous studies percent change from control c3 average 36 range 66 181 c4 average 3 range 77 90 mckee et al 2012 cherry et al 2009 however the simulations overestimated aboveground response and underestimated belowground response which is expected based on errors in belowground biomass parameterization using ingrowth cores see previous paragraph as a result of the difference in responses in elm vs smartx eco2 decreased root shoot ratio in simulations but in situ responses indicated an increase in c4 communities eco2 had little influence on total production as anticipated but modeled peaks in npp for mild temperature increase and subsequent decline at higher temperatures were not observed in the field experiment we conducted expanded monte carlo analyses and found that simulations could be significantly improved with better parameterization of hydraulic interactions between plants and soil and a better understanding of biogeochemical decomposition processes errors associated with misrepresentation of hydraulic interactions such as soil water potential and plant water requirements are most likely linked to the lack of salinity in elm as discussed above but another issue may be the use of water saturation as a proxy for oxygen availability because plant mediated transport of oxygen occurs during inundated high tide conditions oxygen and water saturation are not directly correlated previous work at the gcrew facility suggests that plant transport of oxygen from the atmosphere into saturated anoxic soils stimulates soil organic matter decomposition rates an effect that is positively related to plant biomass and stimulated by eco2 mueller et al 2016 wolf et al 2007 our expanded parameterization indicated model sensitivity to sediment organic matter degradation rates and c n ratios of organic matter which indicates a dependence on oxygen and n availability since oxygen availability regulates redox conditions and nitrogen is known to be a limiting nutrient in coastal tidal wetlands better characterization in these key factors may improve simulations biogeochemistry in elm is limited to carbon nitrogen and phosphorus however in estuarine environments strong redox gradients an abundant supply of sulfate and fluctuations in solubility with salinity variation mean that the biogeochemistry submodel would benefit from electron acceptor donor pairs beyond carbon and nitrogen mainly iron and sulfate species we are exploring the use of a sophisticated reactive transport code pflotran as a new submodel coupled to elm to capture these dynamics lichtner et al 2019 thornton et al 2009 tang et al 2016 although the current elm decomposition representation is limited to aerobic processes the flexible nature of pflotran facilitates the incorporation of additional biogeochemical reactions needed to describe coastal systems such as salinity anaerobic redox chemistry and ph with improved biogeochemistry and plant soil hydraulic interactions our simulations of coastal environments could be significantly improved in addition work is still necessary to scale our point model simulations to a watershed or global scale 4 2 from point scale to global simulations the need for better representation of coastal processes in global models is well established itoh et al 2018 snelgrove et al 2014 most existing watershed scale models tend to focus on coastal and shallow subtidal processes ignoring intertidal processes and in many cases biological functions snelgrove et al 2014 for example the sea level affecting marshes model slamm www warrenpinnacle com prof slamm incorporates intertidal vegetation as a static boundary condition rather than as a dynamic prognostic model component in addition some watershed and regional scale models do not incorporate mechanistic biogeochemical processing or have a limited number of electron donor acceptor pairs for example biogeochemistry is explicitly outside of the scope of the chesapeake bay water quality and sediment transport model wqstm aka the chesapeake bay model cerco and noel 2017 for the same system the estuarine model rom rca testa et al 2014 brady et al 2013 incorporates biogeochemical cycling for open estuary environments but does not include intertidal habitats the lack of integration between hydrology geomorphology biogeochemistry and ecology in coastal and estuarine models especially in terrestrial aquatic interfaces is often tied to model purpose most of the available models are designed as tools for land management or pollutant fate and transport to identify total maximum daily loads therefore the focus of these models is often tied to a specific environmental parameter of concern such as the spatially referenced regression on watershed attributes sparrow schwarz et al 2006 model the wqstm chesapeake bay program 2020 or epa s water quality analysis simulation program wasp wool et al 2020 watershed models designed to focus on a specific region or subset of processes may not be suitable for connection to global scale models due to mismatched data structures in watershed vs global models it may not be possible to translate mechanistic representations to a larger scale by using elm we have circumvented many of the compatibility issues in translating from a point scale model to a global model but we have only characterized two habitat types and our current simulations do not represent dynamic vegetation shifts observed in coastal systems to increase the scale of our simulation to a watershed or larger we need improved methods for characterizing heterogeneity within the system both spatially and temporally habitat heterogeneity is important to characterize in a system where subtle differences can have important plant community implications as little as 20 cm in elevation can alter water saturation and salinity making conditions more conducive to a c3 or c4 community and the high connectivity between habitats means that spatial distribution plays an important role in defining ecosystem function habitats at the edge of the marsh reduce wave energy creating a more conducive environment for vegetation growth up shore which promotes production bilkovic et al 2017 piazza et al 2005 as marsh production increases erosion rates decrease sedimentation rates increase and vertical accretion can occur enhancing carbon sequestration davis et al 2015 mudd et al 2010 the standard resolution of elm is a 110 110 km grid cell which is not high enough to encompass habitat heterogeneity or potentially track changes in vegetation species distributions but using a flexible multi scale mesh e g model for prediction across scales mpas finite volume community ocean model fvcom we can improve resolution in coastal systems and our ability to incorporate heterogeneity although mpas has not been used specifically for an estuary it has demonstrated success using unstructured horizontal meshes for coastlines of the antarctic ice sheet petersen et al 2019 and fvcom has used an unstructured mesh to simulate estuarine hydrology chen et al 2003 clark et al 2018 however neither mpas nor fvcom incorporates intertidal plant physiology clark et al 2018 or biogeochemistry xue et al 2014 model coupling and incorporation of an unstructured mesh may resolve issues with spatial heterogeneity but temporal heterogeneity is also a concern temporal variation is high due to the migration of coastal communities in response to changing environmental conditions feedbacks between sediment plants and hydrology in tidal wetlands can cause significant shifts in community structure tidal wetland vegetation enhances vertical accretion by reducing wave energy or flow resulting in greater sediment deposition clark et al 2018 kirwan and murray 2007 as sea level rises marshes elevation is maintained through sediment accretion however accreting marshes can quickly become receding marshes due to storms accelerated sea level rise and changes in sediment supply linked to human and or macrofaunal activity kirwan 2013 kirwan and guntenspergen 2012 wilson et al 2012 as the marsh elevation changes the community structure shifts due to changes in inundation regime gedan et al 2009 bertness 1991 to properly simulate dynamic community shifts we need to parameterize vegetated coastal ecosystems other than tidal marshes such as mangroves and submerged aquatic vegetation in addition to vegetation coastal systems also rely on other organisms to create biogenic habitat shellfish reefs and beds worm beds and algal forests and mats can all create habitat defining features since elm is designed using plant functional types pfts the addition of biogenic pfts will require some restructuring to move away from phenology based habitat distinctions by incorporating both biogenic structures and geomorphic feedbacks we can both characterize and predict shifts in community structure on timescales relevant to coastal systems 5 conclusions we made progress in our efforts to represent a coastal tidal marsh environment in elm we were able to approximate the eco2 and temperature responses of a brackish tidal marsh observed in a whole system manipulation smartx at the gcrew facility in chesapeake bay one key outcome was identifying model parameters for which improved empirical data will improve our ability to simulate smartx responses specifically belowground pft parameters a dynamic new root new shoot c allocation and expanded biogeochemical representations the benefit of starting our work within a current esm framework is the ability to eventually translate from point to global scale simulations without the need to develop or adapt data structures however some modifications are still required primarily linked to

24627,soil organic carbon soc turnover simulation models have been widely used to predict soc changes with changing climatic and management conditions rothamsted carbon model rothc 26 3 is one of the most widely used c turnover simulation model however this model has not been extensively tested under the indian conditions model prediction accuracy depends upon correct initialization procedure as wrong initialization can simulate the data incorrectly we initialised the rothc model using the data set from three long term fertilizer experiments ltfe of india the model was parameterized for the pre cultivated soils of the three major soil orders vertisol alfisol and inceptisol of india for the treatments of nil fertilization control balanced fertilization npk and npk farm yard manure fym the rothc was successfully initialized forward mode by iteratively adjusting the c input and inert organic matter iom stock of soil at steady state the agreement between the modelled and measured data of soc stocks across three different soil types was satisfactory with root mean square error rmse for ltfe treatments ranged from 2 to 14 the results of the rothc simulations demonstrated that npk and npk fym increased soc stocks at the 0 30 cm soil depth by 12 61 and 30 107 respectively over the initial value at the three sites the soc stocks reached steady state for the treatments of npk and npk fym between 48 and 95 and 68 to 116 years respectively in three different soil types therefore the rothc model can successfully predict c dynamics under indian conditions provided initialization and parametrization of the model is accurate keywords rothc soil carbon stocks parametrization vertisol alfisol inceptisol 1 introduction organic c storage and co2 sequestration in agricultural soils through better management practices produce a number of benefits in terms of soil biodiversity soil fertility and soil water storage capacity and overall crop productivity as well as greenhouse gas mitigation paustain et al 2019 soil organic carbon soc stock in a soil is the balance of c inputs from net primary productivity and outputs through decomposition jenny 1941 schlesinger 1977 invariably cultivation leads to decline in soc generally in the range of 29 60 from the initial value jenny and raychaudhary 1960 the potential loss of soc due to tillage is higher in the tropics and subtropics in comparison to temperate regions ogle et al 2005 the studies of soc dynamics as affected by different environmental and management induced changes are costly and time consuming especially those with environment and management interaction studies are limited rabbi et al 2013 use of simulation models is an alternative to investigate long term soc dynamics and to explore the scenarios for sequestration of soc under different management practices falloon and smith 2009 smith and smith 2007 appropriately site calibrated process based c models provide an opportunity for evaluation and identification of effective management options for increasing and maintaining soc stocks studies on dynamics of soc using different c simulation models have been widely used to predict soc changes with changing soil climate and management conditions process based soc models are widely used for simulating monitoring and verifying soc change effects of chemical fertilization and organic manure application on soc dynamics can be assessed best using c models in long term experiments and extending beyond the experimental sites and soils ability of most of the soc models to predict the c dynamics from long term studies depend upon the size of the soil c pools that are governed by first order decay rates mcgill 1996 basso et al 2011 paustian 1994 rothamsted jenkinson 1990 century parton et al 1987 and apsim mccown et al 1996 are most widely used c models all these models are based on several conceptual soc pools with different turnover time and decay rate however there is no definite method by which these conceptual c pools can be measured moreover the models developed and calibrated under temperate agro ecosystem ludwig et al 2007 smith et al 1997 studdert et al 2011 are not widely parameterized for simulating long term c dynamics under tropical or subtropical environment diels et al 2004 kamoni et al 2007 shirato et al 2005 skjemstad et al 2004 hence model calibration or initialization under particular soil and climatic conditions is very important for successful prediction of soc dynamics among the many soc models published the rothamsted carbon model rothc coleman and jenkinson 1996 has a simpler structure and requires few input parameters which are easily obtainable moreover rothc has been found to be one of the best performing models across the world smith et al 1997 however the use of any model under specific environmental and management conditions requires a validation procedure with matching observed soc stocks smith et al 1997 previously very limited work was carried out using rothc model under indian conditions bhattacharyya et al 2011 also computation of c input and initialization of model with respect to inert organic matter iom has not been attempted earlier the c inputs are strongly influenced by management practices and getting a good estimate of the real c input to better simulate c output is more difficult than simply adjusting model parameters therefore we carried out this work with a hypothesis that adjusting the c inputs along with iom pool iteratively to fit the initial soc to the measured soc could be an effective initialization method we tested this initialization method for three major soil types alfisol vertisol and inceptisol of india using long term 1972 2010 fertilizer experiments data hence the present work was carried out with two objectives i initialization of rothc model by optimizing iom pool and c input to match observed soc stocks and ii computation of c input and trend of soc stock for the treatments of nil fertilization control balanced fertilization npk and npk farm yard manure fym in the long term fertilizer experiments ltfe in three major soil orders of india the present investigation will provide a basis for using rothc model with special reference to optimization of the iom pool and c inputs under different soil and climatic conditions of india 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study includes three ltfe sites in northern and central india under semi arid to sub humid climatic conditions table 1 these experiments have been conducted under the aegis of all indian coordinated research project aicrp on ltfe the sites at jabalpur and ludhiana are typical subtropical climate with hot wet summers and mild winters whereas that at palampur is in the mid hill of himalaya with wet summers and cold winters in sub humid climate annual average temperatures are 18 3 24 3 and 25 c at palampur ludhiana and jabalpur respectively annual precipitations are 1386 mm at jabalpur 726 mm at ludhiana and 2157 mm at palampur sites the soil at the jabalpur site is clayey in texture with neutral to slightly alkaline ph and a vertisol typic haplusterts soil survey staff 2014 the soil at the palampur site is acidic and silty loam and an alfisol typic hapludalfs the soil at the ludhiana site is sandy loam with neutral to alkaline ph and an inceptisol typic ustochrepts the initial properties of the experimental soils in 1972 are given in table 1 initial soc concentration of the three sites is reported as dichromate h2so4 oxidizable organic c walkley and black 1934 the soc concentration ranged from 2 2 to 7 9 g kg 1 at 0 15 cm depth table 1 2 2 cropping sequence and treatment details the long term experiment had a double cropping system annually at all the three sites soybean wheat was the cropping sequence at jabalpur whereas maize wheat was the cropping sequence at palampur and ludhiana soybean was grown during the rainy season while wheat was grown as an irrigated crop in winter season the double cropping system had a rotation of soybean seeded in late june to early july and wheat seeded in november at ludhiana and palampur maize crop was generally sown in late june or early july and harvested in october wheat was sown in november and harvested in april in all the sites crops were manually harvested leaving not more than 2 5 of previous crop residue ltfe at jabalpur palampur and ludhiana sites were started in 1972 with 10 treatments only three treatments nil fertilization 100 npk and 100 npk fym from ltfe were selected for this study the rates of fertilizers were based on initial soil fertility status at all the three sites nitrogen phosphorus and potassium fertilizers were applied as urea single superphosphate and potassium chloride respectively the fertilizer nutrient application rates to the crops were determined based on soil test values determined at the beginning of the experiment manure was applied before seeding once a year to all the sites at jabalpur fym was applied at the rate of 15 mg ha 1 and at ludhiana and palampur it was applied at the rate of 10 mg ha 1 usually 15 days before sowing of a kharif crop maize at palampur and ludhiana and soybean at jabalpur 2 3 soil analyses in ltfe of india each year 1972 onwards soc was determined by acid potassium dichromate oxidation method walkley and black 1934 data of walkley and black c wbc concentration of all the three sites were obtained from the published annual reports and technical bulletins singh and wanjari 2017 singh et al 2019 all the sites under present investigation do not have total soc data from 1972 to 2010 hence we used the equation of jha et al 2014a to convert wbc to total soc in brief for developing a relationship between oxidizable c and total soc soil samples were collected from the topsoil 0 15 cm from different agro ecological regions of india the soil samples were mixed thoroughly and air dried air dried soil was sieved through 2 mm screen representative sub samples were crushed to 0 25 mm for measurements of total soc by the dry combustion method nelson and sommers 1996 using a shimadzu toc total organic c analyzer make ssm5000a the regression equation uses silt and clay content along with mean annual precipitation for conversion of wbc to soc this equation was thoroughly validated for different indian soils in the present investigation since wbc was measured at 0 15 cm of soil depth total soc in the top 30 cm soil layer soc0 30 cm was estimated based on soc vertical distribution assumption outlined in the equations wang et al 2013 qin and huang 2010 below i so c 0 30 cm 1 32 so c 0 20 cm ii so c 0 30 cm 2 35 so c 0 10 cm here we used average value of the coefficients of 0 10 and 10 20 cm of soc stocks for the co efficient for soc stock for the 0 15 cm depth iii so c 0 30 cm 1 835 so c 0 15 cm soil c stock was calculated following the method described by batjes 1996 it involved multiplication of area m2 by soc bulk density mg m 3 and thickness of the layer m 2 4 model description and initialization rothc 26 3 is a model for the turnover of organic c in non waterlogged arable top soils that allows for the effects of soil type temperature moisture content and plant cover on the soil c turnover processes the model uses a monthly time step to calculate total soc t ha 1 microbial biomass c t ha 1 and δ14c from which the equivalent radiocarbon age of the soil is calculated on a year to centuries timescale jenkinson et al 1987 jenkinson 1990 jenkinson et al 1991 jenkinson et al 1992 jenkinson and coleman 1994 rothc is designed to run in two modes forward in which known inputs are used to calculate changes in soil organic matter and inverse when inputs are calculated from known changes in soil organic matter to fit the model to the soc data from these three ltfe sites the model was run in the forward mode with an annual c input ci that was determined by the equation of bolinder et al 2007 which computes c input based upon the yield of the crop keel et al 2017 iv ci cp sp cs ss cr sr ce se here cp is the amount of plant c in the main agricultural product mostly grain cs is c in aboveground by product straw stubble residue haulm cr is c in root tissue ce in extra root material including rhizodeposition and s is the proportion of each fraction that is ultimately returned to the soil sp ss sr se the cp is calculated from the dry matter yield ydm and the c concentration cc which is assumed to be 0 45 kg kg 1 for all plant parts v cp ydm cc vi cs rs rp cp vii cr rr rp cp viii ce re rp cp here r is the ratio of the respective c fraction to net primary productivity we determined the below ground c input only to the depth of 30 cm as we calibrated and validated the model for soc stocks to the depth of 30 cm distribution of root with depth was described with an asymptomatic equation gale and grigal 1987 ix rf 1 β depth where rf is the cumulative root fraction from the soil surface to a certain depth cm and β is biome specific parameter 0 961 for crops based on this equation we determined a scaling factor sf for belowground c input x sf 1 β depth 1 β depthallomeq in equation x generally depth is equal to 100 cm and bolinder assumed depthallomeq of 40 cm for agricultural crops however in our work we used depth of 30 cm in place of 100 cm as we are measuring changes in soc stock confined to the top 30 cm of soil depth only while initializing the rothc model we assumed that the soc stock in the beginning equilibrium condition of the study 1972 was at steady state equilibrium with respect to c input of nil fertilization treatment depending upon the change in soc concentration over time scale under the nil fertilization treatment the c input was tuned increased decreased unchanged for the steady state for a particular site fig 1 the iom pool was selected iteratively to give the soc stock that matches it at the start of each experiment generally this pool changes only over centuries time scale but over the timeframe of present experiment we assumed no change in iom content accordingly at steady state c inputs of 1 3 0 2 0 32 mg ha 1 y 1 and iom pools of 21 75 39 35 and 11 55 mg ha 1 was fixed for the jabalpur palampur and ludhiana sites respectively table 2 soc stocks predictions for the three treatments were carried out by using optimized iom pools and c inputs at each location determined by the equation iv the climate data presented in table 1 were used to initialize the model mean monthly air temperature mat and mean annual rainfall precipitation were estimated from the nearest standard meteorological station for each site the model consists of 5 pools a easily decomposable plant material dpm b resistant plant material rpm c microbial biomass bio d humus hum and e iom which is highly resistant to microbial decomposition at each site all the 5 optimized soc pools as listed in table 2 were used for running the model the decay of the pools dpm rpm bio and hum follows first order kinetics and the decomposition rate constants year 1 are 10 0 dpm 0 3 rpm 0 66 bio and 0 02 hum coleman and jenkinson 1999 2 5 statistical analysis grain yields of the crops were obtained from the published annual reports of ltfe 1972 2010 grain yields did not show a consistent temporal trend the mean values and standard errors for the treatments are shown in table 3 linear regression models with 95 confidence intervals were used to analyze differences between observed and predicted soc stocks the performance of the model predictions of the c dynamics was evaluated by calculation of the root mean square error rmse rmse i 1 n p i o i 2 n where pi predicted value oi observed value n number of observations 3 results average grain yields of crops were low for the nil fertilization treatment at all the three ltfe sites table 3 application of fertilizer significantly increased grain yields at all the three sites combined application of npk with fym recorded the highest grain yield at all the three sites in the vertisol at the jabalpur site application of npk resulted in 120 and 253 improvement in soybean and wheat yields respectively over the nil fertilization treatment application of organic manure fym along with npk further resulted in 10 5 and 9 8 improvement in soybean and wheat yields respectively over the npk treatment in the alfisol at the palampur site the responses to npk applications were 11 and 6 folds for maize and wheat respectively at this site also combined application of fym and npk resulted in 44 and 33 improvement in maize and wheat yields over the npk treatment respectively in the inceptisol at the ludhiana site average yields of maize and wheat in the nil fertilization treatment were 899 and 1206 kg ha 1 respectively npk application resulted in 3 and 3 8 fold increase in grain yield of maize and wheat respectively responses of fym over the npk treatment were 38 7 and 8 higher for maize and wheat respectively the approach by bolinder et al 2007 which relates c inputs to crop yield by additionally considering rhizodeposition was used for c input calculation additionally the measured fym c input was added to the computed c input through crop under the treatment of npk fym annual c inputs showed same order of increase across all three sites table 3 the c inputs which came from belowground biomass were much smaller for those treatments where grain yields were small and ranged from 0 20 to 4 0 mg c ha 1 year 1 across all the treatments the largest input of plant c occurred as expected in the npk fym treatment followed by the npk treatment smallest input of plant c occurred in the nil fertilization treatment c input at the jabalpur site in the nil fertilization npk and npk fym were 0 75 2 19 and 4 02 mg ha 1 year 1 in the alfisol at the palampur site plant c inputs were 0 20 1 67 and 3 92 mg ha 1 year 1 in the nil fertilization npk and npk fym respectively in the inceptisol at the ludhiana site plant c inputs were 0 65 2 3 and 3 9 mg ha 1 year 1 in the nil fertilization npk and npk fym respectively rothc 26 3 is made to run in two modes forward in which known c inputs are used to calculate the changes in soil organic matter and inverse when c inputs are calculated at steady state for 10 000 years from known changes in soil organic matter here we ran the model at steady state in forward mode with known initial 1972 soc stock table 2 we determined total c inputs table 3 at the three sites using the equation proposed by bolinder et al 2007 depending upon the trend of soc stock under nil fertilization treatment we iteratively adjusted increased decreased unchanged c input and iom pool in such a way that the simulated soc stock matched the measured soc stock initial value at steady state at each of the locations the estimated soc stocks and soc pools at steady state differed among the treatments table 2 accordingly iom pool of the vertisol at the jabalpur site was fixed at 21 75 mg ha 1 which was 64 of total soc stock at the steady state with c input of 1 30 mg c ha 1 y 1 in the alfisol at the palampur site iom pool was 39 35 mg ha 1 which was 97 of the total c stock with c input of 0 20 mg c ha 1 y 1 in the inceptisol at the ludhiana site iom pool was fixed at 11 55 mg ha 1 which was 86 of the soc stock with c input of 0 32 mg c ha 1 y 1 the model was parameterized with these iom pools soc pools and c inputs at steady state table 2 initial conditions pools of iom and the other four pools were obtained for each soil type as described in table 2 in the vertisol at the jabalpur site the soc stock in the beginning of the study 1972 was 33 5 mg ha 1 at 0 30 cm depth observed soc stock 0 30 cm depth in the treatment of nil fertilization was almost constant even after 38 years whereas in the npk and npk fym treatments soc stock increased over time fig 2 the highest soc stock was in the treatment of npk fym followed by npk treatment after 38 years soc stocks increased by 20 and 46 in the npk and the npk fym treatments respectively the modelled soc stocks in the 0 30 cm soil layer were similar to the observed values the fit of the model to the measured points for soc was good for npk r2 0 78 and npk fym r2 0 85 with rmse of 1 9 2 5 and 1 9 mg c ha 1 respectively in the alfisol at the palampur site the initial soc stock was 40 50 mg ha 1 the observed soc stock to the depth of 30 cm was almost unchanged even after 38 years in the treatment of nil fertilization whereas it was increased by 12 and 30 in the treatments of npk and npk fym fig 3 the simulated soc stock trend in 0 30 cm of soil layer corresponded well with the observed value in the nil fertilization treatment rmse 1 1 mg ha 1 for the npk treatment simulated soc stock also corresponded well with the observed value with rmse of 0 9 mg ha 1 r2 0 78 however the simulated soc stock for the npk fym treatment was slightly overestimated in comparison to the observed value rmse 2 3 mg ha 1 r2 0 53 in the inceptisol at the ludhiana site initial soc stock in the 0 30 cm soil layer was 13 67 mg ha 1 at the end of 38 years observed soc stock was increased to 17 37 mg ha 1 an increase of 27 in the soc stock even under the nil fertilization treatment fig 4 similarly observed soc stock increased by 61 and 107 under npk and npk fym treatments respectively the simulated soc stock in the 0 30 cm soil layer was matched well with the observed value in nil fertilization treatment rmse 1 4 mg ha 1 r2 0 77 for the npk and npk fym treatments simulated value of soc stocks was slightly overestimated in comparison to the observed value however there was a good correlation between the observed and predicted soc stock in the 0 30 cm soil layer under the npk rmse 2 7 mg ha 1 r2 0 84 and the npk fym rmse 3 1 mg ha 1 r2 0 91 treatments after parameterization rothc 26 3 was run for a period of 200 years to determine the steady state c maximum attainable c under the treatments of nil fertilization npk and npk fym at all the three sites fig 5 table 4 it was observed that in the vertisol at the jabalpur site steady state soc stocks of 29 0 41 0 and 60 0 mg ha 1 will reach after 55 48 and 108 years in the nil fertilization npk and npk fym respectively in the alfisol at the palampur site the soc stock 40 6 mg ha 1 in the nil fertilization treatment was already at steady state in the npk and npk fym treatments soc stocks of 49 0 and 57 mg ha 1 will reach steady state after 40 and 62 years respectively in the inceptisol at the ludhiana site soc stocks of 15 9 26 3 and 37 6 mg ha 1 in the nil fertilization npk and npk fym treatments will reach steady state after 44 95 and 116 years respectively 4 discussion the amount of soc stock is controlled primarily by c input through net primary production and c loss through decomposition simulation accuracy of global bio geochemical c model depends on the initial c content of soil and their relative distribution of soil c pools the availability of reliable measurements of total soc stock may not be sufficient to properly initialize soil c models here an effort was made to parameterize the rothc model for simulation in three major soil orders vertisols alfisols and inceptisols using data set of ltfe of india rothc model provides flexibility to simulate soil c turnover with user estimates of c input and partitioning of soil c in different pools several studies have demonstrated that rothc successfully simulated soil c dynamics under different soil and climatic conditions liu et al 2009 mishra et al 2019 senapati et al 2014 guo et al 2007 ludwig et al 2010 li et al 2016 2007 kamoni et al 2007 this demonstrates that rothc could provide an estimate of soil c dynamics in arable soil and could be used as a tool to decide management intervention for sequestering c in soil grain yields in the treatments without fertilization were low for the crops soybean maize and wheat at all the three sites the yield of a crop was markedly improved with application of npk and npk fym availability of nutrients is generally constrained in nil fertilization treatment in long term experiments due to fertility depletion which adversely affects crop growth and reduces productivity singh et al 2007 jagadamma et al 2008 jha et al 2014b response to chemical fertilization and organic manure application could be attributed to increased availability of plant nutrients in soil for growth and development of crops also application of balanced fertilization influences yield of crops by increasing the above and below ground biomass due to the supply of plant nutrients in adequate quantities consequently it resulted in increase in the som stock mcnair bostick et al 2007 through an increase in amount of belowground biomass in our study we run the model in forward mode we computed c inputs using bolinder et al 2007 approach keel et al 2017 reported that large uncertainty in modeled soil c is attributed solely to the allometric equation used to estimate the soil c inputs according to them the comparison to measured and simulated c stocks is the option to evaluate the reliability of allometric equations based on this assumption they concluded that the bolinder et al 2007 equation is the most appropriate to estimate soil c inputs c input is one of the most important driving variables for predicting the net rate of soc changes bolinder et al 2006 it is well documented that better predictions of model were achieved by using an empirically derived regression equation between crop yields and residue input ludwig et al 2007 2010 here we used equation of bolinder et al 2007 for computation of belowground c input as it also takes into account the rhizodeposits c table 1 in general c input to soil followed similar trend as of crop yield at all the three sites application of npk and npk fym considerably increased c input to soil the annual c inputs averaged across all the crops and treatments ranged from 0 21 to 4 01 mg c ha 1 year 1 it was the lowest in the nil fertilization treatment and the highest in the npk fym treatment mostly initialization of rothc model involves running the model until a steady state spin up run is reached and when the soc pools are stabilized initially we also attempted similar approach to parameterize the model however the model simulated soc stocks could not match with the observed data data not shown in the present investigation we did not use falloon et al 1998 approach for estimation of iom generally if no radiocarbon measurements are available iom pool is set using the equation of falloon et al 1998 which is a very rough estimate as well as incorrect conceptually ludwig et al 2010 the inert or passive pool fraction does not change as a result of change in management and climate thus the stock of total soc should not change either if the falloon equation had a strict validity ludwig et al 2010 furthermore for parameterization of rothc model skjemstad et al 2004 and zimmermann et al 2007 used experimental fractionation approach for an estimation of the pools the experimental fractionation is not well established and several uncertainties are associated with it we followed a different approach here we optimized the iom pool using the c input of nil fertilization treatment depending upon the change in soc concentration over time in the nil fertilization treatment the c input was tuned increased decreased unchanged for a steady state condition for a particular site as the c input at steady state is completely unknown fig 1 hence we changed optimized annual c input along with the iom pool iteratively to match simulated soc stocks with the observed soc stocks at steady state i e before the start of the experiment accordingly c inputs of 1 3 0 2 0 32 mg ha 1 y 1 and the iom pools of 21 75 39 35 and 11 55 mg ha 1 at steady state were fixed for the jabalpur palampur and ludhiana sites respectively similar approach of optimized c inputs was used by smith et al 1997 and guo et al 2007 nemo et al 2017 found that adjusting the total soc stock at steady state to the observed soc stock showed less variation in the individual soc pools and total soc stock likewise ludwig et al 2010 matched observed soc stocks with simulated soc stocks using similar approach in quzhou county of china in our work the iom pool contributed from 64 to 97 of the total soc stock at the three ltfe sites such high percentage of iom pool indicates that soc stocks of the soils were close to a minimum threshold value before the start of the experimentation after parameterization of the model input parameters we modelled soc stocks of the nil fertilization npk and npk fym treatments of three long term fertilizer experiments of india rothc successfully captured the trend of c stocks at all the three sites the model simulated soc stock matched well with the measured soc stock in the nil fertilization and npk treatments the agreement between the modelled and measured data was satisfactory rmse value for ltfe sites ranged from 2 to 14 literature data of rmse values in long term experiments with rothc model are reported in the range of 2 30 smith et al 1997 falloon smith 2002 guo et al 2007 therefore our rmse values were within this range at the ludhiana site the model slightly overestimated soc stocks in the npk fym treatment this overestimation of soc stock by rothc in the npk fym treatment might be due to the overestimation of the c inputs or inaccurate dpm rpm ratio used in the model senapati et al 2014 another reason could be the estimates of c concentration and moisture content of fym although it was reported that fym was applied on dry weight basis it may be possible that c contributed through fym was lower than the computed amount probably due to higher moisture content or lower c concentration an overestimation of soil c input could build up soc stock and thus provides the model overestimates of soc stock in the nil fertilization treatment at the palampur site soc stock in the alfisol remained at a steady state whereas it increased in the inceptisol at the ludhiana site at the jabalpur site soc stock of the nil fertilization treatment declined at a very slow rate yang et al 2003 also reported that imbalanced fertilization fails to maintain soc levels under conditions of conventional management system in treatments where no aboveground crop residues are returned to the soil at all the three sites long term application of npk or npk fym significantly increased the soc stocks build up of soc stocks under balanced fertilization and npk fym has also been reported by others bharadwaj and omanwar 1994 schjonning et al 1994 hati et al 2008 soc stock was increased by 20 12 and 61 for the treatments of npk over the initial soc stock at the jabalpur palampur and ludhiana sites respectively whereas it was increased by 46 30 and 107 over the initial value for the treatment of npk fym at the jabalpur palampur and ludhiana sites respectively similar observations were made by manna et al 2005 who also reported that soc sequestration rate was higher in vertisols followed by inceptisols and alfisols where fym was applied along with npk fertilizers the results corroborated that application of organic manure has pronounced effect on soc maintenance and accumulation in cropping systems this is in accordance with the results obtained from long term experiments kanchikerimath and singh 2001 rudrappa et al 2006 in the present study the soc stock under different climatic conditions will reach a steady state between 40 and 108 years ipcc 2003 2006 used empirical approach and projected net soc stock changes over a 20 year period although this may take much longer even more than 100 years poulton et al 2018 steady state soc stocks could be achieved ranging from 20 to more than 100 years qin and huang 2010 the difference in time to attain the steady state depends on the interaction between climatic factors soil type and the combination of multiple management practices 5 conclusions rothc 26 3 can be successfully parameterized to predict trend of soc stocks and adequately simulated the change in soc storage under indian climatic soil and management conditions optimization of annual c input along with iom pool iteratively changed is essential to match simulated soc stocks with observed soc stocks rothc successfully captured the trend of c stocks for the treatments of nil fertilization npk and npk fym in the three soils vertisol inceotisol and alfisol at the three sites in the long term experiments in india however there is a need to test the rothc 26 3 under the practice of conservation agriculture particularly in no till system with variable amounts of residue retention credit authorship contribution

24627,soil organic carbon soc turnover simulation models have been widely used to predict soc changes with changing climatic and management conditions rothamsted carbon model rothc 26 3 is one of the most widely used c turnover simulation model however this model has not been extensively tested under the indian conditions model prediction accuracy depends upon correct initialization procedure as wrong initialization can simulate the data incorrectly we initialised the rothc model using the data set from three long term fertilizer experiments ltfe of india the model was parameterized for the pre cultivated soils of the three major soil orders vertisol alfisol and inceptisol of india for the treatments of nil fertilization control balanced fertilization npk and npk farm yard manure fym the rothc was successfully initialized forward mode by iteratively adjusting the c input and inert organic matter iom stock of soil at steady state the agreement between the modelled and measured data of soc stocks across three different soil types was satisfactory with root mean square error rmse for ltfe treatments ranged from 2 to 14 the results of the rothc simulations demonstrated that npk and npk fym increased soc stocks at the 0 30 cm soil depth by 12 61 and 30 107 respectively over the initial value at the three sites the soc stocks reached steady state for the treatments of npk and npk fym between 48 and 95 and 68 to 116 years respectively in three different soil types therefore the rothc model can successfully predict c dynamics under indian conditions provided initialization and parametrization of the model is accurate keywords rothc soil carbon stocks parametrization vertisol alfisol inceptisol 1 introduction organic c storage and co2 sequestration in agricultural soils through better management practices produce a number of benefits in terms of soil biodiversity soil fertility and soil water storage capacity and overall crop productivity as well as greenhouse gas mitigation paustain et al 2019 soil organic carbon soc stock in a soil is the balance of c inputs from net primary productivity and outputs through decomposition jenny 1941 schlesinger 1977 invariably cultivation leads to decline in soc generally in the range of 29 60 from the initial value jenny and raychaudhary 1960 the potential loss of soc due to tillage is higher in the tropics and subtropics in comparison to temperate regions ogle et al 2005 the studies of soc dynamics as affected by different environmental and management induced changes are costly and time consuming especially those with environment and management interaction studies are limited rabbi et al 2013 use of simulation models is an alternative to investigate long term soc dynamics and to explore the scenarios for sequestration of soc under different management practices falloon and smith 2009 smith and smith 2007 appropriately site calibrated process based c models provide an opportunity for evaluation and identification of effective management options for increasing and maintaining soc stocks studies on dynamics of soc using different c simulation models have been widely used to predict soc changes with changing soil climate and management conditions process based soc models are widely used for simulating monitoring and verifying soc change effects of chemical fertilization and organic manure application on soc dynamics can be assessed best using c models in long term experiments and extending beyond the experimental sites and soils ability of most of the soc models to predict the c dynamics from long term studies depend upon the size of the soil c pools that are governed by first order decay rates mcgill 1996 basso et al 2011 paustian 1994 rothamsted jenkinson 1990 century parton et al 1987 and apsim mccown et al 1996 are most widely used c models all these models are based on several conceptual soc pools with different turnover time and decay rate however there is no definite method by which these conceptual c pools can be measured moreover the models developed and calibrated under temperate agro ecosystem ludwig et al 2007 smith et al 1997 studdert et al 2011 are not widely parameterized for simulating long term c dynamics under tropical or subtropical environment diels et al 2004 kamoni et al 2007 shirato et al 2005 skjemstad et al 2004 hence model calibration or initialization under particular soil and climatic conditions is very important for successful prediction of soc dynamics among the many soc models published the rothamsted carbon model rothc coleman and jenkinson 1996 has a simpler structure and requires few input parameters which are easily obtainable moreover rothc has been found to be one of the best performing models across the world smith et al 1997 however the use of any model under specific environmental and management conditions requires a validation procedure with matching observed soc stocks smith et al 1997 previously very limited work was carried out using rothc model under indian conditions bhattacharyya et al 2011 also computation of c input and initialization of model with respect to inert organic matter iom has not been attempted earlier the c inputs are strongly influenced by management practices and getting a good estimate of the real c input to better simulate c output is more difficult than simply adjusting model parameters therefore we carried out this work with a hypothesis that adjusting the c inputs along with iom pool iteratively to fit the initial soc to the measured soc could be an effective initialization method we tested this initialization method for three major soil types alfisol vertisol and inceptisol of india using long term 1972 2010 fertilizer experiments data hence the present work was carried out with two objectives i initialization of rothc model by optimizing iom pool and c input to match observed soc stocks and ii computation of c input and trend of soc stock for the treatments of nil fertilization control balanced fertilization npk and npk farm yard manure fym in the long term fertilizer experiments ltfe in three major soil orders of india the present investigation will provide a basis for using rothc model with special reference to optimization of the iom pool and c inputs under different soil and climatic conditions of india 2 materials and

of all indian coordinated research project aicrp on ltfe the sites at jabalpur and ludhiana are typical subtropical climate with hot wet summers and mild winters whereas that at palampur is in the mid hill of himalaya with wet summers and cold winters in sub humid climate annual average temperatures are 18 3 24 3 and 25 c at palampur ludhiana and jabalpur respectively annual precipitations are 1386 mm at jabalpur 726 mm at ludhiana and 2157 mm at palampur sites the soil at the jabalpur site is clayey in texture with neutral to slightly alkaline ph and a vertisol typic haplusterts soil survey staff 2014 the soil at the palampur site is acidic and silty loam and an alfisol typic hapludalfs the soil at the ludhiana site is sandy loam with neutral to alkaline ph and an inceptisol typic ustochrepts the initial properties of the experimental soils in 1972 are given in table 1 initial soc concentration of the three sites is reported as dichromate h2so4 oxidizable organic c walkley and black 1934 the soc concentration ranged from 2 2 to 7 9 g kg 1 at 0 15 cm depth table 1 2 2 cropping sequence and treatment details the long term experiment had a double cropping system annually at all the three sites soybean wheat was the cropping sequence at jabalpur whereas maize wheat was the cropping sequence at palampur and ludhiana soybean was grown during the rainy season while wheat was grown as an irrigated crop in winter season the double cropping system had a rotation of soybean seeded in late june to early july and wheat seeded in november at ludhiana and palampur maize crop was generally sown in late june or early july and harvested in october wheat was sown in november and harvested in april in all the sites crops were manually harvested leaving not more than 2 5 of previous crop residue ltfe at jabalpur palampur and ludhiana sites were started in 1972 with 10 treatments only three treatments nil fertilization 100 npk and 100 npk fym from ltfe were selected for this study the rates of fertilizers were based on initial soil fertility status at all the three sites nitrogen phosphorus and potassium fertilizers were applied as urea single superphosphate and potassium chloride respectively the fertilizer nutrient application rates to the crops were determined based on soil test values determined at the beginning of the experiment manure was applied before seeding once a year to all the sites at jabalpur fym was applied at the rate of 15 mg ha 1 and at ludhiana and palampur it was applied at the rate of 10 mg ha 1 usually 15 days before sowing of a kharif crop maize at palampur and ludhiana and soybean at jabalpur 2 3 soil analyses in ltfe of india each year 1972 onwards soc was determined by acid potassium dichromate oxidation method walkley and black 1934 data of walkley and black c wbc concentration of all the three sites were obtained from the published annual reports and technical bulletins singh and wanjari 2017 singh et al 2019 all the sites under present investigation do not have total soc data from 1972 to 2010 hence we used the equation of jha et al 2014a to convert wbc to total soc in brief for developing a relationship between oxidizable c and total soc soil samples were collected from the topsoil 0 15 cm from different agro ecological regions of india the soil samples were mixed thoroughly and air dried air dried soil was sieved through 2 mm screen representative sub samples were crushed to 0 25 mm for measurements of total soc by the dry combustion method nelson and sommers 1996 using a shimadzu toc total organic c analyzer make ssm5000a the regression equation uses silt and clay content along with mean annual precipitation for conversion of wbc to soc this equation was thoroughly validated for different indian soils in the present investigation since wbc was measured at 0 15 cm of soil depth total soc in the top 30 cm soil layer soc0 30 cm was estimated based on soc vertical distribution assumption outlined in the equations wang et al 2013 qin and huang 2010 below i so c 0 30 cm 1 32 so c 0 20 cm ii so c 0 30 cm 2 35 so c 0 10 cm here we used average value of the coefficients of 0 10 and 10 20 cm of soc stocks for the co efficient for soc stock for the 0 15 cm depth iii so c 0 30 cm 1 835 so c 0 15 cm soil c stock was calculated following the method described by batjes 1996 it involved multiplication of area m2 by soc bulk density mg m 3 and thickness of the layer m 2 4 model description and initialization rothc 26 3 is a model for the turnover of organic c in non waterlogged arable top soils that allows for the effects of soil type temperature moisture content and plant cover on the soil c turnover processes the model uses a monthly time step to calculate total soc t ha 1 microbial biomass c t ha 1 and δ14c from which the equivalent radiocarbon age of the soil is calculated on a year to centuries timescale jenkinson et al 1987 jenkinson 1990 jenkinson et al 1991 jenkinson et al 1992 jenkinson and coleman 1994 rothc is designed to run in two modes forward in which known inputs are used to calculate changes in soil organic matter and inverse when inputs are calculated from known changes in soil organic matter to fit the model to the soc data from these three ltfe sites the model was run in the forward mode with an annual c input ci that was determined by the equation of bolinder et al 2007 which computes c input based upon the yield of the crop keel et al 2017 iv ci cp sp cs ss cr sr ce se here cp is the amount of plant c in the main agricultural product mostly grain cs is c in aboveground by product straw stubble residue haulm cr is c in root tissue ce in extra root material including rhizodeposition and s is the proportion of each fraction that is ultimately returned to the soil sp ss sr se the cp is calculated from the dry matter yield ydm and the c concentration cc which is assumed to be 0 45 kg kg 1 for all plant parts v cp ydm cc vi cs rs rp cp vii cr rr rp cp viii ce re rp cp here r is the ratio of the respective c fraction to net primary productivity we determined the below ground c input only to the depth of 30 cm as we calibrated and validated the model for soc stocks to the depth of 30 cm distribution of root with depth was described with an asymptomatic equation gale and grigal 1987 ix rf 1 β depth where rf is the cumulative root fraction from the soil surface to a certain depth cm and β is biome specific parameter 0 961 for crops based on this equation we determined a scaling factor sf for belowground c input x sf 1 β depth 1 β depthallomeq in equation x generally depth is equal to 100 cm and bolinder assumed depthallomeq of 40 cm for agricultural crops however in our work we used depth of 30 cm in place of 100 cm as we are measuring changes in soc stock confined to the top 30 cm of soil depth only while initializing the rothc model we assumed that the soc stock in the beginning equilibrium condition of the study 1972 was at steady state equilibrium with respect to c input of nil fertilization treatment depending upon the change in soc concentration over time scale under the nil fertilization treatment the c input was tuned increased decreased unchanged for the steady state for a particular site fig 1 the iom pool was selected iteratively to give the soc stock that matches it at the start of each experiment generally this pool changes only over centuries time scale but over the timeframe of present experiment we assumed no change in iom content accordingly at steady state c inputs of 1 3 0 2 0 32 mg ha 1 y 1 and iom pools of 21 75 39 35 and 11 55 mg ha 1 was fixed for the jabalpur palampur and ludhiana sites respectively table 2 soc stocks predictions for the three treatments were carried out by using optimized iom pools and c inputs at each location determined by the equation iv the climate data presented in table 1 were used to initialize the model mean monthly air temperature mat and mean annual rainfall precipitation were estimated from the nearest standard meteorological station for each site the model consists of 5 pools a easily decomposable plant material dpm b resistant plant material rpm c microbial biomass bio d humus hum and e iom which is highly resistant to microbial decomposition at each site all the 5 optimized soc pools as listed in table 2 were used for running the model the decay of the pools dpm rpm bio and hum follows first order kinetics and the decomposition rate constants year 1 are 10 0 dpm 0 3 rpm 0 66 bio and 0 02 hum coleman and jenkinson 1999 2 5 statistical analysis grain yields of the crops were obtained from the published annual reports of ltfe 1972 2010 grain yields did not show a consistent temporal trend the mean values and standard errors for the treatments are shown in table 3 linear regression models with 95 confidence intervals were used to analyze differences between observed and predicted soc stocks the performance of the model predictions of the c dynamics was evaluated by calculation of the root mean square error rmse rmse i 1 n p i o i 2 n where pi predicted value oi observed value n number of observations 3 results average grain yields of crops were low for the nil fertilization treatment at all the three ltfe sites table 3 application of fertilizer significantly increased grain yields at all the three sites combined application of npk with fym recorded the highest grain yield at all the three sites in the vertisol at the jabalpur site application of npk resulted in 120 and 253 improvement in soybean and wheat yields respectively over the nil fertilization treatment application of organic manure fym along with npk further resulted in 10 5 and 9 8 improvement in soybean and wheat yields respectively over the npk treatment in the alfisol at the palampur site the responses to npk applications were 11 and 6 folds for maize and wheat respectively at this site also combined application of fym and npk resulted in 44 and 33 improvement in maize and wheat yields over the npk treatment respectively in the inceptisol at the ludhiana site average yields of maize and wheat in the nil fertilization treatment were 899 and 1206 kg ha 1 respectively npk application resulted in 3 and 3 8 fold increase in grain yield of maize and wheat respectively responses of fym over the npk treatment were 38 7 and 8 higher for maize and wheat respectively the approach by bolinder et al 2007 which relates c inputs to crop yield by additionally considering rhizodeposition was used for c input calculation additionally the measured fym c input was added to the computed c input through crop under the treatment of npk fym annual c inputs showed same order of increase across all three sites table 3 the c inputs which came from belowground biomass were much smaller for those treatments where grain yields were small and ranged from 0 20 to 4 0 mg c ha 1 year 1 across all the treatments the largest input of plant c occurred as expected in the npk fym treatment followed by the npk treatment smallest input of plant c occurred in the nil fertilization treatment c input at the jabalpur site in the nil fertilization npk and npk fym were 0 75 2 19 and 4 02 mg ha 1 year 1 in the alfisol at the palampur site plant c inputs were 0 20 1 67 and 3 92 mg ha 1 year 1 in the nil fertilization npk and npk fym respectively in the inceptisol at the ludhiana site plant c inputs were 0 65 2 3 and 3 9 mg ha 1 year 1 in the nil fertilization npk and npk fym respectively rothc 26 3 is made to run in two modes forward in which known c inputs are used to calculate the changes in soil organic matter and inverse when c inputs are calculated at steady state for 10 000 years from known changes in soil organic matter here we ran the model at steady state in forward mode with known initial 1972 soc stock table 2 we determined total c inputs table 3 at the three sites using the equation proposed by bolinder et al 2007 depending upon the trend of soc stock under nil fertilization treatment we iteratively adjusted increased decreased unchanged c input and iom pool in such a way that the simulated soc stock matched the measured soc stock initial value at steady state at each of the locations the estimated soc stocks and soc pools at steady state differed among the treatments table 2 accordingly iom pool of the vertisol at the jabalpur site was fixed at 21 75 mg ha 1 which was 64 of total soc stock at the steady state with c input of 1 30 mg c ha 1 y 1 in the alfisol at the palampur site iom pool was 39 35 mg ha 1 which was 97 of the total c stock with c input of 0 20 mg c ha 1 y 1 in the inceptisol at the ludhiana site iom pool was fixed at 11 55 mg ha 1 which was 86 of the soc stock with c input of 0 32 mg c ha 1 y 1 the model was parameterized with these iom pools soc pools and c inputs at steady state table 2 initial conditions pools of iom and the other four pools were obtained for each soil type as described in table 2 in the vertisol at the jabalpur site the soc stock in the beginning of the study 1972 was 33 5 mg ha 1 at 0 30 cm depth observed soc stock 0 30 cm depth in the treatment of nil fertilization was almost constant even after 38 years whereas in the npk and npk fym treatments soc stock increased over time fig 2 the highest soc stock was in the treatment of npk fym followed by npk treatment after 38 years soc stocks increased by 20 and 46 in the npk and the npk fym treatments respectively the modelled soc stocks in the 0 30 cm soil layer were similar to the observed values the fit of the model to the measured points for soc was good for npk r2 0 78 and npk fym r2 0 85 with rmse of 1 9 2 5 and 1 9 mg c ha 1 respectively in the alfisol at the palampur site the initial soc stock was 40 50 mg ha 1 the observed soc stock to the depth of 30 cm was almost unchanged even after 38 years in the treatment of nil fertilization whereas it was increased by 12 and 30 in the treatments of npk and npk fym fig 3 the simulated soc stock trend in 0 30 cm of soil layer corresponded well with the observed value in the nil fertilization treatment rmse 1 1 mg ha 1 for the npk treatment simulated soc stock also corresponded well with the observed value with rmse of 0 9 mg ha 1 r2 0 78 however the simulated soc stock for the npk fym treatment was slightly overestimated in comparison to the observed value rmse 2 3 mg ha 1 r2 0 53 in the inceptisol at the ludhiana site initial soc stock in the 0 30 cm soil layer was 13 67 mg ha 1 at the end of 38 years observed soc stock was increased to 17 37 mg ha 1 an increase of 27 in the soc stock even under the nil fertilization treatment fig 4 similarly observed soc stock increased by 61 and 107 under npk and npk fym treatments respectively the simulated soc stock in the 0 30 cm soil layer was matched well with the observed value in nil fertilization treatment rmse 1 4 mg ha 1 r2 0 77 for the npk and npk fym treatments simulated value of soc stocks was slightly overestimated in comparison to the observed value however there was a good correlation between the observed and predicted soc stock in the 0 30 cm soil layer under the npk rmse 2 7 mg ha 1 r2 0 84 and the npk fym rmse 3 1 mg ha 1 r2 0 91 treatments after parameterization rothc 26 3 was run for a period of 200 years to determine the steady state c maximum attainable c under the treatments of nil fertilization npk and npk fym at all the three sites fig 5 table 4 it was observed that in the vertisol at the jabalpur site steady state soc stocks of 29 0 41 0 and 60 0 mg ha 1 will reach after 55 48 and 108 years in the nil fertilization npk and npk fym respectively in the alfisol at the palampur site the soc stock 40 6 mg ha 1 in the nil fertilization treatment was already at steady state in the npk and npk fym treatments soc stocks of 49 0 and 57 mg ha 1 will reach steady state after 40 and 62 years respectively in the inceptisol at the ludhiana site soc stocks of 15 9 26 3 and 37 6 mg ha 1 in the nil fertilization npk and npk fym treatments will reach steady state after 44 95 and 116 years respectively 4 discussion the amount of soc stock is controlled primarily by c input through net primary production and c loss through decomposition simulation accuracy of global bio geochemical c model depends on the initial c content of soil and their relative distribution of soil c pools the availability of reliable measurements of total soc stock may not be sufficient to properly initialize soil c models here an effort was made to parameterize the rothc model for simulation in three major soil orders vertisols alfisols and inceptisols using data set of ltfe of india rothc model provides flexibility to simulate soil c turnover with user estimates of c input and partitioning of soil c in different pools several studies have demonstrated that rothc successfully simulated soil c dynamics under different soil and climatic conditions liu et al 2009 mishra et al 2019 senapati et al 2014 guo et al 2007 ludwig et al 2010 li et al 2016 2007 kamoni et al 2007 this demonstrates that rothc could provide an estimate of soil c dynamics in arable soil and could be used as a tool to decide management intervention for sequestering c in soil grain yields in the treatments without fertilization were low for the crops soybean maize and wheat at all the three sites the yield of a crop was markedly improved with application of npk and npk fym availability of nutrients is generally constrained in nil fertilization treatment in long term experiments due to fertility depletion which adversely affects crop growth and reduces productivity singh et al 2007 jagadamma et al 2008 jha et al 2014b response to chemical fertilization and organic manure application could be attributed to increased availability of plant nutrients in soil for growth and development of crops also application of balanced fertilization influences yield of crops by increasing the above and below ground biomass due to the supply of plant nutrients in adequate quantities consequently it resulted in increase in the som stock mcnair bostick et al 2007 through an increase in amount of belowground biomass in our study we run the model in forward mode we computed c inputs using bolinder et al 2007 approach keel et al 2017 reported that large uncertainty in modeled soil c is attributed solely to the allometric equation used to estimate the soil c inputs according to them the comparison to measured and simulated c stocks is the option to evaluate the reliability of allometric equations based on this assumption they concluded that the bolinder et al 2007 equation is the most appropriate to estimate soil c inputs c input is one of the most important driving variables for predicting the net rate of soc changes bolinder et al 2006 it is well documented that better predictions of model were achieved by using an empirically derived regression equation between crop yields and residue input ludwig et al 2007 2010 here we used equation of bolinder et al 2007 for computation of belowground c input as it also takes into account the rhizodeposits c table 1 in general c input to soil followed similar trend as of crop yield at all the three sites application of npk and npk fym considerably increased c input to soil the annual c inputs averaged across all the crops and treatments ranged from 0 21 to 4 01 mg c ha 1 year 1 it was the lowest in the nil fertilization treatment and the highest in the npk fym treatment mostly initialization of rothc model involves running the model until a steady state spin up run is reached and when the soc pools are stabilized initially we also attempted similar approach to parameterize the model however the model simulated soc stocks could not match with the observed data data not shown in the present investigation we did not use falloon et al 1998 approach for estimation of iom generally if no radiocarbon measurements are available iom pool is set using the equation of falloon et al 1998 which is a very rough estimate as well as incorrect conceptually ludwig et al 2010 the inert or passive pool fraction does not change as a result of change in management and climate thus the stock of total soc should not change either if the falloon equation had a strict validity ludwig et al 2010 furthermore for parameterization of rothc model skjemstad et al 2004 and zimmermann et al 2007 used experimental fractionation approach for an estimation of the pools the experimental fractionation is not well established and several uncertainties are associated with it we followed a different approach here we optimized the iom pool using the c input of nil fertilization treatment depending upon the change in soc concentration over time in the nil fertilization treatment the c input was tuned increased decreased unchanged for a steady state condition for a particular site as the c input at steady state is completely unknown fig 1 hence we changed optimized annual c input along with the iom pool iteratively to match simulated soc stocks with the observed soc stocks at steady state i e before the start of the experiment accordingly c inputs of 1 3 0 2 0 32 mg ha 1 y 1 and the iom pools of 21 75 39 35 and 11 55 mg ha 1 at steady state were fixed for the jabalpur palampur and ludhiana sites respectively similar approach of optimized c inputs was used by smith et al 1997 and guo et al 2007 nemo et al 2017 found that adjusting the total soc stock at steady state to the observed soc stock showed less variation in the individual soc pools and total soc stock likewise ludwig et al 2010 matched observed soc stocks with simulated soc stocks using similar approach in quzhou county of china in our work the iom pool contributed from 64 to 97 of the total soc stock at the three ltfe sites such high percentage of iom pool indicates that soc stocks of the soils were close to a minimum threshold value before the start of the experimentation after parameterization of the model input parameters we modelled soc stocks of the nil fertilization npk and npk fym treatments of three long term fertilizer experiments of india rothc successfully captured the trend of c stocks at all the three sites the model simulated soc stock matched well with the measured soc stock in the nil fertilization and npk treatments the agreement between the modelled and measured data was satisfactory rmse value for ltfe sites ranged from 2 to 14 literature data of rmse values in long term experiments with rothc model are reported in the range of 2 30 smith et al 1997 falloon smith 2002 guo et al 2007 therefore our rmse values were within this range at the ludhiana site the model slightly overestimated soc stocks in the npk fym treatment this overestimation of soc stock by rothc in the npk fym treatment might be due to the overestimation of the c inputs or inaccurate dpm rpm ratio used in the model senapati et al 2014 another reason could be the estimates of c concentration and moisture content of fym although it was reported that fym was applied on dry weight basis it may be possible that c contributed through fym was lower than the computed amount probably due to higher moisture content or lower c concentration an overestimation of soil c input could build up soc stock and thus provides the model overestimates of soc stock in the nil fertilization treatment at the palampur site soc stock in the alfisol remained at a steady state whereas it increased in the inceptisol at the ludhiana site at the jabalpur site soc stock of the nil fertilization treatment declined at a very slow rate yang et al 2003 also reported that imbalanced fertilization fails to maintain soc levels under conditions of conventional management system in treatments where no aboveground crop residues are returned to the soil at all the three sites long term application of npk or npk fym significantly increased the soc stocks build up of soc stocks under balanced fertilization and npk fym has also been reported by others bharadwaj and omanwar 1994 schjonning et al 1994 hati et al 2008 soc stock was increased by 20 12 and 61 for the treatments of npk over the initial soc stock at the jabalpur palampur and ludhiana sites respectively whereas it was increased by 46 30 and 107 over the initial value for the treatment of npk fym at the jabalpur palampur and ludhiana sites respectively similar observations were made by manna et al 2005 who also reported that soc sequestration rate was higher in vertisols followed by inceptisols and alfisols where fym was applied along with npk fertilizers the results corroborated that application of organic manure has pronounced effect on soc maintenance and accumulation in cropping systems this is in accordance with the results obtained from long term experiments kanchikerimath and singh 2001 rudrappa et al 2006 in the present study the soc stock under different climatic conditions will reach a steady state between 40 and 108 years ipcc 2003 2006 used empirical approach and projected net soc stock changes over a 20 year period although this may take much longer even more than 100 years poulton et al 2018 steady state soc stocks could be achieved ranging from 20 to more than 100 years qin and huang 2010 the difference in time to attain the steady state depends on the interaction between climatic factors soil type and the combination of multiple management practices 5 conclusions rothc 26 3 can be successfully parameterized to predict trend of soc stocks and adequately simulated the change in soc storage under indian climatic soil and management conditions optimization of annual c input along with iom pool iteratively changed is essential to match simulated soc stocks with observed soc stocks rothc successfully captured the trend of c stocks for the treatments of nil fertilization npk and npk fym in the three soils vertisol inceotisol and alfisol at the three sites in the long term experiments in india however there is a need to test the rothc 26 3 under the practice of conservation agriculture particularly in no till system with variable amounts of residue retention credit authorship contribution

methodology is given by reichstein et al 2005 finally nee was partitioned into ecosystem respiration and gppeddy 3 results 3 1 intra annual trends in gpp of the study site the eddy covariance observations showed that gppeddy was highest in october owing to a sufficient supply of moisture and light for photosynthesis fig 5 hourly variation in nee indicates that the maximum photosynthetic occurs between 011 00 a m to 02 00 p m on the clear sunny day of october gppeddy was used to validate the gpp estimated through different methods e g gppsif760 gppsiftoc gpplue and gppmodis mod17 running et al 2006 3 2 performance of luef model daily averaged gpp of different months showed the maximum value for october and minimum for the may month similar to gppeddy fig 6 gpplue was lower than gppsif760 gppsiftoc gppsif760 was observed to greater than gppsiftoc and gppeddy gppsiftoc estimate was closed to gppeddy for all months however gppsiftoc slightly underestimate the gpp for may month and overestimate for the october and december month linked to phenology and canopy development of study area monthly gppsiftoc was closely related to gppeddy with r2 0 91 p 0 05 with rmse 29 24 gc m 2 month 1 fig 7 gppsif760 also linearly related to gppeddy r2 0 89 p 0 05 but overestimated the gpp with rmse 292 30 gc m 2 month 1 gpp estimated by fapar i e gpplue is well correlated to gppeddy with r2 0 79 p 0 05 and rmse 96 25 gc m 2 month 1 however gppmodis underestimates the gpp with a non significant correlation to gppeddy for all the months with r2 0 36 p 0 05 and rmse 188 96 gc m 2 month 1 the value for gppsif760 was high owing to the higher value for sif760 than siftoc for all the months 3 3 inter relationship between ccc fapar vis sif and gpp gppsif gpplue monthly fapar showed the highest value for october month and lowest for may fig 8 moreover seasonal observations showed that fapars underestimates 0 4 october 14 may the fapar than faparo for the year 2017 yet both were well correlated with r2 0 7 with p 0 05 zhang et al 2014 found that the fapar estimated from the rt model strongly correlated to gpp than the fapar from vis gppsif was observed to be significantly p 0 05 correlated with ccc sif and fapar with averaged r2 0 67 p 0 05 fig 9 vis were well correlated with gppsif except for mcari and ndvi r2 0 5 p 0 05 for all the seas however sif shows a significant correlation with rndvi and mtci r2 0 7 p 0 05 vi s with red edge bands perform better than ndvi however h yang et al 2017 reported that ndvi demonstrated a greater correlation with gppsif 3 4 seasonal dynamics of sif and gppsif of deciduous forests the canopy level sif and gppsif760 of tropical deciduous mixed forests of bhakhra range of tcfd exhibit maximum photosynthetic activity during the post monsoon october and lowest in the summer may fig 10 photosynthetic activity during winter december was reduced due to the initiation of leaf fall in the study area the may month marked as the transition period of leaf exchange in the study area during the may month vegetation emitted the intermediate to low sif with low fapar however sif is still emitted significantly in low elevation areas occupied by poplar species populus deltoides which attain high foliage by the may month in the study area the december month indicates a declining trend of gpp owing to leaf senescence however some plantation blocks with evergreen canopies were synthesizing co2 during the december month the warm climatic conditions and high foliage of october month offered maximum vegetation photosynthetic activity and therefore the highest sif response and maximum gppsif the variability in gpp was observed depending upon the species and age of different plantations but the lowest variability was observed during the post monsoon month 4 discussion photosynthesis is initiated by absorption of solar light i e photon to produced energy i e atp produced energy is carried forward to co2 fixing enzymes e g vcmax collatz et al 1991 through ps i ii of chlorophyll chl govindjee 2004b specifically an antenna molecule of chl is responsible for trapping the photon govindjee 1995 thus sif as a product of absorbed photons is directly linked to ccc however sif is non linearly related to ccc due to reabsorption of chf and light limited photosynthesis efficiency of chl gitelson et al 1998 miao et al 2018 genty et al 1989 showed that the quantum yield of ps ii measured through the chf variable is linearly related and co2 assimilation the amount of chf and co2 assimilation primarily rely on фf and lue respectively in lue model fapar and par quantify the amount of solar light interacted to green vegetation and actual lue expressed the assimilation rate of co2 per absorbed solar energy in luef model sif provides the photosynthesis response of green vegetation in proportion of absorbed solar energy and photosynthesis active that will quantified by apportioning фf in lue guanter et al 2014 damm et al 2010 showed that the luepam estimated through fluorometer is equivalent to lue estimated from gaseous exchange method at leaf level he also measured фf as a ratio of sif and apar represents the small fraction of total chf at canopy scale measured фf through sif associated with the narrow sif retrieval window i e wavelength of the solar spectrum like 712 713 nm 748 757 nm 775 785 nm for gome 2 kooreman et al 2018 and 757 nm 771 nm for oco 2 wei et al 2018 whereas фf estimated through pam fluorometer represents the total chf emitted within the range of 700 750 nm wavelength from a leaf apar is another important variable used in the lue model to quantify the light interacted with foliage at the canopy scale however the quantification of spatial apar is quite hard as previously discussed results indicate the seasonal discrepancies 0 4 14 in fapar measurements through a different algorithm similar to the findings of putzenlechner et al 2019 october month in the study area shows minimum discrepancies with maximum foliage cover the homogeneous and closed canopy provides better estimates of fapar by eliminating the effects of background soil reflectance weiss and baret 2016 however we observed that fapar is well correlated with simulated sif scope model simulates the sif and photosynthesis rate pn at the canopy scale tol et al 2014 though simulated pn is less susceptible to chlorophyll content less than 5 μgcm 2 koffi et al 2015b luef model addressed the role of фf and sif through the estimates of co2 exchange i e ε 0 in gpp estimation it also overcomes the uncertainty about the relationship between simulated sif and pn at the canopy level using the lue model instead of the rt model i e scope gpp i e gppsif760 and gppsiftoc estimated through the luef model captured better seasonal variability than the lue model and gppmodis our findings indicate that gppsiftoc and gppsif760 are closer to gppeddy than gppsif740 gppmodis and gpplue moreover gppsif760 and gppsiftoc linearly correlated to gppeddy h yang et al 2017 also showed that gpp estimated through sif and eddy covariance tower data was in a good correlation at the landscape level our results confirmed that gppsif760 represents the seasonal gppeddy of the tropical deciduous forests damm et al 2015 also found that gppsif760 is potentially linked to gpp at the canopy level however gpplue underestimated the gpp than gppsif760 as sif recorded at the active phase of photosynthetic molecules earlier studies established that gpp estimated by sif was higher than 50 gpp estimated by other productivity assessment models guanter et al 2014 yang et al 2015 wood et al 2017 wieneke et al 2018 sensitive analysis of the scope model by verrelst et al 2015 showed that sif and gpp were sensitive to the amount of chlorophyll content cab lai and maximum carboxylation rate vcmax leaf equivalent water thickness cw and leaf dry mass cdm the cab lai cw and cdm were directly estimated from the field however the maximum carboxylation rate vcmax is linked to enzymatic activity and estimated as a function of electron transport rate etr guan et al 2016 successfully estimated gpp using electron transport rate etr as a function of sif the quantum yield of photosynthesis and fluorescence additionally fapar play an important role in the lue model and among one of the reasons for the underestimation of gpplue and gppmodis however previous studies showed that sif is linearly correlated to gppmodis sinha et al 2017 sun et al 2018 we also observed a low linear correlation between vis and photosynthetic activities sif gppsif possibly owing to the existence of nonlinear relation as well most vis are susceptible to saturation effects 4 1 study implications for improved assessment of gpp of tropical forests estimating the gross primary productivity gpp of terrestrial ecosystems attracts researchers as it has been one of the foci of global climate change studies chen et al 1999 gpp indicates the growth status of vegetation in a variable ecosystem it provides information about carbon storage by land ecosystems and helps to manage renewable biological resources defining land use policies and sink of atmospheric co2 understanding the distribution of gpp in different forest types is essential for improving terrestrial carbon estimation in different carbon pools variable gpp in response to climatic factors e g temperature precipitation and nutrients will be influencing the amount of terrestrial carbon sink and thus co2 concentration in the atmosphere hyvönen et al 2007 generally sif is established as a potential measure of gpp and thus co2 uptake by vegetation however the application of sif for a direct measure of gpp is one of the less studies topics sif provides instant photosynthetic activity and helps in monitoring the real time growth of vegetation this study advances our understanding of the co2 sequestration by tropical forest ecosystems with contrasting phenology 5 conclusion the connection between the sif and the gpp has already been demonstrated the spatial distribution of photosynthetic activity is shown by the gppsif map these findings indicate that the gppsif estimated through simulated sif and фf is a potential estimate of gppeddy estimated from the eddy covariance tower however the simulated spatial sif depends on the variability captured by ccc but it can be easily replaced by using available spatial space borne airborne sif we emphasize the luef model for studying the gpp dynamics for the tropical mixed species deciduous forests our study highlighted the ability of the pam fluorometer to capture фf of chf at the leaf level фf proved a potential indicator of lue of chf sif also provides an estimate of foliage interacted with solar energy further there is a need to couple the eddy covariance tower measurements and fine resolution satellite air borne sif observations in vegetation productivity

24628,reliable estimation of forest carbon fluxes in space and time is a major challenge sun induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif has been found closely linked to vegetation photosynthetic activity

extent between 10 and 20 latitudes in the northern and southern hemispheres quigley and platt 2003 in india the tropical deciduous forests account for about 13 percent of the total forest cover reddy et al 2015 they regulate intra annual variations in the terrestrial and atmospheric carbon budget by adding litter and humus as soil carbon through the decay of shaded leaves periodically and respiration of living cells respectively forest survey of india fsi 2017 precise estimation of the co2 flux is therefore crucial to determine the carbon sequestration potential of these forests and the variability caused in co2 flux due to environmental changes the gross primary productivity gpp is defined as the amount of carbon fixed by the plants during photosynthesis gpp accounts for the maximum amount of co2 exchange by the terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere ciais et al 2014 the precise quantification of gpp at the landscape level is however challenging as there is no direct measurement technique beyond the leaf level forest productivity is primarily estimated using the data gathered through temporal forest inventories and established empirical allometric equations in terms of biomass gough 2011 the eddy covariance ec technique can precisely measure co2 flux at the ecosystem level ec technique consistently measures the co2 flux between vegetation and atmosphere

than gppsif760 gppsiftoc gppsif760 was observed to greater than gppsiftoc and gppeddy gppsiftoc estimate was closed to gppeddy for all months however gppsiftoc slightly underestimate the gpp for may

month 1 the value for gppsif760 was high owing to the higher value for sif760 than siftoc for all the months 3 3 inter relationship between ccc fapar vis sif and gpp gppsif gpplue monthly fapar showed the highest value for october month and lowest for may fig 8 moreover seasonal observations showed that fapars underestimates 0 4 october 14 may the fapar than faparo for the year 2017 yet both were well correlated with r2 0 7 with p 0 05 zhang et al 2014 found that the fapar estimated from the rt model strongly correlated to gpp than the fapar from vis gppsif was observed to be significantly p 0

dynamics of sif and gppsif of deciduous forests the canopy level sif and gppsif760 of tropical deciduous mixed forests of bhakhra range of tcfd exhibit maximum photosynthetic activity during the post monsoon october and lowest in the summer may fig 10 photosynthetic activity during winter december was reduced due to the initiation of leaf fall in the study area the may month marked as the transition period of leaf exchange in the study area during the may month vegetation emitted the intermediate to low sif with low fapar however sif is still emitted significantly in low elevation areas occupied by poplar species populus deltoides which attain high foliage by the may month in the study area the december month indicates a declining trend of gpp owing to leaf senescence however some plantation blocks with evergreen canopies were synthesizing co2 during the december month the warm climatic conditions and high foliage of october month offered maximum vegetation photosynthetic activity and therefore the highest sif response and maximum gppsif the variability in gpp was observed depending upon the species and age of different plantations but the lowest variability was observed during the post monsoon month 4 discussion photosynthesis is initiated by absorption of solar light i e photon to produced energy i e atp produced energy is carried forward to co2 fixing enzymes e g vcmax collatz et al 1991 through ps i ii of chlorophyll chl govindjee 2004b specifically an antenna molecule of chl is responsible for trapping the photon govindjee 1995 thus sif as a product of absorbed photons is directly linked to ccc however sif is non linearly related to ccc due to reabsorption of chf and light limited photosynthesis efficiency of chl gitelson et al 1998 miao et al 2018 genty et al 1989 showed that the quantum yield of ps ii measured through the chf variable is linearly related and co2 assimilation the amount of chf and co2 assimilation primarily rely on фf and lue respectively in lue model fapar and par quantify the amount of solar light interacted to green vegetation and actual lue expressed the assimilation rate of co2 per absorbed solar energy in luef model sif provides the photosynthesis response of green vegetation in proportion of absorbed solar energy and photosynthesis active that will quantified by apportioning фf in lue guanter et al 2014 damm et al 2010 showed that the luepam estimated through fluorometer is equivalent to lue estimated from gaseous exchange method at leaf level he also measured фf as a ratio of sif and apar represents the small fraction of total chf at canopy scale measured фf through sif associated with the narrow sif retrieval window i e wavelength of the solar spectrum like 712 713 nm 748 757 nm 775 785 nm for gome 2 kooreman et al 2018 and 757 nm 771 nm for oco 2 wei et al 2018 whereas фf estimated through pam fluorometer represents the total chf emitted within the range of 700 750 nm wavelength from a leaf apar is another important variable used in the lue model to quantify the light interacted with foliage at the canopy scale however the quantification of spatial apar is quite hard as previously discussed results indicate the seasonal discrepancies 0 4 14 in fapar measurements through a different algorithm similar to the findings of putzenlechner et al 2019 october month in the study area shows minimum discrepancies with maximum foliage cover the homogeneous and closed canopy provides better estimates of fapar by eliminating the effects of background soil reflectance weiss and baret 2016 however we observed that fapar is well correlated with simulated sif scope model simulates the sif and photosynthesis rate pn at the canopy scale tol et al 2014 though simulated pn is less susceptible to chlorophyll content less than 5 μgcm 2 koffi et al 2015b luef model addressed the role of фf and sif through the estimates of co2 exchange i e ε 0 in gpp estimation it also overcomes the uncertainty about the relationship between simulated sif and pn at the canopy level using the lue model instead of the rt model i e scope gpp i e gppsif760 and gppsiftoc estimated through the luef model captured better seasonal variability than the lue model and gppmodis our findings indicate that gppsiftoc and gppsif760 are closer to gppeddy than gppsif740 gppmodis and gpplue moreover gppsif760 and gppsiftoc linearly correlated to gppeddy h yang et al 2017 also showed that gpp estimated through sif and eddy covariance tower data was in a good correlation at the landscape level our results confirmed that gppsif760 represents the seasonal gppeddy of the tropical deciduous forests damm et al 2015 also found that gppsif760 is potentially linked to gpp at the canopy level however gpplue underestimated the gpp than gppsif760 as sif recorded at the active phase of photosynthetic molecules earlier studies established that gpp estimated by sif was higher than 50 gpp estimated by other productivity assessment models guanter et al 2014 yang et al 2015 wood et al 2017 wieneke et al 2018 sensitive analysis of the scope model by verrelst et al 2015 showed that sif and gpp were sensitive to the amount of chlorophyll content cab lai and maximum carboxylation rate vcmax leaf equivalent water thickness cw and leaf dry mass cdm the cab lai cw and cdm were directly estimated from the field however the maximum carboxylation rate vcmax is linked to enzymatic activity and estimated as a function of electron transport rate etr guan et al 2016 successfully estimated gpp using electron transport rate etr as a function of sif the quantum yield of photosynthesis and fluorescence additionally fapar play an important role in the lue model and among one of the reasons for the underestimation of gpplue and gppmodis however previous studies showed that sif is linearly correlated to gppmodis sinha et al 2017 sun et al 2018 we also observed a low linear correlation between vis and photosynthetic activities sif gppsif possibly owing to the existence of nonlinear relation as well most vis are susceptible to saturation effects 4 1 study implications for improved assessment of gpp of tropical forests estimating the gross primary productivity gpp of terrestrial ecosystems attracts researchers as it has been one of the foci of global climate change studies chen et al 1999 gpp indicates the growth status of vegetation in a variable ecosystem it provides information about carbon storage by land ecosystems and helps to manage renewable biological resources defining land use policies and sink of atmospheric co2 understanding the distribution of gpp in different forest types is essential for improving terrestrial carbon estimation in different carbon pools variable gpp in response to climatic factors e g temperature precipitation and nutrients will be influencing the amount of terrestrial carbon sink and thus co2 concentration in the atmosphere hyvönen et al 2007 generally sif is established as a potential measure of gpp and thus co2 uptake by vegetation however the application of sif for a direct measure of gpp is one of the less studies topics sif provides instant photosynthetic activity and helps in monitoring the real time growth of vegetation this study advances our understanding of the co2 sequestration by tropical forest ecosystems with contrasting phenology 5 conclusion the connection between the sif and the gpp has already been demonstrated the spatial distribution of photosynthetic activity is shown by the gppsif map these findings indicate that the gppsif estimated through simulated sif and фf is a potential estimate of gppeddy estimated from the eddy covariance tower however the simulated spatial sif depends on the variability captured by ccc but it can be easily replaced by using available spatial space borne airborne sif we emphasize the luef model for studying the gpp dynamics for the tropical mixed species deciduous forests our study highlighted the ability of the pam fluorometer to capture фf of chf at the leaf level фf proved a potential indicator of lue of chf sif also provides an estimate of foliage interacted with solar energy further there is a need to couple the eddy covariance tower measurements and fine resolution satellite air borne sif observations in vegetation productivity research currently oco 2 offers relatively fine resolution gridded information but does not offer continuous coverage for the landscape studies a dedicated satellite mission named fluorescence explorer flex planned by esa may provide better resolution sif information sun et al 2017 credit author statement sanjiv k sinha methodology software data curation writing original draft preparation

24629,renewal of old communities is an inevitable process in urban development old community renewal brings multiple benefits to communities and their residents however existing studies on the benefits of old community renewal usually focuses on single aspects such as energy savings or property value increase an integrated framework that provides a holistic assessment of community renewal benefits is missing to address this limitation this paper proposed an emergy based method to quantitatively assess the benefits systematically from economic social and environmental perspectives based on the emergy theory the proposed method coverts various input and output during community renewal process into one standard unit the solar emjoule sej the method was tested in a case study of a community renewal project in nanjing china it was found that the emergy input in the case study was 3 46e 19 sej while the output from the renewal activity is 1 82e 19 sej the main benefit of old community renewal of the case study came from the maintenance minimizing and appreciation of fixed asset only 1 04 of total benefits of community renewal were social and environmental benefits this study provides an integrated quantitative approach for benefits evaluation in community renewal projects decision makers could use the emergy analysis to conduct holistic assessment of community renewal activities and make informed decisions regarding old community renewal keywords old community renewal emergy analysis benefits evaluation 1 introduction old community renewal refers to communities that have been built for a long time and have architectural environmental or management problems zhou and zhang 2015 qiu 2019 among global urban renewal cases china has great potential to exploit the diverse benefits in old community renewal due to its large amount of old community buildings and rapid urbanization trend güneralp et al 2017 old community renewal has become a long term and continuous plan in china it has been estimated by the chinese government that more than 160 000 old communities in different provinces of china need renewal mohurd 2019 by 2020 the total size of renewal projects would be about 4 billion square meters mohurd 2019 these projects will ultimately benefit more than 42 million households mohurd 2019 it has been estimated that the chinese government will invest about 4 trillion yuan in total for the nationwide old community renewal activities starting from 2019 qiu 2019 despite the significant financial investment requirement old community renewal could bring huge social ecologic and economic benefits existing studies have investigated the impacts and benefits of old community renewal at regional and city levels tanguay et al 2010 wang et al 2014 zheng et al 2017 some researchers have explored economic benefits of community renewal such as lower energy cost and new business opportunities ferreira and almeida 2015 zhao et al 2018 others have focused on social and environmental benefits such as employment creation increased comfort and annual carbon uptake azizi et al 2020 kim 2017 despite the efforts there are still many unsolved questions regarding old community renewal specifically there lacks an integrated approach to quantify the community level value of old community renewal considering the resource needs and various aspects of its benefits such comprehensive and quantifiable evaluation method is critical to assess the renewal plans and activities in a holistic way and make informed decisions accordingly for decision makers vega azamar et al 2015 giannetti et al 2017 to address this knowledge gap this study aims to develop an emergy based methodology for evaluating old community renewal considering its benefits from multiple perspectives by converting different inputs and benefits into emergy as a unified energy measurement the emergy analysis ema could assess different emergy flows involved in the renewal projects of old communities following an integrated framework eventually the objective of this study is to provide a quantitative evaluation method for both the public and private house owners to optimize their management and investment plans in order to increase the overall net benefits from community renewal projects the structure of this paper is arranged as follows in section 2 literature review on community renewal as well as emergy analysis and its applications are provided in section 3 the proposed emergy analysis methodology for old community renewal assessment is presented in section 4 the proposed method is demonstrated in a case study of an old community renewal project in nanjing china finally discussion and implication are presented in section 5 2 literature review 2 1 old community renewal community is traditionally defined as a physical space where people live the scale of community can range from 1 5 km2 to 5 5 km2 in china zhang 1997 based on other researchers communities can go beyond physical space as the locus of social service vigilante 1976 mcmillan and chavis 1986 identified four elements of sense of community as membership influence reinforcement and shared emotional connection due to the age of the buildings and facilities many communities have lost basic functions which have been required for modern living mohurd 2019 insufficient parking spaces around old community is a common problem in communities with poor living conditions moreover communities with absence of basic services or supporting facilities can also be regarded as old communities huang and sun 2016 wang et al 2013 yu et al 2014 the main purpose of the renewal of the old community is to improve the comfort of the original residential living environment and make up for the damage and deficiency caused by early design long time use inappropriate management etc li and meng 2013 all these problems have indicated that old community renewal needs large amount of external materials fuel electricity water and other resources to promote modern production and entertainment activities because building itself cannot promote as the environment lee and braham 2017 scholars defined the renewal program of these old communities as a collective effort between public private and non profit agencies to address developing problems in communities alonso et al 2019 old community renewal in china is mainly focused on the connection between the individual and the public including public space improvement green area reconstruction and property management improvement cai et al 2017 gu et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 the construction period of community renewal usually takes 6 15 months depending on the scale of the community qiu 2019 many researchers have evaluated the benefits of old community renewal from different aspects as economic benefits social benefits energy saving etc azizi et al 2020 pikas et al 2020 wang et al 2015 the benefit assessment process is also constantly updated by introducing new evaluation models ferreira and almeida 2015 martinaitis 2004 zhao et al 2018 2 2 emergy analysis emergy analysis is an energy centric system analysis method founded on the basis of thermodynamics general system theory and systems ecology odum 1996 emergy is defined as the amount of energy contained to produce a product or service and accounted by a unified energy standard odum 1996 since the energy on the earth comes directly or indirectly from the sun solar emergy is applied as a standard unit called solar emjoule sej in emergy analysis different forms of energy involved in one system including energy inherent to goods or services need to be converted to the solar emergy unit by different transformities brown and ulgiati 1997 odum 1996 the transformity is the solar energy contained in a certain type of energy or substance per unit amaral et al 2016 ema applied studies usually follow the procedure presented by odum 1996 which could be used to evaluate emergy performance of region level or bigger scale and been applied globally almeida et al 2010 brown and ulgiati 2016 vega azamar et al 2015 some innovative indicators are proposed for emergy analysis like net emergy surplus concept and an emergy based urban ecosystem health index lei et al 2008 liu et al 2009 emergy analysis has a wide range of application in studies for system assessment at different scales because of its unique capability in quantifying complex systems odum 1996 presented a procedure that evaluates emergy performance of nations and or regions with a case study in the united states of america at smaller scales emergy analysis were used in studies for urban metabolic patterns investigation and sustainability assessment fan and fang 2020 lei et al 2008 vega azamar et al 2015 zhang et al 2011 for example lee braham 2017 applied the ema to buildings on manhattan island and help to overcoming the scale and resolution mismatch between the macro level and micro level applying ema in building evaluation provides a holistic assessment of resources used in buildings and its energy flow meillau et al 2005 evaluated the emergy performance of a university building finding that about 95 of total emergy is from information pulselli et al 2007 assessed the housing sustainability by calculating the emergy of building manufacturing maintenance and usage these studies used ema as a useful tool to evaluate the performance of certain buildings or housing sustainability which proved the practicality of ema method in evaluations of buildings and in small scale regions however they neglect the benefits of these buildings brought to surrounding areas it is certain that the renewal activities can bring comprehensive benefits but many scholars have not made quantitative estimation for these benefits ferreira et al 2015 emergy analysis could be a promising tool in evaluating old community renewal activities community renewal activities involve many buildings which indicates that the application of ema on building performance could be expanded to renewal benefits evaluation study from lee braham 2017 has provide a good example to show the flexibility of ema in building evaluation the quantifiability and comparability of emergy analysis meet the need for quantified estimation for diverse benefits in old community renewal analysis emergy analysis of a community renewal activity accounts for all energy spent to produce its raw materials including wood concrete and many others as well as the energy taken in the labor equipment and service ema uses the transformity to covert different units into one standard the solar emjoule sej which allows direct comparison of different processes and products srinivasan and moe 2015 this inspired authors to propose an emergy based analysis method to quantify different benefits from old community renewal analysis 3 methodology an overall framework of the proposed emergy based old community renewal analysis is presented in fig 1 four modules are included in the proposed framework first it is required to draw an emergy diagram based on the flow of energy matter and money to form the inputs and outputs in the community renewal system second benefits from the renewal project need be recognized classified and elaborated third emergy calculation methods for benefits from different aspects need to be generated based on transformities finally the result of the study is presented as the quantified benefits in emergy analysis table and emergy indicators in the following sections each module is presented in detail 3 1 emergy based old community renewal model this paragraph proposes an emergy system diagram to show the paths of energy flow and material flow in the community renewal process the main components of the system include the community site community buildings community environment activities resources and residents external inputs of the system include sunlight wind rain materials equipment appliance labor services electricity gas water it is necessary to state that ema divides the input into renewable and non renewable resource the renewable resources conclude energy provided by sunlight rain and wind in local area the transformity for renewable resources required to take emergy baseline into consideration solar geothermal and gravitational potential provide a total emergy contribution to the geobiosphere of 12 0e 24 sej annually brown and ulgiati 2016 the non renewable emergy inputs of old community renewal are mainly based on the official project contracts from which the data of raw material equipment and energy is completely listed the calculations of renewable input are presented in appendix a which are based on the research from brown ulgiati 2016 all the transformity resources will be listed in final emergy analysis table and the conversion process listed in appendix b system boundaries and external resources are identified in a conceptual emergy diagram in fig 2 following the diagram rules proposed by odum 1996 the diagram describes resource inputs and flows in renewal activities in fig 2 community site presents as the basic frame to reflect the characteristics of location old communities are living spaces for residents where surrounding infrastructures such as supermarkets clinics schools etc have already developed to a certain degree renewal activities not only improve the community itself also drive the renewal of surrounding infrastructure or buildings making regional resources more concentrated and fixed improving the value of the location there are many other components in the community site and closely related to renewal activities this study would like to separate the community buildings as an independent component in community site due to that the renewal will be an investment mainly on the buildings in the site it is helpful to create a clear diagram to show the resources and work flowing into the renewed community other components are as follows 1 municipal lines road external envelop parking space are presented as one material tank in which energy and materials are stocked materials equipment labor services are external resources will flow into this tank through the public space renewal to renew the outdoor spaces and courts of the community 2 community green area provides places where carbon dioxide can be absorbed and oxygen be released during photosynthesis of plants green area can also collect rainfall and provide adsorption of dust most renewable resources flow into the community through the green area the area will be reconstructed to create a livable environment like roadside green area setting so the public space and community green area are interdependent parts in the renewal activity 3 security management services represents original functions of the community the old community faces many management problems because there are no extra money and labors for external services supply the renewal activity could be an opportunity for the community to improve the security and service level by introducing management company support and subsidies from local government can ensure the service quality more services will also affect the living cost of the original residents 4 public space renewal is one important process in the renewal activity it connects to all the outdoor space of the community roads in the community need to be repaved and repainted with the renewal of municipal lines some cables were hanging outside the external walls of the residential buildings which may cause safety incidents most cables will be set under the ground which also create a clear visual perception public space renewal could be the second biggest investment in the whole renewal activity 5 building maintenance is another important part in the renewal activity buildings in the renewal may stimulate the residents identification with the community and the willingness for long time residence some residents chose to renovate their own homes and purchased new furniture for further residence in the community there have been one research shown that aesthetics improvement adopting modern systems and extending living space can be the driving factors for house owners to conduct renovation projects for higher energy efficiency and living quality azizi et al 2020 6 the residents are represented as one hexagon tank it represents residents that live in the building and the number of residents in the community residents are core consumers and beneficiaries in the renewal activity the appreciation of fixed property and rent are two major economic benefits for residents from the renewal they also need to pay tax for the government and purchase services provided by the community 7 sunlight wind and rain are considered as renewable resources while electricity gas and water are nonrenewable resources in community renewal water use in renewal activities is different from regular house use a certain amount of water is used in material mix and site cleaning which does not enter to the civil water treatment system for recycling equipment and appliances conclude concrete mixer truck small generator water tank lighting devices etc labor and service concludes designing construction consulting audit etc equipment and appliances are estimated based on the money paid to purchase or rent them then labor and services are also estimated the same way constant energy inflows and materials are needed for maintenance equipment operation transport etc the main inputs are the materials equipment appliance labor services and consumption of electricity gas and water this component is the core of the old community renewal system which directly creates multi benefits for a community rain water sunlight can enter the process of photosynthesis and respiration in green area material equipment and applicant labor and service are needed to be combined and artificially processed for renewal activities the wastes from renewal also need to collect and transport which also be presented as a gray arrow 3 2 benefits recognition in old community renewal many scholars have investigated the benefits brought by community renewal table 1 summarizes the literature review results regarding the benefits of community renewal some of the literatures included in table 1 are not directly related to old community renewal however since old community can be considered as a part of the building environment system and ecosystem some of the benefits identified from industrial or ecosystem system improvement could also be applicable to old community renewal based on the literature review in table 1 the benefits of the old community renewal are identified and categorized into three categories economic benefits social benefits and environmental benefits table 2 provides a summary of all the benefits economic benefits are one vital benefit in renewal activities the appreciation of fixed asset can be considered as one significant benefit from renewal pikas et al 2020 since the appreciation of fixed assets only converts into currency when the transactions happened this study would like to refer the nominal rent to evaluation the benefit from the appreciation of fixed assets because for current residents the value of the house in the rental market is being used by themselves even after the renewal without any trade the renewal activity can attract more people to rent houses in the community due to the improvement of the environment and services housing agencies can take benefits from the increased rent with the renewal of the parking space the parking revenue can be a new benefit resource for the community although the parking benefits are mainly from the residents in the community but most of the parking revenue will be reused in the operation and management for the community itself the construct performance of the community buildings can be renewed and enhanced in other words residents can save more money on the annual maintenance due to the renewal activity the residential maintenance fund is set to prepare for the future maintenance of the buildings in the community the renewal has indirectly saved the money from the fund and could be considered as another economic benefit in the renewal activity social benefits from community renewal are difficult to evaluate since some benefits depending on user experience science research is an easily overlooked social benefit in community renewal it can bring realistic case for further research or regional plan which is important for future development of the community education and volunteer activity are great opportunities for residents to provide their contributions for the community environmental benefits are usually related to the green space and facilities in community green space is another inevitable part in most community renewal activities for example low impact development and sponge city project in china are expansions and enhancements for green space functions gu et al 2019 considering that the green area of urban communities is usually strictly limited some benefits appearing in large scale studies are not used in this study 3 3 quantification of old community renewal benefits this section will explain calculation method of the raw data that needs to be used in the benefit evaluation in this section all the benefits listed in table 2 will match a quantification method for the ema the main challenge of this method is to determine the transformity or unit energy value to obtain the transformity of resources all material and energy resources used to production must be considered and expressed in terms of emergy values therefore transformity is not fixed or unique for most resources in some cases it is difficult to directly calculate the unit emergy of a specific resource however unit emergy can be derived from other studies applying transformity needs to be valid under different conditions location or time this study applied this assumption to the emergy analysis of materials and energy in the community renewal to better understand the magnitude of possible errors literature references to select the currency emergy ratio of the province is adopted rather than national level value second this study artificially selects materials and energy from community renewal contracts with clear transformity reference for emergy analysis and the remaining materials are accumulated after economic cost then calculated by the conversion of the monetary emergy ratio referring to benefits listed in table 2 total emergy of benefits from community renewal activity emtb can be given by 1 e m t b e m e b e m s o i b e m e n r b where e m e b e m s o i b and e m e n r b are emergy values of the measurement categories e m

m p is the emergy value of parking revenue e m m m is the emergy value of minimizing maintenance e1 appreciation of fixed assets the renewal activities can provide improvement of the living environment for residents the value of assets in the renewed community will increase in the real estate market accordingly this study refers to the nominal rent calculation method to measure the benefits from the appreciation of fixed assets for current residents the renewed houses are rented to themselves the appreciation of fixed assets can be reflected from the living and usage in the house the rent can be obtained from real estate websites comparing the current rent with the rent before renewal the emergy value of appreciation of fixed assets ema is presented as 3 e m a r 1 r 0 n

this case study t r is the transformity of emergy per unit money sej cny e2 housing agency benefits the improvement of community could increase the number of fixed asset transactions which means the housing agency can exploit more benefits from old community renewal the emergy value of housing agency benefits emha is presented as 4 e m h a i 1 n s i p 1 i r t r where n is the number of houses for sale and leasing in one year after renewal which can be obtained from local real estate websites si is the size of each house in fixed asset transactions or house lease m2 p 1 i is average leasing

calculated as 5 e m p n p p p 365 t r where np is the number of parking spaces added in the community p p is the daily parking price for each car cny d car t r is the transformity of emergy per unit money sej cny e4 minimizing maintenance old communities have not set up residential maintenance funds residential maintenance funds refer to funds earmarked for the maintenance renewal and renovation of common residential parts and shared facilities and equipment after the expiration of the warranty period the renewal activity has provided an opportunity for the community to enhance the strength and functions of buildings this official renewal project needs to conduct comprehensive evaluation of the public space and building performance of the community in which the local government will participate in project supervision and inspection to ensure quality renewal activity can save the residential maintenance funds that were originally required to be paid by the owners of the old community in this study the calculation of the benefits of minimizing maintenance will refer to the official document published by the mohurd 1 1 http www mohurd gov cn fgjs jsbgz 200712 t20071228 159109 html which calculated as 6 e m m m p m a m 5 t r where p m is the average construction and installation cost cny m2 a m is the construction area of the community m2 5 is the coefficient of the

research old community renewal activities can provide data and documents for related researches some publications will take the renewal project as a case study which helps decision makers to understand the essential problems in old community emergy of science research is calculated based on the investment from the local government some research requests are listed on the official online bidding site relevant information and data can be collected from these websites or physical files the outcome of the investment should include the information about the studied community the emergy of

emergy value of dust holding e m r c is the emergy value of rainwater conservation en1 carbon sequestration and oxygen release community renewal usually brings more green space and thus can increase carbon sequestration and oxygen release according to the photosynthesis and respiration equations the ecosystem needs 1 63 g co2 to produce 1 g dry matter and release 1 19 g o2 at the same time it means that for every 1 g of co2 fixed in the plant 0 73 g of o2 will be released ecosystem carbon sequestration e m c o 2 is mainly calculated by co2 emissions or removals which can be expressed as a calculation formula 11 e m c o 2 n p p c f s 44 12 t r c o 2 the emergy of released oxygen e m o 2 from renewed green space is calculated as 12 e m o 2 n p p c f s 44 12 0 73 t r o 2 where npp gc m 2

quantification of community renewal benefits from economic social and environmental aspects indicators can be generated to evaluate the performance of old community renewal table 3 provides a list of these indicators with brief descriptions and calculation methods for example brown and ulgiati 1997 proposed an index for evaluating the sustainable development of urban ecosystems environmental sustainability index esi which is widely used in the research of the sustainability evaluation these indicators will be used for evaluation of community renewal to measure the efficiency of emergy used in the renewal process all the economic benefits social benefits and environmental benefits will adopt some indicators from esi 4 case study in the following sections an old community renewal project will be studied the proposed benefits evaluation method was implemented in a case study of an old community renewal project in nanjing china benefits recognized above and emergy quantification method will be adopted in case study the result of emergy analysis and emergy indicators will presented in form of tables to show the energy use and benefits in renewal activities 4 1 basic information of xianghe community the community measured in this study is located at qixia district nanjing jiangsu province china there are two universities on the east and west sides and the surrounding communities are concentrated in the northwest and southeast the size of the community is 102 000 m2s with a total of fourteen 18 story high rise buildings there are about 3013 residents living in this 2010 established community more detailed information of xianghe community is shown in table 4 one important reason for the selection of xianghe community is that it is a typical high rise residential community in china in high rise residential buildings the service life of various equipment and facilities are mostly within 30 years which is more prone to problems such as aging and higher maintenance costs lin and hu 2003 compared with ordinary residential buildings the replacement and maintenance costs of these equipment are more expensive although this community is not very old in age due to the lack of good planning and design the community faced a lot of problems before renewal as shown in fig 3 asphalt roads in the community were damaged and dirty where motor vehicles parked in disorder painted parking space could not meet the increasing parking demand in the community residential buildings are generally old and cracked which affects the appearance and comfort of use to address these longstanding problems community renewal activities began in june 2018 and ends in january 2019 according to the renewal contractors the renewal content was divided into six categories architecture landscape electrical appliances intelligent community green space and water supply and drainage the renewal of the building also includes the demolition of the original illegal building the content of landscape and greening are different landscape includes the content of road works and structure expansion of green space in the community green space improvement concludes the selection purchase and planting of green plants the renewal activities brought clean and livable environment for the community the previous issues such as lack of parking space exterior walls damage and green area issues have all been resolved the external wall of the building and pavement before and after the community renewal are shown in fig 4 data for the benefit evaluation analysis of this case study are mainly from the contractors of xianghe community renewal project and the environment bulletin of nanjing 2018 additional data include open data from websites and literature a list of data sources used in this case study are presented in table 5 4 2 emergy based evaluation 4 2 1 input and benefits calculation the emergy analysis table of the xianghe community renewal is presented in table 6 the table was established on a one year period renewal activities including 8 months construction period and 4 month adaptation period external sources are classified as renewable sunlight and rainfall etc and non renewable such as materials energy electricity water labor services materials energy and labor services associated with the renewal activities are considered as inflows the raw data of all materials are collected from official tender documents the solar emergy of each flow was calculated by data in column 3 times transformity in column 4 the fraction of each flow to the total emergy inflows are represented in column 6 column 7 is the monetary value calculated as solar emergy in column 5 divided by the solar emergy per money ratio for jiangsu province china in 2007 considered as 6 2e 11 sej cny yu et al 2016 all references of transformities used in this evaluation are listed in the last column the calculation of renewable resources in table 6 is presented in appendix a values of transformities are relative to the 12 0e 24 sej yr baseline brown and ulgiati 2016 in renewable inflows precipitation brought the most emergy into the community amount renewable resources as 2 89e 15 sej yr according to odum 1996 the emergy flow of rainfall represent the renewable flow of the system due to the largest amount this could be a consequence of the location and the subtropical monsoon climate in nanjing china which caused the annual rainfall is 1 1424 m yr the bigger proportion in the renewable resource means more potential in sustainable development the sponge city is a supportive action on sustainable development in many chinese cities including nanjing the monetary value of renewable resource in xianghe community renewal equals to 5 16e 3 cny which implies that old community renewal activities are not a natural resource depended action and emergy inflows are mainly from nonrenewable resources non renewable inflows are classified into material energy and labor services as the solar emergy of each equal to 2 35e 19 sej 3 37e 16 sej and 1 11e 19 sej about 71 7 of total emergy inflow is from the material equivalent to 3 78e 7 cny the highest two emergy inputs are from concrete and painting as each equal to 1 37e 19 sej and 3 46e 18 sej it reflects that the main renewal activities are focused on the house reinforcement and painting when the high rise apartment buildings have larger area of external wall all raw data of materials in this research were from the purchasing list provided by the construction company labor services is also another high emergy inputs considering the consultation design site management etc are all need human resources and labor price keeps arising in china one different result is that energy inputs in old community renewal activities as 3 37e 16 sej in this case study is not as high as other building emergy analysis pulselli et al 2007 one reason can be that community renewal activities do not required many heavy machines to transport materials gay 2002 meillaud et al 2005 the total output of xianghe community renewal is 1 82e 19 sej as equals to 2 94e 07 cny which equals to 52 6 of the total emergy inflows in the annual renewal process the most beneficial resource is from the minimizing maintenance as 1 33e 19 sej or 2 14e 07 cny the second most beneficial resource is from the appreciation of fixed assets brought from the renewal as 3 35e 18 sej or 5 41e 06 cny there was a significant uprising of the rent as about 229 cny house in one year after the renewal activities the benefits from house agency property management and others are evaluated as the services or new business chances provided from the renewal activities social benefits from old community renewal is quite little comparing to other economic benefits however the emergy of science research 2 48e 16 sej has big potential in benefits creating more science researches on community development can be helpful for both school and community future development education and volunteer activity are also social benefit resources from renewal students can participate to different activities in better environment and notice the meaning of community renewal directly 4 2 2 emergy index analysis the result of selected emergy index is presented in table 7 three types of emergy indicators are evaluated for social benefits economic benefits and environmental benefits indicators are mainly selected from researches about system sustainability or emergy based evaluation brown and buranakarn 2003 brown and ulgiati 1997 pulselli et al 2007 this study only selects a few indicators which are widely used in emergy evaluation and significant reference value for community renewal the emergy per capita epp and emergy density epa are 1 15e 16 sej person and 3 39e 14 sej m2 which are two common indicators representing the rate of emergy use of community residents and reflecting the scale of the renewal activity comparing to other emergy research on building use and maintenance in 50 years lifetime as 7 65e 18 sej pulselli et al 2007 emergy inflows in one community renewal activity is much larger than the ordinary maintenance of the building in 50 year lifetime this is because that more material and services were introduced into the community which cost more emergy and finance inflow emergy investment ration eir and emergy yield ratio eyr are two interrelated indicators that give an evaluation if the process is a proper utilization of the invested emergy eyr in this community renewal is 0 526 when eir is 0 472 eir indicates that community renewal activities in xianghe community is mainly a local nonrenewable resources exploitation process when the investment of labor and services is not the point in the renewal activity eyr can be considered as the efficiency of the process which means the benefits from renewal is 52 6 of the purchased inflows in other words community renewal activities have an extremely large potential for regional economy promotion however a high emergy loading ratio elr equals to 1 20e 04 illustrates one problem could be caused that more stress will make influences on the local ecosystem elr at a high level indicates a possible meaning that the material and energy organization in old community renewal in this case study is not sustainable oriented 5 discussion and implication 1 discussion and implication on economic benefits this emergy based method quantified the economic benefits including many potential benefits sources the results indicate that there is much room for improvement in the investment and operation model of community renewal projects the capital investment for the renewal of old communities is not low if it is entirely funded by the government for regions with large numbers of old communities or an urgent need to improve the living environment the financial pressure and workload for the local government are very high it can be explained from the case study that the emergy and capital investment of the old community renewal are mainly used for the purchase of materials and human services including the publicity and coordination work of the renewal the monetary value 3 78e 07 cny of the material ininput is much higher than the labor services input 1 79e 07 cny but there is still room for improvement in the source of funding for the investment in renewal and the cooperation between stakeholders the orientation of government funding can be reflected through the scale of projects marked by renewal content he and zhang 2019 the main benefit of the renewal is the added value of the real estate but this part of the benefit is indirect benefit which the owners become the beneficiaries without any cash flow the government developers and other participants in the renewal activities are also difficult to obtain the added values in a social environment with stable tax policies it is possible to share financial pressure by attracting social capital to participate in the community renewal and management the cost recovery can also be in the form of rights allocating for example construction companies participating in house repair can have the priority to supply services such as building envelop maintenance and public building renovation operation methods as the ppp model in the construction work of sponge cities and smart cities in china are worthy of referring it is even possible to conduct residents fundraising to share the financial burden from government in future community renewal plans the high benefits of minimizing maintenance could be considered as a continuous effect over time assuming that the effects on minimizing maintenance from renewal can last 20 years srinivasan et al 2019 the average annual cost for maintenance will be reduced to 1 07e 06 cny yr or 6 65e 17 sej yr in this case study the saving cost means that the residential maintenance fund could have a longer service period to extend the lifetime of the building 1 discussion and implication on social benefits quantified method is helpful for social benefits evaluation since energy or monetary value containing in activities can be compared job creation science research and education activities are all necessary for future community development because some scholars have pointed out that the increase in living costs rents property costs etc brought about by the renewal of old communities may lead to the loss of community residents power 2008 the method used in this paper can clearly estimate the specific value of those social benefits higher social benefit value is more helpful for the propaganda of community renewal due to that the improvement of aesthetics and the understanding of living space renewal are important driving forces for many homeowners to support the renewal of old communities azizi et al 2020 this is in line with the large investment in painting and public space upgrades in the renewed communities in this case study 1 discussion and implication on environmental benefits the green space reconstruction in the community renewal needs to continue based on the results and previous interviews with government officials property staff and some house owners this study found that the lease of green space can be a new attempt the community could divide certain green areas and leased them to house owners of the community for management private planting space in urban residential communities is rare and the growing trend of micro scale planting make the demand for expanding individual planting space more apparent the limited indoor space can only provide limited planting choices the centralized leasing and management of community green space could ease the planting demands of some house owners however it should be noted that there should be certain restrictions on the breeds of plants in the green space for rent for example some large bushes may cause problems such as obstruction of roads and blocking of indoor lighting 6 conclusion this study provides a novel approach to evaluate the benefits of community renewal which allows for an objective and quantification of the inflows and outputs emergy as an assessment method can conduct a more comprehensive assessment of the behavior of integrated systems including environment economy and information flow according to the results of emergy analysis in xianghe community renewal it is found that the appreciation of housing prices in economic benefits is one main source of benefits for community renewal and the faction in case study accounts for 18 4 3 35e 18sej of the total benefits outputs however the added value benefit of housing prices is difficult to anticipate economic activities directly in other words the appreciation of the fixed asset in renewed community is a side benefit the main benefit of the renewal is still the improvement of the building and community environment the number of social and ecological benefits and output efficiency need to be improved with more practical actions relevant emergy analysis indicators demonstrate that community renewal is still a non renewable resource consumption process it depends heavily on external resources and causes impacts on the local ecological environment in this study the ema method was used to build a research framework for the benefit evaluation of old community renewal scientifically the application scenarios of the emergy analysis method have been expanded and some calculation method of the benefits of old communities has been proposed research on renewal of old communities based on the ema method also provides an objective design and decision making reference for community designers and decision makers to take energy saving actions for community update and development there are certain limitations in this study the specific benefits are uncertain for different regions or countries due to the differences in the content of the old community renewal it requires researchers to conduct in depth interviews with owners and developers in the renewal project to determine the benefits this research has shown that renewal activities are an important point in the life cycle of the community which will generate a large amount of energy flow and economic flow even if the research period is only 1 year the renewal activity could be helpful for life cycle assessment of one community and bring the renewal content of the community to the initial plan the short time period is also a limitation of this work due to the lack of empirical data in future researches the difference in emergy values between replaced renewable sources and traditional non renewable sources could be evaluated in detail to illustrate the life cycle benefits from the renewal activity how to expand the renewal benefits resource is another promising and meaningful topic for community development and even regional economy compared with the research scope of the existing research authors believe that the application of the emergy analysis method is wide ema can contribute to more researches on

24629,renewal of old communities is an inevitable process in urban development old community renewal brings multiple benefits to communities and their residents however existing studies on the benefits of old community renewal usually focuses on single aspects such as energy savings or property value increase an integrated framework that provides a holistic assessment of community renewal benefits is missing to address this limitation this paper proposed an emergy based method to quantitatively assess the benefits systematically from economic social and environmental perspectives based on the emergy theory the proposed method coverts various input and output during community renewal process into one standard unit the solar emjoule sej the method was tested in a case study of a community renewal project in nanjing china it was found that the emergy input in the case study was 3 46e 19 sej while the output from the renewal activity is 1 82e 19 sej the main benefit of old community renewal of the case study came from the maintenance minimizing and appreciation of fixed asset only 1 04 of total benefits of community renewal were social and environmental benefits this study provides an integrated quantitative approach for benefits evaluation in community renewal projects decision makers could use the emergy analysis to conduct holistic assessment of community renewal activities and make informed decisions regarding old community renewal keywords old community renewal emergy analysis benefits evaluation 1 introduction old community renewal refers to communities that have been built for a long time and have architectural environmental or management problems zhou and zhang 2015 qiu 2019 among global urban renewal cases china has great potential to exploit the diverse benefits in old community renewal due to its large amount of old community buildings and rapid urbanization trend güneralp et al 2017 old community renewal has become a long term and continuous plan in china it has been estimated by the chinese government that more than 160 000 old communities in different provinces of china need renewal mohurd 2019 by 2020 the total size of renewal projects would be about 4 billion square meters mohurd 2019 these projects will ultimately benefit more than 42 million households mohurd 2019 it has been estimated that the chinese government will invest about 4 trillion yuan in total for the nationwide old community renewal activities starting from 2019 qiu 2019 despite the significant financial investment requirement old community renewal could bring huge social ecologic and economic benefits existing studies have investigated the impacts and benefits of old community renewal at regional and city levels tanguay et al 2010 wang et al 2014 zheng et al 2017 some researchers have explored economic benefits of community renewal such as lower energy cost and new business opportunities ferreira and almeida 2015 zhao et al 2018 others have focused on social and environmental benefits such as employment creation increased comfort and annual carbon uptake azizi et al 2020 kim 2017 despite the efforts there are still many unsolved questions regarding old community renewal specifically there lacks an integrated approach to quantify the community level value of old community renewal considering the resource needs and various aspects of its benefits such comprehensive and quantifiable evaluation method is critical to assess the renewal plans and activities in a holistic way and make informed decisions accordingly for decision makers vega azamar et al 2015 giannetti et al 2017 to address this knowledge gap this study aims to develop an emergy based methodology for evaluating old community renewal considering its benefits from multiple perspectives by converting different inputs and benefits into emergy as a unified energy measurement the emergy analysis ema could assess different emergy flows involved in the renewal projects of old communities following an integrated framework eventually the objective of this study is to provide a quantitative evaluation method for both the public and private house owners to optimize their management and investment plans in order to increase the overall net benefits from community renewal projects the structure of this paper is arranged as follows in section 2 literature review on community renewal as well as emergy analysis and its applications are provided in section 3 the proposed emergy analysis methodology for old community renewal assessment is presented in section 4 the proposed method is demonstrated in a case study of an old community renewal project in nanjing china finally discussion and implication are presented in section 5 2 literature review 2 1 old community renewal community is traditionally defined as a physical space where people live the scale of community can range from 1 5 km2 to 5 5 km2 in china zhang 1997 based on other researchers communities can go beyond physical space as the locus of social service vigilante 1976 mcmillan and chavis 1986 identified four elements of sense of community as membership influence reinforcement and shared emotional connection due to the age of the buildings and facilities many communities have lost basic functions which have been required for modern living mohurd 2019 insufficient parking spaces around old community is a common problem in communities with poor living conditions moreover communities with absence of basic services or supporting facilities can also be regarded as old communities huang and sun 2016 wang et al 2013 yu et al 2014 the main purpose of the renewal of the old community is to improve the comfort of the original residential living environment and make up for the damage and deficiency caused by early design long time use inappropriate management etc li and meng 2013 all these problems have indicated that old community renewal needs large amount of external materials fuel electricity water and other resources to promote modern production and entertainment activities because building itself cannot promote as the environment lee and braham 2017 scholars defined the renewal program of these old communities as a collective effort between public private and non profit agencies to address developing problems in communities alonso et al 2019 old community renewal in china is mainly focused on the connection between the individual and the public including public space improvement green area reconstruction and property management improvement cai et al 2017 gu et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 the construction period of community renewal usually takes 6 15 months depending on the scale of the community qiu 2019 many researchers have evaluated the benefits of old community renewal from different aspects as economic benefits social benefits energy saving etc azizi et al 2020 pikas et al 2020 wang et al 2015 the benefit assessment process is also constantly updated by introducing new evaluation models ferreira and almeida 2015 martinaitis 2004 zhao et al 2018 2 2 emergy analysis emergy analysis is an energy centric system analysis method founded on the basis of thermodynamics general system theory and systems ecology odum 1996 emergy is defined as the amount of energy contained to produce a product or service and accounted by a unified energy standard odum 1996 since the energy on the earth comes directly or indirectly from the sun solar emergy is applied as a standard unit called solar emjoule sej in emergy analysis different forms of energy involved in one system including energy inherent to goods or services need to be converted to the solar emergy unit by different transformities brown and ulgiati 1997 odum 1996 the transformity is the solar energy contained in a certain type of energy or substance per unit amaral et al 2016 ema applied studies usually follow the procedure presented by odum 1996 which could be used to evaluate emergy performance of region level or bigger scale and been applied globally almeida et al 2010 brown and ulgiati 2016 vega azamar et al 2015 some innovative indicators are proposed for emergy analysis like net emergy surplus concept and an emergy based urban ecosystem health index lei et al 2008 liu et al 2009 emergy analysis has a wide range of application in studies for system assessment at different scales because of its unique capability in quantifying complex systems odum 1996 presented a procedure that evaluates emergy performance of nations and or regions with a case study in the united states of america at smaller scales emergy analysis were used in studies for urban metabolic patterns investigation and sustainability assessment fan and fang 2020 lei et al 2008 vega azamar et al 2015 zhang et al 2011 for example lee braham 2017 applied the ema to buildings on manhattan island and help to overcoming the scale and resolution mismatch between the macro level and micro level applying ema in building evaluation provides a holistic assessment of resources used in buildings and its energy flow meillau et al 2005 evaluated the emergy performance of a university building finding that about 95 of total emergy is from information pulselli et al 2007 assessed the housing sustainability by calculating the emergy of building manufacturing maintenance and usage these studies used ema as a useful tool to evaluate the performance of certain buildings or housing sustainability which proved the practicality of ema method in evaluations of buildings and in small scale regions however they neglect the benefits of these buildings brought to surrounding areas it is certain that the renewal activities can bring comprehensive benefits but many scholars have not made quantitative estimation for these benefits ferreira et al 2015 emergy analysis could be a promising tool in evaluating old community renewal activities community renewal activities involve many buildings which indicates that the application of ema on building performance could be expanded to renewal benefits evaluation study from lee braham 2017 has provide a good example to show the flexibility of ema in building evaluation the quantifiability and comparability of emergy analysis meet the need for quantified estimation for diverse benefits in old community renewal analysis emergy analysis of a community renewal activity accounts for all energy spent to produce its raw materials including wood concrete and many others as well as the energy taken in the labor equipment and service ema uses the transformity to covert different units into one standard the solar emjoule sej which allows direct comparison of different processes and products srinivasan and moe 2015 this inspired authors to propose an emergy based analysis method to quantify different benefits from old community renewal analysis 3 methodology an overall framework of the proposed emergy based old community renewal analysis is presented in fig 1 four modules are included in the proposed framework first it is required to draw an emergy diagram based on the flow of energy matter and money to form the inputs and outputs in the community renewal system second benefits from the renewal project need be recognized classified and elaborated third emergy calculation methods for benefits from different aspects need to be generated based on transformities finally the result of the study is presented as the quantified benefits in emergy analysis table and emergy indicators in the following sections each module is presented in detail 3 1 emergy based old community renewal model this paragraph proposes an emergy system diagram to show the paths of energy flow and material flow in the community renewal process the main components of the system include the community site community buildings community environment activities resources and residents external inputs of the system include sunlight wind rain materials equipment appliance labor services electricity gas water it is necessary to state that ema divides the input into renewable and non renewable resource the renewable resources conclude energy provided by sunlight rain and wind in local area the transformity for renewable resources required to take emergy baseline into consideration solar geothermal and gravitational potential provide a total emergy contribution to the geobiosphere of 12 0e 24 sej annually brown and ulgiati 2016 the non renewable emergy inputs of old community renewal are mainly based on the official project contracts from which the data of raw material equipment and energy is completely listed the calculations of renewable input are presented in appendix a which are based on the research from brown ulgiati 2016 all the transformity resources will be listed in final emergy analysis table and the conversion process listed in appendix b system boundaries and external resources are identified in a conceptual emergy diagram in fig 2 following the diagram rules proposed by odum 1996 the diagram describes resource inputs and flows in renewal activities in fig 2 community site presents as the basic frame to reflect the characteristics of location old communities are living spaces for residents where surrounding infrastructures such as supermarkets clinics schools etc have already developed to a certain degree renewal activities not only improve the community itself also drive the renewal of surrounding infrastructure or buildings making regional resources more concentrated and fixed improving the value of the location there are many other components in the community site and closely related to renewal activities this study would like to separate the community buildings as an independent component in community site due to that the renewal will be an investment mainly on the buildings in the site it is helpful to create a clear diagram to show the resources and work flowing into the renewed community other components are as follows 1 municipal lines road external envelop parking space are presented as one material tank in which energy and materials are stocked materials equipment labor services are external resources will flow into this tank through the public space renewal to renew the outdoor spaces and courts of the community 2 community green area provides places where carbon dioxide can be absorbed and oxygen be released during photosynthesis of plants green area can also collect rainfall and provide adsorption of dust most renewable resources flow into the community through the green area the area will be reconstructed to create a livable environment like roadside green area setting so the public space and community green area are interdependent parts in the renewal activity 3 security management services represents original functions of the community the old community faces many management problems because there are no extra money and labors for external services supply the renewal activity could be an opportunity for the community to improve the security and service level by introducing management company support and subsidies from local government can ensure the service quality more services will also affect the living cost of the original residents 4 public space renewal is one important process in the renewal activity it connects to all the outdoor space of the community roads in the community need to be repaved and repainted with the renewal of municipal lines some cables were hanging outside the external walls of the residential buildings which may cause safety incidents most cables will be set under the ground which also create a clear visual perception public space renewal could be the second biggest investment in the whole renewal activity 5 building maintenance is another important part in the renewal activity buildings in the renewal may stimulate the residents identification with the community and the willingness for long time residence some residents chose to renovate their own homes and purchased new furniture for further residence in the community there have been one research shown that aesthetics improvement adopting modern systems and extending living space can be the driving factors for house owners to conduct renovation projects for higher energy efficiency and living quality azizi et al 2020 6 the residents are represented as one hexagon tank it represents residents that live in the building and the number of residents in the community residents are core consumers and beneficiaries in the renewal activity the appreciation of fixed property and rent are two major economic benefits for residents from the renewal they also need to pay tax for the government and purchase services provided by the community 7 sunlight wind and rain are considered as renewable resources while electricity gas and water are nonrenewable resources in community renewal water use in renewal activities is different from regular house use a certain amount of water is used in material mix and site cleaning which does not enter to the civil water treatment system for recycling equipment and appliances conclude concrete mixer truck small generator water tank lighting devices etc labor and service concludes designing construction consulting audit etc equipment and appliances are estimated based on the money paid to purchase or rent them then labor and services are also estimated the same way constant energy inflows and materials are needed for maintenance equipment operation transport etc the main inputs are the materials equipment appliance labor services and consumption of electricity gas and water this component is the core of the old community renewal system which directly creates multi benefits for a community rain water sunlight can enter the process of photosynthesis and respiration in green area material equipment and applicant labor and service are needed to be combined and artificially processed for renewal activities the wastes from renewal also need to collect and transport which also be presented as a gray arrow 3 2 benefits recognition in old community renewal many scholars have investigated the benefits brought by community renewal table 1 summarizes the literature review results regarding the benefits of community renewal some of the literatures included in table 1 are not directly related to old community renewal however since old community can be considered as a part of the building environment system and ecosystem some of the benefits identified from industrial or ecosystem system improvement could also be applicable to old community renewal based on the literature review in table 1 the benefits of the old community renewal are identified and categorized into three categories economic benefits social benefits and environmental benefits table 2 provides a summary of all the benefits economic benefits are one vital benefit in renewal activities the appreciation of fixed asset can be considered as one significant benefit from renewal pikas et al 2020 since the appreciation of fixed assets only converts into currency when the transactions happened this study would like to refer the nominal rent to evaluation the benefit from the appreciation of fixed assets because for current residents the value of the house in the rental market is being used by themselves even after the renewal without any trade the renewal activity can attract more people to rent houses in the community due to the improvement of the environment and services housing agencies can take benefits from the increased rent with the renewal of the parking space the parking revenue can be a new benefit resource for the community although the parking benefits are mainly from the residents in the community but most of the parking revenue will be reused in the operation and management for the community itself the construct performance of the community buildings can be renewed and enhanced in other words residents can save more money on the annual maintenance due to the renewal activity the residential maintenance fund is set to prepare for the future maintenance of the buildings in the community the renewal has indirectly saved the money from the fund and could be considered as another economic benefit in the renewal activity social benefits from community renewal are difficult to evaluate since some benefits depending on user experience science research is an easily overlooked social benefit in community renewal it can bring realistic case for further research or regional plan which is important for future development of the community education and volunteer activity are great opportunities for residents to provide their contributions for the community environmental benefits are usually related to the green space and facilities in community green space is another inevitable part in most community renewal activities for example low impact development and sponge city project in china are expansions and enhancements for green space functions gu et al 2019 considering that the green area of urban communities is usually strictly limited some benefits appearing in large scale studies are not used in this study 3 3 quantification of old community renewal benefits this section will explain calculation method of the raw data that needs to be used in the benefit evaluation in this section all the benefits listed in table 2 will match a quantification method for the ema the main challenge of this method is to determine the transformity or unit energy value to obtain the transformity of resources all material and energy resources used to production must be considered and expressed in terms of emergy values therefore transformity is not fixed or unique for most resources in some cases it is difficult to directly calculate the unit emergy of a specific resource however unit emergy can be derived from other studies applying transformity needs to be valid under different conditions location or time this study applied this assumption to the emergy analysis of materials and energy in the community renewal to better understand the magnitude of possible errors literature references to select the currency emergy ratio of the province is adopted rather than national level value second this study artificially selects materials and energy from community renewal contracts with clear transformity reference for emergy analysis and the remaining materials are accumulated after economic cost then calculated by the conversion of the monetary emergy ratio referring to benefits listed in table 2 total emergy

of common residential parts and shared facilities and equipment after the expiration of the warranty period the renewal activity has provided an opportunity for the community to enhance the strength and functions of buildings this official renewal project needs to conduct comprehensive evaluation of the public space and building performance of the community in which the local government will participate in project supervision and inspection to ensure quality renewal activity can save the residential maintenance funds that were originally required to be paid by the owners of the old community in this study the calculation of the benefits of minimizing maintenance will refer to the official document published by the mohurd 1 1 http www mohurd gov cn fgjs jsbgz 200712 t20071228

emergy value of dust holding e m r c is the emergy value of rainwater conservation en1 carbon sequestration and oxygen release community renewal usually brings more green space and thus can increase carbon sequestration and oxygen release according to the photosynthesis and respiration equations the ecosystem needs 1 63 g co2 to produce 1 g dry matter and release 1 19 g o2 at the same time it means that for every 1 g of co2 fixed in the plant 0 73 g of o2 will be released ecosystem carbon sequestration e m c o 2 is mainly calculated by co2 emissions or removals which can be expressed as a calculation formula 11 e m c o 2 n p p c f s 44 12 t r c o 2 the emergy of released oxygen e m o 2 from renewed green space is calculated as 12 e m o 2 n p p c f s 44 12 0 73 t r o 2 where npp gc m 2

quantification of community renewal benefits from economic social and environmental aspects indicators can be generated to evaluate the performance of old community renewal table 3 provides a list of these indicators with brief descriptions and calculation methods for example brown and ulgiati 1997 proposed an index for evaluating the sustainable development of urban ecosystems environmental sustainability index esi which is widely used in the research of the sustainability evaluation these indicators will be used for evaluation of community renewal to measure the efficiency of emergy used in the renewal process all the economic benefits social benefits and environmental benefits will adopt some indicators from esi 4 case study in the following sections an old community renewal project will be studied the proposed benefits evaluation method was implemented in a case study of an old community renewal project in nanjing china benefits recognized above and emergy quantification method will be adopted in case study the result of emergy analysis and emergy indicators will presented in form of tables to show the energy use and benefits in renewal activities 4 1 basic information of xianghe community the community measured in this study is located at qixia district nanjing jiangsu province china there are two universities on the east and west sides and the surrounding communities are concentrated in the northwest and southeast the size of the community is 102 000 m2s with a total of fourteen 18 story high rise buildings there are about 3013 residents living in this 2010 established community more detailed information of xianghe community is shown in table 4 one important reason for the selection of xianghe community is that it is a typical high rise residential community in china in high rise residential buildings the service life of various equipment and facilities are mostly within 30 years which is more prone to problems such as aging and higher maintenance costs lin and hu 2003 compared with ordinary residential buildings the replacement and maintenance costs of these equipment are more expensive although this community is not very old in age due to the lack of good planning and design the community faced a lot of problems before renewal as shown in fig 3 asphalt roads in the community were damaged and dirty where motor vehicles parked in disorder painted parking space could not meet the increasing parking demand in the community residential buildings are generally old and cracked which affects the appearance and comfort of use to address these longstanding problems community renewal activities began in june 2018 and ends in january 2019 according to the renewal contractors the renewal content was divided into six categories architecture landscape electrical appliances intelligent community green space and water supply and drainage the renewal of the building also includes the demolition of the original illegal building the content of landscape and greening are different landscape includes the content of road works and structure expansion of green space in the community green space improvement concludes the selection purchase and planting of green plants the renewal activities brought clean and livable environment for the community the previous issues such as lack of parking space exterior walls damage and green area issues have all been resolved the external wall of the building and pavement before and after the community renewal are shown in fig 4 data for the benefit evaluation analysis of this case study are mainly from the contractors of xianghe community renewal project and the environment bulletin of nanjing 2018 additional data include open data from websites and literature a list of data sources used in this case study are presented in table 5 4 2 emergy based evaluation 4 2 1 input and benefits calculation the emergy analysis table of the xianghe community renewal is presented in table 6 the table was established on a one year period renewal activities including 8 months construction period and 4 month adaptation period external sources are classified as renewable sunlight and rainfall etc and non renewable such as materials energy electricity water labor services materials energy and labor services associated with the renewal activities are considered as inflows the raw data of all materials are collected from official tender documents the solar emergy of each flow was calculated by data in column 3 times transformity in column 4 the fraction of each flow to the total emergy inflows are represented in column 6 column 7 is the monetary value calculated as solar emergy in column 5 divided by the solar emergy per money ratio for jiangsu province china in 2007 considered as 6 2e 11 sej cny yu et al 2016 all references of transformities used in this evaluation are listed in the last column the calculation of renewable resources in table 6 is presented in appendix a values of transformities are relative to the 12 0e 24 sej yr baseline brown and ulgiati 2016 in renewable inflows precipitation brought the most emergy into the community amount renewable resources as 2 89e 15 sej yr according to odum 1996 the emergy flow of rainfall represent the renewable flow of the system due to the largest amount this could be a consequence of the location and the subtropical monsoon climate in nanjing china which caused the annual rainfall is 1 1424 m yr the bigger proportion in the renewable resource means more potential in sustainable development the sponge city is a supportive action on sustainable development in many chinese cities including nanjing the monetary value of renewable resource in xianghe community renewal equals to 5 16e 3 cny which implies that old community renewal activities are not a natural resource depended action and emergy inflows are mainly from nonrenewable resources non renewable inflows are classified into material energy and labor services as the solar emergy of each equal to 2 35e 19 sej 3 37e 16 sej and 1 11e 19 sej about 71 7 of total emergy inflow is from the material equivalent to 3 78e 7 cny the highest two emergy inputs are from concrete and painting as each equal to 1 37e 19 sej and 3 46e 18 sej it reflects that the main renewal activities are focused on the house reinforcement and painting when the high rise apartment buildings have larger area of external wall all raw data of materials in this research were from the purchasing list provided by the construction company labor services is also another high emergy inputs considering the consultation design site management etc are all need human resources and labor price keeps arising in china one different result is that energy inputs in old community renewal activities as 3 37e 16 sej in this case study is not as high as other building emergy analysis pulselli et al 2007 one reason can be that community renewal activities do not required many heavy machines to transport materials gay 2002 meillaud et al 2005 the total output of xianghe community renewal is 1 82e 19 sej as equals to 2 94e 07 cny which equals to 52 6 of the total emergy inflows in the annual renewal process the most beneficial resource is from the minimizing maintenance as 1 33e 19 sej or 2 14e 07 cny the second most beneficial resource is from the appreciation of fixed assets brought from the renewal as 3 35e 18 sej or 5 41e 06 cny there was a significant uprising of the rent as about 229 cny house in one year after the renewal activities the benefits from house agency property management and others are evaluated as the services or new business chances provided from the renewal activities social benefits from old community renewal is quite little comparing to other economic benefits however the emergy of science research 2 48e 16 sej has big potential in benefits creating more science researches on community development can be helpful for both school and community future development education and volunteer activity are also social benefit resources from renewal students can participate to different activities in better environment and notice the meaning of community renewal directly 4 2 2 emergy index analysis the result of selected emergy index is presented in table 7 three types of emergy indicators are evaluated for social benefits economic benefits and environmental benefits indicators are mainly selected from researches about system sustainability or emergy based evaluation brown and buranakarn 2003 brown and ulgiati 1997 pulselli et al 2007 this study only selects a few indicators which are widely used in emergy evaluation and significant reference value for community renewal the emergy per capita epp and emergy density epa are 1 15e 16 sej person and 3 39e 14 sej m2 which are two common indicators representing the rate of emergy use of community residents and reflecting the scale of the renewal activity comparing to other emergy research on building use and maintenance in 50 years lifetime as 7 65e 18 sej pulselli et al 2007 emergy inflows in one community renewal activity is much larger than the ordinary maintenance of the building in 50 year lifetime this is because that more material and services were introduced into the community which cost more emergy and finance inflow emergy investment ration eir and emergy yield ratio eyr are two interrelated indicators that give an evaluation if the process is a proper utilization of the invested emergy eyr in this community renewal is 0 526 when eir is 0 472 eir indicates that community renewal activities in xianghe community is mainly a local nonrenewable resources exploitation process when the investment of labor and services is not the point in the renewal activity eyr can be considered as the efficiency of the process which means the benefits from renewal is 52 6 of the purchased inflows in other words community renewal activities have an extremely large potential for regional economy promotion however a high emergy loading ratio elr equals to 1 20e 04 illustrates one problem could be caused that more stress will make influences on the local ecosystem elr at a high level indicates a possible meaning that the material and energy organization in old community renewal in this case study is not sustainable oriented 5 discussion and implication 1 discussion and implication on economic benefits this emergy based method quantified the economic benefits including many potential benefits sources the results indicate that there is much room for improvement in the investment and operation model of community renewal projects the capital investment for the renewal of old communities is not low if it is entirely funded by the government for regions with large numbers of old communities or an urgent need to improve the living environment the financial pressure and workload for the local government are very high it can be explained from the case study that the emergy and capital investment of the old community renewal are mainly used for the purchase of materials and human services including the publicity and coordination work of the renewal the monetary value 3 78e 07 cny of the material ininput is much higher than the labor services input 1 79e 07 cny but there is still room for improvement in the source of funding for the investment in renewal and the cooperation between stakeholders the orientation of government funding can be reflected through the scale of projects marked by renewal content he and zhang 2019 the main benefit of the renewal is the added value of the real estate but this part of the benefit is indirect benefit which the owners become the beneficiaries without any cash flow the government developers and other participants in the renewal activities are also difficult to obtain the added values in a social environment with stable tax policies it is possible to share financial pressure by attracting social capital to participate in the community renewal and management the cost recovery can also be in the form of rights allocating for example construction companies participating in house repair can have the priority to supply services such as building envelop maintenance and public building renovation operation methods as the ppp model in the construction work of sponge cities and smart cities in china are worthy of referring it is even possible to conduct residents fundraising to share the financial burden from government in future community renewal plans the high benefits of minimizing maintenance could be considered as a continuous effect over time assuming that the effects on minimizing maintenance from renewal can last 20 years srinivasan et al 2019 the average annual cost for maintenance will be reduced to 1 07e 06 cny yr or 6 65e 17 sej yr in this case study the saving cost means that the residential maintenance fund could have a longer service period to extend the lifetime of the building 1 discussion and implication on social benefits quantified method is helpful for social benefits evaluation since energy or monetary value containing in activities can be compared job creation science research and education activities are all necessary for future community development because some scholars have pointed out that the increase in living costs rents property costs etc brought about by the renewal of old communities may lead to the loss of community residents power 2008 the method used in this paper can clearly estimate the specific value of those social benefits higher social benefit value is more helpful for the propaganda of community renewal due to that the improvement of aesthetics and the understanding of living space renewal are important driving forces for many homeowners to support the renewal of old communities azizi et al 2020 this is in line with the large investment in painting and public space upgrades in the renewed communities in this case study 1 discussion and implication on environmental benefits the green space reconstruction in the community renewal needs to continue based on the results and previous interviews with government officials property staff and some house owners this study found that the lease of green space can be a new attempt the community could divide certain green areas and leased them to house owners of the community for management private planting space in urban residential communities is rare and the growing trend of micro scale planting make the demand for expanding individual planting space more apparent the limited indoor space can only provide limited planting choices the centralized leasing and management of community green space could ease the planting demands of some house owners however it should be noted that there should be certain restrictions on the breeds of plants in the green space for rent for example some large bushes may cause problems such as obstruction of roads and blocking of indoor lighting 6 conclusion this study provides a novel approach to evaluate the benefits of community renewal which allows for an objective and quantification of the inflows and outputs emergy as an assessment method can conduct a more comprehensive assessment of the behavior of integrated systems including environment economy and information flow according to the results of emergy analysis in xianghe community renewal it is found that the appreciation of housing prices in economic benefits is one main source of benefits for community renewal and the faction in case study accounts for 18 4 3 35e 18sej of the total benefits outputs however the added value benefit of housing prices is difficult to anticipate economic activities directly in other words the appreciation of the fixed asset in renewed community is a side benefit the main benefit of the renewal is still the improvement of the building and community environment the number of social and ecological benefits and output efficiency need to be improved with more practical actions relevant emergy analysis indicators demonstrate that community renewal is still a non renewable resource consumption process it depends heavily on external resources and causes impacts on the local ecological environment in this study the ema method was used to build a research framework for the benefit evaluation of old community renewal scientifically the application scenarios of the emergy analysis method have been expanded and some calculation method of the benefits of old communities has been proposed research on renewal of old communities based on the ema method also provides an objective design and decision making reference for community designers and decision makers to take energy saving actions for community update and development there are certain limitations in this study the specific benefits are uncertain for different regions or countries due to the differences in the content of the old community renewal it requires researchers to conduct in depth interviews with owners and developers in the renewal project to determine the benefits this research has shown that renewal activities are an important point in the life cycle of the community which will generate a large amount of energy flow and economic flow even if the research period is only 1 year the renewal activity could be helpful for life cycle assessment of one community and bring the renewal content of the community to the initial plan the short time period is also a limitation of this work due to the lack of empirical data in future researches the difference in emergy values between replaced renewable sources and traditional non renewable sources could be evaluated in detail to illustrate the life cycle benefits from the renewal activity how to expand the renewal benefits resource is another promising and meaningful topic for community development and even regional economy compared with the research scope of the existing research authors believe that the application of the emergy analysis method is wide ema can contribute to more researches on
