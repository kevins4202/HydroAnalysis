13490,the simulated constructed wetland with vallisneria natans was studied for the migration and transformation of dissolved oxygen nitrogen and sulfur pollutants and characterization of microbial community under different concentrations 7 5 15 22 5 30 mgn l of nh4 n results indicated that the recovery rate of do was 0 027 0 07 mg h and the removal rate of nh4 n was over 90 meanwhile s2 was generated into different forms when the do and the sulfate concentration were below 1 mg l and over 100 mg l respectively in addition 16s rrna sequencing analysis showed that after 30 days the microbial diversity in both sediments declined while that in the biofilms of leaves increased by 16 42 overall vallisneria natans can change microbial communities by releasing oxygen and provide attachment system to form biofilms when cinlet nh4 n 22 5 mgn l cinlet so4 2 135 mg l vallisneria natans can effectively prevent water quality deterioration and strengthen the in situ self purification ability of water graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords constructed wetland dissolved oxygen do functional microbes pollutant conversion vallisneria natans 1 introduction water sources such as lakes rivers and wetlands are important components of the urban ecosystem and they play important roles in flood control and drainage climate regulation and urban landscape beautification 1 2 due to the rapid development of the economy and accelerated urbanization water pollution and the ecological degradation of urban lakes have become more serious problems and seasonal and perennial water pollution are common 3 the traditional river regulation method requires complicated engineering consumes a large amount of energy and readily produces secondary pollution for example in guangzhou most of the river control has been completed the water quality has improved significantly and the treatment goal has gradually changed into how to maintain the treatment effect in order to deal with nitrogen and sulfur pollution such as rainwater runoff intermittent discharge of point source pollutions and nitrogen deposition activities to prevent water from blackening and stinking 4 in recent years it has been shown that submerged plants can effectively improve the water environment and increase the diversity of ecosystems thereby enhancing a system s tolerance of exogenous pollution and this has gradually developed into an efficient stable and energy saving treatment technique 5 6 submerged plant leaves are natural substrates for biofilm growth because they provide stable attachment sites for microorganisms 7 vallisneria natans is the preferred submerged plant used for cultivation in wetlands because of its characteristics such as well developed root tissues dwarfing pollution resistance and weak light tolerance 8 9 in addition the input of exogenous pollution leads to decreases in the concentration of the dissolved oxygen do the oxygen released by photosynthesis can provide electron acceptors for microbial aerobic metabolism and effectively improve do in water bodies 10 due to different characteristics of pollution the continuous or intermittent exogenous input of pollutants can have variable effects on the biofilms of leaves and sediments 11 12 in general nh4 n is transformed into no2 n by nitrification and then further transformed into no3 n then it is released into the atmosphere in the form of nitrogen and n2o through denitrification 13 n2o is an important factor that exacerbates the greenhouse effect previous studies have shown that denitrification can occur under aerobic conditions and less n2o is produced 13 15 under anaerobic conditions nitrate undergoes the process of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra 16 in addition stimulation due to nitrogen containing pollutants can alter the composition of the microbial community and the abundances of diverse genes 17 18 the relative abundances of denitrifying genes are positively correlated with the nitrate concentration and electrical conductivity but negatively correlated with the do concentration 19 high ammonia load causes oxidative damage to plant surfaces to greatly affect the stability of wetland ecosystems and thus pretreatment combined with aeration measures is required 7 the roots of submerged plants can increase the do concentration of sediment do concentration gradients with a reverse distribution form near the plant roots and the alternation of the do environment is beneficial for the simultaneous removal of organic matter and nitrogen 20 21 in addition to its important influence on nitrogen cycle metabolism do is also an essential factor in the sulfur cycle 22 23 in anaerobic conditions metabolism by sulfate reducing bacteria and iron reducing bacteria was active to generate reducing sulfides s2 and h2s and metal ions such as fe2 which combine to produce black precipitation black and malodorous water means the decrease of transparency and the damage to the cytoplasm of the microorganism 24 however assimilatory sulfate reduction can occur under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions therefore do can promote the oxidation of the h2s produced in the system or the assimilation of h2s by chemical or photoautotrophic microorganisms to reduce the release and deposition of reductive sulfides 25 previous studies have mainly investigated the migration and transformation of a class of pollutants on a macro scale in a single dimension the changes in the microbial community structure and functional distribution due to pollutant degradation also need to be studied to understand the in situ self purification function of water ecosystems and provide theoretical support for practical engineering application this study analyzed the variations in pollutants and the microbial community structure in the constructed wetlands with different concentrations of nh4 n 7 5 15 22 5 30 mgn l in particular this study aimed 1 to compare and analyze the variations in the do concentration and ph of the overlying water and interface with the sediments 2 to determine the variations in the pollutant levels chemical oxygen demand cod nh4 n no3 n no2 n so4 2 and s2 as well as analyzing the nitrogen sulfur cycle and related mechanism and 3 to assess the dominant community and distribution of the main functions in the biofilms on sediment and the leaves of vallisneria natans before and after treatment with influent in unplanted and planted groups and the mechanisms associated with the response of microorganisms to n and s pollutants 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental installations and programs in two groups of control experiments synthetic wastewater containing different concentrations of nh4 n cinlet 7 5 15 22 5 30 mgn l and so4 2 cinlet 45 90 135 180 mg l was prepared at an influent ratio of 1 2 5 the synthetic wastewater was divided into a planted group planted with vallisneria natans and unplanted group as shown in fig 1 the container used to prepare the simulated wetland comprised a plexiglass column volume 30 l diameter 250 mm height 600 mm distance between each outlet 100 mm containing 25 l of dechlorinated tap water and sediment with a depth of 7 cm the sediment was collected from yuexiu park guangzhou city guangdong province china center longitude 116 2600708 latitude 39 97185812 the sediment was returned to the laboratory on the same day and allowed to settle for 24 h before removing the overlying water and drying under sunlight the dried sediment was crushed and passed through a 20 mesh stainless steel screen to remove any impurities such as plant litter broken roots and branches 26 27 the same weight of sediment was placed in each of the two plexiglass containers vallisneria natans was collected from liwan lake guangzhou city guangdong province china center longitude 116 397428 latitude 39 90923 with the assistance of field staff on the same day well grown plants were selected in the laboratory and washed with pure sterile water the leaf surfaces were scraped with a soft brush 28 nine plants were placed in each experimental container at a planting density of about 200 g m2 the remaining plants were planted in plastic buckets for culture the experiment simulated natural conditions using artificial light philips full spectrum light emitting diode plant growth lamp 12 h light and 12 h darkness and the indoor temperature was kept at 25 2 c eggs snails and other small organisms in the water were removed on a regular basis the experiment was conducted during august and the sediment was divided into three replicates the culture period was 2 months and the experimental period was 1 month according to the nitrogen concentration gradient the sediment was divided into four intermittent influx stages where each cycle ended when the nh4 n level was stable after domestication of the simulated wetland system for 1 month artificial wastewater was added to the calibrated water storage tank using a precision peristaltic pump with a set parameter rate of 300 ml min the artificial wastewater was pumped into the lower inlet water samples were taken from sampling port outlet 1 and outlet 5 in the morning and evening to determine the ph and do nh4 n no3 n no2 n cod so4 2 and s2 contents ebo1 and ebo5 represented the overlying water and the water of sediment surface in the planted group respectively while uebo1 and uebo5 represent the corresponding water samples in the unplanted group fresh plant leaves and sediment samples were collected and 16s rrna analysis was conducted to explore the differences in the microbial community structure and specific functional microorganisms to assess the migration and transformation of pollutants and the related mechanisms 2 2 pretreatment of samples water samples were passed through an organic filter membrane with a pore diameter of 0 45 μm and diluted in an appropriate manner as required the sediment scraped from the surface layer was loaded into a sterile centrifuge tube and stored after rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen leaves were also collected for testing and packed in aseptic sealed pockets the leaves were pretreated as follows each leaf was placed in a sterile conical bottle before adding an appropriate amount of phosphate buffered saline kh2po4 0 27 g na2hpo4 1 42 g nacl 8 g kcl 0 2 g diluted with 800 ml distilled water ph adjusted to 7 4 constant volume of 1 l sterilization and shaking on an oscillator for 30 min to remove the surface microorganisms into the buffer 29 the buffer solution was then passed through a 0 45 μm filter membrane any large leaves or fragments were removed the filter membrane was then placed into an aseptic centrifuge tube frozen rapidly with liquid nitrogen and stored with dry ice 2 3 determination of environmental parameters and pollutant the do concentration of water samples was determined using a do meter ray magnetic jpsj 605f a portable ph meter rex shanghai equipped with e 201 c type electrode was used to determine the ph values for the water samples according to the requirements of the national surface water environmental quality standard gb3838 2002 no2 n nh4 n and no3 n were determined by a tu 1080 uv visible spectrophotometer persee china cod was determined using the potassium dichromate method and detected with an ultraviolet spectrophotometer after processing with a digester hach an ion chromatography ics 1000 dionex usa equipped with an ionpac as14 anion column was used to determine the so4 2 and the soluble s2 concentrations were determined with a portable multi function detector 321 s bante instrument limited china 2 4 bacterial community analysis the sediments of the planted and unplanted group as well as the leaves of vallisneria natans were labeled as pws uws and vn and were named as pws0 pws30 uws0 uws30 vn0 and vn30 according to running time of 0 and 30 days microbial dna was extracted using hipure soil dna kits magen guangzhou china according to the manufacturer protocols the integrity of the extracted dna was verified via agarose gel electrophoresis primer 341f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 and primer 806r 5 ggactachvgggtatctaat 3 encompassing the hypervariable v3 v4 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene were prepared and then amplified by pcr as described previously 30 high throughput gene sequencing was performed on the illumina hiseqtm 6000 by gene denovo biotechnology co ltd guangzhou china principal component analysis was performed in the r project vegan package version 2 5 3 and chao1 simpson and all other alpha diversity index were calculated in qiime version 1 9 1 the stacked bar plot of the community composition was visualized in the r project ggplot2 package version 2 2 1 which was also used to plot the otu rarefaction curve combined with faprotax database functional annotation of prokaryote flora the ecological functional characteristics of bacteria were generated 3 results and discussion 3 1 variations in the concentrations of dissolved oxygen and ph with different pollution levels do is an important index that affects the metabolic functions of microorganisms and it is usually a key parameter that controls nitrification and denitrification processes and the efficiency of organic matter degradation in the sewage treatment process 31 on the whole the reduction of do was positively correlated with the degree of pollution from stage 1 to stage 3 the concentration of do decreased by 1 99 mg l ebo1 stage 1 and 3 76 mg l ebo5 stage 3 during the initial 24 h and increased significantly in the planted group fig 2 a due to the influent at night the respiration and metabolism of plants and microorganisms consume a large amount of oxygen initially and the consumption of do enhances with the increase concentration of nh4 n during the day a large amount of oxygen was released on the leaf surface and near the root because of photosynthesis which provided oxygen to the system continuously in stage 4 the discrepancy of do decrement percentage between overlying water 58 88 and sediment surface 81 52 was the largest which possibly because the transfer of do was impeded during natural reoxygenation and the oxygen consumption metabolism tended to react on the sediment surface 32 as shown in fig 3 the reduction rate of do at stage 4 uebo5 0 211 mg h during the initial 24 h and the recovery rate of do in the next 48 h at stage 2 ebo1 0 0683 mg l were the largest the results showed that when the concentration of nh4 n was low 0 15 mgn l vallisneria natans could effectively supply oxygen as required by the system while when the concentration of nh4 n was high more than 15 mgn l this ability was weakened because of the damage to the surface of leaves and the reduction of total chlorophyll chlorophyll a and b thereby affecting the photosynthesis process 33 34 different levels of pollution also affected the ph of the system and submerged plants can regulate it in the wetland when the influent concentration was 7 5 mgn l the ph increased within 24 h in the planted from 7 2 to 7 6 to 7 3 and unplanted groups from 7 3 to 7 6 to 7 0 before then decreasing fig 2b at influent concentrations of 15 and 22 5 mgn l the ph gradually stabilized in the unplanted and planted groups after increasing for a period in stage 4 the ph increased gradually in the later stage in the planted group from 7 5 to 8 2 the ph was significantly higher in the planted group than the unplanted group and the difference was greater with higher pollutant levels it was possibly because the rate of alkali production such as denitrification and sulfate dissimilation reduction was higher than the rate of acid production due to microbial metabolism 35 36 in addition photosynthetic organisms such as plants and algae also increase water ph due to the absorption of dissolved co2 in the water 37 3 2 transfer and transformation of pollutants 3 2 1 changes in cod under different influent concentrations in constructed wetlands the main sources of organic pollution are plant root exudates litter and organic matter in sewage where the pollutants are generally found in volatile granular and dissolved forms 38 although cod is not the main index to evaluate the black and odorous water it affects the operation of the whole system as the important carbon source and electron donor 39 the cod of stage 1 ranged from 4 83 mg l final value of ebo5 to 34 58 mg l initial value of uebo1 in stage 2 the cod ranged from 8 65 mg l final value of ebo1 to 57 78 mg l initial value of uebo1 fig 4 a the influent water was kept in the first level effluent cod 60 mg l of pollutant discharge standard for urban wastewater treatment plant gb18918 2002 and the second class water cod 15 mg l of the environmental quality standard for surface water gb3838 2002 can be finally reached through the effect of submerged plant wetland ecosystem when the influent cod was further increased cod 60 mg l stage 3 and stage 4 the cod of planted group finally stabilized below 28 mg l remained in class iii to class iv surface water these results indicate that the wetland ecosystem can accommodate the standard sewage discharged from sewage treatment plants since the leaves provide a biofilm attachment site cod is used by microorganisms as carbon source and electron acceptor thus enhancing the removal efficiency it can be seen that the system can be used as an advanced wastewater treatment process in addition to maintaining its own water quality while in stage 4 the cod values differed significantly in the overlying water and at the sediment surface in the planted and unplanted groups this difference might have been due to mass transfer obstruction under a high pollutant concentration where the planted group increased the vertical differences in the cod to some extent due to the physical barrier between the leaves and roots of the submerged plants 32 3 2 2 changes in nitrogen containing pollutants under different influent concentrations in constructed wetlands subjected to primary and secondary sewage treatment the nitrogen in the influent mainly exists in the forms of organic nitrogen and ammonia nh4 n is an important index to evaluate black and odorous rivers which can be divided into mild the concentration of nh4 n 8 15 mg l and severe the concentration of nh4 n 15 mg l categories regardless of the nitrogen level the removal efficiency of nh4 n in planted group was always higher than that in unplanted group fig 4c in stage 1 cinlet nh4 n 7 5 mgn l the removal rate of nh4 n reached 89 7 within 24 h and the removal rate decreased in the same period in the other three stages the removal rate of nh4 n after 120 h was 75 3 stage 2 68 9 stage 3 and 85 7 stage 4 respectively yan et al showed that vallisneria natans removed nh4 n more effectively than other submerged plants and the removal efficiency reached 75 after 7 days at three concentrations 2 12 22 mg l tn of influent water which was similar to the removal effect of this experiment 32 the planted group mainly removed nh4 n through plant absorption ammonia volatilization and microbial metabolism the amount of nitrogen directly absorbed by plants in constructed wetland was only 10 however the effect of ammonia volatilization was more significant when the ph was higher which explained why the removal rate of nh4 n was higher in stage 4 ph 7 5 8 2 40 in general ammonia oxidation was the main method of ammonia removal in wetland systems with the increased abundance of nitrifying bacteria on the leaves the removal of nh4 n was enhanced at stage 1 and 2 the accumulation of no2 n in unplanted group was higher 0 085 0 125 mg l fig 4b and the level of no3 n in both groups was low fig 4a in previous studies the lack of carbon source might cause the accumulation of no2 n while the nitrification process in the unplanted group mainly occurred in the sediments with low dissolved oxygen leading to the dominance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria and the inhibition of nitrifying bacteria 41 significant accumulation of no2 n occurred in both groups during stage 3 and 4 however no2 n increased first and then decreased in planted group and the concentration of no3 n increased in the surface of sediment and remained high level in the overlying water the reason for the difference of no3 n concentration between the overlying water and the surface of sediment was that nitrate was not reduced in time thereby accumulating in the water however due to the relatively low do at the surface of sediment and the denitrification in the anaerobic environment part of nitrate accumulated at the mud water interface was consumed when the concentration of nh4 n is high the rate of nitrification will be faster than that of denitrification due to the restriction of do no2 n accumulates continuously but eventually oxidizes to no3 n with the recovery of do zhou et al studied the effects of different concentrations of ammonia on the nitrogen metabolism of myriophyllum aquaticum which indicated that m aquaticum could convert ammonia into nitrate thus mitigating the effects of ammonia toxicity on growth 42 3 2 3 changes in so4 2 and s2 contents at different influent concentrations the sulfur cycle plays an important role in wetlands where it mainly exists in the forms of so4 2 s2 hs h2s and metal sulfides in water 43 in the present study the concentration of sulfate increased and the dynamic changes in sulfur were investigated according to a fixed n s ratio fig 5 in stage 1 and 2 the sulfate reduction rate was slightly higher in the unplanted group 24 8 and 28 3 than the planted group 14 4 and 21 6 fig 5a and little s2 was produced fig 5b when the system is aerobic the dissimilation reduction process of sulfate is inhibited and the removal of sulfate is mainly through plant absorption substrate adsorption and microbial assimilation 25 in the unplanted group there were still a large number of anaerobic areas in the internal sediment which led to a higher sulfate removal rate as the pollution level further increased in stage 3 a small amount of s2 was formed at the sediment surface but s2 was not detected in the overlying water in the planted group this was consistent with previous studies showing the inhibition of the sulfate reduction process by aquatic plants 44 however it was found that when the concentration of sulfate in the influent reached 180 mg l the inhibition effect was weakened possibly for the following reasons a high ammonia nitrogen load caused damage to vallisneria natans b the decrease of do provided a suitable environment for sulfate reduction while the planted group and the unplanted group maintained low do for 48 h which was the main stage of sulfate reduction therefore compared with unplanted group planted group had no significant inhibitory effect on sulfate reduction under the high concentration of sulfate input moreover in the planted group the concentration of s2 increased rapidly at the sediment surface at 12 h after adding the influent and it remained high until 80 h whereas it remained low in the overlying water under the condition of low dissolved oxygen minimum do 1 mg l when the concentration of sulfate in the water accumulated to about 100 mg l the dissimilation reduction of sulfate was significant and the plants might affect the transfer process of so4 2 in the system and s2 accumulated massively when the ph was high 32 41 the water of the system was slightly turbid and the s2 concentration increased less in the planted group but the water body blackened rapidly and the transparency decreased sharply in the unplanted group possibly because the abundance of iron reducing bacteria fig 9c was low due to the presence of the plants and this inhibited the reduction of fe3 to hinder the combination of fe2 and s2 resulting in the accumulation of s2 however as the do concentration recovered some of the h2s flowed from the water and partly reoxidized with oxygen while so4 2 was reused by microorganisms or roots to maintain appropriate so4 2 levels in the water and sediment 3 3 community diversity and functional distribution the microbial diversity and community structure in the sediments and biofilms of leaves in the constructed wetlands were analyzed by 16s rrna sequencing and the abundances and changes in functional microorganisms were compared 3 3 1 richness and evenness of bacterial communities six samples of sediments and leaves pws0 pws30 uws0 uws30 vn0 and vn30 were collected at the beginning and the end of the experiment illumina high throughput sequencing of the v3 v4 region of 16s rrna was used to identify the changes of dominant strains and microbial community structure table 1 shows operational taxonomic units otu shannon index abundance based coverage estimator ace index simpson index chao1 good s coverage and pielou values of all samples the number of otus detected ranged from 1605 vn0 to 4046 uws0 with the lowest on the leaves of vallisneria natans after 30 days of operation vn30 and the highest in the initial sediment in the unplanted group uw30 the species richness was evaluated using the ace and chao1 indexes according to the calculated chao1 indexes the species richness in the bacterial communities varied from 2304 to 4347 the species richness in the sediment decreased in both the planted and unplanted groups but the species richness decreased only slightly on the plant leaves the results were the same according to the calculated ace indexes the simpson and shannon indexes comprehensively reflect the richness and evenness of species where the diversity is higher when the distribution of species is more uniform according to shannon indexes the microbial diversity of both sediments decreased pws 12 08 uws 12 13 while that in the biofilm of leaf increased by 16 42 similar results were obtained according to the calculated simpson indexes the pielou index only indicates the uniformity where a larger value denotes greater uniformity and the calculated values ranged from 0 539 to 0 827 in the present study the uniformity of the microbial distribution decreased in the sediment in the planted and unplanted groups whereas the uniformity of the microbial distribution increased significantly on the plant leaves previous studies showed that as the nitrogen deposition rate increased the loss of soil microbial diversity changed the ecosystem function which is consistent with the results obtained based on the analysis of microorganisms in the sediment in the present study 45 as for the variation of sediment diversity there was no significant difference in the diversity between the planted group and the unplanted group due to the relatively short experiment period which was not inadequate to reflect the change of microbial community in the sediment in the constructed wetland in order to compare the differences in the communities in the planted and unplanted groups and between the sediment and leaf samples non metric multi dimensional scale nmds analysis was conducted to calculate the distances between samples on a two dimensional plane and the grouping characteristics were visualized as a scatter plot the model obtained using this method is considered more reliable when the stress value is smaller where a better stress value is generally less than 0 1 fig 6 shows that the change in the community in the sediment was larger in the planted group than the unplanted group but there were also great differences in the sediment and leaf samples in the same system thereby indicating that the communities in the sediment and leaf samples differed in the planted group thus different functional communities and ecological functions may have been present in these parts of the system 3 3 2 bacterial community composition the relative abundances of phyla in the samples top 25 are shown in fig 7 a the main phyla in the sediment were similar during the early stage in the planted and unplanted groups where they comprised proteobacteria 39 00 47 01 nitrospirae 10 35 9 32 acidobacteria 8 28 8 68 and planctomycetes 7 27 4 58 after 30 days of operation the relative abundances of proteobacteria 40 53 50 87 in the sediment increased in the planted and unplanted groups whereas those of the other three bacterial phyla decreased the relative abundance of nitrospirae in the sediment decreased by 68 and 59 in the planted and unplanted group respectively thereby indicating that the abundance of nitrospirae in the sediment decreased with the addition of nitrogen which meant a reduction in the nitrification capacity of the system previous studies also showed that the abundance of nitrospirae in the soil was also reduced by nitrogen deposition 46 the abundance of bacteroidetes increased significantly in both groups but firmicutes from 0 79 to 13 33 became the dominant phylum in the planted group and members of firmicutes have roles in nitrogen metabolism such as bacilli as well as other specific functions 47 48 cyanobacteria from 0 27 to 11 7 were dominant in the unplanted group thereby indicating water eutrophication 49 the relative abundances of bacterial taxa on the plant leaves also differed where the abundance of proteobacteria decreased significantly whereas that of nitrospirae increased by 12 times from 0 26 to 3 43 and that of planctomycetes from 8 22 to 15 78 doubled compared with the original level in order to further determine the dominant genera of the particular function and the distinction between two phases of system operation otus classified to genus level were analyzed fig 7b after removing unclassified and other bacteria the initial dominant genera in planted and unplanted sediments were similar after 30 days of cultivation the relative abundance of azohydromonas 5 27 dubosiella 4 63 50 increased in planted groups significantly but the unplanted group was dominated by zoogloea 6 18 belonged to the proteobacteria the changes in the dominant bacteria in the sediments might not be entirely due to the input of pollution and the planting of vallisneria natans although we scraped the surface sediment as much as possible some of them might belong to indigenous communities in the sediments because of the relatively short experiment period the initial dominant genera in leaves were rhizobacter 6 09 and phaeodactylibacter 5 00 51 which belonged to proteobacteria and bacteroides respectively after 30 days of cultivation the azohydromonas 8 31 and tabrizicola 7 26 52 increased to the dominant genus which were pertained to proteobacteria the structures of the functional metabolic microbial communities also changed during the study in the nitrogen cycle the abundances of nitrifying fig 8 a and denitrifying bacteria fig 8b decreased in the sediment by contrast the abundances of nitrifying bacteria such as nitrospira from 0 17 to 3 36 which increased significantly in the biofilm on the leaves among the genera involved in denitrifying the abundance of hyphomicrobium 53 from 1 67 to 0 26 decreased greatly and the abundance of acidovorax 54 from 0 2 to 0 61 increased more and more studies have found that microbial denitrification can operate under aerobic conditions fig 8c 55 zoogloea peng et al 54 was the most significant and the abundance of aerobic denitrifying bacteria in the biofilm on the leaves generally increased such as pseudomonas a typical genus of nitrifying and aerobic denitrifying bacteria 56 57 in the planted group the abundance of the nitrogen fixing bacterial genus fig 8d azohydromonas 58 from 0 08 to 5 3 increased significantly after 30 days whereas those of other nitrogen fixing bacteria changed very little however sulfur cycle functional bacteria were mainly distributed in the sediment and the sulfur oxidizing bacteria fig 9 a and sulfate reducing bacteria fig 9b with major functions are generally strictly anaerobic the sulfur oxidizing bacteria were represented by sulfurifustis 59 after 30 days of operation the abundances of sulfate reducing bacteria decreased to various degrees in the planted and unplanted groups the main sulfate reducing bacteria comprising desulfatiglans 60 desulfobacca 61 desulfobulbus 62 and desulfococcus 63 were affected relatively more by the pollution load the relative abundances of iron redox bacteria and their associations with s2 utilization were also investigated the results show that the abundance of iron oxidizing bacteria in the planted group was similar to that in the unplanted group and the sediment was also their main habitat thiobacillus participates in both iron oxidation and sulfur oxidation and it was the main iron sulfur oxidizing bacterial genus in the system 64 however the abundance of the iron reducing bacterial genus geobacter increased greatly in the planted group whereas the unplanted group had a higher concentration of divalent iron and a black precipitated formed comprising fes which explained the blackening of the water body 65 3 3 3 distributions of specific functions based on previous studies of culturable bacteria the prokaryotic function database was integrated with functional annotation of prokaryotic taxa software and species annotation was conducted using silva to construct a species ecological function classification relationship network 66 the main metabolic functions in the planted group and unplanted group were visualized as an abundance heat map to assess the changes in specific functions during the operation of the simulated wetland ecosystem fig 10 the results showed that the abundance of the denitrification function increased and remained stable in the sediment in the planted group while the abundance of the nitrification function increased significantly whereas that of the denitrification function decreased in the biofilm on the leaves it is possible that the do produced by photosynthesis in the leaves changed the oxygen environment in the biofilm on the leaves thereby weakening the metabolic functions of some anaerobic denitrifying bacteria denitrification in the sediment and nitrification in the biofilm on the leaves were greatly enhanced to allow the regional differentiation of specific functions the leaves were suspended in full contact with the water so nh4 n was oxidized and it played the role of the fillers the nitrate produced by partial nitrification sank into the sediment to allow more efficient denitrification and absorption by the plant roots and thus the overall nitrogen cycle function was closed and efficient the denitrification function also had a high abundance in the unplanted group after operation for several days but the nitrogen cycle was not processed rapidly due to the lack of nitrification occurring in the water this explains the high ammonia tolerance and removal efficiency in the planted group after treatment with the influent in addition as the pollutant level increased the abundance of cyanobacteria increased in the sediment in the unplanted group but there was no obvious change in the sediment in the planted group whereas the abundance of cyanobacteria increased on the leaves at the same time thus the cultivated submerged plants effectively adsorbed the cyanobacteria associated with the eutrophication of water to avoid the formation of a barrier to the sediment the transport of do weakened and this promoted the formation of an anaerobic environment in the sediment and the exchange of material between microorganisms in the sediment and water reduced the functional metabolism in the sediment moreover the main sites for sulfate reduction were distributed in the sediment and the abundance of sulfate reduction was much lower on the leaves than in the sediment the do in the sediment was constantly consumed in the unplanted group and some anaerobic metabolic functions such as iron reduction were gradually enhanced so fe3 was reduced to fe2 and it combined with the s2 produced by sulfate reduction to produce the black precipitate comprising fes thereby resulting in the blackening of the water body and decreased transparency 4 conclusions submerged plants such as vallisneria natans could effectively regulate do improve the removal efficiency of nh4 n and imped the diffusion of s2 and the formation of fes thus inhibiting the black odor process nitrogen supplementation resulted in decreased microbial diversity in the sediments while increased the microbial diversity of biofilm and the abundance of functional microbes indicating an important and stable site for microbial functional metabolism in leaves good knowledge of the purification mechanism of

13490,the simulated constructed wetland with vallisneria natans was studied for the migration and transformation of dissolved oxygen nitrogen and sulfur pollutants and characterization of microbial community under different concentrations 7 5 15 22 5 30 mgn l of nh4 n results indicated that the recovery rate of do was 0 027 0 07 mg h and the removal rate of nh4 n was over 90 meanwhile s2 was generated into different forms when the do and the sulfate concentration were below 1 mg l and over 100 mg l respectively in addition 16s rrna sequencing analysis showed that after 30 days the

sources such as lakes rivers and wetlands are important components of the urban ecosystem and they play important roles in flood control and drainage climate regulation and urban landscape beautification 1 2 due to the rapid development of the economy and accelerated urbanization water pollution and the ecological degradation of urban lakes have become more serious problems and seasonal and perennial water pollution are common 3 the traditional river regulation method requires complicated engineering consumes a large amount of energy and readily produces secondary pollution for example in guangzhou most of the river control has been completed the water quality has improved significantly and the treatment goal has gradually changed into how to maintain the treatment effect in order to deal with nitrogen and sulfur pollution such as rainwater runoff intermittent discharge of point source pollutions and nitrogen deposition activities to prevent water from blackening and stinking 4 in recent years it has been shown that submerged plants can effectively improve the water environment and increase the diversity of ecosystems thereby enhancing a system s tolerance of exogenous pollution and this has gradually developed into an efficient stable and energy saving treatment technique 5 6 submerged plant leaves are natural substrates for biofilm growth because they provide stable attachment sites for microorganisms 7 vallisneria natans is the preferred submerged plant used for cultivation in wetlands because of its characteristics such as well developed root tissues dwarfing pollution resistance and weak light tolerance 8 9 in addition the input of exogenous pollution leads to decreases in the concentration of the dissolved oxygen do the oxygen released by photosynthesis can provide electron acceptors for microbial aerobic metabolism and effectively improve do in water bodies 10 due to different characteristics of pollution the continuous or intermittent exogenous input of pollutants can have variable effects on the biofilms of leaves and sediments 11 12 in general nh4 n is transformed into no2 n by nitrification and then further transformed into no3 n then it is released into the atmosphere in the form of nitrogen and n2o through denitrification 13 n2o is an important factor that exacerbates the greenhouse effect previous studies have shown that denitrification can occur under aerobic conditions and less n2o is produced 13 15 under anaerobic conditions nitrate undergoes the process of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra 16 in addition stimulation due to nitrogen containing pollutants can alter the composition of the microbial community and the abundances of diverse genes 17 18 the relative abundances of denitrifying genes are positively correlated with the nitrate concentration and electrical conductivity but negatively correlated with the do concentration 19 high ammonia load causes oxidative damage to plant surfaces to greatly affect the stability of wetland ecosystems and thus pretreatment combined with aeration measures is required 7 the roots of submerged plants can increase the do concentration of sediment do concentration gradients with a reverse distribution form near the plant roots and the alternation of the do environment is beneficial for the simultaneous removal of organic matter and nitrogen 20 21 in addition to its important influence on nitrogen cycle metabolism do is also an essential factor in the sulfur cycle 22 23 in anaerobic conditions metabolism by sulfate reducing bacteria and iron reducing bacteria was active to generate reducing sulfides s2 and h2s and metal ions such as fe2 which combine to produce black precipitation black and malodorous water means the decrease of transparency and the damage to the cytoplasm of the microorganism 24 however assimilatory sulfate reduction can occur under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions therefore do can promote the oxidation of the h2s produced in the system or the assimilation of h2s by chemical or photoautotrophic microorganisms to reduce the release and deposition of reductive sulfides 25 previous studies have mainly investigated the migration and transformation of a class of pollutants on a macro scale in a single dimension the changes in the microbial community structure and functional distribution due to pollutant degradation also need to be studied to understand the in situ self purification function of water ecosystems and provide theoretical support for practical engineering application this study analyzed the variations in pollutants and the microbial community structure in the constructed wetlands with different concentrations of nh4 n 7 5 15 22 5 30 mgn l in particular this study aimed 1 to compare and analyze the variations in the do concentration and ph of the overlying water and interface with the sediments 2 to determine the variations in the pollutant levels chemical oxygen demand cod nh4 n no3 n no2 n so4 2 and s2 as well as analyzing the nitrogen sulfur cycle and related mechanism and 3 to assess the dominant community and distribution of the main functions in the biofilms on sediment and the leaves of vallisneria natans before and after treatment with influent in unplanted and planted groups and the mechanisms associated with the response of microorganisms to n and s pollutants 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental installations and programs in two groups of control experiments synthetic wastewater containing different concentrations of nh4 n cinlet 7 5 15 22 5 30 mgn l and so4 2 cinlet 45 90 135 180 mg l was prepared at an influent ratio of 1 2 5 the synthetic wastewater was divided into a planted group planted with vallisneria natans and unplanted group as shown in fig 1 the container used to prepare the simulated wetland comprised a plexiglass column volume 30 l diameter 250 mm height 600 mm distance between each outlet 100 mm containing 25 l of dechlorinated tap water and sediment with a depth of 7 cm the sediment was collected from yuexiu park guangzhou city guangdong province china center longitude 116 2600708 latitude 39 97185812 the sediment was returned to the laboratory on the same day and allowed to settle for 24 h before removing the overlying water and drying under sunlight the dried sediment was crushed and passed through a 20 mesh stainless steel screen to remove any impurities such as plant litter broken roots and branches 26 27 the same weight of sediment was placed in each of the two plexiglass containers vallisneria natans was collected from liwan lake guangzhou city guangdong province china center longitude 116 397428 latitude 39 90923 with the assistance of field staff on the same day well grown plants were selected in the laboratory and washed with pure sterile water the leaf surfaces were scraped with a soft brush 28 nine plants were placed in each experimental container at a planting density of about 200 g m2 the remaining plants were planted in plastic buckets for culture the experiment simulated natural conditions using artificial light philips full spectrum light emitting diode plant growth lamp 12 h light and 12 h darkness and the indoor temperature was kept at 25 2 c eggs snails and other small organisms in the water were removed on a regular basis the experiment was conducted during august and the sediment was divided into three replicates the culture period was 2 months and the experimental period was 1 month according to the nitrogen concentration gradient the sediment was divided into four intermittent influx stages where each cycle ended when the nh4 n level was stable after domestication of the simulated wetland system for 1 month artificial wastewater was added to the calibrated water storage tank using a precision peristaltic pump with a set parameter rate of 300 ml min the artificial wastewater was pumped into the lower inlet water samples were taken from sampling port outlet 1 and outlet 5 in the morning and evening to determine the ph and do nh4 n no3 n no2 n cod so4 2 and s2 contents ebo1 and ebo5 represented the overlying water and the water of sediment surface in the planted group respectively while uebo1 and uebo5 represent the corresponding water samples in the unplanted group fresh plant leaves and sediment samples were collected and 16s rrna analysis was conducted to explore the differences in the microbial community structure and specific functional microorganisms to assess the migration and transformation of pollutants and the related mechanisms 2 2 pretreatment of samples water samples were passed through an organic filter membrane with a pore diameter of 0 45 μm and diluted in an appropriate manner as required the sediment scraped from the surface layer was loaded into a sterile centrifuge tube and stored after rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen leaves were also collected for testing and packed in aseptic sealed pockets the leaves were pretreated as follows each leaf was placed in a sterile conical bottle before adding an appropriate amount of phosphate buffered saline kh2po4 0 27 g na2hpo4 1 42 g nacl 8 g kcl 0 2 g diluted with 800 ml distilled water ph adjusted to 7 4 constant volume of 1 l sterilization and shaking on an oscillator for 30 min to remove the surface microorganisms into the buffer 29 the buffer solution was then passed through a 0 45 μm filter membrane any large leaves or fragments were removed the filter membrane was then placed into an aseptic centrifuge tube frozen rapidly with liquid nitrogen and stored with dry ice 2 3 determination of environmental parameters and pollutant the do concentration of water samples was determined using a do meter ray magnetic jpsj 605f a portable ph meter rex shanghai equipped with e 201 c type electrode was used to determine the ph values for the water samples according to the requirements of the national surface water environmental quality standard gb3838 2002 no2 n nh4 n and no3 n were determined by a tu 1080 uv visible spectrophotometer persee china cod was determined using the potassium dichromate method and detected with an ultraviolet spectrophotometer after processing with a digester hach an ion chromatography ics 1000 dionex usa equipped with an ionpac as14 anion column was used to determine the so4 2 and the soluble s2 concentrations were determined with a portable multi function detector 321 s bante instrument limited china 2 4 bacterial community analysis the sediments of the planted and unplanted group as well as the leaves of vallisneria natans were labeled as pws uws and vn and were named as pws0 pws30 uws0 uws30 vn0 and vn30 according to running time of 0 and 30 days microbial dna was extracted using hipure soil dna kits magen guangzhou china according to the manufacturer protocols the integrity of the extracted dna was verified via agarose gel electrophoresis primer 341f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 and primer 806r 5 ggactachvgggtatctaat 3 encompassing the hypervariable v3 v4 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene were prepared and then amplified by pcr as described previously 30 high throughput gene sequencing was performed on the illumina hiseqtm 6000 by gene denovo biotechnology co ltd guangzhou china principal component analysis was performed in the r project vegan package version 2 5 3 and chao1 simpson and all other alpha diversity index were calculated in qiime version 1 9 1 the stacked bar plot of the community composition was visualized in the r project ggplot2 package version 2 2 1 which was also used to plot the otu rarefaction curve combined with faprotax database functional annotation of prokaryote flora the ecological functional characteristics of bacteria were generated 3 results and discussion 3 1 variations in the concentrations of dissolved oxygen and ph with different pollution levels do is an important index that affects the metabolic functions of microorganisms and it is usually a key parameter that controls nitrification and denitrification processes and the efficiency of organic matter degradation in the sewage treatment process 31 on the whole the reduction of do was positively correlated with the degree of pollution from stage 1 to stage 3 the concentration of do decreased by 1 99 mg l ebo1 stage 1 and 3 76 mg l ebo5 stage 3 during the initial 24 h and increased significantly in the planted group fig 2 a due to the influent at night the respiration and metabolism of plants and microorganisms consume a large amount of oxygen initially and the consumption of do enhances with the increase concentration of nh4 n during the day a large amount of oxygen was released on the leaf surface and near the root because of photosynthesis which provided oxygen to the system continuously in stage 4 the discrepancy of do decrement percentage between overlying water 58 88 and sediment surface 81 52 was the largest which possibly because the transfer of do was impeded during natural reoxygenation and the oxygen consumption metabolism tended to react on the sediment surface 32 as shown in fig 3 the reduction rate of do at stage 4 uebo5 0 211 mg h during the initial 24 h and the recovery rate of do in the next 48 h at stage 2 ebo1 0 0683 mg l were the largest the results showed that when the concentration of nh4 n was low 0 15 mgn l vallisneria natans could effectively supply oxygen as required by the system while when the concentration of nh4 n was high more than 15 mgn l this ability was weakened because of the damage to the surface of leaves and the reduction of total chlorophyll chlorophyll a and b thereby affecting the photosynthesis process 33 34 different levels of pollution also affected the ph of the system and submerged plants can regulate it in the wetland when the influent concentration was 7 5 mgn l the ph increased within 24 h in the planted from 7 2 to 7 6 to 7 3 and unplanted groups from 7 3 to 7 6 to 7 0 before then decreasing fig 2b at influent concentrations of 15 and 22 5 mgn l the ph gradually stabilized in the unplanted and planted groups after increasing for a period in stage 4 the ph increased gradually in the later stage in the planted group from 7 5 to 8 2 the ph was significantly higher in the planted group than the unplanted group and the difference was greater with higher pollutant levels it was possibly because the rate of alkali production such as denitrification and sulfate dissimilation reduction was higher than the rate of acid production due to microbial metabolism 35 36 in addition photosynthetic organisms such as plants and algae also increase water ph due to the absorption of dissolved co2 in the water 37 3 2 transfer and transformation of pollutants 3 2 1 changes in cod under different influent concentrations in constructed wetlands the main sources of organic pollution are plant root exudates litter and organic matter in sewage where the pollutants are generally found in volatile granular and dissolved forms 38 although cod is not the main index to evaluate the black and odorous water it affects the operation of the whole system as the important carbon source and electron donor 39 the cod of stage 1 ranged from 4 83 mg l final value of ebo5 to 34 58 mg l initial value of uebo1 in stage 2 the cod ranged from 8 65 mg l final value of ebo1 to 57 78 mg l initial value of uebo1 fig 4 a the influent water was kept in the first level effluent cod 60 mg l of pollutant discharge standard for urban wastewater treatment plant gb18918 2002 and the second class water cod 15 mg l of the environmental quality standard for surface water gb3838 2002 can be finally reached through the effect of submerged plant wetland ecosystem when the influent cod was further increased cod 60 mg l stage 3 and stage 4 the cod of planted group finally stabilized below 28 mg l remained in class iii to class iv surface water these results indicate that the wetland ecosystem can accommodate the standard sewage discharged from sewage treatment plants since the leaves provide a biofilm attachment site cod is used by microorganisms as carbon source and electron acceptor thus enhancing the removal efficiency it can be seen that the system can be used as an advanced wastewater treatment process in addition to maintaining its own water quality while in stage 4 the cod values differed significantly in the overlying water and at the sediment surface in the planted and unplanted groups this difference might have been due to mass transfer obstruction under a high pollutant concentration where the planted group increased the vertical differences in the cod to some extent due to the physical barrier between the leaves and roots of the submerged plants 32 3 2 2 changes in nitrogen containing pollutants under different influent concentrations in constructed wetlands subjected to primary and secondary sewage treatment the nitrogen in the influent mainly exists in the forms of organic nitrogen and ammonia nh4 n is an important index to evaluate black and odorous rivers which can be divided into mild the concentration of nh4 n 8 15 mg l and severe the concentration of nh4 n 15 mg l categories regardless of the nitrogen level the removal efficiency of nh4 n in planted group was always higher than that in unplanted group fig 4c in stage 1 cinlet nh4 n 7 5 mgn l the removal rate of nh4 n reached 89 7 within 24 h and the removal rate decreased in the same period in the other three stages the removal rate of nh4 n after 120 h was 75 3 stage 2 68 9 stage 3 and 85 7 stage 4 respectively yan et al showed that vallisneria natans removed nh4 n more effectively than other submerged plants and the removal efficiency reached 75 after 7 days at three concentrations 2 12 22 mg l tn of influent water which was similar to the removal effect of this experiment 32 the planted group mainly removed nh4 n through plant absorption ammonia volatilization and microbial metabolism the amount of nitrogen directly absorbed by plants in constructed wetland was only 10 however the effect of ammonia volatilization was more significant when the ph was higher which explained why the removal rate of nh4 n was higher in stage 4 ph 7 5 8 2 40 in general ammonia oxidation was the main method of ammonia removal in wetland systems with the increased abundance of nitrifying bacteria on the leaves the removal of nh4 n was enhanced at stage 1 and 2 the accumulation of no2 n in unplanted group was higher 0 085 0 125 mg l fig 4b and the level of no3 n in both groups was low fig 4a in previous studies the lack of carbon source might cause the accumulation of no2 n while the nitrification process in the unplanted group mainly occurred in the sediments with low dissolved oxygen leading to the dominance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria and the inhibition of nitrifying bacteria 41 significant accumulation of no2 n occurred in both groups during stage 3 and 4 however no2 n increased first and then decreased in planted group and the concentration of no3 n increased in the surface of sediment and remained high level in the overlying water the reason for the difference of no3 n concentration between the overlying water and the surface of sediment was that nitrate was not reduced in time thereby accumulating in the water however due to the relatively low do at the surface of sediment and the denitrification in the anaerobic environment part of nitrate accumulated at the mud water interface was consumed when the concentration of nh4 n is high the rate of nitrification will be faster than that of denitrification due to the restriction of do no2 n accumulates continuously but eventually oxidizes to no3 n with the recovery of do zhou et al studied the effects of different concentrations of ammonia on the nitrogen metabolism of myriophyllum aquaticum which indicated that m aquaticum could convert ammonia into nitrate thus mitigating the effects of ammonia toxicity on growth 42 3 2 3 changes in so4 2 and s2 contents at different influent concentrations the sulfur cycle plays an important role in wetlands where it mainly exists in the forms of so4 2 s2 hs h2s and metal sulfides in water 43 in the present study the concentration of sulfate increased and the dynamic changes in sulfur were investigated according to a fixed n s ratio fig 5 in stage 1 and 2 the sulfate reduction rate was slightly higher in the unplanted group 24 8 and 28 3 than the planted group 14 4 and 21 6 fig 5a and little s2 was produced fig 5b when the system is aerobic the dissimilation reduction process of sulfate is inhibited and the removal of sulfate is mainly through plant absorption substrate adsorption and microbial assimilation 25 in the unplanted group there were still a large number of anaerobic areas in the internal sediment which led to a higher sulfate removal rate as the pollution level further increased in stage 3 a small amount of s2 was formed at the sediment surface but s2 was not detected in the overlying water in the planted group this was consistent with previous studies showing the inhibition of the sulfate reduction process by aquatic plants 44 however it was found that when the concentration of sulfate in the influent reached 180 mg l the inhibition effect was weakened possibly for the following reasons a high ammonia nitrogen load caused damage to vallisneria natans b the decrease of do provided a suitable environment for sulfate reduction while the planted group and the unplanted group maintained low do for 48 h which was the main stage of sulfate reduction therefore compared with unplanted group planted group had no significant inhibitory effect on sulfate reduction under the high concentration of sulfate input moreover in the planted group the concentration of s2 increased rapidly at the sediment surface at 12 h after adding the influent and it remained high until 80 h whereas it remained low in the overlying water under the condition of low dissolved oxygen minimum do 1 mg l when the concentration of sulfate in the water accumulated to about 100 mg l the dissimilation reduction of sulfate was significant and the plants might affect the transfer process of so4 2 in the system and s2 accumulated massively when the ph was high 32 41 the water of the system was slightly turbid and the s2 concentration increased less in the planted group but the water body blackened rapidly and the transparency decreased sharply in the unplanted group possibly because the abundance of iron reducing bacteria fig 9c was low due to the presence of the plants and this inhibited the reduction of fe3 to hinder the combination of fe2 and s2 resulting in the accumulation of s2 however as the do concentration recovered some of the h2s flowed from the water and partly reoxidized with oxygen while so4 2 was reused by microorganisms or roots to maintain appropriate so4 2 levels in the water and sediment 3 3 community diversity and functional distribution the microbial diversity and community structure in the sediments and biofilms of leaves in the constructed wetlands were analyzed by 16s rrna sequencing and the abundances and changes in functional microorganisms were compared 3 3 1 richness and evenness of bacterial communities six samples of sediments and leaves pws0 pws30 uws0 uws30 vn0 and vn30 were collected at the beginning and the end of the experiment illumina high throughput sequencing of the v3 v4 region of 16s rrna was used to identify the changes of dominant strains and microbial community structure table 1 shows operational taxonomic units otu shannon index abundance based coverage estimator ace index simpson index chao1 good s coverage and pielou values of all samples the number of otus detected ranged from 1605 vn0 to 4046 uws0 with the lowest on the leaves of vallisneria natans after 30 days of operation vn30 and the highest in the initial sediment in the unplanted group uw30 the species richness was evaluated using the ace and chao1 indexes according to the calculated chao1 indexes the species richness in the bacterial communities varied from 2304 to 4347 the species richness in the sediment decreased in both the planted and unplanted groups but the species richness decreased only slightly on the plant leaves the results were the same according to the calculated ace indexes the simpson and shannon indexes comprehensively reflect the richness and evenness of species where the diversity is higher when the distribution of species is more uniform according to shannon indexes the microbial diversity of both sediments decreased pws 12 08 uws 12 13 while that in the biofilm of leaf increased by 16 42 similar results were obtained according to the calculated simpson indexes the pielou index only indicates the uniformity where a larger value denotes greater uniformity and the calculated values ranged from 0 539 to 0 827 in the present study the uniformity of the microbial distribution decreased in the sediment in the planted and unplanted groups whereas the uniformity of the microbial distribution increased significantly on the plant leaves previous studies showed that as the nitrogen deposition rate increased the loss of soil microbial diversity changed the ecosystem function which is consistent with the results obtained based on the analysis of microorganisms in the sediment in the present study 45 as for the variation of sediment diversity there was no significant difference in the diversity between the planted group and the unplanted group due to the relatively short experiment period which was not inadequate to reflect the change of microbial community in the sediment in the constructed wetland in order to compare the differences in the communities in the planted and unplanted groups and between the sediment and leaf samples non metric multi dimensional scale nmds analysis was conducted to calculate the distances between samples on a two dimensional plane and the grouping characteristics were visualized as a scatter plot the model obtained using this method is considered more reliable when the stress value is smaller where a better stress value is generally less than 0 1 fig 6 shows that the change in the community in the sediment was larger in the planted group than the unplanted group but there were also great differences in the sediment and leaf samples in the same system thereby indicating that the communities in the sediment and leaf samples differed in the planted group thus different functional communities and ecological functions may have been present in these parts of the system 3 3 2 bacterial community composition the relative abundances of phyla in the samples top 25 are shown in fig 7 a the main phyla in the sediment were similar during the early stage in the planted and unplanted groups where they comprised proteobacteria 39 00 47 01 nitrospirae 10 35 9 32 acidobacteria 8 28 8 68 and planctomycetes 7 27 4 58 after 30 days of operation the relative abundances of proteobacteria 40 53 50 87 in the sediment increased in the planted and unplanted groups whereas those of the other three bacterial phyla decreased the relative abundance of nitrospirae in the sediment decreased by 68 and 59 in the planted and unplanted group respectively thereby indicating that the abundance of nitrospirae in the sediment decreased with the addition of nitrogen which meant a reduction in the nitrification capacity of the system previous studies also showed that the abundance of nitrospirae in the soil was also reduced by nitrogen deposition 46 the abundance of bacteroidetes increased significantly in both groups but firmicutes from 0 79 to 13 33 became the dominant phylum in the planted group and members of firmicutes have roles in nitrogen metabolism such as bacilli as well as other specific functions 47 48 cyanobacteria from 0 27 to 11 7 were dominant in the unplanted group thereby indicating water eutrophication 49 the relative abundances of bacterial taxa on the plant leaves also differed where the abundance of proteobacteria decreased significantly whereas that of nitrospirae increased by 12 times from 0 26 to 3 43 and that of planctomycetes from 8 22 to 15 78 doubled compared with the original level in order to further determine the dominant genera of the particular function and the distinction between two phases of system operation otus classified to genus level were analyzed fig 7b after removing unclassified and other bacteria the initial dominant genera in planted and unplanted sediments were similar after 30 days of cultivation the relative abundance of azohydromonas 5 27 dubosiella 4 63 50 increased in planted groups significantly but the unplanted group was dominated by zoogloea 6 18 belonged to the proteobacteria the changes in the dominant bacteria in the sediments might not be entirely due to the input of pollution and the planting of vallisneria natans although we scraped the surface sediment as much as possible some of them might belong to indigenous communities in the sediments because of the relatively short experiment period the initial dominant genera in leaves were rhizobacter 6 09 and phaeodactylibacter 5 00 51 which belonged to proteobacteria and bacteroides respectively after 30 days of cultivation the azohydromonas 8 31 and tabrizicola 7 26 52 increased to the dominant genus which were pertained to proteobacteria the structures of the functional metabolic microbial communities also changed during the study in the nitrogen cycle the abundances of nitrifying fig 8 a and denitrifying bacteria fig 8b decreased in the sediment by contrast the abundances of nitrifying bacteria such as nitrospira from 0 17 to 3 36 which increased significantly in the biofilm on the leaves among the genera involved in denitrifying the abundance of hyphomicrobium 53 from 1 67 to 0 26 decreased greatly and the abundance of acidovorax 54 from 0 2 to 0 61 increased more and more studies have found that microbial denitrification can operate under aerobic conditions fig 8c 55 zoogloea peng et al 54 was the most significant and the abundance of aerobic denitrifying bacteria in the biofilm on the leaves generally increased such as pseudomonas a typical genus of nitrifying and aerobic denitrifying bacteria 56 57 in the planted group the abundance of the nitrogen fixing bacterial genus fig 8d azohydromonas 58 from 0 08 to 5 3 increased significantly after 30 days whereas those of other nitrogen fixing bacteria changed very little however sulfur cycle functional bacteria were mainly distributed in the sediment and the sulfur oxidizing bacteria fig 9 a and sulfate reducing bacteria fig 9b with major functions are generally strictly anaerobic the sulfur oxidizing bacteria were represented by sulfurifustis 59 after 30 days of operation the abundances of sulfate reducing bacteria decreased to various degrees in the planted and unplanted groups the main sulfate reducing bacteria comprising desulfatiglans 60 desulfobacca 61 desulfobulbus 62 and desulfococcus 63 were affected relatively more by the pollution load the relative abundances of iron redox bacteria and their associations with s2 utilization were also investigated the results show that the abundance of iron oxidizing bacteria in the planted group was similar to that in the unplanted group and the sediment was also their main habitat thiobacillus participates in both iron oxidation and sulfur oxidation and it was the main iron sulfur oxidizing bacterial genus in the system 64 however the abundance of the iron reducing bacterial genus geobacter increased greatly in the planted group whereas the unplanted group had a higher concentration of divalent iron and a black precipitated formed comprising fes which explained the blackening of the water body 65 3 3 3 distributions of specific functions based on previous studies of culturable bacteria the prokaryotic function database was integrated with functional annotation of prokaryotic taxa software and species annotation was conducted using silva to construct a species ecological function classification relationship network 66 the main metabolic functions in the planted group and unplanted group were visualized as an abundance heat map to assess the changes in specific functions during the operation of the simulated wetland ecosystem fig 10 the results showed that the abundance of the denitrification function increased and remained stable in the sediment in the planted group while the abundance of the nitrification function increased significantly whereas that of the denitrification function decreased in the biofilm on the leaves it is possible that the do produced by photosynthesis in the leaves changed the oxygen environment in the biofilm on the leaves thereby weakening the metabolic functions of some anaerobic denitrifying bacteria denitrification in the sediment and nitrification in the biofilm on the leaves were greatly enhanced to allow the regional differentiation of specific functions the leaves were suspended in full contact with the water so nh4 n was oxidized and it played the role of the fillers the nitrate produced by partial nitrification sank into the sediment to allow more efficient denitrification and absorption by the plant roots and thus the overall nitrogen cycle function was closed and efficient the denitrification function also had a high abundance in the unplanted group after operation for several days but the nitrogen cycle was not processed rapidly due to the lack of nitrification occurring in the water this explains the high ammonia tolerance and removal efficiency in the planted group after treatment with the influent in addition as the pollutant level increased the abundance of cyanobacteria increased in the sediment in the unplanted group but there was no obvious change in the sediment in the planted group whereas the abundance of cyanobacteria increased on the leaves at the same time thus the cultivated submerged plants effectively adsorbed the cyanobacteria associated with the eutrophication of water to avoid the formation of a barrier to the sediment the transport of do weakened and this promoted the formation of an anaerobic environment in the sediment and the exchange of material between microorganisms in the sediment and water reduced the functional metabolism in the sediment moreover the main sites for sulfate reduction were distributed in the sediment and the abundance of sulfate reduction was much lower on the leaves than in the sediment the do in the sediment was constantly consumed in the unplanted group and some anaerobic metabolic functions such as iron reduction were gradually enhanced so fe3 was reduced to fe2 and it combined with the s2 produced by sulfate reduction to produce the black precipitate comprising fes thereby resulting in the blackening of the water body and decreased transparency 4 conclusions submerged plants such as vallisneria natans could effectively regulate do improve the removal efficiency of nh4 n and imped the diffusion of s2 and the formation of fes thus inhibiting the black odor process nitrogen supplementation resulted in decreased microbial diversity in the sediments while increased the microbial diversity of biofilm and the abundance of functional microbes indicating an important and stable site for microbial functional metabolism in leaves good knowledge of the purification mechanism of

13 reverse osmosis 14 oil water separation 15 and dye degradation adsorption 16 and the reported results have been very encouraging as far as 3dp technique is concerned for water treatment most of the studies are based on selective laser sintering sls fused deposition modelling fdm and digital light processing dlp which is primarily due to their high spatial resolution that is required for most water separation and purification devices 17 however these accurate and precise 3dp techniques offer limited materials variety and require significantly expensive hardware that limits their use at the commercial scale on the contrary direct ink writing diw is a much more economical 3dp technique that offers unlimited materials variety design flexibility and demands limited operator skills however at the cost of reduced spatial resolution 18 the potential of diw based 3dp has been explored in several water treatment applications where the spatial resolution is of a lesser concern and a reasonably stable structure with a well defined morphology and sub millimeter resolution is able to adsorb repel the target pollutant from wastewater for instance clay structures fabricated via diw exhibited excellent reduction in turbidity and bacterial concentration when used as filters in a lab scale column type setup for wastewater treatment 19 similarly porous polymeric meshes with well defined geometries printed via diw provided excellent oil water separation efficiency with a high flux throughput 20 these studies provide strong motivation to develop further structural components and devices using diw by employing new and un conventional materials that are effective in different water treatment applications moreover investigations on different fillers and additives that can impart suitable rheological properties for improved diw extrudability flowability and buildability are crucial for upscaling the use of 3dp in water industry among the range of materials used for water treatment and purification zeolites have been widely employed due to their excellent ion exchange and adsorption properties which are attributed to their mesoporosity and three dimensional porous nature at the molecular scale 21 due to their net negative surface charge zeolites have been particularly effective in adsorbing cationic pollutants from wastewater these include nh4 ions that are abundant in the municipal wastewater and heavy metal ions such as zn2 cr2 pb2 cd2 cu2 and as3 that are among the toxic pollutants present in the groundwater and variety of industrial wastewaters in particular zeolites have been extensively studied and applied for removing heavy metals due to their excellent selectivity and adsorbing efficiency that can be further tuned via different modifying agents such as acids or bases inorganic salts and cationic surfactants 22 to date large number of studies has been published reporting high efficiency of both natural and synthetic zeolites as heavy metal adsorbents a comprehensive review by yuan 23 summarizes variety of zeolites and their metal removal efficiency from wastewater as reported by various researchers over the past few decades global increase in carcinogenesis and neurological diseases among humans and their direct link to excessive heavy metals intake 24 has led to the development of strict protocols for maximum allowable concentration of heavy metals in drinking water as well as the water that is directly used by the food industries 25 this ultimately triggered and accelerated a widespread research for developing efficient materials and technologies to remediate different heavy metals in natural and industrial wastewaters zeolites being the efficient and well known materials for capturing heavy metals consequently require greater attention so that they can be applied at the industrial scale for continuous and efficient removal of heavy metals from wastewater in general there are two ways in which the zeolites can be employed for capturing heavy metals from aqueous media batch and column process 26 in the batch process a certain quantity of zeolite powder is brought in contact with the contaminated water via rigorous mixing followed by the separation of zeolite via filtration the removal efficiency of the target heavy metal is governed by the contact time mixing speed and the solution temperature and ph on the contrary the column process involves a continuous flow of wastewater streams over the zeolite packed beds and the removal efficiency of the heavy metals is again mainly dependent upon several factors such as the solution temperature ph and flow rate as evident due to the massive volumes of wastewater and high throughput requirement the column type configuration is more applicable at the industrial scale and therefore it is important to find suitable methods by which the zeolites can be integrated in columns and other continuous flow systems for fast and efficient removal of heavy metals from waste water driven by this motivation and utilizing the potential of 3dp zeolite y structures were fabricated via diw of zeolite y paste containing nanoclay and other additives to achieve appropriate rheology for consistent 3d printability to the best of our knowledge 3d printed zeolites with good structural integrity that are capable of removing heavy metals from water in a continuous flow process have not been reported so far the 3d printed zeolite y structures were tested in a lab scale column type configuration for their metal capturing efficiency from the contaminated water as an example we selected lead pb and copper cu as our target heavy metal pollutants pb is among the highly toxic metals which are well known for causing serious damage to kidneys and liver and inducing various forms of cancers in humans 27 excess levels of cu are also responsible for causing damage to organs as well as the digestive and nervous system in humans 28 the regulatory limits of pb and cu in the drinking water according to the us environmental protection agency epa are 0 015 ppm and 1 3 ppm respectively 29 the 3d printed zeolite y structures investigated in this study were capable of reducing pb and cu concentrations in the aqueous media to a level close to these regulatory limits 2 experimental methods 2 1 materials and mixing the zeolite y used in this study was cbv100 zeolite international usa for which the specific surface area ssa was found to be 820 m2 g this type of synthetic zeolite in which na acts as an exchange ion has been found to be effective in capturing heavy metals from aqueous media 30 31 bentonite nanoclay sigma aldrich usa was used as a compatible binder for zeolite which also helped in improving the 3d printability this particular type of clay has been found to be effective for binding and mechanical integrity of different 3d printed zeolites 32 33 polyvinyl alcohol pva mw 195 000 sigma aldrich usa was added to impart some viscoelasticity to the zeolite paste while hydroxyethyl cellulose sigma aldrich usa was added as a suspension aid additive saa to maintain the paste homogeneity during 3dp small amount of non ionic surfactant also termed as defoamer coatex usa was added to avoid air entrapment in the paste deionized water milliq was used as a liquid for paste formation to produce a homogenous 3d printable mix the solid components cbv100 nanoclay and saa were first dry mixed in a planetary ball mill xqm 2a tencan china for 30 min to obtain a homogenous powder mix while the liquid components 10 wt pva solution in water and the defoamer were separately mixed using a magnetic stirrer to obtain a homogenous liquid solution this solution was then added to the jars containing the mixed powders followed by 30 min of mixing zirconia jars and balls were used for ball mixing maintaining the speed of 300 rpm and balls to paste weight ratio of nearly 4 1 this procedure resulted in a homogenous paste that provided consistent and repeatable 3d printing table 1 summarizes the paste composition that was subsequently 3d printed 2 2 rheology rheological properties of the freshly prepared 3d printable zeolite paste were determined using a rotational rheometer mcr72 anton paar gmbh austria equipped with a 25 mm diameter parallel plate measuring system before starting the experiment the paste was placed on the static plate while the rotating plate was brought in contact with the paste maintaining the distance of 1 mm between the two plates the shear stress and viscosity of the freshly prepared paste were determined under the shear rates of 1 10 s 1 while the time dependent shear stress and viscosity were determined via linear fitting of the shear stress vs shear rate curves that were obtained after varying time intervals 2 3 3d printing zeolite y paste was 3d printed using a high resolution 3d printer engine hr hyrel3d usa equipped with a 5 ml syringe dispensing head sds 5 structures were designed in a hyperboloid like shape which allowed facile integration and removal of the structures during the column based water treatment experiments the 3d printable zeolite paste was transferred to a 5 ml syringe and mounted on the 3d printer head for subsequent printing the g code understandable by the printer interface was generated through slic3r software while using the nozzle diameter layer height and printing speed of 0 4 mm 0 3 mm and 2 mm s respectively aligned rectilinear infill pattern was selected with 15 infill with only 1 perimeter which served as an outer boundary of the object this resulted in the material extrusion rate that corresponds to the shear rate of nearly 1 5 s 1 during the printing process the resulting printing duration was about 90 min during which the paste maintained its flow consistency once 3dp was complete the structures were left undisturbed overnight on the 3d printer stage for drying leading to enough solidification of zeolite y for manual handling the 3d printed zeolite samples obtained at this stage were named as 3dz 2 4 heat treatment after overnight drying the printed structure was calcined to remove pva and other additives to determine an optimal calcination temperature thermogravimetric analysis tga of the starting powders and 3dz was conducted using simultaneous thermal analyzer sdt q600 ta instruments usa in the temperature range of 25 1000 c maintaining the heating rate of 10 c min the calcination was performed in a box furnace at 600 c for 2 h using the temperature ramp rate of 5 c min after the calcination cycle the furnace was allowed to reach the room temperature naturally the 3d printed calcined zeolite obtained at this stage was named as 3dzc since 3dzc underwent calcination at 600 c four out of six components used for paste preparation i e pva saa defoamer and water were completely removed as the decomposition evaporation temperature of these four components lies well below 600 c the final 3dzc structure comprises of only zeolite y cbv100 and the nanoclay with a relative weight percentage of 78 5 and 21 5 respectively 2 5 morphology and microstructure the ssa and porosity of the samples were measured using a helium sorption system nova 4200e quantachrome instruments austria the ssa was calculated using the well known brunauer emmett teller bet method while the pore size distribution was determined using the density functional theory dft which is generally more accurate for the mesoporous materials 34 the inner and the outer morphology of the samples was examined using a scanning electron microscope sem quanta 450 fei netherlands operating at an accelerating voltage of 10 kv prior to sem imaging the samples were coated with a 50 nm layer of gold to avoid any charging issues powder x ray diffraction pxrd analysis empyrean panalytical uk was used for determining the crystalline structure of the raw powders 3dz and 3dzc fine ground to powder state the spectra were collected using cu kα radiation λ 1 54 å in the 2θ range of 5 60 with a step size of 0 05 and the data collection time of 200 s per step 2 6 column experiments 3dzc were tested for their metal removal efficiency from aqueous media in a simple lab scale column type setup a 100 ml burette with a valve and a stop cork was cut close to the valve side where 3dzc was mounted to act as an adsorbing agent the hyperboloid shape of 3dzc allowed easy placement and removal during each experiment as well as a self sealing effect ensuring that all the contaminated water passes through its channels after maximum contact the other half of the burette was then attached to the assembly and the junction was sealed with a clear silicon that ensured a leak free column setup stock solutions of pb and cu with a concentration of 25 ppm were prepared in the di water by diluting 1000 ppm standard pb and cu solutions provided by sigma aldrich these stock solutions acted as contaminated water samples that were passed through 3dzc using the column setup described above the experiments were conducted under varying flow rates and ph using 50 ml of contaminated water in each experiment the flow rate ultimately controlled the contact time of water with 3dzc while the effect of ph was important as it strongly influences the metal adsorbing efficiency of zeolites the flow rate of the contaminated water was controlled through the valve while the ph was controlled by adding an appropriate amount of 1 m hno3 solution depending upon the flow rate used the duration of the adsorption study varied from 15 to 100 min the treated water samples were collected in a graduated cylinder and then subsequently analyzed for their heavy metal concentration after each experiment the column was disassembled by peeling of the clear silicon and easy removal of 3dzc before the next experiment 3dzc was regenerated by immersing in 0 5 m nacl solution for 5 h with frequent stirring followed by washing with di water this simple protocol has been successfully employed by several researchers for regenerating zeolite y 35 36 finally 3dzc was dried in an oven at 80 c in an oven for 2 3 h and then used for next water treatment experiments 2 7 heavy metals concentration the concentration of pb and cu in the treated water samples was analyzed using the graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy aas system ice3000 thermo fisher scientific usa equipped with an automated sample handling and loading facility metal specific hollow cathode lamps served as a radiation source while the background correction was achieved via deuterium lamp radiation as recommended by the equipment manufacturer appropriate amount of ammonium nitrate solution was used as a modifier to achieve better accuracy in the concentration values 37 three measurements were done for each sample and the concentration results were reported with standard deviation the metal concentration of the treated water and the starting stock solution also allowed for the calculation of 3dzc absorption capacity ac through the following commonly used relation ac c i c f v m where ci and cf are the initial and final solution concentrations respectively v is the volume of the treated solution and m is the mass of zeolite present in 3dzc it is important to realize the role of nanoclay which is present in 3dzc in adsorbing pb and cu because some clays have been reported as effective metal sorbents due to their porous and 3d molecular structure 38 however clays are effective only after certain modifications as their natural state exhibits limited ion exchange capability 39 to clarify this aspect we conducted an initial experiment by stirring equal amount of nanoclay and zeolite y in pb and cu containing water and observed negligible adsorbing efficiency of nanoclay as compared to zeolite y therefore the nanoclay present in 3dzc structure solely acts as a binder while the zeolite y plays the main role as metal sorbent 3 results and discussion 3 1 rheology and 3d printing for the materials in a paste like form and that are relatively new for 3dp it is vital to examine and quantify their rheological properties to pave the way towards their improved and repeatable 3dp zeolites are relatively new in this domain and only few publications have reported 3d printed zeolite structures as adsorbents for different gases and organic species 32 33 however the rheological behavior of these zeolite pastes was not reported fig 1a shows the dynamic viscosity and shear stress of the freshly prepared 3d printable zeolite y paste used in this study under low shear rates the exponential decay of viscosity with an increasing shear rate shows the shear thinning behavior which is further supported by the shear stress trend where the critical shear stress of about 76 pa was observed at the shear rate of approximately 0 8 s 1 upon further increase in the shear rate the shear stress increases almost linearly while the dynamic viscosity stabilizes at nearly 15 pa s linear fitting of the shear stress data in the shear rate range of 1 10 s 1 provided the shear yield stress and plastic viscosity of 87 1 pa and 6 8 pa s respectively as shown through the first data points at time 0 min in fig 1b similar shear stress vs shear rate curves were obtained after increasing time intervals and the calculated values of shear yield stress and plastic viscosity are shown via remaining data points in fig 1b the shear stress increases almost linearly with time due to the gradual drying and hardening of zeolite paste accordingly the plastic viscosity also increases however at a much faster pace during the first hour as compared to the later period the parameters selected for 3d printing correspond to the shear rate of nearly 1 5 s 1 and the printing duration of about 90 min during this period 3dp remained consistent and the 3d printer head was able to provide smooth and continuous extrusion for the plastic viscosity values that prevailed for the paste in addition the shear strength that developed over time as the paste dried out was high enough to ensure the structural integrity of 3d printed zeolite y the computer aided design cad model of the hyperboloid like object that was 3d printed is shown in fig 2a while the corresponding sliced model that was subsequently converted to the g code for 3dp is shown in fig 2b the 3d printed and dried zeolite y structure 3dz shown in fig 2c reflects good shape conformance with respect to the actual cad model slight increase in the diameter and decrease in the length can be attributed to the combined compression effect caused by the weight of each subsequently printed layer after calcination at 600 c the zeolite y structure 3dzc retained its shape and integrity with a slight shrinkage as shown in fig 2d which can be attributed to the loss of pva and the adsorbed water also the texture changed from whitish to brownish after calcination due to the removal of pva and hence a greater contribution of brownish clay to the overall texture as compared to 3dz 3dzc was slightly more brittle which is expected due to the loss of polymer however despite this brittleness 3dzc maintained its integrity and uniformity even after several handling and testing cycles the calcination step was necessary to remove the pva and impart greater porosity to the structure the trial experiments in this work showed that despite some porosity the 3dz structure exhibit poor metal adsorption concentration of 25 ppm pb stock solution reduced to only 19 3 ppm at flow rate 0 5 ml min and ph 5 which can be attributed to the blockage of active sites caused by the pva molecules moreover physical destabilization was observed during the adsorption experiments due to the solubility of pva in water only after the calcination step the structure exhibited physical stability along with higher porosity and surface area and hence an appreciable metal absorption capacity thus for the materials like zeolite whose performance is primarily governed by their porosity and sorption properties the addition of polymer is required solely for viscoelasticity to facilitate their 3dp after consolidation the polymer must be removed to restore the microstructure and hence the desired properties 32 also heat treatment below the recrystallization temperature is recommended for zeolites prior to their use as it improves their crystallinity and mesoporosity by removing the adsorbed water and other impurities 40 3 2 morphology and microstructure the tga analysis of the starting materials and 3dz which allowed the selection of optimal calcination temperature is shown in fig 3a the cbv100 underwent nearly 16 weight loss up till 300 c which corresponds to the loss of physically and chemically adsorbed water in the case of nanoclay the weight loss due to dehydration is about 8 which continues up till 700 c due to the strongly bonded water in the molecular interstices which is in agreement with the tga studies conducted for similar types of clays 41 however zeolite y undergoes significant loss in crystallinity at temperatures above 700 c 42 and therefore the calcination temperature must be limited to preserve its microstructure 3dz underwent a weight loss of about 25 representing a combined dehydration of zeolite y and nanoclay along with the decomposition of pva which is evident in the form of a sharp weight loss in the temperature range of 300 400 c based on this tga analysis 600 c was selected as an optimal calcination temperature for 3dz which allowed pva and water free 3dzc zeolite y structure while preserving its crystallinity this was further confirmed via xrd analysis which is shown in fig 3b xrd spectrum of 3dzc contains all the peaks corresponding to cbv100 and the nanoclay confirming excellent microstructural retention moreover a diffuse hump in the 2θ range of 15 30 which is visible for 3dz disappeared in 3dzc confirming the removal of pva the morphology of 3dz and 3dzc structures as revealed by sem images is presented in fig 4a and fig 4b respectively the surface of 3dz exhibits relatively smooth and packed morphology due to the binding effect of pva occasional cracking made clearer by the zoomed in image can be attributed to slight shrinkage under ambient drying however the interior reveals a relatively loose morphology where the particles are connected via pva strands as far as 3dzc is concerned both the outer and inner regions are characterized by open pore structure which was expected due to the removal of pva which served as a binding agent in 3dz such structure is desirable as it allows greater penetration of contaminated water and hence a greater adsorption of target species fig 5a shows the bet isotherms for 3dz and 3dzc structures where the hysteresis in both curves represents their microporous nature higher adsorption and desorption for the given relative pressure along with a greater hysteresis for 3dzc as compared to 3dz confirms its greater pore volume and microporosity which is in agreement with the sem results shown earlier the bet ssa for 3dz and 3dzc was found to be 275 m2 g and 384 m2 g respectively which supports better adsorption properties for 3dzc due to the removal of pva the dft pore size distribution for the two samples is presented in fig 5a where it can be seen that the calcination step provided significant pore refinement with a greater pore volume which is highly desirable for improved adsorption 3 3 heavy metals removal the column setup used for testing the metal removal efficiency of 3dzc presented in fig 6a allowed easy assembling and disassembling along with convenient mounting and dismounting of 3dzc the upper and the lower halves of the column were assembled with the help of clear silicon which ensured a leak proof column and easy disassembling after each experiment as the clear silicon can be easily peeled off as shown in fig 6b the hyperboloid like shape of 3dzc provides a cork like effect i e self sealing and easy mounting and dismounting on the lower half of the column as evident from fig 6c 3dzc remained stable and maintained its overall shape and integrity even after several water treatment regeneration and drying cycles the water treatment experiments were conducted using a 25 ppm stock solution of either pb or cu that acted as the contaminated water samples the efficiency of 3dzc in capturing pb and cu from the contaminated water is presented in fig 7 in the column setup the contact time of water can be maximized by minimizing the solution flow rate and vice versa the effect of solution flow rate on the final concentration of treated water is shown in fig 7a the solution ph was maintained at 7 0 5 for the variable flow rate experiments as expected the lower flow rate resulted in a better removal efficiency due to an increased contact duration of water with 3dzc although the flow rates employed are significantly low the metal removal efficiency is above 80 and 90 for cu and pb respectively which is very encouraging from the practical perspective the lowest flow rate of 0 5 ml min which provided the best results was maintained to study the effect of solution ph and the results are shown in fig 7b as evident the removal efficiency especially for cu can be further improved by adjusting the solution ph at ph 5 the removal efficiency is above 95 for both cu and pb which highlights the significance of solution chemistry the effect of ph is in good agreement with the results reported earlier where maximum removal efficiency for pb and cu was observed in the ph range of 5 7 while using zeolite y 43 and natural zeolite 44 as metal sorbents at low ph reduced metal sorption can be ascribed to the higher concentration of hydrogen ions that compete with metal ions as exchangeable cations on the zeolite surface 45 on the other hand light decrease in the removal efficiency at a higher ph can be attributed to the partial precipitation of pb and cu ions in the form of hydroxides that reduces their adsorption 46 as shown in fig 8b the lowest concentrations obtained for cu and pb in the treated water at ph 5 are 1 1 and 0 27 ppm respectively these values are close to the regulatory limits for cu and pb in the drinking and the agricultural water respectively 47 the adsorption capacity of zeolites which is defined as the weight of metal uptake per unit weight of zeolite is an important parameter to measure their metal removal performance based on the results presented in fig 7 the adsorption capacity of 3dzc as a function of solution flow rate and ph are plotted in fig 8b and c respectively in general better absorption capacity was observed for pb under all flow rates which represents greater affinity of zeolite y towards pb as compared to cu the effect of flow rate however is marginal which represents the saturation of 3dzc with metal ions under the given solution conditions the effect of ph is noticeable in case of pb as the adsorption capacity was found to be highest and more consistent when the solution ph was maintained at 5 at the same time it is important to highlight that the metal adsorption capacities shown in fig 8 are an order of magnitude lower as compared to the values reported by other researchers for similar types of zeolites 36 43 48 this can be primarily attributed to the absence of any physical or chemical modifications in the current zeolite y that are vital to achieve the metal adsorption capacity as high as 10 1000 mg g 49 moreover the use of nanoclay as a binder will cause an overall decline in the adsorption capacity of 3dzc as the nanoclay possess much lower crystallinity and ssa as compared to zeolite y 820 m2 g vs 78 m2 g the kinetics of heavy metal adsorption by 3dzc was modeled using pseudo second order equation which governs the heavy metal adsorption by zeolites in most cases 43 50 in the linear form the pseudo second order kinetic model is given as t q t 1 kq e 2 t q e where qe and qt are the adsorbed amounts of metal ions at equilibrium and at time t respectively expressed as mg g k is the rate constant expressed as g mg 1 min 1 for second order adsorption by plotting t qt vs t the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe and constant k can be determined from the intercept and slope respectively fig 9a shows the plot of pseudo second order equation where the qe value for pb and cu was found to be 8 3 and 7 8 mg g respectively which are in good agreement with the adsorption capacity values shown in fig 8 also the r2 value close to 1 for both pb and cu confirms that 3dzc follows the pseudo second order kinetic model which is based on the chemisorption phenomenon the selectivity of 3dzc towards pb and cu was analyzed by using a stock solution prepared by mixing equal volumes of 25 ppm pb and cu solutions and the results are shown in fig 9b as evident 3dzc showed higher selectivity towards pb except at ph 5 where the concentration values are quite close which is in agreement with the selectivity results obtained earlier in case of various natural and synthetic zeolites 51 53 this is generally attributed to differences in metal characteristics and the resultant affinity for sorption sites the higher electronegativity 2 3 vs 1 9 and a smaller hydrated radius 4 01 å vs 4 19 å of pb as compared to cu are considered as the primary reasons for preferential pb adsorption over cu into the porous zeolite network 54 55 the cyclic performance of 3dzc in terms of the treated water concentration and the adsorption capacity after 10 regeneration cycles is presented in fig 10a and b respectively as evident the the performance drops significantly after the first treatment cycle which can be attributed to the permanent sorption of metal ions at some active sites thereby decreasing the amount of metal adsorbed during the second treatment 56 however during the subsequent treatment cycles a gradual but slight decrease in the metal removal efficiency and the adsorption capacity reflects repeatable performance of 3dzc it is expected that after prolonged usage and repeated cycling 3dzc will become saturated with heavy metals and can no longer be used as adsorbent at this point it can be disposed according to the environmental guidelines for the heavy metal containing waste as the zeolite itself is a non toxic material and the toxic element i e the heavy metals will govern the disposal method the overall performance of 3dzc i e removal of more than 95 of the heavy metal from the contaminated water is an encouraging aspect which can be attributed to its porous and 3d structure which was achieved due to the combined effect of 3d printing and calcination using additives in the paste formation that can further enhance the macro porosity in 3d printed zeolite can lead to improved adsorption capacity moreover optimizing the polymer composition and the calcination parameters temperature heating cooling rate can significantly contribute to the porosity and microstructure of 3d printed zeolite and hence its adsorption capacity whereas the metal removal efficiency of 3d printed zeolite y shown above is encouraging there are plenty of parameters that can be addressed and optimized for performance enhancement the key aspect is the type of zeolite that is being used for 3dp as the metal sorption capacity varies significantly from one zeolite to another for instance clinoptilolite has been the most widely investigated natural zeolite for heavy metal removal depending upon the relative si al ratio physical and chemical properties and surface modification excellent selectivity of clinoptilolite for various heavy metals such as pb cu fe co cd and ni has been reported by several researchers 57 59 variety of other naturally occurring zeolites such as mordenite and chabazite have also been reported for their significant metal sorption capacity 26 similarly wide range of synthetic zeolites such as zsm 5 60 61 lta 62 and zeolite y 63 64 have shown much enhanced selectivity for different heavy metals due to their better microstructural and compositional characteristics in addition as summarized in the review article by shi et al 65 different forms of acidic basic and surfactant based modifications of both natural and synthetic zeolites drastically improve their metal uptake capacity the initial metal concentration is also an important variable which strongly influences the adsorption capacity of zeolites 66 as the wastewater composition can vary greatly depending upon the source and the geographical location for example within the uae itself the cu and pb concentration varied in the range of 0 05 166 ppm and 0 02 0 44 ppm respectively in the wastewater samples collected from only eight different factories 67 therefore analyzing the adsorption capacity of 3d printed zeolites as a function of varying initial metal concentrations and the corresponding compositional optimization while ensuring good 3d printability is another direction of potential research the selection of appropriate binder for 3d printed zeolites is another critical aspect although clay serves as an excellent binder for zeolite it causes significant reduction in the ssa due to several reasons firstly the original ssa of clays is significantly lower as compared to zeolites which eventually leads to reduction in the ssa of the 3d printed composite secondly the heat treatment of zeolite clay composites results in complex physical and chemical interactions between the two species that deteriorate the pore structure of zeolites along with the formation of hard interfacial layer between the clay and zeolite particles that provides the binding affect at the cost of zeolite pores blockage 68 the same was supported by the results obtained in this work where 3d printing and addition of clay caused significant reduction in the original ssa of zeolite y 820 m2 g vs 384 m2 g which will eventually lead to reduction in the adsorption capacity however the unique benefits offered by 3d printed zeolites are better mechanical integrity and customized shapes that allow their facile incorporation in continuous flow processes without the need of any post filtration steps moreover as discussed above the reduction in the ssa can be compensated by a suitable surface modification of 3d printed zeolites that can restore their original adsorption capacity the solution conditions such as the ph initial concentration and temperature are known to strongly influence the ion exchange capability of zeolites 69 and hence these variables can be further optimized to achieve enhanced metal sorption in 3d printed zeolites in addition to the type of zeolite and solution properties the role of 3d printing for performance optimization cannot be overlooked by optimizing the paste composition and rheological properties zeolite structures with greater length and more sophisticated geometries can be fabricated that will allow greater and prolonged contact with contaminated water leading to increased metal uptake also the geometrical flexibility offered by 3dp allows for fabricating zeolite structures with complicated shapes and morphologies to suit the operational needs of various water treatment plants finally it should be emphasized that the current use of zeolites in the form of packed beds leads to substantial pressure drop during the continuous flow experiments to overcome this issue 3d printing provides a unique solution by allowing facile fabrication of zeolite structures with an open channel structure and a greater aspect ratio that can greatly reduce the pressure drop leading to improved process efficiency besides heavy metals removal the potential of 3d printed zeolites can be further explored in the variety of other water treatment applications such as water softening ammonia capture and the removal of dissolved and emulsified organics 4 conclusions in summary 3dp of zeolite y was successfully demonstrated for the first time with zeolite content as high as nearly 80 wt the compositional optimization of zeolite paste allowed smooth and prolonged printing resulting in 3d printed structures with impressive geometric conformity when calcined at 600 c to remove polymeric additives these 3d printed zeolite y structures displayed high surface area with mesoporosity along with excellent structural integrity and shape retention in a column type configuration these structures served as excellent metal adsorbents by providing pb and cu removal efficiencies above 90 under optimal solution flow rate and ph moreover the 3d printed zeolite y structures retained their structure and performance even after several water treatment cycles therefore this work demonstrates that compositional optimization allows 3d printing of zeolites in different shapes and geometries that can be integrated with the continuous flow systems for large scale water treatment and purification operations further research on the compositional and operational optimizations will allow better 3d printed zeolites that can be applied at the industrial scale for wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors have no conflicts of

13491,zeolites in the form of monolithic and well defined structures offer great opportunity as potential adsorbents to remediate various environmental pollutants in this work zeolite y structures were fabricated via 3d printing technique and their potential was demonstrated for removing toxic heavy metals from wastewater using a lab scale column type configuration the mesoporous 3d printed zeolite structures were tested as adsorbents for heavy metals such as lead and copper that are known toxic pollutants normally present in the variety of industrial wastewaters the results indicate that 3d printed zeolite y structures can reduce the concentration of lead and copper by more than 90 under optimal ph and low flow rate conditions in addition the structures remained stable with a repeatable performance after several water treatment cycles this study therefore demonstrates the potential of 3d printing technology to fabricate zeolites in the desired geometries that can be

achieve enhanced antifouling filtration separation and output flux wide range of water treatment applications have been studied with relevance to 3dp such as ultrafiltration 10 11 microfiltration 12 13 reverse osmosis 14 oil water separation 15 and dye degradation adsorption 16 and the reported results have been very encouraging as far as 3dp technique is concerned for water treatment most of the studies are based on selective laser sintering sls fused deposition modelling fdm and digital light processing dlp which is primarily due to their high spatial resolution that is required for most water separation and purification devices 17 however these accurate and precise 3dp techniques offer limited materials variety and require significantly expensive hardware that limits their use at the commercial scale on the contrary direct ink writing diw is a much more economical 3dp technique that offers unlimited materials variety design flexibility and demands limited operator skills however at the cost of reduced spatial resolution 18 the potential of diw based 3dp has been explored in several water treatment applications where the spatial resolution is of a lesser concern and a reasonably stable structure with a well defined morphology and sub millimeter resolution is able to adsorb repel the target pollutant from wastewater for instance clay structures fabricated via diw exhibited excellent reduction in turbidity and bacterial concentration when used as filters in a lab scale column type setup for wastewater treatment 19 similarly porous polymeric meshes with well defined geometries printed via diw provided excellent oil water separation efficiency with a high flux throughput 20 these studies provide strong motivation to develop further structural components and devices using diw by employing new and un conventional materials that are effective in different water treatment applications moreover investigations on different fillers and additives that can impart suitable rheological properties for improved diw extrudability flowability and buildability are crucial for upscaling the use of 3dp in water industry among the range of materials used for water treatment and purification zeolites have been widely employed due to their excellent ion exchange and adsorption properties which are attributed to their mesoporosity and three dimensional porous nature at the molecular scale 21 due to their net negative surface charge zeolites have been particularly effective in adsorbing cationic pollutants from wastewater these include nh4 ions that are abundant in the municipal wastewater and heavy metal ions such as zn2 cr2 pb2 cd2 cu2 and as3 that are among the toxic pollutants present in the groundwater and variety of industrial wastewaters in particular zeolites have been extensively studied and applied for removing heavy metals due to their excellent selectivity and adsorbing efficiency that can be further tuned via different modifying agents such as acids or bases inorganic salts and cationic surfactants 22 to date large number of studies has been published reporting high efficiency of both natural and synthetic zeolites as heavy metal adsorbents a comprehensive review by yuan 23 summarizes variety of zeolites and their metal removal efficiency from wastewater as reported by various researchers over the past few decades global increase in carcinogenesis and neurological diseases among humans and their direct link to excessive heavy metals intake 24 has led to the development of strict protocols for maximum allowable concentration of heavy metals in drinking water as well as the water that is directly used by the food industries 25 this ultimately triggered and accelerated a widespread research for developing efficient materials and technologies to remediate different heavy metals in natural and industrial wastewaters zeolites being the efficient and well known materials for capturing heavy metals consequently require greater attention so that they can be applied at the industrial scale for continuous and efficient removal of heavy metals from wastewater in general there are two ways in which the zeolites can be employed for capturing heavy metals from aqueous media batch and column process 26 in the batch process a certain quantity of zeolite powder is brought in contact with the contaminated water via rigorous mixing followed by the separation of zeolite via filtration the removal efficiency of the target heavy metal is governed by the contact time mixing speed and the solution temperature and ph on the contrary the column process involves a continuous flow of wastewater streams over the zeolite packed beds and the removal efficiency of the heavy metals is again mainly dependent upon several factors such as the solution temperature ph and flow rate as evident due to the massive volumes of wastewater and high throughput requirement the column type configuration is more applicable at the industrial scale and therefore it is important to find suitable methods by which the zeolites can be integrated in columns and other continuous flow systems for fast and efficient removal of heavy metals from waste water driven by this motivation and utilizing the potential of 3dp zeolite y structures were fabricated via diw of zeolite y paste containing nanoclay and other additives to achieve appropriate rheology for consistent 3d printability to the best of our knowledge 3d printed zeolites with good structural integrity that are capable of removing heavy metals from water in a continuous flow process have not been reported so far the 3d printed zeolite y structures were tested in a lab scale column type configuration for their metal capturing efficiency from the contaminated water as an example we selected lead pb and copper cu as our target heavy metal pollutants pb is among the highly toxic metals which are well known for causing serious damage to kidneys and liver and inducing various forms of cancers in humans 27 excess levels of cu are also responsible for causing damage to organs as well as the digestive and nervous system in humans 28 the regulatory limits of pb and cu in the drinking water according to the us environmental protection agency epa are 0 015 ppm and 1 3 ppm respectively 29 the 3d printed zeolite y structures investigated in this study were capable of reducing pb and cu concentrations in the aqueous media to a level close to these regulatory limits 2 experimental methods 2 1 materials and mixing the zeolite y used in this study was cbv100 zeolite international usa for which the specific surface area ssa was found to be 820 m2 g this type of synthetic zeolite in which na acts as an exchange ion has been found to be effective in capturing heavy metals from aqueous media 30 31 bentonite nanoclay sigma aldrich usa was used as a compatible binder for zeolite which also helped in improving the 3d printability this particular type of clay has been found to be effective for binding and mechanical integrity of different 3d printed zeolites 32 33 polyvinyl alcohol pva mw 195 000 sigma aldrich usa was added to impart some viscoelasticity to the zeolite paste while hydroxyethyl cellulose sigma aldrich usa was added as a suspension aid additive saa to maintain the paste homogeneity during 3dp small amount of non ionic surfactant also termed as defoamer coatex usa was added to avoid air entrapment in the paste deionized water milliq was used as a liquid for paste formation to produce a homogenous 3d printable mix the solid components cbv100 nanoclay and saa were first dry mixed in a planetary ball mill xqm 2a tencan china for 30 min to obtain a homogenous powder mix while the liquid components 10 wt pva solution in water and the defoamer were separately mixed using a magnetic stirrer to obtain a homogenous liquid solution this solution was then added to the jars containing the mixed powders followed by 30 min of mixing zirconia jars and balls were used for ball mixing maintaining the speed of 300 rpm and balls to paste weight ratio of nearly 4 1 this procedure resulted in a homogenous paste that provided consistent and repeatable 3d printing table 1 summarizes the paste composition that was subsequently 3d printed 2 2 rheology rheological properties of the freshly prepared 3d printable zeolite paste were determined using a rotational rheometer mcr72 anton paar gmbh austria equipped with a 25 mm diameter parallel plate measuring system before starting the experiment the paste was placed on the static plate while the rotating plate was brought in contact with the paste maintaining the distance of 1 mm between the two plates the shear stress and viscosity of the freshly prepared paste were determined under the shear rates of 1 10 s 1 while the time dependent shear stress and viscosity were determined via linear fitting of the shear stress vs shear rate curves that were obtained after varying time intervals 2 3 3d printing zeolite y paste was 3d printed using a high resolution 3d printer engine hr hyrel3d usa equipped with a 5 ml syringe dispensing head sds 5 structures were designed in a hyperboloid like shape which allowed facile integration and removal of the structures during the column based water treatment experiments the 3d printable zeolite paste was transferred to a 5 ml syringe and mounted on the 3d printer head for subsequent printing the g code understandable by the printer interface was generated through slic3r software while using the nozzle diameter layer height and printing speed of 0 4 mm 0 3 mm and 2 mm s respectively aligned rectilinear infill pattern was selected with 15 infill with only 1 perimeter which served as an outer boundary of the object this resulted in the material extrusion rate that corresponds to the shear rate of nearly 1 5 s 1 during the printing process the resulting printing duration was about 90 min during which the paste maintained its flow consistency once 3dp was complete the structures were left undisturbed overnight on the 3d printer stage for drying leading to enough solidification of zeolite y for manual handling the 3d printed zeolite samples obtained at this stage were named as 3dz 2 4 heat treatment after overnight drying the printed structure was calcined to remove pva and other additives to determine an optimal calcination temperature thermogravimetric analysis tga of the starting powders and 3dz was conducted using simultaneous thermal analyzer sdt q600 ta instruments usa in the temperature range of 25 1000 c maintaining the heating rate of 10 c min the calcination was performed in a box furnace at 600 c for 2 h using the temperature ramp rate of 5 c min after the calcination cycle the furnace was allowed to reach the room temperature naturally the 3d printed calcined zeolite obtained at this stage was named as 3dzc since 3dzc underwent calcination at 600 c four out of six components used for paste preparation i e pva saa defoamer and water were completely removed as the decomposition evaporation temperature of these four components lies well below 600 c the final 3dzc structure comprises of only zeolite y cbv100 and the nanoclay with a relative weight percentage of 78 5 and 21 5 respectively 2 5 morphology and microstructure the ssa and porosity of the samples were measured using a helium sorption system nova 4200e quantachrome instruments austria the ssa was calculated using the well known brunauer emmett teller bet method while the pore size distribution was determined using the density functional theory dft which is generally more accurate for the mesoporous materials 34 the inner and the outer morphology of the samples was examined using a scanning electron microscope sem quanta 450 fei netherlands operating at an accelerating voltage of 10 kv prior to sem imaging the samples were coated with a 50 nm layer of gold to avoid any charging issues powder x ray diffraction pxrd analysis empyrean panalytical uk was used for determining the crystalline structure of the raw powders 3dz and 3dzc fine ground to powder state the spectra were collected using cu kα radiation λ 1 54 å in the 2θ range of 5 60 with a step size of 0 05 and the data collection time of 200 s per step 2 6 column experiments 3dzc were tested for their metal removal efficiency from aqueous media in a simple lab scale column type setup a 100 ml burette with a valve and a stop cork was cut close to the valve side where 3dzc was mounted to act as an adsorbing agent the hyperboloid shape of 3dzc allowed easy placement and removal during each experiment as well as a self sealing effect ensuring that all the contaminated water passes through its channels after maximum contact the other half of the burette was then attached to the assembly and the junction was sealed with a clear silicon that ensured a leak free column setup stock solutions of pb and cu with a concentration of 25 ppm were prepared in the di water by diluting 1000 ppm standard pb and cu solutions provided by sigma aldrich these stock solutions acted as contaminated water samples that were passed through 3dzc using the column setup described above the experiments were conducted under varying flow rates and ph using 50 ml of contaminated water in each experiment the flow rate ultimately controlled the contact time of water with 3dzc while the effect of ph was important as it strongly influences the metal adsorbing efficiency of zeolites the flow rate of the contaminated water was controlled through the valve while the ph was controlled by adding an appropriate amount of 1 m hno3 solution depending upon the flow rate used the duration of the adsorption study varied from 15 to 100 min the treated water samples were collected in a graduated cylinder and then subsequently analyzed for their heavy metal concentration after each experiment the column was disassembled by peeling of the clear silicon and easy removal of 3dzc before the next experiment 3dzc was regenerated by immersing in 0 5 m nacl solution for 5 h with frequent stirring followed by washing with di water this simple protocol has been successfully employed by several researchers for regenerating zeolite y 35 36 finally 3dzc was dried in an oven at 80 c in an oven for 2 3 h and then used for next water treatment experiments 2 7 heavy metals concentration the concentration of pb and cu in the treated water samples was analyzed using the graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy aas system ice3000 thermo fisher scientific usa equipped with an automated sample handling and loading facility metal specific hollow cathode lamps served as a radiation source while the background correction was achieved via deuterium lamp radiation as recommended by the equipment manufacturer appropriate amount of ammonium nitrate solution was used as a modifier to achieve better accuracy in the concentration values 37 three measurements were done for each sample and the concentration results were reported with standard deviation the metal concentration of the treated water and the starting stock solution also allowed for the calculation of 3dzc absorption capacity ac through the following commonly used relation ac c i c f v m where ci and cf are the initial and final solution concentrations respectively v is the volume of the treated solution and m is the mass of zeolite present in 3dzc it is important to realize the role of nanoclay which is present in 3dzc in adsorbing pb and cu because some clays have been reported as effective metal sorbents due to their porous and 3d molecular structure 38 however clays are effective only after certain modifications as their natural state exhibits limited ion exchange capability 39 to clarify this aspect we conducted an initial experiment by stirring equal amount of nanoclay and zeolite y in pb and cu containing water and observed negligible adsorbing efficiency of nanoclay as compared to zeolite y therefore the nanoclay present in 3dzc structure solely acts as a binder while the zeolite y plays the main role as metal sorbent 3 results and discussion 3 1 rheology and 3d printing for the materials in a paste like form and that are relatively new for 3dp it is vital to examine and quantify their rheological properties to pave the way towards their improved and repeatable 3dp zeolites are relatively new in this domain and only few publications have reported 3d printed zeolite structures as adsorbents for different gases and organic species 32 33 however the rheological behavior of these zeolite pastes was not reported fig 1a shows the dynamic viscosity and shear stress of the freshly prepared 3d printable zeolite y paste used in this study under low shear rates the exponential decay of viscosity with an increasing shear rate shows the shear thinning behavior which is further supported by the shear stress trend where the critical shear stress of about 76 pa was observed at the shear rate of approximately 0 8 s 1 upon further increase in the shear rate the shear stress increases almost linearly while the dynamic viscosity stabilizes at nearly 15 pa s linear fitting of the shear stress data in the shear rate range of 1 10 s 1 provided the shear yield stress and plastic viscosity of 87 1 pa and 6 8 pa s respectively as shown through the first data points at time 0 min in fig 1b similar shear stress vs shear rate curves were obtained after increasing time intervals and the calculated values of shear yield stress and plastic viscosity are shown via remaining data points in fig 1b the shear stress increases almost linearly with time due to the gradual drying and hardening of zeolite paste accordingly the plastic viscosity also increases however at a much faster pace during the first hour as compared to the later period the parameters selected for 3d printing correspond to the shear rate of nearly 1 5 s 1 and the printing duration of about 90 min during this period 3dp remained consistent and the 3d printer head was able to provide smooth and continuous extrusion for the plastic viscosity values that prevailed for the paste in addition the shear strength that developed over time as the paste dried out was high enough to ensure the structural integrity of 3d printed zeolite y the computer aided design cad model of the hyperboloid like object that was 3d printed is shown in fig 2a while the corresponding sliced model that was subsequently converted to the g code for 3dp is shown in fig 2b the 3d printed and dried zeolite y structure 3dz shown in fig 2c reflects good shape conformance with respect to the actual cad model slight increase in the diameter and decrease in the length can be attributed to the combined compression effect caused by the weight of each subsequently printed layer after calcination at 600 c the zeolite y structure 3dzc retained its shape and integrity with a slight shrinkage as shown in fig 2d which can be attributed to the loss of pva and the adsorbed water also the texture changed from whitish to brownish after calcination due to the removal of pva and hence a greater contribution of brownish clay to the overall texture as compared to 3dz 3dzc was slightly more brittle which is expected due to the loss of polymer however despite this brittleness 3dzc maintained its integrity and uniformity even after several handling and testing cycles the calcination step was necessary to remove the pva and impart greater porosity to the structure the trial experiments in this work showed that despite some porosity the 3dz structure exhibit poor metal adsorption concentration of 25 ppm pb stock solution reduced to only 19 3 ppm at flow rate 0 5 ml min and ph 5 which can be attributed to the blockage of active sites caused by the pva molecules moreover physical destabilization was observed during the adsorption experiments due to the solubility of pva in water only after the calcination step the structure exhibited physical stability along with higher porosity and surface area and hence an appreciable metal absorption capacity thus for the materials like zeolite whose performance is primarily governed by their porosity and sorption properties the addition of polymer is required solely for viscoelasticity to facilitate their 3dp after consolidation the polymer must be removed to restore the microstructure and hence the desired properties 32 also heat treatment below the recrystallization temperature is recommended for zeolites prior to their use as it improves their crystallinity and mesoporosity by removing the adsorbed water and other impurities 40 3 2 morphology and microstructure the tga analysis of the starting materials and 3dz which allowed the selection of optimal calcination temperature is shown in fig 3a the cbv100 underwent nearly 16 weight loss up till 300 c which corresponds to the loss of physically and chemically adsorbed water in the case of nanoclay the weight loss due to dehydration is about 8 which continues up till 700 c due to the strongly bonded water in the molecular interstices which is in agreement with the tga studies conducted for similar types of clays 41 however zeolite y undergoes significant loss in crystallinity at temperatures above 700 c 42 and therefore the calcination temperature must be limited to preserve its microstructure 3dz underwent a weight loss of about 25 representing a combined dehydration of zeolite y and nanoclay along with the decomposition of pva which is evident in the form of a sharp weight loss in the temperature range of 300 400 c based on this tga analysis 600 c was selected as an optimal calcination temperature for 3dz which allowed pva and water free 3dzc zeolite y structure while preserving its crystallinity this was further confirmed via xrd analysis which is shown in fig 3b xrd spectrum of 3dzc contains all the peaks corresponding to cbv100 and the nanoclay confirming excellent microstructural retention moreover a diffuse hump in the 2θ range of 15 30 which is visible for 3dz disappeared in 3dzc confirming the removal of pva the morphology of 3dz and 3dzc structures as revealed by sem images is presented in fig 4a and fig 4b respectively the surface of 3dz exhibits relatively smooth and packed morphology due to the binding effect of pva occasional cracking made clearer by the zoomed in image can be attributed to slight shrinkage under ambient drying however the interior reveals a relatively loose morphology where the particles are connected via pva strands as far as 3dzc is concerned both the outer and inner regions are characterized by open pore structure which was expected due to the removal of pva which served as a binding agent in 3dz such structure is desirable as it allows greater penetration of contaminated water and hence a greater adsorption of target species fig 5a shows the bet isotherms for 3dz and 3dzc structures where the hysteresis in both curves represents their microporous nature higher adsorption and desorption for the given relative pressure along with a greater hysteresis for 3dzc as compared to 3dz confirms its greater pore volume and microporosity which is in agreement with the sem results shown earlier the bet ssa for 3dz and 3dzc was found to be 275 m2 g and 384 m2 g respectively which supports better adsorption properties for 3dzc due to the removal of pva the dft pore size distribution for the two samples is presented in fig 5a where it can be seen that the calcination step provided significant pore refinement with a greater pore volume which is highly desirable for improved adsorption 3 3 heavy metals removal the column setup used for testing the metal removal efficiency of 3dzc presented in fig 6a allowed easy assembling and disassembling along with convenient mounting and dismounting of 3dzc the upper and the lower halves of the column were assembled with the help of clear silicon which ensured a leak proof column and easy disassembling after each experiment as the clear silicon can be easily peeled off as shown in fig 6b the hyperboloid like shape of 3dzc provides a cork like effect i e self sealing and easy mounting and dismounting on the lower half of the column as evident from fig 6c 3dzc remained stable and maintained its overall shape and integrity even after several water treatment regeneration and drying cycles the water treatment experiments were conducted using a 25 ppm stock solution of either pb or cu that acted as the contaminated water samples the efficiency of 3dzc in capturing pb and cu from the contaminated water is presented in fig 7 in the column setup the contact time of water can be maximized by minimizing the solution flow rate and vice versa the effect of solution flow rate on the final concentration of treated water is shown in fig 7a the solution ph was maintained at 7 0 5 for the variable flow rate experiments as expected the lower flow rate resulted in a better removal efficiency due to an increased contact duration of water with 3dzc although the flow rates employed are significantly low the metal removal efficiency is above 80 and 90 for cu and pb respectively which is very encouraging from the practical perspective the lowest flow rate of 0 5 ml min which provided the best results was maintained to study the effect of solution ph and the results are shown in fig 7b as evident the removal efficiency especially for cu can be further improved by adjusting the solution ph at ph 5 the removal efficiency is above 95 for both cu and pb which highlights the significance of solution chemistry the effect of ph is in good agreement with the results reported earlier where maximum removal efficiency for pb and cu was observed in the ph range of 5 7 while using zeolite y 43 and natural zeolite 44 as metal sorbents at low ph reduced metal sorption can be ascribed to the higher concentration of hydrogen ions that compete with metal ions as exchangeable cations on the zeolite surface 45 on the other hand light decrease in the removal efficiency at a higher ph can be attributed to the partial precipitation of pb and cu ions in the form of hydroxides that reduces their adsorption 46 as shown in fig 8b the lowest concentrations obtained for cu and pb in the treated water at ph 5 are 1 1 and 0 27 ppm respectively these values are close to the regulatory limits for cu and pb in the drinking and the agricultural water respectively 47 the adsorption capacity of zeolites which is defined as the weight of metal uptake per unit weight of zeolite is an important parameter to measure their metal removal performance based on the results presented in fig 7 the adsorption capacity of 3dzc as a function of solution flow rate and ph are plotted in fig 8b and c respectively in general better absorption capacity was observed for pb under all flow rates which represents greater affinity of zeolite y towards pb as compared to cu the effect of flow rate however is marginal which represents the saturation of 3dzc with metal ions under the given solution conditions the effect of ph is noticeable in case of pb as the adsorption capacity was found to be highest and more consistent when the solution ph was maintained at 5 at the same time it is important to highlight that the metal adsorption capacities shown in fig 8 are an order of magnitude lower as compared to the values reported by other researchers for similar types of zeolites 36 43 48 this can be primarily attributed to the absence of any physical or chemical modifications in the current zeolite y that are vital to achieve the metal adsorption capacity as high as 10 1000 mg g 49 moreover the use of nanoclay as a binder will cause an overall decline in the adsorption capacity of 3dzc as the nanoclay possess much lower crystallinity and ssa as compared to zeolite y 820 m2 g vs 78 m2 g the kinetics of heavy metal adsorption by 3dzc was modeled using pseudo second order equation which governs the heavy metal adsorption by zeolites in most cases 43 50 in the linear form the pseudo second order kinetic model is given as t q t 1 kq e 2 t q e where qe and qt are the adsorbed amounts of metal ions at equilibrium and at time t respectively expressed as mg g k is the rate constant expressed as g mg 1 min 1 for second order adsorption by plotting t qt vs t the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe and constant k can be determined from the intercept and slope respectively fig 9a shows the plot of pseudo second order equation where the qe value for pb and cu was found to be 8 3 and 7 8 mg g respectively which are in good agreement with the adsorption capacity values shown in fig 8 also the r2 value close to 1 for both pb and cu confirms that 3dzc follows the pseudo second order kinetic model which is based on the chemisorption phenomenon the selectivity of 3dzc towards pb and cu was analyzed by using a stock solution prepared by mixing equal volumes of 25 ppm pb and cu solutions and the results are shown in fig 9b as evident 3dzc showed higher selectivity towards pb except at ph 5 where the concentration values are quite close which is in agreement with the selectivity results obtained earlier in case of various natural and synthetic zeolites 51 53 this is generally attributed to differences in metal characteristics and the resultant affinity for sorption sites the higher electronegativity 2 3 vs 1 9 and a smaller hydrated radius 4 01 å vs 4 19 å of pb as compared to cu are considered as the primary reasons for preferential pb adsorption over cu into the porous zeolite network 54 55 the cyclic performance of 3dzc in terms of the treated water concentration and the adsorption capacity after 10 regeneration cycles is presented in fig 10a and b respectively as evident the the performance drops significantly after the first treatment cycle which can be attributed to the permanent sorption of metal ions at some active sites thereby decreasing the amount of metal adsorbed during the second treatment 56 however during the subsequent treatment cycles a gradual but slight decrease in the metal removal efficiency and the adsorption capacity reflects repeatable performance of 3dzc it is expected that after prolonged usage and repeated cycling 3dzc will become saturated with heavy metals and can no longer be used as adsorbent at this point it can be disposed according to the environmental guidelines for the heavy metal containing waste as the zeolite itself is a non toxic material and the toxic element i e the heavy metals will govern the disposal method the overall performance of 3dzc i e removal of more than 95 of the heavy metal from the contaminated water is an encouraging aspect which can be attributed to its porous and 3d structure which was achieved due to the combined effect of 3d printing and calcination using additives in the paste formation that can further enhance the macro porosity in 3d printed zeolite can lead to improved adsorption capacity moreover optimizing the polymer composition and the calcination parameters temperature heating cooling rate can significantly contribute to the porosity and microstructure of 3d printed zeolite and hence its adsorption capacity whereas the metal removal efficiency of 3d printed zeolite y shown above is encouraging there are plenty of parameters that can be addressed and optimized for performance enhancement the key aspect is the type of zeolite that is being used for 3dp as the metal sorption capacity varies significantly from one zeolite to another for instance clinoptilolite has been the most widely investigated natural zeolite for heavy metal removal depending upon the relative si al ratio physical and chemical properties and surface modification excellent selectivity of clinoptilolite for various heavy metals such as pb cu fe co cd and ni has been reported by several researchers 57 59 variety of other naturally occurring zeolites such as mordenite and chabazite have also been reported for their significant metal sorption capacity 26 similarly wide range of synthetic zeolites such as zsm 5 60 61 lta 62 and zeolite y 63 64 have shown much enhanced selectivity for different heavy metals due to their better microstructural and compositional characteristics in addition as summarized in the review article by shi et al 65 different forms of acidic basic and surfactant based modifications of both natural and synthetic zeolites drastically improve their metal uptake capacity the initial metal concentration is also an important variable which strongly influences the adsorption capacity of zeolites 66 as the wastewater composition can vary greatly depending upon the source and the geographical location for example within the uae itself the cu and pb concentration varied in the range of 0 05 166 ppm and 0 02 0 44 ppm respectively in the wastewater samples collected from only eight different factories 67 therefore analyzing the adsorption capacity of 3d printed zeolites as a function of varying initial metal concentrations and the corresponding compositional optimization while ensuring good 3d printability is another direction of potential research the selection of appropriate binder for 3d printed zeolites is another critical aspect although clay serves as an excellent binder for zeolite it causes significant reduction in the ssa due to several reasons firstly the original ssa of clays is significantly lower as compared to zeolites which eventually leads to reduction in the ssa of the 3d printed composite secondly the heat treatment of zeolite clay composites results in complex physical and chemical interactions between the two species that deteriorate the pore structure of zeolites along with the formation of hard interfacial layer between the clay and zeolite particles that provides the binding affect at the cost of zeolite pores blockage 68 the same was supported by the results obtained in this work where 3d printing and addition of clay caused significant reduction in the original ssa of zeolite y 820 m2 g vs 384 m2 g which will eventually lead to reduction in the adsorption capacity however the unique benefits offered by 3d printed zeolites are better mechanical integrity and customized shapes that allow their facile incorporation in continuous flow processes without the need of any post filtration steps moreover as discussed above the reduction in the ssa can be compensated by a suitable surface modification of 3d printed zeolites that can restore their original adsorption capacity the solution conditions such as the ph initial concentration and temperature are known to strongly influence the ion exchange capability of zeolites 69 and hence these variables can be further optimized to achieve enhanced metal sorption in 3d printed zeolites in addition to the type of zeolite and solution properties the role of 3d printing for performance optimization cannot be overlooked by optimizing the paste composition and rheological properties zeolite structures with greater length and more sophisticated geometries can be fabricated that will allow greater and prolonged contact with contaminated water leading to increased metal uptake also the geometrical flexibility offered by 3dp allows for fabricating zeolite structures with complicated shapes and morphologies to suit the operational needs of various water treatment plants finally it should be emphasized that the current use of zeolites in the form of packed beds leads to substantial pressure drop during the continuous flow experiments to overcome this issue 3d printing provides a unique solution by allowing facile fabrication of zeolite structures with an open channel structure and a greater aspect ratio that can greatly reduce the pressure drop leading to improved process efficiency besides heavy metals removal the potential of 3d printed zeolites can be further explored in the variety of other water treatment applications such as water softening ammonia capture and the removal of dissolved and emulsified organics 4 conclusions in summary 3dp of zeolite y was successfully demonstrated for the first time with zeolite content as high as nearly 80 wt the compositional optimization of zeolite paste allowed smooth and prolonged printing resulting in 3d printed structures with impressive geometric conformity when calcined at 600 c to remove polymeric additives these 3d printed zeolite y structures displayed high surface area with mesoporosity along with excellent structural integrity and shape retention in a column type configuration these structures served as excellent metal adsorbents by providing pb and cu removal efficiencies above 90 under optimal solution flow rate and ph moreover the 3d printed zeolite y structures retained their structure and performance even after several water treatment cycles therefore this work demonstrates that compositional optimization allows 3d printing of zeolites in different shapes and geometries that can be integrated with the continuous flow systems for large scale water treatment and purification operations further research on the compositional and operational optimizations will allow better 3d printed zeolites that can be applied at the industrial scale for wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors have no conflicts of

graphitic like carbon nitride adsorption efficiency methylene blue dye 1 introduction polymer nanocomposites have a wide range of applications such as water treatment and biomedical uses 1 2 because of their special chemical mechanical thermal optical electrical and biological characteristics 3 4 polymer nanocomposite preparations have been reported in many works employing various nanoparticles 5 silver nanowires zinc oxide 6 graphene oxide 7 gold 8 diverse techniques have been developed to yield polymer nanocomposite such as solution casting evaporation 9 melt blending 10 sol gel technique 4 and in situ polymerization 10 in recent times the nanocomposite based on natural polymeric materials has gained an extensive attention in loading active materials the polysaccharides and their derivatives pay more concern because of their features of biodegradability inherent non toxicity abundance inexpensiveness and the multiple functional sites 11 13 hence in order to enhance the characteristics of the nanocomposite adsorbent based on polysaccharides such as swelling adsorption capacity and enhanced strength of the polymer network which are very critical for their possible applications in many fields as well as adsorption of hazardous materials from waste water some physical and chemical modifications are necessary 14 15 the combination of synthetic polymers with polysaccharides reflects significant strategies to enhance the properties of polysaccharides based adsorbents the grafting 16 is one of those strategies such as acrylic based synthetic polymers like methacrylic acid acrylic acid and acrylamide which is synthesized through graft copolymerization 17 and crosslinking 18 20 in the past few decades these materials have been broadly utilized as perfect adsorbents for eliminating synthetic dyes from water through several mechanisms such as hydrogen bonding ion exchange and physisorption electrostatic and hydrophobic interaction between the polysaccharides based graft network and the dye molecules with high selectivity similarly nanomaterials with a stacked two dimensional 2d structure were displayed exceptional thermal adsorption capacity and mechanical properties as the fillers in the synthesis of composite polymers 21 the typical two dimensional stacked nanosheets graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 that contains nh2 and nh groups 22 has been reported to have hydrogen bonds to form polymer nanocomposite 23 25 owing to the structural similarity between graphene and zno g c3n4 the embedding of zno g c3n4 could contribute to enhance thermal mechanical and adsorption capacity of the hydrogel 26 moreover the embedding of such stacked two dimensional nanoparticles composites into the polymer matrices have been reported as a motivate methodology to enhance the removal and selectivity of dyes 27 wang and his team have fabricated an eco friendly and smart polyvinyl alcohol carboxymethyl cellulose graphitic like carbon nitride g c3n4 hydrogel reinforced with cellulose nanocrystals via green cyclic freeze thaw process the mechanical properties of the hydrogel were positively improved by changing g c3n4 concentrations and the methylene blue adsorption efficacy qe exceeded 198 6 mg g 28 this research offered a simple method involving preparation of a physically cross linked double network using fecl3 6h2o as a cross

nanoparticles were collected by the centrifuge and dried at 60 c for 24 h for further analysis 29 2 3 preparation of polyacrylic acid grafted hydroxyethyl cellulose and polyvinyl alcohol zno g c3n4 fe3 the physically cross linked polyacrylic acid grafted hydroxyethyl cellulose and polyvinyl alcohol containing zno g c3n4 was synthesized through free radical polymerization using ammonium persulfate aps as an initiator and ferric chloride as a cross linker at 60 c within 20 min briefly hec and polyvinyl alcohol 2 w v 1 1 weight ratio were dissolved in distilled water at 60 c with

c3n4 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite have been tuned by the means of molecular engineering of poly acrylic acid co polyvinyl with hydroxyethyl cellulose through the physical cross linker ferric chloride hexahydrate to enhance adsorption of hazardous dyes from waste water the conventional thermal condensation route has been devoted to synthesize zno graphitic carbon nitride zno g c3n4 melamine and zinc acetate hexahydrate as precursors the steps and the overall results were outlined in scheme 2 3 1 attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy atr ir the interaction between zno and g c3n4 to form zno g c3n4 nanocomposite and the functional groups of g c3n4 and their nanocomposites zno g c3n4 paa g hec pva fe3 and zno g c3n4 paa g hec pva fe3 were investigated as presented in fig 1 for g c3n4 there are multiple bands which can be assigned to different bands which are characteristic for carbon nitrides in general the sharp peak at 804 cm 1 can be ascribed to the out of plane bending mode of either triazine or heptazine rings 31 the fingerprint region between 1232 and 1629 cm 1 shows various absorption maxima for imide and nitride stretching vibrations 32 around 1260 cm 1 the characteristic band for the cnhc unit is found the bands at 3300 and 3158 cm 1 are related to nh stretching vibrations the bands at 1397 1452 and 1549 cm 1 may be owed to heptazine derived repeating units 33 34 the consistent peaks of zno g c3n4 as well as g c3n4 could be existed in the zno g c3n4 nanocomposite and no other peaks appear which evidences that the zno g c3n4 nanocomposite is successfully prepared with high purity the zno c3n4 paa g hec pva fe3 exhibited multiple characteristic absorption bands with corresponding bands related to zno g c3n4 evidences the successful formation of zno c3n4 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite for example intense peak at 804 cm 1 which is part of the bending vibration of the triazine rings 31 the peak at 3253 cm 1 was associated with oh stretching vibration the peak in the 1411 cm 1 zone matched to symmetric and symmetric coo stretching vibrations of carboxylate groups of polyacrylic acid the band at 603 cm 1 are predominant in paa g hec pva fe3 and zno c3n4 paa g hec pva fe3 are attributable to vibrations bonds of o fe3 arises from coordination of fe3 with oh groups of pva and o atom of ether group of hec and coo of paa 35 3 2 x ray diffraction the xrd analysis is shown in fig 2 it displays xrd patterns of zno g c3n4 zno g c3n4 neat paa g hec pva fe3 and zno c3n4 paa g hec pva fe3 as shown the typical diffraction peaks at 2 theta of 31 72 34 37 36 20 47 49 56 54 62 80 and 66 05 for zno matching to the 100 002 101 102 110 103 and 112 crystal planes of zno nanoparticles the unique diffraction peaks at 2 theta equals 12 87 for g c3n4 belongs to the diffraction plane 100 corresponding to in plane packing mode and the other one at 27 42 originated from the 002 stacking structure due to the accumulation of the conjugated aromatic system 27 similarly zno g c3n4 nanocomposite showed the same two diffraction peaks at 12 87 and the other at 27 42 the appearance of an intense peak at 2 theta 47 49 revealed the successful synthesis of zno g c3n4 via conventional thermal condensation synthesis procedures 36 37 for parent paa g hec pva fe3 the xrd pattern of hec exhibits two characteristic peaks at 11 18 and 20 73 however after embedding zno g c3n4 a diffraction peak at 27 71 was evidently detected for the zno c3n4 paa g hec pva fe3 3 3 transmission electron microscopy herein transmission electron microscopy technique was employed for indicating investigation of nanostructure of the as prepared zno g c3n4 nanocomposite fig 3 gives tem pictures of pure zno g c3n4 and zno g c3n4 tem pictures showed loosely thin and soft sheets like morphology of porous structures the stacking arrangement of thin layer sheets was observed this porous morphology was as a result of bubbles arising from co2 nh3 and h2o gases produced and burst during the pyrolysis and condensation reactions it is expected that these nonporous structures are favorable to increase more active sites on the surface consequently absorption capacity will be enhanced as clear from the pictures bare zno nanoparticles show rods like structures average width of the nanorods is within the range of 40 to 140 nm zno nanorods were slightly adsorbed on g c3n4 the electron diffraction rings array given in the inset of the fig 3 approves the polycrystalline nature of g c3n4 and zno g c3n4 respectively 38 39 3 4 morphological investigation sem eds for supplementary analysis of morphological studies sem was employed fig 4 shows the sem images of zno g c3n4 native paa g hec pva fe3 and zno c3n4 paa g hec pva fe3 zno g c3n4 shows a typical stacked multilayered sheet like surface morphology of graphitic carbon nitride corresponding to the in plane structural packing pattern of either triazine or heptazine rings building blocks the well defined zno nanorods are observed in the zno g c3n4 sample this result validates the sharp x ray diffraction pattern observed due to good crystalline quality in the case zno g c3n4 sample the presence of zno nanorods leads into a stalked interlinked network the sem image of zno g c3n4 reveals that the hydrothermal interaction between zinc acetate and melamine leads into a loose structure a high surface area and porous surface which probably occurred due to the effect of released gases during the thermal polymerization reaction 40 eds pattern for zno g c3n4 revealed that it consisted of elements o c n and zn the elements o n c and zn were found to be well defined and showed a sharp contrast zno elements are well dispersed homogeneously and efficiently throughout the results confirmed the efficacious construction of the zno g c3n4 nanocomposite 41 according to the micrograph sequence which is presented in fig 4 the grafted polyacrylic acid seems as small deposits of irregular patches on the hec pva eds spectrum of zno g c3n4 paa g hec pva fe3 showed a sharp contrast of elements of c n zn and fe the eds results assured that zno g c3n4 was well embedded into paa g hec pva fe3 3 5 swelling ratios the swelling ratios of zno g c3n4 paa g hec pva fe3 containing different amounts of zno g c3n4 in deionized water as a function of time at room temperature were shown in fig 5a the capability of the studied nanocomposites to uptake water and other fluids arises from the existing coo functional groups of the polymer however the swelling ratios of nanocomposites are continuously augmented after the incorporation of zno g c3n4 nanosheets that creating porous structures with a greater surface area the zno g c3n4 nanosheets contain hydrophilic sites that contribute in hydrophilicity enhancement of the nanocomposite surface and promote water diffusion all the studied nanocomposite samples have a positive trend with time water uptake increases with time progress the samples exhibit the biphasic swelling behavior namely slow swelling rate at the start time then swelling increases rapidly with increasing time up to 5 h followed by almost steady swelling pattern within the last hours the swelling ratio increases with increasing content of zno g c3n4 nanosheets the zno g c3n4 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite containing 6 zno g c3n4 exhibits the highest water uptake reading nearly 13 48 0 51 g g after 6 h however paa g hec pva fe3 showed the highly reduced swelling ratio given approximately 6 38 0 55 g g after 6 h these observations could be owed to the over crosslinking reasons the over crosslinking hinders the polymer chain mobility and thereby declines the water uptake the swelling degree of zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposites in buffer solutions with time at diverse ph degree was displayed in fig 5 zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposites exhibits declined swelling ratio 5 86 0 32 and 7 49 0 42 g g at lower ph 3 0 and 5 0 respectively this trend may be ascribed to the most carboxylic groups coo having been protonated leading into more generation of hydrogen bonds among oh cooh and zno g c3n4 thereby the graft tends to shrink producing a graft of a lower water uptake however as the ph degree increased from 3 to 11 the swelling degree of zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposites increased given 13 18 0 42 and 14 51 0 42 g g belonging to ph 9 0 and 11 0 respectively these observations might be attributable to most cooh groups were ionized and changed into coo and more hydrogen bonds were dissociated and the anionic electrostatic repulsions of coo groups enhanced intensely along the polymer backbone therefore the swelling ability of the nanocomposite enhanced noticeably the swelling kinetics of zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite in deionized water was investigated using a pseudo second order fitting model the swelling rate at t was expressed as presented in eq 4 4 d w d t k wa w 2 integration of eq 4 for t 0 t and w 0 wt gives eq 5 5 1 we w k t 1 we and then eq 5 was rearranged to obtain a linear relation eq 6 6 t w 1 we 1 k we 2 where w was the sample s swelling ratio at time t we was the sample s swelling ratio at equilibrium and k was the rate constant apparently the plot of t w against t will yield a straight line with an intercept of 1 k we2 and a slop of 1 we hence the swelling ratio we and the swelling rate constant k would be calculated by the intercept and slop respectively 42 fig 5c showed the pseudo second order kinetics of zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite and table 1 presented fitting swelling kinetic parameters of zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 at diverse ph values as shown in fig 7 the plot of t w against t exposed a very straight line with higher r 2 0 9 as seen in table 1 indicating the well fitted experimental data with the theoretical pseudo second order model consistent with table 1 the theoretical data of swelling ratios w e fit g g were almost near enough to the experimental data w e exp g g and the swelling rate k h 1 of zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite in the higher ph 9 to 11 is lower than ph 3 5 with the higher swelling ratios indicating the nanocomposite could swell more quickly in the higher ph means it would take short time to reach equilibrium the zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite exhibited k 0 1148 h 1 and we 15 772 0 00173 g g at ph 11 0 however exposed k 0 2554 h 1 and we 6 439 0 0048 g g at ph 3 0 3 6 mechanical properties the compressive strength measurements and its related young s modulus and compressive strain are important criteria to qualify resistance and withstanding during handling in water treatment of nanocomposites the compressive strength at limit of zno g c3n4 paa g hec pva fe3 containing variable contents of zno g c3n4 in swollen state and its young s modulus were demonstrated in fig 6 the compressive strength showed a positive relationship with increasing zno g c3n4 content however the compressive strain exhibited the reverse trend the zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 has the higher compressive strength 4 74 0 09 mpa and young s modulus 1 822 0 054 mpa lower compressive strain 33 78 1 54 these findings may be owed to over crosslinking reasons caused by the filler zno g c3n4 that increase network density leading to increasing compressive strength and young s modulus and decreasing polymer compressive strain thereby allows less flexibility and increase rigidity of the polymer chain leading to decreasing strain 43 3 7 adsorption studies fig 7 showed the adsorption capacity of mb q t versus time over zno g c3n4 paa g hec pva fe3 and zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposites adsorbent at constant mb adsorbate concentration 20 mg l and adsorbent dose 300 mg 100 ml and ph 6 5 all studied nano composites showed biphasic removal trend namely slow removal rate at the beginning minutes then increases rapidly followed by a slowly increase and finally reaches steady removal rate within the last minutes among the studied nano composites zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 was the most efficient and fast nano composite for removal of mb given q t 178 88 0 23 mg g up to 50 min as seen in fig 7 pure zno g c3n4 nanosheet has the lowest removal of mb and only 87 34 1 79 of mb is adsorbed up to 75 min however the mb adsorbed completely by zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite and reached 100 2 06 up to 50 min on other hand paa g hec pva fe3 adsorbed mb to 100 1 41 up to 75 min the adsorption mechanism of mb by zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 compared with paa g hec pva fe3 was mainly based on two interaction comprising intermolecular hydrogen bonding and π π stacking orientations the aryl structures have a tendency to form π π stacking interactions in face to face and or edge to face positions the embedding of zno g c3n4 into paa g hec pva fe3 polymer allows the formation of the π π stacking with mb thereby mb could be definitely adsorbed onto the polymer surface additionally a large number of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups are present on zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite surface containing o atom that behaves as a good hydrogen acceptor and is responsible for hydrogen bonding formation with n and s ions in mb molecules 27 according to this context paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite exhibited the lowermost adsorption capacity possibly will be a large number of coo and oh were occupied in formation of coordinated bonds with fe3 thus the number of hydrogen bonds between the polymer and mb decreases and adsorption decreases to examine the kinetic performance of mb dye adsorption process from aqueous solution using zno g c3n4 paa g hec pva fe3 and zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 the linear and nonlinear pseudo first order and pseudo second order model kinetic 44 respectively were used as expressed in table 2 where qe and qt are the quantity of adsorbate mg g at equilibrium and time t in minutes and k 1 is the adsorption specific rate constant min 1 of pseudo first order reaction k 2 is the rate constant of pseudo second order reaction 42 fig 8 represents fitting of adsorption process by zno g c3n4 hec g paa co pam fe3 and hec g paa co pam fe3 zno g c3n4 nanocomposites using linear and nonlinear pseudo first order and second order reaction all the curves are not fitted with the experimental values as seen in fig 8 the linear first order is not fitted with the experimental data while the linear second order is well fitted as seen in table 3 the specific rate constants of linear and nonlinear first order were 2 92 0 006 10 2 1 27 0 003 10 2 min 1 and 0 354 0 004 10 2 1 062 0 008 10 2 min 1 respectively the specific rate constants of linear and nonlinear second order were within the range 1 57 0 001 10 4 6 4 0 004 10 4 and 1 54 2 89 10 5 8 34 10 5 g mg 1 min 1 respectively as present in table 4 the higher rate constants of linear and nonlinear second order of zno g c3n4 paa hec pva fe3 are 6 4 0 004 10 4 and 8 34 10 5 g mg 1 min 1 according to table 3 the linear pseudo first order curves are with low correlation coefficient values r 2 within 0 905 0 866 however nonlinear showed higher correlation coefficient r 2 within 0 972 0 993 as seen in table 4 the fitted q e values of linear model are not consistent with experimental data the fitted linear and nonlinear qe belongs to zno g c3n4 paa hec pva fe3 were 55 88 5 18 and 185 44 7 66 mg g compared with experimental 185 44 7 6 mg g the nonlinear first order model is the more acceptable however both the nonlinear first and second order curves are with high correlation coefficient values r 2 within 0 972 0 993 and 0 985 0 999 respectively as seen in table 4 the predicted q e values of second order reaction in both linear and nonlinear models of zno g c3n4 paa hec pva fe3 are 204 08 0 003 and 200 00 1 27 mg g that are almost agreeable with experimental data 185 44 7 66 mg g these findings indicate that the linearization of the models has no significant on kinetic parameters the linear and nonlinear second order reaction showed higher correlation coefficient ranging from 0 974 to 0 999 and 0 985 to 0 999 respectively there is no significant difference between fitted linear and nonlinear values 204 08 0 003 and 200 0 1 27 mg g respectively compared with 185 44 7 66 this indicated that the linearization of second order model has no significant on the predicted results therefore the nonlinear second order model is more applicable than nonlinear first order thus it is recommended to follow the nonlinear model to describe the kinetic adsorption because the transformation of nonlinear to linear form leads into remarkable changes to the units of the y and x axes the advantage of nonlinear models is that the error distribution does not change as it does in linear methods 45 the higher dye adsorption rate in case of the zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 could be attributed to the higher density of electron sites generated by in situ incorporation of zno g c3n4 nanosheets into paa g hec pva fe3 thereby improve the adsorption capacity 3 7 1 effect of zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 dose variation on adsorption capacity fig 9 showed the adsorption capacity of mb by zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite as a function of dose variation at constant mb concentration 20 mg l and ph 6 5 the adsorption capacity showed diphasic trend adsorption capacity first increases and then it gives a plateau trend with progress of time as the adsorbent dose increases the adsorption capacity of mb increases this trend is owing to the increasing of active sites mb adsorbed by zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite gives a plateau trend with increasing time indicating complete occupied active sites zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite of 300 mg 100 ml dose exhibits the highest adsorption capacity given 100 2 3 up to 60 min compared with 93 33 2 5 for 200 mg 100 ml and 86 66 1 7 for 100 mg 100 ml doses up to 75 min respectively 46 3 7 2 effect of initial concentration of mb dye on adsorption capacity using zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 the influence of change in adsorption capacity qt with time at different mb concentrations at constant load of zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 300 mg 100 ml and ph 6 5 is shown in the fig 10a initial concentration was varied from 10 to 50 mg l the adsorption capacity with change of initial concentration varies from 107 86 6 32 to 325 42 13 23 mg g the higher adsorption capacity by zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 300 mg 100 ml was at 30 mg l mb given 325 42 13 23 mg g 47 3 7 3 effect of ph on mb adsorption capacity using zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite fig 10b showed the effect of changing ph of the mb solution on the adsorption capacity qt with time using constant load of zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 300 mg 100 ml and mb concentrations 20 mg 100 ml the adsorption capacity efficiency increases with increasing ph degree zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite exhibited the higher adsorption capacity at ph 9 0 given 216 82 6 41 mg g up to 60 min however it gives adsorption capacity 127 70 5 5 mg g at ph 3 0 these results are aligned with the claim of a great number of carboxylic groups were ionized at higher ph and the electron density and negativity of carboxylic groups increase thereby the binding affinity of mb dye to the negatively active sites increased in this context many mechanisms have been suggested to clarify the adsorption of mb by zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 polymer containing graphitic carbon nitride included hydrogen bonding physical electrostatic and acid base interactions cation release and π π stacking the electrostatic acid base interactions and π π stacking were usually claimed as mechanisms for elucidating the adsorption manners of mb dye the mechanisms of acid base and electrostatic interactions was investigated by exploring the adsorption capacities of nanocomposite zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 on mb at diverse ph environments as discussed before the zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 graft has poor adsorption ability at lower ph and higher adsorption at higher ph the positively charged mb dye could be electrostatically bind to cooh groups of the graft at higher ph the positively charged mb could easily electrostatically attracted to the negatively charged carboxyl groups in the zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 graft the reduced adsorption capacity of zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 at low ph 3 5 was attributable to the protonation of coo in the graft to cooh thus the hydrogen bonding between cooh and oh is enriched in the graft leading into more crosslinking and the graft tends to be denser and shrinks thereby the dye molecules were further hindered from diffusing into the graft surface moreover coo in the graft polymer may possibly bind to a vast numbers of h in the solution decreasing the adsorption of positively mb dye 48 3 7 4 adsorption isotherm the adsorption isotherm of mb adsorbed by zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite was studied by variable concentrations of mb dye solutions 10 20 30 40 and 50 mg l with a fixed dose of adsorbent 300 mg 100 ml and ph 9 0 to check the sorption isotherm the linear and nonlinear three models langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherm equations were applied 49 the linear and nonlinear isotherm equations were tabulated in table 2 where c e is the liquid phase concentration mg l at equilibrium q e is the amount of adsorbate unit weight mg g qmax is the maximum monolayer coverage capacity mg g and k l is the langmuir constant associated with the rate of adsorption and adsorption capacity respectively 50 l f is freundlich constant n is the adsorption intensity a t is temkin isotherm equilibrium binding constant lg 1 bt is temkin isotherm constant associated with adsorbate adsorbent interactions r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k 1 t is temperature 303 k b is a constant correlated to heat of sorption and is calculated as j mol 1 rt bt 51 for a supplementary analysis of the langmuir equation a dimensionless equilibrium parameter separation factor r l could be calculated according to the given equation eq 9 9 r l 1 1 bc o where b l mg is the langmuir constant and co mg l is the initial concentration of adsorbate if the rl value lies in the range of 0 1 the adsorption will be favorable but if the rl is more than 1 the adsorption will be unfavorable in the case of rl 1 it means a linear adsorption but at rl 0 it represents irreversible adsorption 52 53 fig 11 showed the adsorption capacity at equilibrium qe of zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite versus equilibrium mb concentration ce the correlation of qe versus ce showed a diphasic pattern at the start qe increases rapidly with increasing of ce and then it starts to decline slowly and finally it showed steady trend given 301 31 9 33 mg g at ce 11 98 mg l linear and nonlinear isotherms plots are denoted in fig 11 respectively are the langmuir freundlich and temkin models respectively and isotherm parameters for mb adsorption by zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite were cited in table 5 langmuir isotherm model claims that the adsorption exhibits a monolayer with uniform adsorption energy the adsorption takes place only at a finite number of certain localized sites 51 the linear and nonlinear langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherm models exhibited higher correlation coefficient r 2 the correlation coefficients r 2 were 0 996 and 0 9573 values of linear and nonlinear langmuir isotherm respectively for freundlich r 2 0 951 and 0 9271 respectively and temkin isotherms r 2 0 965 and 0 9738 respectively the isotherm parameters obtained from linear and nonlinear langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherm models have no significant differences no significant difference between the maximum monolayer coverage capacities obtained from linear and nonlinear langmuir models qmax were 313 47 0 00319 and 307 42 14 83 mg g respectively compared with experimental qmax 301 26 0 319 mg g for freundlich constants kf were 157 50 0 0322 and 169 21 16 78 for linear and nonlinear respectively and absorption intensities values n were 4 04 0 32 and 4 75 0 93 however the temkin parameters exhibited significant differences between the linear and nonlinear models temkin isotherm equilibrium binding constants a t were 170 76 9 26 and 36 07 17 76 l g 1 for linear and nonlinear respectively and temkin isotherm constants bt associated with adsorbate adsorbent interactions were 47 62 0 45 and 0 0201 0 002 for linear and nonlinear respectively the nonlinear error function chi square χ2 was used in order to evaluate models according to the next equation eq 10 10 chi square statistics χ 2 q e exp q e cal 2 q e cal if the experimental data of the model are closer to the predicted data of the model χ2 will be a small number indicating good fitting however if the predicted data are not closer to the experimental data χ2 will be high number no well fitting will be obtained the nonlinear langmuir showed the lower error distribution chi square χ2 value 388 98 compared with freundlich and temkin 665 31 and 738 79 respectively can produce an acceptable fit to the experimental data indicating the suitability of langmuir model accordingly the most acceptable model is the nonlinear langmuir model additionally the langmuir constant k l was obtained from linear and nonlinear langmuir models were 1 236 and 1 345 l g respectively the high value of k l revealed strong adsorption of mb dye by zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 graft also the value of rl was within the range of 0 0159 0 0748 which represents a good adsorption capacity thereby zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite is an excellent candidate for removal of mb 52 these findings revealed that mb adsorption by zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite obeys the monolayer adsorption mode rather than the multilayer one in other words the sorption occurs at specific homogeneous active sites on the polymer coo and at the equilibrium no further adsorption can occur at that site this shows good adsorption aptitude of mb by zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite 3 8 thermodynamics study there is a positive correlation between the maximum adsorption capacity at equilibrium qe and increasing temperature within the range 298 318 k the maximum qe 321 45 0 87 was achieved at a temperature 318 k thus to demonstrate the thermodynamic performance of the mb dye adsorption process from aqueous solution using zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite thermodynamic parameters of entropy δs enthalpy δh and gibbs free energy δg were used as seen in equations eqs 11 12 44 11 ln k d δg rt δs r 12 δg rt ln k d where kd is qe ce equilibrium constant r is the general gas constant 8 314 j mol k t absolute temperature k to calculate δh and δs values the slope and intercept of the ln kd plot against 1 t were used respectively and the estimated parameters are stated in table 6 44 the enthalpy δh value for mb dye adsorption using zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite were 27 49 kj mol positive δh reveals that the process exhibits endothermic in the temperature range of 298 318 k using zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite the positive value of entropy δs parameter value was proposing that the random collisions of mb dye molecules at the solute solution interface increases with the adsorbent surface in the course of the adsorption process a negative value of gibbs free energy shows thermodynamics feasibility and spontaneity of the sorption process by zno g c3n4 paa g hecpva fe3 which will be promoted by specific temperature conditions leading to increased adsorption capacity 54 comparison of adsorption capacity of mb by zno g c3n4 paa g hec pva fe3 nano composite films with other sorbents is showed in table 7 results present the highest and the closer qmax to some sorbents for mb compared to the other sorbents in the powder phase the material is promising and can be applied for water treatment as a good sorbent 3 9 the proposed adsorption mechanism the adsorption of methylene blue mb by zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite hydrogel can be clarified as they involved hydrogen bonding physical and acid base interactions π π stacking and electrostatic attraction acid base electrostatics interactions and π π stacking were constantly suggested as mechanisms for illumination the adsorption performance of charged organic compounds having benzene rings the mechanism of electrostatic acid base interactions illustrated through the adsorption possessions of hydrogels on mb under different ph environments in scheme 3 the prepared hydrogel has a poor adsorption capacity for mb at lower ph but when the ph increased upto 6 10 the hydrogel has a good adsorption to mb mb is a basic cationic dye has charge in the construction and could be electrostatically attracted to the coo carboxyl groups in the hydrogel firstly the lower extent of adsorption in lower ph 1 5 was related to the coo protonation in the hydrogel the existence of a huge extent of cooh is harmful to the binding to the cationic dye molecules while the hydrogen bonding between cooh and oh is enriched in the hydrogel films also coo in the hydrogel can bind to a huge extent of h in the solution reducing the adsorption of dye cations as the ph rises the cooh in ionized to coo and the films have negative ve charged is higher than ve positive dye charged molecule so the electrostatic attraction is appeared and increased dramatically at higher ph 7 9 the mb dye is extremely adsorbed and all cooh ionized to coo the proposed mechanisms of mb adsorption using zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 are completely matching with literature 60 61 3 9 1 π π stacking interactions the xps spectra of the c1s high resolution of the samples before and after mb the adsorption were investigated and the collaboration between the graphitic carbon nitride and mb was investigated fig 12a the 1st the single and double bonds of carbon with carbon cc cc at 284 58 ev the 2nd carbon with alcohols and amines co cn at 286 4 ev the 3rd the carbon attributable to carboxyl group as coor oco at 288 2 ev the 4th the single carbon sulfur bond csc which related to mb and appeared at 288 9 ev with a proportion of 4 0 after mb adsorption the proportion of cc cc peak in the graphitic carbon nitride gel increases from 76 55 to 82 29 respectively while the co cn proportion decreased from 12 98 to 7 4 respectively and the proportion oco peak decreased from 10 47 to 6 26 respectively this is owing to the mb particles adsorbed on the graphitic carbon nitride gel bearing in mind that the existence of aromatic parts of mb fragments and ligands graphitic carbon nitride the π π stacking interactions will show a dynamic part in the adsorption of mb in graphitic carbon nitride gels 62 3 9 2 hydrogen bonding hydrogen bonding between graphitic carbon nitride adsorbents and the adsorbate as pollutants is a vital mechanism for adsorption of organic pollutants 63 64 it must be distinguished that both the graphitic carbon nitride adsorbents and mb adsorbate have abundant h donor and acceptor moieties as oh and nh2 groups therefore hydrogen bonding seems to play a significant automatic character throughout the adsorption of mb on graphitic carbon nitride to investigate the hydrogen bonding between graphitic carbon nitride gel and mb the difference of functional terminal groups before and after adsorption was discussed by xps spectroscopy the spectrum of the o1s of the graphitic carbon nitride gel is contained of five peaks fig 12b the 1st the metal oxide bond feo or ionic oxygen bonds o2 which appear at 530 ev the 2nd the oxygen double bond and carboxyl carbon co at 531 7 ev the 3rd the hydrogen bonding oxygen o h appear at 532 4 ev the 4th the hydroxyl oxygen connect to carbon coh at 532 8 ev and the 5th the coc ether oxygen atom appear at 533 6 ev associated with the xps range of graphitic carbon nitride gel before adsorption the ratio of o h bond increased considerably after adsorption from 3 26 to 36 22 and an important improvement in the coc ether oxygen bond increased from 1 7 to 3 39 while the proportion of coh bond decreased from 56 dropped to 24 72 on the other hand the significant increase in the level of o h bond from 3 26 to 36 22 is related to the active adsorption of mb on the surface of the graphitic carbon nitride gel 64 furthermore the n1s high resolution xps spectra fig 13a show three disassembled peaks which are allocated to the 1st for metal nitride or carbon nitride in graphitic or carbon nitrogen in terminal fen cnc cnh2 appear at 399 6 ev the 2nd the nitrogen hydrogen oxygen bond n ho n appeared at 401 4 ev and the 3rd the nitrogen hydrogen units nh3 appeared at 402 5 ev respectively 65 an increase in the intensity of the fen cnc cnh2 peak with appearing n s bond resulting adsorption from 73 02 to 81 59 were observed while a decline in the n ho n level from 16 84 to 9 27 and also a decrease in the intensity of nh3 units were detected therefore we achieve that nh2 shows a vital progressive role in the formation of hydrogen bonding n h in the mb adsorption progression in addition the formation of new 4 peaks for the s2p3 2 high resolution xps spectra fig 13b sulfur bonds after mb adsorption which show four significant peaks are due to the 1st the carbon sulfur bond in mb or metal sulfide csc cs h fe s appeared at 163 5 ev with high intensity 38 78 the 2nd for sulfur oxygen r2so appeared at 165 2 ev with intensity 6 66 the 3rd for carbon sulfur oxygen cs os cso bonds appear at 167 9 ev with high intensity 46 05 and the 4th for carbon sulfur bond cs o3 bond appear at 169 88 ev with intensity 8 5 the formation of sulfur bonds after mb adsorption prove the formation both the π π stacking interactions with hydrogen bonding which show a vital part in the adsorption of mb in graphitic carbon nitride gels 3 9 3 synergism between graphitic carbon nitride gel and mb based on the previous obtained results we detected that the adsorption mechanism of mb was chiefly an interaction or cooperation of two or more substances result in graphitic carbon nitride gels involving π π overlapping and hydrogen bonds inter intramolecular fig 12 in the literature scientists have establish that aryl types tend to form π π stacking interactions in an edge to face or face to face direction 66 owing to the π π stacking among the graphitic carbon nitride gel and mb mb is easily adsorbed onto the surface of the graphitic carbon nitride causing in an improved in intensity of cc cc peaks as stated early the o atom is a good hydrogen acceptor and the oxygen containing collections show a significant role in hydrogen bonding in the existence of the dentate a great quantity of carboxyl groups is present on the surface of the hydrogel these groups have two oxygen units namely a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group the hydroxyl group freely to form hydrogen bonds with the n and s ions in the mb molecule oh n o hn s nh s co and n co hydrogen bonding significantly encourages the adsorption of mb by the graphitic carbon nitride gel but effects on a reduction in the number of hydroxyl groups and carbonyl groups furthermore mb has a strong ability for protons related to its lone pair of electrons n also has a tendency to display a strong affinity for protons 67 when nh2 species were presented on the surface of mb they not only made hydrogen bonds nh n with the nh2 classes in mb molecules but they moreover produced hydrogen bonds nh o and n ho with the hydroxyl groups attached to fe fig 12 causing in enlarged level of n ho n connections fig 13b as stated in the literature 65 the existence of two terminal functional groups specifically the amino and carboxylic acid groups directed to the establishment of four types of single hydrogen bonds oh n oh o nh n nh o and two kinds of double hydrogen bonds 2 oh o and 2 nh o hence the presented nh2 moieties significantly developed both of the adsorption capacity and the adsorption rate through the obvious improvement of hydrogen bonding similar results have been reported for the adsorptions of dyes and p asa over nh2 mil 101 al 67 72 4 conclusion the grafting of natural polymer adsorbents with acrylic acid and embedding stacked two dimensional zno g c3n4 nanocomposite into the paa g hec pva polymer is an inspired strategy to endorse the removal basic dyes mb

enhanced by embedding zno g c3n4 nanocomposite the swelling and adsorption properties showed response to crosslinker zno g c3n4 contents and ph the mb adsorbed completely by zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite and reached 100 2 06 up to 50 min compared with paa g hec pva fe3 100 1 41 up to 75 min at dose 3 g l for 30 mg l mb at ph 9 the linear and nonlinear kinetics and adsorption models were applied the adsorption process followed nonlinear models and langmuir model is the more applicable than freundlich and temkin the chief adsorption mechanism includes synergism between π π stacking interactions and hydrogen bonding concerning nh2 in graphitic carbon nitride zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 and mb the introduced nh2 groups on graphitic carbon nitride did not affect π π stacking connections between aryl units but significantly enhanced both the adsorption capacity through obvious hydrogen bonding improvements moreover interparticle dispersion of mb molecules have a chief part in the preliminary phase of adsorption because it was dependable fine with experimental kinetic data the leading adsorption mechanism contains the interaction of co operative π π stacking interfaces and hydrogen bonding the results have shown that the g c3n4 graphitic carbon nitride gel has good thermodynamics swelling characteristics and ability to adsorb pollutants based on active spots such as cooh and oh groups subsequently this study offers an important hypothetical and experimental base for basic leather dyes mb pollutants adsorption by graphitic carbon nitride gel in high

graphitic like carbon nitride adsorption efficiency methylene blue dye 1 introduction polymer nanocomposites have a wide range of applications such as water treatment and biomedical uses 1 2 because of their special chemical mechanical thermal optical electrical and biological characteristics 3 4 polymer nanocomposite preparations have been reported in many works employing various nanoparticles 5 silver nanowires zinc oxide 6 graphene oxide 7 gold 8 diverse techniques have been developed to yield polymer nanocomposite such as solution casting evaporation 9 melt blending 10 sol gel technique 4 and in situ polymerization 10 in recent times the nanocomposite based on natural polymeric materials has gained an extensive attention in loading active materials the polysaccharides and their derivatives pay more concern because of their features of biodegradability inherent non toxicity abundance inexpensiveness and the multiple functional sites 11 13 hence in order to enhance the characteristics of the nanocomposite adsorbent based on polysaccharides such as swelling adsorption capacity and enhanced strength of the polymer network which are very critical for their possible applications in many fields as well as adsorption of hazardous materials from waste water some physical and chemical modifications are necessary 14 15 the combination of synthetic polymers with polysaccharides reflects significant strategies to enhance the properties of polysaccharides based adsorbents the grafting 16 is one of those strategies such as acrylic based synthetic polymers like methacrylic acid acrylic acid and acrylamide which is synthesized through graft copolymerization 17 and crosslinking 18 20 in the past few decades these materials have been broadly utilized as perfect adsorbents for eliminating synthetic dyes from water through several mechanisms such as hydrogen bonding ion exchange and physisorption electrostatic and hydrophobic interaction between the polysaccharides based graft network and the dye molecules with high selectivity similarly nanomaterials with a stacked two dimensional 2d structure were displayed exceptional thermal adsorption capacity and mechanical properties as the fillers in the synthesis of composite polymers 21 the typical two dimensional stacked nanosheets graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 that contains nh2 and nh groups 22 has been reported to have hydrogen bonds to form polymer nanocomposite 23 25 owing to the structural similarity between graphene and zno g c3n4 the embedding of zno g c3n4 could contribute to enhance thermal mechanical and adsorption capacity of the hydrogel 26 moreover the embedding of such stacked two dimensional nanoparticles composites into the polymer matrices have been reported as a motivate methodology to enhance the removal and selectivity of dyes 27 wang and his team have fabricated an eco friendly and smart polyvinyl alcohol carboxymethyl cellulose graphitic like carbon nitride g c3n4 hydrogel reinforced with cellulose nanocrystals via green cyclic freeze thaw process the mechanical properties of the hydrogel were positively improved by changing g c3n4 concentrations and the methylene blue adsorption efficacy qe exceeded 198 6 mg g 28 this research offered a simple method involving preparation of a physically cross linked double network using fecl3 6h2o as a cross

presented in fig 1 for g c3n4 there are multiple bands which can be assigned to different bands which are characteristic for carbon nitrides in general the sharp peak at 804 cm 1 can be ascribed to the out of plane bending mode of either triazine or heptazine rings 31 the fingerprint region between 1232 and 1629 cm 1 shows various absorption maxima for imide and nitride stretching vibrations 32 around 1260 cm 1 the characteristic band for the cnhc unit is found the bands at 3300 and 3158 cm 1 are related to nh stretching vibrations the bands at 1397 1452 and 1549 cm 1 may be owed to heptazine derived repeating units 33 34 the consistent peaks of zno g c3n4 as well as g c3n4 could be existed in the zno g c3n4 nanocomposite and no other peaks appear which evidences that the zno g c3n4 nanocomposite is successfully prepared with high purity the zno c3n4 paa g hec pva fe3 exhibited multiple characteristic absorption bands with corresponding bands related to zno g c3n4 evidences the successful formation of zno c3n4 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite for example intense peak at 804 cm 1 which is part of the bending vibration of the triazine rings 31 the peak at 3253 cm 1 was associated with oh stretching vibration the peak in the 1411 cm 1 zone matched to symmetric and symmetric coo stretching vibrations of carboxylate groups of polyacrylic acid the band at 603 cm 1 are

peaks at 11 18 and 20 73 however after embedding zno g c3n4 a diffraction peak at 27 71 was evidently detected for the zno c3n4 paa g hec pva fe3 3 3 transmission electron microscopy herein transmission electron microscopy technique was employed for indicating investigation of nanostructure of the as prepared zno g c3n4 nanocomposite fig 3 gives tem pictures of pure zno g c3n4 and zno g c3n4 tem pictures showed loosely thin and soft sheets like morphology of porous structures the stacking arrangement of thin layer sheets was observed this porous morphology was as a result of bubbles arising from co2 nh3 and h2o gases produced and burst during the pyrolysis and condensation reactions it is expected that these nonporous structures are favorable to increase more active sites on the surface consequently absorption capacity will be enhanced as clear from the pictures bare zno nanoparticles show rods like structures average width of the nanorods is within the range of 40 to 140 nm zno nanorods were slightly adsorbed on g c3n4 the electron diffraction rings array given in the inset of the fig 3 approves the polycrystalline nature of g c3n4 and zno g c3n4 respectively 38 39 3 4 morphological investigation sem eds for supplementary analysis of morphological studies sem was employed fig 4 shows the sem images of zno g c3n4 native paa g hec pva fe3 and zno c3n4 paa g hec pva fe3 zno g c3n4 shows a typical stacked multilayered sheet like surface morphology of graphitic carbon nitride corresponding to the in plane structural packing pattern of either triazine or heptazine rings building blocks the well defined zno nanorods are observed in the zno g c3n4 sample this result validates the sharp x ray diffraction pattern observed due to good crystalline quality in the case zno g c3n4 sample the presence of zno nanorods leads into a stalked interlinked network the sem image of zno g c3n4 reveals that the hydrothermal interaction between zinc acetate and melamine leads into a loose structure a high surface area and porous surface which probably occurred due to the effect of released gases during the thermal polymerization reaction 40 eds pattern for zno g c3n4 revealed that it consisted of elements o c n and zn the elements o n c and zn were found to be well defined and showed a sharp contrast zno elements are well dispersed homogeneously and efficiently throughout the results confirmed the efficacious construction of the zno g c3n4 nanocomposite 41 according to the micrograph sequence which is presented in fig 4 the grafted polyacrylic acid seems as small deposits of irregular patches on the hec pva eds spectrum of zno g c3n4 paa g hec pva fe3 showed a sharp contrast of elements of c n zn and fe the eds results assured that zno g c3n4 was well embedded into paa g hec pva fe3 3 5 swelling ratios the swelling ratios of zno g c3n4 paa g hec pva fe3 containing different amounts of zno g c3n4 in deionized water as a function of time at room temperature were shown in fig 5a the capability of the studied nanocomposites to uptake water and other fluids arises from the existing coo functional groups of the polymer however the swelling ratios of nanocomposites are continuously augmented after the incorporation of zno g c3n4 nanosheets that creating porous structures with a greater surface area the zno g c3n4 nanosheets contain hydrophilic sites that contribute in hydrophilicity enhancement of the nanocomposite surface and promote water diffusion all the studied nanocomposite samples have a positive trend with time water uptake increases with time progress the samples exhibit the biphasic swelling behavior namely slow swelling rate at the start time then swelling increases rapidly with increasing time up to 5 h followed by almost steady swelling pattern within the last hours the swelling ratio increases with increasing content of zno g c3n4 nanosheets the zno g c3n4 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite containing 6 zno g c3n4 exhibits the highest water uptake reading nearly 13 48 0 51 g g after 6 h however paa g hec pva fe3 showed the highly reduced swelling ratio given approximately 6 38 0 55 g g after 6 h these observations could be owed to the over crosslinking reasons the over crosslinking hinders the polymer chain mobility and thereby declines the water uptake the swelling degree of zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposites in buffer solutions with time at diverse ph degree was displayed in fig 5 zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposites exhibits declined swelling ratio 5 86 0 32 and 7 49 0 42 g g at lower ph 3 0 and 5 0 respectively this trend may be ascribed to the most carboxylic groups coo having been protonated leading into more generation of hydrogen bonds among oh cooh and zno g c3n4 thereby the graft tends to shrink producing a graft of a lower water uptake however as the ph degree increased from 3 to 11 the swelling degree of zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposites increased given 13 18 0 42 and 14 51 0 42 g g belonging to ph 9 0 and 11 0 respectively these observations might be attributable to most cooh groups were ionized and changed into coo and more hydrogen bonds were dissociated and the anionic electrostatic repulsions of coo groups enhanced intensely along the polymer backbone therefore the swelling ability of the nanocomposite enhanced noticeably the swelling kinetics of zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite in deionized water was investigated using a pseudo second order fitting model the swelling rate at t was expressed as presented in eq 4 4 d w d t k wa w 2 integration of eq 4 for t 0 t and w 0 wt gives eq 5 5 1 we w k t 1 we and then eq 5 was rearranged to obtain a linear relation eq 6 6 t w 1 we 1 k we 2 where w was the sample s swelling ratio at time t we was the sample s swelling ratio at equilibrium and k was the rate constant apparently the plot of t w against t will yield a straight line with an intercept of 1 k we2 and a slop of 1 we hence the swelling ratio we and the swelling rate constant k would be calculated by the intercept and slop respectively 42 fig 5c showed the pseudo second order kinetics of zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite and table 1 presented fitting swelling kinetic parameters of zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 at diverse ph values as shown in fig 7 the plot of t w against t exposed a very straight line with higher r 2 0 9 as seen in table 1 indicating the well fitted experimental data with the theoretical pseudo second order model consistent with table 1 the theoretical data of swelling ratios w e fit g g were almost near enough to the experimental data w e exp g g and the swelling rate k h 1 of zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite in the higher ph 9 to 11 is lower than ph 3 5 with the higher swelling ratios indicating the nanocomposite could swell more quickly in the higher ph means it would take short time to reach equilibrium the zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite exhibited k 0 1148 h 1 and we 15 772 0 00173 g g at ph 11 0 however exposed k 0 2554 h 1 and we 6 439 0 0048 g g at ph 3 0 3 6 mechanical properties the compressive strength measurements and its related young s modulus and compressive strain are important criteria to qualify resistance and withstanding during handling in water treatment of nanocomposites the compressive strength at limit of zno g c3n4 paa g hec pva fe3 containing variable contents of zno g c3n4 in swollen state and its young s modulus were demonstrated in fig 6 the compressive strength showed a positive relationship with increasing zno g c3n4 content however the compressive strain exhibited the reverse trend the zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 has the higher compressive strength 4 74 0 09 mpa and young s modulus 1 822 0 054 mpa lower compressive strain 33 78 1 54 these findings may be owed to over crosslinking reasons caused by the filler zno g c3n4 that increase network density leading to increasing compressive strength and young s modulus and decreasing polymer compressive strain thereby allows less flexibility and increase rigidity of the polymer chain leading to decreasing strain 43 3 7 adsorption studies fig 7 showed the adsorption capacity of mb q t versus time over zno g c3n4 paa g hec pva fe3 and zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposites adsorbent at constant mb adsorbate concentration 20 mg l and adsorbent dose 300 mg 100 ml and ph 6 5 all studied nano composites showed biphasic removal trend namely slow removal rate at the beginning minutes then increases rapidly followed by a slowly increase and finally reaches steady removal rate within the last minutes among the studied nano composites zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 was the most efficient and fast nano composite for removal of mb given q t 178 88 0 23 mg g up to 50 min as seen in fig 7 pure zno g c3n4 nanosheet has the lowest removal of mb and only 87 34 1 79 of mb is adsorbed up to 75 min however the mb adsorbed completely by zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite and reached 100 2 06 up to 50 min on other hand paa g hec pva fe3 adsorbed mb to 100 1 41 up to 75 min the adsorption mechanism of mb by zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 compared with paa g hec pva fe3 was mainly based on two interaction comprising intermolecular hydrogen bonding and π π stacking orientations the aryl structures have a tendency to form π π stacking interactions in face to face and or edge to face positions the embedding of zno g c3n4 into paa g hec pva fe3 polymer allows the formation of the π π stacking with mb thereby mb could be definitely adsorbed onto the polymer surface additionally a large number of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups are present on zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite surface containing o atom that behaves as a good hydrogen acceptor and is responsible for hydrogen bonding formation with n and s ions in mb molecules 27 according to this context paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite exhibited the lowermost adsorption capacity possibly will be a large number of coo and oh were occupied in formation of coordinated bonds with fe3 thus the number of hydrogen bonds between the polymer and mb decreases and adsorption decreases to examine the kinetic performance of mb dye adsorption process from aqueous solution using zno g c3n4 paa g hec pva fe3 and zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 the linear and nonlinear pseudo first order and pseudo second order model kinetic 44 respectively were used as expressed in table 2 where qe and qt are the quantity of adsorbate mg g at equilibrium and time t in minutes and k 1 is the adsorption specific rate constant min 1 of pseudo first order reaction k 2 is the rate constant of pseudo second order reaction 42 fig 8 represents fitting of adsorption process by zno g c3n4 hec g paa co pam fe3 and hec g paa co pam fe3 zno g c3n4 nanocomposites using linear and nonlinear pseudo first order and second order reaction all the curves are not fitted with the experimental values as seen in fig 8 the linear first order is not fitted with the experimental data while the linear second order is well fitted as seen in table 3 the specific rate constants of linear and nonlinear first order were 2 92 0 006 10 2 1 27 0 003 10 2 min 1 and 0 354 0 004 10 2 1 062 0 008 10 2 min 1 respectively the specific rate constants of linear and nonlinear second order were within the range 1 57 0 001 10 4 6 4 0 004 10 4 and 1 54 2 89 10 5 8 34 10 5 g mg 1 min 1 respectively as present in table 4 the higher rate constants of linear and nonlinear second order of zno g c3n4 paa hec pva fe3 are 6 4 0 004 10 4 and 8 34 10 5 g mg 1 min 1 according to table 3 the linear pseudo first order curves are with low correlation coefficient values r 2 within 0 905 0 866 however nonlinear showed higher correlation coefficient r 2 within 0 972 0 993 as seen in table 4 the fitted q e values of linear model are not consistent with experimental data the fitted linear and nonlinear qe belongs to zno g c3n4 paa hec pva fe3 were 55 88 5 18 and 185 44 7 66 mg g compared with experimental 185 44 7 6 mg g the nonlinear first order model is the more acceptable however both the nonlinear first and second order curves are with high correlation coefficient values r 2 within 0 972 0 993 and 0 985 0 999 respectively as seen in table 4 the predicted q e values of second order reaction in both linear and nonlinear models of zno g c3n4 paa hec pva fe3 are 204 08 0 003 and 200 00 1 27 mg g that are almost agreeable with experimental data 185 44 7 66 mg g these findings indicate that the linearization of the models has no significant on kinetic parameters the linear and nonlinear second order reaction showed higher correlation coefficient ranging from 0 974 to 0 999 and 0 985 to 0 999 respectively there is no significant difference between fitted linear and nonlinear values 204 08 0 003 and 200 0 1 27 mg g respectively compared with 185 44 7 66 this indicated that the linearization of second order model has no significant on the predicted results therefore the nonlinear second order model is more applicable than nonlinear first order thus it is recommended to follow the nonlinear model to describe the kinetic adsorption because the transformation of nonlinear to linear form leads into remarkable changes to the units of the y and x axes the advantage of nonlinear models is that the error distribution does not change as it does in linear methods 45 the higher dye adsorption rate in case of the zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 could be attributed to the higher density of electron sites generated by in situ incorporation of zno g c3n4 nanosheets into paa g hec pva fe3 thereby improve the adsorption capacity 3 7 1 effect of zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 dose variation on adsorption capacity fig 9 showed the adsorption capacity of mb by zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite as a function of dose variation at constant mb concentration 20 mg l and ph 6 5 the adsorption capacity showed diphasic trend adsorption capacity first increases and then it gives a plateau trend with progress of time as the adsorbent dose increases the adsorption capacity of mb increases this trend is owing to the increasing of active sites mb adsorbed by zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite gives a plateau trend with increasing time indicating complete occupied active sites zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite of 300 mg 100 ml dose exhibits the highest adsorption capacity given 100 2 3 up to 60 min compared with 93 33 2 5 for 200 mg 100 ml and 86 66 1 7 for 100 mg 100 ml doses up to 75 min respectively 46 3 7 2 effect of initial concentration of mb dye on adsorption capacity using zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 the influence of change in adsorption capacity qt with time at different mb concentrations at constant load of zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 300 mg 100 ml and ph 6 5 is shown in the fig 10a initial concentration was varied from 10 to 50 mg l the adsorption capacity with change of initial concentration varies from 107 86 6 32 to 325 42 13 23 mg g the higher adsorption capacity by zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 300 mg 100 ml was at 30 mg l mb given 325 42 13 23 mg g 47 3 7 3 effect of ph on mb adsorption capacity using zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite fig 10b showed the effect of changing ph of the mb solution on the adsorption capacity qt with time using constant load of zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 300 mg 100 ml and mb concentrations 20 mg 100 ml the adsorption capacity efficiency increases with increasing ph degree zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite exhibited the higher adsorption capacity at ph 9 0 given 216 82 6 41 mg g up to 60 min however it gives adsorption capacity 127 70 5 5 mg g at ph 3 0 these results are aligned with the claim of a great number of carboxylic groups were ionized at higher ph and the electron density and negativity of carboxylic groups increase thereby the binding affinity of mb dye to the negatively active sites increased in this context many mechanisms have been suggested to clarify the adsorption of mb by zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 polymer containing graphitic carbon nitride included hydrogen bonding physical electrostatic and acid base interactions cation release and π π stacking the electrostatic acid base interactions and π π stacking were usually claimed as mechanisms for elucidating the adsorption manners of mb dye the mechanisms of acid base and electrostatic interactions was investigated by exploring the adsorption capacities of nanocomposite zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 on mb at diverse ph environments as discussed before the zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 graft has poor adsorption ability at lower ph and higher adsorption at higher ph the positively charged mb dye could be electrostatically bind to cooh groups of the graft at higher ph the positively charged mb could easily electrostatically attracted to the negatively charged carboxyl groups in the zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 graft the reduced adsorption capacity of zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 at low ph 3 5 was attributable to the protonation of coo in the graft to cooh thus the hydrogen bonding between cooh and oh is enriched in the graft leading into more crosslinking and the graft tends to be denser and shrinks thereby the dye molecules were further hindered from diffusing into the graft surface moreover coo in the graft polymer may possibly bind to a vast numbers of h in the solution decreasing the adsorption of positively mb dye 48 3 7 4 adsorption isotherm the adsorption isotherm of mb adsorbed by zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite was studied by variable concentrations of mb dye solutions 10 20 30 40 and 50 mg l with a fixed dose of adsorbent 300 mg 100 ml and ph 9 0 to check the sorption isotherm the linear and nonlinear three models langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherm equations were applied 49 the linear and nonlinear isotherm equations were tabulated in table 2 where c e is the liquid phase concentration mg l at equilibrium q e is the amount of adsorbate unit weight mg g qmax is the maximum monolayer coverage capacity mg g and k l is the langmuir constant associated with the rate of adsorption and adsorption capacity respectively 50 l f is freundlich constant n is the adsorption intensity a t is temkin isotherm equilibrium binding constant lg 1 bt is temkin isotherm constant associated with adsorbate adsorbent interactions r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k 1 t is temperature 303 k b is a constant correlated to heat of sorption and is calculated as j mol 1 rt bt 51 for a supplementary analysis of the langmuir equation a dimensionless equilibrium parameter separation factor r l could be calculated according to the given equation eq 9 9 r l 1 1 bc o where b l mg is the langmuir constant and co mg l is the initial concentration of adsorbate if the rl value lies in the range of 0 1 the adsorption will be favorable but if the rl is more than 1 the adsorption will be unfavorable in the case of rl 1 it means a linear adsorption but at rl 0 it represents irreversible adsorption 52 53 fig 11 showed the adsorption capacity at equilibrium qe of zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite versus equilibrium mb concentration ce the correlation of qe versus ce showed a diphasic pattern at the start qe increases rapidly with increasing of ce and then it starts to decline slowly and finally it showed steady trend given 301 31 9 33 mg g at ce 11 98 mg l linear and nonlinear isotherms plots are denoted in fig 11 respectively are the langmuir freundlich and temkin models respectively and isotherm parameters for mb adsorption by zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite were cited in table 5 langmuir isotherm model claims that the adsorption exhibits a monolayer with uniform adsorption energy the adsorption takes place only at a finite number of certain localized sites 51 the linear and nonlinear langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherm models exhibited higher correlation coefficient r 2 the correlation coefficients r 2 were 0 996 and 0 9573 values of linear and nonlinear langmuir isotherm respectively for freundlich r 2 0 951 and 0 9271 respectively and temkin isotherms r 2 0 965 and 0 9738 respectively the isotherm parameters obtained from linear and nonlinear langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherm models have no significant differences no significant difference between the maximum monolayer coverage capacities obtained from linear and nonlinear langmuir models qmax were 313 47 0 00319 and 307 42 14 83 mg g respectively compared with experimental qmax 301 26 0 319 mg g for freundlich constants kf were 157 50 0 0322 and 169 21 16 78 for linear and nonlinear respectively and absorption intensities values n were 4 04 0 32 and 4 75 0 93 however the temkin parameters exhibited significant differences between the linear and nonlinear models temkin isotherm equilibrium binding constants a t were 170 76 9 26 and 36 07 17 76 l g 1 for linear and nonlinear respectively and temkin isotherm constants bt associated with adsorbate adsorbent interactions were 47 62 0 45 and 0 0201 0 002 for linear and nonlinear respectively the nonlinear error function chi square χ2 was used in order to evaluate models according to the next equation eq 10 10 chi square statistics χ 2 q e exp q e cal 2 q e cal if the experimental data of the model are closer to the predicted data of the model χ2 will be a small number indicating good fitting however if the predicted data are not closer to the experimental data χ2 will be high number no well fitting will be obtained the nonlinear langmuir showed the lower error distribution chi square χ2 value 388 98 compared with freundlich and temkin 665 31 and 738 79 respectively can produce an acceptable fit to the experimental data indicating the suitability of langmuir model accordingly the most acceptable model is the nonlinear langmuir model additionally the langmuir constant k l was obtained from linear and nonlinear langmuir models were 1 236 and 1 345 l g respectively the high value of k l revealed strong adsorption of mb dye by zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 graft also the value of rl was within the range of 0 0159 0 0748 which represents a good adsorption capacity thereby zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite is an excellent candidate for removal of mb 52 these findings revealed that mb adsorption by zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite obeys the monolayer adsorption mode rather than the multilayer one in other words the sorption occurs at specific homogeneous active sites on the polymer coo and at the equilibrium no further adsorption can occur at that site this shows good adsorption aptitude of mb by zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite 3 8 thermodynamics study there is a positive correlation between the maximum adsorption capacity at equilibrium qe and increasing temperature within the range 298 318 k the maximum qe 321 45 0 87 was achieved at a temperature 318 k thus to demonstrate the thermodynamic performance of the mb dye adsorption process from aqueous solution using zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite thermodynamic parameters of entropy δs enthalpy δh and gibbs free energy δg were used as seen in equations eqs 11 12 44 11 ln k d δg rt δs r 12 δg rt ln k d where kd is qe ce equilibrium constant r is the general gas constant 8 314 j mol k t absolute temperature k to calculate δh and δs values the slope and intercept of the ln kd plot against 1 t were used respectively and the estimated parameters are stated in table 6 44 the enthalpy δh value for mb dye adsorption using zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite were 27 49 kj mol positive δh reveals that the process exhibits endothermic in the temperature range of 298 318 k using zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite the positive value of entropy δs parameter value was proposing that the random collisions of mb dye molecules at the solute solution interface increases with the adsorbent surface in the course of the adsorption process a negative value of gibbs free energy shows thermodynamics feasibility and spontaneity of the sorption process by zno g c3n4 paa g hecpva fe3 which will be promoted by specific temperature conditions leading to increased adsorption capacity 54 comparison of adsorption capacity of mb by zno g c3n4 paa g hec pva fe3 nano composite films with other sorbents is showed in table 7 results present the highest and the closer qmax to some sorbents for mb compared to the other sorbents in the powder phase the material is promising and can be applied for water treatment as a good sorbent 3 9 the proposed adsorption mechanism the adsorption of methylene blue mb by zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite hydrogel can be clarified as they involved hydrogen bonding physical and acid base interactions π π stacking and electrostatic attraction acid base electrostatics interactions and π π stacking were constantly suggested as mechanisms for illumination the adsorption performance of charged organic compounds having benzene rings the mechanism of electrostatic acid base interactions illustrated through the adsorption possessions of hydrogels on mb under different ph environments in scheme 3 the prepared hydrogel has a poor adsorption capacity for mb at lower ph but when the ph increased upto 6 10 the hydrogel has a good adsorption to mb mb is a basic cationic dye has charge in the construction and could be electrostatically attracted to the coo carboxyl groups in the hydrogel firstly the lower extent of adsorption in lower ph 1 5 was related to the coo protonation in the hydrogel the existence of a huge extent of cooh is harmful to the binding to the cationic dye molecules while the hydrogen bonding between cooh and oh is enriched in the hydrogel films also coo in the hydrogel can bind to a huge extent of h in the solution reducing the adsorption of dye cations as the ph rises the cooh in ionized to coo and the films have negative ve charged is higher than ve positive dye charged molecule so the electrostatic attraction is appeared and increased dramatically at higher ph 7 9 the mb dye is extremely adsorbed and all cooh ionized to coo the proposed mechanisms of mb adsorption using zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 are completely matching with literature 60 61 3 9 1 π π stacking interactions the xps spectra of the c1s high resolution of the samples before and after mb the adsorption were investigated and the collaboration between the graphitic carbon nitride and mb was investigated fig 12a the 1st the single and double bonds of carbon with carbon cc cc at 284 58 ev the 2nd carbon with alcohols and amines co cn at 286 4 ev the 3rd the carbon attributable to carboxyl group as coor oco at 288 2 ev the 4th the single carbon sulfur bond csc which related to mb and appeared at 288 9 ev with a proportion of 4 0 after mb adsorption the proportion of cc cc peak in the graphitic carbon nitride gel increases from 76 55 to 82 29 respectively while the co cn proportion decreased from 12 98 to 7 4 respectively and the proportion oco peak decreased from 10 47 to 6 26 respectively this is owing to the mb particles adsorbed on the graphitic carbon nitride gel bearing in mind that the existence of aromatic parts of mb fragments and ligands graphitic carbon nitride the π π stacking interactions will show a dynamic part in the adsorption of mb in graphitic carbon nitride gels 62 3 9 2 hydrogen bonding hydrogen bonding between graphitic carbon nitride adsorbents and the adsorbate as pollutants is a vital mechanism for adsorption of organic pollutants 63 64 it must be distinguished that both the graphitic carbon nitride adsorbents and mb adsorbate have abundant h donor and acceptor moieties as oh and nh2 groups therefore hydrogen bonding seems to play a significant automatic character throughout the adsorption of mb on graphitic carbon nitride to investigate the hydrogen bonding between graphitic carbon nitride gel and mb the difference of functional terminal groups before and after adsorption was discussed by xps spectroscopy the spectrum of the o1s of the graphitic carbon nitride gel is contained of five peaks fig 12b the 1st the metal oxide bond feo or ionic oxygen bonds o2 which appear at 530 ev the 2nd the oxygen double bond and carboxyl carbon co at 531 7 ev the 3rd the hydrogen bonding oxygen o h appear at 532 4 ev the 4th the hydroxyl oxygen connect to carbon coh at 532 8 ev and the 5th the coc ether oxygen atom appear at 533 6 ev associated with the xps range of graphitic carbon nitride gel before adsorption the ratio of o h bond increased considerably after adsorption from 3 26 to 36 22 and an important improvement in the coc ether oxygen bond increased from 1 7 to 3 39 while the proportion of coh bond decreased from 56 dropped to 24 72 on the other hand the significant increase in the level of o h bond from 3 26 to 36 22 is related to the active adsorption of mb on the surface of the graphitic carbon nitride gel 64 furthermore the n1s high resolution xps spectra fig 13a show three disassembled peaks which are allocated to the 1st for metal nitride or carbon nitride in graphitic or carbon nitrogen in terminal fen cnc cnh2 appear at 399 6 ev the 2nd the nitrogen hydrogen oxygen bond n ho n appeared at 401 4 ev and the 3rd the nitrogen hydrogen units nh3 appeared at 402 5 ev respectively 65 an increase in the intensity of the fen cnc cnh2 peak with appearing n s bond resulting adsorption from 73 02 to 81 59 were observed while a decline in the n ho n level from 16 84 to 9 27 and also a decrease in the intensity of nh3 units were detected therefore we achieve that nh2 shows a vital progressive role in the formation of hydrogen bonding n h in the mb adsorption progression in addition the formation of new 4 peaks for the s2p3 2 high resolution xps spectra fig 13b sulfur bonds after mb adsorption which show four significant peaks are due to the 1st the carbon sulfur bond in mb or metal sulfide csc cs h fe s appeared at 163 5 ev with high intensity 38 78 the 2nd for sulfur oxygen r2so appeared at 165 2 ev with intensity 6 66 the 3rd for carbon sulfur oxygen cs os cso bonds appear at 167 9 ev with high intensity 46 05 and the 4th for carbon sulfur bond cs o3 bond appear at 169 88 ev with intensity 8 5 the formation of sulfur bonds after mb adsorption prove the formation both the π π stacking interactions with hydrogen bonding which show a vital part in the adsorption of mb in graphitic carbon nitride gels 3 9 3 synergism between graphitic carbon nitride gel and mb based on the previous obtained results we detected that the adsorption mechanism of mb was chiefly an interaction or cooperation of two or more substances result in graphitic carbon nitride gels involving π π overlapping and hydrogen bonds inter intramolecular fig 12 in the literature scientists have establish that aryl types tend to form π π stacking interactions in an edge to face or face to face direction 66 owing to the π π stacking among the graphitic carbon nitride gel and mb mb is easily adsorbed onto the surface of the graphitic carbon nitride causing in an improved in intensity of cc cc peaks as stated early the o atom is a good hydrogen acceptor and the oxygen containing collections show a significant role in hydrogen bonding in the existence of the dentate a great quantity of carboxyl groups is present on the surface of the hydrogel these groups have two oxygen units namely a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group the hydroxyl group freely to form hydrogen bonds with the n and s ions in the mb molecule oh n o hn s nh s co and n co hydrogen bonding significantly encourages the adsorption of mb by the graphitic carbon nitride gel but effects on a reduction in the number of hydroxyl groups and carbonyl groups furthermore mb has a strong ability for protons related to its lone pair of electrons n also has a tendency to display a strong affinity for protons 67 when nh2 species were presented on the surface of mb they not only made hydrogen bonds nh n with the nh2 classes in mb molecules but they moreover produced hydrogen bonds nh o and n ho with the hydroxyl groups attached to fe fig 12 causing in enlarged level of n ho n connections fig 13b as stated in the literature 65 the existence of two terminal functional groups specifically the amino and carboxylic acid groups directed to the establishment of four types of single hydrogen bonds oh n oh o nh n nh o and two kinds of double hydrogen bonds 2 oh o and 2 nh o hence the presented nh2 moieties significantly developed both of the adsorption capacity and the adsorption rate through the obvious improvement of hydrogen bonding similar results have been reported for the adsorptions of dyes and p asa over nh2 mil 101 al 67 72 4 conclusion the grafting of natural polymer adsorbents with acrylic acid and embedding stacked two dimensional zno g c3n4 nanocomposite into the paa g hec pva polymer is an inspired strategy to endorse the removal basic dyes mb

enhanced by embedding zno g c3n4 nanocomposite the swelling and adsorption properties showed response to crosslinker zno g c3n4 contents and ph the mb adsorbed completely by zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 nanocomposite and reached 100 2 06 up to 50 min compared with paa g hec pva fe3 100 1 41 up to 75 min at dose 3 g l for 30 mg l mb at ph 9 the linear and nonlinear kinetics and adsorption models were applied the adsorption process followed nonlinear models and langmuir model is the more applicable than freundlich and temkin the chief adsorption mechanism includes synergism between π π stacking interactions and hydrogen bonding concerning nh2 in graphitic carbon nitride zno g c3n4 6 paa g hec pva fe3 and mb the introduced nh2 groups on graphitic carbon nitride did not affect π π stacking connections between aryl units but significantly enhanced both the adsorption capacity through obvious hydrogen bonding improvements moreover interparticle dispersion of mb molecules have a chief part in the preliminary phase of adsorption because it was dependable fine with experimental kinetic data the leading adsorption mechanism contains the interaction of co operative π π stacking

13493,adsorption is one of the most promising techniques for large scale application in phosphate containing wastewater treatment and the synthesis of efficient adsorbents is the core of the process high efficiency adsorbent include inorganic adsorbents and organic adsorbents and the chitosan performs better adsorption capacity because of readily biodegradable and abundant amino functional groups in this work a kind of calcium modified chitosan microspheres ca cts gel has been gained through in situ precipitation for absorbing phosphate from simulation wastewater the influence factors of the synthesis conditions including crosslinking agent addition mental ions types and ca2 loading amount etc on the adsorption efficiency have been researched the results showed that the metal ions modified chitosan represented by la3 modified chitosan was significantly different from ca2 modified chitosan in loading principle the characterization results indicated that the adsorption mechanism belonged to the precipitation conversion between ca oh 2 and cahpo4 2h2o the adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics results showed that the adsorption reaction was endothermic and spontaneous and the langmuir fitted maximum adsorption capacity was 23 7 mg g at 25 c the adsorption experiment results also showed that the other anions i e so4 2 and co3 2 have a negative influence on phosphate removal attributing to the smaller ksp values of their calcium salts in addition the dynamic phosphate adsorption curves have been obtained under different operating conditions for evaluating the industrial application prospect of the as prepared ca cts gel graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords phosphate adsorption ca cts gel precipitation conversion dynamic adsorption wastewater treatment 1 introduction phosphorus is an indispensable nutrient and essential element for biological organisms and also maintains the normal functioning of the aquatic ecosystem however excessive phosphate is released into rivers and lakes in the form of industrial discharge and agricultural wastewaters which causes serious eutrophication and algal bloom for aquatic environment 1 3 therefore to reduce the phosphate content in water and prevent eutrophication it is imperative to develop an economic and technical feasible method to control phosphate recently there are numerous methods to remove phosphate including ion exchange 4 5 chemical precipitation 6 biological degradation 7 and adsorption method 8 among them the adsorption process has received extensive attention in recent years owing to its simple operation less secondary sludge and low price and preparing an efficient and cheap adsorbents is the core of successful implementation of the adsorption process the common used adsorbents can be divided into two kinds i e inorganic materials and organic materials inorganic materials mainly include molecular sieve 9 metal oxide 10 hydrotalcite 11 and so on jianda zhang 12 used la iii coordinated mcm 41 to adsorb phosphate with a maximum adsorption capacity of 54 3 mg g rodrigues 13 investigate the adsorption of phosphate onto hydrated zirconia and nano zirconia metal particles and the maximum adsorption capacity was 53 mg g and 95 mg g respectively organic adsorbent materials include biochar 14 clay mineral 15 gel 16 and so on taiwan liao 17 studied la oh 3 modified magnetic pineapple biochar to remove phosphate k reitzel 18 researched the behavior of phosphate adsorption in fresh and brackish water by lanthanum modified bentonite xin liu 19 prepared zr modified crosslinked chitosan by precipitation method to adsorb phosphate and its maximum adsorption capacity reached 60 6 mg g from the aforementioned example mental ions modified adsorbent has been widely applied and la is prominent because of strong binding ability with phosphate however the cost of la is high and scarce so low cost adsorbents should be selected for industrial production of note there are many ca mg and al modified adsorbents for phosphate adsorption and also showed perfect adsorption capacities such as mg accumulated biochar fe3o4 chitosan and ca biochar nowadays a huge amount of composite materials and functional materials have been reported for phosphate removal they have good adsorption capacity and strong stability 20 22 but the preparation process was complex and the harsh operation conditions needed 23 25 therefore it was necessary to explore materials with simple operation as we all know chitosan as organic materials for its biodegradability in wastewater treatment has been widely used chitosan with a positive charge and easy biodegradation in crustacean shell is the second largest natural polymer after cellulose 26 it has great advantages in water treatment applications such as non toxic biodegradable and available attracting the researchers attention 27 28 chitosan with its amino and hydroxyl groups has been used to adsorb phosphate but it is necessary to modify due to low adsorption capacity and long equilibration time 29 the common loaded ions including metal ions zirconium iron copper zinc etc and rare earth metal ions lanthanum cerium have been used to modify chitosan in order to improve phosphate adsorption capacity 30 31 licheng lin 32 used chitosan lanthanum hydroxide composite aerogel beads to adsorb phosphate with a maximum adsorption capacity of 148 33 mg g xin liu 19 prepared hydrogel with zr loaded chitosan and the maximum phosphate adsorption capacity was 60 6 mg g therefore the coordination complex formed by metal and amino and hydroxyl groups of chitosan has a strong force on phosphate including electrostatic adsorption and ion exchange different from the metal mentioned above the complex formed calcium ion and chitosan immobilizes phosphate by precipitation on the surface of the adsorbent moreover calcium ion loaded chitosan reaches equilibrium within 10 min and the cost of this material is cheap in this work ca2 was selected as modified ions to prepare the ca chitosan complex and was used to adsorb phosphate in wastewater which have been paid little attention as before the physicochemical properties and phosphate adsorption mechanism of the material were analyzed the purpose of this study was to discuss the phosphate adsorption mechanism of different ions modified chitosan and the adsorption behavior of ca2 modified chitosan by different crosslinking agent content at the same time the economic effect and industrialization application of adsorbent were studied 2 materials and method 2 1 materials chitosan 85 deacetylated was purchased from shanghai titan technology co ltd china calcium chloride 50 glutaraldehyde sodium hydroxide and potassium dihydrogen phosphate were all provided by yunnan qiaosi co ltd china and the reagents were analytical pure in the process of experiment the water used for preparing solution and washing in the experiment was deionized di water 2 2 ca cts gel preparation ca cts was prepared by in situ precipitation and crosslinking methods briefly 1 g chitosan dissolved into 25 ml 2 acetic acid solution was agitated for 30 min at room temperature to obtain a homogenous solution then 1 71 g cacl2 2h2o was dissolved in 10 ml di water and then it was slowly added into chitosan acetic acid solution stirring until homogenous solution obtained 5 ml 5 glutaraldehyde was added to the homogenous chitosan solution containing ca2 and remained stationary for 30 min at room temperature until the homogeneous gel was gained lastly the gel was transferred to 1 mol l 200 ml naoh solution standing for 12 h and the gel was cut into equal volume with a knife washing to neutral and freeze drying for 24 h the obtained ca cts gel was stored in a desiccator for phosphate adsorption experiments 2 3 characterizations the surface and morphology of ca cts gel before and after adsorption were observed by a scanning electron microscope sem su8200 the subtle structure of ca cts gel before and after adsorption was carried out through the transmission electron microscope tem jem2100f the elemental proportion of adsorbent was performed simultaneously with tem using an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer eds in the same area the composition of the adsorbent was investigated by x ray diffraction xrd rigaku ultima iv in the range of 5 2θ 80 the functional groups of adsorbents before and after adsorption were studied through a fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir nicolet is10 at room temperature using kbr particles in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 the element chemical state and electron states of ca cts was carried out by an x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo fisher scientific k alpha the zero potential of adsorbent was observed through a zeta potential zs90 2 4 phosphate adsorption a large number of experimental tests were completed to explore optimal experiment condition of phosphate adsorption the initial concentration of phosphate c0 20 mg l was prepared with kh2po4 under the condition of natural ph 5 0 05 g ca cts gel was added into a 100 ml conical flask containing 50 ml phosphate solution shaking 12 h at 25 c and the content of absorbed p was measured by phosphomolybdate blue spectrophotometric and the adsorption capacity was calculated by the expression 1 the adsorption behavior of different mental ions loaded chitosan on phosphate was studied through adjusting the types of metal ions in the preparation process the influence of the crosslinking agent on phosphate adsorption was observed by changing the content of glutaraldehyde in the preparation process of ca cts gel the ph of the phosphate solution was adjusted by hcl or naoh to discuss the effect of ph on phosphate adsorption capacity the selectivity of adsorbent was investigated in the condition of kno3 khco3 k2so4 and kcl the maximum adsorption capacity was calculated by the langmuir or freundlich model at the concentration of phosphate from 5 mg l to 80 mg l kinetics and thermodynamics were also used to research the reaction process and enthalpy associated with adsorption respectively the potential of the industrial application of adsorbent was evaluated by studying breakthrough curves and breakthrough time 1 q e c 0 c e v m 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption performance of metal cts gels 3 1 1 effect of glutaraldehyde content to study the influence of crosslinking agents on the phosphate adsorption capacity different amounts of 5 glutaraldehyde were added to prepare adsorbents contained 0 28 v v 0 62 0 80 1 1 and 1 5 glutaraldehyde in the preparation process of ca cts gel adsorbent the influence of glutaraldehyde amount on phosphate adsorption capacity under different ph was shown in fig 1 the adsorption capacity was high at small glutaraldehyde content which was consistent with bao liu s study 33 the reason for this phenomenon was cross linking reaction between aldehyde groups in glutaraldehyde and amino groups in chitosan might affect adsorption sites and subsequently affect adsorption capacity ca2 could precipitate phosphate on the surface of chitosan in the case of less glutaraldehyde content on the contrary under the condition of high cross linking agent content ca2 will be covered by the complex by the cross linking effect of amino and aldehyde groups on the inner surface and lost the opportunity to combine with phosphate so the adsorption capacity will decrease in this work 0 62 glutaraldehyde was selected for phosphate adsorption because not only the adsorption capacity could be guaranteed but also the adsorbent could possess certain mechanical strength 3 1 2 effect of different metal ions the influence of different metal ions loaded chitosan on the phosphate adsorption capacity by the addition of the same content of mental ions 50 wt was shown in fig 2 a with the variation of the ph the trend of phosphate adsorption capacity of zr4 ce3 and la3 loaded chitosan were consistent with that of unmodified chitosan and the relationship of adsorption capacity was la3 ce3 zr4 raw chitosan on the contrary with the increase of ph the phosphate capacity of chitosan loaded ca2 increased gradually while chitosan loaded mg2 had almost no effect on phosphate the reasons for these phenomena were 34 1 the number of positive charge and the radiuses of metal ions 2 the binding ability of metal ions to chitosan firstly zr4 ce3 and la3 produced coordination compounds with metal ions and hydroxyl groups or amino of chitosan mechanism of coordination compounds formation was the reciprocity between the orbits of σ bond and the empty 5 s orbit of the atom la with the increase of radius of metal ions a stable high coordination complex can be formed with high phosphate adsorption capacity so the trend of adsorption capacity was la3 ce3 zr4 raw chitosan due to the strong coordination complexation the metal ions were firmly fixed in the network structure formed by chitosan and metal ions and no m oh x was formed on the surface under acidic conditions the coordination compounds adsorbed phosphate through electrostatic adsorption and coordination exchange while under alkaline conditions the phosphate adsorption capacity was poor owing to the electrostatic repulsion between oh and po4 3 19 35 moreover at different ph values the trend of adsorption capacity of chitosan loaded ca2 was opposite to that of zr4 ce3 and la3 because the coordination ability formed by ca2 and chitosan was relatively small in the preparation of ca cts gel ca oh 2 would be obtained on the surface of adsorbent by in situ precipitation so ca oh 2 could play an important role in the process of phosphate adsorbing finally the ionic radius of ca2 was larger than mg2 and ca2 were easier to form a coordination compound than mg2 even though the mg oh 2 formed on the surface of chitosan it is not easy to be further converted into magnesium phosphate precipitation due to the small ksp so the phosphate adsorption of chitosan loaded mg2 was larger than ca2 different from the mechanism of zr4 ce3 and la3 the ca cts gel for phosphate may be surface precipitation to produced capo4 2h2o or ca3 po4 2 there were many chitosan loaded zr4 ce3 and la3 in the previous studies so ca cts was selected as an adsorbent to study the adsorption behavior of phosphate in this work 3 1 3 effect of ca2 loading amount the effect of ca2 loaded chitosan on phosphate adsorption was shown in fig 2 b with the increase of ca2 loaded content the phosphate adsorption capacity increased obviously the loading amount of ca2 was one of the important factors affecting the phosphate adsorption capacity because ca2 as the adsorption site provided the site center for phosphate adsorption during the adsorption process the active sites were less on the condition of ca2 loading amount small and then the active sites were quickly filled with phosphate which reduced the phosphate attachment point when the ca2 loading amount increased the active sites increased so the phosphate adsorption capacity increased finally 36 the more ca oh 2 formed was favorable the phosphate adsorption on the surface of chitosan adsorbent therefore it is also confirmed that the effect of ca cts gel adsorbent on phosphate was mainly the combination of ca ions and phosphate in this work 50 ca2 loading was selected as the best loading amount for further adsorption 3 1 4 effect of ph ph was one of the important factors in the adsorption process and there were different forms of phosphate and the ability to combine with ca2 under different ph table 1 adsorbed p mainly existed in the form of h3po4 h2po4 hpo4 2 and po4 3 at ph pka1 pka1 ph pka2 pka2 ph pka3 and pka3 ph respectively therefore the weak bonding between ca and adsorbed p under acidic conditions ca3 po4 2 might be generated due to the strong bonding between ca and adsorbed p under alkaline conditions besides the zeta potential of ca cts gel was showed in fig 2 c the surface charge of ca cts was positive at ph 2 3 and negative at ph 2 3 so in theory the phosphate adsorption capacity may decrease because of electrostatic repulsion however the phosphate adsorption capacity increased with the increase of ph in fact and this phenomenon meant that electrostatic adsorption was not the mechanism of the reaction but precipitation in the former research the mechanism of chitosan loaded la for phosphate was electrostatic attraction and coordination exchange but the mechanism of ca cts gel was surface precipitation this phenomenon can also explain the difference in phosphate adsorption capacity between the trend of ca cts gel and other metal ions in fig 2 a the equilibrium ph after adsorption of phosphate shown in fig 2 d the final ph was greater than 7 except initial ph 1 so the precipitate was generated from phosphate solution eutrophication usually occurs in spring in china so the natural ph ph 6 and 25 c were selected as the condition of further adsorption experiments 24 37 38 3 1 5 adsorption isotherm adsorption isotherm plays an important role in adsorption performance 41 in this work two isotherms langmuir and freundlich isotherm have been used to fit at different temperatures and the fitting curve was shown in fig 3 the maximum adsorption capacity was investigated under the condition of phosphate concentration varied from 5 to 50 at natural ph at different temperature for 4 h the equilibrium adsorbing capacity of phosphate was calculated according to qe and the langmuir and freundlich expression were provided below the corresponding parameters also were given in table s1 the fitting performance of langmuir was greater than freundlich because of the r2 of langmuir higher than freundlich meanwhile the maximum adsorption capacity was 23 7 mg g at 25 c and increased with the rise of temperature which was higher than many adsorbents in previous studies table s2 therefore the adsorption process for phosphate was consistent with the chemisorption of a single molecular layer on the surface of ca cts the adsorbed p was immobilized through the strong bond and high selectivity and this process was irreversible 2 langmuir model q e k qce 1 k ce 3 freundlich model q e k f c e n where qe is phosphate adsorption capacity at equilibrium mg p g the value of v is the volume of solution ml ce and c0 is the phosphate concentrations at the equilibrium and initial time mg p l respectively and m represents the weight of adsorbent g q is the maximum sorption capacity on adsorbent mg g and kl is a constant of the affinity of the binding sites l mg kf is related to the sorption capacity of the adsorbent mg 1 n ln g and n indicates the sorption favorability usually langmuir expression is suitable for the chemisorption reaction of single molecular layer while freundlich expression is suitable physical adsorption of multilayer layer 3 1 6 adsorption kinetics to research the behavior of phosphate adsorption of ca cts several adsorption kinetics models were used for fitting 42 including the pseudo first order model eq 4 pseudo second order model eq 5 intra particle diffusion model eq 6 elovich eq 7 the fitting curves of adsorption kinetics and parameters were shown in fig 4 and table s3 respectively it can be observed that the adsorption capacity increased rapidly within 10 min and reached equilibrium at 20 min fig 4a and the correlation coefficient of pseudo first order kinetics r2 0 989 was the higher than the three remaining types of models so the adsorption process conformed to physical adsorption of note the intra particle diffusion model can be divided into two phases the diffusion rate of phosphate on the surface of ca cts and the diffusion rate of phosphate in the ca cts particle the correlation coefficient of the first phase was higher than the second phase so the limiting step of phosphate adsorption was internal diffusion by ca cts however this result was different from the result of isothermal fitting indicating that the process may be a physical and chemical process including the physical process of phosphate intramolecular diffusion and the chemical process of precipitation reaction 4 pseudo first order model ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 5 pseudo second order model t q t 1 k 2 q e c 2 t q e c 6 intra particle diffusion model q t k 3 t 0 5 c 7 elovich model q t a b int 3 1 7 adsorption thermodynamics thermodynamic parameters were provided to determine whether the adsorption reaction happened spontaneously 43 including gipps free energy variable g enthalpy change h entropy change s the fitting curve and the corresponding were shown in fig 5 and table s4 respectively usually the reaction was the endothermic process at h 0 and s 0 delegated the confusion degree of the system was increased and the reaction was a spontaneous process at g 0 with the increase of temperature the gibbs free energy was smaller which indicated that higher temperature was beneficial to the adsorption reaction therefore the phosphate adsorption on ca cts was a spontaneous feasible endothermic process by the thermodynamic parameters 8 k d q e c e 9 ln k d s r h rt 10 g h t s where δg is the adsorption standard gibbs free energy variable kj mol kd is the adsorption thermodynamic equilibrium constant δh0 is the adsorption standard enthalpy change kj mol δs0 is the adsorption standard entropy change value kj mol 1 k 1 3 1 8 selectivity of ca cts there are many anions including cl so4 2 co3 2 no3 may have a negative effect on phosphate adsorption because these anions competed with adsorbed p for adsorption sites the influence of coexisting anion on phosphate adsorption by ca cts shown in fig s1 it can be observed that cl and no3 had no effect on phosphate adsorption but so4 2 and co3 2 had a significant effect on phosphate adsorption with the increase of concentration from the above analysis ca3 po4 2 or capo4 2h2o may be formed on the surface of ca cts gel when so4 2 and co3 2 in solution simultaneously the caso4 and caco3 also would be formed however the ksp of caso4 and caco3 were 4 93 10 5 and 2 8 10 9 lower than the ksp of ca3 po4 2 so so4 2 and co3 2 had little effect on phosphate adsorption at low concentrations meanwhile the ksp of caco3 was lower than caso4 so the influence of co3 2 was more significant than so4 2 from the above impact factors of ph temperature and anion the material has a wide range of ph less affected by other anions and high selectivity the preparation process of the material was simple low cost and high value of economy so the material can be widely used in industrial production 44 3 2 characterizations of ca cts the physicochemical properties of ca cts before and after adsorption were investigated by scanning electron microscope sem transmission electron microscope tem x ray diffraction xrd fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps the composition of the adsorbents was analyzed by xrd in fig 6 a 2ɵ 19 9 was attributable to the characteristic peak of chitosan after the ca cts gel prepared the intensity of the characteristic peak became weak which indicated the surface of chitosan was coated with inorganic complex after ca doping and the crystallization performance of chitosan also decreased in addition there was a characteristic peak of caco3 and ca oh 2 in ca cts gel before adsorption which showed that ca oh 2 was generated during the preparation of ca cts gel and ca combined with co2 in the air to form caco3 the characteristic peak of ca oh 2 disappeared and a new characteristic peak of cahpo4 2h2o appeared after phosphate adsorption so the mechanism of phosphate adsorption was actually the conversion between precipitation besides the conversion between ca oh 2 and cahpo4 2h2o rather than caco3 and cahpo4 2h2o during the adsorbing reaction due to the ksp caco3 ksp cahpo4 2h2o ksp ca oh 2 and thus the characteristic peak of ca oh 2 disappeared but the characteristic peak of caco3 still existing after adsorption the xrd analysis after adsorption shows that there was no ca3 po4 2 which may be due to the absence of po4 3 under acidic condition or the harsh conversion condition of ca oh 2 or caco3 to ca3 po4 2 45 therefore xrd analysis showed that ca cts gel has a core shell structure gel formed by chitosan and glutaraldehyde inside and the surface covered with ca oh 2 and caco3 generated by ca2 with co3 2 produced by the dissolution of co2 in the air from the above analysis phosphate was immobilized by adsorbent through the mutual conversion of precipitation 46 the chemical bond of each component in the adsorbent was analyzed by ftir in fig 6 b the peak position of raw chitosan was consistent with cts gel and 3430 cm 1 was associated with stretching vibration of oh and nh2 groups the 2920 cm 1 and 1658 cm 1 bands were attributable to the asymmetric stretching vibration of ch group and nh2 groups respectively the 1424 cm 1 was attributable to the ch asymmetric bending vibration of ch group 47 1078 cm 1 and 598 cm 1 was associated with co stretch and oh out of plane bends respectively 8 48 compared with the raw chitosan and chitosan gel many characteristic bends of chitosan in ca cts gel before and after adsorption have disappeared which could illustrate the structure of chitosan has changed tremendously due to ca doped there was a reduction in the intensity of oh groups at 3430 cm 1 because the content of oh in ca cts gel decreased and maybe ca oh 2 generated there was an increase in the intensity of asymmetric bending vibration of ch at 1424 cm 1 because organic matter and minerals were superimposed by two degree degenerate symmetrical stretching vibrations accordingly this phenomenon further indicated the successful synthesis of ca cts gel the new characteristic peak of caco3 at 867 cm 1 and 706 cm 1 appeared in ca cts gel before adsorption while the opo bending and opo bending attributed to adsorbed phosphate appeared in 619 cm 1 and 540 cm 1 respectively 8 therefore the result of ftir analysis was consistent with xrd which observed phosphate adsorbed by ca cts gel was precipitation conversion method instead of the mechanism of la loaded chitosan including electrostatic adsorption and ligand exchange the surface morphology and internal structure of ca cts gel were observed by sem and tem showed in fig 7 from fig 7 a the surface morphology of ca cts gel was in the shape of three dimensional brain striation 36 and the structure of ca cts gel tightly connected together through the crosslinking of chitosan with glutaraldehyde in fig 7 b besides ca cts gel had no obvious pore structure and the adsorbed p would be immobilized on the surface of ca cts gel rather than in the hole of ca cts gel in fig 7 c the adsorbent formed a core shell structure with a surface surrounded by calcium hydroxide and calcium carbonate and the formation of cross linking inside the 101 110 202 crystallographic planes of caco3 was exposed in the process of in situ precipitation fig 7 d indicating the polycrystalline properties of the adsorbent surface 49 which was consistent with the result of xrd analysis the sem of ca cts gel after adsorption was shown in fig 7 e the flocculent substance deposited on the surface of the adsorbent like seaweed combined with the tem of ca cts gel after adsorption in fig 7 f the flocculent substance was in the form of crystal which may be cahpo4 2h2o the element comparison of adsorbent before and after the adsorption was shown in fig 7 l the atomic percentage of c decreased from 88 3 to 51 7 and the reason for this phenomenon may be chitosan precipitated under alkaline conditions or the surface was occupied by calcium carbonate the decrease of the atomic percentage of n may be due to the decrease of chitosan besides there are two reasons for the increase in the percentage of o and ca atoms 1 the introduction of phosphate with o will definitely increase the o atom content 2 the atomic percentage of ca increased because of the decline of the atomic percentage of c and n according to the principle of material conservation a new element p appeared after adsorption indicating that phosphate was successfully adsorbed by ca cts gel the functional group on the surface of ca cts gel was studied by xps in fig s2 the survey spectra of the ca cts gel before and after adsorption shown in fig s2 a around 130 0 ev 135 0 ev a new peak at the binging energy appeared which might be related to the p 2p orbital the p 2p spectra of ca cts gel after adsorption was shown in fig s2 b the p 2p3 2 at 133 3 ev and p 2p1 2 at 133 9 ev respectively in this binding energy the new substance cahpo4 2h2o might appear after adsorption this result indicated that phosphate was successfully fixed on the surface of ca cts gel 50 the o 1s spectra of ca cts gel shown in fig s2 c two individual peaks will fit at 532 4 ev and 531 3 ev which were attributed to the co mental carbonates m co3 respectively 51 this result showed that the ca cts gel retained the structure of chitosan and formed caco3 by in situ precipitation compared with the o 1s spectra of ca cts gel before adsorption the o 1 s spectra of ca cts gel after adsorption in fig s2 c can well fit at 532 4 ev and 531 2 ev which could be attributed to organic co and oxygen bonded to the metal m o respectively 52 the structure of chitosan after adsorption had not changed and new substances might be generated the ca 2p spectra of ca cts gel was shown in fig s2 d including a central peak centered at 346 7 ev ca 2p3 2 and a shakeup satellite peak at 350 5 ev ca 2p1 2 the ca 2p spectra of ca cts gel might be attributed to ca oh 2 so this result indicated the surface of chitosan was attached precipitation the ca 2p spectra of ca cts gel after adsorption shown in fig s2 d a central peak centered at 347 2 ev ca 2p3 2 might be related to cahpo4 2h2o therefore it can demonstrate that the precipitation conversation had appeared in the process of phosphate adsorption the possible adsorption mechanism was shown in fig 8 and the chemical reaction process was shown in formulas 11 18 chitosan made a protonation reaction in 2 hac solution and then chitosan will precipitate from the solution and co3 2 produced by the dissolution of co2 with oh to form caco3 under alkaline conditions at the same time ca oh 2 will generate through the ca2 reaction with oh meanwhile ca2 will react with co3 2 to form caco3 and ca oh 2 will be converted into caco3 under alkaline conditions through the characterization analysis of the three dimensional ca cts gel before and after adsorption the adsorbent consisted of two parts including the inner chitosan crosslinking and the outer metal complex the mechanism of phosphate adsorption was actually the conversion between ca oh 2 and cahpo4 2h2o owing to ksp cahpo4 2h2o ksp ca oh 2 according to formula 17 however the conversation between caco3 and ca3 po4 2 was not found because the condition of the conversation was rigorous therefore chitosan was only used as a place ca2 attaching while ca oh 2 played an adsorption site role in this adsorption reaction 11 cs n h 2 hac cs n h 3 a c 12 o h cs n h 3 cs n h 2 h 2 o 13 ca 2 2

dynamic adsorption to better explain the performance of the ca cts gel the dynamic adsorption experiment was performed based on the static adsorption experiment 53 in brief the adsorbent was filled in a packed column with a length of 20 cm and an inner diameter of 1 6 cm and deionized water was added to fully infiltrate it then flowed a specific concentration of phosphate solution into the adsorption column from top to bottom at a speed of 5 ml min and then the phosphate concentration was measured from the outlet section 19 t a c t c 0 0 1 20 t b c t c 0 0 9 21 q total qa 1000 q 1000 t 0 t t b c ad dt where ta is the breakthrough time tb is the depletion time qtotal is the adsorption capacity q is the inflow volume flow rate and a is the area of breakthrough curve the effect of phosphate concentration and adsorbent dosage on the breakthrough curve was shown in fig 9 with the increase of phosphate concentration the breakthrough point ct c0 0 1 moved to the left the breakthrough curve steeper and the time for the column to reach saturation ct c0 0 9 was dramatically shortened fig 9a after the phosphate concentration increased the active site of the adsorbent will be surrounded by more phosphate molecules and the mass transfer drive increased the number of phosphate molecules adsorbed by the adsorbent per unit time increased because the penetration point speed of the adsorption column was faster therefore the phosphate concentration had a great impact on the saturation rate and saturation time of the adsorption column however with the increase of adsorbent dosage the breakthrough point moved to the right the breakthrough curve smoother and the time for the column to reach saturation increased fig 9b after the adsorbent dose increased the active sites provided by the adsorbent increased so more phosphate molecules can be fixed on the surface of adsorbent in conclusion the increase of phosphate concentration or decrease of adsorption dose will put the breakthrough time and saturation time ahead and shorten the length of the mass transfer zone the concentration of phosphate in domestic wastewater was about 10 mg l so only 1 g of adsorbent was needed to ensure a good adsorption effect 54 the preparation process of ca cts gel is simple low cost and the adsorption capacity was better than most of the reported chitosan adsorption of phosphate ca oh 2 was attached to the surface of chitosan by in situ precipitation and phosphate was removed in the form of cahpo4 2h2o and ca5 po4 3oh in the dynamic adsorption process the simulated phosphate wastewater c0 10 mg l reaches the saturation point within 300 min which indicated that the material has a long saturation time and good persistence 5 conclusion in this work the ca doped chitosan gel was prepared by in situ precipitation for further studying phosphate adsorption different from other mental modified chitosan materials the phosphate adsorption mechanism of ca modified chitosan belonged to precipitation conversion between ca oh 2 and cahpo4 2h2o and ca5 po4 3oh the ca cts gel also presented a high adsorption rate which could achieve the sorption equilibrium of phosphate within only 10 min compared with other chitosan for phosphate removal ca cts gel performed better phosphate capacity and theoretical maximum phosphorus adsorption capacity of ca cts gel was 23 7 mg g by langmuir during phosphate adsorption ca based species provided adsorption sites for fixing phosphate on the surface of ca cts gel the kinetic and thermodynamics studies showed that the adsorption process was spontaneous monolayer and endothermic lastly the adsorption breakthrough experiment results indicated the as prepared ca cts gel adsorbent was suitable for using as an adsorbent to remove

13493,adsorption is one of the most promising techniques for large scale application in phosphate containing wastewater treatment and the synthesis of efficient adsorbents is the core of the process high efficiency adsorbent include inorganic adsorbents and organic adsorbents and the chitosan performs better adsorption capacity because of readily biodegradable and abundant amino functional groups in this work a kind of calcium modified chitosan microspheres ca cts gel has been gained through in situ precipitation for absorbing phosphate from simulation wastewater the influence factors of the synthesis conditions including crosslinking agent addition mental ions types and ca2 loading amount etc on the adsorption efficiency have been researched the results showed that the metal ions modified chitosan represented by la3 modified chitosan was significantly different from ca2 modified chitosan in loading principle the characterization results indicated that the adsorption mechanism belonged to the precipitation conversion between ca oh 2 and cahpo4 2h2o the adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics results showed that the adsorption reaction was endothermic and spontaneous and the langmuir fitted maximum adsorption capacity was 23 7 mg g at 25 c the adsorption experiment results also showed that the other anions i e so4 2 and co3 2 have a negative influence on phosphate removal attributing to the smaller ksp values of their calcium salts in addition the dynamic phosphate adsorption curves have been obtained under different operating conditions for evaluating the industrial application prospect of the as prepared ca cts gel graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords phosphate adsorption ca cts gel precipitation conversion dynamic adsorption wastewater treatment 1 introduction phosphorus is an indispensable nutrient and essential element for biological organisms and also maintains the normal functioning of the aquatic ecosystem however excessive phosphate is released into rivers and lakes in the form of industrial discharge and agricultural wastewaters which causes serious eutrophication and algal bloom for aquatic environment 1 3 therefore to reduce the phosphate content in water and prevent eutrophication it is imperative to develop an economic and technical feasible method to control phosphate recently there are numerous methods to remove phosphate including ion exchange 4 5 chemical precipitation 6 biological degradation 7 and adsorption method 8 among them the adsorption process has received extensive attention in recent years owing to its simple operation less secondary sludge and low price and preparing an efficient and cheap adsorbents is the core of successful implementation of the adsorption process the common used adsorbents can be divided into two kinds i e inorganic materials and organic materials inorganic materials mainly include molecular sieve 9 metal oxide 10 hydrotalcite 11 and so on jianda zhang 12 used la iii coordinated mcm 41 to adsorb phosphate with a maximum adsorption capacity of 54 3 mg g rodrigues 13 investigate the adsorption of phosphate onto hydrated zirconia and nano zirconia metal particles and the maximum adsorption capacity was 53 mg g and 95 mg g respectively organic adsorbent materials include biochar 14 clay mineral 15 gel 16 and so on taiwan liao 17 studied la oh 3 modified magnetic pineapple biochar to remove phosphate k reitzel 18 researched the behavior of phosphate adsorption in fresh and brackish water by lanthanum modified bentonite xin liu 19 prepared zr modified crosslinked chitosan by precipitation method to adsorb phosphate and its maximum adsorption capacity reached 60 6 mg g from the aforementioned example mental ions modified adsorbent has been widely applied and la is prominent because of strong binding ability with phosphate however the cost of la is high and scarce so low cost adsorbents should be selected for industrial production of note there are many ca mg and al modified adsorbents for phosphate adsorption and also showed perfect adsorption capacities such as mg accumulated biochar fe3o4 chitosan and ca biochar nowadays a huge amount of composite materials and functional materials have been reported for phosphate removal they have good adsorption capacity and strong stability 20 22 but the preparation process was complex and the harsh operation conditions needed 23 25 therefore it was necessary to explore materials with simple operation as we all know chitosan as organic materials for its biodegradability in wastewater treatment has been widely used chitosan with a positive charge and easy biodegradation in crustacean shell is the second largest natural polymer after cellulose 26 it has great advantages in water treatment applications such as non toxic biodegradable and available attracting the researchers attention 27 28 chitosan with its amino and hydroxyl groups has been used to adsorb phosphate but it is necessary to modify due to low adsorption capacity and long equilibration time 29 the common loaded ions including metal ions zirconium iron copper zinc etc and rare earth metal ions lanthanum cerium have been used to modify chitosan in order to improve phosphate adsorption capacity 30 31 licheng lin 32 used chitosan lanthanum hydroxide composite aerogel beads to adsorb phosphate with a maximum adsorption capacity of 148 33 mg g xin liu 19 prepared hydrogel with zr loaded chitosan and the maximum phosphate adsorption capacity was 60 6 mg g therefore the coordination complex formed by metal and amino and hydroxyl groups of chitosan has a strong force on phosphate including electrostatic adsorption and ion exchange different from the metal mentioned above the complex formed calcium ion and chitosan immobilizes phosphate by precipitation on the surface of the adsorbent moreover calcium ion loaded chitosan reaches equilibrium within 10 min and the cost of this material is cheap in this work ca2 was selected as modified ions to prepare the ca chitosan complex and was used to adsorb phosphate in wastewater which have been paid little attention as before the physicochemical properties and phosphate adsorption mechanism of the material were analyzed the purpose of this study was to discuss the phosphate adsorption mechanism of different ions modified chitosan and the adsorption behavior of ca2 modified chitosan by different crosslinking agent content at the same time the economic effect and industrialization application of adsorbent were studied 2 materials and method 2 1 materials chitosan 85 deacetylated was purchased from shanghai titan technology co ltd china calcium chloride 50 glutaraldehyde sodium hydroxide and potassium dihydrogen phosphate were all provided by yunnan qiaosi co ltd china and the reagents were analytical pure in the process of experiment the water used for preparing solution and washing in the experiment was deionized di water 2 2 ca cts gel preparation ca cts was prepared by in situ precipitation and crosslinking methods briefly 1 g chitosan dissolved into 25 ml 2 acetic acid solution was agitated for 30 min at room temperature to obtain a homogenous solution then 1 71 g cacl2 2h2o was dissolved in 10 ml di water and then it was slowly added into chitosan acetic acid solution stirring until homogenous solution obtained 5 ml 5 glutaraldehyde was added to the homogenous chitosan solution containing ca2 and remained stationary for 30 min at room temperature until the homogeneous gel was gained lastly the gel was transferred to 1 mol l 200 ml naoh solution standing for 12 h and the gel was cut into equal volume with a knife washing to neutral and freeze drying for 24 h the obtained ca cts gel was stored in a desiccator for phosphate adsorption experiments 2 3 characterizations the surface and morphology of ca cts gel before and after adsorption were observed by a scanning electron microscope sem su8200 the subtle structure of ca cts gel before and after adsorption was carried out through the transmission electron microscope tem jem2100f the elemental proportion of adsorbent was performed simultaneously with tem using an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer eds in the same area the composition of the adsorbent was investigated by x ray diffraction xrd rigaku ultima iv in the range of 5 2θ 80 the functional groups of adsorbents before and after adsorption were studied through a fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir nicolet is10 at room temperature using kbr particles in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 the element chemical state and electron states of ca cts was carried out by an x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo fisher scientific k alpha the zero potential of adsorbent was observed through a zeta potential zs90 2 4 phosphate adsorption a large number of experimental tests were completed to explore optimal experiment condition of phosphate adsorption the initial concentration of phosphate c0 20 mg l was prepared with kh2po4 under the condition of natural ph 5 0 05 g ca cts gel was added into a 100 ml conical flask containing 50 ml phosphate solution shaking 12 h at 25 c and the content of absorbed p was measured by phosphomolybdate blue spectrophotometric and the adsorption capacity was calculated by the expression 1 the adsorption behavior of different mental ions loaded chitosan on phosphate was studied through adjusting the types of metal ions in the preparation process the influence of the crosslinking agent on phosphate adsorption was observed by changing the content of glutaraldehyde in the preparation process of ca cts gel the ph of the phosphate solution was adjusted by hcl or naoh to discuss the effect of ph on phosphate adsorption capacity the selectivity of adsorbent was investigated in the condition of kno3 khco3 k2so4 and kcl the maximum adsorption capacity was calculated by the langmuir or freundlich model at the concentration of phosphate from 5 mg l to 80 mg l kinetics and thermodynamics were also used to research the reaction process and enthalpy associated with adsorption respectively the potential of the industrial application of adsorbent was evaluated by studying breakthrough curves and breakthrough time 1 q e c 0 c e v m 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption performance of metal cts gels 3 1 1 effect of glutaraldehyde content to study the influence of crosslinking agents on the phosphate adsorption capacity different amounts of 5 glutaraldehyde were added to prepare adsorbents contained 0 28 v v 0 62 0 80 1 1 and 1 5 glutaraldehyde in the preparation process of ca cts gel adsorbent the influence of glutaraldehyde amount on phosphate adsorption capacity under different ph was shown in fig 1 the adsorption capacity was high at small glutaraldehyde content which was consistent with bao liu s study 33 the reason for this phenomenon was cross linking reaction between aldehyde groups in glutaraldehyde and amino groups in chitosan might affect adsorption sites and subsequently affect adsorption capacity ca2 could precipitate phosphate on the surface of chitosan in the case of less glutaraldehyde content on the contrary under the condition of high cross linking agent content ca2 will be covered by the complex by the cross linking effect of amino and aldehyde groups on the inner surface and lost the opportunity to combine with phosphate so the adsorption capacity will decrease in this work 0 62 glutaraldehyde was selected for phosphate adsorption because not only the adsorption capacity could be guaranteed but also the adsorbent could possess certain mechanical strength 3 1 2 effect of different metal ions the influence of different metal ions loaded chitosan on the phosphate adsorption capacity by the addition of the same content of mental ions 50 wt was shown in fig 2 a with the variation of the ph the trend of phosphate adsorption capacity of zr4 ce3 and la3 loaded chitosan were consistent with that of unmodified chitosan and the relationship of adsorption capacity was la3 ce3 zr4 raw chitosan on the contrary with the increase of ph the phosphate capacity of chitosan loaded ca2 increased gradually while chitosan loaded mg2 had almost no effect on phosphate the reasons for these phenomena were 34 1 the number of positive charge and the radiuses of metal ions 2 the binding ability of metal ions to chitosan firstly zr4 ce3 and la3 produced coordination compounds with metal ions and hydroxyl groups or amino of chitosan mechanism of coordination compounds formation was the reciprocity between the orbits of σ bond and the empty 5 s orbit of the atom la with the increase of radius of metal ions a stable high coordination complex can be formed with high phosphate adsorption capacity so the trend of adsorption capacity was la3 ce3 zr4 raw chitosan due to the strong coordination complexation the metal ions were firmly fixed in the network structure formed by chitosan and metal ions and no m oh x was formed on the surface under acidic conditions the coordination compounds adsorbed phosphate through electrostatic adsorption and coordination exchange while under alkaline conditions the phosphate adsorption capacity was poor owing to the electrostatic repulsion between oh and po4 3 19 35 moreover at different ph values the trend of adsorption capacity of chitosan loaded ca2 was opposite to that of zr4 ce3 and la3 because the coordination ability formed by ca2 and chitosan was relatively small in the preparation of ca cts gel ca oh 2 would be obtained on the surface of adsorbent by in situ precipitation so ca oh 2 could play an important role in the process of phosphate adsorbing finally the ionic radius of ca2 was larger than mg2 and ca2 were easier to form a coordination compound than mg2 even though the mg oh 2 formed on the surface of chitosan it is not easy to be further converted into magnesium phosphate precipitation due to the small ksp so the phosphate adsorption of chitosan loaded mg2 was larger than ca2 different from the mechanism of zr4 ce3 and la3 the ca cts gel for phosphate may be surface precipitation to produced capo4 2h2o or ca3 po4 2 there were many chitosan loaded zr4 ce3 and la3 in the previous studies so ca cts was selected as an adsorbent to study the adsorption behavior of phosphate in this work 3 1 3 effect of ca2 loading amount the effect of ca2 loaded chitosan on phosphate adsorption was shown in fig 2 b with the increase of ca2 loaded content the phosphate adsorption capacity increased obviously the loading amount of ca2 was one of the important factors affecting the phosphate adsorption capacity because ca2 as the adsorption site provided the site center for phosphate adsorption during the adsorption process the active sites were less on the condition of ca2 loading amount small and then the active sites were quickly filled with phosphate which reduced the phosphate attachment point when the ca2 loading amount increased the active sites increased so the phosphate adsorption capacity increased finally 36 the more ca oh 2 formed was favorable the phosphate adsorption on the surface of chitosan adsorbent therefore it is also confirmed that the effect of ca cts gel adsorbent on phosphate was mainly the combination of ca ions and phosphate in this work 50 ca2 loading was selected as the best loading amount for further adsorption 3 1 4 effect of ph ph was one of the important factors in the adsorption process and there were different forms of phosphate and the ability to combine with ca2 under different ph table 1 adsorbed p mainly existed in the form of h3po4 h2po4 hpo4 2 and po4 3 at ph pka1 pka1 ph pka2 pka2 ph pka3 and pka3 ph respectively therefore the weak bonding between ca and adsorbed p under acidic conditions ca3 po4 2 might be generated due to the strong bonding between ca and adsorbed p under alkaline conditions besides the zeta potential of ca cts gel was showed in fig 2 c the surface charge of ca cts was positive at ph 2 3 and negative at ph 2 3 so in theory the phosphate adsorption capacity may decrease because of electrostatic repulsion however the phosphate adsorption capacity increased with the increase of ph in fact and this phenomenon meant that electrostatic adsorption was not the mechanism of the reaction but precipitation in the former research the mechanism of chitosan loaded la for phosphate was electrostatic attraction and coordination exchange but the mechanism of ca cts gel was surface precipitation this phenomenon can also explain the difference in phosphate adsorption capacity between the trend of ca cts gel and other metal ions in fig 2 a the equilibrium ph after adsorption of phosphate shown in fig 2 d the final ph was greater than 7 except initial ph 1 so the precipitate was generated from phosphate solution eutrophication usually occurs in spring in china so the natural ph ph 6 and 25 c were selected as the condition of further adsorption experiments 24 37 38 3 1 5 adsorption isotherm adsorption isotherm plays an important role in adsorption performance 41 in this work two isotherms langmuir and freundlich isotherm have been used to fit at different temperatures and the fitting curve was shown in fig 3 the maximum adsorption capacity was investigated under the condition of phosphate concentration varied from 5 to 50 at natural ph at different temperature for 4 h the equilibrium adsorbing capacity of phosphate was calculated according to qe and the langmuir and freundlich expression were provided below the corresponding parameters also were given in table s1 the fitting performance of langmuir was greater than freundlich because of the r2 of langmuir higher than freundlich meanwhile the maximum adsorption capacity was 23 7 mg g at 25 c and increased with the rise of temperature which was higher than many adsorbents in previous studies table s2 therefore the adsorption process for phosphate was consistent with the chemisorption of a single molecular layer on the surface of ca cts the adsorbed p was immobilized through the strong bond and high selectivity and this process was irreversible 2 langmuir model q e k qce 1 k ce 3 freundlich model q e k f c e n where qe is phosphate adsorption capacity at equilibrium mg p g the value of v is the volume of solution ml ce and c0 is the phosphate concentrations at the equilibrium and initial time mg p l respectively and m represents the weight of adsorbent g q is the maximum sorption capacity on adsorbent mg g and kl is a constant of the affinity of the binding sites l mg kf is related to the sorption capacity of the adsorbent mg 1 n ln g and n indicates the sorption favorability usually langmuir expression is suitable for the chemisorption reaction of single molecular layer while freundlich expression is suitable physical adsorption of multilayer layer 3 1 6 adsorption kinetics to research the behavior of phosphate adsorption of ca cts several adsorption kinetics models were used for fitting 42 including the pseudo first order model eq 4 pseudo second order model eq 5 intra particle diffusion model eq 6 elovich eq 7 the fitting curves of adsorption kinetics and parameters were shown in fig 4 and table s3 respectively it can be observed that the adsorption capacity increased rapidly within 10 min and reached equilibrium at 20 min fig 4a and the correlation coefficient of pseudo first order kinetics r2 0 989 was the higher than the three remaining types of models so the adsorption process conformed to physical adsorption of note the intra particle diffusion model can be divided into two phases the diffusion rate of phosphate on the surface of ca cts and the diffusion rate of phosphate in the ca cts particle the correlation coefficient of the first phase was higher than the second phase so the limiting step of phosphate adsorption was internal diffusion by ca cts however this result was different from the result of isothermal fitting indicating that the process may be a physical and chemical process including the physical process of phosphate intramolecular diffusion and the chemical process of precipitation reaction 4 pseudo first order model ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 5 pseudo second order model t q t 1 k 2 q e c 2 t q e c 6 intra particle diffusion model q t k 3 t 0 5 c 7 elovich model q t a b int 3 1 7 adsorption thermodynamics thermodynamic parameters were provided to determine whether the adsorption reaction happened spontaneously 43 including gipps free energy variable g enthalpy change h entropy change s the fitting curve and the corresponding were shown in fig 5 and table s4 respectively usually the reaction was the endothermic process at h 0 and s 0 delegated the confusion degree of the system was increased and the reaction was a spontaneous process at g 0 with the increase of temperature the gibbs free energy was smaller which indicated that higher temperature was beneficial to the adsorption reaction therefore the phosphate adsorption on ca cts was a spontaneous feasible endothermic process by the thermodynamic parameters 8 k d q e c e 9 ln k d s r h rt 10 g h t s where δg is the adsorption standard gibbs free energy variable kj mol kd is the adsorption thermodynamic equilibrium constant δh0 is the adsorption standard enthalpy change kj mol δs0 is the adsorption standard entropy change value kj mol 1 k 1 3 1 8 selectivity of ca cts there are many anions including cl so4 2 co3 2 no3 may have a negative effect on phosphate adsorption because these anions competed with adsorbed p for adsorption sites the influence of coexisting anion on phosphate adsorption by ca cts shown in fig s1 it can be observed that cl and no3 had no effect on phosphate adsorption but so4 2 and co3 2 had a significant effect on phosphate adsorption with the increase of concentration from the above analysis ca3 po4 2 or capo4 2h2o may be formed on the surface of ca cts gel when so4 2 and co3 2 in solution simultaneously the caso4 and caco3 also would be formed however the ksp of caso4 and caco3 were 4 93 10 5 and 2 8 10 9 lower than the ksp of ca3 po4 2 so so4 2 and co3 2 had little effect on phosphate adsorption at low concentrations meanwhile the ksp of caco3 was lower than caso4 so the influence of co3 2 was more significant than so4 2 from the above impact factors of ph temperature and anion the material has a wide range of ph less affected by other anions and high selectivity the preparation process of the material was simple low cost and high value of economy so the material can be widely used in industrial production 44 3 2 characterizations of ca cts the physicochemical properties of ca cts before and after adsorption were investigated by scanning electron microscope sem transmission electron microscope tem x ray diffraction xrd fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps the composition of the adsorbents was analyzed by xrd in fig 6 a 2ɵ 19 9 was attributable to the characteristic peak of chitosan after the ca cts gel prepared the intensity of the characteristic peak became weak which indicated the surface of chitosan was coated with inorganic complex after ca doping and the crystallization performance of chitosan also decreased in addition there was a characteristic peak of caco3 and ca oh 2 in ca cts gel before adsorption which showed that ca oh 2 was generated during the preparation of ca cts gel and ca combined with co2 in the air to form caco3 the characteristic peak of ca oh 2 disappeared and a new characteristic peak of cahpo4 2h2o appeared after phosphate adsorption so the mechanism of phosphate adsorption was actually the conversion between precipitation besides the conversion between ca oh 2 and cahpo4 2h2o rather than caco3 and cahpo4 2h2o during the adsorbing reaction due to the ksp caco3 ksp cahpo4 2h2o ksp ca oh 2 and thus the characteristic peak of ca oh 2 disappeared but the characteristic peak of caco3 still existing after adsorption the xrd analysis after adsorption shows that there was no ca3 po4 2 which may be due to the absence of po4 3 under acidic condition or the harsh conversion condition of ca oh 2 or caco3 to ca3 po4 2 45 therefore xrd analysis showed that ca cts gel has a core shell structure gel formed by chitosan and glutaraldehyde inside and the surface covered with ca oh 2 and caco3 generated by ca2 with co3 2 produced by the dissolution of co2 in the air from the above analysis phosphate was immobilized by adsorbent through the mutual conversion of precipitation 46 the chemical bond of each component in the adsorbent was analyzed by ftir in fig 6 b the peak position of raw chitosan was consistent with cts gel and 3430 cm 1 was associated with stretching vibration of oh and nh2 groups the 2920 cm 1 and 1658 cm 1 bands were attributable to the asymmetric stretching vibration of ch group and nh2 groups respectively the 1424 cm 1 was attributable to the ch asymmetric bending vibration of ch group 47 1078 cm 1 and 598 cm 1 was associated with co stretch and oh out of plane bends respectively 8 48 compared with the raw chitosan and chitosan gel many characteristic bends of chitosan in ca cts gel before and after adsorption have disappeared which could illustrate the structure of chitosan has changed tremendously due to ca doped there was a reduction in the intensity of oh groups at 3430 cm 1 because the content of oh in ca cts gel decreased and maybe ca oh 2 generated there was an increase in the intensity of asymmetric bending vibration of ch at 1424 cm 1 because organic matter and minerals were superimposed by two degree degenerate symmetrical stretching vibrations accordingly this phenomenon further indicated the successful synthesis of ca cts gel the new characteristic peak of caco3 at 867 cm 1 and 706 cm 1 appeared in ca cts gel before adsorption while the opo bending and opo bending attributed to adsorbed phosphate appeared in 619 cm 1 and 540 cm 1 respectively 8 therefore the result of ftir analysis was consistent with xrd which observed phosphate adsorbed by ca cts gel was precipitation conversion method instead of the mechanism of la loaded chitosan including electrostatic adsorption and ligand exchange the surface morphology and internal structure of ca cts gel were observed by sem and tem showed in fig 7 from fig 7 a the surface morphology of ca cts gel was in the shape of three dimensional brain striation 36 and the structure of ca cts gel tightly connected together through the crosslinking of chitosan with glutaraldehyde in fig 7 b besides ca cts gel had no obvious pore structure and the adsorbed p would be immobilized on the surface of ca cts gel rather than in the hole of ca cts gel in fig 7 c the adsorbent formed a core shell structure with a surface surrounded by calcium hydroxide and calcium carbonate and the formation of cross linking inside the 101 110 202 crystallographic planes of caco3 was exposed in the process of in situ precipitation fig 7 d indicating the polycrystalline properties of the adsorbent surface 49 which was consistent with the result of xrd analysis the sem of ca cts gel after adsorption was shown in fig 7 e the flocculent substance deposited on the surface of the adsorbent like seaweed combined with the tem of ca cts gel after adsorption in fig 7 f the flocculent substance was in the form of crystal which may be cahpo4 2h2o the element comparison of adsorbent before and after the adsorption was shown in fig 7 l the atomic percentage of c decreased from 88 3 to 51 7 and the reason for this phenomenon may be chitosan precipitated under alkaline conditions or the surface was occupied by calcium carbonate the decrease of the atomic percentage of n may be due to the decrease of chitosan besides there are two reasons for the increase in the percentage of o and ca atoms 1 the introduction of phosphate with o will definitely increase the o atom content 2 the atomic percentage of ca increased because of the decline of the atomic percentage of c and n according to the principle of material conservation a new element p appeared after adsorption indicating that phosphate was successfully adsorbed by ca cts gel the functional group on the surface of ca cts gel was studied by xps in fig s2 the survey spectra of the ca cts gel before and after adsorption shown in fig s2 a around 130 0 ev 135 0 ev a new peak at the binging energy appeared which might be related to the p 2p orbital the p 2p spectra of ca cts gel after adsorption was shown in fig s2 b the p 2p3 2 at 133 3 ev and p 2p1 2 at 133 9 ev respectively in this binding energy the new substance cahpo4 2h2o might appear after adsorption this result indicated that phosphate was successfully fixed on the surface of ca cts gel 50 the o 1s spectra of ca cts gel shown in fig s2 c two individual peaks will fit at 532 4 ev and 531 3 ev which were attributed to the co mental carbonates m co3 respectively 51 this result showed that the ca cts gel retained the structure of chitosan and formed caco3 by in situ precipitation compared with the o 1s spectra of ca cts gel before adsorption the o 1 s spectra of ca cts gel after adsorption in fig s2 c can well fit at 532 4 ev and 531 2 ev which could be attributed to organic co and oxygen bonded to the metal m o respectively 52 the structure of chitosan after adsorption had not changed and new substances might be generated the ca 2p spectra of ca cts gel was shown in fig s2 d including a central peak centered at 346 7 ev ca 2p3 2 and a shakeup satellite peak at 350 5 ev ca 2p1 2 the ca 2p spectra of ca cts gel might be attributed to ca oh 2 so this result indicated the surface of chitosan was attached precipitation the ca 2p spectra of ca cts gel after adsorption shown in fig s2 d a central peak centered at 347 2 ev ca 2p3 2 might be related to cahpo4 2h2o therefore it can demonstrate that the precipitation conversation had appeared in the process of phosphate adsorption the possible adsorption mechanism was shown in fig 8 and the chemical reaction process was shown in formulas 11 18 chitosan made a protonation reaction in 2 hac solution and then chitosan will precipitate from the solution and co3 2 produced by the dissolution of co2 with oh to form caco3 under alkaline conditions at the same time ca oh 2 will generate through the ca2 reaction with oh meanwhile ca2 will react with co3 2 to form caco3 and ca oh 2 will be converted into caco3 under alkaline conditions through the characterization analysis of the three dimensional ca cts gel before and after adsorption the adsorbent consisted of two parts including the inner chitosan crosslinking and the outer metal complex the mechanism of phosphate adsorption was actually the conversion between ca oh 2 and cahpo4 2h2o owing to ksp cahpo4 2h2o ksp ca oh 2 according to formula 17 however the conversation between caco3 and ca3 po4 2 was not found because the condition of the conversation was rigorous therefore chitosan was only used as a place ca2 attaching while ca oh 2 played an adsorption site role in this adsorption reaction 11 cs n h 2 hac cs n h 3 a c 12 o h cs n h 3 cs n h 2 h 2 o 13 ca 2 2

dynamic adsorption to better explain the performance of the ca cts gel the dynamic adsorption experiment was performed based on the static adsorption experiment 53 in brief the adsorbent was filled in a packed column with a length of 20 cm and an inner diameter of 1 6 cm and deionized water was added to fully infiltrate it then flowed a specific concentration of phosphate solution into the adsorption column from top to bottom at a speed of 5 ml min and then the phosphate concentration was measured from the outlet section 19 t a c t c 0 0 1 20 t b c t c 0 0 9 21 q total qa 1000 q 1000 t 0 t t b c ad dt where ta is the breakthrough time tb is the depletion time qtotal is the adsorption capacity q is the inflow volume flow rate and a is the area of breakthrough curve the effect of phosphate concentration and adsorbent dosage on the breakthrough curve was shown in fig 9 with the increase of phosphate concentration the breakthrough point ct c0 0 1 moved to the left the breakthrough curve steeper and the time for the column to reach saturation ct c0 0 9 was dramatically shortened fig 9a after the phosphate concentration increased the active site of the adsorbent will be surrounded by more phosphate molecules and the mass transfer drive increased the number of phosphate molecules adsorbed by the adsorbent per unit time increased because the penetration point speed of the adsorption column was faster therefore the phosphate concentration had a great impact on the saturation rate and saturation time of the adsorption column however with the increase of adsorbent dosage the breakthrough point moved to the right the breakthrough curve smoother and the time for the column to reach saturation increased fig 9b after the adsorbent dose increased the active sites provided by the adsorbent increased so more phosphate molecules can be fixed on the surface of adsorbent in conclusion the increase of phosphate concentration or decrease of adsorption dose will put the breakthrough time and saturation time ahead and shorten the length of the mass transfer zone the concentration of phosphate in domestic wastewater was about 10 mg l so only 1 g of adsorbent was needed to ensure a good adsorption effect 54 the preparation process of ca cts gel is simple low cost and the adsorption capacity was better than most of the reported chitosan adsorption of phosphate ca oh 2 was attached to the surface of chitosan by in situ precipitation and phosphate was removed in the form of cahpo4 2h2o and ca5 po4 3oh in the dynamic adsorption process the simulated phosphate wastewater c0 10 mg l reaches the saturation point within 300 min which indicated that the material has a long saturation time and good persistence 5 conclusion in this work the ca doped chitosan gel was prepared by in situ precipitation for further studying phosphate adsorption different from other mental modified chitosan materials the phosphate adsorption mechanism of ca modified chitosan belonged to precipitation conversion between ca oh 2 and cahpo4 2h2o and ca5 po4 3oh the ca cts gel also presented a high adsorption rate which could achieve the sorption equilibrium of phosphate within only 10 min compared with other chitosan for phosphate removal ca cts gel performed better phosphate capacity and theoretical maximum phosphorus adsorption capacity of ca cts gel was 23 7 mg g by langmuir during phosphate adsorption ca based species provided adsorption sites for fixing phosphate on the surface of ca cts gel the kinetic and thermodynamics studies showed that the adsorption

13494,the use of natural materials for wastewater treatment is a rapidly evolving issue natural materials are often low cost or waste materials and they are readily available in the case of industrial wastewater treatment the use of natural sorbents for the removal of heavy metals has shown positive results for many of the materials tested however there are ample reports in the literature of successes based solely on prepared solutions and laboratory trials which may not actually be as effective when applied under industrial conditions in the present work the possibility of using polish peat from 5 health resorts połczyn zdrój goczałkowice zdrój wieniec zdrój kamień pomorski and kołobrzeg as a sorbent for heavy metals in industrial wastewater from the steel electropolishing process is investigated the materials were characterized and then sorption tests using both laboratory and industrial wastewater solutions were performed the peat used turned out to be an effective material for both model laboratory and industrial wastewater characterized by high initial concentrations of metals such as iron chromium nickel and copper removal rate for initial concentration of 1000 mg dm3 was 99 for chromium and iron and 66 for nickel and cooper the total removal capacity was 30 7 mg g and indicated the following order fe iii cr iii cu ii ni ii in the wide range of industrial electrolyte for stainless steel electropolishing the method of conducting the research and characteristics of the materials open up new opportunities for removing heavy metal ions in an acidic environment without prior ph correction graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biosorption non conventional adsorbents wastewater nickel ftir 1 introduction pollution of the natural environment with toxic compounds through the increasing use of heavy metals in different industrial applications has become a key issue in natural ecosystems heavy metals are characterized by high mobility relatively high chemical stability and carcinogenicity since they are not degradable they accumulate in the environment making them one of the most dangerous contaminants in such systems and generating a risk to human health even a slight excess in the body s permissible concentration can cause numerous disorders and diseases which in turn may lead to death 1 3 from the viewpoint of infrastructure development and new technologies nickel is an important element due to its wide use in the production of stainless steel and alloys as well as in the plating industry and the production of batteries it is very important to meet the standards required by law for discharged nickel containing wastewater removal of nickel from industrial wastewater often poses a challenge especially in the case of wastewater from the steel electropolishing process due to the formation of complexes that hinder the removal process various methods are being used to remove metals from steel processing wastewater such as filtration ion exchange reverse osmosis electro deposition with the most common being those based on chemical precipitation 4 5 each of these methods has varying degrees of effectiveness and advantages as well as limitations out of concern for the natural environment the search for new eco friendly technologies that can be an alternative to traditionally used methods has in recent years become a trend the use of various types of materials of natural origin such as clay materials zeolites or biomass has been described in the literature 5 7 researchers have also tried to improve the effectiveness of these materials by modifying them 8 10 another direction is researching the possibility of using waste natural materials which in most cases are produced in significant quantities and are readily available at a very low cost spent tea leaves coffee waste fruits peels or nuts shells can be used to remove heavy metal ions 11 13 their disposal through re use may not only contribute to reducing the amount of waste but may also play an important role in the economy 6 14 however in many cases the studies conducted do not provide a clear answer to the question of whether these solutions may be used under industrial conditions for the removal of metals e g zinc chromium nickel copper from an industrial wastewater flow gogoi et al 7 used hydrochloric acid treated peat and citric acid treated sawdust the applied hcl treated peat and citric acid treated sawdust were more effective in removing nickel chromium and zinc from industrial wastewater than the commercially available mineral sorbent the use of bamboo activated carbon for nickel removal from electroplating industry wastewater made it possible to obtain a maximum of 98 7 efficiency in the case of using the most optimal values for all tested process parameters such as adsorbent dosage agitation speed particle size concentration contact time and ph level in their work sivaprakash et al 15 used fresh water algae zygnema sp as a low cost adsorbent for the removal of nickel from electroplating wastewater biosorbent was found to be efficient as 76 4 removal was observed at optimal conditions of ph contact time and dosage 16 the possible use of peat as a natural adsorbent has been noticed by several researchers peat has been used to remove various pollutants in many different types of effluent that include the atmosphere and groundwater 17 landfill leachates 18 septic tank effluent 19 mine drainage water 20 21 food processing wastewater 22 and oil spills 23 removal capabilities have been studied in terms of among other things odors 24 pesticides 25 n p and suspended solids 26 bod and ammonia 18 for the use of peat as a filtration material it s effectiveness is often assessed in terms of its use as one or the only layer in filter bed systems peat column peat bed reactor filter plant such solutions can only be used in small scale systems with a low hydraulic loading rate 27 28 and may not be suitable for large volumes of wastewater disposal several studies have established the potential of peat to capture dissolved metals 29 31 these found that peat is a valuable adsorbent and due to its polar character the adsorption potential for dissolved metals is quite high the metal removal efficiency of peat is highly dependent on ph cameron 32 found that better removals of metals fe mn zn k na ca mg and pb were achieved at a ph of 8 4 than 4 8 leiviskä et al 30 have conducted research at ph 5 6 while ho et al 28 have shown that the optimum range of ph for batching the adsorption of ni ii onto the sphagnum moss peat was 4 0 7 0 this ph range is also considered optimal by bartczak et al 29 and liu et al 33 similarly gardea torresdey et al 34 found that sphagnum peat moss could intake cu ii at a ph of 4 0 the peak adsorption for zn ii onto peat has been found to occur at a ph of over 5 5 for cd ii at a ph of over 5 0 and for ni ii the range was 4 0 7 0 with an optimum at 7 35 gosset et al 32 observed that as the ph decreased the metal removal efficiency decreased below ph 3 5 the removal of most metal ions from solution ceases with cr iv being an exception the results of the studies presented in the literature show that the optimum ph varies depending on the metal to be removed however most of the research have been conducted on effluents whose ph is within the above mentioned range i e in the optimal range ph 4 7 for as shown by the results of previous studies below ph 3 0 the peat chelating capacity decreases and at ph 9 0 the peat s structure degrades however with industrial wastewater there are some industries that generate acidic wastewater such wastewater includes those from the electropolishing process of chromium nickel steels which are the focus of analyses in this article reports of the use of peat for metal removal in acidic environments are negligible one of the most frequently mentioned limitations of these systems is the rapidly progressing clogging process which reduces their efficiency within a relatively short period after installation in recent years there has been a trend towards centralizing wastewater management aiming to close down small wastewater treatment plants thereby ensuring better supervision and a higher degree of wastewater treatment increased quality requirements also apply to the discharged industrial wastewater for these reasons it is important to use technology whereby the quality standards for all determined parameters are met it is even more interesting to ascertain whether peat which has been appreciated by many researchers due to its effectiveness in so many types of effluents will be able to remove metals from aggressive wastewater with low ph values the aim of this study is to assess the use of peat from five health resorts in poland to remove heavy metal ions the research assessed the effectiveness of metal removal nickel iron chromium and copper from industrial wastewater issuing from the electropolishing process of chromium nickel steels after the initial drying and grinding the organic material was used for sorption tests using both the model solution and industrial wastewater for the most promising of the analyzed material the sorption capacity removal percentage and kinetics model was determined the sorption process was carried out in wide range of initial heavy metals concentrations and an acidic environment which is a non standard approach for this type of process but which is carried out in most cases in an alkaline or neutral environment the selection of an acidic environment for the research stemmed from the need to reflect as much as possible the actual nature of the industrial wastewater under investigation 2 experimental procedures 2 1 materials the research used materials from various health resorts in poland połczyn zdrój pz goczałkowice zdrój gz wieniec zdrój wz kamień pomorski kp and kołobrzeg for which two materials with commercial names therapeutic peat kl and peat extra ke were analyzed the materials were dried at 105 c for 24 h and then ground to a powder to obtain particles size uniformity 2 2 chemicals analitical grade nickel iii nitrate ni no3 2 x 6h2o was used to prepare a model solution containing a specific concentration of nickel the industrial wastewater solution from a steel processing plant located in wrocław contained concentrated phosphoric acid v and sulphuric acid vi with the addition of triethanolamine industrial stock solution was used for industrial purposes for a long period of time so its initial level of contamination was rather high ion concentration fe cr ni cu 42 2 12 5 0 8 1 3 g kg 2 3 adsorption experiments to perform sorption tests with the model

filtrate was additionally filtered with a ptfe syringe filter 0 45 μm the removal percentage of metal ions and adsorption capacity were calculated according to eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 r c 0 c e c 0 100 2 q c 0 c e v w where c0 ce are initial and final concentrations of metal ions in the solution v is the solution volume and w is mass of dry adsorbent 2 4 instrumental analyses the characteristics of peat used in the research began with the determination of the percentage of organic and mineral substances as well as the moisture content for this purpose the material samples were weighed evaporated at 100 c then burned in an oven at 550 c and reweighed one of the sedimentation methods was used to determine the granulometric distribution of peat i e casagrande s areometric method in modification by prószyński this method is based on measuring the falling velocity of various size soil particles in still water the measurement is performed using a hydrometer and lasts for about 24 h the depth of the hydrometer immersion in the suspension depends on the density of suspension which changes with time as successive fractions of particles with smaller diameters fall to the bottom of the vessel with the tested suspension a detailed description of the procedure for measuring with this method can be found in the literature 36 for the determined particle size curves the non uniformity index cu and the grain curvature index cc were calculated using eqs 3 and 4 3 c u d 60 d 10 4 c c d 30 2 d 60 d 10 where d 10 d 30 d 60 are particle diameters which together with the smaller ones account for 10 30 and 60 of the sample mass peat respectively sem images were taken to visualize the materials used in the study the morphology of materials was examined by tescan vega ii sbh an electron scanning microscope in order to analyze the elemental composition the samples were tested for carbon hydrogen and nitrogen content using the ea 1110 chns elemental composition analyzer by ce instruments and icp oes inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy tests using the thermo scientific icap 7000 series icp oes apparatus with an automated sample feeder and software manufactured by qtegra intelligent scientific data solution the infrared absorption spectroscopy technique was used to measure the peat structure measurements were made on a thermo scientific nicolet iz10 ft ir fourier transformation infrared spectrometer with the module of thermo scientific nicolet in10 mx microscope equipped with a smart itx accessory and a diamond plate in the area of the electromagnetic spectrum with wavelength reciprocal of wavelength ranging from 4000 to 400 cm 1 i e primary infrared area this range is most applicable to the structure of organic compounds the device made it possible to measure the attenuated total reflectance atr technique ftir atr spectroscopy is a technique that requires minimum sample preparation apart from drying them making it possible to analyze a large number of samples within a short time in addition to being highly cost effective it is one such method that gives information on the broad chemical groups present depending on the available absorption peaks 37 to obtain ftir spectra 32 scans were collected at the 4 cm 1 spectral resolution 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of peat before carrying out tests to check the peat s effectiveness in removing heavy metals from industrial wastewater the material was subjected to detailed tests to ascertain their properties the analysis of the percentage of organic and mineral substances presented in fig 1 showed a significant similarity between all the tested materials both for raw samples in the natural state brought by the company and dried samples all raw materials were characterized by their high water content ranging from 73 to 92 the highest content of organic substances in dry matter was observed for the wz and kl peat at 87 and 86 respectively the lowest amount of organic substances was found in peat pz at 68 and gz at 73 then the granulometric composition of the materials was tested after drying and grinding and presented in fig 2 in most peat types kl ke gz kp particles in the range 0 006 1 mm were identified fig 2 only in the wz and pz samples were there also smaller particles 0 002 mm although as in the other samples the largest did not exceed 1 mm 60 of all grains in the peat were material with a granulation in the range of 0 25 0 6 mm the high values of the index cu 15 which were observed in the peat bogs of gz kl kp and ke prove the material s enormous diversity a slightly less variety of grains is characteristic of peat wz cu 8 8 while in peat pz unlike the others the material was uniformly grained cu index 5 all of the tested materials were multi fractionated cc 1 3 while small fractions filled the empty spaces between the larger grains the results of the particle size distribution correspond to the sem results presented in fig 3 it can be seen in the images that the largest particles of the material after drying and grinding are less than 1 mm in size it is noted that there are significantly more particles with sizes in the range of 0 1 1 mm smaller particles are also present but in a much smaller amount the results of elemental composition carbon hydrogen nitrogen and icp oes presented in tables 1 and 2 respectively le indicate a great similarity among all analyzed materials the c h n ratio for the best performing material is 83 12 5 and for the worst material 87 10 3 respectively the sulfur content ranged from 2856 to 12 292 mg kg the samples had a high iron content for kl gz and ke materials it exceeded 10 000 mg kg while wi was characterized by a much lower iron content at below 2000 mg kg for the remaining materials the obtained results were within the limits 5500 6000 mg kg in all materials tested no nickel was detected and low levels of copper at up to about 10 mg kg were also detected in the case of chromium the amounts were also quite low ranging from 10 to 30 m kg except for the pz material which was over 120 mg kg the analysis of the ft ir absorption spectra shown in fig 4 made it possible to identify the functional groups needed to determine the structure of the peat collected for the study the strongest absorption bands were found on the spectrogram at wave numbers of 1026 cm 1 776 cm 1 and 1590 cm 1 with the mean at levels of 3344 cm 1 and 2924 cm 1 peat test spectra from all deposits followed a similar course the exception was peat from the deposit in goczałkowice zdrój for which the strongest absorption bands were observed in the 850 1400 cm 1 range with the average in the 2950 3344 cm 1 range characteristic absorbance peaks at 1026 cm 1 indicate the presence of carbohydrate in the structure while peaks at 1590 cm 1 indicating the presence of carboxylate r coo spectra in the 2800 3000 cm 1 range suggest the presence of aliphatic ch2 and ch3 as well as the broad hydroxyl band centred at 3344 cm 1 38 peaks identified in the analyzed peat samples show a similarity to the ftir spectra of humic and fulvic acids extracted by tarchitzky et al 39 from the soils irrigated with fresh water and treated wastewater in the studied samples peat h bonds oh groups occur in the wave number 3200 3400 cm 1 range ch bands occur at 2924 cm 1 while cc in aromatic structures are identified at 2590 cm 1 with co stretching of polysaccharides at 1026 cm 1 fig 3 in contrast peak at 1426 cm 1 was clearly observed in the absorption spectra for peat from gz indicatives of carboxylates which include contributions of aromatic and aliphatic carboxylates r coo 40 the bands in the range of 1200 800 cm 1 are weak and correspond to the cc stretching vibrations these vibrations are of little importance for the identification of the compound 3 2 sorption of nickel ions from the model solution all the analyzed materials were characterized by a high nickel ion removal efficiency the analysis by means of the model solution allowed for determining the nickel content that can be removed from the solution as well as the effect of the contact time of the material with the solution on this process all the analyzed materials were characterized by a high nickel ion removal efficiency for the model solution with the initial concentration of about 10 mg dm3 very similar results were obtained for all materials what can be seen in fig 5a the use of even very short contact times 1 5 min has made it possible to reduce nickel to a level below 1 mg dm3 while extension to 3 h resulted in a near complete removal from the solution for a model solution with a higher concentration of about 100 mg dm3 differences between the individual materials for shorter contact times less than 3 h can be seen in fig 5b the lowest nickel concentrations in the order of 12 mg dm3 after 1 min were observed for peat gz but in the case of a longer time 5 min there was a change with the most effective being material kl for longer contact times kl peat remained the most effective material while pz peat was the least effective as it achieved the worst results for all analyzed contact times in this case after 1 min of stirring the ni concentration was reduced from the original form 100 to 42 mg dm3 after 5 min it dropped to 25 mg dm3 and then increased slightly to 10 min of contact it was only after 15 min that a uniform drop could be observed even though the effectiveness in removing ni was worse than that of other peats considered in the study 3 3 heavy metal ion sorption for an industrial solution observing the effectiveness of peat in removing nickel in the model solution and in further studies carried out with the use of an industrial solution the scope of analyses was extended thus allowing for the effectiveness of the material in removing other ions to be checked as well for tests with the use of an industrial solution its effectiveness in removing iron chromium nickel and copper was analyzed despite the nickel content similar to the tests with the model solution about 10 mg dm3 the industrial solution was also characterized by very high concentrations of other metals as a result it was decided to carry out the tests with larger amounts of material than in the case of the model solution which contained only nickel taking into account the previously presented results analyses were performed for material exposure at times of 3 h and 24 h in previous tests the 3 h time turned out to be sufficient for removing most of the nickel from the solution and after 24 h a further slight decrease in concentration was observed for all the analyzed metals the efficiency of metal ions removal increased as the amount of material used increased the charts showing the content of metal ions in the solution after 3 h and 24 h contact with materials are quite similar the same dependencies can be observed for both short and longer contact times for all the analyzed elements extending the contact time to 24 h resulted in only a slight increase in the effectiveness of metal removal with a simultaneous eightfold extension of the time this may suggest that there is no need to use such a long contact time for the analyzed materials the best results were achieved for the gz with the use of which the highest drops in the concentration of all analyzed metals in the solution were obtained it is particularly visible in fig 6 a b in the case of iron and chromium where even 1 g of the material allowed for practically a complete removal of these elements in the solution at both a contact time of 3 h and 24 h the ion contents of iron chromium nickel and copper at 24 h contact time decreased to values of 1 6 0 3 2 6 and 3 8 respectively the use of 4 g of gz material allowed for almost complete removal of the remaining two elements tested i e copper and nickel fig 6c d the worst results were achieved with the use of pz which for all elements showed the lowest reduction in metal concentration only the application of the maximum amount of analyzed material amounting to 8 g was it possible for the concentration to be reduced to values close to 0 mg dm3 metal ion removal efficiency increased along with the mass of the material used due to increasing of the contact surface this dependence is also observed in the case of other natural materials used as absorbents e g sphagnum moss peat 41 vinegar treated eggshell 10 or palm fibers 42 3 4 changes in ph values in an industrial solution at the stage of research with an industrial solution changes in ph were also analyzed for all tested materials taking into account their mass taken for the tests the industrial solution had an initial ph of 1 5 1 8 for all the tested materials the ph of the solution also increased along with the mass of the peat what can be seen in fig 7 however the dynamics of this process was different for each of the materials the highest ph values in the order of 6 5 of the solution were achieved with the use of peat gz while a sudden increase to ph 4 5 was observed even with a small mass amounting to 1 g of the material as the amount of material was further increased the increase in ph slowed material pz had the lowest impact on changes in ph when using different masses of material in the solution an increase was noted from ph 1 5 at 1 g to only 2 75 at 8 g on the basis of the conducted research on ph changes and the results of metal ion sorption presented in fig 6 a close relationship between them was noticed the higher the ph obtained after contact between the dry material and the industrial solution the higher the sorption capacity of the material in relation to fe cr ni cu ions the sorption capacity of the tested materials could be ranked in the following order gz ke kl kp wz pz the ph value has an enormous influence on the effectiveness of metal ion removal in the case of peat containing numerous acid functional groups change in ph may result in an increase or decrease in sorption capacity 30 for this reason in their works researchers have decided to correct the ph at the initial stage of the sorption process or use material modification 6 40 the influence of ph on the effectiveness of metal sorption using peat has been studied in many publications for ni2 and pb2 the optimal values were 5 0 7 0 30 for ni2 cu2 and cd2 they were 6 0 7 0 29 this explains the achievement of the best results for the gz material which was characterized by ph values in the range of 5 0 6 5 for the used material mass above 2 g according to the pourbaix diagram the use of ph values higher than 7 5 may cause precipitation of hydroxyl metal forms as evidenced by the lower optimal ph values obtained 3 5 sorption kinetic and efficiency the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models were used to determine the sorption kinetics for the pseudo second order model designated by ho 43 much better results were obtained than for the pseudo first order model proposed by lagergren the results of the pseudo second order model are presented in fig 8 while the calculated parameters are summarized in table 3 ho s kinetic model assumes that the rate of the adsorption process is proportional to the square of the adsorbate s equilibrium concentration difference after introducing the boundary conditions this model can be converted into a linear form as represented by eq 5 5 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where qe amount of adsorbed metal ions at equilibrium mg g qt amount of adsorbed metal ions in a given time t mg g k2 rate constant of the adsorption process of the pseudo second order model g mg min the pseudo second order model assumes that the speed of the sorption process is influenced by chemical interactions resulting in the binding of metal ions onto the adsorbent s surface complexing or ion exchange mechanisms summarizing the results on the adsorption kinetics it can be concluded that the process of metal ion adsorption fe cr ni cu on peat follows the pseudo second kinetics model which is consistent with reports in the literature similar results were achieved by bartczak et al 44 on natural peat for nickel and lead sorption and for copper in the studies by ho and mckay 45 in research by lodygin 46 on the complexation of lead and cadmium ions with humic acids from arctic peat soils it is shown that during the initial stage the kinetics of the process of sorption is better described by the pseudo second order equation in a work by bulgariu et al 47 the pseudo second order model best describes the adsorption kinetics of heavy metal ions pb ii co ii and ni ii onto the natural and alkaline treated peat when analysing fig 9 on the effectiveness of metal removal from wastewater two very different areas can be noticed initially at lower concentrations almost 100 of the iron and chromium are removed from the solution while the efficiency of nickel and copper removal gradually decreases with increasing initial concentration when the initial concentration in the raw wastewater is above 1500 mg dm3 a sudden decrease in effectiveness can be observed for chromium iron and nickel above 2700 mg dm3 the iron and chromium removal efficiency drops to zero after a sudden significant decrease the nickel removal efficiency remains constant at around 8 10 even with a significant increase in the initial concentration only copper is stable and suddenly the collapse visible for the other elements does not occur in the case of copper only a slightly faster decrease in effectiveness in the first area can be noticed before it starts slowing down the maximum sorption capacity for the analyzed material in the case of an industrial solution was 24 16 5 86 0 23 and 0 48 mg g for iron chromium nickel and cooper respectively for laboratory solution porter and mckay 48 reported sorption capacity for peat of 0 17 mg g for nickel and 0 20 mg g for cooper the sorption capacity for chromium as calculated by balan et al 49 was 6 88 mg g and in bartczak et al 44 it was 61 27 and 82 31 mg g for nickel and lead respectively for nickel removal by brazil peat lattuada et al 50 obtained sorption capacity of 14 mg g and for irish peat 11 42 by liu et al 51 peat as a sorbent as well as for many other organic materials shows great potential for regeneration and reuse after the sorption process peat can be acid washed to desorb contaminants and then reused gogoi et al 8 proved that after such regeneration the material contains the same functional groups as the fresh material thus indicating its stability chieng et al 52 observed that in the case of the spent peat desorption process using base treatment was effective with the material was still productive even after five cycles the authors found that peat can be effectively regenerated and reused in the case of heavy metals loaded peat regeneration with the use and reuse of the hcl solution allowed for slightly lower values in recovery percentages in the case of all analyzed metals pb co and ni the obtained values of decline in efficiency were about 5 which means that the material can be reused in several sorption and desorption cycles 48 a more viable option regarding the reuse of recovered peat would be to use the peat for energy production which is what most peat is used for in finland 53 3 6 the sorption mechanism peat as an organic material is an interesting material for observing the mechanisms and factors influencing the binding of metals with organic constituents according to many studies on sorption using peat various reactions may be proposed as responsible for this process such as ion exchange surface physical adsorption chemisorption complexation and adsorptive complexation 29 46 54 research thus designates that peat has good adsorption properties for many metal ions in the case of granulated peat the following metal binding sequence of fe iii cu ii cr iii zn ii ni ii has been presented and in other studies the same author also presented the following cation chelation capacity for peat fe iii pb ii ba ii cu ii ni ii for immobilized biomass peat beads the authors noted a similar relationship with the results indicating the following order fe al cu cd zn ca mn mg na 29 additionally it was emphasized that all analyzed metal ions were consistent with the pattern for which the higher charged ion was having a higher affinity in the case of the conducted research the authors noticed a similar relationship for the sorption of heavy metals from industrial solution iron was removed first while nickel was the most difficult to remove from the solution functional groups included in peat such as carboxylic acid and phenolic hydroxide groups react with metals to release protons and at high ph their anionic sites attract the available metals 54 the form of ion exchange is commonly considered to be a major absorption mechanism li et al 55 and dahiya et al 56 used low cost adsorbents for the removal of toxic metal ions and confirmed a mechanism based on ion exchange or on the formation of complexes with functional groups present on the adsorbent s surface bartczak et al 44 suggested a mechanism based on ion exchange by the carboxyl groups derived from a carbonyl group phenolic hydroxyl and ether groups with positively charged ions of nickel ii or lead ii in their research santos et al 51 confirmed that for humin derived from peat soil the most reasonable mechanism for sorption of pollutants from an aqueous solution was binding to coo while the dominance of coo as the main active side in sorption indicates that the sorbent s surface was energetically uniform ft ir tests of all analyzed materials showed that the obtained spectra are similar to each other the main difference can be observed in the case of gz material which had the highest effectiveness in our studies the analysis of the specter for this material shows a peak at 1426 cm 1 which is indicative of carboxylates and thus includes contributions of aromatic and aliphatic carboxylates r coo this may have an impact on the increased sorption capacity unlike the other materials 4 conclusion the conducted research has made it possible to ascertain the feasibility of using natural materials peat to remove metal ions from industrial solutions it is a particularly interesting issue due to the low ph of the tested solutions and the opportunity of using this type of material without the need for additional ph correction the sorption capacity of peats from 5 health resorts in poland goczałkowice zdrój połczyn zdrój kołobrzeg kamień pomorski wieniec zdrój was compared due to their similarity all tested materials were effective in removing metal ions at a similar level in tests using a model solution containing nickel at a lower initial concentration about 10 mg dm3 all materials were able to reduce the content of this element within a very short time 1 5 min to a level below 1 mg dm3 for higher initial concentrations almost complete reduction in the solution s nickel concentration was achieved after using a contact time of 24 h or more there was a convergence between the effectiveness of reducing metal concentrations by specific materials and the ph values the higher the ph values for the industrial solution after contact with a given material the greater was its effectiveness in reducing the content of ions of the analyzed metals the analysis of the industrial solution s ph after 24 h of contact with the materials showed

13494,the use of natural materials for wastewater treatment is a rapidly evolving issue natural materials are often low cost or waste materials and they are readily available in the case of industrial wastewater treatment the use of natural sorbents for the removal of heavy metals has shown positive results for many of the materials tested however there are ample reports in the literature of successes based solely on prepared solutions and laboratory trials which may not actually be as effective when applied under industrial conditions in the present work the possibility of using polish peat from 5 health resorts połczyn zdrój goczałkowice zdrój wieniec zdrój kamień pomorski and kołobrzeg as a sorbent for heavy metals in industrial wastewater from the steel electropolishing process is investigated the materials were characterized and then sorption tests using both laboratory and industrial wastewater solutions were performed the peat used turned out to be an effective material for both model laboratory and industrial wastewater characterized by high initial concentrations of metals such as iron chromium nickel and copper removal rate for initial concentration of 1000 mg dm3

environment without prior ph correction graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biosorption non conventional adsorbents wastewater nickel ftir 1 introduction pollution of the natural environment with toxic compounds through the increasing use of heavy metals in different industrial applications has become a key issue in natural ecosystems heavy metals are characterized by high mobility relatively high chemical stability and carcinogenicity since they are not degradable they accumulate in the environment making them one of the most dangerous contaminants in such systems and generating a risk to human health even a slight excess in the body s permissible concentration can cause numerous disorders and diseases which in turn may lead to death 1 3 from the viewpoint of infrastructure development and new technologies nickel is an important element due to its wide use in the production of stainless steel and alloys as well as in the plating industry and the production of batteries it is very important to meet the standards required by law for discharged nickel containing wastewater removal of nickel from industrial wastewater often poses a challenge especially in the case of wastewater from the steel electropolishing process due to the formation of complexes that hinder the removal process various methods are being used to remove metals from steel processing wastewater such as filtration ion exchange reverse osmosis electro deposition with the most common being those based on chemical precipitation 4 5 each of these methods has varying degrees of effectiveness and advantages as well as limitations out of concern for the natural environment the search for new eco friendly technologies that can be an alternative to traditionally used methods has in recent years become a trend the use of various types of materials of natural origin such as clay materials zeolites or biomass has been described in the literature 5 7 researchers have also tried to improve the effectiveness of these materials by modifying them 8 10 another direction is researching the possibility of using waste natural materials which in most cases are produced in significant quantities and are readily available at a very low cost spent tea leaves coffee waste fruits peels or nuts shells can be used to remove heavy metal ions 11 13 their disposal through re use may not only contribute to reducing the amount of waste but may also play an important role in the economy 6 14 however in many cases the studies conducted do not provide a clear answer to the question of whether these solutions may be used under industrial conditions for the removal of metals e g zinc chromium nickel copper from an industrial wastewater flow gogoi et al 7 used hydrochloric acid treated peat and citric acid treated sawdust the applied hcl treated peat and citric acid treated sawdust were more effective in removing nickel chromium and zinc from industrial wastewater than the commercially available mineral sorbent the use of bamboo activated carbon for nickel removal from electroplating industry wastewater made it possible to obtain a maximum of 98 7 efficiency in the case of using the most optimal values for all tested process parameters such as adsorbent dosage agitation speed particle size concentration contact time and ph level in their work sivaprakash et al 15 used fresh water algae zygnema sp as a low cost adsorbent for the removal of nickel from electroplating wastewater biosorbent was found to be efficient as 76 4 removal was observed at optimal conditions of ph contact time and dosage 16 the possible use of peat as a natural adsorbent has been noticed by several researchers peat has been used to remove various pollutants in many different types of effluent that include the atmosphere and groundwater 17 landfill leachates 18 septic tank effluent 19 mine drainage water 20 21 food processing wastewater 22 and oil spills 23 removal capabilities have been studied in terms of among other things odors 24 pesticides 25 n p and suspended solids 26 bod and ammonia 18 for the use of peat as a filtration material it s effectiveness is often assessed in terms of its use as one or the only layer in filter bed systems peat column peat bed reactor filter plant such solutions can only be used in small scale systems with a low hydraulic loading rate 27 28 and may not be suitable for large volumes of wastewater disposal several studies have established the potential of peat to capture dissolved metals 29 31 these found that peat is a valuable adsorbent and due to its polar character the adsorption potential for dissolved metals is quite high the metal removal efficiency of peat is highly dependent on ph cameron 32 found that better removals of metals fe mn zn k na ca mg and pb were achieved at a ph of 8 4 than 4 8 leiviskä et al 30 have conducted research at ph 5 6 while ho et al 28 have shown that the optimum range of ph for batching the adsorption of ni ii onto the sphagnum moss peat was 4 0 7 0 this ph range is also considered optimal by bartczak et al 29 and liu et al 33 similarly gardea torresdey et al 34 found that sphagnum peat moss could intake cu ii at a ph of 4 0 the peak adsorption for zn ii onto peat has been found to occur at a ph of over 5 5 for cd ii at a ph of over 5 0 and for ni ii the range was 4 0 7 0 with an optimum at 7 35 gosset et al 32 observed that as the ph decreased the metal removal efficiency decreased below ph 3 5 the removal of most metal ions from solution ceases with cr iv being an exception the results of the studies presented in the literature show that the optimum ph varies depending on the metal to be removed however most of the research have been conducted on effluents whose ph is within the above mentioned range i e in the optimal range ph 4 7 for as shown by the results of previous studies below ph 3 0 the peat chelating capacity decreases and at ph 9 0 the peat s structure degrades however with industrial wastewater there are some industries that generate acidic wastewater such wastewater includes those from the electropolishing process of chromium nickel steels which are the focus of analyses in this article reports of the use of peat for metal removal in acidic environments are negligible one of the most frequently mentioned limitations of these systems is the rapidly progressing clogging process which reduces their efficiency within a relatively short period after installation in recent years there has been a trend towards centralizing wastewater management aiming to close down small wastewater treatment plants thereby ensuring better supervision and a higher degree of wastewater treatment increased quality requirements also apply to the discharged industrial wastewater for these reasons it is important to use technology whereby the quality standards for all determined parameters are met it is even more interesting to ascertain whether peat which has been appreciated by many researchers due to its effectiveness in so many types of effluents will be able to remove metals from aggressive wastewater with low ph values the aim of this study is to assess the use of peat from five health resorts in poland to remove heavy metal ions the research assessed the effectiveness of metal removal nickel iron chromium and copper from industrial wastewater issuing from the electropolishing process of chromium nickel steels after the initial drying and grinding the organic material was used for sorption tests using both the model solution and industrial wastewater for the most promising of the analyzed material the sorption capacity removal percentage and kinetics model was determined the sorption process was carried out in wide range of initial heavy metals concentrations and an acidic environment which is a non standard approach for this type of process but which is carried out in most cases in an alkaline or neutral environment the selection of an acidic environment for the research stemmed from the need to reflect as much as possible the actual nature of the industrial wastewater under investigation 2 experimental procedures 2 1 materials the research used materials from various health resorts in poland połczyn zdrój pz goczałkowice zdrój gz wieniec zdrój wz kamień pomorski kp and kołobrzeg for which two materials with commercial names therapeutic peat kl and peat extra ke were analyzed the materials were dried at 105 c for 24 h and then ground to a powder to obtain particles size uniformity 2 2 chemicals analitical grade nickel iii nitrate ni no3 2 x 6h2o was used to prepare a model solution containing a specific concentration of nickel the industrial wastewater solution from a steel processing plant located in wrocław contained concentrated phosphoric acid v and sulphuric acid vi with the addition of triethanolamine industrial stock solution was used for industrial purposes for a

of peat used in the research began with the determination of the percentage of organic and mineral substances as well as the moisture content for this purpose the material samples were weighed evaporated at 100 c then burned in an oven at 550 c and reweighed one of the sedimentation methods was used to determine the granulometric distribution of peat i e casagrande s areometric method in modification by prószyński this method is based on measuring the falling velocity of various size soil particles in still water the measurement is performed using a hydrometer and lasts for about 24 h the depth of the hydrometer immersion in the suspension depends on the density of suspension which changes with time as successive fractions of particles with smaller diameters fall to the bottom of the vessel with the tested suspension a detailed description of the procedure for measuring with this method can be found in the literature 36 for the determined particle size curves the non uniformity index cu and the grain curvature index cc were calculated using eqs 3 and 4 3 c u d 60 d 10 4 c c d 30 2 d 60 d 10 where d 10 d 30 d 60 are particle diameters which together with the smaller ones account for 10 30 and 60 of the sample mass peat respectively sem images were taken to visualize the materials used in the study the morphology of materials was examined by tescan vega ii sbh an electron scanning microscope in order to analyze the elemental composition the samples were tested for carbon hydrogen and nitrogen content using the ea 1110 chns elemental composition analyzer by ce instruments and icp oes inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy tests using the thermo scientific icap 7000 series icp oes apparatus with an automated sample feeder and software manufactured by qtegra intelligent scientific data solution the infrared absorption spectroscopy technique was used to measure the peat structure measurements were made on a thermo scientific nicolet iz10 ft ir fourier transformation infrared spectrometer with the module of thermo scientific nicolet in10 mx microscope equipped with a smart itx accessory and a diamond plate in the area of the electromagnetic spectrum with wavelength reciprocal of wavelength ranging from 4000 to 400 cm 1 i e primary infrared area this range is most applicable to the structure of organic compounds the device made it possible to measure the attenuated total reflectance atr technique ftir atr spectroscopy is a technique that requires minimum sample preparation apart from drying them making it possible to analyze a large number of samples within a short time in addition to being highly cost effective it is one such method that gives information on the broad chemical groups present depending on the available absorption peaks 37 to obtain ftir spectra 32 scans were collected at the 4 cm 1 spectral resolution 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of peat before carrying out tests to check the peat s effectiveness in removing heavy metals from industrial wastewater the material was subjected to detailed tests to ascertain their properties the analysis of the percentage of organic and mineral substances presented in fig 1 showed a significant similarity between all the tested materials both for raw samples in the natural state brought by the company and dried samples all raw materials were characterized by their high water content ranging from 73 to 92 the highest content of organic substances in dry matter was observed for the wz and kl peat at 87 and 86 respectively the lowest amount of organic substances was found in peat pz at 68 and gz at 73 then the granulometric composition of the materials was tested after drying and grinding and presented in fig 2 in most peat types kl ke gz kp particles in the range 0 006 1 mm were identified fig 2 only in the wz and pz samples were there also smaller particles 0 002 mm although as in the other samples the largest did not exceed 1 mm 60 of all grains in the peat were material with a granulation in the range of 0 25 0 6 mm the high values of the index cu 15 which were observed in the peat bogs of gz kl kp and ke prove the material s enormous diversity a slightly less variety of grains is characteristic of peat wz cu 8 8 while in peat pz unlike the others the material was uniformly grained cu index 5 all of the tested materials were multi fractionated cc 1 3 while small fractions filled the empty spaces between the larger grains the results of the particle size distribution correspond to the sem results presented in fig 3 it can be seen in the images that the largest particles of the material after drying and grinding are less than 1 mm in size it is noted that there are significantly more particles with sizes in the range of 0 1 1 mm smaller particles are also present but in a much smaller amount the results of elemental composition carbon hydrogen nitrogen and icp oes presented in tables 1 and 2 respectively le indicate a great similarity among all analyzed materials the c h n ratio for the best performing material is 83 12 5 and for the worst material 87 10 3 respectively the sulfur content ranged from 2856 to 12 292 mg kg the samples had a high iron content for kl gz and ke materials it exceeded 10 000 mg kg while wi was characterized by a much lower iron content at below 2000 mg kg for the remaining materials the obtained results were within the limits 5500 6000 mg kg in all materials tested no nickel was detected and low levels of copper at up to about 10 mg kg were also detected in the case of chromium the amounts were also quite low ranging from 10 to 30 m kg except for the pz material which was over 120 mg kg the analysis of the ft ir absorption spectra shown in fig 4 made it possible to identify the functional groups needed to determine the structure of the peat collected for the study the strongest absorption bands were found on the spectrogram at wave numbers of 1026 cm 1 776 cm 1 and 1590 cm 1 with the mean at levels of 3344 cm 1 and 2924 cm 1 peat test spectra from all deposits followed a similar course the exception was peat from the deposit in goczałkowice zdrój for which the strongest absorption bands were observed in the 850 1400 cm 1 range with the average in the 2950 3344 cm 1 range characteristic absorbance peaks at 1026 cm 1 indicate the presence of carbohydrate in the structure while peaks at 1590 cm 1 indicating the presence of carboxylate r coo spectra in the 2800 3000 cm 1 range suggest the presence of aliphatic ch2 and ch3 as well as the broad hydroxyl band centred at 3344 cm 1 38 peaks identified in the analyzed peat samples show a similarity to the ftir spectra of humic and fulvic acids extracted by tarchitzky et al 39 from the soils irrigated with fresh water and treated wastewater in the studied samples peat h bonds oh groups occur in the wave number 3200 3400 cm 1 range ch bands occur at 2924 cm 1 while cc in aromatic structures are identified at 2590 cm 1 with co stretching of polysaccharides at 1026 cm 1 fig 3 in contrast peak at 1426 cm 1 was clearly observed in the absorption spectra for peat from gz indicatives of carboxylates which include contributions of aromatic and aliphatic carboxylates r coo 40 the bands in the range of 1200 800 cm 1 are weak and correspond to the cc stretching vibrations these vibrations are of little importance for the identification of the compound 3 2 sorption of nickel ions from the model solution all the analyzed materials were characterized by a high nickel ion removal efficiency the analysis by means of the model solution allowed for determining the nickel content that can be removed from the solution as well as the effect of the contact time of the material with the solution on this process all the analyzed materials were characterized by a high nickel ion removal efficiency for the model solution with the initial concentration of about 10 mg dm3 very similar results were obtained for all materials what can be seen in fig 5a the use of even very short contact times 1 5 min has made it possible to reduce nickel to a level below 1 mg dm3 while extension to 3 h resulted in a near complete removal from the solution for a model solution with a higher concentration of about 100 mg dm3 differences between the individual materials for shorter contact times less than 3 h can be seen in fig 5b the lowest nickel concentrations in the order of 12 mg dm3 after 1 min were observed for peat gz but in the case of a longer time 5 min there was a change with the most effective being material kl for longer contact times kl peat remained the most effective material while pz peat was the least effective as it achieved the worst results for all analyzed contact times in this case after 1 min of stirring the ni concentration was reduced from the original form 100 to 42 mg dm3 after 5 min it dropped to 25 mg dm3 and then increased slightly to 10 min of contact it was only after 15 min that a uniform drop could be observed even though the effectiveness in removing ni was worse than that of other peats considered in the study 3 3 heavy metal ion sorption for an industrial solution observing the effectiveness of peat in removing nickel in the model solution and in further studies carried out with the use of an industrial solution the scope of analyses was extended thus allowing for the effectiveness of the material in removing other ions to be checked as well for tests with the use of an industrial solution its effectiveness in removing iron chromium nickel and copper was analyzed despite the nickel content similar to the tests with the model solution about 10 mg dm3 the industrial solution was also characterized by very high concentrations of other metals as a result it was decided to carry out the tests with larger amounts of material than in the case of the model solution which contained only nickel taking into account the previously presented results analyses were performed for material exposure at times of 3 h and 24 h in previous tests the 3 h time turned out to be sufficient for removing most of the nickel from the solution and after 24 h a further slight decrease in concentration was observed for all the analyzed metals the efficiency of metal ions removal increased as the amount of material used increased the charts showing the content of metal ions in the solution after 3 h and 24 h contact with materials are quite similar the same dependencies can be observed for both short and longer contact times for all the analyzed elements extending the contact time to 24 h resulted in only a slight increase in the effectiveness of metal removal with a simultaneous eightfold extension of the time this may suggest that there is no need to use such a long contact time for the analyzed materials the best results were achieved for the gz with the use of which the highest drops in the concentration of all analyzed metals in the solution were obtained it is particularly visible in fig 6 a b in the case of iron and chromium where even 1 g of the material allowed for practically a complete removal of these elements in the solution at both a contact time of 3 h and 24 h the ion contents of iron chromium nickel and copper at 24 h contact time decreased to values of 1 6 0 3 2 6 and 3 8 respectively the use of 4 g of gz material allowed for almost complete removal of the remaining two elements tested i e copper and nickel fig 6c d the worst results were achieved with the use of pz which for all elements showed the lowest reduction in metal concentration only the application of the maximum amount of analyzed material amounting to 8 g was it possible for the concentration to be reduced to values close to 0 mg dm3 metal ion removal efficiency increased along with the mass of the material used due to increasing of the contact surface this dependence is also observed in the case of other natural materials used as absorbents e g sphagnum moss peat 41 vinegar treated eggshell 10 or palm fibers 42 3 4 changes in ph values in an industrial solution at the stage of research with an industrial solution changes in ph were also analyzed for all tested materials taking into account their mass taken for the tests the industrial solution had an initial ph of 1 5 1 8 for all the tested materials the ph of the solution also increased along with the mass of the peat what can be seen in fig 7 however the dynamics of this process was different for each of the materials the highest ph values in the order of 6 5 of the solution were achieved with the use of peat gz while a sudden increase to ph 4 5 was observed even with a small mass amounting to 1 g of the material as the amount of material was further increased the increase in ph slowed material pz had the lowest impact on changes in ph when using different masses of material in the solution an increase was noted from ph 1 5 at 1 g to only 2 75 at 8 g on the basis of the conducted research on ph changes and the results of metal ion sorption presented in fig 6 a close relationship between them was noticed the higher the ph obtained after contact between the dry material and the industrial solution the higher the sorption capacity of the material in relation to fe cr ni cu ions the sorption capacity of the tested materials could be ranked in the following order gz ke kl kp wz pz the ph value has an enormous influence on the effectiveness of metal ion removal in the case of peat containing numerous acid functional groups change in ph may result in an increase or decrease in sorption capacity 30 for this reason in their works researchers have decided to correct the ph at the initial stage of the sorption process or use material modification 6 40 the influence of ph on the effectiveness of metal sorption using peat has been studied in many publications for ni2 and pb2 the optimal values were 5 0 7 0 30 for ni2 cu2 and cd2 they were 6 0 7 0 29 this explains the achievement of the best results for the gz material which was characterized by ph values in the range of 5 0 6 5 for the used material mass above 2 g according to the pourbaix diagram the use of ph values higher than 7 5 may cause precipitation of hydroxyl metal forms as evidenced by the lower optimal ph values obtained 3 5 sorption kinetic and efficiency the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models were used to determine the sorption kinetics for the pseudo second order model designated by ho 43 much better results were obtained than for the pseudo first order model proposed by lagergren the results of the pseudo second order model are presented in fig 8 while the calculated parameters are summarized in table 3 ho s kinetic model assumes that the rate of the adsorption process is proportional to the square of the adsorbate s equilibrium concentration difference after introducing the boundary conditions this model can be converted into a linear form as represented by eq 5 5 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where qe amount of adsorbed metal ions at equilibrium mg g qt amount of adsorbed metal ions in a given time t mg g k2 rate constant of the adsorption process of the pseudo second order model g mg min the pseudo second order model assumes that the speed of the sorption process is influenced by chemical interactions resulting in the binding of metal ions onto the adsorbent s surface complexing or ion exchange mechanisms summarizing the results on the adsorption kinetics it can be concluded that the process of metal ion adsorption fe cr ni cu on peat follows the pseudo second kinetics model which is consistent with reports in the literature similar results were achieved by bartczak et al 44 on natural peat for nickel and lead sorption and for copper in the studies by ho and mckay 45 in research by lodygin 46 on the complexation of lead and cadmium ions with humic acids from arctic peat soils it is shown that during the initial stage the kinetics of the process of sorption is better described by the pseudo second order equation in a work by bulgariu et al 47 the pseudo second order model best describes the adsorption kinetics of heavy metal ions pb ii co ii and ni ii onto the natural and alkaline treated peat when analysing fig 9 on the effectiveness of metal removal from wastewater two very different areas can be noticed initially at lower concentrations almost 100 of the iron and chromium are removed from the solution while the efficiency of nickel and copper removal gradually decreases with increasing initial concentration when the initial concentration in the raw wastewater is above 1500 mg dm3 a sudden decrease in effectiveness can be observed for chromium iron and nickel above 2700 mg dm3 the iron and chromium removal efficiency drops to zero after a sudden significant decrease the nickel removal efficiency remains constant at around 8 10 even with a significant increase in the initial concentration only copper is stable and suddenly the collapse visible for the other elements does not occur in the case of copper only a slightly faster decrease in effectiveness in the first area can be noticed before it starts slowing down the maximum sorption capacity for the analyzed material in the case of an industrial solution was 24 16 5 86 0 23 and 0 48 mg g for iron chromium nickel and cooper respectively for laboratory solution porter and mckay 48 reported sorption capacity for peat of 0 17 mg g for nickel and 0 20 mg g for cooper the sorption capacity for chromium as calculated by balan et al 49 was 6 88 mg g and in bartczak et al 44 it was 61 27 and 82 31 mg g for nickel and lead respectively for nickel removal by brazil peat lattuada et al 50 obtained sorption capacity of 14 mg g and for irish peat 11 42 by liu et al 51 peat as a sorbent as well as for many other organic materials shows great potential for regeneration and reuse after the sorption process peat can be acid washed to desorb contaminants and then reused gogoi et al 8 proved that after such regeneration the material contains the same functional groups as the fresh material thus indicating its stability chieng et al 52 observed that in the case of the spent peat desorption process using base treatment was effective with the material was still productive even after five cycles the authors found that peat can be effectively regenerated and reused in the case of heavy metals loaded peat regeneration with the use and reuse of the hcl solution allowed for slightly lower values in recovery percentages in the case of all analyzed metals pb co and ni the obtained values of decline in efficiency were about 5 which means that the material can be reused in several sorption and desorption cycles 48 a more viable option regarding the reuse of recovered peat would be to use the peat for energy production which is what most peat is used for in finland 53 3 6 the sorption mechanism peat as an organic material is an interesting material for observing the mechanisms and factors influencing the binding of metals with organic constituents according to many studies on sorption using peat various reactions may be proposed as responsible for this process such as ion exchange surface physical adsorption chemisorption complexation and adsorptive complexation 29 46 54 research thus designates that peat has good adsorption properties for many metal ions in the case of granulated peat the following metal binding sequence of fe iii cu ii cr iii zn ii ni ii has been presented and in other studies the same author also presented the following cation chelation capacity for peat fe iii pb ii ba ii cu ii ni ii for immobilized biomass peat beads the authors noted a similar relationship with the results indicating the following order fe al cu cd zn ca mn mg na 29 additionally it was emphasized that all analyzed metal ions were consistent with the pattern for which the higher charged ion was having a higher affinity in the case of the conducted research the authors noticed a similar relationship for the sorption of heavy metals from industrial solution iron was removed first while nickel was the most difficult to remove from the solution functional groups included in peat such as carboxylic acid and phenolic hydroxide groups react with metals to release protons and at high ph their anionic sites attract the available metals 54 the form of ion exchange is commonly considered to be a major absorption mechanism li et al 55 and dahiya et al 56 used low cost adsorbents for the removal of toxic metal ions and confirmed a mechanism based on ion exchange or on the formation of complexes with functional groups present on the adsorbent s surface bartczak et al 44 suggested a mechanism based on ion exchange by the carboxyl groups derived from a carbonyl group phenolic hydroxyl and ether groups with positively charged ions of nickel ii or lead ii in their research santos et al 51 confirmed that for humin derived from peat soil the most reasonable mechanism for sorption of pollutants from an aqueous solution was binding to coo while the dominance of coo as the main active side in sorption indicates that the sorbent s surface was energetically uniform ft ir tests of all analyzed materials showed that the obtained spectra are similar to each other the main difference can be observed in the case of gz material which had the highest effectiveness in our studies the analysis of the specter for this material shows a peak at 1426 cm 1 which is indicative of carboxylates and thus includes contributions of aromatic and aliphatic carboxylates r coo this may have an impact on the increased sorption capacity unlike the other materials 4 conclusion the conducted research has made it possible to ascertain the feasibility of using natural materials peat to remove metal ions from industrial solutions it is a particularly interesting issue due to the low ph of the tested solutions and the opportunity of using this type of material without the need for additional ph correction the sorption capacity of peats from 5 health resorts in poland goczałkowice zdrój połczyn zdrój kołobrzeg kamień pomorski wieniec zdrój was compared due to their similarity all tested materials were effective in removing metal ions at a similar level in tests using a model solution containing nickel at a lower initial concentration about 10 mg dm3 all materials were able to reduce the content of this element within a very short time 1 5 min to a level below 1 mg dm3 for higher initial concentrations almost complete reduction in the solution s nickel concentration was achieved after using a contact time of 24 h or more there was a convergence between the effectiveness of reducing metal concentrations by specific materials and the ph values the higher the ph values for the industrial solution after contact with a given material the greater was its effectiveness in reducing the content of ions of the analyzed metals the analysis of the industrial solution s ph after 24 h of contact with the materials showed that the biggest increase in ph was observed for the gz material which was also the most effective the results obtained for the best of the tested materials goczałkowice zdrój gz suggest that the process of metal ion adsorption fe cr ni cu using peat follows the pseudo second kinetics model this kinetic model assumes that the speed of the sorption process is influenced by chemical interactions resulting in the binding of metal ions on the adsorbent s surface complexing or ion exchange mechanisms in the case of using an industrial solution the maximum sorption capacity for the analyzed material was 24 16 5 86 0 23 and 0 48 mg g for iron chromium nickel and cooper respectively at lower concentrations almost 100 of the iron and chromium are removed from the solution while the efficiency of nickel and copper removal gradually decreases with increasing initial concentration removal capacity of the peat indicates the following order fe iii cr iii cu ii ni ii due to the high metal removal efficiency 99 100 for fe and cr as well as 60 70 for cu and ni in acidic industrial wastewater with a high initial metal concentration up to 1500 mg dm3 the obtained results are promising with a view to using these natural materials in industrial conditions credit authorship contribution statement sylwia charazińska conceptualization investigation writing original draft
