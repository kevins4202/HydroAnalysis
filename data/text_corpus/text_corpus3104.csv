15520,many refractory organic compounds rocs in wastewater are toxic to human and aquatic organisms here we reported an aerobic starvation approach to improve the degradation efficiencies of rocs in activated sludge systems the highest degradation rates of bisphenol af bpaf 11 4 mg g vss h and gabapentin gbp 8 9 mg g vss h were achieved on the second day of the starvation process while the degradation rate of bisphenol a bpa on the 43rd day reached the maximum value of 0 8 mg g vss h which was significantly higher than that of the seeding sludge 0 01 mg g vss h to investigate the mechanisms of this finding we applied magnetic nanoparticle mediated isolation 16s rrna gene sequencing metagenomic sequencing and metatranscriptomic sequencing to analyze the microbial community structures and functions during the starvation process the results showed that the increase of the bpa degradation ability was caused by the increase of the relative abundance of bpa degrading bacteria sphingomonas achromobacter etc while the enhancement of bpaf and gbp degradation was attributed to the increase of the expression of roc degrading genes overall these results improve our understanding of the microbial ecology of starved activated sludge and provide useful information for the future development of roc removal technologies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords refractory organic compounds activated sludge metagenomic sequencing metatranscriptomic sequencing data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction refractory organic compounds rocs are widely present in various water environments such as wastewater surface water and even drinking water at different concentrations pan et al 2016 petrie et al 2015 and have attracted widespread attention due to their potential risks these rocs mainly include pharmaceuticals personal care products industrial materials and other toxic chemicals discharged from factories and households liu and wong 2013 although discharged wastewater containing rocs is treated in wastewater treatment plants wwtps many rocs cannot be completely removed and are discharged into natural environments through the effluent liu and wong 2013 despite the roc presence in the environment their concentrations are usually relatively low nevertheless their toxicity and potential risks to human health and aquatic organisms cannot be ignored petrie et al 2015 therefore it is of great significance to develop effective treatment technologies to remove harmful rocs from wastewater it is well known that most rocs do not always respond to biodegradation by microorganisms some of which are highly toxic to microorganisms petrie et al 2015 although studies have shown that physical and chemical processes such as activated carbon adsorption powdered activated carbon ultrafiltration hybrid process ozone biofiltration and fenton process can remove rocs from wastewater with relatively good removal efficiencies biological methods are still highly attractive when considering the operating cost and operational complexity ahmed et al 2021 to overcome the low biodegradation efficiency of rocs biological acclimation and bioaugmentation have been proposed and used into practice by many researchers and engineers cheng et al 2021 by applying these approaches certain functional microorganisms which are capable of removing the pollutants can proliferate and dominate in the biological treatment processes pure culture bacteria with high efficiency roc degradation abilities have been isolated from various environments low et al 2019 however it is difficult to implement bioaugmentation in engineering practice due to the low adaptability of pure culture exogenous bacteria in wastewater treatment bioreactors nzila et al 2016 compared with pure culture bacteria the applications of mixed culture and indigenous bacteria are more practical and diverse bacteria in a mixed system can promote the degradation of organic compounds through synergistic effects el fantroussi and agathos 2005 for example the mixed culture of ammonia oxidizing and heterotrophic bacteria has been proven capable of enhancing the removal of complex organics sun et al 2019b the conventional approach to obtain cultures with high roc degradation abilities is to acclimate the microbial community of the seeding activated sludge or other inoculum to specific rocs by enhancing biodegradation efficiency with an improved resistance to a high loading or loading shock kamali et al 2019 traditional startup processes of activated sludge reactors are based on this acclimation method and are widely used in research and engineering practices boonnorat et al 2021 however this approach is dependent of wastewater with high concentrations of specific rocs kamali et al 2019 in addition the acclimatization process could be long with a possibility of failure inaba et al 2020 a previous study showed that aerobic starvation treatment could significantly change the microbial community of activated sludge and some bacterial species were enriched during the starvation process liu et al 2017 besides some other studies showed that starvation may affect the nitrifying microorganisms in biological wastewater treatment systems elawwad et al 2013 torà et al 2010 however little is known about the organic matter degradation ability of the starved sludge in this study we found that aerobic starvation treatment can improve the degradation ability of activated sludge on some rocs to investigate the mechanisms we explored the microbial community shift during the aerobic starvation based on 16s rrna gene sequencing we also identified possible bacteria involved in the roc degradation process based on magnetic nanoparticle mediated isolation mmi zhang et al 2015 compared dna stable isotope probing method the mmi method does not require specific stable isotope 13c or 15n labelled substrates and has been successfully used to analyze the functional bacteria wang et al 2016 furthermore by using metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing the key bacterial functions and the functional gene expression profiles during the aerobic starvation process were also systematically analyzed based on these findings we revealed the reasons of the increased degradation ability and proposed potential applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 aerobic starvation treatment of sludge the activated sludge used for starvation treatment was collected from the aeration tank of a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp where anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2o process is applied the activated sludge was put in a 10 l glass container and continuous aeration was performed to maintain the dissolved oxygen concentration above 2 mg l and a total of three replicate experiments were conducted the starvation process lasted for 68 days and no nutrients were added during this process sludge samples were collected every day at the initial period and every several days after day 4 to analyze the degradation ability of different rocs including gabapentin gbp bisphenol a bpa bisphenol af bpaf diclofenac dcf and ibuprofen ibu in addition the activated sludge samples were also collected from the 10 l glass container regularly for subsequent dna and rna extraction the activated sludge directly collected from the aeration tank of the same wwtp regular activated sludge was used as control without starvation to analyze the roc degradation ability 2 2 roc degradation analysis for roc degradation the sludge samples were first centrifuged at 3000 xg for 10 min then the supernatant was discarded and the sludge was washed three times with 1xpbs solution to investigate the effect of adsorption control experiment with sterilized sludge was also carried out the roc degradation analysis was performed in 250 ml glass containers for each sludge the degradation analysis was conducted in triplicate the initial roc gbp bpaf bpa dcf and ibu concentration in the artificial wastewater was 10 mg l other nutrients include 76 mg l of nh4cl 100 mg l of mgso4 7h2o 30 mg l of cacl2 2h2o 17 mg l of kh2po4 80 mg l of feso4 7h2o 100 μg l of mncl2 4h2o 20 μg l of namoo4 2h2o 10 μg l of cuso4 5h2o 2 μg l of cocl2 6h2o and 50 μg l of znso4 7h2o in order to minimize the impact of adsorption the sludge concentration was maintained at 100 mg l in addition we also investigated the degradation efficiency of starved sludge on low concentration rocs which are comparable to real wastewater treatment scenario because low concentration rocs may be adsorbed by the sludge we performed long term reactor operation to confirm the occurrence of biodegradation three sequencing batch reactors were operated to treat different wastewaters containing gbp bpaf and bpa respectively the seeding sludge was taken out from the containers operated under starvation condition on day 3 and day 43 the initial concentrations of gbp bpaf and bpa in the influent were 10 μg l and the concentration of the seeding sludge was 2500 mg l the effective volume of the sequencing batch reactor was 2 l and the exchange volume was 50 each cycle of the batch reactors contained four steps of filling 5 min aeration 98 min settling 15 min and decantation 2 min the effluent was collected during the settling process of each cycle every 2 h and the concentrations of rocs were measured 2 3 functional bacteria separated by mmi in this study the bacteria involved in roc degradation were investigated by mmi approach the synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles mnps was performed according to the instructions in a previous study zhang et al 2015 the detailed procedures were described in text s1 to isolate the functional bacteria 50 ml of activated sludge was collected from the aerobic starvation treatment system and centrifuged at 3000 xg for 10 min the sludge pellets were added to 50 ml mnp solution which was mixed completely and shaken at 150 rpm for 20 min at room temperature then the mnp functionalized bacteria were separated from the solution by a permanent magnet the harvested bacterial cell pellets were further washed three times with sterilized water and resuspended in 100 ml of medium the medium contains 10 mg l roc bpaf gbp or bpa as the sole carbon source as well as the nutrients mentioned above the medium with functionalized bacteria was incubated for three days under room temperature during this process the active bacteria involved in roc degradation would lose their magnetic nanoparticles we then used a magnet to separate the inactive bacteria with magnetic nanoparticles finally the bacteria in liquid phase were collected by filtration with 0 22 μm filters and used for dna extraction 2 4 roc concentration analysis prior to the roc analysis all water samples were filtered through 0 22 μm glass fiber filters for high concentration rocs analysis a high

details about the solid phase extraction were described in text s3 2 5 total organic carbon toc and sludge concentration analysis to explore whether starved sludge can completely remove the organic pollutants the toc concentrations of the water samples were measured prior to the toc analysis all water samples were filtered through 0 22 μm glass fiber filters the toc concentration of each water sample was measured by a toc analyzer toc l cph shimadzu kyoto japan the sludge concentration was determined by measuring volatile suspended solids vss according to the standard method 2 6 dna and rna extraction the dna of each sludge sample was extracted using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals solon oh usa following the manufacturer s protocol the purity and concentration of the extracted dna were determined using a nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific wilmington de usa and confirmed by agarose gel 1 electrophoresis the extracted dna was stored at 20 c the total rna was extracted from each sludge sample taken on day 0 day 3 and day 43 with the transzol up plus rna kit transgen biotech beijing china all reagents and instrument were kept on ice to minimize rna degradation the purity and concentration of the extracted rna were determined using a nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific wilmington de usa and confirmed by agarose gel 1 electrophoresis the extracted rna was stored at 80 c 2 7 16s rrna gene sequencing to analyze the bacterial community in the sludge samples the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified with the pcr primers 515f 5 gtg cca gcm gcc gcg gtaa 3 and 806r 5 gga cta chv ggg twt cta at 3 targeting the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene the pcr amplification was performed in a total volume of 20 μl containing

the low quality reads were removed using the quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime toolkit caporaso et al 2011 after that the sequencing data were rarefied at 30 000 sequences per sample then operation taxonomic units otu were obtained by clustering the sequences at 97 nucleotide similarity level the alpha diversity indices were also calculated by qiime the raw metagenomic reads were processed by using trimmomatic bolger et al 2014 to remove low quality reads and trim adapters the reads passed quality control in each sample were then assembled into contigs using megahit li et al 2015 next the quality controlled reads were mapped to the assembled contigs using bbmap v 38 26 https sourceforge net projects bbmap to generate a coverage score for each contig then the metagenome assembled genomes mags were recovered from each sample using metabat2 kang et al 2019 the completeness and contamination of the mags were estimated using checkm parks et al 2015 with lineage specific marker genes the taxonomy of each mag was annotated using gtdb tk based on the genome taxonomy database parks et al 2018 according to the annotated mag species information the corresponding genomes from ncbi were retrieved and fastani goris et al 2007 were used to calculate the average nucleotide identity ani between the retrieved genomes and the mags obtained in this study the metatranscriptomic sequencing reads were compared against the bacterial genomes by using bbmap to investigate the bacterial activity in addition prodigal hyatt et al 2010 was used to predict the functional genes in the mags to obtain the open reading frames orfs protein sequences translated from the orfs were annotated with the aromadeg databases duarte et al 2014 using blastp wilcoxon signed rank test was performed by using r software to determine the orfs whose relative abundance were significantly different among different samples 3 results 3 1 aerobic starvation improves roc degradation ability of activated sludge in this study we investigated the roc degradation ability of activated sludge under aerobic starvation condition during the starvation process activated sludge was periodically taken from the reactor and batch experiments were carried out to determine the roc degradation rates the results fig 1 showed that after the aerobic starvation treatment the degradation efficiencies of bpaf gbp and bpa were significantly enhanced in fig 1a b d and e the degradation rates of bpaf and gbp in the seeding activated sludge without starvation control experiment day 0 were in the range of 3 9 to 4 5 mg g vss h in contrast after the sludge was starved under aerobic conditions for two days the maximum degradation rates of gbp and bpaf increased to 8 9 and 11 4 mg g vss h respectively however the high degradation ability of the starved activated sludge did not last long as the starvation treatment continued the degradability of starved sludge on bpaf and gbp gradually decreased since day 3 and the degradation rates of bpaf and gbp were only 3 7 and 4 9 mg g vss h on day 4 respectively fig 1d and e compared with bpaf and gbp the degradation ability of activated sludge on bpa changed little during the first several days of starvation as shown in fig 1c and f the initial degradation rate of bpa was almost zero after the aerobic starvation treatment batch experiment results showed that the degradation ability of activated sludge slowly increased on day 28 the degradation rate increased to 0 2 mg g vss h and 0 8 mg g vss h was achieved on day 43 stasinakis et al 2010 reported that bpa is very difficult to be biodegraded with a removal efficiency in activated sludge of less than 40 and only a few bpa degrading bacterial species which are affiliated with sphingobium novosphingobium sphingopyxis etc have been reported to have a relatively higher degradation rate 1 46 mg g vss h oh and choi 2019 which compares with the results of this study toc analysis showed that all the three rocs could be completely mineralized fig s1 to investigate the effects of sludge adsorption on the removal of rocs we also conducted degradation experiments using the sterilized starved sludge as shown in fig s2 the percentage of rocs removed by adsorption was less than 20 which was much less than that removed by the biodegradation fig 1 the above results suggested the removal of the roc was mainly contributed by the mineralization ability of the starved sludge in addition we also investigated the degradation performance of the starved sludge on wastewater containing low concentration rocs 10 μg l as shown in fig s3 the removal efficiencies of the three rocs were also relatively high about 90 and the values were significantly higher than that of regular activated sludge 60 80 3 2 impact of aerobic starvation on the microbial community of activated sludge aerobic starvation will inevitably change the microbial community of activated sludge liu et al 2017 thus we investigated the microbial community shift during the aerobic starvation process by high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna gene fig 2 a shows the clustering analysis results where samples taken on days 1 30 day 36 and day 43 were clustered into three different groups indicating that the bacterial community composition generally remained stable in the initial 30 days and changed significantly on day 36 and day 43 fig 2b shows that the alpha diversity of the microbial community also remained stable in the first 30 days and began to significantly decrease afterwards the shannon index decreased to 9 4 and 8 6 on day 36 and day 43 respectively during this process it was inferred that only a limited number of bacterial species could survive by consuming the bacterial residues quaiyum et al 2020 fig 2c shows the abundance of proteobacteria dropped from 41 3 on day 36 to 20 6 on day 43 and the relative abundances of bacteroidetes and actinobacteria increased from 21 4 and 4 2 to 33 5 and 12 1 respectively this indicates that although proteobacteria dominated in the activated sludge most 50 could not survive by consuming bacterial residues by analyzing the main otus fig 2d we found that the relative abundance of the dominant bacterial species did not significantly change until days 18 24 after day 18 the relative abundance of a variety bacteria mainly affiliated with sphingomonadaceae chitinophagaceae neisseriaceae xanthomonadaceae cytophagaceae pirellulaceae thermomonas lactobacillus and spirobacillale significantly increased confirming that a relatively long aerobic starvation time can change the microbial composition of activated sludge conversely this suggests that the increase of the degradation efficiency of bpaf and gbp may not relate to the variation of the bacterial community while the enhancement of the degradation of bpa may be caused by the enrichment of certain microorganisms the enrichment of sphingomonadaceae in starved sludge was consistent with a previous studies oh and choi 2019 which reported that species in sphingomonadaceae have a very strong bpa degradation ability 3 3 mmi analysis of roc degrading bacteria and their changes during aerobic starvation to investigate the shift of the microbial community during the aerobic starvation and the bacterial cohort involved in different roc degradations we performed mmi analysis and explored bacterial community variations during the starvation process fig 3 a shows an observable change in the microbial community structures of the sludge after mmi treatment compared to the original activated sludge fig 3b also indicates that the alpha diversity dropped significantly we selected the otus with significant differences in the samples before and after mmi treatment and we defined the otus with relative abundance differences greater than 1 as the roc degrading bacteria chen et al 2021 fig 3c shows the bacteria affiliated with sphingomonadaceae 29 3 dominated in the bpaf enriched sludge after mmi treatment followed by comamonadaceae 12 1 pseudomonadaceae 8 2 and rhizobiaceae 6 6 it has been reported that species of sphingomonadaceae comamonadaceae and pseudomonadaceae can degrade bisphenols in previous studies conejo saucedo et al 2021 mita et al 2015 takeo et al 2020 in the gbp enriched sludge the dominant bacteria included comamonadaceae 28 3 cytophagaceae 5 2 nannocystaceae 6 4 and saprospiraceae 6 1 among them the degradation ability of comamonadaceae and cytophagaceae has been reported kim et al 2017 sphingomonadaceae were the most abundant bacteria in bpa enriched sludge and the relative abundance accounted for approximately 80 of all the bacteria other major bacteria included cytophagaceae rhizobiaceae alcaligenaceae etc at the otu level the bacterial communities in different groups are also clearly different as shown in fig 3d sphingomonas species were abundantly present in both bpaf and bpa enriched sludge besides pseudomonas bosea and methylibium were also involved in the bpaf degradation and achromobacter could be the important contributor of bpa degradation for gbp kinneretia cytophagaceae and saprospiraceae were significantly enriched during mmi treatment implying that bacteria associated with these three genera might play an important role in gbp degradation variations in the abundance of the roc degrading bacteria during the starvation sludge were analyzed and are summarized in fig 3e we found that the relative abundance of roc degrading bacteria did not change significantly during the early period of aerobic starvation treatment however it significantly increased on day 43 from approximately 8 to 20 cytophagaceae were the main members of the enriched bacterial community and their abundance accounts for about 16 for specific rocs as shown in fig s4 the relative abundance of bpaf and gbp degrading bacteria did not increase significantly during the aerobic starvation process the bpa degrading bacteria also generally remained stable approximately 2 in the early stage but significantly increased to about 16 on day 43 3 4 impact of aerobic starvation on the gene expression of roc degrading bacteria through the above 16s rrna gene sequencing data analysis it was found that the bacterial community did not significantly change during the initial period of aerobic starvation treatment the bpa degrading bacteria were observed proliferating on day 43 which coincides with the increase of the bpa degradation efficiency however the degradation efficiency of bpaf and gbp both increased and decreased substantially between day 1 and day 4 fig 1 and no significant bacterial community changes occurred during this process therefore it was inferred that the increased bpaf and gbp degradation efficiency might relate to the expression of corresponding genes metatranscriptomic sequencing was performed on samples taken from different periods day 0 day 3 and day 43 to investigate the expressions of the aromatic compound degradation genes the compositions of pathways of significantly differentially expressed genes on day 3 and day 43 were shown in fig s5 it was found that the sequences assigned to metabolism pathways significantly increased on both day3 and day43 with abundances of 65 17 and 49 19 respectively fig 4 a and b show the up or down regulated genes wilcoxon test p 0 05 on day 3 1509 genes were up regulated and 506 genes were down regulated compared to day 0 on day 43 the number of up regulated genes was 1189 and the number of down regulated genes was 445 the higher number of up regulated genes related to aromatic compound degradation suggested that some functions of the bacterial community might be enhanced during the aerobic starvation treatment process based on the aromadeg database duarte et al 2014 we analyzed the up regulated aromatic compound degradation genes in the aerobic starvation sludge of day 3 and day 43 and their abundances were shown in fig 4c and d the relative abundances of these gene transcripts in starved sludge day 3 and day 43 were obviously higher than those in the seeding sludge and the mean difference was close to 1 8 suggesting an increase in the expression of these aromatic compound degradation genes according to the classification in the aromadeg database the up regulated aromatic compound degradation genes were further clustered into 9 clusters i e salicylate phthalate ligb protocatechuate ligb protocatechuate gentisate exd monocyclic substrates exdo miscellaneous exdo bicyclic substrates and benzoate with different functions fig 4e and f among them in both day 3 and day 43 samples phthalate is the dominant cluster followed by ligb homoprotocatechuate and benzoate although gbp is not aromatic compound its degradation also related to the increase of aromatic compound degradation genes suggesting that some aromatic compound degradation genes may also be responsible for the degradation of other refractory organic compounds duarte et al 2014 we also tried to recover mags table s2 from the metagenomic data by assembling and binning to investigate the bacterial functions the ani calculation results showed that the ani values between the mags and the species in the database are relatively high fig 5 a which indicates that the mags are similar to known species and further confirms the taxonomy annotation results according to the taxonomic annotation results and the roc degrading bacteria identified by mmi fig 3d three mags affiliated with sphingomonadaceae were potential bpaf degrading bacteria five mags affiliated with rhizobiaceae and saprospiraceae were potential gbp degrading bacteria and six mags affiliated with sphingomonadaceae and rhizobiaceae were potential bpa degrading bacteria in order to analyze the activity of these roc degrading bacteria during the aerobic starvation treatment process we mapped the metatranscriptomic data to the mags to obtain the gene coverage as shown in fig 5b the coverages of the day 3 samples average 0 16 on sphingomonadaceae were significantly higher than those of the day 0 samples average 0 08 similarly the coverages of the day 3 samples on the gbp degrading bacteria saprospiraceae average 0 05 were also higher than those of the day 0 samples average 0 01 for bpa degrading bacteria sphingomonadaceae and rhizobiaceae had significantly higher coverages in the day 43 samples to further confirm the degradation ability of these bacteria the protein sequences predicted from the mags were compared with the aromadeg database four mags affiliated with sphingomonas agrobacterium blastomonas and sphingopyxis were found to carry aromatic degradation genes as shown in fig 5d in total four aromatic degradation genes were identified from the four mags and all of them are the dioxygenase gene furthermore the metatranscriptomic data of day 0 day 3 and day 43 were mapped to these four mags and fig 5c shows the relative abundance of degradation gene expression in sphingomonas blastomonas and sphingopyxis which gradually increased in the starvation process meanwhile the degradation gene expression in agrobacterium in the day 3 samples was relatively higher 4 discussion in this study we found that the degradation efficiencies of bpaf gbp and bpa were significantly enhanced after the aerobic starvation treatment the maximum degradation efficiencies of gbp and bpaf were observed on the second day of the aerobic starvation treatment after which they declined rapidly the reason could be that the seeding sludge contains a certain proportion of bacteria capable of degrading bpaf and gbp but these bacteria can also live on other carbon sources a variety of organic matters including adsorbed organic matters guellil et al 2001 and extracellular polymer substances sponza 2003 are present in activated sludge and can be used as carbon sources by microorganisms zhang et al 2014 for example the acinetobacter species able to metabolize both acetate and phenolic compounds were reported in one of our previous studies sun et al 2019a therefore when the easily degradable organic matters in the bioreactor were depleted bpaf and gbp can be utilized as carbon sources by the corresponding degrading bacteria this inference was confirmed by the microbial community analysis and metatranscriptomic analysis the results showed that the microbial community did not significantly change but the genes related to aromatic compound degradation were up regulated during the early stage of the aerobic starvation treatment however the maximum degradation efficiency of bpa was different from those of gbp and bpaf and occurred on the 43rd day the microbial community analysis and mmi analysis showed that the relative abundance of bpa degrading bacteria sphingomonas achromobacter etc significantly increased in the later period of the starvation treatment this suggests that these bpa degrading bacteria are less abundant in the seeding sludge and can be enriched during the aerobic starvation treatment previous studies have shown that the abundance of sphingomonas and achromobacter is usually lower than 0 1 in municipal wastewater treatment plants wu et al 2019 which was generally comparable with the seeding sludge used in this study it s worth noting that the increase of the relative abundance of these bacteria could also be potentially resulted from the decrease of some other bacteria therefore further studies are still needed to explore the detailed microbial community changes during the starvation process through monitoring the changes in the microbial community structure of the activated sludge during the aerobic starvation process it was found that the bacterial community composition generally remained stable in the initial 30 days and changed significantly after 36 days this trend of the microbial community change was seldom reported in previous literature but was not unexpected it is well known the organic matters and other nutrients are important factors for microorganisms and nutrient depletion could affect the structure of the microbial community in activated sludge wang et al 2020 however the time required for this change to occur could be relatively long under aerobic starvation condition one reason could be that the dna of some dead bacteria are protected by the cell wall nagata 2005 leading to a relatively long time for dna degradation besides some bacteria may survive under the aerobic condition and most bacteria that utilize bacterial residues to survive might be oligotrophic bacteria and their growth rates were usually slow gray et al 2019 therefore it takes a long time for the composition of the microbial community to change significantly during the aerobic starvation process during this process only a limited number of bacterial species could survive by using the bacterial residues quaiyum et al 2020 some survival bacteria such as sphingomonas and cytophagaceae could degrade bpa leading to the increase of bpa degradation after a long aerobic starvation treatment after investigating the bacteria community and the specific bacteria abundance variations during aerobic starvation process it was found that the relative abundance of the bpa degrading bacteria did not change significantly during the initial period of aerobic starvation treatment but it increased significantly on day 43 and the members of cytophagaceae were the main bpa degrading bacteria in a previous study cydzik kwiatkowska and zielińska 2018 reported that the cytophaga species affiliated with cytophagaceae have the ability to degrade bpa it was also reported that cytophagaceae are capable of dissolving cells and degrading cellulose bernardet et al 2002 which is probably why they can survive by consuming dead microorganisms during the aerobic starvation process traditionally roc degrading bacteria were cultivated with wastewater containing specific pollutants for example the bpa degrading bacteria were obtained by this way in the previous studies gray et al 2019 although it took over 30 days to enrich the bpa degrading bacterial consortium the time is still shorter or comparable to the traditional cultivation method sathyamoorthy et al 2018 in addition compared with the traditional method the operation of the aerobic starvation is much easier and the cost is lower therefore this may provide a new approach for enrichment of roc degrading bacteria during the aerobic starvation process the expression of aromatic degradation genes was found to be up regulated according to previous studies phthalate and benzoate are important intermediate products in the degradation process of bpaf yang et al 2019 gbp henning et al 2018 and bpa zhang et al 2013 and the benzoate 1 2 dioxygenase could transform benzoate into cis 1 6 dihydroxy 2 4 cyclohexadiene 1 carboxylic acid within the benzoate to catechol degradation pathway haddad et al 2001 the phthalate 4 5 dioxygenase enzyme can catalyze the conversion of phthalate to protocatechuate bourguignon et al 2016 the homoprotocatechuate 2 3 dioxygenase of the ligb superfamily roper and cooper 1990 can further metabolize the homoprotocatechuate ring cleavage product via the meta cleavage pathway during the aerobic starvation process the expression of the genes encoding these proteins increased which explained the increased degradation efficiency of bpaf gbp and bpa moreover these genes were also carried by the mags recovered from the metagenomes for example bin12 blastomonas and bin30 sphingopyxis carried 1 2 dioxygenase genes and the 4 5 dioxygenase gene was found in bin10 sphingomonas and bin11 agrobacterium the 2 3 dioxygenase gene was in bins 10 12 and 30 this further confirmed the presence of roc degrading bacteria in the aerobic starvation treated sludge the increase of bpa degradation gene expression is related to the abundance of degrading bacteria while bpaf and gbp are related to the activity of degrading bacteria several previous studies have reported the co metabolism can improve the removal efficiency of rocs through the synergistic effect nsenga kumwimba and meng 2019 however it was also reported that when multiple organic substances are present the degradation of different substances may interfere with each other reardon et al 2000 the results of this study from the perspective of metabolic competition suggest that after the organic matters in the sludge is consumed by the aerobic starvation and the expression of roc such as bpaf and gbp degradation genes in the sludge could be increased to promote the degradation of these substances the three compounds bpa bpaf and gbp investigated in this study are frequently detected organic micropollutants omps in wastewater petrie et al 2015 potential omp risks to aquatic environments and human health have caused researchers to find ways to remove these organics from wastewater martínez alcalá et al 2021 however low concentration μg l or lower and degradation resistance has hindered the implementation of removing omps from wastewater the findings of this study provide a potentially novel strategy to develop and design omp removal technologies and processes by utilizing the residual sludge generated from the regular biological treatment processes of wwtps for example an additional bioreactor could be set to perform the starvation and the starved sludge can be used to remove omps or low concentration refractory organic matters from the effluent of regular biological processes in addition to removing complex organic matters reduction of sludge can also be achieved by taking advantage of the aerobic starvation process nevertheless although bpa bpaf and gbp could be efficiently degraded by starved sludge we also noticed that the removal efficiency of some other refractory compounds e g ibu and dcf was not significantly enhanced fig s6 one possible reason could be that the degrading bacteria of these compounds were eliminated under the starvation conditions it s also possible that the degrading bacteria do not present in the activated sludge used in this study therefore further studies are required to investigate the detailed mechanisms of the aerobic starvation and the degradation process of organic matters especially low concentration complex organic matters improvements on the microbial community selection during the aerobic starvation process are expected to make this approach applicable to remove more complex organics from wastewater 5 conclusions in this study we found that aerobic starvation treatment can significantly improve the degradation efficiencies of some rocs in activated sludge systems the highest degradation rates of bpaf 11 4 mg g vss h and gbp 8 9 mg g vss h were achieved on the second day of the starvation process while the degradation rate of bpa on the 43rd day reached the maximum value of 0 8 mg g vss h based on mmi 16s rrna gene sequencing metagenomic sequencing and metatranscriptomic sequencing studies it was found that the mechanisms of degradation efficiency changes under starvation conditions of different rocs are different the increase of the expression of some roc degrading genes in starved sludge enhances the degradation of bpaf and gbp and the increase of relative abundance of bpa degrading bacteria sphingomonas achromobacter etc under starvation conditions leads to the increase of bpa degradation

15520,many refractory organic compounds rocs in wastewater are toxic to human and aquatic organisms here we reported an aerobic starvation approach to improve the degradation efficiencies of rocs in activated sludge systems the highest degradation rates of bisphenol af bpaf 11 4 mg g vss h and gabapentin gbp 8 9 mg g vss h were achieved on the second day of the starvation process while the degradation rate of bisphenol a bpa on the 43rd day reached the maximum value of 0 8 mg g vss h which was significantly higher than that of the seeding sludge 0 01 mg g vss h to investigate the mechanisms of this finding we applied magnetic nanoparticle mediated isolation 16s rrna gene sequencing metagenomic sequencing and metatranscriptomic sequencing to analyze the microbial community structures and functions during the starvation process the results showed that the increase of the bpa degradation ability was caused by the increase of the relative abundance of bpa degrading bacteria sphingomonas achromobacter etc while the enhancement of bpaf and gbp degradation was attributed to the increase of the expression of roc degrading genes overall these results improve our understanding of the microbial ecology of starved activated sludge and provide useful information for the future development of roc removal technologies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords refractory organic compounds activated sludge metagenomic sequencing metatranscriptomic sequencing data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction refractory organic compounds rocs are widely present in various water environments such as wastewater surface water and even drinking water at different concentrations pan et al 2016 petrie et al 2015 and have attracted widespread attention due to their potential risks these rocs mainly include pharmaceuticals personal care products industrial materials and other toxic chemicals discharged from factories and households liu and wong 2013 although discharged wastewater containing rocs is treated in wastewater treatment plants wwtps many rocs cannot be completely removed and are discharged into natural environments through the effluent liu and wong 2013 despite the roc presence in the environment their concentrations are usually relatively low nevertheless their toxicity and potential risks to human health and aquatic organisms cannot be ignored petrie et al 2015 therefore it is of great significance to develop effective treatment technologies to remove harmful rocs from wastewater it is well known that most rocs do not always respond to biodegradation by microorganisms some of which are highly toxic to microorganisms petrie et al 2015 although studies have shown that physical and chemical processes such as activated carbon adsorption powdered activated carbon ultrafiltration hybrid process ozone biofiltration and fenton process can remove rocs from wastewater with relatively good removal efficiencies biological methods are still highly attractive when considering the operating cost and operational complexity ahmed et al 2021 to overcome the low biodegradation efficiency of rocs biological acclimation and bioaugmentation have been proposed and used into practice by many researchers and engineers cheng et al 2021 by applying these approaches certain functional microorganisms which are capable of removing the pollutants can proliferate and dominate in the biological treatment processes pure culture bacteria with high efficiency roc degradation abilities have been isolated from various environments low et al 2019 however it is difficult to implement bioaugmentation in engineering practice due to the low adaptability of pure culture exogenous bacteria in wastewater treatment bioreactors nzila et al 2016 compared with pure culture bacteria the applications of mixed culture and indigenous bacteria are more practical and diverse bacteria in a mixed system can promote the degradation of organic compounds through synergistic effects el fantroussi and agathos 2005 for example the mixed culture of ammonia oxidizing and heterotrophic bacteria has been proven capable of enhancing the removal of complex organics sun et al 2019b the conventional approach to obtain cultures with high roc degradation abilities is to acclimate the microbial community of the seeding activated sludge or other inoculum to specific rocs by enhancing biodegradation efficiency with an improved resistance to a high loading or loading shock kamali et al 2019 traditional startup processes of activated sludge reactors are based on this acclimation method and are widely used in research and engineering practices boonnorat et al 2021 however this approach is dependent of wastewater with high concentrations of specific rocs kamali et al 2019 in addition the acclimatization process could be long with a possibility of failure inaba et al 2020 a previous study showed that aerobic starvation treatment could significantly change the microbial community of activated sludge and some bacterial species were enriched during the starvation process liu et al 2017 besides some other studies showed that starvation may affect the nitrifying microorganisms in biological wastewater treatment systems elawwad et al 2013 torà et al 2010 however little is known about the organic matter degradation ability of the starved sludge in this study we found that aerobic starvation treatment can improve the degradation ability of activated sludge on some rocs to investigate the mechanisms we explored the microbial community shift during the aerobic starvation based on 16s rrna gene sequencing we also identified possible bacteria involved in the roc degradation process based on magnetic nanoparticle mediated isolation mmi zhang et al 2015 compared dna stable isotope probing method the mmi method does not require specific stable isotope 13c or 15n labelled substrates and has been successfully used to analyze the functional bacteria wang et al 2016 furthermore by using metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing the key bacterial functions and the functional gene expression profiles during the aerobic starvation process were also systematically analyzed based on these findings we revealed the reasons of the increased degradation ability and proposed potential applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 aerobic starvation treatment of sludge the activated sludge used for starvation treatment was collected from the aeration tank of a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp where anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2o process is applied the activated sludge was put in a 10 l glass container and continuous aeration was performed to maintain the dissolved oxygen concentration above 2 mg l and a total of three replicate experiments were conducted the starvation process lasted for 68 days and no nutrients were added during this process sludge samples were collected every day at the initial period and every several days after day 4 to analyze the degradation ability of different rocs including gabapentin gbp bisphenol a bpa bisphenol af bpaf diclofenac dcf and ibuprofen ibu in addition the activated sludge samples were also collected from the 10 l glass container regularly for subsequent dna and rna extraction the activated sludge directly collected from the aeration tank of the same wwtp regular activated sludge was used as control without starvation to analyze the roc degradation ability 2 2 roc degradation analysis for roc degradation the sludge samples were first centrifuged at 3000 xg for 10 min then the supernatant was discarded and the sludge was washed three times with 1xpbs solution to investigate the effect of adsorption control experiment with sterilized sludge was also carried out the roc degradation analysis was performed in 250 ml glass containers for each sludge the degradation analysis was conducted in triplicate the initial roc gbp bpaf bpa dcf and ibu concentration in the artificial wastewater was 10 mg l other nutrients include 76 mg l of nh4cl 100 mg l of mgso4 7h2o 30 mg l of cacl2 2h2o 17 mg l of kh2po4 80 mg l of feso4 7h2o 100 μg l of mncl2 4h2o 20 μg l of namoo4 2h2o 10 μg l of cuso4 5h2o 2 μg l of cocl2 6h2o and 50 μg l of znso4 7h2o in order to minimize the impact of adsorption the sludge concentration was maintained at 100 mg l in addition we also investigated the degradation efficiency of starved sludge on low concentration rocs which are comparable to real wastewater treatment scenario because low concentration rocs may be adsorbed by the sludge we performed long term reactor operation to confirm the occurrence of biodegradation three sequencing batch reactors were operated to treat different wastewaters containing gbp bpaf and bpa respectively the seeding sludge was taken out from the containers operated under starvation condition on day 3 and day 43 the initial concentrations of gbp bpaf and bpa in the influent were 10 μg l and the concentration of the seeding sludge was 2500 mg l the effective volume of the sequencing batch reactor was 2 l and the exchange volume was 50 each cycle of the batch reactors contained four steps of filling 5 min aeration 98 min settling 15 min and decantation 2 min the effluent was collected during the settling process of each cycle every 2 h and the concentrations of rocs were measured 2 3 functional bacteria separated by mmi in this study the bacteria involved in roc degradation were investigated by mmi approach the synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles mnps was performed according to the instructions in a previous study zhang et al 2015 the detailed procedures were described in text s1 to isolate the functional bacteria 50 ml of activated sludge was collected from the aerobic starvation treatment system and centrifuged at 3000 xg for 10 min the sludge pellets were added to 50 ml mnp solution which was mixed completely and shaken at 150 rpm for 20 min at room temperature then the mnp functionalized bacteria were separated from the solution by a permanent magnet the harvested bacterial cell pellets were further washed three times with sterilized water and resuspended in 100 ml of medium the medium contains 10 mg l roc bpaf gbp or bpa as the sole carbon source as well as the nutrients mentioned above the medium with functionalized bacteria was incubated for three days under room temperature during this process the active bacteria involved in roc degradation would lose their magnetic nanoparticles we then used a magnet to separate the inactive bacteria with magnetic nanoparticles finally the bacteria in liquid phase were collected by filtration with 0 22 μm filters and used for dna extraction 2 4 roc concentration analysis prior to the roc analysis all water samples were filtered through 0 22 μm glass fiber filters for high concentration rocs analysis a high

pollutants the toc concentrations of the water samples were measured prior to the toc analysis all water samples were filtered through 0 22 μm glass fiber filters the toc concentration of each water sample was measured by a toc analyzer toc l cph shimadzu kyoto japan the sludge concentration was determined by measuring volatile suspended solids vss according to the standard method 2 6 dna and rna extraction the dna of each sludge sample was extracted using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals solon oh usa following the manufacturer s protocol the purity and concentration of the extracted dna were determined using a nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific wilmington de usa and confirmed by agarose gel 1 electrophoresis the extracted dna was stored at 20 c the total rna was extracted from each sludge sample taken on day 0 day 3 and day 43 with the transzol up plus rna kit transgen biotech beijing china all reagents and instrument were kept on ice to minimize rna degradation the purity and concentration of the extracted rna were determined using a nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific wilmington de usa and confirmed by agarose gel 1 electrophoresis the extracted rna was stored at 80 c 2 7 16s rrna gene sequencing to analyze the bacterial community in the sludge samples the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified with the pcr primers 515f 5 gtg cca gcm gcc gcg gtaa 3 and 806r 5 gga cta chv ggg twt cta at 3 targeting the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene the pcr amplification was performed in a total volume of 20 μl containing

the low quality reads were removed using the quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime toolkit caporaso et al 2011 after that the sequencing data were rarefied at 30 000 sequences per sample then operation taxonomic units otu were obtained by clustering the sequences at 97 nucleotide similarity level the alpha diversity indices were also calculated by qiime the raw metagenomic reads were processed by using trimmomatic bolger et al 2014 to remove low quality reads and trim adapters the reads passed quality control in each sample were then assembled into contigs using megahit li et al 2015 next the quality controlled reads were mapped to the assembled contigs using bbmap v 38 26 https sourceforge net projects bbmap to generate a coverage score for each contig then the metagenome assembled genomes mags were recovered from each sample using metabat2 kang et al 2019 the completeness and contamination of the mags were estimated using checkm parks et al 2015 with lineage specific marker genes the taxonomy of each mag was annotated using gtdb tk based on the genome taxonomy database parks et al 2018 according to the annotated mag species information the corresponding genomes from ncbi were retrieved and fastani goris et al 2007 were used to calculate the average nucleotide identity ani between the retrieved genomes and the mags obtained in this study the metatranscriptomic sequencing reads were compared against the bacterial genomes by using bbmap to investigate the bacterial activity in addition prodigal hyatt et al 2010 was used to predict the functional genes in the mags to obtain the open reading frames orfs protein sequences translated from the orfs were annotated with the aromadeg databases duarte et al 2014 using blastp wilcoxon signed rank test was performed by using r software to determine the orfs whose relative abundance were significantly different among different samples 3 results 3 1 aerobic starvation improves roc degradation ability of activated sludge in this study we investigated the roc degradation ability of activated sludge under aerobic starvation condition during the starvation process activated sludge was periodically taken from the reactor and batch experiments were carried out to determine the roc degradation rates the results fig 1 showed that after the aerobic starvation treatment the degradation efficiencies of bpaf gbp and bpa were significantly enhanced in fig 1a b d and e the degradation rates of bpaf and gbp in the seeding activated sludge without starvation control experiment day 0 were in the range of 3 9 to 4 5 mg g vss h in contrast after the sludge was starved under aerobic conditions for two days the maximum degradation rates of gbp and bpaf increased to 8 9 and 11 4 mg g vss h respectively however the high degradation ability of the starved activated sludge did not last long as the starvation treatment continued the degradability of starved sludge on bpaf and gbp gradually decreased since day 3 and the degradation rates of bpaf and gbp were only 3 7 and 4 9 mg g vss h on day 4 respectively fig 1d and e compared with bpaf and gbp the degradation ability of activated sludge on bpa changed little during the first several days of starvation as shown in fig 1c and f the initial degradation rate of bpa was almost zero after the aerobic starvation treatment batch experiment results showed that the degradation ability of activated sludge slowly increased on day 28 the degradation rate increased to 0 2 mg g vss h and 0 8 mg g vss h was achieved on day 43 stasinakis et al 2010 reported that bpa is very difficult to be biodegraded with a removal efficiency in activated sludge of less than 40 and only a few bpa degrading bacterial species which are affiliated with sphingobium novosphingobium sphingopyxis etc have been reported to have a relatively higher degradation rate 1 46 mg g vss h oh and choi 2019 which compares with the results of this study toc analysis showed that all the three rocs could be completely mineralized fig s1 to investigate the effects of sludge adsorption on the removal of rocs we also conducted degradation experiments using the sterilized starved sludge as shown in fig s2 the percentage of rocs removed by adsorption was less than 20 which was much less than that removed by the biodegradation fig 1 the above results suggested the removal of the roc was mainly contributed by the mineralization ability of the starved sludge in addition we also investigated the degradation performance of the starved sludge on wastewater containing low concentration rocs 10 μg l as shown in fig s3 the removal efficiencies of the three rocs were also relatively high about 90 and the values were significantly higher than that of regular activated sludge 60 80 3 2 impact of aerobic starvation on the microbial community of activated sludge aerobic starvation will inevitably change the microbial community of activated sludge liu et al 2017 thus we investigated the microbial community shift during the aerobic starvation process by high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna gene fig 2 a shows the clustering analysis results where samples taken on days 1 30 day 36 and day 43 were clustered into three different groups indicating that the bacterial community composition generally remained stable in the initial 30 days and changed significantly on day 36 and day 43 fig 2b shows that the alpha diversity of the microbial community also remained stable in the first 30 days and began to significantly decrease afterwards the shannon index decreased to 9 4 and 8 6 on day 36 and day 43 respectively during this process it was inferred that only a limited number of bacterial species could survive by consuming the bacterial residues quaiyum et al 2020 fig 2c shows the abundance of proteobacteria dropped from 41 3 on day 36 to 20 6 on day 43 and the relative abundances of bacteroidetes and actinobacteria increased from 21 4 and 4 2 to 33 5 and 12 1 respectively this indicates that although proteobacteria dominated in the activated sludge most 50 could not survive by consuming bacterial residues by analyzing the main otus fig 2d we found that the relative abundance of the dominant bacterial species did not significantly change until days 18 24 after day 18 the relative abundance of a variety bacteria mainly affiliated with sphingomonadaceae chitinophagaceae neisseriaceae xanthomonadaceae cytophagaceae pirellulaceae thermomonas lactobacillus and spirobacillale significantly increased confirming that a relatively long aerobic starvation time can change the microbial composition of activated sludge conversely this suggests that the increase of the degradation efficiency of bpaf and gbp may not relate to the variation of the bacterial community while the enhancement of the degradation of bpa may be caused by the enrichment of certain microorganisms the enrichment of sphingomonadaceae in starved sludge was consistent with a previous studies oh and choi 2019 which reported that species in sphingomonadaceae have a very strong bpa degradation ability 3 3 mmi analysis of roc degrading bacteria and their changes during aerobic starvation to investigate the shift of the microbial community during the aerobic starvation and the bacterial cohort involved in different roc degradations we performed mmi analysis and explored bacterial community variations during the starvation process fig 3 a shows an observable change in the microbial community structures of the sludge after mmi treatment compared to the original activated sludge fig 3b also indicates that the alpha diversity dropped significantly we selected the otus with significant differences in the samples before and after mmi treatment and we defined the otus with relative abundance differences greater than 1 as the roc degrading bacteria chen et al 2021 fig 3c shows the bacteria affiliated with sphingomonadaceae 29 3 dominated in the bpaf enriched sludge after mmi treatment followed by comamonadaceae 12 1 pseudomonadaceae 8 2 and rhizobiaceae 6 6 it has been reported that species of sphingomonadaceae comamonadaceae and pseudomonadaceae can degrade bisphenols in previous studies conejo saucedo et al 2021 mita et al 2015 takeo et al 2020 in the gbp enriched sludge the dominant bacteria included comamonadaceae 28 3 cytophagaceae 5 2 nannocystaceae 6 4 and saprospiraceae 6 1 among them the degradation ability of comamonadaceae and cytophagaceae has been reported kim et al 2017 sphingomonadaceae were the most abundant bacteria in bpa enriched sludge and the relative abundance accounted for approximately 80 of all the bacteria other major bacteria included cytophagaceae rhizobiaceae alcaligenaceae etc at the otu level the bacterial communities in different groups are also clearly different as shown in fig 3d sphingomonas species were abundantly present in both bpaf and bpa enriched sludge besides pseudomonas bosea and methylibium were also involved in the bpaf degradation and achromobacter could be the important contributor of bpa degradation for gbp kinneretia cytophagaceae and saprospiraceae were significantly enriched during mmi treatment implying that bacteria associated with these three genera might play an important role in gbp degradation variations in the abundance of the roc degrading bacteria during the starvation sludge were analyzed and are summarized in fig 3e we found that the relative abundance of roc degrading bacteria did not change significantly during the early period of aerobic starvation treatment however it significantly increased on day 43 from approximately 8 to 20 cytophagaceae were the main members of the enriched bacterial community and their abundance accounts for about 16 for specific rocs as shown in fig s4 the relative abundance of bpaf and gbp degrading bacteria did not increase significantly during the aerobic starvation process the bpa degrading bacteria also generally remained stable approximately 2 in the early stage but significantly increased to about 16 on day 43 3 4 impact of aerobic starvation on the gene expression of roc degrading bacteria through the above 16s rrna gene sequencing data analysis it was found that the bacterial community did not significantly change during the initial period of aerobic starvation treatment the bpa degrading bacteria were observed proliferating on day 43 which coincides with the increase of the bpa degradation efficiency however the degradation efficiency of bpaf and gbp both increased and decreased substantially between day 1 and day 4 fig 1 and no significant bacterial community changes occurred during this process therefore it was inferred that the increased bpaf and gbp degradation efficiency might relate to the expression of corresponding genes metatranscriptomic sequencing was performed on samples taken from different periods day 0 day 3 and day 43 to investigate the expressions of the aromatic compound degradation genes the compositions of pathways of significantly differentially expressed genes on day 3 and day 43 were shown in fig s5 it was found that the sequences assigned to metabolism pathways significantly increased on both day3 and day43 with abundances of 65 17 and 49 19 respectively fig 4 a and b show the up or down regulated genes wilcoxon test p 0 05 on day 3 1509 genes were up regulated and 506 genes were down regulated compared to day 0 on day 43 the number of up regulated genes was 1189 and the number of down regulated genes was 445 the higher number of up regulated genes related to aromatic compound degradation suggested that some functions of the bacterial community might be enhanced during the aerobic starvation treatment process based on the aromadeg database duarte et al 2014 we analyzed the up regulated aromatic compound degradation genes in the aerobic starvation sludge of day 3 and day 43 and their abundances were shown in fig 4c and d the relative abundances of these gene transcripts in starved sludge day 3 and day 43 were obviously higher than those in the seeding sludge and the mean difference was close to 1 8 suggesting an increase in the expression of these aromatic compound degradation genes according to the classification in the aromadeg database the up regulated aromatic compound degradation genes were further clustered into 9 clusters i e salicylate phthalate ligb protocatechuate ligb protocatechuate gentisate exd monocyclic substrates exdo miscellaneous exdo bicyclic substrates and benzoate with different functions fig 4e and f among them in both day 3 and day 43 samples phthalate is the dominant cluster followed by ligb homoprotocatechuate and benzoate although gbp is not aromatic compound its degradation also related to the increase of aromatic compound degradation genes suggesting that some aromatic compound degradation genes may also be responsible for the degradation of other refractory organic compounds duarte et al 2014 we also tried to recover mags table s2 from the metagenomic data by assembling and binning to investigate the bacterial functions the ani calculation results showed that the ani values between the mags and the species in the database are relatively high fig 5 a which indicates that the mags are similar to known species and further confirms the taxonomy annotation results according to the taxonomic annotation results and the roc degrading bacteria identified by mmi fig 3d three mags affiliated with sphingomonadaceae were potential bpaf degrading bacteria five mags affiliated with rhizobiaceae and saprospiraceae were potential gbp degrading bacteria and six mags affiliated with sphingomonadaceae and rhizobiaceae were potential bpa degrading bacteria in order to analyze the activity of these roc degrading bacteria during the aerobic starvation treatment process we mapped the metatranscriptomic data to the mags to obtain the gene coverage as shown in fig 5b the coverages of the day 3 samples average 0 16 on sphingomonadaceae were significantly higher than those of the day 0 samples average 0 08 similarly the coverages of the day 3 samples on the gbp degrading bacteria saprospiraceae average 0 05 were also higher than those of the day 0 samples average 0 01 for bpa degrading bacteria sphingomonadaceae and rhizobiaceae had significantly higher coverages in the day 43 samples to further confirm the degradation ability of these bacteria the protein sequences predicted from the mags were compared with the aromadeg database four mags affiliated with sphingomonas agrobacterium blastomonas and sphingopyxis were found to carry aromatic degradation genes as shown in fig 5d in total four aromatic degradation genes were identified from the four mags and all of them are the dioxygenase gene furthermore the metatranscriptomic data of day 0 day 3 and day 43 were mapped to these four mags and fig 5c shows the relative abundance of degradation gene expression in sphingomonas blastomonas and sphingopyxis which gradually increased in the starvation process meanwhile the degradation gene expression in agrobacterium in the day 3 samples was relatively higher 4 discussion in this study we found that the degradation efficiencies of bpaf gbp and bpa were significantly enhanced after the aerobic starvation treatment the maximum degradation efficiencies of gbp and bpaf were observed on the second day of the aerobic starvation treatment after which they declined rapidly the reason could be that the seeding sludge contains a certain proportion of bacteria capable of degrading bpaf and gbp but these bacteria can also live on other carbon sources a variety of organic matters including adsorbed organic matters guellil et al 2001 and extracellular polymer substances sponza 2003 are present in activated sludge and can be used as carbon sources by microorganisms zhang et al 2014 for example the acinetobacter species able to metabolize both acetate and phenolic compounds were reported in one of our previous studies sun et al 2019a therefore when the easily degradable organic matters in the bioreactor were depleted bpaf and gbp can be utilized as carbon sources by the corresponding degrading bacteria this inference was confirmed by the microbial community analysis and metatranscriptomic analysis the results showed that the microbial community did not significantly change but the genes related to aromatic compound degradation were up regulated during the early stage of the aerobic starvation treatment however the maximum degradation efficiency of bpa was different from those of gbp and bpaf and occurred on the 43rd day the microbial community analysis and mmi analysis showed that the relative abundance of bpa degrading bacteria sphingomonas achromobacter etc significantly increased in the later period of the starvation treatment this suggests that these bpa degrading bacteria are less abundant in the seeding sludge and can be enriched during the aerobic starvation treatment previous studies have shown that the abundance of sphingomonas and achromobacter is usually lower than 0 1 in municipal wastewater treatment plants wu et al 2019 which was generally comparable with the seeding sludge used in this study it s worth noting that the increase of the relative abundance of these bacteria could also be potentially resulted from the decrease of some other bacteria therefore further studies are still needed to explore the detailed microbial community changes during the starvation process through monitoring the changes in the microbial community structure of the activated sludge during the aerobic starvation process it was found that the bacterial community composition generally remained stable in the initial 30 days and changed significantly after 36 days this trend of the microbial community change was seldom reported in previous literature but was not unexpected it is well known the organic matters and other nutrients are important factors for microorganisms and nutrient depletion could affect the structure of the microbial community in activated sludge wang et al 2020 however the time required for this change to occur could be relatively long under aerobic starvation condition one reason could be that the dna of some dead bacteria are protected by the cell wall nagata 2005 leading to a relatively long time for dna degradation besides some bacteria may survive under the aerobic condition and most bacteria that utilize bacterial residues to survive might be oligotrophic bacteria and their growth rates were usually slow gray et al 2019 therefore it takes a long time for the composition of the microbial community to change significantly during the aerobic starvation process during this process only a limited number of bacterial species could survive by using the bacterial residues quaiyum et al 2020 some survival bacteria such as sphingomonas and cytophagaceae could degrade bpa leading to the increase of bpa degradation after a long aerobic starvation treatment after investigating the bacteria community and the specific bacteria abundance variations during aerobic starvation process it was found that the relative abundance of the bpa degrading bacteria did not change significantly during the initial period of aerobic starvation treatment but it increased significantly on day 43 and the members of cytophagaceae were the main bpa degrading bacteria in a previous study cydzik kwiatkowska and zielińska 2018 reported that the cytophaga species affiliated with cytophagaceae have the ability to degrade bpa it was also reported that cytophagaceae are capable of dissolving cells and degrading cellulose bernardet et al 2002 which is probably why they can survive by consuming dead microorganisms during the aerobic starvation process traditionally roc degrading bacteria were cultivated with wastewater containing specific pollutants for example the bpa degrading bacteria were obtained by this way in the previous studies gray et al 2019 although it took over 30 days to enrich the bpa degrading bacterial consortium the time is still shorter or comparable to the traditional cultivation method sathyamoorthy et al 2018 in addition compared with the traditional method the operation of the aerobic starvation is much easier and the cost is lower therefore this may provide a new approach for enrichment of roc degrading bacteria during the aerobic starvation process the expression of aromatic degradation genes was found to be up regulated according to previous studies phthalate and benzoate are important intermediate products in the degradation process of bpaf yang et al 2019 gbp henning et al 2018 and bpa zhang et al 2013 and the benzoate 1 2 dioxygenase could transform benzoate into cis 1 6 dihydroxy 2 4 cyclohexadiene 1 carboxylic acid within the benzoate to catechol degradation pathway haddad et al 2001 the phthalate 4 5 dioxygenase enzyme can catalyze the conversion of phthalate to protocatechuate bourguignon et al 2016 the homoprotocatechuate 2 3 dioxygenase of the ligb superfamily roper and cooper 1990 can further metabolize the homoprotocatechuate ring cleavage product via the meta cleavage pathway during the aerobic starvation process the expression of the genes encoding these proteins increased which explained the increased degradation efficiency of bpaf gbp and bpa moreover these genes were also carried by the mags recovered from the metagenomes for example bin12 blastomonas and bin30 sphingopyxis carried 1 2 dioxygenase genes and the 4 5 dioxygenase gene was found in bin10 sphingomonas and bin11 agrobacterium the 2 3 dioxygenase gene was in bins 10 12 and 30 this further confirmed the presence of roc degrading bacteria in the aerobic starvation treated sludge the increase of bpa degradation gene expression is related to the abundance of degrading bacteria while bpaf and gbp are related to the activity of degrading bacteria several previous studies have reported the co metabolism can improve the removal efficiency of rocs through the synergistic effect nsenga kumwimba and meng 2019 however it was also reported that when multiple organic substances are present the degradation of different substances may interfere with each other reardon et al 2000 the results of this study from the perspective of metabolic competition suggest that after the organic matters in the sludge is consumed by the aerobic starvation and the expression of roc such as bpaf and gbp degradation genes in the sludge could be increased to promote the degradation of these substances the three compounds bpa bpaf and gbp investigated in this study are frequently detected organic micropollutants omps in wastewater petrie et al 2015 potential omp risks to aquatic environments and human health have caused researchers to find ways to remove these organics from wastewater martínez alcalá et al 2021 however low concentration μg l or lower and degradation resistance has hindered the implementation of removing omps from wastewater the findings of this study provide a potentially novel strategy to develop and design omp removal technologies and processes by utilizing the residual sludge generated from the regular biological treatment processes of wwtps for example an additional bioreactor could be set to perform the starvation and the starved sludge can be used to remove omps or low concentration refractory organic matters from the effluent of regular biological processes in addition to removing complex organic matters reduction of sludge can also be achieved by taking advantage of the aerobic starvation process nevertheless although bpa bpaf and gbp could be efficiently degraded by starved sludge we also noticed that the removal efficiency of some other refractory compounds e g ibu and dcf was not significantly enhanced fig s6 one possible reason could be that the degrading bacteria of these compounds were eliminated under the starvation conditions it s also possible that the degrading bacteria do not present in the activated sludge used in this study therefore further studies are required to investigate the detailed mechanisms of the aerobic starvation and the degradation process of organic matters especially low concentration complex organic matters improvements on the microbial community selection during the aerobic starvation process are expected to make this approach applicable to remove more complex organics from wastewater 5 conclusions in this study we found that aerobic starvation treatment can significantly improve the degradation efficiencies of some rocs in activated sludge systems the highest degradation rates of bpaf 11 4 mg g vss h and gbp 8 9 mg g vss h were achieved on the second day of the starvation process while the degradation rate of bpa on the 43rd day reached the maximum value of 0 8 mg g vss h based on mmi 16s rrna gene sequencing metagenomic sequencing and metatranscriptomic sequencing studies it was found that the mechanisms of degradation efficiency changes under starvation conditions of different rocs are different the increase of the expression of some roc degrading genes in starved sludge enhances the degradation of bpaf and gbp and the increase of relative abundance of bpa degrading bacteria sphingomonas achromobacter etc under starvation conditions leads to the increase of bpa degradation

15521,norovirus infections are among the major causes of acute gastroenteritis worldwide in germany norovirus infections are the most frequently reported cause of gastroenteritis although only laboratory confirmed cases are officially counted the high infectivity and environmental persistence of norovirus makes the virus a relevant pathogen for water related infections in the 2017 guidelines for potable water reuse the world health organization proposes norovirus as a reference pathogen for viral pathogens for quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra a challenge for qmra is that norovirus data are rarely available over long monitoring periods to assess inter annual variability of the associated health risk raising the question about the relevance of this source of variability regarding potential risk management alternatives moreover norovirus infections show high prevalence during winter and early spring and lower incidence during summer therefore our objective is to derive risk scenarios for assessing the potential relevance of the within and between year variability of norovirus concentrations in municipal wastewater for the assessment of health risks of fieldworkers if treated wastewater is used for irrigation in agriculture to this end we use the correlation between norovirus influent concentration and reported epidemiological incidence r² 0 93 found at a large city in germany risk scenarios are subsequently derived from long term reported epidemiological data by applying a bayesian regression approach for assessing the practical relevance for wastewater reuse we apply the risk scenarios to different irrigation patterns under various treatment options namely status quo and irrigation on demand while status quo refers to an almost all year irrigation the latter assumes that irrigation only takes place during the vegetation period from may september our results indicate that the log difference of infection risks between scenarios may vary between 0 8 and 1 7 log given the same level of pre treatment they also indicate that under the same exposure scenario the between year variability of norovirus infection risk may be 1log which makes it a relevant factor to consider in future qmra studies and studies which aim at evaluating safe water reuse applications the predictive power and wider use of epidemiological data as a suitable predictor variable should be further validated with paired multi year data keywords qmra water reuse bayesian modeling risk assessment norovirus abbreviations who world health organization qmra quantitative microbial risk assessment rki robert koch institute ppd posterior predictive distribution agi acute gastro enteric illness nov gii norovirus genogroup ii daly disability adjusted life years r mse root mean squared error data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra has been developed to support risk based decision making by quantifying health risks resulting from the exposure to pathogenic microorganisms who 2016 qmra supports the assessment of the performance of a system to achieve pre defined health targets and can be used to explore various risk management alternatives in qmra the source water concentration of pathogens is an essential model input because source water concentrations and exposure scenarios determine operational health targets in terms of required log removal values lrv therefore the better the understanding of source water pathogen concentrations including its variability e g seasonal and uncertainty e g parameter uncertainty the better risk reduction measures can be tailored to the local circumstances in germany norovirus nv infections are the leading cause of reported cases of viral gastroenteritis among all age groups pathogenic noroviruses are subdivided into three groups gi gii and giv with nv gii 4 being currently responsible for 70 80 of all reported gastroenteritis cases bernard et al 2014 de graaf et al 2015 nv gii are highly infective and resistant in the environment are considered relevant pathogens for water related infections and are included in multiple studies related to water reuse applications sales ortells et al 2015 soller et al 2018 2017 despite criticism towards using nv as a reference pathogen in qmra which origins from the fact that norovirus is not readily culturable from environmental samples nappier et al 2018 norovirus was included as a reference pathogen in the 2017 who guidelines for potable water reuse which underlines its relevance for water reuse applications who 2017 in probabilistic qmra studies sources water pathogen concentration are described as random variables distributions fitted to pathogen data in the source water aim at representing the existing variability of these pathogens over a specific period usually one year in this context a potential source of variability whose relevance has rarely been addressed in water related qmra studies is the within and between year variability of nv concentrations in wastewater and how these variations might affect risk management alternatives in most studies nv concentration are measured over periods of 1 year huang et al 2022 therefore the question arises about how inter annual nv variations might affect risk assessment results and thus risk management alternatives for longer periods to address this question approaches for deriving plausible risk scenarios are needed additionally to inter annual variations in moderate climates like e g in germany nv outbreaks and water demands in agriculture show an inverse seasonality meaning that nv incidences are lowest in summer bernard et al 2014 where water demands in agriculture is at its peak and vice versa seasonal differences i e intra annual variations of wastewater concentrations have been confirmed in a review of nv in wastewater by eftim et al 2017 therefore for the special case of agricultural water reuse adapting irrigation periods to low incidence periods may be a feasible low tech and cheap risk reduction measure complementing other more obvious risk reduction measures like wastewater disinfection protective farming practices or the use of exposure reduced irrigation technologies e g drip irrigation for nv there is a direct causal relationship between infection and virus shedding atmar et al 2008 teunis et al 2015 and therefore the presence of these viruses in municipal wastewater while virus concentrations in wastewater have been used to estimate the variability of incidence in the population hellmer et al 2014 medema et al 2020 long term reported incidence has not been used to derive plausible risk scenarios for addressing the relevance of intra and inter annual variations for irrigation related exposure of fieldworker in agricultural water reuse therefore the objectives of the present study are to a apply this technique to an existing reuse site to assess the potential relevance of inter annual variations of nv concentrations for the assessment of health risks for fieldworkers exposed via sprinkler irrigation b derive practical implications of the estimated inter annual variations of nv gii concentrations for the derivation of local lrv values and c assess the risk reduction potential of adapting irrigation periods to low incidence based on the expected intra annual within year variability 2 methods the city of braunschweig is considered a suitable location to investigate the formulated questions as a it is a large water reuse location in germany nominal wwtp size 275 000 p e applied load 350 000 p e so that population incidences of virus infections are potentially represented in the wastewater composition b it uses treated water to irrigate agricultural areas almost during all the year and c long term epidemiological data on reported norovirus cases are available on a weekly basis for the district of braunschweig cf section 2 1 2 by public epidemiological databases wastewater is treated by standard primary treatment with subsequent activated sludge treatment to this day no disinfection unit is implemented therefore irrigation is restricted to energy crops or products which are consumed only after further industrial processing however current research activities explore the potential benefits of upgrading water quality to class a according to european standards for water reuse which would allow to diversify the products grown on the area in braunschweig irrigation takes place all year round except for a short period between december and january irrigation is conducted via sprinkler irrigation and is organized by the wastewater association braunschweig avb which matches the water demands of farmers with the quantities provided by the wastewater treatment plant irrigation itself is conducted by irrigation managers and workers associated with the avb they are responsible to placing and operating irrigation machines on the specific sectors of the agriculture areas these workers represent the group of people which is at risk of being regularly and directly exposed to pathogens via spray of treated wastewater cf section 2 3 2 2 1 data collection 2 1 1 influent data of norovirus gii norovirus samples were collected from october 15th to december 3rd 2014 manual grab samples were taken from the influent of the wastewater treatment plant once per week on wednesdays during morning peak flow samples were collected into sterile plastic bottles of 1l after sample collection samples were frozen and sent to the university of barcelona for subsequent nv rna analysis nv have been shown to keep intact for several freezing and thawing cycles richards et al 2012 which justifies freezing as a sample conservation strategy nv in water samples were concentrated with the skimmed milk flocculation protocol calgua et al 2013a 2013b the viral rna concentrations were quantified by specific qpcr assays for nov gii kageyama et al 2003 loisy et al 2005 2 1 2 collecting epidemiological data epidemiological data were collected from the publicly available epidemiological database survstat which summarizes illness caused by any nv genogroup and type as norovirus gastroenteritis only cases which fulfill the reference definition were included in the query which includes cases confirmed by either pcr test antigen tests or electron microscope detection this definition and the comparatively mild illness of nv infections are known to cause high numbers of underreporting caused by asymptomatic infections of nv differences in tolerance levels before consulting a physician and difference in testing and reporting practices between physicians when gastroenteritis is diagnosed bernard et al 2014 from survstat we queried weekly data on reported nv cases for the district of braunschweig on a nuts 2 level nomenclature des unités territoriales statistiques the nuts 2 level includes the city of braunschweig and surrounding districts it is larger than the catchment of the wwtp whose geographic boundaries would better match the boundaries at a nuts 3 level we prefer the nuts 2 level of geographic boundary over the more detailed nuts 3 level because of the high expected underreporting for nv increasing the population size makes the observed incidence more robust against the detection of single outbreaks moreover as braunschweig is a regional economic center commuting back and forth the city from outer districts is common so that inhabitants of these districts are likely to contribute to the city s wastewater composition and incidence dynamic in their annual seasonal reports about nv infections health authorities of lower saxony underline that annual spatial differences of reported incidence between neighboring districts are more likely to be caused by differences in specific diagnose regime and reporting behavior rather than other causes like e g age structure therefore staying at the nuts 2 level is considered the best choice for balancing the robustness of the incidence estimate while accounting for regional behavior of norovirus infections the specific query is attached to the supporting information si for detailed evaluation cf section 2 2 we only consider the years between 2001 first year of reporting and 2019 as 2020 and 2021 are influenced by the corona pandemic and thus a potentially overburdened health reporting system 2 2 data analysis 2 2 1 data preparation for an initial quality check the collected epidemiological data were plotted for detecting any obvious visual irregularities moreover the dataset was checked for completeness by counting the number of observations in each calendar year we applied an inclusion criterion of maximum 5 2 data points of missing data for each year if missing values existed values were imputed by linear interpolation which we prefer over alternative imputation methods like mean or median imputation due to the expected auto correlation in the data set the years 2004 2009 and 2015 have 53 calendar weeks to align the periodicity between years and ease computations incidence values were added to the values of week 52 and week 53 was removed from the dataset this adjustment has no effect on the risk calculation as december and january are not included in any risk modelling scenario 2 2 2 descriptive analysis the reported norovirus incidence is grouped by year and calendar week which after the application of the inclusion criterion cf section 5 leads to 14 observations for each week the summary mean median minimum and maximum are calculated additionally negative binomial distributions are fitted to each dataset and 95 credible and prediction intervals are simulated from the posterior distribution for all statistical analyses we apply a bayesian approach to statistical inference using the programming languages r r development core team 2008 stan standevelopmentteam 2017 and the interface between r and stan brms bürkner 2017 for the negative binomial regression brms implements the following parameterization which allows the negative binomial to be interpreted as a poisson distribution whose variance parameter µ is complemented by an additional factor for overdispersion ϕ scaled by µ² 1 negbinomial y μ ϕ y ϕ 1 y μ μ ϕ y ϕ μ ϕ ϕ 2 e y μ and var y μ μ 2 ϕ 2 2 3 bayesian regression modelling for developing risk scenarios in the present study we use reported incidence as a relative index to create plausible risk scenarios for the variability of nov gii concentrations in municipal wastewater using statistical regression models due to the continuous evolvements of nv genotypes and existing underreporting it is not likely that the correlation between wastewater concentrations and reported incidence observed in one year remains exactly constant over time thus using the reported incidence to predict nv wastewater concentration for a specific point in time may not always be accurate however we argue that the longer term variability in reported incidence reflects the longer term variability of norovirus infections and illness within the population for example stegmaier et al 2020 compared differences in spread dynamics of influenza and nv in the population based on data provided by the survstat database therefore we further argue that generating scenario predictions under the assumption of a constant correlation leads to estimates which might not necessarily be correct for each specific year but which can be considered realistic scenarios of unobserved situations the latter is a key element of risk assessment studies to emphasize this distinction we will write e g 2008 if we refer to the year and its related data and use the term incidence scenario is08 if we refer to the risk scenario derived from reported incidence in the literature different information can be found regarding whether wastewater concentrations correlate best with the incidence reported in the same week kazama et al 2017 or whether there is a delay in reporting rates hellmer et al 2014 reported peak concentrations of nv 2 weeks before an increase in incidence could be observed therefore we checked the correlation and goodness of fit cf section 3 1 for both the incidence of the current reporting week as well as to a 2 week rolling average which aggregates of the incidence of the present and the 2 subsequent weeks for the paired data first the pearson s correlation coefficient is calculated second three regression models which make different distributional assumptions are fitted and compared since both incidence and nov gii concentrations are all positive quantities we fit the relation on a logarithmic scale as candidate models a lognormal negative binomial and gamma regression are fitted to the paired data the parameterization of the negative binomial distribution follows the example above eqs 1 and 2 so that the location and scale parameters can be addressed separately the one for the gamma regression is shown in eqs 10 and 11 for the scale parameters φ σ and φ default prior distribution provided by the brms package were chosen which uses heavily tailed distributions to only introduce minimal information see eqs 5 8 13 lognormal regression 3 c n o v lognormal μ σ 4

estimation methods based on markov chain monte carlo mcmc for every model we ran four independent markov chains with 10 000 iterations and a warm up phase of 5000 thereby 20 000 independent posterior samples were created for further evaluation we chose this high number of samples as the posterior samples are not only used for estimation but also for subsequent risk simulation cf section 2 3 2 convergence of the markov chains were checked by inspecting whether the traceplots of the four chains were well mixed and by checking whether the gelman rubin diagnostic statistic r has converged to 1 the traceplot and convergence diagnostics of the selected model is shown in the si 2 2 4 model selection for selecting between models the expected log predictive density elpd is used the out of sample elpd is calculated using leave one out cross validation following the approach published by vehtari et al 2017 to this end the implemented function loo of the brms package is used the elpd is preferred over other methods for model comparison like e g mse or rmse as it explicitly accounts for different distributional assumptions by calculating the probability density of the held out data point and not only assesses the distance to the estimated mean the higher a model s elpd the better it is expected to predict new data additionally the bayesian approximation of r2 is simulated according to gelman et al 2019 the model with the highest elpd is selected 2 3 risk modeling 2 3 1 problem formulation risk modeling focuses on quantifying the risk reduction potential for fieldworkers of an irrigation on demand scenario in comparison to a status quo scenario under the scenario status quo irrigation takes place from february to the end of november thus from calendar week 5 to calendar week 47 under the scenario irrigation on demand we assume that irrigation to take place from may to september thus from week 16 to 36 this adaption is expected to reduce the risk in two ways first a reduction of irrigation period reduces the risk by a reduction of the number of exposure events per year cf eq 13 given an average weekly exposure rate secondly the risk of infection is reduced by avoiding irrigation during the peak season of nv infections to compare the practical relevance of the difference between scenarios we assess both the relative risk between scenarios given the same wastewater treatment performance and the required log reduction to achieve the same level of health protection cf section 2 3 4 for the latter a health benchmark is needed for which we apply a value of 10 2 per person per year pppy this value is arbitrary as no level of acceptable risk exists for fieldworkers in germany however it follows the rational that water related exposures should be considered safe and should not contribute to the overall disease burden the latter was quantified for acute gastrointestinal illness agi in germany among adults in a representative survey by wilking et al 2013 they found that that 9 out of 10 adults in germany experience a case of agi per year therefore the applied threshold of 10 2 is approximately 2 orders of magnitude below the existing disease burden and thus considered to be sufficiently safe or at least hardly detectable applying a disease per infection ratio of 0 7 and a disease burden of 5 10 4 disability adjusted life years dalys per case who 2017 results in a tolerable disease burden of 3 5 10 6 dalys pppy which is close to the threshold of 10 6 dalys pppy applied for drinking water 2 3 2 exposure assessment for modelling infection risks for the two irrigation and 14 incidence scenarios we use the weekly incidence and the model selected in section 3 2 to generate scenario predictions for nv concentrations for every week of every incidence scenario to this end we sample from the posterior predictive distribution ppd for every week during this period using the obtained parameter distributions from the simulated ppd the population distribution of the expected dose per exposure event is calculated by 14 d 10 c i n f l u e n t t 1 n l r v t v i n g e s t e d where d is the dose per exposure event cinfluent is the ppd of nov gii in lg gc l lrv is the log removal value for treatment step t n is the number of treatment steps and vingested is the ingested volume in l to isolate the effect of different annual irrigation periods we assume the remaining model inputs to be known without variation for the log reduction of the wastewater treatment plant before irrigation we run simulations for the range between 1 and 8 this allows to determine the sensitivity of derived risk indicators cf section 4 3 4 between scenarios as a function of the installed level of wastewater treatment for the volume ingested by fieldworkers vingested per exposure event via sprinkler irrigation and the frequency of exposure events we assume an ingestion of 0 1ml of treated wastewater to happen once a week this leads to 42 exposure events per year for the status quo scenario and 20 for the irrigation on demand scenario to assess the sensitivity of our result to these assumptions we additionally ran simulations for a a volume 1ml once per week b a volume of 0 1 twice per week in brief for risk simulation we follow the following algorithm 1 for each incidence scenario filter the scenario specific irrigation periods status quo irrigation on demand from the generated array of ppds 2 sample a random sample from each distribution of weekly nv gii simulation 42 for status quo 20 for irrigation on demand 3 for each sample apply the assumed log reduction and assumed volume per exposure event to estimate the dose per exposure event eq 14 4 calculate the infection probability per exposure event by applying the dose response of nov gii for disaggregated viruses cf section 0 eq 15 5 aggregate the calculated event probabilities into an estimate for the annual risk eq 16 and 6 repeat steps 2 5 for 1000 times to generate an uncertainty estimate for the average annual risk to further estimate the generated monte carlo error we repeated this simulation under the initial assumptions 0 1ml 1 week for 25 times 2 3 3 health effect assessment the dose response model for norovirus is subject of ongoing discussion until recently qmra studies which assessed the risk of norovirus infection relied on the dose response relation published by teunis et al 2008 which was simplified by messner et al 2014 and criticized to be highly uncertain and overly conservative for low concentrations by schmidt 2015 the dose response model was derived only for norovirus of genogroup i so that subsequent qmra studies had to make the inherent assumption that this dose response relationship would apply for all norovirus genogroups and genotypes a summary of the discussion and practical recommendations was provided by van abel et al 2017 recently teunis et al 2020 summarized the information from challenge studies and outbreaks using a bayesian hierarchical modelling approach to derive an updated generalized dose response relationship for norovirus of genogroups i and ii using the secretor status of the exposed person as an additional predictor variable we consider the latter study as the most comprehensive study on this topic so far so that we base our risk estimate on the parameters reported there we also chose this study as it provides specific estimates for the dose response parameters for nov gii which our study focuses on the dose repose model is based on gene copies which is in line with the data measured at the wwtp as secretor negative se persons are widely protected against norovirus infections we focus our analysis secretor positive people and assume all fieldworkers to be se thus we calculate the population distribution of risk outcomes per exposure event as the probability of infection pinf from the population distribution of simulated doses d by 15 p inf exposure 1 1 f 1 a a b d as parameter values we use the median of their posterior distributions as reported in table a13 of teunis et al 2020 namely a 0 23 and b 5 04 for solving the confluent hypergeometric function we use the function hyperg 1f of the gsl package of the r programming language we aggregate the individual event probabilities pi pn to an estimate of the annual infection risk pannual by 16 p a n n u a l 1 i 1 n 1 p inf exposure i 2 3 4 risk characterization to characterize the risk we assess both the statistical and practical significance of the obtained results to assess whether the difference between the simulated risk distributions are statistically significant we derive a bayesian p value from the simulated average annual risk to this end the average risk distributions for the status quo scenario are subtracted from the distribution of the irrigation of demand scenario for each incidence scenario the proportion of samples of the resulting difference distribution 0 is used as an approximation for the probability of the two distributions coming from the same underlying population if the calculated probability is 0 05 the two distributions are considered statistically different since we simulated 1000 annual risk samples of for each incidence scenario the lower limit for this approach is 0 001 which is sufficiently low for an assessment of the practical significance we calculate the risk ratio and log difference in risk between scenarios for each incidence scenario and each applied log removal 14 r i s k r a t i o r i s k a n n u a l s t a t u s q u o r i s k a n n u a l i r r i g a t i o n o n d e m a n d this corresponds to the differences in risk assuming the same level of wastewater treatment for both irrigation scenarios additionally we deduce the log removal needed to obtain the same level of health protection given the applied exposure scenario for each scenario the required log removal for achieving a value pinf 1 is deduced by linear interpolation between of the closest points of the discrete evaluations of the resulting risk function in the range 1 8 lrv subsequently the difference between scenarios is calculated as measure of additional health benefit due to changes in irrigation patterns 3 results the results of the initial quality control are shown in fig 1 a in the si from the data no obvious trends in the development of reported norovirus incidence can be determined which would indicate an underlying systematic effect instead peaks of norovirus outbreaks during the winter months reoccur annually with differences in amplitude the quality check for data completeness revealed complete datasets from 2009 2019 2001 2003 and to a lesser extent 2004 and 2005 showed relevant data gaps and were removed the years 2006 2 missing 2007 2008 1 missing each stayed within acceptable limits 3 1 descriptive analysis fig 1 shows the distribution of weekly reported norovirus of incidence in the district of braunschweig from 2006 2019 incidences show a pronounced seasonality they start rising in early winter around weeks 47 48 december and reach maxima during weeks 1 8 january february lower numbers of reported cases during week 52 are considered artifacts caused by christmas and new year s vacations results show that during winter the median incidence varies between 4 and 7 per week single peak observations reach values of up to 37 in summer the reported incidence stays at lower numbers between 0 4 and 2 the peak incidences of 37 were reported outside both irrigation scenarios and thus do not affect risk calculations table 1 shows the raw nv measurements paired number of reported cases the incidence the rolling two week incidence the calculated pearson correlation factors the posterior mode of the distribution of the bayesian r² and the values for the calculated log predictive densities for the lognormal gamma and negative binomial regression respectively results show that during the sampling period between week 42 and 49 2014 an increase in both the incidence ranging from 0 37 to 6 7 and norovirus concentrations ranging from 104 3 107 gc l can be observed results show a strong positive correlation with a pearson correlation factor of 0 96 combined with the known causality between the number of infected people and norovirus wastewater concentration this observation provides support for the hypothesis that the variability of reported epidemiological provides information for generating plausible risk scenarios for the potential variability of wastewater concentrations 3 2 model selection regarding the candidate models the negative binomial approach indicates a slightly better higher elpd predictive performance than the lognormal and gamma approach since the negative binomial distribution is also the most logical choice for modeling over dispersed discrete data the negative binomial model is selected for simulating norovirus influent concentrations the models developed with the rolling 2 day mean performed slightly better than the models developed with the incidence reported in the same week although the difference is very small the negative binomial model based on the 2 day rolling mean incidence is used for subsequent estimations fig 1 d in the si shows model predictions against nv data 3 3 simulated influent concentrations results of the predicted weekly norovirus concentrations based on the mean 2 day rolling average incidence are shown in fig 2 results for the individual incidence scenarios are shown in the si the results show that following the dynamic of norovirus incidence the highest concentrations are expected to occur during winter week 48 12 prediction intervals cover peak concentrations of up to 109 genome copies per liter the highest measured concentration during the sampling period was 1 1 107 genome copies liter norovirus concentrations of up to 109 gc l have been reported for noroviruses in european wastewater treatment plants before eftim et al 2017 seis et al 2020 thus the upper range of expected unobserved observations is considered plausible and in line with existing knowledge about norovirus concentrations in wastewater average concentrations during the peak season are expected to lie at 107 gc l while during summer average concentrations are expected to lie 1 5 2 order of magnitude below with minima at 103 gc l in for scenario is06 and maxima at 106 e g in summer of scenario is14 3 4 annual risk for different irrigation scenarios fig 3 upper graph shows exemplarily the distribution of the average annual risk simulated for the two irrigation scenarios and 14 incidence scenarios assuming an installed pretreatment of 6 lrv the results indicate that within the same irrigation scenario result may vary by more than 1 order of magnitude for example with a lrv of 6 the mean annual risk of the status quo scenario ranges between 2 1 10 4 for is06 and 2 8 10 3 for is08 for the irrigation on demand scenario between 1 7 10 5 for is17 and 1 9 10 4 for is10 the minimum and maximum incidence scenarios do not correspond between irrigation scenarios because winter peaks dominating risk simulations under status quo conditions are cut off from the risk simulation in the irrigation on demand scenario this leads to different risk patterns fig 3 lower graph shows exemplarily the simulated annual risk as a function of the installed log removal for the incidence scenario is08 since the graphs from the individual incidence scenarios look very similar the remaining ones are provided in the si the calculated bayesian p values are statistically significant bayesian p value 0 001 for every single incidence scenario and installed pretreatment regarding the practical significance fig 5 shows that the effectiveness of a change in irrigation patterns depends on the installed pretreatment for the assumed exposure volume and frequency the calculated risk indicators risk ratio and log difference increase until the pre treatment reaches a value between 3 and 4 lrv and stay at an approximately constant level afterwards the sensitivity assay cf si fig 1 g 1 h reveals that the level of required pre treatment to reach stable conditions increases with the assumed exposure note however that once stable conditions are reached risk indicators between sensitivity scenarios stay within the margin of monte carlo error of the original exposure scenario this indicates that overall conclusions about the magnitude of expected differences ratios and thus the relevance of the inter and intra annual variability of nv remain valid against varying exposure assumptions lower risk indicators at lower pre treatment are caused by the fact that if the pretreatment is too low the simulated annual risk is very close to 1 for both scenarios if the constant level is reached the highest ratio is calculated for the is08 and is12 with risk ratios between 35 and 50 which corresponds to a log difference of 1 5 1 7 the lowest risk ratio and log difference is observed for is13 with values of 6 7 and 0 8 respectively the mean and median of the median log difference are 1 15 and 1 1 respectively making in it on average 10 15 times more likely to become infected under the status quo scenario in comparison to the irrigation on demand scenario once stable condition are reached regarding the required log removal to achieve the same level of health protection of 1 we calculate median lrv between 0 9 and 1 9 between incidence scenarios with a median of 1 2 lrv fig 4 note that while the absolute required lrv values increase with increasing exposure in the sensitivity assay the derived difference between irrigation scenarios stay within the monte carlo error and thus do not affect the overall conclusion of the analysis that means that the between year variability of the required treatment performance may be up to 1 order of magnitude and that an on average an additional order of magnitude can be achieved by adapting irrigation patterns to an irrigation in the demand scenario as a side note our results also illustrate the difference between statistical and practical significance as even the difference between scenarios at a pre treatment level of lrv equal to 1 is statistically significant while from a practical perspective this difference is irrelevant 4 discussion in the present study we used epidemiological data to assess the potential relevance of seasonal and between year variability of nv concentration in ww for risk assessment and management of fieldworkers in agriculture to this end we derived plausible risk scenarios from weekly incidence data on reported nv cases in the district of braunschweig several studies before confirmed both seasonal variations of nov gii concentrations as well as the positive correlations between wastewater concentrations and the number of reported nov gii cases incidence eftim et al 2017 hellmer et al 2014 huang et al 2022 kazama et al 2017 miura et al 2016 in previous studies the relation between pathogen concentrations in wastewater and incidence in the population was used to estimate the incidence in the population proposing that regular pathogen monitoring might function as an early warning system for diseases spreading in the population hellmer et al 2014 medema et al 2020 to the best of our knowledge our study is the first attempt to use this relationship to estimate the relevance of the between year variability of nv risk in water related qmra studies and eventually its potential practical implications regarding risk reduction potentials and performance requirements our results suggest that within and between year variability is likely to have a relevant impact on risk assessment results and thus should be considered a relevant factor to consider when evaluating local data for local qmra studies thereby our approach addresses a very common problem in qmra studies namely an assessment of the potential impact and relevance of the lack of multi year data for local risk management due to the low sample size n 7 of norovirus our own study has to be seen as a first attempt to use epidemiological data to estimate the relevance of inter annual variability of norovirus infections further validation of this approach with multi year data including seasonality on nv in wastewater versus reported nv infections is warranted low sample sizes are a common cause of uncertainty in qmra studies sales ortells et al 2015 based a risk estimate for nv from consumption of lettuce on a sample size similar to ours n 8 others based risk estimates on even smaller dataset e g amoueyan et al 2019 or mcbride et al 2013 n 4 complementing nov gii observations with additional information like long term reported incidence most likely leads to a more realistic estimate of the existing variability of nov gii risk in comparison to deriving input distribution for source water concentration solely from the data collected over a limited period of time using incidence to estimate variation of nov gii concentrations certainly constitutes an interesting alternative to only grouping norovirus data by season as seasons may be quite different as our results indicate in one of the single studies which measured nv over three years and correlated nv concentrations to reported agi cases kazama et al 2017 also found a significant positive correlation which indicates that correlations may hold for more than one year and gives some support for generating plausible risk scenarios from reported incidence therefore if epidemiological information is available it might be beneficial to check whether collected nv wastewater data come from a low average or high incidence year if data have been collected under low incidence conditions only an additional safety factor could be considered however our result also underline that there is a need for more long term monitoring data to better characterize the between year variability as a source of variation local multi year wastewater data are still the preferred source of information for risk assessment in comparison to deriving scenarios from epidemiological data and are also needed for further validating existing modelling approaches like ours in this context it is important to note that the relation i e regression parameters between wastewater concentrations and reported incidence cannot be transferred to other locations as reporting systems and practices may be different between countries even within germany the federal governmental structure of the reporting system makes the transfer of derived regression coefficients questionable next to inter annual variability we also assessed the practical relevance and the risk reduction potential of adapting irrigation periods to low incidence periods taking into account intra annual variations our results suggest that cutting off peak concentrations of nov gii from the exposure period may function as an additional effective risk reduction measure complementing wastewater treatment and disinfection however our result also indicate that depending on the exposure level a minimum level of wastewater treatment is necessary in order for this adaption to be most effective these results may be of practical importance because studies which aim at deriving required log reduction values may account for this additional source of variation moreover while our scenario is tailored to locations in moderate climates where irrigation is only partially necessary during the vegetation period the obtained results may also be relevant for seasonal adjustments of pre treatment options in cases where irrigation is applied all year e g greenhouses as well as for risk assessments in areas where water use is particularly seasonal like e g bathing water management note however that for risk management decisions other reference pathogens like protozoan and bacterial pathogens would need to be considered as well our study makes several simplifying assumptions and disregards several factors for example no consideration is given to a potential immune adaption of workers nov gii rapidly expresses new variants which affects immunity but might also affect infectivity indeed many of the peak incidence seasons can be linked to the occurrence of new variants of norovirus becoming dominant for example the high incidence in season 2007 2008 can be attributed the variant 2006b becoming the dominant norovirus variant another steep and early rise in germany is in winter 2016 is connected to a new recombinant variant gii p16 gii 2 niendorf et al 2017 the effect of new norovirus variants and immune adaption on risk calculations has not been explicitly addressed in water related qmra so far and remain subject of future research a further simplification in our study is that for isolating the effect of norovirus variation we assumed a constant treatment performance over the whole season however log removal of viruses via biological wastewater treatment may be affected by other factors like e g temperature both the under estimation of large outbreaks by the reporting system which pre dominantly occur in winter and the temperature effects are likely to further increase the calculated risk ratios as viruses are known the be more recalcitrant under cold conditions thus while our study already indicated the relevance of seasonal effects the true effect might be even more pronounced and should be considered in future research 5 conclusion risk scenarios derived from epidemiological data and nov gii wastewater concentrations indicate that between year variability is a relevant factor for assessing health risk resulting from nov gii exposure annual mean infection risk may vary by 1log between years under the same exposure scenario reducing irrigation to low incidence periods may reduce the risk infection 1log units given sufficient pre treatment the log removal to achieve the same level of health protection of 1 per period per year is at least 0 9 log between scenarios additional safety factors may be applied in future qmra studies to account for between year variability the predictive power and wider use of epidemiological data as a suitable predictor variable should be

15521,norovirus infections are among the major causes of acute gastroenteritis worldwide in germany norovirus infections are the most frequently reported cause of gastroenteritis although only laboratory confirmed cases are officially counted the high infectivity and environmental persistence of norovirus makes the virus a relevant pathogen for water related infections in the 2017 guidelines for potable water reuse the world health organization proposes norovirus as a reference pathogen for viral pathogens for quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra a challenge for qmra is that norovirus data are rarely available over long monitoring periods to assess inter annual variability of the associated health risk raising the question about the relevance of this source of variability regarding potential risk management alternatives moreover norovirus infections show high prevalence during winter and early spring and lower incidence during summer therefore our objective is to derive risk scenarios for assessing the potential relevance of the within and between year variability of norovirus concentrations in municipal wastewater for the assessment of health risks of fieldworkers if treated wastewater is used for irrigation in agriculture to this end we use the correlation between norovirus influent concentration and reported epidemiological incidence r² 0 93 found at a large city in germany risk scenarios are subsequently derived from long term reported epidemiological data by applying a bayesian regression approach for assessing the practical relevance for wastewater reuse we apply the risk scenarios to different irrigation patterns under various treatment options namely status quo and irrigation on demand while status quo refers to an almost all year irrigation the latter assumes that irrigation only takes place during the vegetation period from may september our results indicate that the log difference of infection risks between scenarios may vary between 0 8 and 1 7 log given the same level of pre treatment they also indicate that under the same exposure scenario the between year variability of norovirus infection risk may be 1log which makes it a relevant factor to consider in future qmra studies and studies which aim at evaluating safe water reuse applications the predictive power and wider use of epidemiological data as a suitable predictor variable should be further validated with paired multi year data keywords qmra water reuse bayesian modeling risk assessment norovirus abbreviations who world health organization

decision making by quantifying health risks resulting from the exposure to pathogenic microorganisms who 2016 qmra supports the assessment of the performance of a system to achieve pre defined health targets and can be used to explore various risk management alternatives in qmra the source water concentration of pathogens is an essential model input because source water concentrations and exposure scenarios determine operational health targets in terms of required log removal values lrv therefore the better the understanding of source water pathogen concentrations including its variability e g seasonal and uncertainty e g parameter uncertainty the better risk reduction measures can be tailored to the local circumstances in germany norovirus nv infections are the leading cause of reported cases of viral gastroenteritis among all age groups pathogenic noroviruses are subdivided into three groups gi gii and giv with nv gii 4 being currently responsible for 70 80 of all reported gastroenteritis cases bernard et al 2014 de graaf et al 2015 nv gii are highly infective and resistant in the environment are considered relevant pathogens for water related infections and are included in multiple studies related to water reuse applications sales ortells et al 2015 soller et al 2018 2017 despite criticism towards using nv as a reference pathogen in qmra which origins from the fact that norovirus is not readily culturable from environmental samples nappier et al 2018 norovirus was included as a reference pathogen in the 2017 who guidelines for potable water reuse which underlines its relevance for water reuse applications who 2017 in probabilistic qmra studies sources water pathogen concentration are described as random variables distributions fitted to pathogen data in the source water aim at representing the existing variability of these pathogens over a specific period usually one year in this context a potential source of variability whose relevance has rarely been addressed in water related qmra studies is the within and between year variability of nv concentrations in wastewater and how these variations might affect risk management alternatives in most studies nv concentration are measured over periods of 1 year huang et al 2022 therefore the question arises about how inter annual nv variations might affect risk assessment results and thus risk management alternatives for longer periods to address this question approaches for deriving plausible risk scenarios are needed additionally to inter annual variations in moderate climates like e g in germany nv outbreaks and water demands in agriculture show an inverse seasonality meaning that nv incidences are lowest in summer bernard et al 2014 where water demands in agriculture is at its peak and vice versa seasonal differences i e intra annual variations of wastewater concentrations have been confirmed in a review of nv in wastewater by eftim et al 2017 therefore for the special case of agricultural water reuse adapting irrigation periods to low incidence periods may be a feasible low tech and cheap risk reduction measure complementing other more obvious risk reduction measures like wastewater disinfection protective farming practices or the use of exposure reduced irrigation technologies e g drip irrigation for nv there is a direct causal relationship between infection and virus shedding atmar et al 2008 teunis et al 2015 and therefore the presence of these viruses in municipal wastewater while virus concentrations in wastewater have been used to estimate the variability of incidence in the population hellmer et al 2014 medema et al 2020 long term reported incidence has not been used to derive plausible risk scenarios for addressing the relevance of intra and inter annual variations for irrigation related exposure of fieldworker in agricultural water reuse therefore the objectives of the present study are to a apply this technique to an existing reuse site to assess the potential relevance of inter annual variations of nv concentrations for the assessment of health risks for fieldworkers exposed via sprinkler irrigation b derive practical implications of the estimated inter annual variations of nv gii concentrations for the derivation of local lrv values and c assess the risk reduction potential of adapting irrigation periods to low incidence based on the expected intra annual within year variability 2 methods the city of braunschweig is considered a suitable location to investigate the formulated questions as a it is a large water reuse location in germany nominal wwtp size 275 000 p e applied load 350 000 p e so that population incidences of virus infections are potentially represented in the wastewater composition b it uses treated water to irrigate agricultural areas almost during all the year and c long term epidemiological data on reported norovirus cases are available on a weekly basis for the district of braunschweig cf section 2 1 2 by public epidemiological databases wastewater is treated by standard primary treatment with subsequent activated sludge treatment to this day no disinfection unit is implemented therefore irrigation is restricted to energy crops or products which are consumed only after further industrial processing however current research activities explore the potential benefits of upgrading water quality to class a according to european standards for water reuse which would allow to diversify the products grown on the area in braunschweig irrigation takes place all year round except for a short period between december and january irrigation is conducted via sprinkler irrigation and is organized by the wastewater association braunschweig avb which matches the water demands of farmers with the quantities provided by the wastewater treatment plant irrigation itself is conducted by irrigation managers and workers associated with the avb they are responsible to placing and operating irrigation machines on the specific sectors of the agriculture areas these workers represent the group of people which is at risk of being regularly and directly exposed to pathogens via spray of treated wastewater cf section 2 3 2 2 1 data collection 2 1 1 influent data of norovirus gii norovirus samples were collected from october 15th to december 3rd 2014 manual grab samples were taken from the influent of the wastewater treatment plant once per week on wednesdays during morning peak flow samples were collected into sterile plastic bottles of 1l after sample collection samples were frozen and sent to the university of barcelona for subsequent nv rna analysis nv have been shown to keep intact for several freezing and thawing cycles richards et al 2012 which justifies freezing as a sample conservation strategy nv in water samples were concentrated with the skimmed milk flocculation protocol calgua et al 2013a 2013b the viral rna concentrations were quantified by specific qpcr assays for nov gii kageyama et al 2003 loisy et al 2005 2 1 2 collecting epidemiological data epidemiological data were collected from the publicly available epidemiological database survstat which summarizes illness caused by any nv genogroup and type as norovirus gastroenteritis only cases which fulfill the reference definition were included in the query which includes cases confirmed by either pcr test antigen tests or electron microscope detection this definition and the comparatively mild illness of nv infections are known to cause high numbers of underreporting caused by asymptomatic infections of nv differences in tolerance levels before consulting a physician and difference in testing and reporting practices between physicians when gastroenteritis is diagnosed bernard et al 2014 from survstat we queried weekly data on reported nv cases for the district of braunschweig on a nuts 2 level nomenclature des unités territoriales statistiques the nuts 2 level includes the city of braunschweig and surrounding districts it is larger than the catchment of the wwtp whose geographic boundaries would better match the boundaries at a nuts 3 level we prefer the nuts 2 level of geographic boundary over the more detailed nuts 3 level because of the high expected underreporting for nv increasing the population size makes the observed incidence more robust against the detection of single outbreaks moreover as braunschweig is a regional economic center commuting back and forth the city from outer districts is common so that inhabitants of these districts are likely to contribute to the city s wastewater composition and incidence dynamic in their annual seasonal reports about nv infections health authorities of lower saxony underline that annual spatial differences of reported incidence between neighboring districts are more likely to be caused by differences in specific diagnose regime and reporting behavior rather than other causes like e g age structure therefore staying at the nuts 2 level is considered the best choice for balancing the robustness of the incidence estimate while accounting for regional behavior of norovirus infections the specific query is attached to the supporting information si for detailed evaluation cf section 2 2 we only consider the years between 2001 first year of reporting and 2019 as 2020 and 2021 are influenced by the corona pandemic and thus a potentially overburdened health reporting system 2 2 data analysis 2 2 1 data preparation for an initial quality check the collected epidemiological data were plotted for detecting any obvious visual irregularities moreover the dataset was checked for completeness by counting the number of observations in each calendar year we applied an inclusion criterion of maximum 5 2 data points of missing data for each year if missing values existed values were imputed by linear interpolation which we prefer over alternative imputation methods like mean or median imputation due to the expected auto correlation in the data set the years 2004 2009 and 2015 have 53 calendar weeks to align the periodicity between years and ease computations incidence values were added to the values of week 52 and week 53 was removed from the dataset this adjustment has no effect on the risk calculation as december and january are not included in any risk modelling scenario 2 2 2 descriptive analysis the reported norovirus incidence is grouped by year and calendar week which after the application of the inclusion criterion cf section 5 leads to 14 observations for each week the summary mean median minimum and maximum are calculated additionally negative binomial distributions are fitted to each dataset and 95 credible and prediction intervals are simulated from the posterior distribution for all statistical analyses we apply a bayesian approach to statistical inference using the programming languages r r development core team 2008 stan standevelopmentteam 2017 and the interface between r and stan brms bürkner 2017 for the negative binomial regression brms implements the following parameterization which allows the negative binomial to be interpreted as a poisson distribution whose variance parameter µ is complemented by an additional factor for overdispersion ϕ scaled by µ² 1 negbinomial y μ ϕ y ϕ 1 y μ μ ϕ y ϕ μ ϕ ϕ 2 e y μ and var y μ μ 2 ϕ 2 2 3 bayesian regression modelling for developing risk scenarios in the present study we use reported incidence as a relative index to create plausible risk scenarios for the variability of nov gii concentrations in municipal wastewater using statistical regression models due to the continuous evolvements of nv genotypes and existing underreporting it is not likely that the correlation between wastewater concentrations and reported incidence observed in one year remains exactly constant over time thus using the reported incidence to predict nv wastewater concentration for a specific point in time may not always be accurate however we argue that the longer term variability in reported incidence reflects the longer term variability of norovirus infections and illness within the population for example stegmaier et al 2020 compared differences in spread dynamics of influenza and nv in the population based on data provided by the survstat database therefore we further argue that generating scenario predictions under the assumption of a constant correlation leads to estimates which might not necessarily be correct for each specific year but which can be considered realistic scenarios of unobserved situations the latter is a key element of risk assessment studies to emphasize this distinction we will write e g 2008 if we refer to the year and its related data and use the term incidence scenario is08 if we refer to the risk scenario derived from reported incidence in the literature different information can be found regarding whether wastewater concentrations correlate best with the incidence reported in the same week kazama et al 2017 or whether there is a delay in reporting rates hellmer et al 2014 reported peak concentrations of nv 2 weeks before an increase in incidence could be observed therefore we checked the correlation and goodness of fit cf section 3 1 for both the incidence of the current reporting week as well as to a 2 week rolling average which aggregates of the incidence of the present and the 2 subsequent weeks for the paired data first the pearson s correlation coefficient is calculated second three regression models which make different distributional assumptions are fitted and compared since both incidence and nov gii concentrations are all positive quantities we fit the relation on a logarithmic scale as candidate models a lognormal negative binomial and gamma regression are fitted to the paired data the parameterization of the negative binomial distribution follows the example above eqs 1 and 2 so that the location and scale parameters can be addressed separately the one for the gamma regression is shown in eqs 10 and 11 for the scale parameters φ σ and φ default prior distribution provided by the brms package were chosen which uses heavily tailed distributions to only introduce minimal information see eqs 5 8 13 lognormal regression 3 c n o v lognormal μ σ 4

estimation methods based on markov chain monte carlo mcmc for every model we ran four independent markov chains with 10 000 iterations and a warm up phase of 5000 thereby 20 000 independent posterior samples were created for further evaluation we chose this high number of samples as the posterior samples are not only used for estimation but also for subsequent risk simulation cf section 2 3 2 convergence of the markov chains were checked by inspecting whether the traceplots of the four chains were well mixed and by checking whether the gelman rubin diagnostic statistic r has converged to 1 the traceplot and convergence diagnostics of the selected model is shown in the si 2 2 4 model selection for selecting between models the expected log predictive density elpd is used the out of sample elpd is calculated using leave one out cross validation following the approach published by vehtari et al 2017 to this end the implemented function loo of the brms package is used the elpd is preferred over other methods for model comparison like e g mse or rmse as it explicitly accounts for different distributional assumptions by calculating the probability density of the held out data point and not only assesses the distance to the estimated mean the higher a model s elpd the better it is expected to predict new data additionally the bayesian approximation of r2 is simulated according to gelman et al 2019 the model with the highest elpd is selected 2 3 risk modeling 2 3 1 problem formulation risk modeling focuses on quantifying the risk reduction potential for fieldworkers of an irrigation on demand scenario in comparison to a status quo scenario under the scenario status quo irrigation takes place from february to the end of november thus from calendar week 5 to calendar week 47 under the scenario irrigation on demand we assume that irrigation to take place from may to september thus from week 16 to 36 this adaption is expected to reduce the risk in two ways first a reduction of irrigation period reduces the risk by a reduction of the number of exposure events per year cf eq 13 given an average weekly exposure rate secondly the risk of infection is reduced by avoiding irrigation during the peak season of nv infections to compare the practical relevance of the difference between scenarios we assess both the relative risk between scenarios given the same wastewater treatment performance and the required log reduction to achieve the same level of health protection cf section 2 3 4 for the latter a health benchmark is needed for which we apply a value of 10 2 per person per year pppy this value is arbitrary as no level of acceptable risk exists for fieldworkers in germany however it follows the rational that water related exposures should be considered safe and should not contribute to the overall disease burden the latter was quantified for acute gastrointestinal illness agi in germany among adults in a representative survey by wilking et al 2013 they found that that 9 out of 10 adults in germany experience a case of agi per year therefore the applied threshold of 10 2 is approximately 2 orders of magnitude below the existing disease burden and thus considered to be sufficiently safe or at least hardly detectable applying a disease per infection ratio of 0 7 and a disease burden of 5 10 4 disability adjusted life years dalys per case who 2017 results in a tolerable disease burden of 3 5 10 6 dalys pppy which is close to the threshold of 10 6 dalys pppy applied for drinking water 2 3 2 exposure assessment for modelling infection risks for the two irrigation and 14 incidence scenarios we use the weekly incidence and the model selected in section 3 2 to generate scenario predictions for nv concentrations for every week of every incidence scenario to this end we sample from the posterior predictive distribution ppd for every week during this period using the obtained parameter distributions from the simulated ppd the population distribution of the expected dose per exposure event is calculated by 14 d 10 c i n f l u e n t t 1 n l r v t v i n g e s t e d where d is the dose per exposure event cinfluent is the ppd of nov gii in lg gc l lrv is the log removal value for treatment step t n is the number of treatment steps and vingested is the ingested volume in l to isolate the effect of different annual irrigation periods we assume the remaining model inputs to be known without variation for the log reduction of the wastewater treatment plant before irrigation we run simulations for the range between 1 and 8 this allows to determine the sensitivity of derived risk indicators cf section 4 3 4 between scenarios as a function of the installed level of wastewater treatment for the volume ingested by fieldworkers vingested per exposure event via sprinkler irrigation and the frequency of exposure events we assume an ingestion of 0 1ml of treated wastewater to happen once a week this leads to 42 exposure events per year for the status quo scenario and 20 for the irrigation on demand scenario to assess the sensitivity of our result to these assumptions we additionally ran simulations for a a volume 1ml once per week b a volume of 0 1 twice per week in brief for risk simulation we follow the following algorithm 1 for each incidence scenario filter the scenario specific irrigation periods status quo irrigation on demand from the generated array of ppds 2 sample a random sample from each distribution of weekly nv gii simulation 42 for status quo 20 for irrigation on demand 3 for each sample apply the assumed log reduction and assumed volume per exposure event to estimate the dose per exposure event eq 14 4 calculate the infection probability per exposure event by applying the dose response of nov gii for disaggregated viruses cf section 0 eq 15 5 aggregate the calculated event probabilities into an estimate for the annual risk eq 16 and 6 repeat steps 2 5 for 1000 times to generate an uncertainty estimate for the average annual risk to further estimate the generated monte carlo error we repeated this simulation under the initial assumptions 0 1ml 1 week for 25 times 2 3 3 health effect assessment the dose response model for norovirus is subject of ongoing discussion until recently qmra studies which assessed the risk of norovirus infection relied on the dose response relation published by teunis et al 2008 which was simplified by messner et al 2014 and criticized to be highly uncertain and overly conservative for low concentrations by schmidt 2015 the dose response model was derived only for norovirus of genogroup i so that subsequent qmra studies had to make the inherent assumption that this dose response relationship would apply for all norovirus genogroups and genotypes a summary of the discussion and practical recommendations was provided by van abel et al 2017 recently teunis et al 2020 summarized the information from challenge studies and outbreaks using a bayesian hierarchical modelling approach to derive an updated generalized dose response relationship for norovirus of genogroups i and ii using the secretor status of the exposed person as an additional predictor variable we consider the latter study as the most comprehensive study on this topic so far so that we base our risk estimate on the parameters reported there we also chose this study as it provides specific estimates for the dose response parameters for nov gii which our study focuses on the dose repose model is based on gene copies which is in line with the data measured at the wwtp as secretor negative se persons are widely protected against norovirus infections we focus our analysis secretor positive people and assume all fieldworkers to be se thus we calculate the population distribution of risk outcomes per exposure event as the probability of infection pinf from the population distribution of simulated doses d by 15 p inf exposure 1 1 f 1 a a b d as parameter values we use the median of their posterior distributions as reported in table a13 of teunis et al 2020 namely a 0 23 and b 5 04 for solving the confluent hypergeometric function we use the function hyperg 1f of the gsl package of the r programming language we aggregate the individual event probabilities pi pn to an estimate of the annual infection risk pannual by 16 p a n n u a l 1 i 1 n 1 p inf exposure i 2 3 4 risk characterization to characterize the risk we assess both the statistical and practical significance of the obtained results to assess whether the difference between the simulated risk distributions are statistically significant we derive a bayesian p value from the simulated average annual risk to this end the average risk distributions for the status quo scenario are subtracted from the distribution of the irrigation of demand scenario for each incidence scenario the proportion of samples of the resulting difference distribution 0 is used as an approximation for the probability of the two distributions coming from the same underlying population if the calculated probability is 0 05 the two distributions are considered statistically different since we simulated 1000 annual risk samples of for each incidence scenario the lower limit for this approach is 0 001 which is sufficiently low for an assessment of the practical significance we calculate the risk ratio and log difference in risk between scenarios for each incidence scenario and each applied log removal 14 r i s k r a t i o r i s k a n n u a l s t a t u s q u o r i s k a n n u a l i r r i g a t i o n o n d e m a n d this corresponds to the differences in risk assuming the same level of wastewater treatment for both irrigation scenarios additionally we deduce the log removal needed to obtain the same level of health protection given the applied exposure scenario for each scenario the required log removal for achieving a value pinf 1 is deduced by linear interpolation between of the closest points of the discrete evaluations of the resulting risk function in the range 1 8 lrv subsequently the difference between scenarios is calculated as measure of additional health benefit due to changes in irrigation patterns 3 results the results of the initial quality control are shown in fig 1 a in the si from the data no obvious trends in the development of reported norovirus incidence can be determined which would indicate an underlying systematic effect instead peaks of norovirus outbreaks during the winter months reoccur annually with differences in amplitude the quality check for data completeness revealed complete datasets from 2009 2019 2001 2003 and to a lesser extent 2004 and 2005 showed relevant data gaps and were removed the years 2006 2 missing 2007 2008 1 missing each stayed within acceptable limits 3 1 descriptive analysis fig 1 shows the distribution of weekly reported norovirus of incidence in the district of braunschweig from 2006 2019 incidences show a pronounced seasonality they start rising in early winter around weeks 47 48 december and reach maxima during weeks 1 8 january february lower numbers of reported cases during week 52 are considered artifacts caused by christmas and new year s vacations results show that during winter the median incidence varies between 4 and 7 per week single peak observations reach values of up to 37 in summer the reported incidence stays at lower numbers between 0 4 and 2 the peak incidences of 37 were reported outside both irrigation scenarios and thus do not affect risk calculations table 1 shows the raw nv measurements paired number of reported cases the incidence the rolling two week incidence the calculated pearson correlation factors the posterior mode of the distribution of the bayesian r² and the values for the calculated log predictive densities for the lognormal gamma and negative binomial regression respectively results show that during the sampling period between week 42 and 49 2014 an increase in both the incidence ranging from 0 37 to 6 7 and norovirus concentrations ranging from 104 3 107 gc l can be observed results show a strong positive correlation with a pearson correlation factor of 0 96 combined with the known causality between the number of infected people and norovirus wastewater concentration this observation provides support for the hypothesis that the variability of reported epidemiological provides information for generating plausible risk scenarios for the potential variability of wastewater concentrations 3 2 model selection regarding the candidate models the negative binomial approach indicates a slightly better higher elpd predictive performance than the lognormal and gamma approach since the negative binomial distribution is also the most logical choice for modeling over dispersed discrete data the negative binomial model is selected for simulating norovirus influent concentrations the models developed with the rolling 2 day mean performed slightly better than the models developed with the incidence reported in the same week although the difference is very small the negative binomial model based on the 2 day rolling mean incidence is used for subsequent estimations fig 1 d in the si shows model predictions against nv data 3 3 simulated influent concentrations results of the predicted weekly norovirus concentrations based on the mean 2 day rolling average incidence are shown in fig 2 results for the individual incidence scenarios are shown in the si the results show that following the dynamic of norovirus incidence the highest concentrations are expected to occur during winter week 48 12 prediction intervals cover peak concentrations of up to 109 genome copies per liter the highest measured concentration during the sampling period was 1 1 107 genome copies liter norovirus concentrations of up to 109 gc l have been reported for noroviruses in european wastewater treatment plants before eftim et al 2017 seis et al 2020 thus the upper range of expected unobserved observations is considered plausible and in line with existing knowledge about norovirus concentrations in wastewater average concentrations during the peak season are expected to lie at 107 gc l while during summer average concentrations are expected to lie 1 5 2 order of magnitude below with minima at 103 gc l in for scenario is06 and maxima at 106 e g in summer of scenario is14 3 4 annual risk for different irrigation scenarios fig 3 upper graph shows exemplarily the distribution of the average annual risk simulated for the two irrigation scenarios and 14 incidence scenarios assuming an installed pretreatment of 6 lrv the results indicate that within the same irrigation scenario result may vary by more than 1 order of magnitude for example with a lrv of 6 the mean annual risk of the status quo scenario ranges between 2 1 10 4 for is06 and 2 8 10 3 for is08 for the irrigation on demand scenario between 1 7 10 5 for is17 and 1 9 10 4 for is10 the minimum and maximum incidence scenarios do not correspond between irrigation scenarios because winter peaks dominating risk simulations under status quo conditions are cut off from the risk simulation in the irrigation on demand scenario this leads to different risk patterns fig 3 lower graph shows exemplarily the simulated annual risk as a function of the installed log removal for the incidence scenario is08 since the graphs from the individual incidence scenarios look very similar the remaining ones are provided in the si the calculated bayesian p values are statistically significant bayesian p value 0 001 for every single incidence scenario and installed pretreatment regarding the practical significance fig 5 shows that the effectiveness of a change in irrigation patterns depends on the installed pretreatment for the assumed exposure volume and frequency the calculated risk indicators risk ratio and log difference increase until the pre treatment reaches a value between 3 and 4 lrv and stay at an approximately constant level afterwards the sensitivity assay cf si fig 1 g 1 h reveals that the level of required pre treatment to reach stable conditions increases with the assumed exposure note however that once stable conditions are reached risk indicators between sensitivity scenarios stay within the margin of monte carlo error of the original exposure scenario this indicates that overall conclusions about the magnitude of expected differences ratios and thus the relevance of the inter and intra annual variability of nv remain valid against varying exposure assumptions lower risk indicators at lower pre treatment are caused by the fact that if the pretreatment is too low the simulated annual risk is very close to 1 for both scenarios if the constant level is reached the highest ratio is calculated for the is08 and is12 with risk ratios between 35 and 50 which corresponds to a log difference of 1 5 1 7 the lowest risk ratio and log difference is observed for is13 with values of 6 7 and 0 8 respectively the mean and median of the median log difference are 1 15 and 1 1 respectively making in it on average 10 15 times more likely to become infected under the status quo scenario in comparison to the irrigation on demand scenario once stable condition are reached regarding the required log removal to achieve the same level of health protection of 1 we calculate median lrv between 0 9 and 1 9 between incidence scenarios with a median of 1 2 lrv fig 4 note that while the absolute required lrv values increase with increasing exposure in the sensitivity assay the derived difference between irrigation scenarios stay within the monte carlo error and thus do not affect the overall conclusion of the analysis that means that the between year variability of the required treatment performance may be up to 1 order of magnitude and that an on average an additional order of magnitude can be achieved by adapting irrigation patterns to an irrigation in the demand scenario as a side note our results also illustrate the difference between statistical and practical significance as even the difference between scenarios at a pre treatment level of lrv equal to 1 is statistically significant while from a practical perspective this difference is irrelevant 4 discussion in the present study we used epidemiological data to assess the potential relevance of seasonal and between year variability of nv concentration in ww for risk assessment and management of fieldworkers in agriculture to this end we derived plausible risk scenarios from weekly incidence data on reported nv cases in the district of braunschweig several studies before confirmed both seasonal variations of nov gii concentrations as well as the positive correlations between wastewater concentrations and the number of reported nov gii cases incidence eftim et al 2017 hellmer et al 2014 huang et al 2022 kazama et al 2017 miura et al 2016 in previous studies the relation between pathogen concentrations in wastewater and incidence in the population was used to estimate the incidence in the population proposing that regular pathogen monitoring might function as an early warning system for diseases spreading in the population hellmer et al 2014 medema et al 2020 to the best of our knowledge our study is the first attempt to use this relationship to estimate the relevance of the between year variability of nv risk in water related qmra studies and eventually its potential practical implications regarding risk reduction potentials and performance requirements our results suggest that within and between year variability is likely to have a relevant impact on risk assessment results and thus should be considered a relevant factor to consider when evaluating local data for local qmra studies thereby our approach addresses a very common problem in qmra studies namely an assessment of the potential impact and relevance of the lack of multi year data for local risk management due to the low sample size n 7 of norovirus our own study has to be seen as a first attempt to use epidemiological data to estimate the relevance of inter annual variability of norovirus infections further validation of this approach with multi year data including seasonality on nv in wastewater versus reported nv infections is warranted low sample sizes are a common cause of uncertainty in qmra studies sales ortells et al 2015 based a risk estimate for nv from consumption of lettuce on a sample size similar to ours n 8 others based risk estimates on even smaller dataset e g amoueyan et al 2019 or mcbride et al 2013 n 4 complementing nov gii observations with additional information like long term reported incidence most likely leads to a more realistic estimate of the existing variability of nov gii risk in comparison to deriving input distribution for source water concentration solely from the data collected over a limited period of time using incidence to estimate variation of nov gii concentrations certainly constitutes an interesting alternative to only grouping norovirus data by season as seasons may be quite different as our results indicate in one of the single studies which measured nv over three years and correlated nv concentrations to reported agi cases kazama et al 2017 also found a significant positive correlation which indicates that correlations may hold for more than one year and gives some support for generating plausible risk scenarios from reported incidence therefore if epidemiological information is available it might be beneficial to check whether collected nv wastewater data come from a low average or high incidence year if data have been collected under low incidence conditions only an additional safety factor could be considered however our result also underline that there is a need for more long term monitoring data to better characterize the between year variability as a source of variation local multi year wastewater data are still the preferred source of information for risk assessment in comparison to deriving scenarios from epidemiological data and are also needed for further validating existing modelling approaches like ours in this context it is important to note that the relation i e regression parameters between wastewater concentrations and reported incidence cannot be transferred to other locations as reporting systems and practices may be different between countries even within germany the federal governmental structure of the reporting system makes the transfer of derived regression coefficients questionable next to inter annual variability we also assessed the practical relevance and the risk reduction potential of adapting irrigation periods to low incidence periods taking into account intra annual variations our results suggest that cutting off peak concentrations of nov gii from the exposure period may function as an additional effective risk reduction measure complementing wastewater treatment and disinfection however our result also indicate that depending on the exposure level a minimum level of wastewater treatment is necessary in order for this adaption to be most effective these results may be of practical importance because studies which aim at deriving required log reduction values may account for this additional source of variation moreover while our scenario is tailored to locations in moderate climates where irrigation is only partially necessary during the vegetation period the obtained results may also be relevant for seasonal adjustments of pre treatment options in cases where irrigation is applied all year e g greenhouses as well as for risk assessments in areas where water use is particularly seasonal like e g bathing water management note however that for risk management decisions other reference pathogens like protozoan and bacterial pathogens would need to be considered as well our study makes several simplifying assumptions and disregards several factors for example no consideration is given to a potential immune adaption of workers nov gii rapidly expresses new variants which affects immunity but might also affect infectivity indeed many of the peak incidence seasons can be linked to the occurrence of new variants of norovirus becoming dominant for example the high incidence in season 2007 2008 can be attributed the variant 2006b becoming the dominant norovirus variant another steep and early rise in germany is in winter 2016 is connected to a new recombinant variant gii p16 gii 2 niendorf et al 2017 the effect of new norovirus variants and immune adaption on risk calculations has not been explicitly addressed in water related qmra so far and remain subject of future research a further simplification in our study is that for isolating the effect of norovirus variation we assumed a constant treatment performance over the whole season however log removal of viruses via biological wastewater treatment may be affected by other factors like e g temperature both the under estimation of large outbreaks by the reporting system which pre dominantly occur in winter and the temperature effects are likely to further increase the calculated risk ratios as viruses are known the be more recalcitrant under cold conditions thus while our study already indicated the relevance of seasonal effects the true effect might be even more pronounced and should be considered in future research 5 conclusion risk scenarios derived from epidemiological data and nov gii wastewater concentrations indicate that between year variability is a relevant factor for assessing health risk resulting from nov gii exposure annual mean infection risk may vary by 1log between years under the same exposure scenario reducing irrigation to low incidence periods may reduce the risk infection 1log units given sufficient pre treatment the log removal to achieve the same level of health protection of 1 per period per year is at least 0 9 log between scenarios additional safety factors may be applied in future qmra studies to account for between year variability the predictive power and wider use of epidemiological data as a suitable predictor variable should be

ammonia based aeration control enhanced biological phosphorus removal biological nutrient removal transcriptomics metabolomics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water resource recovery facilities wrrfs are necessarily at the forefront in protecting water resources and water quality in particular wrrfs must increasingly maximize removal of nutrients with an emphasis on nitrogen n and phosphorus p however wrrfs concurrently face challenges to reduce their energy usage environmental footprint and operational expenses with energy neutrality an ultimate goal fisher et al 2015a 2015b wrrf energy demands are indeed significant and primarily associated with aeration required to achieve nutrient removal municipal wastewater treatment consumes up to 3 4 of total electricity in the u s cornejo et al 2016 epa 2006 goldstein and smith 2002 pabi et al 2013 and electricity use accounts for 25 40 of wrrf operating budgets epa 2013 as nutrient removal requirements become more widespread energy demand will only increase from an environmental perspective energy related activities contribute the majority of greenhouse gas emissions in the u s epa 2021 commensurately wrrf energy demands are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions css 2013 a wrrf engineered to achieve biological nutrient removal bnr which targets removal of organic substrate phosphorus ammonia n and nitrate n generally exhibits the largest energy demands of all secondary treatment processes pabi et al 2013 specific to nitrogen removal in conventional bnr systems nh3 is aerobically oxidized to no3 while no3 is typically reduced via a pre anoxic configuration a process option to potentially conserve energy and reduce a wrrf environmental footprint involves partial oxidation of nh3 to no2 referred to as nitritation nitritation even accomplished partially theoretically can reduce wrrf energy demand through decreased aeration guo et al 2009 2008 zeng et al 2010 via lower dissolved oxygen do setpoints and reduced aeration period additionally considering that most muncipal wastewaters are organic carbon limited favorable thermodynamics of no2 as an electron acceptor over no3 daigger 2014 tchobanoglous et al 2014 can potentially reduce wrrf n2o emissions through more complete no3 no2 reduction to date nitritation has been applied principally to treat sidestreams rich in ammonia e g anaerobic digester centrate as a necessity to support the anammox anaerobic ammonia oxidation process li et al 2018 however interest has logically evolved to integrate nitritation into mainstream wastewater treatment as a means to both reduce wrrf energy demands and support mainstream anammox laureni et al 2015 2016 regmi et al 2014 2015a 2015b 2016 wang et al 2016 regardless of the application the implicit challenge is sustaining nitritation i e stopping ammonia oxidation at nitrite over complete nitrification nitrification to nitrate as contrasted with sidestream treatment this challenge is made much more difficult when integrated into mainstream treatment associated with the variabilities in flow ammonia load temperature etc li et al 2018 nevertheless some success at bench and pilot scale has been realized laureni et al 2015 2016 regmi et al 2014 2015a 2015b 2016 wang et al 2016 control of aeration period by monitoring ammonia removal and residual dissolved oxygen do appears to be a potential viable method to sustain partial nitritation although operational criteria remain unrefined wang et al 2016 achieved 80 nitrite accumulation for approximately 128 days when do was controlled at a concentration of 0 3 0 8 mgo2 l reactor operations selected for nitrobacter spp over nitrospira spp conversely regmi et al 2015a controlling at a higher do 1 2 1 7 mgo2 l coupled with an aeration period 75 of total treatment period observed that an enrichment for nitrospira spp over nitrobacter spp resulted in complete nitrification over a 366 day experimental period however a shift toward nitrobacter spp increased nitritation similar to that observed by wang et al 2016 in a related study regmi et al 2014 applying cyclical aeration with do set at 1 6 mgo2 l found longer aeration periods up to 83 of total hydraulic residence time hrt selected for nitrospira spp over nitrobacter spp with limited no2 accumulation both regmi et al studies also controlled aeration period using real time ammonia control with target ammonia removal turning off aeration liu and wang 2013 applied do conditions 0 5 mgo2 l comparable to that of wang et al 2016 but similar to the work of regmi et al reactors were enriched for nitrospira spp over nitrobacter spp with no no2 accumulation however solids residence times srts were very long up to 40 d along with full aeration and no real time ammonia control in summary research indicates that partial nitritation in a mainstream wrrf can potentially be sustained as follows i enrich for nitrobacter spp over nitrospira spp through ii maintaining a do aeration period couple based on iii real time monitoring of bulk solution ammonia although nitrobacter spp exhibit potentially high specific nitrite oxidation kinetics kim and kim 2006 their nitrite oxidation rates are impaired when operating under lower do conditions laureni et al 2016 which concurrently reduces wrrf aeration demands another argument supporting enrichment of nitrobacter spp over nitrospira spp to sustain nitration is the discovery of nitrospira spp capable of commamox daims et al 2015 2016 van kessel et al 2015 i e the presence of nitrospira spp capable of complete nitrification would render nitritation a moot point nevertheless potential explanations aimed at understanding functionally at a molecular level how a nitrobacter spp can sustain partial nitritation remain elusive research described and detailed herein was undertaken to better understand how a nitrobacter spp enrichment could metabolically achieve partial nitritation four real wastewater fed laboratory reactors were studied two were operated under strictly aerobic conditions while two were operated to achieve bnr reactor performance and nitritation was assessed based on monitoring bulk solution nitrogen concentrations the mixed microbial consortia were interrogated at a molecular level to quantify the relative fractions of nitrobacter spp and nitrospira spp present and describe key metabolic processes through targeted transcriptomics and metabolomics collectively this multi faceted approach has provided new insight into partial nitritation with a nitrobacter spp enrichment 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor operation two bench scale 2 l aerobic bioreactors identified as nf and nt were operated for 167 days with

mass of the four metabolites quantified 3 results 3 1 overall nitrification and nitritation performance monitoring nitrogen cycling and removal performance for reactors nf and nt started on operational day 2 over the operational period assessed the influent nh3 n concentration did vary for nf and nt as summarized in table s1 and as shown in fig 1 a and 1b this outcome was expected given that real wastewater was used to conduct these investigations however the variability was not significant and an interrogation of the reactor performance did not indicate any impact from the variability once nitrification and or nitritation was observed to be established day 75 for nf day 59 for nt effluent nh3 n concentration was 5 9 10 2 n 29 and 8 6 12 2 n 34 mgn l for nf and nt respectively overall nf and nt averaged 85 3 and 78 9 nh3 n removal once nitrification was established fig 1a and 1b show nitrogen cycling influent effluent for the full operational period as shown once ammonia oxidation was established both reactors nf and nt experienced varying degrees of nitritation reactor nf sustained significant nitritation after ammonia oxidation commenced the measured nitrite accumulation ratio nar no2 no2 no3 was 66 9 7 8 n 15 from operational day 100 137 conversely reactor nt exhibited some nitritation shortly after ammonia oxidation was achieved operational days 94 101 28 48 but nitrification quickly dominated reactor nf generally exhibited a negative nitrogen balance i e more nitrogen measured in the effluent vs influent as nox nh3 table 1 likely due to total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn not being quantified conversely reactor nt exhibited a positive nitrogen balance likely associated with simultaneous nitrification denitrification in the low do environment for reactors bp px1 and px2 nitrogen cycling data for the month wherein molecular interrogations presented and discussed herein occurred is shown in fig 1c and 1d for the three months prior the influent nh3 n effluent nh3 n effluent no2 n effluent no3 n and nar for px1 were 32 7 8 1 mgn l n 9 1 83 0 86 mgn l n 34 2 64 3 46 mgn l n 34 2 43 2 71 mgn l n 34 and 71 87 29 37 n 348 bp px2

interrogation of the performance data did not indicate any adverse effects from using real wastewater that exhibited some variability in characteristics regarding nar as described nitrate and nitrite were monitored in real time using a uv probe while bp px1 maintained a very high nar ranging from 80 to nearly 100 over the study period presented on day 12 the nar dropped substantially for an operational cycle a review of the data indicates the probe was potentially and temporarily impacted by debris near the end of one operational cycle the nitrite reading dipped below 1 mgn l for about 20 min resulting in the low nar there was no corresponding increase in nitrate this aberration in measurements ultimately skewed the nar for this operational cycle on day 12 prior and subsequent cycles did not exhibit the same nitrite aberration with the nar 80 regarding bp px2 note that the nar declined substantially in during the month of detailed evaluation as compared to the three months prior both reactors also exhibited some unaccounted for nitrogen table 1 3 2 sbr cycle evaluations nitrogen cycling ammonia nitrate and nitrite nitrogen concentrations within the nf and nt reactors were monitored over a complete sbr operational cycle on five and four operational days respectively fig 2 a 2e present observed bulk solution nitrogen concentrations and nitrite accumulation ratio nar for reactor nf additionally data collected allowed for a nitrogen balance evaluation results are presented in table 1 as shown the microbial consortia in reactor nf exhibited excellent ammonia removal and a high nar for operational days 113 119 and 138 fig 2a 2c moreover ammonia removal kinetics improved substantially over this operational period with complete oxidation shifting from approximately 300 min into the cycle to approximately 120 min for these same operational days the nar ranged from 63 8 to 66 4 however by operational day 145 fig 2d nitritation seemingly failed while the ammonia oxidation kinetics were similar to that observed on operational days 119 and 138 nitrite was depleted by the end of the sbr cycle considering the nitrogen balance table 1 on three operational days 119 145 and 169 near closure was observed on operational day 113 approximately 52 of the nitrogen measured at time zero could not be accounted for over the operational cycle in other words accounting for observed nox reduction and presumed tkn hydrolysis at the beginning of the cycle and some nox reduction toward the end of the cycle 9 76 mgn l was lost conversely on operational day 138 approximately 20 more nitrogen was accounted for over the operational cycle vs concentrations at time zero the most plausible explanation for lost nitrogen is simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd while raw wastewater tkn hydrolysis is a likely source of produced nitrogen in contrast to reactor nf the mixed microbial consortia in reactor nt ultimately only achieved nitrification fig 3 a 3d as shown excellent ammonia removal was observed with aob kinetics similar to that observed in reactor nf however end of cycle nar was essentially zero for all assessed operational days the nitrogen balance did not close with a relative significant amount of unaccounted for nitrogen 14 58 table 1 given the low operating do of reactor nt 0 5 mg l clearly snd occurred reactors bp px1 and px2 were designed and operated to achieve nitrogen and phosphorus removal in a post anoxic mode with internal carbon reserves associated with enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr driving nox reduction as shown fig 4 a table 1 and as discussed above the mixed microbial consortium mmc in bp px1 exhibited excellent ammonia removal with a very high nar effluent total nitrogen was 3 3 mgn l comparatively the mmc in bp px2 exhibited similar ammonia oxidation albeit abac control required an extra 26 min of aeration time however the nar was much lower than observed in px1 effluent total nitrogen was 11 3 mgn l the nitrogen balance did not close for px1 likely due to some snd while good closure was observed with px2 both reactors were operated to achieve ebpr p cycling followed ebpr theory and was consistent with prior observations coats et al 2011 winkler et al 2011 data not shown with effluent po4 concentrations of 0 17 px1 and 0 19 px2 mgp l 3 3 quantitation of nitrogen oxidizing bacteria qpcr techniques were performed on biomass recovered for each operational date to estimate the relative fraction of aob nitrobacter spp and nitrospira spp results are summarized in table 2 presented as percentages of total eubacteria quantified from the respective biomass samples bioreactor vss data is also provided to estimate the mass of nitrobacter spp and nitrospira spp in the respective reactors as shown the nob fraction varied across time in the nf and nt reactors generally increasing with operational day as the nob fraction increased the fraction of nitrobacter spp decreased comparatively biomass in the bp reactors was almost 100 nitrobacter spp while the nob fraction was low relative to nf and nt although the relative fraction of aob were below detection limit bdl clearly ammonia oxidation was occurring as evidenced by the data discussed and presented herein a central challenge in quantifying aob in complex environmental samples and in particular wrrf biomass is species diversity purkhold et al 2000 and the associated lack of a single universal primer set for aob orschler et al 2020 the primer set for aob employed in this study rotthauwe et al 1997 is generally considered the most universal of developed aob primer sets orschler et al 2020 although the primer pair remains imperfect and perhaps may not always target the most prominent aob present in wrrfs kim et al 2021 orschler et al 2020 in particular others have observed that nitrosomonas oligotropha like n europaea and or n eutropha aobs might be the most prominent aob in wrrf biomass harms et al 2003 kim et al 2021 orschler et al 2020 and the primer set applied in this study may not well capture these aob species preliminary investigations employing primer sets targeting these specific aob applied to biomass from the bp reactors resulted in similar bdl results data not shown while the amoa gene remains the preferred target for quantifying aob via qpcr it is understood that no one primer set and taqman probe can be applied to detect all aob orschler et al 2020 other potential qpcr detection issues include inhibitory substances present in the wastewater and low target concentrations harms et al 2003 kim et al 2013 ultimately the observation of ammonia oxidation was the primary research outcome of this study aob quantitation was secondary 3 4 nxr expression the two species of nob that have been identified by researchers to play vital roles in nitrite oxidation within wrrfs nitrobacter spp and nitrospira spp exhibit potentially important functional differences which may provide answers to nitritation specifically interrogation of two representative nob genomes for nitrobacter winogradskyi and nitrospira defluvii revealed differences in nitrite oxidoreductase nxr orientation and carbon metabolism nxr is a protein complex responsible for nitrite oxidation that is present in both nitrobacter spp and nitrospira spp however the oxidation site is oriented in opposite directions toward the cytoplasm for nitrobacter spp and towards the periplasm for nitrospira spp daims et al 2016 due to these differences nitrobacter spp must transport nitrite across the cell membrane prior to oxidation and nitrate back across upon completion of oxidation this suggests that nitrospira spp may be energetically advantaged in terms of nitrite oxidation and subsequent nitrate production thereby confounding nitritation a limited investigation on nxr expression was performed on the mmc in reactor nf samples were collected in five minute intervals for the first 15 min of the aerobic period for operational days 138 nitritation occurring and 145 loss of nitritation relative expressions of nitrobacter spp and nitrospira spp nxr subunits and corresponding bulk solution concentrations of nitrate and nitrite are illustrated in fig 5 a and 5b nxr expression by the mmc in the bp reactors was comprehensively assessed over the full operational cycle results are presented in fig 5c and 5d nitrobacter spp nxrb was the only subunit to be expressed for all timepoints nitrospira spp nxrbq subunit expression was detected at all timepoints for px1 but variably detected for px2 nitrobacter spp nxra was detected nominally on a few occasions in both reactors but not at a concentration that would be visible in the figures 3 5 nitritation carbon metabolomics nitrobacter spp and nitrospira spp exhibit unique lithotrophic carbon fixation metabolisms based on available full genomes nitrospira defluvii employ the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle rtca while nitrobacter winogradskyi employ the calvin benson cycle cbc lücker et al 2010 assuming these metabolic features apply generally to nitrobacter spp and nitrospira spp provides an opportunity to monitor relative metabolic activity of the two nobs during nitritation vs nitrification potentially amplifying corroborating interpretations of qpcr data metabolite profiling targeting the cbc and rtca cycle was performed for five reactor nf operational cycles four reactor nt operational cycles and one operational cycle each for reactors bp px1 and bp px2 results from these analyses are presented in figs 6 8 4 discussion macro and molecular level interrogations of mixed microbial consortia performing nitrification and nitritation provided unique insights into ammonia oxidation nitrification and nitritation the discussion below interrogates the discrete data sets presented above to interpret potential initiation and control mechanisms to achieve partial nitritation in mainstream wastewater treatment in the subsequent discussion specific sampling events will be referred to using the event scheme shown in table 1 interpretation of molecular data considers and builds upon performance inferences drawn from bulk solution nitrogen speciation interpretations 4 1 nitritation nitrobacter nitrospira or both nitrobacter spp are r strategists low affinity for no2 and o2 while nitrospira spp are k strategists high affinity for no2 and o2 tchobanoglous et al 2014 recognizing the implicit challenge in complete wrrf nob washout an initial review of data indicated that perhaps an nob population dominated by r strategists could singularly facilitate partial nitritation in wrrfs however results suggest that simply achieving a nitrobacter spp dominated nob population is insufficient to achieve partial nitritation table 3 as shown in figs s1 and s2 there was no correlation between the relative fraction of nitrobacter spp nitrospira spp nor nob with nar at one extreme n1 1 table 3 a near washout of nitrospira spp aligned with an nar of 81 7 conversely n2 1 exhibited a similar washout but the nar was only 11 2 the events that yielded the top four nar table 3 had a nitrobacter spp fraction ranging from 28 5 to 99 6 while an enrichment of 49 8 corresponded with an nar of 0 14 while nob speciation did not well align with high or low nar results do seem to indicate that a low nob fraction corresponded with an increased nar fig s2 which of course aligns with nitritation theory cao et al 2017 regmi et al 2014 although ultimately the data set is too limited to draw significant conclusions some preliminary insight on achieving near nob washout can be drawn from the bp px reactors specifically nitrobacter spp dominated the nobs in px1 and px2 with near complete nitrospira spp washout this outcome may be attributed to the post anoxic configuration coupled with unique metabolic capabilities of nitrobacter spp considering the model organisms nitrobacter winogradskyi codes for phb biosynthesis i e can grow mixotrophically whereas nitrospira defluvii may not exhibit similar metabolic capabilities karp et al 2015 if nitrobacter spp store phb in the anaerobic period they would be advantaged over nitrospira spp in the subsequent aerobic and post anoxic periods thus nitrobacter spp dominance might be important to achieving partial nitritation albeit perhaps more as an indicator vs functionally nevertheless enrichment of nitrobacter spp alone clearly was insufficient to sustain partial nitritation as evidenced by poor nar in px2 although as detailed above prior to the period of investigation herein px2 had maintained a nar of nearly 65 commensurate with a nitrobacter spp enrichment ultimately more research is necessary to pursue the potential linkage between post anoxic ebpr nitrobacter spp dominance near nob washout and partial nitritation 4 2 nitrification events nt 3 and nt 4 represent complete nitrification in that no nitrite accumulation was observed as indicated by bulk solution results fig 3c 3d the only nitrite measured was carry over from the prior operational cycle with reduction occurring relatively rapidly the nob fraction in the respective biomass was dominated by nitrospira spp 85 4 and 87 2 respectively table 2 metabolite data over the operational cycle reinforces that nitrospira spp dominate the mmc fig 7c 7d in that nominal cbc activity was detected considering the rtca metabolites the data suggests the pathway was active over the sbr operational cycle for event nt 3 the rer indicates succinate cycling to akg and then to citrate between 10 and 180 min corresponding well with nitrification metabolite data for event nt 4 is more difficult to interpret the consistently low concentrations of citrate could be interpreted as rtca activity however succinate akg appear to oscillate in rer over time potentially indicating both otca and rtca activity events nf 5 nt 1 and nt 2 exhibited nearly complete nitrification as well with nominal nitrite accumulation for the first two operational hours of the cycle figs 2e 3a 3b nitrospira spp dominated the mmc during event nf 5 90 3 commensurately almost no cbc metabolic activity was observed fig 6e early in the operational cycle up to 60 min it appears that rtca activity dominated with akg cycling to citrate across timepoints in contrast for events nt 1 and nt 2 nitrospira spp and nitrobacter spp were present at a 1 1 5 and 1 1 ratios respectively commensurate with the nitrobacter spp enrichment cbc activity was significant nt 1 to dominant nt 2 for the first 90 min of the operational cycles fig 7a 7b concurrent with observed nitrite accumulation and near complete ammonia oxidation fig 3a 3b thereafter greater tca metabolite rer was observed although the data indicates the cbc continued to be active of the nitrifying events nf 4 provides some critical insight into partial nitritation nf 4 exhibited a similar nitrogen profile as event nt 2 figs 2d vs 3b however nitrospira spp were more dominant 73 9 vs 50 2 commensurately nominal cbc activity was observed fig 6d and the metabolite rer analysis suggests rtca activity fig 6d regarding nitrification vs nitritation nf 4 occurred only one week after nf 3 which realized significant nitritation nar of 64 7 nf 3 vs 0 7 nf 4 the buildup of effluent nitrite in nf over the operational period from nf 1 to nf 4 and the carryover into the subsequent aerobic period of the next operational cycle appears to have favored enrichment of and nitrite oxidation by nitrospira spp as evidenced both by the qpcr and metabolite data indeed the nitrospira spp fraction of nobs and the overall nob fraction increased substantially from nf 1 to nf 5 with nitritation ultimately lost by nf 4 table 2 these results indicate that partial nitritation will be impaired unless significant nox reduction occurs prior to the aerobic period this observation aligns with conclusions of lemaire et al 2008 who observed that nitrite accumulation could be achieved through strict ammonia control through aeration period control followed by nitrite reduction in a post aerobic period 4 3 nitritation events nf 1 nf 2 and nf 3 and especially nf 2 and nf 3 in terms of nitrite concentration all exhibited significant nitritation fig 2a 2c with nar values exceeding 63 table 1 operationally these three events indicate sustained nitritation over a period of 25 days as shown in fig 1a nitritation was sustained for at least 37 days nar of 66 89 7 8 n 15 while nitrobacter spp was generally observed to be a greater fraction of the nob population as compared to the nitrification events discussed nitrospira spp were still relatively significant table 2 however metabolic data consistently indicated nitrobacter spp activity in particular event nf 2 effectively indicated no nitrospira spp metabolic activity moreover of the nf events nf 2 was the most successful nitritation event with an nar of 66 4 comparing metabolic profiles across the three events indicates reduced cbc activity by event nf 3 the nitrobacter spp population similarly decreased substantially by event nf 3 table 3 as noted nitritation was ultimately deteriorated by event nf 4 one week after event nf 3 for all these nitritating nf events the observed performance is somewhat surprising considering the operational do setpoint 2 0 mg o2 l in theory a lower do setpoint would be required to induce nitritation cao et al 2017 regmi et al 2014 but the nitrobacter spp dominance over nitrospira spp appears to have been an important factor in process performance 4 4 nitrification denitrification vs nitritation denitritation events n2 1 and n1 1 provide additional structure function insight to nitrification vs nitritation unlike the other nitrifying events the mmc were instead enriched with nitrobacter spp at almost 100 table 2 the metabolite data fig 8 similarly indicates a nitrobacter spp enrichment as evidenced by the presence of 3pg note that the tca data in fig 8 presumably reflects otca activity since there were no nitrospira spp present maximal nitritation was observed during event n1 1 with 81 7 nar realized at the end of the aerobic period this result was not an anomaly as this bioreactor maintained a consistently high nar over several months discussed above see also fig 1c principle differences between n1 1 and n2 1 were i operating do with n1 at 1 5 mgo2 l and n2 at 0 5 mgo2 l and ii some nox carryover from the anaerobic to the aerobic period regarding the latter as noted lemaire et al 2008 observed that nitrite accumulation could be achieved by minimizing nob substrate at the beginning of the aerobic period as shown fig 4b some nox was observed at the beginning of the aerobic period for n2 however the former issue low operating do likely contributed more to the observed nitritation differences specifically snd was likely occurring potentially substantially at the low do in n2 snd is accomplished in the presence of anoxic micro environments daigger and littleton 2014 the metabolite data fig 8 does suggest that nitrobacter spp was more metabolically active in n2 vs n1 particularly after the first hour of the aerobic period the nar appeared to decrease at approximately the same time fig 4b 4 5 toward a partial nitritation explanation coupling nxr expression results with qpcr and metabolite results provides a more complete interrogation of nitrification and partial nitritation transcriptomic investigations focused on a partial investigation of reactor nf and a deeper evaluation of the bp px reactors first considering the nf events transcriptomic data for nf 3 fig 5a achieving partial nitritation revealed a dominance of nxra and nxrb relative expression i e nitrite oxidoreductase associated with nitrobacter spp with lower stable or decreasing nxrbq relative expression i e nitrite oxidoreductase associated with nitrospira spp conversely nf 4 no nitritation revealed negligible nitrobacter spp nxra or nxrb expression and nitrospira spp nxrbq relative expression increasing over time fig 5b although the nob structure function in nf 3 could seemingly achieve nitrite oxidation the nobs most metabolically active nitrobacter spp were a small fraction of the nobs table 3 conversely the dominant nobs in nf 3 nitrospira spp were functionally less active and it could be inferred they were not contributing significantly to nitrite oxidation for nf 4 which achieved nitrification the relative fraction of nitrobacter spp was comparable to nf 3 however nitrobacter spp were minimally active both in terms of nxr expression fig 5b and carbon metabolisms fig 6d nitrospira spp nxr expression appeared to be increasing with time commensurately nitrite accumulation and nar was markedly reduced in nf 4 collectively the data indicates metabolically active nitrobacter spp even if not the dominant nob contributes to partial nitritation conversely a mmc dominated by nitrospira spp that is also nxr active appears to impair nitritation a deeper transcriptomics interrogation of bp px1 and px2 provided further insight into the potential relationships between nob speciation nxr expression and partial nitritation as discussed the mmc in bp px1 experienced significant nitritation over an extended duration for the operational cycle assessed 81 7 nar transcriptomic analysis of the nitrite oxidoreductase protein complex associated with nitrobacter spp did not detect the expression of nxra fig 5c the rate of nxrb relative expression began to increase 15 min into the aerobic period but with nitrite accumulation occurring concurrently however the potential lack of nxra could explain partial nitritation nxra is responsible for binding nitrite to initiate its oxidation daims et al 2016 pester et al 2014 alternately nxr associated with nitrobacter spp is a reversible protein capable of reducing nitrate to nitrite using organic carbon electrons starkenburg et al the dominance of nitrobacter spp could be potentially explained based on kinetic selection as r strategists nitrobacter spp will be enriched over nitrospira spp k strategists under higher nitrite concentrations daims et al 2016 and bp px1 sustained high nitrite concentrations over several months in contrast to bp px1 the mmc in px2 experienced a low nar 11 2 regarding nxr nxrb relative expression was markedly lower as compared to px1 fig 5d vs 5c even though the relative fraction of nitrobacter spp was higher in px2 table 2 while nitrite accumulation was low similar to px1 the rer for nxrb did increase during nitrite accumulation surprisingly given that almost no nitrospira spp were detected the relative expression of nxrbq was significant particularly later during the aerobic period the expression of nxrbq cannot be readily explained but could explain the reduced nar ultimately nxr expression may have been impaired by snd that likely occurred in px2 which was operated at a very low do of 0 5 mg l nitrobacter spp exhibit a higher growth rate under higher do concentrations as contrasted with nitrospira spp huang et al 2010 park et al 2017 a higher growth rate would allow for imposing a shorter aerobic srt in bnr systems which would also suppress proliferation of slower growing nitrospira spp regarding ammonia oxidation abac allows for the maintenance of a relatively high ammonia residual which can allow aob to sustain high ammonia oxidation rates i e higher nitrite production rates tchobanoglous et al 2014 finally nob experience enzymatic lag at the beginning of the aerobic period when preceded by anoxic anaerobic perturbances kornaros et al 2010 combined the result would be an increase in the bulk solution concentration of nitrite wherein nitrobacter spp i e an r strategist would be kinetically favored over nitrospira spp i e a k strategist tchobanoglous et al 2014 leveraging these fundamentals the operational conditions applied in this study specifically for the bp px1 reactor which was operated at a do of 1 5mgo2 l and under abac control to minimize the aerobic srt and maintain higher bulk solution ammonia concentrations ultimately appeared to favor nitrobacter spp growth over nitrospira spp these operational conditions also appeared to allow for aob ammonia oxidation rates to exceed nitrite oxidation rates resulting in the nitrite accumulation observed in the aerobic phase while we cannot discount a contribution of nitrite to the accumulated nitrite pool from simultaneous nitrification denitrification sndn by heterotrophic denitrifiers the applied do would generally not favor sndn additionally as a further metabolic advantage for growth nitrobacter spp can utilize nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor in the absence of oxygen bock et al 1988 freitag et al 1987 the post anoxic ebpr configuration always exhibited some nitrate residual after the aerobic period 5 conclusions research was conducted on bench scale wastewater treatment systems performing nitritation and nitrification to gain a better understanding and potential explanation on how mixed microbial consortia cultured on real wastewater can sustain partial nitritation differing bnr configurations were operated to achieve nitrite accumulation ratios of 64 82 with excellent overall effluent quality through analysis of nitrogen speciation qpcr data targeting nitrobacter spp and nitrospira spp transcriptomic data targeting nitrobacter spp and nitrospira spp nitrite oxidoreductase expression and metabolomic data targeting inorganic carbon pathways results indicate that partial nitritation within mainstream bnr may be induced and sustained through a combination of the following employ abac with an ammonia setpoint of 2 3 mgn l maintain a do of 1 0 2 0 mg l during the aerobic period and operate post anoxically possibly integrated within ebpr enriching for nitrobacter spp over nitrospira spp also appears critical but perhaps is more an outcome of the applied operational strategy in that a nitrobacter spp enrichment also corresponded with a low nob in partial nitritation partial even significant nitritation can nonetheless be achieved despite the presence nitrobacter spp but nitrite oxidoreductase must be functionally impaired or structurally incomplete overall this research demonstrated the value of interrogating a mixed microbial consortia at a macro and molecular level using structure function techniques to explore unique

water resource recovery facilities wrrfs are necessarily at the forefront in protecting water resources and water quality in particular wrrfs must increasingly maximize removal of nutrients with an emphasis on nitrogen n and phosphorus p however wrrfs concurrently face challenges to reduce their energy usage environmental footprint and operational expenses with energy neutrality an ultimate goal fisher et al 2015a 2015b wrrf energy demands are indeed significant and primarily associated with aeration required to achieve nutrient removal municipal wastewater treatment consumes up to 3 4 of total electricity in the u s cornejo et al 2016 epa 2006 goldstein and smith 2002 pabi et al 2013 and electricity use accounts for 25 40 of wrrf operating budgets epa 2013 as nutrient removal requirements become more widespread energy demand will only increase from an environmental perspective energy related activities contribute the majority of greenhouse gas emissions in the u s epa 2021 commensurately wrrf energy demands are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions css 2013 a wrrf engineered to achieve biological nutrient removal bnr which targets removal of organic substrate phosphorus ammonia n and nitrate n generally exhibits the largest energy demands of all secondary treatment processes pabi et al 2013 specific to nitrogen removal in conventional bnr systems nh3 is aerobically oxidized to no3 while no3 is typically reduced via a pre anoxic configuration a process option to potentially conserve energy and reduce a wrrf environmental footprint involves partial oxidation of nh3 to no2 referred to as nitritation nitritation even accomplished partially theoretically can reduce wrrf energy demand through decreased aeration guo et al 2009 2008 zeng et al 2010 via lower dissolved oxygen do setpoints and reduced aeration period additionally considering that most muncipal wastewaters are organic carbon limited favorable thermodynamics of no2 as an electron acceptor over no3 daigger 2014 tchobanoglous et al 2014 can potentially reduce wrrf n2o emissions through more complete no3 no2 reduction to date nitritation has been applied principally to treat sidestreams rich in ammonia e g anaerobic digester centrate as a necessity to support the anammox anaerobic ammonia oxidation process li et al 2018 however interest has logically evolved to integrate nitritation into mainstream wastewater treatment as a means to both reduce wrrf energy demands and support mainstream anammox laureni et al 2015 2016 regmi et al 2014 2015a 2015b 2016 wang et al 2016 regardless of the application the implicit challenge is sustaining nitritation i e stopping ammonia oxidation at nitrite over complete nitrification nitrification to nitrate as contrasted with sidestream treatment this challenge is made much more difficult when integrated into mainstream treatment associated with the variabilities in flow ammonia load temperature etc li et al 2018 nevertheless some success at bench and pilot scale has been realized laureni et al 2015 2016 regmi et al 2014 2015a 2015b 2016 wang et al 2016 control of aeration period by monitoring ammonia removal and residual dissolved oxygen do appears to be a potential viable method to sustain partial nitritation although operational criteria remain unrefined wang et al 2016 achieved 80 nitrite accumulation for approximately 128 days when do was controlled at a concentration of 0 3 0 8 mgo2 l reactor operations selected for nitrobacter spp over nitrospira spp conversely regmi et al 2015a controlling at a higher do 1 2 1 7 mgo2 l coupled with an aeration period 75 of total treatment period observed that an enrichment for nitrospira spp over nitrobacter spp resulted in complete nitrification over a 366 day experimental period however a shift toward nitrobacter spp increased nitritation similar to that observed by wang et al 2016 in a related study regmi et al 2014 applying cyclical aeration with do set at 1 6 mgo2 l found longer aeration periods up to 83 of total hydraulic residence time hrt selected for nitrospira spp over nitrobacter spp with limited no2 accumulation both regmi et al studies also controlled aeration period using real time ammonia control with target ammonia removal turning off aeration liu and wang 2013 applied do conditions 0 5 mgo2 l comparable to that of wang et al 2016 but similar to the work of regmi et al reactors were enriched for nitrospira spp over nitrobacter spp with no no2 accumulation however solids residence times srts were very long up to 40 d along with full aeration and no real time ammonia control in summary research indicates that partial nitritation in a mainstream wrrf can potentially be sustained as follows i enrich for nitrobacter spp over nitrospira spp through ii maintaining a do aeration period couple based on iii real time monitoring of bulk solution ammonia although nitrobacter spp exhibit potentially high specific nitrite oxidation kinetics kim and kim 2006 their nitrite oxidation rates are impaired when operating under lower do conditions laureni et al 2016 which concurrently reduces wrrf aeration demands another argument supporting enrichment of nitrobacter spp over nitrospira spp to sustain nitration is the discovery of nitrospira spp capable of commamox daims et al 2015 2016 van kessel et al 2015 i e the presence of nitrospira spp capable of complete nitrification would render nitritation a moot point nevertheless potential explanations aimed at understanding functionally at a molecular level how a nitrobacter spp can sustain partial nitritation remain elusive research described and detailed herein was undertaken to better understand how a nitrobacter spp enrichment could metabolically achieve partial nitritation four real wastewater fed laboratory reactors were studied two were operated under strictly aerobic conditions while two were operated to achieve bnr reactor performance and nitritation was assessed based on monitoring bulk solution nitrogen concentrations the mixed microbial consortia were interrogated at a molecular level to quantify the relative fractions of nitrobacter spp and nitrospira spp present and describe key metabolic processes through targeted transcriptomics and metabolomics collectively this multi faceted approach has provided new insight into partial nitritation with a nitrobacter spp enrichment 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor operation two bench scale 2 l aerobic bioreactors identified as nf and nt were operated for 167 days with

benson cycle cbc 3 phospho d glycerate 3pg and reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle rtca succinate α ketoglutarate akg and citrate were identified and quantified from biomass samples to interpret the data metabolite concentrations at each timepoint were normalized to the concentration immediately after the operational cycle began t 5 min for reactors nf and nt t 1 min for reactors n1 and n2 thus indicating up or down regulation of a pathway over time i e relative expression ratio rer no additional data processing was performed for n1 and n2 rer results as nitrospira spp were not detected table 2 for reactors nf and nt to differentiate magnitudes of rer normalized metabolites for the cbc were multiplied by the nitrobacter spp mass fraction of nobs and normalized rtca metabolites were multiplied by nitrospira spp mass fraction of nobs table 2 thus data reflects both the relative fraction of each of the metabolites generated by the different nobs and the relative activity of the targeted metabolisms additionally considering that both nob species can also utilize the otca cycle and recognizing the possible redundancy of metabolites between the otca and rtca cycles tca metabolite quantities were normalized to the nitrobacter spp population as described above and then subtracted from the nitrospira spp normalized rtca metabolites this helped minimize double counting tca metabolites and is more representative of rtca relative expression in nitrospira spp to view re data collectively all re data at each timepoint were summed and presented as a percent of the total mass of the four metabolites quantified 3 results 3 1 overall nitrification and nitritation performance monitoring nitrogen cycling and removal performance for reactors nf and nt started on operational day 2 over the operational period assessed the influent nh3 n concentration did vary for nf and nt as summarized in table s1 and as shown in fig 1 a and 1b this outcome was expected given that real wastewater was used to conduct these investigations however the variability was not significant and an interrogation of the reactor performance did not indicate any impact from the variability once nitrification and or nitritation was observed to be established day 75 for nf day 59 for nt effluent nh3 n concentration was 5 9 10 2 n 29 and 8 6 12 2 n 34 mgn l for nf and nt respectively overall nf and nt averaged 85 3 and 78 9 nh3 n removal once nitrification was established fig 1a and 1b show nitrogen cycling influent effluent for the full operational period as shown once ammonia oxidation was established both reactors nf and nt experienced varying degrees of nitritation reactor nf sustained significant nitritation after ammonia oxidation commenced the measured nitrite accumulation ratio nar no2 no2 no3 was 66 9 7 8 n 15 from operational day 100 137 conversely reactor nt exhibited some nitritation shortly after ammonia oxidation was achieved operational days 94 101 28 48 but nitrification quickly dominated reactor nf generally exhibited a negative nitrogen balance i e more nitrogen measured in the effluent vs influent as nox nh3 table 1 likely due to total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn not being quantified conversely reactor nt exhibited a positive nitrogen balance likely associated with simultaneous nitrification denitrification in the low do environment for reactors bp px1 and px2 nitrogen cycling data for the month wherein molecular interrogations presented and discussed herein occurred is shown in fig 1c and 1d for the three months prior the influent nh3 n effluent nh3 n effluent no2 n effluent no3 n and nar for px1 were 32 7 8 1 mgn l n 9 1 83 0 86 mgn l n 34 2 64 3 46 mgn l n 34 2 43 2 71 mgn l n 34 and 71 87 29 37 n 348 bp px2

interrogation of the performance data did not indicate any adverse effects from using real wastewater that exhibited some variability in characteristics regarding nar as described nitrate and nitrite were monitored in real time using a uv probe while bp px1 maintained a very high nar ranging from 80 to nearly 100 over the study period presented on day 12 the nar dropped substantially for an operational cycle a review of the data indicates the probe was potentially and temporarily impacted by debris near the end of one operational cycle the nitrite reading dipped below 1 mgn l for about 20 min resulting in the low nar there was no corresponding increase in nitrate this aberration in measurements ultimately skewed the nar for this operational cycle on day 12 prior and subsequent cycles did not exhibit the same nitrite aberration with the nar 80 regarding bp px2 note that the nar declined substantially in during the month of detailed evaluation as compared to the three months prior both reactors also exhibited some unaccounted for nitrogen table 1 3 2 sbr cycle evaluations nitrogen cycling ammonia nitrate and nitrite nitrogen concentrations within the nf and nt reactors were monitored over a complete sbr operational cycle on five and four operational days respectively fig 2 a 2e present observed bulk solution nitrogen concentrations and nitrite accumulation ratio nar for reactor nf additionally data collected allowed for a nitrogen balance evaluation results are presented in table 1 as shown the microbial consortia in reactor nf exhibited excellent ammonia removal and a high nar for operational days 113 119 and 138 fig 2a 2c moreover ammonia removal kinetics improved substantially over this operational period with complete oxidation shifting from approximately 300 min into the cycle to approximately 120 min for these same operational days the nar ranged from 63 8 to 66 4 however by operational day 145 fig 2d nitritation seemingly failed while the ammonia oxidation kinetics were similar to that observed on operational days 119 and 138 nitrite was depleted by the end of the sbr cycle considering the nitrogen balance table 1 on three operational days 119 145 and 169 near closure was observed on operational day 113 approximately 52 of the nitrogen measured at time zero could not be accounted for over the operational cycle in other words accounting for observed nox reduction and presumed tkn hydrolysis at the beginning of the cycle and some nox reduction toward the end of the cycle 9 76 mgn l was lost conversely on operational day 138 approximately 20 more nitrogen was accounted for over the operational cycle vs concentrations at time zero the most plausible explanation for lost nitrogen is simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd while raw wastewater tkn hydrolysis is a likely source of produced nitrogen in contrast to reactor nf the mixed microbial consortia in reactor nt ultimately only achieved nitrification fig 3 a 3d as shown excellent ammonia removal was observed with aob kinetics similar to that observed in reactor nf however end of cycle nar was essentially zero for all assessed operational days the nitrogen balance did not close with a relative significant amount of unaccounted for nitrogen 14 58 table 1 given the low operating do of reactor nt 0 5 mg l clearly snd occurred reactors bp px1 and px2 were designed and operated to achieve nitrogen and phosphorus removal in a post anoxic mode with internal carbon reserves associated with enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr driving nox reduction as shown fig 4 a table 1 and as discussed above the mixed microbial consortium mmc in bp px1 exhibited excellent ammonia removal with a very high nar effluent total nitrogen was 3 3 mgn l comparatively the mmc in bp px2 exhibited similar ammonia oxidation albeit abac control required an extra 26 min of aeration time however the nar was much lower than observed in px1 effluent total nitrogen was 11 3 mgn l the nitrogen balance did not close for px1 likely due to some snd while good closure was observed with px2 both reactors were operated to achieve ebpr p cycling followed ebpr theory and was consistent with prior observations coats et al 2011 winkler et al 2011 data not shown with effluent po4 concentrations of 0 17 px1 and 0 19 px2 mgp l 3 3 quantitation of nitrogen oxidizing bacteria qpcr techniques were performed on biomass recovered for each operational date to estimate the relative fraction of aob nitrobacter spp and nitrospira spp results are summarized in table 2 presented as percentages of total eubacteria quantified from the respective biomass samples bioreactor vss data is also provided to estimate the mass of nitrobacter spp and nitrospira spp in the respective reactors as shown the nob fraction varied across time in the nf and nt reactors generally increasing with operational day as the nob fraction increased the fraction of nitrobacter spp decreased comparatively biomass in the bp reactors was almost 100 nitrobacter spp while the nob fraction was low relative to nf and nt although the relative fraction of aob were below detection limit bdl clearly ammonia oxidation was occurring as evidenced by the data discussed and presented herein a central challenge in quantifying aob in complex environmental samples and in particular wrrf biomass is species diversity purkhold et al 2000 and the associated lack of a single universal primer set for aob orschler et al 2020 the primer set for aob employed in this study rotthauwe et al 1997 is generally considered the most universal of developed aob primer sets orschler et al 2020 although the primer pair remains imperfect and perhaps may not always target the most prominent aob present in wrrfs kim et al 2021 orschler et al 2020 in particular others have observed that nitrosomonas oligotropha like n europaea and or n eutropha aobs might be the most prominent aob in wrrf biomass harms et al 2003 kim et al 2021 orschler et al 2020 and the primer set applied in this study may not well capture these aob species preliminary investigations employing primer sets targeting these specific aob applied to biomass from the bp reactors resulted in similar bdl results data not shown while the amoa gene remains the preferred target for quantifying aob via qpcr it is understood that no one primer set and taqman probe can be applied to detect all aob orschler et al 2020 other potential qpcr detection issues include inhibitory substances present in the wastewater and low target concentrations harms et al 2003 kim et al 2013 ultimately the observation of ammonia oxidation was the primary research outcome of this study aob quantitation was secondary 3 4 nxr expression the two species of nob that have been identified by researchers to play vital roles in nitrite oxidation within wrrfs nitrobacter spp and nitrospira spp exhibit potentially important functional differences which may provide answers to nitritation specifically interrogation of two representative nob genomes for nitrobacter winogradskyi and nitrospira defluvii revealed differences in nitrite oxidoreductase nxr orientation and carbon metabolism nxr is a protein complex responsible for nitrite oxidation that is present in both nitrobacter spp and nitrospira spp however the oxidation site is oriented in opposite directions toward the cytoplasm for nitrobacter spp and towards the periplasm for nitrospira spp daims et al 2016 due to these differences nitrobacter spp must transport nitrite across the cell membrane prior to oxidation and nitrate back across upon completion of oxidation this suggests that nitrospira spp may be energetically advantaged in terms of nitrite oxidation and subsequent nitrate production thereby confounding nitritation a limited investigation on nxr expression was performed on the mmc in reactor nf samples were collected in five minute intervals for the first 15 min of the aerobic period for operational days 138 nitritation occurring and 145 loss of nitritation relative expressions of nitrobacter spp and nitrospira spp nxr subunits and corresponding bulk solution concentrations of nitrate and nitrite are illustrated in fig 5 a and 5b nxr expression by the mmc in the bp reactors was comprehensively assessed over the full operational cycle results are presented in fig 5c and 5d nitrobacter spp nxrb was the only subunit to be expressed for all timepoints nitrospira spp nxrbq subunit expression was detected at all timepoints for px1 but variably detected for px2 nitrobacter spp nxra was detected nominally on a few occasions in both reactors but not at a concentration that would be visible in the figures 3 5 nitritation carbon metabolomics nitrobacter spp and nitrospira spp exhibit unique lithotrophic carbon fixation metabolisms based on available full genomes nitrospira defluvii employ the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle rtca while nitrobacter winogradskyi employ the calvin benson cycle cbc lücker et al 2010 assuming these metabolic features apply generally to nitrobacter spp and nitrospira spp provides an opportunity to monitor relative metabolic activity of the two nobs during nitritation vs nitrification potentially amplifying corroborating interpretations of qpcr data metabolite profiling targeting the cbc and rtca cycle was performed for five reactor nf operational cycles four reactor nt operational cycles and one operational cycle each for reactors bp px1 and bp px2 results from these analyses are presented in figs 6 8 4 discussion macro and molecular level interrogations of mixed microbial consortia performing nitrification and nitritation provided unique insights into ammonia oxidation nitrification and nitritation the discussion below interrogates the discrete data sets presented above to interpret potential initiation and control mechanisms to achieve partial nitritation in mainstream wastewater treatment in the subsequent discussion specific sampling events will be referred to using the event scheme shown in table 1 interpretation of molecular data considers and builds upon performance inferences drawn from bulk solution nitrogen speciation interpretations 4 1 nitritation nitrobacter nitrospira or both nitrobacter spp are r strategists low affinity for no2 and o2 while nitrospira spp are k strategists high affinity for no2 and o2 tchobanoglous et al 2014 recognizing the implicit challenge in complete wrrf nob washout an initial review of data indicated that perhaps an nob population dominated by r strategists could singularly facilitate partial nitritation in wrrfs however results suggest that simply achieving a nitrobacter spp dominated nob population is insufficient to achieve partial nitritation table 3 as shown in figs s1 and s2 there was no correlation between the relative fraction of nitrobacter spp nitrospira spp nor nob with nar at one extreme n1 1 table 3 a near washout of nitrospira spp aligned with an nar of 81 7 conversely n2 1 exhibited a similar washout but the nar was only 11 2 the events that yielded the top four nar table 3 had a nitrobacter spp fraction ranging from 28 5 to 99 6 while an enrichment of 49 8 corresponded with an nar of 0 14 while nob speciation did not well align with high or low nar results do seem to indicate that a low nob fraction corresponded with an increased nar fig s2 which of course aligns with nitritation theory cao et al 2017 regmi et al 2014 although ultimately the data set is too limited to draw significant conclusions some preliminary insight on achieving near nob washout can be drawn from the bp px reactors specifically nitrobacter spp dominated the nobs in px1 and px2 with near complete nitrospira spp washout this outcome may be attributed to the post anoxic configuration coupled with unique metabolic capabilities of nitrobacter spp considering the model organisms nitrobacter winogradskyi codes for phb biosynthesis i e can grow mixotrophically whereas nitrospira defluvii may not exhibit similar metabolic capabilities karp et al 2015 if nitrobacter spp store phb in the anaerobic period they would be advantaged over nitrospira spp in the subsequent aerobic and post anoxic periods thus nitrobacter spp dominance might be important to achieving partial nitritation albeit perhaps more as an indicator vs functionally nevertheless enrichment of nitrobacter spp alone clearly was insufficient to sustain partial nitritation as evidenced by poor nar in px2 although as detailed above prior to the period of investigation herein px2 had maintained a nar of nearly 65 commensurate with a nitrobacter spp enrichment ultimately more research is necessary to pursue the potential linkage between post anoxic ebpr nitrobacter spp dominance near nob washout and partial nitritation 4 2 nitrification events nt 3 and nt 4 represent complete nitrification in that no nitrite accumulation was observed as indicated by bulk solution results fig 3c 3d the only nitrite measured was carry over from the prior operational cycle with reduction occurring relatively rapidly the nob fraction in the respective biomass was dominated by nitrospira spp 85 4 and 87 2 respectively table 2 metabolite data over the operational cycle reinforces that nitrospira spp dominate the mmc fig 7c 7d in that nominal cbc activity was detected considering the rtca metabolites the data suggests the pathway was active over the sbr operational cycle for event nt 3 the rer indicates succinate cycling to akg and then to citrate between 10 and 180 min corresponding well with nitrification metabolite data for event nt 4 is more difficult to interpret the consistently low concentrations of citrate could be interpreted as rtca activity however succinate akg appear to oscillate in rer over time potentially indicating both otca and rtca activity events nf 5 nt 1 and nt 2 exhibited nearly complete nitrification as well with nominal nitrite accumulation for the first two operational hours of the cycle figs 2e 3a 3b nitrospira spp dominated the mmc during event nf 5 90 3 commensurately almost no cbc metabolic activity was observed fig 6e early in the operational cycle up to 60 min it appears that rtca activity dominated with akg cycling to citrate across timepoints in contrast for events nt 1 and nt 2 nitrospira spp and nitrobacter spp were present at a 1 1 5 and 1 1 ratios respectively commensurate with the nitrobacter spp enrichment cbc activity was significant nt 1 to dominant nt 2 for the first 90 min of the operational cycles fig 7a 7b concurrent with observed nitrite accumulation and near complete ammonia oxidation fig 3a 3b thereafter greater tca metabolite rer was observed although the data indicates the cbc continued to be active of the nitrifying events nf 4 provides some critical insight into partial nitritation nf 4 exhibited a similar nitrogen profile as event nt 2 figs 2d vs 3b however nitrospira spp were more dominant 73 9 vs 50 2 commensurately nominal cbc activity was observed fig 6d and the metabolite rer analysis suggests rtca activity fig 6d regarding nitrification vs nitritation nf 4 occurred only one week after nf 3 which realized significant nitritation nar of 64 7 nf 3 vs 0 7 nf 4 the buildup of effluent nitrite in nf over the operational period from nf 1 to nf 4 and the carryover into the subsequent aerobic period of the next operational cycle appears to have favored enrichment of and nitrite oxidation by nitrospira spp as evidenced both by the qpcr and metabolite data indeed the nitrospira spp fraction of nobs and the overall nob fraction increased substantially from nf 1 to nf 5 with nitritation ultimately lost by nf 4 table 2 these results indicate that partial nitritation will be impaired unless significant nox reduction occurs prior to the aerobic period this observation aligns with conclusions of lemaire et al 2008 who observed that nitrite accumulation could be achieved through strict ammonia control through aeration period control followed by nitrite reduction in a post aerobic period 4 3 nitritation events nf 1 nf 2 and nf 3 and especially nf 2 and nf 3 in terms of nitrite concentration all exhibited significant nitritation fig 2a 2c with nar values exceeding 63 table 1 operationally these three events indicate sustained nitritation over a period of 25 days as shown in fig 1a nitritation was sustained for at least 37 days nar of 66 89 7 8 n 15 while nitrobacter spp was generally observed to be a greater fraction of the nob population as compared to the nitrification events discussed nitrospira spp were still relatively significant table 2 however metabolic data consistently indicated nitrobacter spp activity in particular event nf 2 effectively indicated no nitrospira spp metabolic activity moreover of the nf events nf 2 was the most successful nitritation event with an nar of 66 4 comparing metabolic profiles across the three events indicates reduced cbc activity by event nf 3 the nitrobacter spp population similarly decreased substantially by event nf 3 table 3 as noted nitritation was ultimately deteriorated by event nf 4 one week after event nf 3 for all these nitritating nf events the observed performance is somewhat surprising considering the operational do setpoint 2 0 mg o2 l in theory a lower do setpoint would be required to induce nitritation cao et al 2017 regmi et al 2014 but the nitrobacter spp dominance over nitrospira spp appears to have been an important factor in process performance 4 4 nitrification denitrification vs nitritation denitritation events n2 1 and n1 1 provide additional structure function insight to nitrification vs nitritation unlike the other nitrifying events the mmc were instead enriched with nitrobacter spp at almost 100 table 2 the metabolite data fig 8 similarly indicates a nitrobacter spp enrichment as evidenced by the presence of 3pg note that the tca data in fig 8 presumably reflects otca activity since there were no nitrospira spp present maximal nitritation was observed during event n1 1 with 81 7 nar realized at the end of the aerobic period this result was not an anomaly as this bioreactor maintained a consistently high nar over several months discussed above see also fig 1c principle differences between n1 1 and n2 1 were i operating do with n1 at 1 5 mgo2 l and n2 at 0 5 mgo2 l and ii some nox carryover from the anaerobic to the aerobic period regarding the latter as noted lemaire et al 2008 observed that nitrite accumulation could be achieved by minimizing nob substrate at the beginning of the aerobic period as shown fig 4b some nox was observed at the beginning of the aerobic period for n2 however the former issue low operating do likely contributed more to the observed nitritation differences specifically snd was likely occurring potentially substantially at the low do in n2 snd is accomplished in the presence of anoxic micro environments daigger and littleton 2014 the metabolite data fig 8 does suggest that nitrobacter spp was more metabolically active in n2 vs n1 particularly after the first hour of the aerobic period the nar appeared to decrease at approximately the same time fig 4b 4 5 toward a partial nitritation explanation coupling nxr expression results with qpcr and metabolite results provides a more complete interrogation of nitrification and partial nitritation transcriptomic investigations focused on a partial investigation of reactor nf and a deeper evaluation of the bp px reactors first considering the nf events transcriptomic data for nf 3 fig 5a achieving partial nitritation revealed a dominance of nxra and nxrb relative expression i e nitrite oxidoreductase associated with nitrobacter spp with lower stable or decreasing nxrbq relative expression i e nitrite oxidoreductase associated with nitrospira spp conversely nf 4 no nitritation revealed negligible nitrobacter spp nxra or nxrb expression and nitrospira spp nxrbq relative expression increasing over time fig 5b although the nob structure function in nf 3 could seemingly achieve nitrite oxidation the nobs most metabolically active nitrobacter spp were a small fraction of the nobs table 3 conversely the dominant nobs in nf 3 nitrospira spp were functionally less active and it could be inferred they were not contributing significantly to nitrite oxidation for nf 4 which achieved nitrification the relative fraction of nitrobacter spp was comparable to nf 3 however nitrobacter spp were minimally active both in terms of nxr expression fig 5b and carbon metabolisms fig 6d nitrospira spp nxr expression appeared to be increasing with time commensurately nitrite accumulation and nar was markedly reduced in nf 4 collectively the data indicates metabolically active nitrobacter spp even if not the dominant nob contributes to partial nitritation conversely a mmc dominated by nitrospira spp that is also nxr active appears to impair nitritation a deeper transcriptomics interrogation of bp px1 and px2 provided further insight into the potential relationships between nob speciation nxr expression and partial nitritation as discussed the mmc in bp px1 experienced significant nitritation over an extended duration for the operational cycle assessed 81 7 nar transcriptomic analysis of the nitrite oxidoreductase protein complex associated with nitrobacter spp did not detect the expression of nxra fig 5c the rate of nxrb relative expression began to increase 15 min into the aerobic period but with nitrite accumulation occurring concurrently however the potential lack of nxra could explain partial nitritation nxra is responsible for binding nitrite to initiate its oxidation daims et al 2016 pester et al 2014 alternately nxr associated with nitrobacter spp is a reversible protein capable of reducing nitrate to nitrite using organic carbon electrons starkenburg et al the dominance of nitrobacter spp could be potentially explained based on kinetic selection as r strategists nitrobacter spp will be enriched over nitrospira spp k strategists under higher nitrite concentrations daims et al 2016 and bp px1 sustained high nitrite concentrations over several months in contrast to bp px1 the mmc in px2 experienced a low nar 11 2 regarding nxr nxrb relative expression was markedly lower as compared to px1 fig 5d vs 5c even though the relative fraction of nitrobacter spp was higher in px2 table 2 while nitrite accumulation was low similar to px1 the rer for nxrb did increase during nitrite accumulation surprisingly given that almost no nitrospira spp were detected the relative expression of nxrbq was significant particularly later during the aerobic period the expression of nxrbq cannot be readily explained but could explain the reduced nar ultimately nxr expression may have been impaired by snd that likely occurred in px2 which was operated at a very low do of 0 5 mg l nitrobacter spp exhibit a higher growth rate under higher do concentrations as contrasted with nitrospira spp huang et al 2010 park et al 2017 a higher growth rate would allow for imposing a shorter aerobic srt in bnr systems which would also suppress proliferation of slower growing nitrospira spp regarding ammonia oxidation abac allows for the maintenance of a relatively high ammonia residual which can allow aob to sustain high ammonia oxidation rates i e higher nitrite production rates tchobanoglous et al 2014 finally nob experience enzymatic lag at the beginning of the aerobic period when preceded by anoxic anaerobic perturbances kornaros et al 2010 combined the result would be an increase in the bulk solution concentration of nitrite wherein nitrobacter spp i e an r strategist would be kinetically favored over nitrospira spp i e a k strategist tchobanoglous et al 2014 leveraging these fundamentals the operational conditions applied in this study specifically for the bp px1 reactor which was operated at a do of 1 5mgo2 l and under abac control to minimize the aerobic srt and maintain higher bulk solution ammonia concentrations ultimately appeared to favor nitrobacter spp growth over nitrospira spp these operational conditions also appeared to allow for aob ammonia oxidation rates to exceed nitrite oxidation rates resulting in the nitrite accumulation observed in the aerobic phase while we cannot discount a contribution of nitrite to the accumulated nitrite pool from simultaneous nitrification denitrification sndn by heterotrophic denitrifiers the applied do would generally not favor sndn additionally as a further metabolic advantage for growth nitrobacter spp can utilize nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor in the absence of oxygen bock et al 1988 freitag et al 1987 the post anoxic ebpr configuration always exhibited some nitrate residual after the aerobic period 5 conclusions research was conducted on bench scale wastewater treatment systems performing nitritation and nitrification to gain a better understanding and potential explanation on how mixed microbial consortia cultured on real wastewater can sustain partial nitritation differing bnr configurations were operated to achieve nitrite accumulation ratios of 64 82 with excellent overall effluent quality through analysis of nitrogen speciation qpcr data targeting nitrobacter spp and nitrospira spp transcriptomic data targeting nitrobacter spp and nitrospira spp nitrite oxidoreductase expression and metabolomic data targeting inorganic carbon pathways results indicate that partial nitritation within mainstream bnr may be induced and sustained through a combination of the following employ abac with an ammonia setpoint of 2 3 mgn l maintain a do of 1 0 2 0 mg l during the aerobic period and operate post anoxically possibly integrated within ebpr enriching for nitrobacter spp over nitrospira spp also appears critical but perhaps is more an outcome of the applied operational strategy in that a nitrobacter spp enrichment also corresponded with a low nob in partial nitritation partial even significant nitritation can nonetheless be achieved despite the presence nitrobacter spp but nitrite oxidoreductase must be functionally impaired or structurally incomplete overall this research demonstrated the value of interrogating a mixed microbial consortia at a macro and molecular level using structure function techniques to explore unique

15523,dissolved organic matter dom a heterogeneous mixture of diverse compounds with different molecular weights is crucial for the lake carbon cycle the properties and concentration of dom in lakes are closely related to anthropogenic activities terrigenous input and phytoplankton growth thus the lake s trophic state along with the above factors has an important effect on dom we determined the dom sources and molecular composition in six lakes along a trophic gradient during and after phytoplankton bloom by combining optical techniques and the fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms cdom pools in eutrophic lakes may be more biologically refractory than in oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes molecular formulas of dom were positively correlated with the tsi trophic state index value r 2 0 73 with the nitrogen containing compounds chon being the most abundant formulas in all studied lakes eutrophication modified the molecular formulas of dom to have less cho and more heteroatom s containing compounds chos and chnos and this was the synactic result of the anthropogenic perturbation and phytoplankton proliferation in eutrophic lakes summer dom showed higher molecular lability than in autumn which was related to the seasonal phytoplankton community succession although the phytoplankton derived dom is highly bioavailable we detected a simpler and more fragile phytoplankton community ecosystem in autumn which may be accompanied by a lower phytoplankton production and metabolic activity therefore we concluded that the lake eutrophication increased the allochthonous dom accumulation along with sewage and nutrient input and subsequently increased its release with phytoplankton bloom eutrophication and phytoplankton growth are accompanied by more highly unsaturated compounds o3s o5s compounds and carboxylic rich alicyclic compounds crams which are the biotransformation product of phytoplankton derived dom eutrophication may be a potential source of refractory dom compounds for biodegradation and photodegradation our results can clarify the potential role of water organic matter in the future global carbon cycle processes considering the increasing worldwide eutrophication of inland waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter eutrophication trophic state phytoplankton lakes fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom one of the largest stores of carbon globally is vital in the biogeochemical cycles of natural waters with 90 of the total organic matter song et al 2019 as a major nutrient and carbon source dom plays an essential role in organismal metabolic activity in aquatic ecosystems but the excessive dom may enhance color of natural waters and chromophoric fraction of dom could block the sun s radiation from penetrating to reach deeper water shang et al 2022 song et al 2018 dom linked inherently to the global carbon biogeochemical cycles thus understanding the biogeochemistry of dom in natural waters is necessary and important for adapting and the tackling changing climate kellerman et al 2014 kim et al 2021 dom is an aggregation of different molecular weight compounds with diverse chemical structures whose composition and concentration variation largely depend on its source dom in aquatic environment originates from both allochthonous and autochthonous sources many environmental and natural factors such as the land use landscape hydrology condition all had influence on dom components and concentration kellerman et al 2014 shang et al 2022 wen et al 2019 2016 meanwhile studies have proven that anthropogenic changes in water quanlity strongly impacted the dom composition including eutrophication and brownish he et al 2022b kaal et al 2022 liu et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 eutrophication of lakes as one of the world s most serious environmental problems always exhibits excess nutrients excessive algal blooms and overall deterioration of water quality smith et al 2006 along with these processes considerable terrestrial dom could be transported to the lakes these processes could also affect the aquatic organisms and microbial activities further influencing the autochthonous dom derived from the phytoplankton and microbial metabolism he et al 2022b kawasaki et al 2013 zhou et al 2021 thus eutrophication is one of the most dominant controlling factors causing differences in the dom chemistry of lakes studies have proven that the protein like materials may originate from phytoplankton plant and microbial decomposition while the humic like component may depend on the external terrestrial inputs shang et al 2019 song et al 2019 zhang et al 2010 although no obvious relationships were established between eutrophication and the dom quality at the molecular level the spatio temporal changes in its quality and lability were observed along the trophic gradients in lakes liu et al 2022 suksomjit et al 2009 zhang et al 2018 however there are some contradictory views on the role of phytoplankton in dom compositions during the eutrophication of lakes one view is that phytoplankton mainly algae is expected to produce and release relatively high molecular weight and labile dom into the water environment liu et al 2019 while another view concluded that the dom released from the phytoplankton essentially contributed to the refractory organic matter aoki et al 2008 mangal et al 2016 therefore there is an urgent need to clarify the molecular level information of dom and determine its composition from different sources which may have varied cycling pathways wen et al 2021 although many studies have examined the chemical components of dom in natural water environments and some sources identification methods such as stable isotope and c n ratio analysis were used to track the dom sources for the further components analysis kendall et al 2001 wen et al 2020 fewer studies have clarified its composition at the molecular level with detailed information optical spectroscopy has mostly been utilized to investigate the chemical composition of dom till date however due to the complexity of dom this optical technique lacks high resolution to effectively decode its molecular composition additionally the optical properties of dom only focus on the optically active fractions of dom 1 chromophoric dom cdom and 2 fluorescent dom fdom and not the whole dom pool coble 1996 stedmon et al 2003 fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms is currently being used for high resolution exploration of the molecular level information of dom and it has been successfully applied in various environments such as rivers lakes reservoirs and oceans dutta majumdar et al 2017 gonsior et al 2011 mangal et al 2016 wen et al 2021 due to the high resolving power and mass accuracy ft icr ms has become a powerful tool in assessing sources of dom and its biogeochemical reactivity and bioavailability indirectly providing hints based on the molecular composition changes to infer the dom cycling process therefore dom compositions in inland water across large national scale regions could be parsed at the molecular level which is important to clarify the carbon cycling process in inland water environment harir et al 2022 mangal et al 2016 to clarify how the lake eutrophication and phytoplankton community affect the dom molecular composition in lakes we investigated dom along the trophic gradients based on optical spectroscopy and ft icr ms the primary objectives were to 1 compare dom sources in lakes across trophic gradients 2 clarify the effect of eutrophication on dom molecular composition and 3 examine the changes of autochthonous dom composition with phytoplankton community succession our study results should help characterize the contributions of the trophic status of lakes and phytoplankton community succession to dom and help understand the biogeochemical processes of dom in lake ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sampling and measurements the study collected lake water samples from six lakes in china including zhelin lake baipenzhu reservoir poyang lake wanlyu lake dongping lake and gaoyou lake they are in different climatic zones and their morphology are displayed in fig 1 with the more of their characteristics mentioned in the supporting materials table s1 the salinity of these lakes ranged from 0 01 to 0 65 and they are all fresh water lakes the sampling campaign was conducted twice in summer july and autumn october respectively in 2019 a total of 104 water samples at a depth of 0 1 0 3 m were collected we categorized all sampled lakes based on the modified carlson s trophic state index tsi into three types aizaki et al 1981 carlson 1977 two oligotrophic lakes zhelin lake and baipenzhu reservoir two mesotrophic lakes poyang lake and wanlyu lake and two eutrophic lakes dongping lake and gaoyou lake during the sampling period we measured some water quality parameters in situ including salinity psu water temperature c and ph using a portable multi parameter water quality analyzer ysi 6600 xylem analytics llc weilheim germany in addition secchi disk depth sdd at each sampling point was also measured and recorded using a black and white disk in situ in the laboratory we measured the dissolved organic carbon doc and chlorophyll a chl a concentrations song et al 2018b chl a was extracted from the filters using a 90 buffered acetone solution and the concentration was determined by spectrophotometry uv 2600 pc shimadzu corporation kyoto japan to calculate the tsi of lakes the total phosphorus tp concentrations of the sampling water were also measured according to a standard method the detailed information on doc measurement and tsi calculation are provided in the supporting materials 2 2 dom optical properties analysis cdom absorption was measured using a uv 2600 spectrophotometer the absorption coefficient at 254 nm acdom254 was used as a proxy to assess the dom optical absorption characteristics bricaud et al 1981 weishaar et al 2003 wen et al 2016 dom fluorescence was also measured by excitation emission matrix eem with parallel factor analysis parafac the parafac was applied to analyze the dom components by matlab r2016a mathworks usa with the domfluor toolbox www models life ku dk the fluorescence index fi freshness index β α and humification index hix were calculated based on the parafac results hix represented the humification degree of dom higher the degree of humification the better the biological stability and the longer the existence time in the environment huguet et al 2009 details about cdom absorption and eem parafac are mentioned in the supporting materials 2 3 molecular characterization using ft icr ms the dom molecular components in water samples collected from lakes were analyzed using a 9 4 t bruker apex ultra ft icr ms bruker daltonics germany equipped with a negative electron spray ionization esi source at the heavy oil processing laboratory china university of petroleum beijing a standard method was used for the analysis he et al 2020 and the detailed information is provided in the supporting materials the general process follows this order 1 filtration of the lake water 0 22

total molecular formula numbers molecular weight mww modified aromaticity index aiw molecular lability index mlbw and double bond equivalence dbew the subscript w stands for intensity weighted average were calculated based on the ft icr ms analysis results four groups of the final chemical formulas were in the analysis cho chon chos or chons molecular formulas were further assigned to the following groups sugars saturated fatty acids highly unsaturated compounds unsaturated aliphatic compounds peptide like formulas polyphenols o3s o5s black carbon and crams hertkorn et al 2006 seidel et al 2015 2 4 phytoplankton community structure analysis the phytoplankton identification in lake water samples was conducted in the laboratory all lake samples were analyzed in triplicate for reproducibility phytoplankton cells were counted under an inverted microscope as described previously brierley et al 2007 john et al 2003 phytoplankton identification and the cell counts of all taxa in lake water were performed by keleduo biotechnology co ltd wuhan china both the shannon diversity index h and the pielou s evenness index j were calculated for the phytoplankton community as described previously shannon 1948 yeon et al 2009 pareto lorenz evenness curves were plotted to evaluate the algal community evenness in different trophic lakes in summer and autumn lorenz 1905 according to the pareto principle the value of vertical axis was according to the 20 abscissa axis and was being used to interpret the pareto lorenz curves wittebolle et al 2008 the detailed procedures for the index h d j and pareto lorenz evenness curves analysis are shown in supporting materials 3 results 3 1 optical properties of dom in lakes with different trophic states the mean acdom254 value exhibited a significant difference between the different trophic lakes with the eutrophic lakes showing a higher acdom254 mean value than both mesotrophic and oligotrophic lakes in both summer and autumn fig 2 a p 0 05 there has a significant positive correlation between acdom254 and the lake tsi values fig s1 in all trophic state lakes the acdom254 value did not show a significant difference between summer and autumn fig 2a p 0 05 although there was no difference in suva254 values between the different trophic lakes all lakes showed a higher suva254 value in summer than in autumn fig s2a three dom components were identified via the eems parafac analysis including c1 ex em 250 nm 438 nm c2 ex em 230 nm 430 nm and c3 ex em 280 nm 325 nm c1 c2 and c3 components represented the humic like c peak the fulvic origin or the terrestrially derived humic like products and the tryptophan protein like products respectively coble 1996 stedmon et al 2003 in this study dom in lakes was all humic like dominant c1 fig 2b the total fluorescence intensity ft did not change regularly along with the change of the tsi value irrespective of the trophic state the ft in autumn was significantly higher than that of summer p 0 05 fig 2b in this study lakes with different trophic states all have lower hix values 2 11 5 12 of dom thereby indicating a weak humification hix 4 fi and β α were negatively related with the lake tsi fig 3 a but hix and tsi showed an positive relationship fig 3b in all six lakes the autumn fi and the β α of dom both showed a comparatively lower value than in summer fig s2b c 3 2 molecular composition of dom as determined by ft icr ms solid phase extracted dom for these lake water samples contained between 8239 and 11 117 molecular formulas and the weighted average molecular weight mw ranges from 371 to 397 da table 1 the molecular formulas of dom were positively correlated with the tsi value r 2 0 73 fig 4 a table s1 the dom in eutrophic lakes presented a higher number of molecular formulas 10 772 than in the meso and oligotrophic lakes 9746 and 8822 fig 4b in eutrophic lakes the summer samples showed a significantly higher averaged molecular lability index mlbl than the autumn samples p 0 05 in all trophic state lakes the nitrogen containing compounds chon the sum of chon1 chon2 and chon3 were the most abundant regarding weighted intensity with a high proportion of 41 42 followed by carbohydrates cho with the proportion of 29 39 fig 4b in eutrophic lakes these two compounds also showed an increasing trend from summer to autumn fig 5 a the cho and chon1 showed a decreasing trend with the serious trophic state whereas the other chemical formula groups in the dom showed the inverse trend fig s3 therefore crams were the most abundant group of all detected compounds in the lake water dom based on the detailed molecular formulas identified from ft icr ms this compound group displayed 4726 5455 and 6406 mean value assigned molecular formulas in the oligotrophic mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes respectively which corresponded to 69 71 by relative intensity sugars were the least abundant group which only accounted for 0 2 of all detected formulas fig 6 however there has a significant difference in both molecular groups between the summer and the autumn samples for the eutrophic lakes p 0 05 fig 5b we grouped the identified dom molecular components into three classes based on the carbon skeleton structure simanek 2006 and found that the carbocyclic compounds including crams polyphenols and black carbon were the major dom components in all trophic state lakes 75 79 the open chain compounds like sugars unsaturated aliphatics and saturated fatty acids were the following component of dom with the proportion of 7 13 while heterocyclic compounds occupied the lowest proportion in both the latter two compounds the proportion increased with the gradual deterioration of trophic state fig 6 additionally the relationship between the number of dom molecular groups and tsi showed that crams highly unsaturated group and o3s o5s were all positively correlated with the tsi fig s4 3 3 structure of phytoplankton community in lakes the greater the curve deviated from the theoretical perfect evenness line 45 diagonal the lesser phytoplankton community evenness was observed lorenz 1905 following this principle the phytoplankton community evenness in the lakes however did not show the distinct regularity changes with the lake trophic states fig 7 a the value of the vertical axis according to the 20 abscissa axis is often used to interpret the community evenness based on the pareto principle gao et al 2014 wittebolle et al 2008 we compared the cumulative abundances according to the 20 cumulative peak content between summer and autumn in the oligotrophic mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes the results showed that the autumn values were higher than summer in all trophic states fig 7b d the interpretation of the curve was that a smaller proportion of the species 20 within the phytoplankton community were dominant and showed high numbers in autumn in ecological terms the curve in autumn represented the phytoplankton community with lower evenness j 0 23 in the oligotrophic zhelin reservoir j 0 52 in the mesotrophic poyang lake and j 0 34 in the eutrophic gaoyou lake with the season changing from summer to autumn the phytoplankton community structure succession occurred in all the studied lakes fig s5 coupled with this population change the evenness index and shannon diversity index of the phytoplankton community all declined in the eutrophic lakes this phenomenon was also observed in the studied mesotrophic and oligotrophic lakes except the wanlyu lake a mesotrophic lake which had an unchanged dominant population cylindrospermopsis raciborskii of phytoplankton community in both summer and autumn fig s5 under the situation of the more simple and fragile phytoplankton community in autumn both fi and β α of dom also diminished in the studied lakes figs 8 and s2b c the mlbl of dom showed the same trend as fi and β α in the eutrophic lakes 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of dom sources in lakes across trophic gradients there was a noticeable seasonal difference of suva254 in all the studied lakes fig s2a the comparison of suva254 value indicated that the proportion of the input of terrigenous plants to the dom in summer was higher than in autumn spencer et al 2012 weishaar et al 2003 the aromatic moieties of cdom in autumn were lower than in summer spencer et al 2012 weishaar et al 2003 and this was further verified by the eems parafac analysis fig s6 meanwhile although dom fluorescence in these lakes waters was dominated by the humic like components the ft showed higher values in autumn which jointed with the lower suva254 thereby illustrating that the autochthonous dom in these lakes may have stronger fluorescence than the allochthonous components phytoplankton bloom in the lakes could increase the cdom fluorescence kwon et al 2018 suksomjit et al 2009 in addition the coordinated increase between acdom254 and trophic state was proposed in some lakes and reservoirs in china shang et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 and this positive correlation was confirmed again in this study fig s1 indicating that the cdom absorption might be used as the predictor of an inland water trophic state spencer et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 the positive relationships between tsi and hix demonstrated that the cdom from the allochthonous sources occupied a higher proportion in eutrophic lakes than in the mesotrophic and oligotrophic lakes with cdom pools in eutrophic lakes being more refractory to degradation than oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes this speculation was further verified by the negative relationship between tsi and fi or β α fig 3 this result was consistent with those of previous studies in reservoirs and plateau lakes shang et al 2019 zhang et al 2010 in eutrophic lakes along with the richly anthropogenic input of allochthonous dom from the watershed the watershed nutrients input accelerated the phytoplankton growth in lakes increasing dom including cdom release from phytoplankton degradation zhang et al 2009 2010 recent studies have suggested that most of the autochthonous cdom derived from phytoplankton degradation were the bio labile constituents like the peptide like constituent he et al 2022b zhou et al 2021 the production of the labile algal dom could have a positive priming effect thus increasing the heterotrophic microbe induced biodegradation of refractory dom bianchi 2011 kawasaki et al 2013 with bacterial degradation also contributing to the recalcitrant dom in eutrophic lakes kawasaki et al 2013 furthermore the dom derived from phytoplankton could aggregate and form the unstructured humic like cdom in the water environment based on both the cultural study and the field observations kinsey et al 2018 kwon et al 2018 4 2 effect of eutrophication on dom molecular composition numerous previous studies linking water trophic state to the dom fluorescent components have been reported in lakes reservoirs and rivers shang et al 2019 zhang et al 2010 but the fluorescent components of dom cannot provide the precise information on the biochemical structural changes of dom currently how dom composition changes at the molecular level along with the lake trophic gradients is still unknown lake eutrophication complicated the dom molecular structure without the adequate consideration of the seasonal variation liu et al 2022 it was suggested that eutrophication could increase the molecular lability of dom with a higher content of peptide and sugar like compounds in the river estuary transect he et al 2022b our study investigated the dom molecular level compositional changes along the trophic gradients in lakes during and after phytoplankton bloom summer and autumn eutrophication modifies the molecular formulas of dom to less cho and more heteroatom s containing compounds chos and chnos fig s3 table s1 studies have showed that the anthropogenic dom contained more heteroatom formulas than natural dom notably the presence of an unexpected amount of s containing molecular formulas in sewage gonsior et al 2011 lv et al 2017 eutrophication caused by anthropogenic sewage and nutrient inputs has been a dominant factor affecting the dom chemistry and components in natural water he et al 2022b furthermore accompanied by the anthropogenic eutrophication algal blooms in these eutrophic lakes contributed more dom during the accumulation and decomposition processes of phytoplankton with the abundant s containing compounds about 50 also being observed in the freshwater phytoplankton derived dom pool mangal et al 2016 therefore we speculated that the changed molecular composition of dom in the eutrophic lakes was the synactic result of anthropogenic perturbation and phytoplankton proliferation we detected detailed in the molecular compounds of dom greater abundance of crams highly unsaturated compounds and o3s o5s in the eutrophic lakes crams were the most abundant components of the refractory dom pool in the deep ocean studies have found that cram like dom compounds may not be directly generated by algae or phytoplankton but were the regeneration and transformation products via the microbial utilization and processing of the labile dom released from phytoplankton fuhrman and azam 1982 liu et al 2020 this development process of crams has been proven in an algae associated microbial culture experiment where crams were found to be more enriched in the later growth phase of algae with recalcitrant character he et al 2022a liu et al 2021b due to their resistance to microbial degradation cram compounds might accumulate and preserve in water since the phytoplankton growth is always closely related to the nutrient level in lakes crams therefore showed an increasing trend along the trophic state levels of the studied lakes fig 6 o3s and o5s compounds have been detected from dom samples in some anthropogenically perturbed waters including rivers reservoirs and lagoons linking to the anthropogenic sources gonsior et al 2016 melendez perez et al 2016 wang et al 2019 o3s compounds were likely associated with linear alkylbenzene sulfonates las while the o5s compounds were probably the aerobic degradation product sulfophenyl carboxylic acids of las las were added to personal care products and cleaning compounds as surfactants the o3s and o5s compounds increased significantly along the trophic state levels of fig 6 which suggested an increased level of anthropogenic perturbation in addition photochemical reactions also affected the dom molecular compositional variation in natural waters previous studies have shown that the unsaturated compounds in dom were preferentially photodegraded which dominated the phototransformation of dom dutta majumdar et al 2017 harir et al 2022 lake water clarity sdd controlled the depth of the lake s euphotic zone which would also affect the phototransformation of dom sdd decreased with the increased trophic state levels thus weakening the light penetration in the eutrophic lakes song et al 2021 consequently the highly unsaturated compounds may accumulate in water with the increasing trophic state levels due to the decreasing photochemical reactions 4 3 changes of autochthonous dom composition with phytoplankton community in the natural water ecosystem phytoplankton abundance rapidly changes with the changes in dom concentration liu et al 2021a and one study has showed that the phytoplankton derived dom accounted for as high as 40 60 of dom mangal et al 2016 dom derived from the phytoplankton in the laboratory pure culture was mainly dominated by the s containing molecules and protein molecules mangal et al 2016 with different phytoplankton taxonomic groups releasing different types of dom haraguchi et al 2019 yamada et al 2012 in this context the succession of phytoplankton community structure in lakes can potentially affect the dom composition but the correlation between them still remains unclear one major obstacle impeding our understanding of this correlation was the lack of research on the phytoplankton community succession in natural aquatic environments along with molecular level changes in the dom pool liu et al 2021a 2021b found that dom in a human impacted subtropical river controlled the phytoplankton community dynamics via the prominent effect of protein like components with their relationship changing with variations in the dom chemical composition zhao et al 2022 pointed out that the protein like component with the largest relative proportion 41 98 in dom was mainly affected by phytoplankton in the erhai lake however these studies were all based on spectroscopic techniques which are biased only towards the fluorescing component in dom which does not represent the whole dom pool suksomjit et al 2009 several studies which focused on the phytoplankton community and autochthonous dom characteristics relied only on the incubation experiment becker et al 2014 haraguchi et al 2019 mangal et al 2016 to the best of our knowledge our study is perhaps the first attempt to link the dom molecular level composition to the change of phytoplankton community in lakes over a large range of trophic gradients the only regret was that we did not detect the composition of the dominant phytoplankton derived dom during the community succession using the ft icr ms so we cannot present the direct correlation between algae species and molecular components with the seasons changing from summer to autumn there was a more simple and fragile phytoplankton community ecosystem in the studied lakes in the eutrophic lakes mlbl of the water dom also reduced along with phytoplankton community succession mlbl is used to estimate the overall lability of the dom with higher mlbl in summer indicating higher molecular lability of dom than in autumn this was consistent with the reduced fi and β α of cdom in the eutrophic lakes fig 8a and b indicating that both the biodegradability of cdom and the proportion of newly produced cdom decreased from summer to autumn the growth of phytoplankton and its biomass in autumn was lower than in summer in the lakes with a previous study concluding that the autochthonous dom which originated from the phytoplankton production and metabolic activity has greater bioavailability than humic dom therefore the phytoplankton derived dom is more likely to participate in the biogeochemical cycle of lake ecosystem liu et al 2019 which may be responsible for the higher molecular lability of dom in summer to clarify the molecular level changes of dom with the seasonal phytoplankton community succession we analyzed all molecular compounds which can be partly derived from the autochthonous sources including crams saturated fatty acids unsaturated aliphatics peptides and sugars cram percentage significantly increased during autumn which was commonly linked with refractory compounds being detected in diverse natural environments thereby suggesting that increasing cram may be responsible for the lower molecular lability of autumn dom other molecular formula percentages were all diminished in autumn fig 5 since they were already been proven to be biodegradable liu et al 2019 it is worth mentioning that in the studied mesotrophic and oligotrophic lakes although the fi and β α of water cdom decreased with the phytoplankton community succession from summer to autumn fig 8c and d the mlbl value of the whole dom pool did not show the same trend we speculated that since the phytoplankton derived dom occupied a lower percentage of the dom pool in both these lakes than in eutrophic lakes the phytoplankton community succession with the changing season weakly impacted the dom molecular characteristics the dom pool in the mesotrophic and oligotrophic lakes may be dominated and controlled by the allochthonous sources considering the phytoplankton in summer the dominant phytoplankton populations in all studied lakes were all chlorophyta when autumn came even though the dominant phytoplankton populations in the eutrophic lakes did not change but they changed to bacillariophyta in the poyang lake and cyanophyta in the other mesotrophic and oligotrophic lakes the succession of the dominant phytoplankton population may be responsible for the change of cdom composition which can also affect the phytoplankton biomass and community structure it is with regret that we only presented the discussion and data in summer and autumn in this study there has a large temperature difference between summer and winter and the influence of this environmental change on dom composition may be more remarkable in the further research the spring and winter would be considered this is very important to the whole season evaluation of dom biogeochemical cycle 5 conclusions the changes of dom components along with the trophic gradients and phytoplankton community succession in lakes are crucial for understanding the role of dom in aquatic biogeochemical cycles in the present study we used both eem parafac and ft icr ms to determine the molecular transformations of the water dom along with the trophic gradients and phytoplankton community succession in lakes our study provides evidence at the molecular level that eutrophication with the phytoplankton growth is vital in the generation of heteroatom s containing compounds we also found that the trophic state effectively influences the refractory dom components like crams and o3s o5s compounds with the results suggesting higher nutrient levels and greater accumulation of these refractory compounds the taxology of phytoplankton species directly influences the molecular composition of autochthonous dom phytoplankton community succession from summer to autumn could affect the molecular lability of dom with little effect on the highly bioavailable autochthonous dom considering the deteriorative eutrophication in lakes and the increased anthropogenic activities with the climate change in the future improving the understanding of dom changes with eutrophication

15523,dissolved organic matter dom a heterogeneous mixture of diverse compounds with different molecular weights is crucial for the lake carbon cycle the properties and concentration of dom in lakes are closely related to anthropogenic activities terrigenous input and phytoplankton growth thus the lake s trophic state along with the above factors has an important effect on dom we determined the dom sources and molecular composition in six lakes along a trophic gradient during and after phytoplankton bloom by combining optical techniques and the fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms cdom pools in eutrophic lakes may be more biologically refractory than in oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes molecular formulas of dom were positively correlated with the tsi trophic state index value r 2 0 73 with the nitrogen containing compounds chon being the most abundant formulas in all studied lakes eutrophication modified the molecular formulas of dom to have less cho and more heteroatom s containing compounds chos and chnos and this was the synactic result of the anthropogenic perturbation and phytoplankton proliferation in eutrophic lakes summer dom showed higher molecular lability than in autumn which was related to the seasonal phytoplankton community succession although the phytoplankton derived dom is highly bioavailable we detected a simpler and more fragile phytoplankton community ecosystem in autumn which may be accompanied by a lower phytoplankton production and metabolic activity therefore we concluded that the lake eutrophication increased the allochthonous dom accumulation along with sewage and nutrient input and subsequently increased its release with phytoplankton bloom eutrophication and phytoplankton growth are accompanied by more highly unsaturated compounds o3s o5s compounds and carboxylic rich alicyclic compounds crams which are the biotransformation product of phytoplankton derived dom eutrophication may be a potential source of refractory dom compounds for biodegradation and photodegradation our results can clarify the potential role of water organic matter in the future global carbon cycle processes considering the increasing worldwide eutrophication of inland waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter eutrophication trophic state phytoplankton lakes fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom one of the largest stores of carbon globally is vital in the biogeochemical cycles of natural waters with 90 of the total organic matter song et al 2019 as a major nutrient and carbon source dom plays an essential role in organismal metabolic activity in aquatic ecosystems but the excessive dom may enhance color of natural waters and chromophoric fraction of dom could block the sun s radiation from penetrating to reach deeper water shang et al 2022 song et al 2018 dom linked inherently to the global carbon biogeochemical cycles thus understanding the biogeochemistry of dom in natural waters is necessary and important for adapting and the tackling changing climate kellerman et al 2014 kim et al 2021 dom is an aggregation of different molecular weight compounds with diverse chemical structures whose composition and concentration variation largely depend on its source dom in aquatic environment originates from both allochthonous and autochthonous sources many environmental and natural factors such as the land use landscape hydrology condition all had influence on dom components and concentration kellerman et al 2014 shang et al 2022 wen et al 2019 2016 meanwhile studies have proven that anthropogenic changes in water quanlity strongly impacted the dom composition including eutrophication and brownish he et al 2022b kaal et al 2022 liu et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 eutrophication of lakes as one of the world s most serious environmental problems always exhibits excess nutrients excessive algal blooms and overall deterioration of water quality smith et al 2006 along with these processes considerable terrestrial dom could be transported to the lakes these processes could also affect the aquatic organisms and microbial activities further influencing the autochthonous dom derived from the phytoplankton and microbial metabolism he et al 2022b kawasaki et al 2013 zhou et al 2021 thus eutrophication is one of the most dominant controlling factors causing differences in the dom chemistry of lakes studies have proven that the protein like materials may originate from phytoplankton plant and microbial decomposition while the humic like component may depend on the external terrestrial inputs shang et al 2019 song et al 2019 zhang et al 2010 although no obvious relationships were established between eutrophication and the dom quality at the molecular level the spatio temporal changes in its quality and lability were observed along the trophic gradients in lakes liu et al 2022 suksomjit et al 2009 zhang et al 2018 however there are some contradictory views on the role of phytoplankton in dom compositions during the eutrophication of lakes one view is that phytoplankton mainly algae is expected to produce and release relatively high molecular weight and labile dom into the water environment liu et al 2019 while another view concluded that the dom released from the phytoplankton essentially contributed to the refractory organic matter aoki et al 2008 mangal et al 2016 therefore there is an urgent need to clarify the molecular level information of dom and determine its composition from different sources which may have varied cycling pathways wen et al 2021 although many studies have examined the chemical components of dom in natural water environments and some sources identification methods such as stable isotope and c n ratio analysis were used to track the dom sources for the further components analysis kendall et al 2001 wen et al 2020 fewer studies have clarified its composition at the molecular level with detailed information optical spectroscopy has mostly been utilized to investigate the chemical composition of dom till date however due to the complexity of dom this optical technique lacks high resolution to effectively decode its molecular composition additionally the optical properties of dom only focus on the optically active fractions of dom 1 chromophoric dom cdom and 2 fluorescent dom fdom and not the whole dom pool coble 1996 stedmon et al 2003 fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms is currently being used for high resolution exploration of the molecular level information of dom and it has been successfully applied in various environments such as rivers lakes reservoirs and oceans dutta majumdar et al 2017 gonsior et al 2011 mangal et al 2016 wen et al 2021 due to the high resolving power and mass accuracy ft icr ms has become a powerful tool in assessing sources of dom and its biogeochemical reactivity and bioavailability indirectly providing hints based on the molecular composition changes to infer the dom cycling process therefore dom compositions in inland water across large national scale regions could be parsed at the molecular level which is important to clarify the carbon cycling process in inland water environment harir et al 2022 mangal et al 2016 to clarify how the lake eutrophication and phytoplankton community affect the dom molecular composition in lakes we investigated dom along the trophic gradients based on optical spectroscopy and ft icr ms the primary objectives were to 1 compare dom sources in lakes across trophic gradients 2 clarify the effect of eutrophication on dom molecular composition and 3 examine the changes of autochthonous dom composition with phytoplankton community succession our study results should help characterize the contributions of the trophic status of lakes and phytoplankton community succession to dom and help understand the biogeochemical processes of dom in lake ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sampling and measurements the study collected lake water samples from six lakes in china including zhelin lake baipenzhu reservoir poyang lake wanlyu lake dongping lake and gaoyou lake they are in different climatic zones and their morphology are displayed in fig 1 with the more of their characteristics mentioned in the supporting materials table s1 the salinity of these lakes ranged from 0 01 to 0 65 and they are all fresh water lakes the sampling campaign was conducted twice in summer july and autumn october respectively in 2019 a total of 104 water samples at a depth of 0 1 0 3 m were collected we categorized all sampled lakes based on the modified carlson s trophic state index tsi into three types aizaki et al 1981 carlson 1977 two oligotrophic lakes zhelin lake and baipenzhu reservoir two mesotrophic lakes poyang lake and wanlyu lake and two eutrophic lakes dongping lake and gaoyou lake during the sampling period we measured some water quality parameters in situ including salinity psu water temperature c and ph using a portable multi parameter water quality analyzer ysi 6600 xylem analytics llc weilheim germany in addition secchi disk depth sdd at each sampling point was also measured and recorded using a black and white disk in situ in the laboratory we measured the dissolved organic carbon doc and chlorophyll a chl a concentrations song et al 2018b chl a was extracted from the filters using a 90 buffered acetone solution and the concentration was determined by spectrophotometry uv 2600 pc shimadzu corporation kyoto japan to calculate the tsi of lakes the total phosphorus tp concentrations of the sampling water were also measured according to a standard method the detailed information on doc measurement and tsi calculation are provided in the supporting materials 2 2 dom optical properties analysis cdom absorption was measured using a uv 2600 spectrophotometer the absorption coefficient at 254 nm acdom254 was used as a proxy to assess the dom optical absorption characteristics bricaud et al 1981 weishaar et al 2003 wen et al 2016 dom fluorescence was also measured by excitation emission matrix eem with parallel factor analysis parafac the parafac was applied to analyze the dom components by matlab r2016a mathworks usa with the domfluor toolbox www models life ku dk the fluorescence index fi freshness index β α and humification index hix were calculated based on the parafac results hix represented the humification degree of dom higher the degree of humification the better the biological stability and the longer the existence time in the environment huguet et al 2009 details about cdom absorption and eem parafac are mentioned in the supporting materials 2 3 molecular characterization using ft icr ms the dom molecular components in water samples collected from lakes were analyzed using a 9 4 t bruker apex ultra ft icr ms bruker daltonics germany equipped with a negative electron spray ionization esi source at the heavy oil processing laboratory china university of petroleum beijing a standard method was used for the analysis he et al 2020 and the detailed information is provided in the supporting materials the general process follows this order 1 filtration of the lake water 0 22

total molecular formula numbers molecular weight mww modified aromaticity index aiw molecular lability index mlbw and double bond equivalence dbew the subscript w stands for intensity weighted average were calculated based on the ft icr ms analysis results four groups of the final chemical formulas were in the analysis cho chon chos or chons molecular formulas were further assigned to the following groups sugars saturated fatty acids highly unsaturated compounds unsaturated aliphatic compounds peptide like formulas polyphenols o3s o5s black carbon and crams hertkorn et al 2006 seidel et al 2015 2 4 phytoplankton community structure analysis the phytoplankton identification in lake water samples was conducted in the laboratory all lake samples were analyzed in triplicate for reproducibility phytoplankton cells were counted under an inverted microscope as described previously brierley et al 2007 john et al 2003 phytoplankton identification and the cell counts of all taxa in lake water were performed by keleduo biotechnology co ltd wuhan china both the shannon diversity index h and the pielou s evenness index j were calculated for the phytoplankton community as described previously shannon 1948 yeon et al 2009 pareto lorenz evenness curves were plotted to evaluate the algal community evenness in different trophic lakes in summer and autumn lorenz 1905 according to the pareto principle the value of vertical axis was according to the 20 abscissa axis and was being used to interpret the pareto lorenz curves wittebolle et al 2008 the detailed procedures for the index h d j and pareto lorenz evenness curves analysis are shown in supporting materials 3 results 3 1 optical properties of dom in lakes with different trophic states the mean acdom254 value exhibited a significant difference between the different trophic lakes with the eutrophic lakes showing a higher acdom254 mean value than both mesotrophic and oligotrophic lakes in both summer and autumn fig 2 a p 0 05 there has a significant positive correlation between acdom254 and the lake tsi values fig s1 in all trophic state lakes the acdom254 value did not show a significant difference between summer and autumn fig 2a p 0 05 although there was no difference in suva254 values between the different trophic lakes all lakes showed a higher suva254 value in summer than in autumn fig s2a three dom components were identified via the eems parafac analysis including c1 ex em 250 nm 438 nm c2 ex em 230 nm 430 nm and c3 ex em 280 nm 325 nm c1 c2 and c3 components represented the humic like c peak the fulvic origin or the terrestrially derived humic like products and the tryptophan protein like products respectively coble 1996 stedmon et al 2003 in this study dom in lakes was all humic like dominant c1 fig 2b the total fluorescence intensity ft did not change regularly along with the change of the tsi value irrespective of the trophic state the ft in autumn was significantly higher than that of summer p 0 05 fig 2b in this study lakes with different trophic states all have lower hix values 2 11 5 12 of dom thereby indicating a weak humification hix 4 fi and β α were negatively related with the lake tsi fig 3 a but hix and tsi showed an positive relationship fig 3b in all six lakes the autumn fi and the β α of dom both showed a comparatively lower value than in summer fig s2b c 3 2 molecular composition of dom as determined by ft icr ms solid phase extracted dom for these lake water samples contained between 8239 and 11 117 molecular formulas and the weighted average molecular weight mw ranges from 371 to 397 da table 1 the molecular formulas of dom were positively correlated with the tsi value r 2 0 73 fig 4 a table s1 the dom in eutrophic lakes presented a higher number of molecular formulas 10 772 than in the meso and oligotrophic lakes 9746 and 8822 fig 4b in eutrophic lakes the summer samples showed a significantly higher averaged molecular lability index mlbl than the autumn samples p 0 05 in all trophic state lakes the nitrogen containing compounds chon the sum of chon1 chon2 and chon3 were the most abundant regarding weighted intensity with a high proportion of 41 42 followed by carbohydrates cho with the proportion of 29 39 fig 4b in eutrophic lakes these two compounds also showed an increasing trend from summer to autumn fig 5 a the cho and chon1 showed a decreasing trend with the serious trophic state whereas the other chemical formula groups in the dom showed the inverse trend fig s3 therefore crams were the most abundant group of all detected compounds in the lake water dom based on the detailed molecular formulas identified from ft icr ms this compound group displayed 4726 5455 and 6406 mean value assigned molecular formulas in the oligotrophic mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes respectively which corresponded to 69 71 by relative intensity sugars were the least abundant group which only accounted for 0 2 of all detected formulas fig 6 however there has a significant difference in both molecular groups between the summer and the autumn samples for the eutrophic lakes p 0 05 fig 5b we grouped the identified dom molecular components into three classes based on the carbon skeleton structure simanek 2006 and found that the carbocyclic compounds including crams polyphenols and black carbon were the major dom components in all trophic state lakes 75 79 the open chain compounds like sugars unsaturated aliphatics and saturated fatty acids were the following component of dom with the proportion of 7 13 while heterocyclic compounds occupied the lowest proportion in both the latter two compounds the proportion increased with the gradual deterioration of trophic state fig 6 additionally the relationship between the number of dom molecular groups and tsi showed that crams highly unsaturated group and o3s o5s were all positively correlated with the tsi fig s4 3 3 structure of phytoplankton community in lakes the greater the curve deviated from the theoretical perfect evenness line 45 diagonal the lesser phytoplankton community evenness was observed lorenz 1905 following this principle the phytoplankton community evenness in the lakes however did not show the distinct regularity changes with the lake trophic states fig 7 a the value of the vertical axis according to the 20 abscissa axis is often used to interpret the community evenness based on the pareto principle gao et al 2014 wittebolle et al 2008 we compared the cumulative abundances according to the 20 cumulative peak content between summer and autumn in the oligotrophic mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes the results showed that the autumn values were higher than summer in all trophic states fig 7b d the interpretation of the curve was that a smaller proportion of the species 20 within the phytoplankton community were dominant and showed high numbers in autumn in ecological terms the curve in autumn represented the phytoplankton community with lower evenness j 0 23 in the oligotrophic zhelin reservoir j 0 52 in the mesotrophic poyang lake and j 0 34 in the eutrophic gaoyou lake with the season changing from summer to autumn the phytoplankton community structure succession occurred in all the studied lakes fig s5 coupled with this population change the evenness index and shannon diversity index of the phytoplankton community all declined in the eutrophic lakes this phenomenon was also observed in the studied mesotrophic and oligotrophic lakes except the wanlyu lake a mesotrophic lake which had an unchanged dominant population cylindrospermopsis raciborskii of phytoplankton community in both summer and autumn fig s5 under the situation of the more simple and fragile phytoplankton community in autumn both fi and β α of dom also diminished in the studied lakes figs 8 and s2b c the mlbl of dom showed the same trend as fi and β α in the eutrophic lakes 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of dom sources in lakes across trophic gradients there was a noticeable seasonal difference of suva254 in all the studied lakes fig s2a the comparison of suva254 value indicated that the proportion of the input of terrigenous plants to the dom in summer was higher than in autumn spencer et al 2012 weishaar et al 2003 the aromatic moieties of cdom in autumn were lower than in summer spencer et al 2012 weishaar et al 2003 and this was further verified by the eems parafac analysis fig s6 meanwhile although dom fluorescence in these lakes waters was dominated by the humic like components the ft showed higher values in autumn which jointed with the lower suva254 thereby illustrating that the autochthonous dom in these lakes may have stronger fluorescence than the allochthonous components phytoplankton bloom in the lakes could increase the cdom fluorescence kwon et al 2018 suksomjit et al 2009 in addition the coordinated increase between acdom254 and trophic state was proposed in some lakes and reservoirs in china shang et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 and this positive correlation was confirmed again in this study fig s1 indicating that the cdom absorption might be used as the predictor of an inland water trophic state spencer et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 the positive relationships between tsi and hix demonstrated that the cdom from the allochthonous sources occupied a higher proportion in eutrophic lakes than in the mesotrophic and oligotrophic lakes with cdom pools in eutrophic lakes being more refractory to degradation than oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes this speculation was further verified by the negative relationship between tsi and fi or β α fig 3 this result was consistent with those of previous studies in reservoirs and plateau lakes shang et al 2019 zhang et al 2010 in eutrophic lakes along with the richly anthropogenic input of allochthonous dom from the watershed the watershed nutrients input accelerated the phytoplankton growth in lakes increasing dom including cdom release from phytoplankton degradation zhang et al 2009 2010 recent studies have suggested that most of the autochthonous cdom derived from phytoplankton degradation were the bio labile constituents like the peptide like constituent he et al 2022b zhou et al 2021 the production of the labile algal dom could have a positive priming effect thus increasing the heterotrophic microbe induced biodegradation of refractory dom bianchi 2011 kawasaki et al 2013 with bacterial degradation also contributing to the recalcitrant dom in eutrophic lakes kawasaki et al 2013 furthermore the dom derived from phytoplankton could aggregate and form the unstructured humic like cdom in the water environment based on both the cultural study and the field observations kinsey et al 2018 kwon et al 2018 4 2 effect of eutrophication on dom molecular composition numerous previous studies linking water trophic state to the dom fluorescent components have been reported in lakes reservoirs and rivers shang et al 2019 zhang et al 2010 but the fluorescent components of dom cannot provide the precise information on the biochemical structural changes of dom currently how dom composition changes at the molecular level along with the lake trophic gradients is still unknown lake eutrophication complicated the dom molecular structure without the adequate consideration of the seasonal variation liu et al 2022 it was suggested that eutrophication could increase the molecular lability of dom with a higher content of peptide and sugar like compounds in the river estuary transect he et al 2022b our study investigated the dom molecular level compositional changes along the trophic gradients in lakes during and after phytoplankton bloom summer and autumn eutrophication modifies the molecular formulas of dom to less cho and more heteroatom s containing compounds chos and chnos fig s3 table s1 studies have showed that the anthropogenic dom contained more heteroatom formulas than natural dom notably the presence of an unexpected amount of s containing molecular formulas in sewage gonsior et al 2011 lv et al 2017 eutrophication caused by anthropogenic sewage and nutrient inputs has been a dominant factor affecting the dom chemistry and components in natural water he et al 2022b furthermore accompanied by the anthropogenic eutrophication algal blooms in these eutrophic lakes contributed more dom during the accumulation and decomposition processes of phytoplankton with the abundant s containing compounds about 50 also being observed in the freshwater phytoplankton derived dom pool mangal et al 2016 therefore we speculated that the changed molecular composition of dom in the eutrophic lakes was the synactic result of anthropogenic perturbation and phytoplankton proliferation we detected detailed in the molecular compounds of dom greater abundance of crams highly unsaturated compounds and o3s o5s in the eutrophic lakes crams were the most abundant components of the refractory dom pool in the deep ocean studies have found that cram like dom compounds may not be directly generated by algae or phytoplankton but were the regeneration and transformation products via the microbial utilization and processing of the labile dom released from phytoplankton fuhrman and azam 1982 liu et al 2020 this development process of crams has been proven in an algae associated microbial culture experiment where crams were found to be more enriched in the later growth phase of algae with recalcitrant character he et al 2022a liu et al 2021b due to their resistance to microbial degradation cram compounds might accumulate and preserve in water since the phytoplankton growth is always closely related to the nutrient level in lakes crams therefore showed an increasing trend along the trophic state levels of the studied lakes fig 6 o3s and o5s compounds have been detected from dom samples in some anthropogenically perturbed waters including rivers reservoirs and lagoons linking to the anthropogenic sources gonsior et al 2016 melendez perez et al 2016 wang et al 2019 o3s compounds were likely associated with linear alkylbenzene sulfonates las while the o5s compounds were probably the aerobic degradation product sulfophenyl carboxylic acids of las las were added to personal care products and cleaning compounds as surfactants the o3s and o5s compounds increased significantly along the trophic state levels of fig 6 which suggested an increased level of anthropogenic perturbation in addition photochemical reactions also affected the dom molecular compositional variation in natural waters previous studies have shown that the unsaturated compounds in dom were preferentially photodegraded which dominated the phototransformation of dom dutta majumdar et al 2017 harir et al 2022 lake water clarity sdd controlled the depth of the lake s euphotic zone which would also affect the phototransformation of dom sdd decreased with the increased trophic state levels thus weakening the light penetration in the eutrophic lakes song et al 2021 consequently the highly unsaturated compounds may accumulate in water with the increasing trophic state levels due to the decreasing photochemical reactions 4 3 changes of autochthonous dom composition with phytoplankton community in the natural water ecosystem phytoplankton abundance rapidly changes with the changes in dom concentration liu et al 2021a and one study has showed that the phytoplankton derived dom accounted for as high as 40 60 of dom mangal et al 2016 dom derived from the phytoplankton in the laboratory pure culture was mainly dominated by the s containing molecules and protein molecules mangal et al 2016 with different phytoplankton taxonomic groups releasing different types of dom haraguchi et al 2019 yamada et al 2012 in this context the succession of phytoplankton community structure in lakes can potentially affect the dom composition but the correlation between them still remains unclear one major obstacle impeding our understanding of this correlation was the lack of research on the phytoplankton community succession in natural aquatic environments along with molecular level changes in the dom pool liu et al 2021a 2021b found that dom in a human impacted subtropical river controlled the phytoplankton community dynamics via the prominent effect of protein like components with their relationship changing with variations in the dom chemical composition zhao et al 2022 pointed out that the protein like component with the largest relative proportion 41 98 in dom was mainly affected by phytoplankton in the erhai lake however these studies were all based on spectroscopic techniques which are biased only towards the fluorescing component in dom which does not represent the whole dom pool suksomjit et al 2009 several studies which focused on the phytoplankton community and autochthonous dom characteristics relied only on the incubation experiment becker et al 2014 haraguchi et al 2019 mangal et al 2016 to the best of our knowledge our study is perhaps the first attempt to link the dom molecular level composition to the change of phytoplankton community in lakes over a large range of trophic gradients the only regret was that we did not detect the composition of the dominant phytoplankton derived dom during the community succession using the ft icr ms so we cannot present the direct correlation between algae species and molecular components with the seasons changing from summer to autumn there was a more simple and fragile phytoplankton community ecosystem in the studied lakes in the eutrophic lakes mlbl of the water dom also reduced along with phytoplankton community succession mlbl is used to estimate the overall lability of the dom with higher mlbl in summer indicating higher molecular lability of dom than in autumn this was consistent with the reduced fi and β α of cdom in the eutrophic lakes fig 8a and b indicating that both the biodegradability of cdom and the proportion of newly produced cdom decreased from summer to autumn the growth of phytoplankton and its biomass in autumn was lower than in summer in the lakes with a previous study concluding that the autochthonous dom which originated from the phytoplankton production and metabolic activity has greater bioavailability than humic dom therefore the phytoplankton derived dom is more likely to participate in the biogeochemical cycle of lake ecosystem liu et al 2019 which may be responsible for the higher molecular lability of dom in summer to clarify the molecular level changes of dom with the seasonal phytoplankton community succession we analyzed all molecular compounds which can be partly derived from the autochthonous sources including crams saturated fatty acids unsaturated aliphatics peptides and sugars cram percentage significantly increased during autumn which was commonly linked with refractory compounds being detected in diverse natural environments thereby suggesting that increasing cram may be responsible for the lower molecular lability of autumn dom other molecular formula percentages were all diminished in autumn fig 5 since they were already been proven to be biodegradable liu et al 2019 it is worth mentioning that in the studied mesotrophic and oligotrophic lakes although the fi and β α of water cdom decreased with the phytoplankton community succession from summer to autumn fig 8c and d the mlbl value of the whole dom pool did not show the same trend we speculated that since the phytoplankton derived dom occupied a lower percentage of the dom pool in both these lakes than in eutrophic lakes the phytoplankton community succession with the changing season weakly impacted the dom molecular characteristics the dom pool in the mesotrophic and oligotrophic lakes may be dominated and controlled by the allochthonous sources considering the phytoplankton in summer the dominant phytoplankton populations in all studied lakes were all chlorophyta when autumn came even though the dominant phytoplankton populations in the eutrophic lakes did not change but they changed to bacillariophyta in the poyang lake and cyanophyta in the other mesotrophic and oligotrophic lakes the succession of the dominant phytoplankton population may be responsible for the change of cdom composition which can also affect the phytoplankton biomass and community structure it is with regret that we only presented the discussion and data in summer and autumn in this study there has a large temperature difference between summer and winter and the influence of this environmental change on dom composition may be more remarkable in the further research the spring and winter would be considered this is very important to the whole season evaluation of dom biogeochemical cycle 5 conclusions the changes of dom components along with the trophic gradients and phytoplankton community succession in lakes are crucial for understanding the role of dom in aquatic biogeochemical cycles in the present study we used both eem parafac and ft icr ms to determine the molecular transformations of the water dom along with the trophic gradients and phytoplankton community succession in lakes our study provides evidence at the molecular level that eutrophication with the phytoplankton growth is vital in the generation of heteroatom s containing compounds we also found that the trophic state effectively influences the refractory dom components like crams and o3s o5s compounds with the results suggesting higher nutrient levels and greater accumulation of these refractory compounds the taxology of phytoplankton species directly influences the molecular composition of autochthonous dom phytoplankton community succession from summer to autumn could affect the molecular lability of dom with little effect on the highly bioavailable autochthonous dom

15524,since nearly half of the world s population lives near the coast coastal areas have become hotspots for microplastic mp pollution due to human activity the ubiquity of natural colloids in coastal waters plays a critical role in the potential fate of and risks posed by mps nevertheless far less has been known regarding the aggregation of mps with inorganic natural clay colloids especially in the complicated nearshore environment in this study the aggregation behavior of mps as well as the interaction between mps and clay particles were investigated under different nearshore environmental conditions mp to clay ratio salinity gradient humic acid concentration and wave energy the aggregation behavior was subjected by the repulsive energy barrier between particles and external energy transferred to the system the low energy associated with mild wave conditions was favorable for the occurrence of aggregation whereas sustained high energy under intense wave conditions was found to be detrimental to the aggregation behavior and the aggregates were prone to fragmentation even if particles coalesced into large clusters the analysis for the environmental fate of mps demonstrated that the shoreline was likely to be the sink for most mps ultimately graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics clay particles aggregation nearshore environment wave energy environmental fate data availability the data have been included in the manuscript 1 introduction the intensive use and disposal of plastic products have become a serious global environmental threat with small scaled plastics in particular demanding increased attention due to their high persistence adsorption capacity and bioavailability microplastics mps may be derived directly from the microbeads widely used in personal care products in which case they are referred to as primary microplastics or they may be released as a result of degradation and fragmentation of disposed plastic products e g ultraviolet irradiation mechanical abrasion or biodegradation in which case they are referred to as secondary microplastics wang et al 2021 2022 because of their tiny size mps pose a great danger to ecosystems and organisms owing to their innate hydrophobicity mps can adsorb organic contaminants and facilitate transport of these contaminants between different environmental compartments liu et al 2018 furthermore the large surface area of mps entails a greater adsorption capacity and higher toxicity risks xu et al 2022 these tiny plastics are vectors of organic contaminants and pose multiple burdens to organisms from small microbes to large mammals through ingestion rochman et al 2013a in some cases animals confuse mps for food and ingest them by mistake leading to false satiation slowed growth rates and impaired reproduction romera castillo et al 2018 ultimately the toxic effects triggered by mp bioaccumulation through the food chain can affect the health of all living organisms including humans the prevalence and accumulation of mps has sparked worldwide concern about their impact on ecosystems plastic particles discharged from wastewater treatment plants and released from human activity have a high likelihood of ending up in the marine ecosystem in fact between 4 8 and 12 7 million tons of plastics enter the ocean every year munoz et al 2021 the pathways of mps entering the marine environment include terrestrial sources river discharge maritime activity and atmospheric deposition with terrestrial sources accounting for more than 80 li et al 2018a since nearly half of the world s population lives near the coast coastal areas have become hotspots for mp pollution due to nearshore human activity zhang 2017 for instance previous research has shown a strong correlation between coastal plastic concentrations and local population density zhao et al 2015 most of the plastics that enter the ocean remain near the coastline even after several years according to recent field work and modeling studies lebreton et al 2012 the plastic polymers commonly found in the marine environment are polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polyethylene terephthalate pet and polyvinyl chloride pvc andrady 2011 rochman et al 2013b xu et al 2021 low density polymers easily float and transport while high density polymers are likely to sink to the seabed for instance as a function of the low density property of pe and pp they were found in a recent study to be more abundant along the great lakes shoreline compared to other high density polymers such as ps pet pvc zbyszewski et al 2014 another study also found pe and pp to be the predominant fibers and fragments in china s coastal fishery areas zhang et al 2021 as such we focused our research on mp pollution in coastal waters employing pe as the basis for modeling mps typical environmental behaviors of mps such as aggregation settlement and transport may determine their fate in the marine environment and the toxicity risk they pose to marine fauna most of the studies in this domain have focused on the aggregation between mps homoaggregation in the freshwater environment shams et al 2020 sun et al 2021 the effects of electrolytes ph and dissolved organic matter dom on aggregation kinetics and mechanisms have been investigated in previous studies li et al 2018b the stability and aggregation behavior of nanoscale particles such as titanium dioxide with clay colloids heteroaggregation at various electrolyte solutions and ph levels meanwhile has been addressed tang and cheng 2018 moreover hydrophobic interaction bridging between particles surface charge neutralization and electrostatic and steric effects may the major factors affecting the stability and aggregation of colloids cai et al 2018 dong et al 2019 nevertheless the interaction of mps with natural colloids which is expected to play a critical role in the potential fate of and risks posed by mps has not yet been adequately investigated especially in the complex context of coastal waters inorganic natural clay colloids which are the natural products of weathering and crushing of rocks and soil are widespread in coastal waters the ubiquity of clay particles all but guarantees that a certain degree of interaction with mps will be occurring in coastal waters and this may influence the aggregation and deposition of the mps present variations in salinity gradients and the presence of dom in coastal waters can also be expected to influence the aggregation behavior and environmental fate of mps moreover coastal waters are energetic areas subject to wind tides and waves all of which are significant factors in drifting longshore and cross shore transport sedimentation and resuspension zhang 2017 the aggregation behavior and environmental fate of mps under the control of these hydrodynamic forces remain unclear and need to be further explored in this context the objectives underlying our study were to 1 investigate the aggregation behavior of mps as well as the interaction between mps and clay particles under various mp to clay ratios salinity gradients and dom concentrations 2 uncover the aggregation mechanism based on an analysis rooted in derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory 3 describe the aggregation profiles of mps and clay particles in coastal waters under different wave conditions and 4 simulate the deposition and environmental fate of mp clay aggregates in coastal waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the pe used in our study was obtained from micro powders inc new york usa the hydrophilic bentonite and other chemicals used including sodium chloride nacl humic acid sodium salt and tween 20 were all purchased from sigma aldrich ontario canada all chemicals were of reagent grade or higher deionized water prepared using a milli q system was used in all the experiments 2 2 characteristics of coastal environments from the estuary to the ocean the salinity of seawater gradually increases from just a few practical salinity units psu to tens of psu bi et al 2021 chen et al 2021 dong et al 2019 in the present study nacl was added to deionized water to achieve the salinity ranging from 3 4 to 34 0 psu moreover the concentration of dom can decrease from 10 mg l upstream concentration in estuarine water to 1 mg l mean concentration in seawater thurman 2012 as such the humic acid sodium salt ha was applied at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mg l in our study to represent realistic levels of dom in coastal waters it is also worth noting that in coastal waters the suspended sediment concentration can vary from as little as a few g m3 to several thousand g m3 balasubramanian et al 2020 where clay particles are the principal constituent of suspended sediments accounting for about 20 of the sediment zhu et al 2022 as such bentonite concentrations ranging from 10 to 500 mg l were applied to simulate the influence of clay particles in coastal waters to facilitate detection and comparison the concentration of mps for all experiments was set as 10 mg l which was also consistent with the level used in previous studies lenz et al 2016 li et al 2019 disregarding other factors such as dilution transport and wall interference the rotational flow in flasks can simulate the levels of mixing energy in the wave required to study the aggregation of mps in nearshore waters lo and yu 2002 the mixing energy levels can be represented by wave energy dissipation rate in erlenmeyer flasks the energy dissipation rate in turn as a function of the liquid volume and rotation speed can be estimated by the following experimental equation fujita et al 1994 lo and yu 2002 1 ε 1 09 10 6 v 0 25 n 2 81 where ε is the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate kw m3 v is the liquid volume ml and n is the rotation speed rpm on the reflective beach the wave energy dissipation rate can be greater than 0 3 kw m3 due to its small water depth while it decreases to 0 05 kw m3 on the quasi equilibrium profile li et al 2021b moreover the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate has been reported to be as high as 1 kw m3 under plunging breaking waves li et al 2009 and elsewhere breaking waves in nearshore waters have been reported to be capable of generating energy dissipation rates in the range of 0 05 2 6 kw m3 sun et al 2010 zhao et al 2016 a higher dissipation rate it should be noted indicates more intense turbulence and higher energy in the wave to simulate both mild and intense wave conditions in our study rotation speeds of 90 and 255 rpm were applied representing turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates of approximately 0 1 and 2 0 kw m3 calculated using eq 1 where v 100 ml respectively due to its low density most pe in nearshore waters is in the surface layer where the turbulent intensity is higher li et al 2021b accordingly the upper range of mixing energy was chosen for the simulation 2 3 sample preparation and experimental design a stock suspension of mps was prepared by dispersing 20 mg of pe powder into 1 l of deionized water due to the hydrophobicity of pe a non ionic surfactant tween 20 was added to the stock suspension of mps at a concentration of 0 0001 v v 1 ppm to keep the mps stable and to prevent agglomeration in keeping with previous studies shams et al 2020 sun et al 2021 wang et al 2020 the stock suspension of mps was mixed at 13 000 rpm for 30 min using an ultra turrax t25 homogenizer ika germany to achieve uniform dispersion after diluting the stock suspension of mps to 10 mg l which is the concentration of mps in all samples the trace amount of surfactant in the samples is expected to be negligible meanwhile a stock suspension of clay was prepared by mixing 1 0 g of bentonite into 1 l of deionized water the stock suspension of clay was shaken and then homogenized in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min before each use to investigate the effect of mp to clay ratio on aggregation and fate of mps different concentrations of clay 10 100 and 500 mg l were added into the suspension of mps with 34 0 psu to achieve different mp to clay ratios 1 1 1 10 and 1 50 respectively various concentration gradients for salinity 3 4 6 8 13 6 20 4 27 2 and 34 0 psu and ha 1 2 4 6 8 and 10 mg l were applied at a clay concentration of 100 mg l in order to explore the behavior and mechanism of homoaggregation of mp to mp and the heteroaggregation of mp to clay the above mentioned samples were processed in a new brunswick innova 42r incubator shaker eppendorf usa for 1 h at 0 75 inch orbit 90 rpm and 20 c to simulate mild wave conditions to better simulate the environmental conditions of high salinity and low dom in nearshore waters a mixture with 34 0 psu 1 mg l ha and 100 mg l clay was employed for the experiments representing the batch wave condition the mixtures were shaken for durations of 0 5 1 3 6 9 and 12 h at 90 rpm and 255 rpm representing mild and intense wave conditions respectively to investigate the effect of wave condition on the homoaggregation and heteroaggregation each sample was prepared at a volume of 100 ml in an erlenmeyer flask once the pre set shaking time had elapsed the mixtures were kept stationary for 24 h in order to separate the negatively buoyant from the buoyant aggregates the samples were then analyzed by taking the surface and bottom suspensions to evaluate the floating and settling of aggregates 2 4 characterization of mps clay particles and aggregates a scanning electron microscope sem hitachi s 3400 n tokyo japan with 15 kv electron accelerating voltage and equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds jeol jms 5310 lv was used to observe the surface morphology and elemental distribution of the samples the pristine mps and clay particles were affixed to carbon tape on a holder for further sem eds characterization a 20 μl sample of each aqueous solution was taken and dropped onto the aluminum sample holder then dried in a fume hood for 24 h at room temperature i e 25 c for further sem eds characterization fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir measurement was performed to identify the functional groups of mps using the invenio s ftir spectrophotometer bruker optics ettlingen germany moreover the crystalline structure of the clay particles was investigated by means of x ray diffraction xrd analysis with cu kα radiation in 2θ mode the zeta potentials of the mps and clay particles at different salinities and ha concentrations meanwhile were obtained using malvern zetasizer nano zs analyzer malvern instruments worcestershire usa at room temperature the concentrations of mps and clay particles were consistent with those in the batch experiments i e 10 and 100 mg l respectively the particle size distribution of aggregates was measured using a laser in situ scattering and transmissometry analyzer lisst 200x sequoia scientific washington usa a 20 ml sample of each suspension was taken from different flasks and scanned to obtain 1 min data and the average of data was used to determine the particle size distribution of the aggregates background data was collected before each measurement using deionized water in the batch mp to clay ratio experiments the total organic carbon toc of suspension sample in the bottom was recorded using a total organic carbon analyzer toc l shimadzu kyoto japan to analyze the settlement of mps magnetic stirrers were installed to thoroughly agitate the suspension in the vials and uniformly distribute the sample since dissolved organic carbon doc may leach from mps during shaking a control sample was performed to identify the doc released by the mps romera castillo et al 2018 the control sample was prepared with the same procedure and measured after filtration by a 0 22 µm pvdf microfiltration membrane the toc in the sediment was identified excluding the doc released by the mps 2 5 derjaguin landau verwey overbeek theory derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory describes the forces between the surfaces of charged particles interacting through a liquid medium and can be applied to analyze particle to particle aggregation behavior derjaguin 1954 shams et al 2020 the surface interaction energies between charged particles are subject to van der waals attraction and electrostatic double layer repulsion as a function of the separation distance between two interacting particles gregory 2005 bearing in mind these considerations dlvo interaction energies of mp to mp and mp to clay were assumed as a sphere sphere geometry and detailed calculation processes are presented in the supplementary material 2 6 scenarios for analyzing the environmental fate of mp clay aggregates due to the low density of pe mps they remain at the surface of the sea for a considerable period of time and are transported with the current the long term stability and mobility of low density mps cause the marine environment to be endangered at an expanded scale mps may begin to overcome buoyancy through aggregation behavior and ultimately settle which is an important phenomenon that largely governs the transport fate and bioavailability of mps in the nearshore environment modeling is a common approach for exploring environmental issues hong et al 2021 sundar et al 2021 wei et al 2021 accordingly in our study the transport and fate of mps after aggregating with clay particles were simulated for further assessing the risk of mp pollution in the nearshore environment the density of heteroaggregates deemed to be a critical characteristic in determining the fate of mps was calculated by the procedure provided in the supplementary material the fate of high density aggregates above the density of seawater was determined based on the terminal sinking velocity of aggregates and horizontal velocity of current flow two scenarios were considered 0 1 and 1 m s of horizontal velocity of current flow with 1 m depth of water in investigating the terminal deposition of mps for turbulent flow the terminal sinking velocity v m s can be calculated using the following equation 2 v 1 74 g ρ a g g r e g a t e ρ s e a w a t e r d a g g r e g a t e ρ s e a w a t e r where ρ s e a w a t e r is the density of seawater i e 1030 kg m3 d a g g r e g a t e is the diameter of mp clay aggregates and g is the gravity constant 9 81 m s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 aggregation behaviors of mps and clay particles the size distribution and characterization of pristine mps with an average size of 7 0 μm and clay with an average size of 0 6 μm are shown in fig s1 the ftir spectrum shows the absorbance peaks of mps in which the peaks at 1471 ch2 scissoring vibration and 718 cm 1 ch2 rocking vibration are the characteristic bands used to identify pe feng et al 2022 the xrd pattern of clay shows reflection peaks at 6 51 19 67 27 98 and 35 05 fig s1d corresponding to the characteristics of the na montmorillonite structure bi et al 2022 the sem images and eds element analysis of mp homoaggregation are presented in fig 1 c and e because pe mp is a saturated hydrocarbon with a high molecular weight the c element corresponds to the mps as also evidenced by fig 1a the considerably high percentage of c element suggests that these clusters represent aggregates of mps since the samples on the holder were too thin some aluminum from the substrate was detected the percentage of c element in point 2 was comparably lower due to the presence of some nacl crystals covering mps at this site fig 1c as shown by the increased percentage of na and cl elements the interaction between mps and clay particles meanwhile is shown in fig 1d and f as can be seen in the figure in some instances mps were wrapped by floccules according to the results of the eds element analysis the accompanying presence of o mg al and si elements in the floccules confirmed the adsorption of clay particles on mps since these elements are the main constituents of clay as observation also supported by fig 1b heteroaggregation is more likely than homoaggregation to occur in the marine environment due to the abundance of natural colloids lowry et al 2012 therefore the aggregation and fate of mps at different mp to clay ratios 1 1 1 10 or 1 50 was investigated at 34 0 psu of salinity fig 2 shows the variation in particle size distribution at different mp to clay ratios at an mp to clay ratio of 1 1 the particle size was primarily distributed in the range of 10 14 µm in the surface layer and 6 12 µm in the bottom layer suggesting minor aggregation when the mp to clay ratio increased to 1 10 the particle size distribution increased with the particle size distribution of the surface layer peaking in the ranges of 12 16 µm and 37 72 µm in the bottom layer at this mp to clay ratio meanwhile most particles presented in a size range between 19 and 44 µm this considerable increase in particle size can be attributed to the enhanced interaction between mps and clay particles induced by the increased ratio of clay previous studies have also pointed out that clay particles can interact with different types of colloids in aqueous solutions to form heteroaggregates such as oil clay cyanobacteria clay and tio2 nanoparticle clay clusters ji et al 2021b liu et al 2021 tang and cheng 2018 finally at an mp to clay ratio of 1 50 the particle size of the aggregates decreased relative to the particle sizes observed at the 1 10 ratio peaks in particle size distribution were observed at 6 and 14 µm in the surface layer and at 3 and 19 µm in the bottom layer excessive concentration of clay increased significantly the chance of collisions between clay particles resulting in an increased likelihood of self aggregation and a decreased likelihood of heteroaggregation with mps since the original size of clay particles was less than that of mps the particle size of homoaggregation among clay particles was smaller than the particle size of heteroaggregation between clay particles and mps as indicated by the lower value of the particle size distribution comparing fig 2a and b it can be observed that the larger the size of the aggregates is the lower the volume concentration of aggregates in the surface layer will be the altered settlement behavior of the aggregates is attributable to the adsorption capacity of the clay to mps li et al 2021a at an mp to clay ratio of 1 10 the maximum particle size distribution corresponded with the lowest volume concentration of aggregates in the surface layer according to this result we can infer that the heteroaggregation between clay particles and mps caused more mps to overcome buoyancy and settle to the bottom layer and thus the volume concentration of aggregates in the surface layer was reduced this inference is supported by the results of the toc analysis fig 2c since pe is composed of carbon and hydrogen we used the toc concentration in the samples to analyze the concentration of mps moreover some carbon was also detected in clay particles as shown in the eds element analysis fig 1b so the toc in clay particles was also measured suspensions of clay particles without mps in concentrations of 10 100 and 500 mg l were prepared using the same procedure employed in the batch mp to clay ratio experiment after resting for 24 h the suspensions in the bottom were taken to measure the toc in the clay particles with the difference in toc between the samples and the clay particles representing the amount of mps settling to the bottom the toc concentration of mps increased initially followed by a reduction with the increasing ratio of clay particles the highest toc concentration of mps was identified at an mp to clay ratio of 1 10 which was exactly the ratio where the maximum of particle size distribution formed this result highlights the critical role clay particles play in the heteroaggregation and settling behavior of mps as mentioned above self aggregation of clay particles may inhibit the adsorption of clay particles on mps and this may explain the reduction of toc concentration of mps at an mp to clay ratio of 1 50 moreover although the density of pe mps is less than that of seawater 1 02 g cm3 these findings demonstrate that mps tend to co settle with clay particles rather than floating entirely on the surface in this regard high concentrations of mps in the sediment have been reported even when the density of the mps is lower than that of the seawater song et al 2017 van cauwenberghe et al 2015 mps present in seawater can overcome buoyancy through interaction with other colloids and reach the seafloor affecting the marine benthic environment 3 2 effect of salinity on the aggregation of mps and clay particles aggregation behavior is generally controlled by the ionic strength of the medium and the valence of the electrolyte seawater is a complex aqueous solution with the presence of multiple ions since the main component in seawater is sodium chloride our study was particularly interested in the effect of monovalent electrolytes on the aggregation behavior in seawater nacl solutions were used to simulate seawater with salinities ranging from 3 4 to 34 0 psu the effects of salinity on the aggregation behavior of mps and clay particles were investigated as presented in fig 3 as can be seen in fig 3a the particle size of the surface and bottom layers increased slightly with increasing salinity due to the formation of aggregates at 3 4 psu and 6 8 psu of salinity the particle size distribution in the surface layer had peaks at 6 µm and 14 µm respectively subsequently aggregation occurred more gradually with a peak only appearing at 14 µm at high concentrations of salinity larger values were observed in the distribution of aggregate size in the bottom layer in the mp to mp system moreover there was electrostatic repulsive force between the charged mp particles with the same valence state as the salinity of the mp suspension increased the increased electrolyte concentration resulted in the lowering of the electrostatic repulsive force this being attributable to charge neutralization and electrical double layer compression on the particle surface dong et al 2019 drechsler and grundke 2005 furthermore it was evident from the dlvo interaction energy profile fig 3c that it served to reduce the repulsive energy barrier between interacting mps leading to aggregation as shown in fig 3a the aggregation profiles at salinities ranging from 20 4 to 34 0 psu had similar particle size distributions this is due to the fact that the repulsive energy barriers were close at these salinity levels as supported by the results of the dlvo calculation shown in fig 3c the zeta potentials of the mps meanwhile became less negative and then switched to positive as the salinity increased table s2 whereas the electrostatic repulsion was weaker when the surface charge of the particle was near neutral tang and cheng 2018 the zeta potentials of the mps at 20 4 27 2 and 34 0 psu of salinity were 4 66 mv 4 44 mv and 4 64 mv table s2 respectively the similar absolute value of zeta potential resulted in almost equal electrostatic repulsive forces and accordingly almost equal repulsive energy barriers being generated at these salinity levels a lower repulsive energy barrier between interacting mps within the range of 8 3 13 5 kbt table s2 contributed to the formation of aggregates as shown in fig 3b the particle size distribution was significantly shifted to larger values with the peak value reaching 44 µm at 34 0 psu of salinity the formation of larger aggregates with increasing salinity was due to the neutralization of surface charges from the increasing electrolytes in the suspension and the reduction of electrostatic repulsive forces between mps and clay particles dong et al 2019 drechsler and grundke 2005 the presence of clay particles considerably promoted the aggregation due to the low repulsive energy barrier between the interacting mps and clay particles fig 3d meanwhile obvious increases in particle size distribution were observed at 27 2 and 34 0 psu of salinity the surface of mps was positively charged 4 44 and 4 64 mv respectively at 27 2 and 34 0 psu of salinity while the surface of clay particles was negatively charged 21 8 and 19 0 mv respectively at 27 2 and 34 0 psu of salinity table s2 therefore we can infer that no repulsive energy barrier existed between interacting mps and clay particles as demonstrated by the dlvo analysis results shown in fig 3d this resulted in the substantial aggregation of mps and clay particles which was consistent with the particle size distribution profiles comparing fig 3a and fig 3b the volume concentration of the surface layer was lower in the mp to clay system this being attributable to the co settling of mps with clay particles as a result of the adsorption of clay particles on mps the density of aggregates increased so more mps settled to the bottom 3 3 interactive effects of salinity and ha on aggregation fig 4 a and b show the particle size distribution of aggregates without and with clay particles as a function of ha concentrations under the influence of the low ha concentration a small degree of aggregation was observed from the particle size distribution in the surface layer in comparison with the pristine size distribution of mps fig s1a this was primarily due to the fact that the energy transferred to the system by shaking destabilizes the suspension in the suspension given that the particles were in close proximity they were subject to a repulsive energy barrier that prevented them from touching one another thus leading to stabilization in such cases if external energy is applied to the system the collision efficiency between particles will increase and some particles may overcome the repulsive energy barrier and coalesce langford et al 2022 nevertheless when the concentration of ha was 10 mg l aggregation behavior was inhibited since an extremely high repulsive energy barrier was established fig s2 because of the carboxylic acid and phenolic functional groups in ha it was negatively charged loosli et al 2013 it is also worth noting that the aromatic structure of ha can interact with mps through π π bonds alimi et al 2018 cai et al 2018 and in this case this resulted in more negative zeta potentials of mps table s2 ha can also be adsorbed on the surface of clay particles enhancing the negative zeta potential of clay particles table s2 li et al 2021a in this case the attachment of ha to the surface of mps and clay particles intensified the steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsive force between particles thus ultimately increasing the repulsive energy barrier when the concentration of ha in the mp to mp system was 1 mg l fig 4c larger particle sizes were observed in the surface layer with the increase of salinity suggesting the formation of a few aggregates however the particle size of the bottom layer maintained a consistent distribution regardless of salinity levels indicating that the aggregates were present only in the surface layer in the presence of 10 mg l ha fig 4e the aggregation in the surface layer seemed to disappear and almost no aggregation occurred in the system the particle size distribution in this system remained invariable with increasing salinity thus the stimulation of aggregation by salinity was insufficient to compensate for the inhibition of aggregation due to the high concentration of ha on the other hand when the concentration of ha in the mp to clay system was 1 mg l fig 4d the peak value of the bottom particle size distribution increased with increasing salinity while the particle size distribution in the surface layer remained stable indicating the presence of aggregates only in the bottom layer however the aggregation in the bottom layer eventually disappeared in the presence of 10 mg l ha fig 4f in the presence of high concentrations of ha it should be noted aggregation behavior was inhibited both with and without clay present in comparing fig 4c with fig 4d it can be observed that adding clay particles into mp suspensions promoted aggregation as supported by the dlvo analysis with the repulsive energy barriers between mps and clay particles being lower than those between interacting mps as illustrated in fig s2c and s2d furthermore the zeta potentials of the mps and clay particles became less negative with the increase of salinity resulting in weaker electrostatic repulsive force lower repulsive energy barrier and easier aggregation on the contrary the zeta potentials of mps and clay particles became more negative with the increase of ha concentration resulting in stronger electrostatic repulsive force higher repulsive energy barrier and more resistant aggregation as previously noted the effects of salinity and ha on aggregation behavior were found to be diametrically opposed mps were more likely to aggregate under high salinity and low ha conditions meanwhile the presence of clay was also found to contribute to the occurrence of aggregation 3 4 effect of wave conditions on the aggregation of mps and clay particles as noted in previous studies the energy contained in waves may have an impact on the aggregation behavior of the particles ji et al 2021a yang et al 2021 as such the homoaggregation of mps with mps and the heteroaggregation of mps with clay particles were investigated under mild and intense wave conditions for the mp to mp system under both wave conditions i e mild and intense fig 5 the higher volume concentration of particles appeared in the surface layer this due to the fact that pe particles are of a lower density than seawater thus most of the aggregates of mps floated in the surface layer and extremely few aggregates overcame the buoyancy force and were present in the bottom aqueous solution which was related to the size and shape of particles chubarenko et al 2016 as shown in fig 5a and b the particle size of aggregates became progressively larger as the mixing duration was extended from 0 5 to 12 h under mild wave conditions after 0 5 h of continuous mixing the particle size distribution in the mp to mp system ranged from 6 0 to 16 3 µm i e close to the size distribution of pristine mps on the other hand after a mixing duration of 12 h the particle size of the aggregates increased considerably up to 165 3 µm furthermore we noticed that the formation of large aggregates was accompanied by the appearance of trace amounts of fine particles in the bottom layer at a mixing duration of 12 h this may have been the result of a small percentage of particles being shattered into finer particles after the long period of subjection to mixing energy under intense wave conditions meanwhile fig 5c and d the particles initially coalesced into larger aggregates as the mixing duration increased but a subsequent decrease in particle size was observed while aggregation increased with a mixing duration of 3 9 h when the mixing duration was further extended to 12 h a reduction in particle size was observed attributable to the eventual fragmentation of the aggregates after a lengthy period of subjection to intense mixing energy the intense mixing energy caused the particles to disperse collide and then aggregate rapidly but the aggregates broke up shortly afterwards as time passed as displayed in fig 5d the particle size reduced to as low as 2 6 µm at a mixing duration of 12 h based on this result we can infer mps that have been present for a considerable period of time in nearshore waters with higher wave energy levels may have difficulty in coalescing the higher energy of collision due to the higher levels of mixing energy may cause the particles to shatter into particles smaller in size than the original ones in comparison to intense wave conditions fig 5c and d the overall volume concentration of particles and the volume concentrations of large size aggregates were greater under mild wave conditions fig 5a and b this observation suggests that mps aggregation behavior may be more prone to occur in nearshore waters with lower wave energy levels in our study under the simulated intense wave condition aggregation became less frequent and the majority of aggregates floated in the surface layers a phenomenon which would be more conducive to mps transporting over longer distances and affecting a wider area of the sea comparing fig 5a and c with fig 5b and d meanwhile the particle size distribution of aggregates in the bottom layer was broader over longer mixing durations this result suggests that the mps deposited on the seabed in the marine environment would be of a larger scale of size and this may result in more species of marine benthic organisms being endangered jâms et al 2020 fig 5e h shows the particle size distribution in both wave conditions for the mp to clay system as can be seen the volume concentration of particles peaked at 1 5 µl l in the surface layer while the volume concentration of particles reached 25 µl l in the bottom layer 17 times higher than the surface concentration this is attributable to the high density of clay particles causing them to settle gradually on the bottom after resting therefore the predominant aggregation in the surface layer could be considered as homoaggregation of mps whereas both homogeneous and heterogeneous aggregates of mps and clay particles were present in the bottom layer under mild wave conditions fig 5e and f a significant shift in particle size distribution toward larger values was observed in both the surface and bottom layers as the mixing duration increased this phenomenon indicates that the aggregates were distributed in both layers as shown in fig 5f particle sizes were concentrated in the range of 22 7 44 0 µm with extremely high concentrations at mixing durations of 6 12 h this range represented the dominant size of aggregates being deposited to the bottom under mild wave conditions moreover the aggregation profile of the mp to clay system under mild wave conditions was essentially the same as that of the mp to mp system suggesting that a similar aggregation scenario would be observed in low energy nearshore waters with or without the presence of clay particles the particle size variation in the mp to clay system under intense wave conditions is presented in fig 5g and h in the surface layer fig 6 g the particles coalesced into large size aggregates for mixing durations of 3 9 h and but then fragmented when the mixing duration was extended to 12 h i e the same phenomenon seen in fig 5c the aggregation profile in the surface layer was consistent with that observed in the case of the mp to mp system whereas the aggregation profile in the bottom layer clearly differed from that of the mp to mp system in the bottom layer of the mp to clay system fig 6h the particle size remained approximately within the range of 4 3 11 7 µm at various mixing durations and very few large size particles appeared this particle size range was close to the particle size of the pristine mps so we can infer that almost no homoaggregation of mps occurred in the bottom layer of the mp to clay system under the influence of intense mixing energy it can be concluded accordingly that nearshore waters with high wave energy levels are not favorable for aggregation of mps and clay particles therefore in high energy nearshore waters where a certain concentration of clay is present the effects of mp to clay heteroaggregation on benthic organisms can be expected to be concentrated mainly on small organisms moreover the observation of particle size distribution and volume concentration data in the mp to clay system revealed that intense wave conditions are still adverse to the aggregation behavior even in the presence of clay as was the case with the mp to mp system as discussed above 3 5 environmental implications for mp fate in the coastal zone fig s3 shows the calculated mass density of mp clay aggregates as a function of the number of clay particles adsorbed onto mps as can be seen when the number of clay particles adsorbed onto mps was less than 507 the density of the mp clay aggregates was lower than that of seawater i e 1030 kg m3 resulting in the aggregates floating whereas with an increase in clay particles adsorbing onto the mps the density of the mp clay aggregates exceeded that of seawater resulting in settling as these results suggest for low density mps only when combined with enough high density particles are they capable of overcoming buoyancy and sinking to the sea bottom the density of the mp clay aggregates was 1100 61 kg m3 when the point of saturation adsorption was reached the three dimensional surface plots presented in fig 6a and b illustrate the interactive effects of density and diameter on the terminal sinking velocity and mass the clay particles adsorbed on mps could attract other mps and then form an adsorption layer of clay particles ultimately forming clusters of various sizes to simplify the simulation it was assumed that clusters of different sizes were formed by mp clay aggregates of the same density as such the range of ρ a g g r e g a t e was from 1030 34 to 1100 61 kg m3 according to fig s3 the minimum value of d a g g r e g a t e meanwhile was considered to be the size of the individual mp clay aggregate 8 2 µm while the maximum value of d a g g r e g a t e was considered to be the size of the largest aggregate occurring in the bottom layer of the mp to clay system i e 100 µm as noted in section 3 4 above as shown in fig 6a the terminal sinking velocity was found to be sensitive to both factors with the density of mp clay aggregates having the greater effect on the terminal sinking velocity the velocity reached its maximum value as the density and diameter increased as shown in fig 6b the mass of mp clay aggregates was extremely sensitive to the diameter factor while only a slight effect was observed as a result of increasing density accordingly we can infer that the mass of aggregates ultimately settling on the seafloor will be governed largely by their size the terminal deposition of mp clay aggregates is shown in fig 6c and d as shown in the fig 6c when the horizontal velocity of the current flow was slow i e 0 1 m s high density aggregates were deposited at a distance of 5 25 m and low density aggregates were deposited significantly further away at a distance of 100 400 m on the other hand when the horizontal velocity of the current flow was fast i e 1 m s high density aggregates were deposited at a distance of 50 250 m and low density aggregates could migrate and settle down as distant as 3 5 km away traveling with the current fig 6d in other words the higher the horizontal velocity of current flow was the further away the mp clay aggregates were deposited moreover both a decrease in diameter and a decrease in density were found to be factors in the terminal deposition being further away compared with fig s4 the effect of density on settling distance was more pronounced as can be seen when the density of the aggregates was close to that of seawater the settlement was very slow while a slight increase in density resulted in a rapid reduction in settling distance according to the terminal deposition plots the circle symbols in plots representing mp clay aggregates became denser with a decrease in distance this indicates that most of the aggregates were prone to deposit in areas close to the shoreline and that in areas closer to the shoreline more aggregates settled on the seafloor an result consistent with previous studies zhang 2017 4 conclusions interactions between mps and clay particles are likely to occur in coastal waters since clay particles are prevalent there in this study we explored the aggregation behavior of mps with and without clay particles in the nearshore environment observing both the aggregation of mps and the adsorption of clay particles on mps the mp to clay system was found to have a lower volume concentration of particles in the surface layer compared to mp to mp system as our findings suggest the presence of clay particles may help mps to overcome buoyancy and carry mps to settle down moreover increased mp to clay ratios may enhance the interaction between mps and clay particles resulting in the formation of large aggregates on the other hand excessive concentrations of clay were found to inhibit the aggregation of mps with clay particles this being attributable to the increased chance of collision between clay particles and correspondingly an increased likelihood of self aggregation meanwhile we investigated the aggregation mechanism corresponding to the surface potential and energy barrier of particles the aggregation behaviors of mps in particular heteroaggregation between mps and clay particles were found to clearly increase with increasing salinity this effect was governed by the reduction in electrostatic repulsive force in turn due to charge neutralization and electrical double layer compression ha concentration in contrast was found to have the opposite effect the attachment of ha on the surface of particles intensified the repulsive energy barrier and hindered the aggregation of the particles nevertheless the external energy enabled the particles to overcome the repulsive energy barrier and coalesce moreover the low energy associated with mild wave conditions was favorable for the aggregation of mps and clay particles in contrast sustained high energy under intense wave conditions was found to be detrimental to the occurrence of aggregation behavior and the aggregates were prone to fragmentation even if particles coalesced into large clusters mp clay aggregates with lower density than seawater tended to spread with the current over longer distances and to affect a wider area of the sea only in combination with a sufficient concentration of high density particles could the mps overcome buoyancy and settle aggregates with smaller diameters and densities tended to be more likely to settle farther with density being the more critical factor of the two in determining the terminal deposition a high horizontal velocity of current flow was also found to cause mps to drift and to be deposited to the seafloor further afield aggregates tended to be more intensive with a greater mass in areas close to the shoreline which was likely to be the sink for most mps ultimately the fate of mps under other coastal conditions can be further

15524,since nearly half of the world s population lives near the coast coastal areas have become hotspots for microplastic mp pollution due to human activity the ubiquity of natural colloids in coastal waters plays a critical role in the potential fate of and risks posed by mps nevertheless far less has been known regarding the aggregation of mps with inorganic natural clay colloids especially in the complicated nearshore environment in this study the aggregation behavior of mps as well as the interaction between mps and clay particles were investigated under different nearshore environmental conditions mp to clay ratio salinity gradient humic acid concentration and wave energy the aggregation behavior was subjected by the repulsive energy barrier between particles and external energy transferred to the system the low energy associated with mild wave conditions was favorable for the occurrence of aggregation whereas sustained high energy under intense wave conditions was found to be detrimental to the aggregation behavior and the aggregates were prone to fragmentation even if particles coalesced into large clusters the analysis for the environmental fate of mps demonstrated that the shoreline was likely to be the sink for most mps ultimately graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics clay particles aggregation nearshore environment wave energy environmental fate data availability the data have been included in the manuscript 1 introduction the intensive use and disposal of plastic products have become a serious global environmental threat with small scaled plastics in particular demanding increased attention due to their high persistence adsorption capacity and bioavailability microplastics mps may be derived directly from the microbeads widely used in personal care products in which case they are referred to as primary microplastics or they may be released as a result of degradation and fragmentation of disposed plastic products e g ultraviolet irradiation mechanical abrasion or biodegradation in which case they are referred to as secondary microplastics wang et al 2021 2022 because of their tiny size mps pose a great danger to ecosystems and organisms owing to their innate hydrophobicity mps can adsorb organic contaminants and facilitate transport of these contaminants between different environmental compartments liu et al 2018 furthermore the large surface area of mps entails a greater adsorption capacity and higher toxicity risks xu et al 2022 these tiny plastics are vectors of organic contaminants and pose multiple burdens to organisms from small microbes to large mammals through ingestion rochman et al 2013a in some cases animals confuse mps for food and ingest them by mistake leading to false satiation slowed growth rates and impaired reproduction romera castillo et al 2018 ultimately the toxic effects triggered by mp bioaccumulation through the food chain can affect the health of all living organisms including humans the prevalence and accumulation of mps has sparked worldwide concern about their impact on ecosystems plastic particles discharged from wastewater treatment plants and released from human activity have a high likelihood of ending up in the marine ecosystem in fact between 4 8 and 12 7 million tons of plastics enter the ocean every year munoz et al 2021 the pathways of mps entering the marine environment include terrestrial sources river discharge maritime activity and atmospheric deposition with terrestrial sources accounting for more than 80 li et al 2018a since nearly half of the world s population lives near the coast coastal areas have become hotspots for mp pollution due to nearshore human activity zhang 2017 for instance previous research has shown a strong correlation between coastal plastic concentrations and local population density zhao et al 2015 most of the plastics that enter the ocean remain near the coastline even after several years according to recent field work and modeling studies lebreton et al 2012 the plastic polymers commonly found in the marine environment are polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polyethylene terephthalate pet and polyvinyl chloride pvc andrady 2011 rochman et al 2013b xu et al 2021 low density polymers easily float and transport while high density polymers are likely to sink to the seabed for instance as a function of the low density property of pe and pp they were found in a recent study to be more abundant along the great lakes shoreline compared to other high density polymers such as ps pet pvc zbyszewski et al 2014 another study also found pe and pp to be the predominant fibers and fragments in china s coastal fishery areas zhang et al 2021 as such we focused our research on mp pollution in coastal waters employing pe as the basis for modeling mps typical environmental behaviors of mps such as aggregation settlement and transport may determine their fate in the marine environment and the toxicity risk they pose to marine fauna most of the studies in this domain have focused on the aggregation between mps homoaggregation in the freshwater environment shams et al 2020 sun et al 2021 the effects of electrolytes ph and dissolved organic matter dom on aggregation kinetics and mechanisms have been investigated in previous studies li et al 2018b the stability and aggregation behavior of nanoscale particles such as titanium dioxide with clay colloids heteroaggregation at various electrolyte solutions and ph levels meanwhile has been addressed tang and cheng 2018 moreover hydrophobic interaction bridging between particles surface charge neutralization and electrostatic and steric effects may the major factors affecting the stability and aggregation of colloids cai et al 2018 dong et al 2019 nevertheless the interaction of mps with natural colloids which is expected to play a critical role in the potential fate of and risks posed by mps has not yet been adequately investigated especially in the complex context of coastal waters inorganic natural clay colloids which are the natural products of weathering and crushing of rocks and soil are widespread in coastal waters the ubiquity of clay particles all but guarantees that a certain degree of interaction with mps will be occurring in coastal waters and this may influence the aggregation and deposition of the mps present variations in salinity gradients and the presence of dom in coastal waters can also be expected to influence the aggregation behavior and environmental fate of mps moreover coastal waters are energetic areas subject to wind tides and waves all of which are significant factors in drifting longshore and cross shore transport sedimentation and resuspension zhang 2017 the aggregation behavior and environmental fate of mps under the control of these hydrodynamic forces remain unclear and need to be further explored in this context the objectives underlying our study were to 1 investigate the aggregation behavior of mps as well as the interaction between mps and clay particles under various mp to clay ratios salinity gradients and dom concentrations 2 uncover the aggregation mechanism based on an analysis rooted in derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory 3 describe the aggregation profiles of mps and clay particles in coastal waters under different wave conditions and 4 simulate the deposition and environmental fate of mp clay aggregates in coastal waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the pe used in our study was obtained from micro powders inc new york usa the hydrophilic bentonite and other chemicals used including sodium chloride nacl humic acid sodium salt and tween 20 were all purchased from sigma aldrich ontario canada all chemicals were of reagent grade or higher deionized water prepared using a milli q system was used in all the experiments 2 2 characteristics of coastal environments from the estuary to the ocean the salinity of seawater gradually increases from just a few practical salinity units psu to tens of psu bi et al 2021 chen et al 2021 dong et al 2019 in the present study nacl was added to deionized water to achieve the salinity ranging from 3 4 to 34 0 psu moreover the concentration of dom can decrease from 10 mg l upstream concentration in estuarine water to 1 mg l mean concentration in seawater thurman 2012 as such the humic acid sodium salt ha was applied at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mg l in our study to represent realistic levels of dom in coastal waters it is also worth noting that in coastal waters the suspended sediment concentration can vary from as little as a few g m3 to several thousand g m3 balasubramanian et al 2020 where clay particles are the principal constituent of suspended sediments accounting for about 20 of the sediment zhu et al 2022 as such bentonite concentrations ranging from 10 to 500 mg l were applied to simulate the influence of clay particles in coastal waters to facilitate detection and comparison the concentration of mps for all experiments was set as 10 mg l which was also consistent with the level used in previous studies lenz et al 2016 li et al 2019 disregarding other factors such as dilution transport and wall interference the rotational flow in flasks can simulate the levels of mixing energy in the wave required to study the aggregation of mps in nearshore waters lo and yu 2002 the mixing energy levels can be represented by wave energy dissipation rate in erlenmeyer flasks the energy dissipation rate in turn as a function of the liquid volume and rotation speed can be estimated by the following experimental equation fujita et al 1994 lo and yu 2002 1 ε 1 09 10 6 v 0 25 n 2 81 where ε is the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate kw m3 v is the liquid volume ml and n is the rotation speed rpm on the reflective beach the wave energy dissipation rate can be greater than 0 3 kw m3 due to its small water depth while it decreases to 0 05 kw m3 on the quasi equilibrium profile li et al 2021b moreover the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate has been reported to be as high as 1 kw m3 under plunging breaking waves li et al 2009 and elsewhere breaking waves in nearshore waters have been reported to be capable of generating energy dissipation rates in the range of 0 05 2 6 kw m3 sun et al 2010 zhao et al 2016 a higher dissipation rate it should be noted indicates more intense turbulence and higher energy in the wave to simulate both mild and intense wave conditions in our study rotation speeds of 90 and 255 rpm were applied representing turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates of approximately 0 1 and 2 0 kw m3 calculated using eq 1 where v 100 ml respectively due to its low density most pe in nearshore waters is in the surface layer where the turbulent intensity is higher li et al 2021b accordingly the upper range of mixing energy was chosen for the simulation 2 3 sample preparation and experimental design a stock suspension of mps was prepared by dispersing 20 mg of pe powder into 1 l of deionized water due to the hydrophobicity of pe a non ionic surfactant tween 20 was added to the stock suspension of mps at a concentration of 0 0001 v v 1 ppm to keep the mps stable and to prevent agglomeration in keeping with previous studies shams et al 2020 sun et al 2021 wang et al 2020 the stock suspension of mps was mixed at 13 000 rpm for 30 min using an ultra turrax t25 homogenizer ika germany to achieve uniform dispersion after diluting the stock suspension of mps to 10 mg l which is the concentration of mps in all samples the trace amount of surfactant in the samples is expected to be negligible meanwhile a stock suspension of clay was prepared by mixing 1 0 g of bentonite into 1 l of deionized water the stock suspension of clay was shaken and then homogenized in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min before each use to investigate the effect of mp to clay ratio on aggregation and fate of mps different concentrations of clay 10 100 and 500 mg l were added into the suspension of mps with 34 0 psu to achieve different mp to clay ratios 1 1 1 10 and 1 50 respectively various concentration gradients for salinity 3 4 6 8 13 6 20 4 27 2 and 34 0 psu and ha 1 2 4 6 8 and 10 mg l were applied at a clay concentration of 100 mg l in order to explore the behavior and mechanism of homoaggregation of mp to mp and the heteroaggregation of mp to clay the above mentioned samples were processed in a new brunswick innova 42r incubator shaker eppendorf usa for 1 h at 0 75 inch orbit 90 rpm and 20 c to simulate mild wave conditions to better simulate the environmental conditions of high salinity and low dom in nearshore waters a mixture with 34 0 psu 1 mg l ha and 100 mg l clay was employed for the experiments representing the batch wave condition the mixtures were shaken for durations of 0 5 1 3 6 9 and 12 h at 90 rpm and 255 rpm representing mild and intense wave conditions respectively to investigate the effect of wave condition on the homoaggregation and heteroaggregation each sample was prepared at a volume of 100 ml in an erlenmeyer flask once the pre set shaking time had elapsed the mixtures were kept stationary for 24 h in order to separate the negatively buoyant from the buoyant aggregates the samples were then analyzed by taking the surface and bottom suspensions to evaluate the floating and settling of aggregates 2 4 characterization of mps clay particles and aggregates a scanning electron microscope sem hitachi s 3400 n tokyo japan with 15 kv electron accelerating voltage and equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds jeol jms 5310 lv was used to observe the surface morphology and elemental distribution of the samples the pristine mps and clay particles were affixed to carbon tape on a holder for further sem eds characterization a 20 μl sample of each aqueous solution was taken and dropped onto the aluminum sample holder then dried in a fume hood for 24 h at room temperature i e 25 c for further sem eds characterization fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir measurement was performed to identify the functional groups of mps using the invenio s ftir spectrophotometer bruker optics ettlingen germany moreover the crystalline structure of the clay particles was investigated by means of x ray diffraction xrd analysis with cu kα radiation in 2θ mode the zeta potentials of the mps and clay particles at different salinities and ha concentrations meanwhile were obtained using malvern zetasizer nano zs analyzer malvern instruments worcestershire usa at room temperature the concentrations of mps and clay particles were consistent with those in the batch experiments i e 10 and 100 mg l respectively the particle size distribution of aggregates was measured using a laser in situ scattering and transmissometry analyzer lisst 200x sequoia scientific washington usa a 20 ml sample of each suspension was taken from different flasks and scanned to obtain 1 min data and the average of data was used to determine the particle size distribution of the aggregates background data was collected before each measurement using deionized water in the batch mp to clay ratio experiments the total organic carbon toc of suspension sample in the bottom was recorded using a total organic carbon analyzer toc l shimadzu kyoto japan to analyze the settlement of mps magnetic stirrers were installed to thoroughly agitate the suspension in the vials and uniformly distribute the sample since dissolved organic carbon doc may leach from mps during shaking a control sample was performed to identify the doc released by the mps romera castillo et al 2018 the control sample was prepared with the same procedure and measured after filtration by a 0 22 µm pvdf microfiltration membrane the toc in the sediment was identified excluding the doc released by the mps 2 5 derjaguin landau verwey overbeek theory derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory describes the forces between the surfaces of charged particles interacting through a liquid medium and can be applied to analyze particle to particle aggregation behavior derjaguin 1954 shams et al 2020 the surface interaction energies between charged particles are subject to van der waals attraction and electrostatic double layer repulsion as a function of the separation distance between two interacting particles gregory 2005 bearing in mind these considerations dlvo interaction energies of mp to mp and mp to clay were assumed as a sphere sphere geometry and detailed calculation processes are presented in the supplementary material 2 6 scenarios for analyzing the environmental fate of mp clay aggregates due to the low density of pe mps they remain at the surface of the sea for a considerable period of time and are transported with the current the long term stability and mobility of low density mps cause the marine environment to be endangered at an expanded scale mps may begin to overcome buoyancy through aggregation behavior and ultimately settle which is an important phenomenon that largely governs the transport fate and bioavailability of mps in the nearshore environment modeling is a common approach for exploring environmental issues hong et al 2021 sundar et al 2021 wei et al 2021 accordingly in our study the transport and fate of mps after aggregating with clay particles were simulated for further assessing the risk of mp pollution in the nearshore environment the density of heteroaggregates deemed to be a critical characteristic in determining the fate of mps was calculated by the procedure provided in the supplementary material the fate of high density aggregates above the density of seawater was determined based on the terminal sinking velocity of aggregates and horizontal velocity of current flow two scenarios were considered 0 1 and 1 m s of horizontal velocity of current flow with 1 m depth of water in investigating the terminal deposition of mps for turbulent flow the terminal sinking velocity v m s can be calculated using the following equation 2 v 1 74 g ρ a g g r e g a t e ρ s e a w a t e r d a g g r e g a t e ρ s e a w a t e r where ρ s e a w a t e r is the density of seawater i e 1030 kg m3 d a g g r e g a t e is the diameter of mp clay aggregates and g is the gravity constant 9 81 m s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 aggregation behaviors of mps and clay particles the size distribution and characterization of pristine mps with an average size of 7 0 μm and clay with an average size of 0 6 μm are shown in fig s1 the ftir spectrum shows the absorbance peaks of mps in which the peaks at 1471 ch2 scissoring vibration and 718 cm 1 ch2 rocking vibration are the characteristic bands used to identify pe feng et al 2022 the xrd pattern of clay shows reflection peaks at 6 51 19 67 27 98 and 35 05 fig s1d corresponding to the characteristics of the na montmorillonite structure bi et al 2022 the sem images and eds element analysis of mp homoaggregation are presented in fig 1 c and e because pe mp is a saturated hydrocarbon with a high molecular weight the c element corresponds to the mps as also evidenced by fig 1a the considerably high percentage of c element suggests that these clusters represent aggregates of mps since the samples on the holder were too thin some aluminum from the substrate was detected the percentage of c element in point 2 was comparably lower due to the presence of some nacl crystals covering mps at this site fig 1c as shown by the increased percentage of na and cl elements the interaction between mps and clay particles meanwhile is shown in fig 1d and f as can be seen in the figure in some instances mps were wrapped by floccules according to the results of the eds element analysis the accompanying presence of o mg al and si elements in the floccules confirmed the adsorption of clay particles on mps since these elements are the main constituents of clay as observation also supported by fig 1b heteroaggregation is more likely than homoaggregation to occur in the marine environment due to the abundance of natural colloids lowry et al 2012 therefore the aggregation and fate of mps at different mp to clay ratios 1 1 1 10 or 1 50 was investigated at 34 0 psu of salinity fig 2 shows the variation in particle size distribution at different mp to clay ratios at an mp to clay ratio of 1 1 the particle size was primarily distributed in the range of 10 14 µm in the surface layer and 6 12 µm in the bottom layer suggesting minor aggregation when the mp to clay ratio increased to 1 10 the particle size distribution increased with the particle size distribution of the surface layer peaking in the ranges of 12 16 µm and 37 72 µm in the bottom layer at this mp to clay ratio meanwhile most particles presented in a size range between 19 and 44 µm this considerable increase in particle size can be attributed to the enhanced interaction between mps and clay particles induced by the increased ratio of clay previous studies have also pointed out that clay particles can interact with different types of colloids in aqueous solutions to form heteroaggregates such as oil clay cyanobacteria clay and tio2 nanoparticle clay clusters ji et al 2021b liu et al 2021 tang and cheng 2018 finally at an mp to clay ratio of 1 50 the particle size of the aggregates decreased relative to the particle sizes observed at the 1 10 ratio peaks in particle size distribution were observed at 6 and 14 µm in the surface layer and at 3 and 19 µm in the bottom layer excessive concentration of clay increased significantly the chance of collisions between clay particles resulting in an increased likelihood of self aggregation and a decreased likelihood of heteroaggregation with mps since the original size of clay particles was less than that of mps the particle size of homoaggregation among clay particles was smaller than the particle size of heteroaggregation between clay particles and mps as indicated by the lower value of the particle size distribution comparing fig 2a and b it can be observed that the larger the size of the aggregates is the lower the volume concentration of aggregates in the surface layer will be the altered settlement behavior of the aggregates is attributable to the adsorption capacity of the clay to mps li et al 2021a at an mp to clay ratio of 1 10 the maximum particle size distribution corresponded with the lowest volume concentration of aggregates in the surface layer according to this result we can infer that the heteroaggregation between clay particles and mps caused more mps to overcome buoyancy and settle to the bottom layer and thus the volume concentration of aggregates in the surface layer was reduced this inference is supported by the results of the toc analysis fig 2c since pe is composed of carbon and hydrogen we used the toc concentration in the samples to analyze the concentration of mps moreover some carbon was also detected in clay particles as shown in the eds element analysis fig 1b so the toc in clay particles was also measured suspensions of clay particles without mps in concentrations of 10 100 and 500 mg l were prepared using the same procedure employed in the batch mp to clay ratio experiment after resting for 24 h the suspensions in the bottom were taken to measure the toc in the clay particles with the difference in toc between the samples and the clay particles representing the amount of mps settling to the bottom the toc concentration of mps increased initially followed by a reduction with the increasing ratio of clay particles the highest toc concentration of mps was identified at an mp to clay ratio of 1 10 which was exactly the ratio where the maximum of particle size distribution formed this result highlights the critical role clay particles play in the heteroaggregation and settling behavior of mps as mentioned above self aggregation of clay particles may inhibit the adsorption of clay particles on mps and this may explain the reduction of toc concentration of mps at an mp to clay ratio of 1 50 moreover although the density of pe mps is less than that of seawater 1 02 g cm3 these findings demonstrate that mps tend to co settle with clay particles rather than floating entirely on the surface in this regard high concentrations of mps in the sediment have been reported even when the density of the mps is lower than that of the seawater song et al 2017 van cauwenberghe et al 2015 mps present in seawater can overcome buoyancy through interaction with other colloids and reach the seafloor affecting the marine benthic environment 3 2 effect of salinity on the aggregation of mps and clay particles aggregation behavior is generally controlled by the ionic strength of the medium and the valence of the electrolyte seawater is a complex aqueous solution with the presence of multiple ions since the main component in seawater is sodium chloride our study was particularly interested in the effect of monovalent electrolytes on the aggregation behavior in seawater nacl solutions were used to simulate seawater with salinities ranging from 3 4 to 34 0 psu the effects of salinity on the aggregation behavior of mps and clay particles were investigated as presented in fig 3 as can be seen in fig 3a the particle size of the surface and bottom layers increased slightly with increasing salinity due to the formation of aggregates at 3 4 psu and 6 8 psu of salinity the particle size distribution in the surface layer had peaks at 6 µm and 14 µm respectively subsequently aggregation occurred more gradually with a peak only appearing at 14 µm at high concentrations of salinity larger values were observed in the distribution of aggregate size in the bottom layer in the mp to mp system moreover there was electrostatic repulsive force between the charged mp particles with the same valence state as the salinity of the mp suspension increased the increased electrolyte concentration resulted in the lowering of the electrostatic repulsive force this being attributable to charge neutralization and electrical double layer compression on the particle surface dong et al 2019 drechsler and grundke 2005 furthermore it was evident from the dlvo interaction energy profile fig 3c that it served to reduce the repulsive energy barrier between interacting mps leading to aggregation as shown in fig 3a the aggregation profiles at salinities ranging from 20 4 to 34 0 psu had similar particle size distributions this is due to the fact that the repulsive energy barriers were close at these salinity levels as supported by the results of the dlvo calculation shown in fig 3c the zeta potentials of the mps meanwhile became less negative and then switched to positive as the salinity increased table s2 whereas the electrostatic repulsion was weaker when the surface charge of the particle was near neutral tang and cheng 2018 the zeta potentials of the mps at 20 4 27 2 and 34 0 psu of salinity were 4 66 mv 4 44 mv and 4 64 mv table s2 respectively the similar absolute value of zeta potential resulted in almost equal electrostatic repulsive forces and accordingly almost equal repulsive energy barriers being generated at these salinity levels a lower repulsive energy barrier between interacting mps within the range of 8 3 13 5 kbt table s2 contributed to the formation of aggregates as shown in fig 3b the particle size distribution was significantly shifted to larger values with the peak value reaching 44 µm at 34 0 psu of salinity the formation of larger aggregates with increasing salinity was due to the neutralization of surface charges from the increasing electrolytes in the suspension and the reduction of electrostatic repulsive forces between mps and clay particles dong et al 2019 drechsler and grundke 2005 the presence of clay particles considerably promoted the aggregation due to the low repulsive energy barrier between the interacting mps and clay particles fig 3d meanwhile obvious increases in particle size distribution were observed at 27 2 and 34 0 psu of salinity the surface of mps was positively charged 4 44 and 4 64 mv respectively at 27 2 and 34 0 psu of salinity while the surface of clay particles was negatively charged 21 8 and 19 0 mv respectively at 27 2 and 34 0 psu of salinity table s2 therefore we can infer that no repulsive energy barrier existed between interacting mps and clay particles as demonstrated by the dlvo analysis results shown in fig 3d this resulted in the substantial aggregation of mps and clay particles which was consistent with the particle size distribution profiles comparing fig 3a and fig 3b the volume concentration of the surface layer was lower in the mp to clay system this being attributable to the co settling of mps with clay particles as a result of the adsorption of clay particles on mps the density of aggregates increased so more mps settled to the bottom 3 3 interactive effects of salinity and ha on aggregation fig 4 a and b show the particle size distribution of aggregates without and with clay particles as a function of ha concentrations under the influence of the low ha concentration a small degree of aggregation was observed from the particle size distribution in the surface layer in comparison with the pristine size distribution of mps fig s1a this was primarily due to the fact that the energy transferred to the system by shaking destabilizes the suspension in the suspension given that the particles were in close proximity they were subject to a repulsive energy barrier that prevented them from touching one another thus leading to stabilization in such cases if external energy is applied to the system the collision efficiency between particles will increase and some particles may overcome the repulsive energy barrier and coalesce langford et al 2022 nevertheless when the concentration of ha was 10 mg l aggregation behavior was inhibited since an extremely high repulsive energy barrier was established fig s2 because of the carboxylic acid and phenolic functional groups in ha it was negatively charged loosli et al 2013 it is also worth noting that the aromatic structure of ha can interact with mps through π π bonds alimi et al 2018 cai et al 2018 and in this case this resulted in more negative zeta potentials of mps table s2 ha can also be adsorbed on the surface of clay particles enhancing the negative zeta potential of clay particles table s2 li et al 2021a in this case the attachment of ha to the surface of mps and clay particles intensified the steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsive force between particles thus ultimately increasing the repulsive energy barrier when the concentration of ha in the mp to mp system was 1 mg l fig 4c larger particle sizes were observed in the surface layer with the increase of salinity suggesting the formation of a few aggregates however the particle size of the bottom layer maintained a consistent distribution regardless of salinity levels indicating that the aggregates were present only in the surface layer in the presence of 10 mg l ha fig 4e the aggregation in the surface layer seemed to disappear and almost no aggregation occurred in the system the particle size distribution in this system remained invariable with increasing salinity thus the stimulation of aggregation by salinity was insufficient to compensate for the inhibition of aggregation due to the high concentration of ha on the other hand when the concentration of ha in the mp to clay system was 1 mg l fig 4d the peak value of the bottom particle size distribution increased with increasing salinity while the particle size distribution in the surface layer remained stable indicating the presence of aggregates only in the bottom layer however the aggregation in the bottom layer eventually disappeared in the presence of 10 mg l ha fig 4f in the presence of high concentrations of ha it should be noted aggregation behavior was inhibited both with and without clay present in comparing fig 4c with fig 4d it can be observed that adding clay particles into mp suspensions promoted aggregation as supported by the dlvo analysis with the repulsive energy barriers between mps and clay particles being lower than those between interacting mps as illustrated in fig s2c and s2d furthermore the zeta potentials of the mps and clay particles became less negative with the increase of salinity resulting in weaker electrostatic repulsive force lower repulsive energy barrier and easier aggregation on the contrary the zeta potentials of mps and clay particles became more negative with the increase of ha concentration resulting in stronger electrostatic repulsive force higher repulsive energy barrier and more resistant aggregation as previously noted the effects of salinity and ha on aggregation behavior were found to be diametrically opposed mps were more likely to aggregate under high salinity and low ha conditions meanwhile the presence of clay was also found to contribute to the occurrence of aggregation 3 4 effect of wave conditions on the aggregation of mps and clay particles as noted in previous studies the energy contained in waves may have an impact on the aggregation behavior of the particles ji et al 2021a yang et al 2021 as such the homoaggregation of mps with mps and the heteroaggregation of mps with clay particles were investigated under mild and intense wave conditions for the mp to mp system under both wave conditions i e mild and intense fig 5 the higher volume concentration of particles appeared in the surface layer this due to the fact that pe particles are of a lower density than seawater thus most of the aggregates of mps floated in the surface layer and extremely few aggregates overcame the buoyancy force and were present in the bottom aqueous solution which was related to the size and shape of particles chubarenko et al 2016 as shown in fig 5a and b the particle size of aggregates became progressively larger as the mixing duration was extended from 0 5 to 12 h under mild wave conditions after 0 5 h of continuous mixing the particle size distribution in the mp to mp system ranged from 6 0 to 16 3 µm i e close to the size distribution of pristine mps on the other hand after a mixing duration of 12 h the particle size of the aggregates increased considerably up to 165 3 µm furthermore we noticed that the formation of large aggregates was accompanied by the appearance of trace amounts of fine particles in the bottom layer at a mixing duration of 12 h this may have been the result of a small percentage of particles being shattered into finer particles after the long period of subjection to mixing energy under intense wave conditions meanwhile fig 5c and d the particles initially coalesced into larger aggregates as the mixing duration increased but a subsequent decrease in particle size was observed while aggregation increased with a mixing duration of 3 9 h when the mixing duration was further extended to 12 h a reduction in particle size was observed attributable to the eventual fragmentation of the aggregates after a lengthy period of subjection to intense mixing energy the intense mixing energy caused the particles to disperse collide and then aggregate rapidly but the aggregates broke up shortly afterwards as time passed as displayed in fig 5d the particle size reduced to as low as 2 6 µm at a mixing duration of 12 h based on this result we can infer mps that have been present for a considerable period of time in nearshore waters with higher wave energy levels may have difficulty in coalescing the higher energy of collision due to the higher levels of mixing energy may cause the particles to shatter into particles smaller in size than the original ones in comparison to intense wave conditions fig 5c and d the overall volume concentration of particles and the volume concentrations of large size aggregates were greater under mild wave conditions fig 5a and b this observation suggests that mps aggregation behavior may be more prone to occur in nearshore waters with lower wave energy levels in our study under the simulated intense wave condition aggregation became less frequent and the majority of aggregates floated in the surface layers a phenomenon which would be more conducive to mps transporting over longer distances and affecting a wider area of the sea comparing fig 5a and c with fig 5b and d meanwhile the particle size distribution of aggregates in the bottom layer was broader over longer mixing durations this result suggests that the mps deposited on the seabed in the marine environment would be of a larger scale of size and this may result in more species of marine benthic organisms being endangered jâms et al 2020 fig 5e h shows the particle size distribution in both wave conditions for the mp to clay system as can be seen the volume concentration of particles peaked at 1 5 µl l in the surface layer while the volume concentration of particles reached 25 µl l in the bottom layer 17 times higher than the surface concentration this is attributable to the high density of clay particles causing them to settle gradually on the bottom after resting therefore the predominant aggregation in the surface layer could be considered as homoaggregation of mps whereas both homogeneous and heterogeneous aggregates of mps and clay particles were present in the bottom layer under mild wave conditions fig 5e and f a significant shift in particle size distribution toward larger values was observed in both the surface and bottom layers as the mixing duration increased this phenomenon indicates that the aggregates were distributed in both layers as shown in fig 5f particle sizes were concentrated in the range of 22 7 44 0 µm with extremely high concentrations at mixing durations of 6 12 h this range represented the dominant size of aggregates being deposited to the bottom under mild wave conditions moreover the aggregation profile of the mp to clay system under mild wave conditions was essentially the same as that of the mp to mp system suggesting that a similar aggregation scenario would be observed in low energy nearshore waters with or without the presence of clay particles the particle size variation in the mp to clay system under intense wave conditions is presented in fig 5g and h in the surface layer fig 6 g the particles coalesced into large size aggregates for mixing durations of 3 9 h and but then fragmented when the mixing duration was extended to 12 h i e the same phenomenon seen in fig 5c the aggregation profile in the surface layer was consistent with that observed in the case of the mp to mp system whereas the aggregation profile in the bottom layer clearly differed from that of the mp to mp system in the bottom layer of the mp to clay system fig 6h the particle size remained approximately within the range of 4 3 11 7 µm at various mixing durations and very few large size particles appeared this particle size range was close to the particle size of the pristine mps so we can infer that almost no homoaggregation of mps occurred in the bottom layer of the mp to clay system under the influence of intense mixing energy it can be concluded accordingly that nearshore waters with high wave energy levels are not favorable for aggregation of mps and clay particles therefore in high energy nearshore waters where a certain concentration of clay is present the effects of mp to clay heteroaggregation on benthic organisms can be expected to be concentrated mainly on small organisms moreover the observation of particle size distribution and volume concentration data in the mp to clay system revealed that intense wave conditions are still adverse to the aggregation behavior even in the presence of clay as was the case with the mp to mp system as discussed above 3 5 environmental implications for mp fate in the coastal zone fig s3 shows the calculated mass density of mp clay aggregates as a function of the number of clay particles adsorbed onto mps as can be seen when the number of clay particles adsorbed onto mps was less than 507 the density of the mp clay aggregates was lower than that of seawater i e 1030 kg m3 resulting in the aggregates floating whereas with an increase in clay particles adsorbing onto the mps the density of the mp clay aggregates exceeded that of seawater resulting in settling as these results suggest for low density mps only when combined with enough high density particles are they capable of overcoming buoyancy and sinking to the sea bottom the density of the mp clay aggregates was 1100 61 kg m3 when the point of saturation adsorption was reached the three dimensional surface plots presented in fig 6a and b illustrate the interactive effects of density and diameter on the terminal sinking velocity and mass the clay particles adsorbed on mps could attract other mps and then form an adsorption layer of clay particles ultimately forming clusters of various sizes to simplify the simulation it was assumed that clusters of different sizes were formed by mp clay aggregates of the same density as such the range of ρ a g g r e g a t e was from 1030 34 to 1100 61 kg m3 according to fig s3 the minimum value of d a g g r e g a t e meanwhile was considered to be the size of the individual mp clay aggregate 8 2 µm while the maximum value of d a g g r e g a t e was considered to be the size of the largest aggregate occurring in the bottom layer of the mp to clay system i e 100 µm as noted in section 3 4 above as shown in fig 6a the terminal sinking velocity was found to be sensitive to both factors with the density of mp clay aggregates having the greater effect on the terminal sinking velocity the velocity reached its maximum value as the density and diameter increased as shown in fig 6b the mass of mp clay aggregates was extremely sensitive to the diameter factor while only a slight effect was observed as a result of increasing density accordingly we can infer that the mass of aggregates ultimately settling on the seafloor will be governed largely by their size the terminal deposition of mp clay aggregates is shown in fig 6c and d as shown in the fig 6c when the horizontal velocity of the current flow was slow i e 0 1 m s high density aggregates were deposited at a distance of 5 25 m and low density aggregates were deposited significantly further away at a distance of 100 400 m on the other hand when the horizontal velocity of the current flow was fast i e 1 m s high density aggregates were deposited at a distance of 50 250 m and low density aggregates could migrate and settle down as distant as 3 5 km away traveling with the current fig 6d in other words the higher the horizontal velocity of current flow was the further away the mp clay aggregates were deposited moreover both a decrease in diameter and a decrease in density were found to be factors in the terminal deposition being further away compared with fig s4 the effect of density on settling distance was more pronounced as can be seen when the density of the aggregates was close to that of seawater the settlement was very slow while a slight increase in density resulted in a rapid reduction in settling distance according to the terminal deposition plots the circle symbols in plots representing mp clay aggregates became denser with a decrease in distance this indicates that most of the aggregates were prone to deposit in areas close to the shoreline and that in areas closer to the shoreline more aggregates settled on the seafloor an result consistent with previous studies zhang 2017 4 conclusions interactions between mps and clay particles are likely to occur in coastal waters since clay particles are prevalent there in this study we explored the aggregation behavior of mps with and without clay particles in the nearshore environment observing both the aggregation of mps and the adsorption of clay particles on mps the mp to clay system was found to have a lower volume concentration of particles in the surface layer compared to mp to mp system as our findings suggest the presence of clay particles may help mps to overcome buoyancy and carry mps to settle down moreover increased mp to clay ratios may enhance the interaction between mps and clay particles resulting in the formation of large aggregates on the other hand excessive concentrations of clay were found to inhibit the aggregation of mps with clay particles this being attributable to the increased chance of collision between clay particles and correspondingly an increased likelihood of self aggregation meanwhile we investigated the aggregation mechanism corresponding to the surface potential and energy barrier of particles the aggregation behaviors of mps in particular heteroaggregation between mps and clay particles were found to clearly increase with increasing salinity this effect was governed by the reduction in electrostatic repulsive force in turn due to charge neutralization and electrical double layer compression ha concentration in contrast was found to have the opposite effect the attachment of ha on the surface of particles intensified the repulsive energy barrier and hindered the aggregation of the particles nevertheless the external energy enabled the particles to overcome the repulsive energy barrier and coalesce moreover the low energy associated with mild wave conditions was favorable for the aggregation of mps and clay particles in contrast sustained high energy under intense wave conditions was found to be detrimental to the occurrence of aggregation behavior and the aggregates were prone to fragmentation even if particles coalesced into large clusters mp clay aggregates with lower density than seawater tended to spread with the current over longer distances and to affect a wider area of the sea only in combination with a sufficient concentration of high density particles could the mps overcome buoyancy and settle aggregates with smaller diameters and densities tended to be more likely to settle farther with density being the more critical factor of the two in determining the terminal deposition a high horizontal velocity of current flow was also found to cause mps to drift and to be deposited to the seafloor further afield aggregates tended to be more intensive with a greater mass in areas close to the shoreline which was likely to be the sink for most mps ultimately the fate of mps under other coastal conditions can be further
