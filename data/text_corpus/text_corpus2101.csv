10505,in agriculture soilless cropping represents the most suitable cultivation technique apt to achieve a theoretical 100 efficiency of water and nutrient use this is possible through a high control of input streams in the cultivation system soilless cultivation indeed allows high precision in nutrient and water management so that particular agronomic techniques which are risky in other cultivation systems e g nutrient depletion or the maintenance of low nutrient concentrations in the root zone can be managed more safely under soilless conditions even in the so called open free drain cycles water and nutrient losses can be minimized by the combination of sensing technologies and nutrient delivery strategies aiming at zero emissions however soilless cropping allows collection and reuse of the drainage in closed growing systems thereby avoiding or minimizing water and nutrient losses into the environment the main challenge when managing closed systems in southern europe conditions is usually the progressive salinization of the recirculating solution because of saline irrigation waters often available in many in coastal areas of the mediterranean the use of alternative water sources like rainwater or desalinated water can prevent this problem but their availability is limited advanced recirculation strategies have demonstrated a high potential for reusing the solution under saline conditions with optimal use and minimal discharge of nutrients hence there is currently enough knowledge to support a larger application of closed soilless systems in mediterranean conditions on the other hand proper choices in terms of cultivation facilities and structures and plant material can be relevant to achieve high water and nutrient use efficiency the main relevant techniques e g nutrient solution management strategies and right choice of planting material and technologies e g sensing technologies and greenhouse structures to minimize water and nutrient losses from soilless grown vegetable crops in southern europe are reviewed in this paper abbreviations cl closed loop ccs cascade cropping systems dft deep flow technique dss decision support

efficiency precision agriculture salinity vegetables 1 introduction soilless cropping is mostly not to say completely related to protected cultivation in southern europe although open air cultivation is also possible in this region under soilless conditions fruit bearing vegetables are mainly cultivated on substrates like coir perlite pumice and rockwool and irrigated by drip irrigation and only occasionally by subirrigation while leafy vegetables and herbs are preferably grown in floating systems or deep flow technique dft and secondarily in nutrient film technique nft while only occasionally in aeroponics although many growing systems have been tested in the past only the above mentioned were found suitable for commercial purposes however soilless culture includes a plethora of different cultivation systems and technical solutions nutrient and water management strategies and various technologies that can influence much the expectations in terms of emissions losses by nutrient solution discharge or leachate and water and nutrient use efficiencies wue and nue respectively this heterogeneity must be taken in consideration for the identification of strategies and solutions apt to minimize water and nutrient losses in soilless cropping in this review we will refer to the main categories of substrate culture soilless scs or liquid culture soilless lcs which also includes aeroponics while the term hydroponics will be used without further specifications however intending it as a subcategory of soilless systems in some cultivation environments the use of substrate in scs for fruit bearing vegetables production is preferred to lcs because the presence of a solid growing medium represents a buffer to prevent or limit possible water and nutrient stress other than temperature fluctuations in the root zone this former aspect is indeed highly relevant in southern europe where mediterranean climate causes high evapotranspiration et rate at canopy level especially in low tech greenhouses where natural or forced ventilation is often adopted for the control of high air temperature katsoulas and stanghellini 2019 for the same reason dft is preferred among other lcs systems since it shows a buffering water and nutrient capacity comparable even with soil cultivation in southern europe spain italy france and greece are the major producers of vegetables under protected cultivation in spain the highest area of soilless vegetable production is in the plain of almería 32 000 ha covered with parral type and multi tunnel polyethylene greenhouses out of 60 000 ha for the entire country where the total surface occupied by these soilless systems is estimated at 3 000 ha while other greenhouse areas are of minor importance in terms of surface devoted to soilless incrocci et al 2020 in the year 2000 soilless production in almería was carried out mostly using perlite 52 and rockwool 45 substrates while natural fibers were of minor importance conversely in more recent years the percentage of substrate based on coconut fibers increased up to 32 to the detriment of rockwool garcía garcía et al 2016 valera et al 2016 in italian commercial greenhouses soilless production accounts for 9 of roughly 33 000 ha incrocci et al 2020 nicoletto et al 2018 tomato crops mostly transplanted on mineral perlite or organic coconut fibers substrates and fertigated through drip irrigation ranks first among very few other fruit vegetables most of the production is managed by free drain irrigation control with high 20 30 leaching fraction lf to avoid salt accumulation in the root zone due to the presence of saline ions that often abound in coastal areas pardossi et al 2006 in greece 300 ha cyprus 40 ha and in mediterranean france 330 ha soilless vegetables mainly cultivated in scs and sometimes in lcs are of minor importance over a total protected cultivated area of 7 300 ha incrocci et al 2020 the majority 80 is managed by free drain systems except in france where the use of closed system has increased significantly in recent years most greenhouses are multi tunnel soft plastic polyethylene and single multispan structures and very few are covered with glass or polycarbonate in greece and cyprus rockwool and coconut fibers are the main substrates followed by perlite and pumice and used under growth bags or handmade soilless culture structures the main vegetable crops are tomato cucumber followed by eggplant lettuce strawberry and peppers froutonea 2012 tzortzakis 2014 in some countries of southern europe especially spain soilless cropping reached the highest popularity during the 1980 and 1990 decades followed by a drastic decrease garcía garcía et al 2016 there are some explanations for this decrease such as the extended adoption of grafting which resolves problems related to root diseases the competition with organic production systems which have to be done in soil and increasing regulations on substrate disposal however the phenomenon is complex and behind practical issues there are also many other cultural and educational reasons nonetheless intensive systems such as soilless cropping merit high attention in southern europe as there are many excellent brands producing under soilless conditions their potential is huge in terms of sustainability and under the perspective of circular horticulture and their adoption is seen as a solution to partially face the food requirements of the next generations sambo et al 2019 soilless culture can indeed boost intensive cropping systems with impressive wue and nue and very high product yield and quality high efficiency can be achieved in scs through the adoption of closed loop cl systems where the nutrient solution ns drained from the root zone is collected and reused alternatively in open free drain loop ol systems that drainage is not recycled and lost thereby causing a waste of water and nutrients some of the drained nutrients especially no3 and phosphates and some micronutrients may become a threat for the environment and a concern for human and animal health if accumulated in excess in the ecosystem it must also be underlined that the ns may contain variable concentrations of plant protection products eventually discharged into the environment with the drainage water vermeulen et al 2017 however the option of cl is only occasionally adopted in soilless systems for vegetable production in the mediterranean area for example in the plain of almeria only roughly 12 of soilless production is devoted to the ns recirculation valera et al 2016 along with environmental concerns and the possible impact that water and nutrient losses may have on production costs there are also many other issues to be faced by soilless growers for example those related to marketing and legislations or climate changes that can drastically influence produce yield and quality in low tech mediterranean greenhouse cultivations the exigency of producing high quality vegetables with environmentally friendly approaches is nowadays more perceived as a priority by consumers that may strongly influence the market by their choices therefore what can appear as a constrain could turn into an opportunity for the sector for example it has been observed that the consumers of vegetables are more incline to associate the idea of healthy and sustainable productions than in other agri food sectors verain et al 2016 although they are in general not available to pay extra money for product environmental sustainability beside strengths and opportunities in this work we highlight the main bottlenecks of soilless production and reviewed the most suitable and promising techniques and technologies that reduce water and nutrient losses from soilless cropping in southern europe 2 key points to minimize water and nutrient losses from soilless cropping crops growing in substrate are commonly irrigated with excess ns to avoid nutrient and water deficits while limiting excess salt accumulation sonneveld and voogt 2009 in mediterranean vegetable production it is generally accepted that up to 20 30 of the irrigation water 30 40 of absorbed water can be lost in drip irrigated systems or even more if poor quality water is available for irrigation pardossi et al 2006 along with this phenomenon a large waste of water and nutrients and higher production costs inevitably occurs in ol culture thus decreasing both the environmental and economical sustainability of soilless cropping for example considering a water uptake of 400 500 l m 2 for a 9 month tomato crop in unheated greenhouse variability depending on cultivars and geographic area up to 120 200 l m 2 of water would be lost in free drain systems with a parallel loss of 170 335 34 95 165 435 kg ha 1 of n p and k respectively i e for n p k concentration of 10 12 0 9 1 5 4 5 7 mmol l 1 in the ns depending on cultivar therefore when ols are adopted for irrigation in scs the most two important key factors are the correct irrigation schedule and ns composition in fact in fertigated cropping systems water and nutrient supplies are mutual and can influence each other in terms of excesses or deficits and thus use efficiency a precise control of irrigation is therefore strategic to limit water and nutrient losses from soilless cropping such a goal can be achieved with high precision nowadays by the adoption of tools to estimate crop water and nutrient uptake through i sensing technologies see section 3 1 and or ii simulation and prediction tools see section 3 2 incrocci et al 2017 however the absolute quantity of nutrient lost with the drainage water also depends on the concentration of salts dissolved in the ns when fertilizers salts are provided at concentrations higher than the actual crop uptake concentration the ratio between the quantity of any ion depleted in the root zone and the volume of water evapotranspirated in the same time unit sonneveld and voogt 2009 an accumulation of solutes will inevitably occurs in the root zone this causes an increase in electrical conductivity ec that in turn can be reduced by increasing lf in a never ending loop or by reducing the ec of the supplied ns therefore providing nutrients concentrations equal to the actual ion uptake concentrations means having a system in a steady state condition although many techniques and technologies are now available to achieve the theoretical zero emissions the key word yet remains optimization since some emissions are physiological necessary under operational conditions it must be underlined that under an acceptable range some extra supply of water and nutrients is in the practice functional to overcome problems related to crop heterogeneity in terms of equipment functionality and crop physiological needs in fact some extra lf is strategic to compensate for uneven ns distribution due to possible dripper and substrate inefficiency or crop water and nutrient uptake due to microclimatic differences in the greenhouse in this regard much research has been developed in northern european countries since the 1980 s however in southern europe higher et rates are correlated with lower values of actual nutrient uptake concentration compared with colder climates where crop et is much lower in closed greenhouses incrocci et al 2017 katsoulas and stanghellini 2019 for example n uptake concentrations in soilless tomato have been reported as much lower in spain and italy massa et al 2010 thompson et al 2013 compared with the netherlands voogt 1993 a further aspect to be considered is the natural presence of nutrients in growing media that possibly may support plant nutrition at least partially barrett et al 2016 massa et al 2019a this extra nutrient budget should be considered for the correct computation of an equilibrated nutrient balance to avoid plant nutrient imbalances and optimize nutrient inputs and outputs in the growing system closed loop systems provide the best performing solution to deal with the issue of water and nutrient losses in soilless cropping thus ensuring a low impact on environment and production costs see sections 3 3 4 1 and 4 2 the main difficulty in recirculating water in southern europe is due to the presence of saline ions e g na and cl which are often present in the irrigation water at concentrations higher than the actual crop uptake concentration thereby increasing ec as they accumulate in the recirculating ns although the benefits of recycling water in an irrigation system are strongly dependent on water quality it has been demonstrated that also when saline water is available for irrigation e g in presence of salt tolerant vegetables like tomato the adoption of semi cls where the ns is discharged only partially during the cultivation cycle to recover suitable cultivation conditions see section 4 1 may be a successful alternative massa et al 2010 montesano et al 2010 a further strategic factor for limiting water and nutrient losses in soilless cropping lies in the correct choice of substrate and containers and the selection of appropriate species and cultivars or rootstock as a function of their tolerance or resistance to abiotic stresses i e salinity presence of toxic ions and other substances that would require high lf fraction in sensitive crops see section 4 4 for example it has been demonstrated that the addition of some organic and inorganic materials in the substrate like compost biochar or zeolite can alleviate the detrimental effects of excess salinity in the irrigation water used for substrate grown vegetables barret et al 2016 3 management technologies for minimizing water and nutrient losses 3 1 sensing technologies for crop monitoring and automation sensing technologies can be adopted to gather data from multiple sources the subsequent analysis of collected data is functional to drive decisions and or automate the management of the cultivation process these technologies are fully included in the concepts of smart and precision agriculture recently recognized as a tremendous opportunity for improving soilless cultivation sambo et al 2019 several experiences recently performed in southern europe report the feasibility of such an approach with interesting achievements in terms of water and fertilizer use optimization in soilless cultivation table 1 for example zamora izquierdo et al 2019 developed and tested in a commercial tomato greenhouse in southeastern spain a smart farming low cost iot internet of things platform specifically designed for soilless culture reporting savings of 30 in water consumption and up to 80 in some fertilizers compared with ol system there are different approaches to use sensor data for the management of irrigation and nutrient supply the simplest method is to turn irrigation on and off based on whether a target sensed parameter is below or above a user defined set point e g substrate moisture level and ec or plant stress parameters other approaches which are discussed elsewhere in this paper see section 3 2 are based on the modeling of crop water or nutrient requirement as a function of environmental conditions monitored through sensors or specific crop parameters therefore basic technologies to monitor common environmental parameters like for example air temperature will be not considered in this section since ol or semi cl systems are largely adopted in southern european soilless cultivation avoiding leaching beyond what is strictly necessary can significantly reduce environmental impact accurate monitoring of leachate solution parameters in particular ns volume ec and ionic composition through appropriate sensing technologies can help to reduce leaching rates to the bare minimum a large use of automatic irrigation scheduling based on lf control has been reported for greenhouses in southeastern spain where several studies were conducted focusing on a fertigation control tray system urrestarazu 2013 this method consists in the adoption of a tray on which cultivation units most commonly grow bags or rockwool slabs are placed equipped with a drainage tank an electrical signal triggers irrigation based on the level of the drainage in the tank an evolution of this system in which the measurements of leachate volumes are analyzed by a proportional integral derivative pid algorithm has been recently introduced and successfully tested on soilless tomato rodríguez et al 2017 these authors concluded that the positive performance and the low cost of such equipment for irrigation control would result in significant cost savings if implemented at commercial scale the application of an interesting irrigation management strategy based on the use of the fertigation control tray method combined with a leaching solution ec based irrigation scheduling adjusted daily to obtain a proper lf as a function of a pre set ec has been reported on perlite grown cucumber in spain sánchez guerrero et al 2009 monitoring the weight of the container plant substrate system through appropriate equipment provides a real time estimation of substrate water content variations due to et a weighing gutter system was developed and successfully used for improved irrigation management of soilless tomato and cucumber de graaf et al 2004d real time monitoring of water status and other substrate parameters in the root zone is considered one of the most promising and feasible approaches for precision irrigation and nutrient supply control in greenhouse soilless production pardossi et al 2009 van iersel et al 2013v this is due to the current availability of reliable and relatively low cost sensors and technologies supporting the implementation of wireless sensor actuator networks making objective decisions and automating irrigation based on root zone water status sensing relies on a simple principle the water content in the substrate decreases because of et sensors can detect this change and irrigation is automatically activated through actuator devices when a predetermined set point value is reached resulting in on demand irrigation this approach complies with the assumption that optimal irrigation management should supply water and fertilizers in the case of fertigated crops just when the plants require it the determination of correct irrigation set points is a key factor to support optimal crop performance and improved use of water resources and it should be based on specific information regarding the effects of substrate water availability on plants moreover it must be considered that the matric potentials in real cultivation conditions could vary from those determined from the moisture retention curves obtained in laboratory conditions due at least partially to the typical hysteresis of substrate moisture curves naasz et al 2005 in practice for irrigation management moisture retention curves available for most of commercially used substrates can be used to define proper irrigation set points however a certain amount of water exceeding the actual crop evapotranspiration is needed to ensure watering uniformity in this regard sensing matric potential through tensiometers can be adopted for automatic irrigation control in soilless conditions the use of tensiometers was combined with closed cycle subirrigation with low concentration ns to optimize water use efficiency and avoid ns discharge into the environment compared with traditional ol drip in both soilless tomato montesano et al 2010 and green bean bouchaaba et al 2015 tensiometer based automatic irrigation control was also used to impose specific irrigation set points corresponding to different substrate water availability conditions enhancing some tomato fruit quality traits montesano et al 2015 a novel dielectric tensiometer specifically designed for use in substrates with an operational range of 0 7 to 2 5 kpa matric potential integrated with a precision pid based irrigation controller was successfully tested on a cultivation of soilless strawberry grown on coir allowing precise matching of water delivery to plant needs goodchild et al 2018 main drawbacks of tensiometer use are related to the need of a careful positioning to ensure good contact between the porous tip and the substrate and of frequent maintenance pardossi et al 2009 at the moment a great interest is directed towards dielectric sensors for the measurement of soilless substrate volumetric water content vwc nemali et al 2007 dielectric sensors combining the measurement of multiple substrate parameters vwc ec and temperature are now available at reasonable prices for these instruments calibration equations for many of the most used substrates can be found in the literature along with related practical indications on how to manage the effects of changes in physical properties of soilless substrates due to different mix ratios or root system growth on the sensor reading quality rhie and kim 2017 kang et al 2019 using vwc sensors combined with the adoption of proper irrigation set points corresponding to optimal substrate water availability conditions proved to be a successful approach for optimal fertigation management of important soilless grown vegetable crops significant water savings increased wue and almost no leaching was obtained with moisture sensor based compared with timer based irrigation in ol soilless lettuce montesano et al 2016 automatic irrigation based on substrate vwc and ec sensing was used on coir grown tomato resulting in automatic adjustment of irrigation scheduling matching fluctuations of plant water needs as a result of climatic condition variations over the growing cycle and better control of leaching compared to a timer based schedule choi et al 2013 an innovative cloud connected system for wireless sensor based smart irrigation management was used on basil grown in a perlite coco substrate under mediterranean greenhouse conditions allowing for a reduction in leaching to values considered a goal for efficient irrigation management in ol soilless culture i e 10 to 15 montesano et al 2018 for the above sensors spatial heterogeneity in crop water demand and limited number of sensors as typically occurs in commercial greenhouse conditions have been posed as an issue in principle observations on spatial variability in crop transpiration can be used to develop sophisticated and precise irrigation control systems potentially able to lead to more uniform conditions for the plants however to fully exploit spatial measurements through highly dense sensor networks the actuators would need to be developed in such a distributed and advanced way to ensure the same punctual distribution ferentinos et al 2017 it has been documented how the variations in microclimate inside greenhouses may cause corresponding variations in the water content of soilless substrate profiles the water content value to be used as set point for irrigation and the number of sensors needed in a greenhouse should be evaluated based on the greenhouse conditions the crop species and the growing medium as a rule of thumb large microclimate variation within the greenhouse or narrower range of acceptable growing substrate vwc imply that more sensors are needed further research is indeed required to provide more evidences on optimal irrigation set points for different crops and on the number of soil moisture sensors needed within a greenhouse of a given size and magnitude of microclimate variation henderson et al 2018 plant sensing real time monitoring of specific physiological parameters or processes aimed to early detection of plant stress conditions has long been proposed as a possible approach for irrigation scheduling or as a feed back control strategy in high frequency on demand irrigation systems jones 2004 however due to several disadvantages of this approach e g inability to indicate how much water to apply relatively high equipment cost altered sensitivity due to improper sensor installation automated sensing systems still in a development stage plant sensing based fertigation management is still mostly confined to research applications on the other hand taking advantage of new technological advancements in the implementation of wireless sensor networks a combination of sensing technologies for plant and environment based parameters now seems to be a promising strategy for efficient automatic irrigation scheduling an automation system for water and n deﬁcit detection based on hyperspectral machine vision technologies for determination of spectral indices was recently tested in a soilless tomato crop revealing promising results for developing control strategies for sustainable greenhouse production elvanidi et al 2018 similarly katsoulas et al 2019 used spectral data transformed into vegetation indexes to detect salinity stress in soilless tomato outlining the potential of these sensing technologies for optimal fertigation management other plant sensing techniques and technologies to monitor plant n status have been specifically reviewed by padilla et al 2020 the availability of sensing technologies able to assist growers in the control of ns parameters is a critical aspect in most cases ph and ec of the recirculating ns and of the drainage are the only parameters monitored by hand meters or in case of greenhouse operations equipped with more advanced technologies with on line sensors to collect data on crop nutrient status electrical conductivity is generally used to operate also automatically adjustments of the recirculating ns and or of the leaching rate through modifications of irrigation scheduling in this context much interest is currently devoted to ion selective electrodes as a possible tool for online monitoring of the solutions many studies have been conducted although some impairments to a broader promotion and use of these sensors still exist currently portable analyzers are generally used to measure on site the concentrations of individual ions although scarce availability of sensors for some elements represents a limitation technical problems are still related to the accuracy of nutrient concentration determination strongly affected by signal drift reduced sensitivity over time inappropriate calibration sampling procedures and probes maintenance sambo et al 2019 interesting studies have been recently conducted to solve some technical problems and successful tests aimed to incorporate real time ion concentration measurement in soilless cultivation procedures are reported that open new perspectives for future implementation of these tools cho et al 2018 domingues et al 2012 rius ruiz et al 2014 3 2 simulation models and decision support systems as an alternative to direct measurements through sensing technologies water and nutrient requirements and eventually emissions can be estimated from simulation tools based on modelling approaches in soilless systems simulation models to estimate crop water and ion uptake and dynamics in the root zone can then be applied for making decisions in terms of nutrient and water management in soilless crops incrocci et al 2017 pardossi et al 2006 sambo et al 2019 output data can be used differently depending on user s needs and type and scope of simulations running simulations for on time management will mainly have the aim of supporting growers during the cultivation cycle for making decisions over short periods 3 5 days to one week or following the crop day by day this kind of information may consist of i estimation of the correct lf to maintain suitable conditions in the root zone while minimizing nutrient and water waste in ol systems ii forecasting dates to discharge the ns e g in semi cl which are also essential for planning the application of plant protection products vermeulen et al 2017 iii adjustment of the ns concentration and irrigation scheduling model based predictions for off line analyses might instead provide information for making decisions over longer periods such simulations may provide many outputs like water and nutrient non nutrient uptake and leaching concentration of nutrient non nutrient and ec in the root zone for different scenarios simulated basing on historical data or environmental condition forecasting this can be helpful for example to make decisions on proper crop selection structural investments equipment choices and strategies to face possible constraints that will limit the economic and environmental sustainability of soilless cropping considering irrigation as the main vector for plant nutrition in fertigated crops simulation models for water requirements have frequently been proposed for the optimized management of mediterranean soilless crops many of these models are based on simplified versions of the penman monteith equation katsoulas and stanghellini 2019 and have been proposed for several vegetable crops under mediterranean soilless conditions like cucumber medrano et al 2005 pepper ahn and son 2019 and tomato carmassi et al 2007 martínez ruiz et al 2019 massa et al 2011 battista et al 2017 proposed a modified version of the tomgro model whose outputs were used to simulate the water uptake of three different tomato cultivars through the baille s equation katsoulas and stanghellini 2019 a detailed description of the main simulation equations for the estimation of et adapted to greenhouse cultivation is reported in incrocci et al 2020 yet probabilistic approaches based on a dynamic bayesian network to simulate plant growth and et of leafy vegetables have recently been proposed for lettuce grown hydroponically kocian et al 2020 however under saline growing conditions often occurring in coastal cultivated areas of southern europe crop water uptake may vary as a function of the root zone salinity levels dde pascale et al 2019 as already mentioned saline water for irrigation is a common problem in southern europe that forces the use of higher lf in soilless crops see section 2 which affects plant nutrition and physiology dde pascale et al 2019 therefore the prediction of saline ion accumulation and crop absorption is essential to avoid excess water and nutrient runoff carmassi et al 2005 proposed a model to simulate salinity build up due to na accumulation in the root zone and ec level for the optimization of partial discharge of the ns when the salinity level surpasses a pre established set point in successive studies the same authors proposed a regression model to simulate crop evapotranspiration of tomato grown on rockwool in a mediterranean greenhouse carmassi et al 2007 in these studies a linear relationship between na uptake concentration and the concentration of the same ion in the recirculating ns was found using the same approach savvas et al 2005 found non linear exponential relationships to simulate na and cl accumulation and their influence on water uptake in soilless grown cucumber sodium and cl uptake concentration as previously defined see section 2 were considered as the guide parameters to simulate their accumulation in different soilless grown vegetables such as tomato katsoulas et al 2015 massa et al 2011 pepper savvas et al 2008 melon neocleous and savvas 2016 and zucchini neocleous and savvas 2017 for effective simulations specie specific parameterizations are often required for example katsoulas et al 2015 highlighted the need for different model calibrations with different tomato cultivars in the case of na simulations however the same authors concluded that the proposed model was helpful in minimizing nutrient and water discharge in semi cl systems in comparison with ols alternatively more mechanistic approaches have been considered to simulate na and cl absorption and accumulation in the root zone of soilless crops silberbush and ben asher 2001 silberbush et al 2005 apart from the influence that saline ions may have on crop et and other plant physiological aspects at the operational level the importance of their dynamics in the root zone lies in the contribution of these ions to overall ec however ec variation in the root zone is the result of nutrient and non nutrient composition fig 1 and thus to have a more complete picture for optimized nutrient management the simulation of all elements should be accomplished ahn and son 2019 massa et al 2011 savvas and gruda 2018 models based on the concept of ionic uptake concentration have largely been proposed also to simulate concentration variations in the root zone and uptake of nutrient ions in several vegetable crops kläring et al 1999 massa et al 2011 savvas 2002 other simple regression models have been parameterized to simulate nutrient absorption in soilless grown vegetable crops under mediterranean conditions pardossi et al 2004 2006 other authors proposed more mechanistic approaches to simulate the absorption of essential nutrients in soilless grown vegetables anastasiou et al 2005 the michaelis menten s equation and modified versions was suggested as a reference model to simulate the plant intake of different nutrient ions as a function of their external concentration mathieu et al 1999 such equations have been calibrated for several crops like pepper ahn and son 2019 tomato bar yosef et al 2004 silberbush and ben asher 2001 and lettuce silberbush et al 2005 wheeler et al 1998 grown in soilless systems many of the above models had as final aim the simulation of ec variations in the root zone because it represents a guide parameter for the operational management of the ns savvas and gruda 2018 raviv et al 2019 urrestarazu and garcía 2000 for example experiments with pepper grown in a cl system showed how the application of simulation models which simulate ec in the recirculating ns can be successfully applied to limit nutrient waste and for a better more stable control of ec in the root zone ahn and son 2019 other approaches to simulate nutrient uptake or ion concentration in the root zone of soilless grown plants were based on plant nutrient demand driven by growth combined with nutrient concentration in plant tissues le bot et al 1998 mathieu et al 1999 empirical parameters like the ion uptake concentration may indeed vary as a function of environmental conditions phenological phases and species and even cultivars but as matter of fact are strictly linked to fertigation practice since are representative of the actual concentration of nutrients to be maintained in the ns however ion and water uptake are basically uncoupled phenomena therefore modelling nutrient uptake as a function of water flux would be not soundly correct from a physiological point of view le bot et al 1998 to this end some authors simulated plant nutrient and water uptake as a function of plant growth to finally obtain a dynamic nutrient uptake concentration martínez ruiz et al 2019 probabilistic models based on complex nonlinear data collection have also been adopted to simulate nutrient concentration in cl soilless culture lstm long short term memory algorithms were for example used as a deep learning approach for the simulation of the daily variation of nutrient concentration in the root zone of soilless pepper moon et al 2019 different equations and algorithms developed with specific targets or for the simulation of single variables can be integrated into more complete tools or decision support systems dsss for water and nutrient simulation the dss hortimed was developed for optimal management of fertilizer injection of soilless crops grown under mediterranean conditions with special attention paid towards saline growing environments recommendations provided by the software included operational management to limit crop environmental impact and production costs anastasiou et al 2005 massa et al 2011 proposed a dss to simulate nutrient and non nutrient variations in the root zone for the estimation of water and nutrient use and runoff of ol cl and semi cl systems managed with different strategies to face common problems arising from the use of saline water in soilless cropping under mediterranean conditions this work provided the basis for the development of the more complex dss hydrotools incrocci et al 2012 https www wur nl en research results projects and programmes euphoros calculation tools hydrotools htm composed of a module solnutri for the preparation of stock nss and the upgraded version of the software simulhydro incrocci et al 2008 the proposed dss can operate for on time management or off line scenario analyses among other outputs the dss calculates when the recycling ns must be replaced in semi cl systems to optimize ns discharge yet the dss can be run to compare different fertigation strategies system layouts water qualities or crop species with diverse nutrient requirements salinity tolerance or affinity to the ballast ions contained in the irrigation water similar scenario analyses can be carried out using the dss proposed by ferentinos et al 2003 as a tool for optimal water management in soilless culture under saline conditions a further example is the dss hortsyst which combines n uptake simulated as a function of plant growth and nutrient concentration with crop et for the dynamic calculation of n uptake concentration in soilless tomato crops martínez ruiz et al 2019 simulation components are however not the only prerogative of dsss for soilless culture dsss may also involve different tools and integrate different techniques and technologies for the optimized water and nutrient management of soilless crops varying from simulation to sensing tools see section 3 1 applied for different purposes and with different management strategies incrocci et al 2017 for example a web based application system for improved irrigation scheduling of soilless crops based on an algorithm using data from a sensor network in the greenhouse was tested in commercial farms in greece resulting in 100 increases of wue and nue katsoulas et al 2017 goumopoulos et al 2014 designed an adaptable dss integrated with a wireless sensor actuator network to implement autonomous cl zone specific irrigation decisions were made based on both plant and environmental conditions and a machine learning module was also included the application of the system on a soilless strawberry cultivation resulted in significant water saving and wue increase compared with irrigation based on empirical user s experiences the integration of simulation tools with actual measurements in the so called corrective approaches for nutrient management has been reported to be effective in vegetable crop fertigation incrocci et al 2017 thompson et al 2018 following this strategy soilless management based on simulations or fixed protocols prescriptive approaches can be corrected during the cultivation through a periodical reset with real world data such as actual water or nutrient uptake or actual composition of the recycling ns although the potential of simulation models and dss has been largely documented in theory and assessed in many experimental trials in practice there is a lack of comparative works where soilless crops are completely managed with the sole support of dss and automations of soilless equipment completely based on dss outputs the implementation level of these tools in soilless cultivation of southern europe could indeed be improved 3 3 facilities and structural solutions for efficient water and nutrient recirculation in lcs systems roots develop directly in the ns which has to be supplied continuously or intermittently with a high frequency to prevent water stress so that recirculation of the solution is compulsory in order to avoid a huge waste of water and fertilizers savvas and gruda 2018 scs systems instead require spaced irrigation events depending on crop demand and the water retention of the substrate these are conceptually open systems since the substrate acts as a reservoir of water and air for the roots and irrigation can be adjusted to minimize leaching but they have been converted into closed systems by placing the containers or slabs with substrate on gutters for drainage collection and installing tanks for its accumulation a disinfection system as a security measure and an injection and mixing system for the incorporation of the drainage to the ns hence an additional investment is necessary in this case for recirculation in spain for example it has been reported a cost of 72 000 ha 1 as first investment and 800 ha 1 per year for the maintenance of closed system facilities life drainuse 2019 as yield is limited by non optimal climatic conditions inside the passive climate greenhouses typical of the mediterranean area the repercussion of the additional investment per unit of production is significantly higher than in the high tech greenhouses typical of other latitudes the selection of materials and components necessary for recirculation has to be done very carefully in order to minimize and amortize the investment by saving water and nutrients as previously discussed cl systems have to face the issue of salinity build up in the recirculating ns that could be partially mitigated by using an adequate growing system subirrigation watering method promotes the upwards movement of water in the substrate due to capillarity while concentrating salts in the upper layer this can promote slower salinization of the recirculating solution in comparison with conventional drip irrigation and lower runoff requirements with an increase in wue and nue incrocci et al 2006 furthermore as the solution is usually soaked into the pot pathogens are not able to move in the reverse direction and contaminate the circulating solution which reduces the risk of spreading pathogens molitor 1990 interesting applications of subirrigation have been reported in mediterranean conditions for different crops bouchaaba et al 2015 incrocci et al 2006 montesano et al 2010 2015 rouphael and colla 2009 although sometimes lower productions were reported due to excess salt accumulation in the substrate martinetti et al 2008 on the other hand the accumulation of salts in the substrate can restrict its life span a split root growing system could be also used to promote high accumulation of salts in a part of the root environment while maintaining low salinity in the other part without affecting yield sonneveld and voogt 1990 a splitting scheme of nutrient supply to plants via fertigation as an effective way to prevent increased salinity levels resulted in 25 nutrient savings compared with a conventional fertigation system alvarenga et al 2013 fernandes et al 2007 although this system would need further development before using it commercially it could increase wue and nue when using low quality water by reducing emissions rainwater is an excellent source of water for recirculation and can be easily recovered from greenhouses unfortunately rainfall in the mediterranean basin is not frequent enough to completely satisfy crop water requirements and it is unevenly distributed during the year not optimally meeting the water demand pattern of a crop this makes necessary to build ponds big enough for rainwater recovery which are costly and occupies space so that an extensive use of rainfall is not always feasible especially in areas with high greenhouse concentration optimal dimensioning of the storage capacity can be currently achieved by using models based on long term data sets of climatological parameters and datasets or models for crop water uptake thompson et al 2018 a disadvantage of rainwater use for irrigation is the possible dispersion in the crop of spores of pathogenic fungi like phytium spp which are present in the dust accumulated on greenhouse covers sánchez et al 2001 to reduce this risk different disinfection systems can be used however the development in the pond of certain aquatic macrophytes can be promoted as an environmentally friendly and low cost method having an inhibitory effect on bacterial density and phytium propagule viability juan et al 2014 additionally aquatic plants can make a satisfactory control of phytoplankton in the water bonachela et al 2013 another source of high quality water to boost cls in mediterranean greenhouses while limiting water losses from the cultivation system is the condensation of water vapor present in the greenhouse air which can be collected from the cover glasshouses are better suited to this purpose but it is also possible in plastic multi tunnel greenhouses if having enough slope and by installing adequate cladding material and gutters condensation run off is facilitated by forming a water film on the surface instead of drops the use of no drop plastic in combination with roof angles of 14 40 has good condensation behavior without dripping von zabeltitz 2011v however the importance of condensation recovery in open greenhouses is small in relation to crop water demand in mediterranean conditions in a study carried out in almeria spain the mean daily value of condensed water flux collected from the inner roof surface of a venlo type glasshouse throughout the second half of an autumn winter cucumber crop was less than 5 of the crop water demand granados et al 2011 the use of closed greenhouses would permit almost full recovery of transpiration and irrigation with excellent quality water as only the fraction of water retained in the plant should be replaced by external water which could come from rainfall there has been some experimental work about the use of these greenhouses in mediterranean conditions zaragoza et al 2007 however they have not been commercially adopted up to date because of their high cost and energy input requirement solar desalination systems have also been tested to obtain water of high quality from saline or brackish water von zabeltitz 2011v but require some land surface which is not always available reverse osmosis is currently the most widely used commercial system but originates a brine whose elimination is problematic at the farm level an alternative can be the use of a modified ion exchange technology originating a small volume of brine which can be evaporated at the farm or transported elsewhere thompson et al 2018 in this technology the ion exchange resin can be regenerated with specific chemicals producing a fertilizer as a final product so that the cost of the chemicals can be covered with the value of the produced fertilizer in arid coastal areas large plants for the desalination of seawater are being used brine is discharged into the sea after dilution to avoid environmental problems special attention must be paid to the energy use of the process to minimize the cost an important issue to be considered is the chemical composition of the desalinated seawater which could be not optimal for recirculation in some cases it has been observed that despite its low ec by 0 5 ds m 1 it contains concentrations of na and cl of 3 mm life deseacrop 2018 troublesome considering that the uptake concentration of these ions for long life tomato in mediterranean conditions is 3 mm at a concentration in the root environment of 30 mm magán et al 2005 boron is another ion to be considered as its concentration tends to be high in desalinated seawater so that a second process of separation must be applied however it has been observed in tomato that opportune strategies of ns discharge in semi cl systems see section 4 1 may help to face the detrimental effects of b accumulation in the presence of saline water carmassi et al 2013 disinfection of the recirculating solution is another important issue in cl systems because of its high cost especially for the most effective methods of ultraviolet radiation pasteurization ozonation or electrolysis to reduce costs most mediterranean farms with recirculating systems are using chemical hydrogen peroxide or biological slow sand filtration disinfection methods but their efficacy is only partial an alternative method with high disinfection efficiency is ultrafiltration whose cost can be reduced by reusing ultrafiltration membranes previously used in hospitals for dialysis https www nufiltration com a disadvantage of ultrafiltration is the requirement of pre filtering to avoid clogging and backwashing to clean the membranes which makes necessary to deal with the resulting backwash water to minimize the discharge of water during cleaning band filtration can be a solution as it does not produce backwash waste and can deal with that coming from the cleaning of ultrafiltration and disc filtration systems thompson et al 2018 4 management techniques for minimizing water and nutrient losses 4 1 strategies for nutrient solution supply and recirculation the objective of fertigation management in soilless growing systems is to establish a ns that enables reaching target nutrient concentrations in the root zone sonneveld and straver 1994 however in cls the composition of the ns is partially determined by the composition of the drainage which is not constant likewise the drainage to water mixing ratio is not constant these factors cause destabilization of recirculating ns to maintain stable composition of recirculating ns it is necessary to replenish exactly the nutrients and water absorbed by the crop the ion uptake concentrations of a crop depend mostly among other factors on the species environmental conditions and crop development stage consequently it is not simple to estimate nutrient concentrations in the ns with high precision for this reason frequent chemical analyses of the recirculating solution are recommended to adjust the ns in order to avoid nutrient excesses or deficiencies fig 1 this is one of the main factors limiting the application of simulation models at operational level see section 3 2 there are different strategies for drainage recycling the most typical way of preparing the ns in a closed system is to firstly mix the drainage with fresh water and then to add the fertilizers afterwards the addition of fertilizers is frequently carried out based on the ec of the final solution in order to maintain a stable applied ec savvas and manos 1999 developed a computer algorithm to perform replenishment and reuse of the drain ns in closed hydroponic systems on the basis of dispensing as nutrients and water as were needed to maintain the ec of the applied ns to achieve this in each irrigation application dilution ratios of the concentrated fertilizer solutions were automatically adjusted considering the volume and ec of the drain solution using a computer program based on this algorithm later savvas 2002 developed two alternative models enabling complete automation of individual nutrient replenishment in closed hydroponic systems able to automatically calculate and control the fertilizer input the first one was based on maintaining target macronutrient ratios in the ns the second one maintained the corresponding mean uptake ratios by proper combination of fertilizers and fresh water both models were capable of supplying nutrients at the desired ratios provided that the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 in the fresh water were not excessive besides na and cl other ions such as ca2 mg2 and so4 2 can accumulate in the solution depending on their presence in the fresh irrigation water fig 1 this means that an increasing proportion of the final ec is derived from these ions and the injection of fertilizers is progressively reduced and the concentration of some nutrients like p and k can decrease appreciably figs 1 and 2 to avoid negative effects on yield it is necessary to renovate the recirculating ns as soon as specified low p and k concentrations are reached i e semi cl the n concentration can also decrease but it is usually less problematic as ph control which is independent of ec control is commonly carried out with nitric acid additions providing supplemental amounts of n a reduction of the build up of ca2 mg2 and or so4 2 in the recirculating ns can be obtained by adapting the fertilizer recipe an alternative strategy to maintain the nutrient concentration stable in the recirculating solution is by quantitatively injecting fertilizers based on pre determined uptake concentrations of the crop this involves injecting pre set concentrations of stock solutions to the irrigation flow without considering the ec of the final solution in this case it will not be possible to ensure the stability of ec in the recirculating ns because of the possible accumulation of saline ions however ec of drainage can be measured to decide when to discharge another possibility is to combine drainage water and fresh water and then proportionally injecting fertilizers based on a pre determined ec value this procedure enables more stable ec but leads to a depletion of nutrients in the root zone however the nutrient concentration can be monitored to decide when to discharge n no3 concentration can be for example used as a nutrient guide parameter to recover suitable nutrient conditions massa et al 2010 compared both strategies by using non optimal quality water and observed that the preparation of the irrigation solution based on ec enabled a more stable ec in the recirculating solution in this case there were large but controlled decreases of no3 concentration which required frequent discharge of the recirculating ns on the contrary the mixing of full strength refill ns with drainage reduced the discharge frequency and maintained sufficient concentration of most nutrients in the recirculating solution however it caused an appreciable discharge of no3 these authors also tested a third strategy which was a combination of both but where only fresh water addition compensated for crop water uptake after a maximum ec value was reached this resulted in a lower discharge frequency and promoted a decrease of the no3 concentration which reduced the discharge frequency and no3 emissions yield was not affected magán et al 2017 observed that this strategy also provided good results when the limiting nutrient was k rather than n all the above strategies are graphically represented in fig 2 the effectiveness of such procedures strongly depends on crop tolerance to salinity and to nutrient deficits and fluctuations in the root zone raviv et al 2019 reported the response of different crops to recirculation with several different threshold ec values showed that management with large ec fluctuation reduced water and nutrient discharges compared to smaller ec fluctuation this was because smaller water volumes were required to dispose of a certain quantity of salts when the salt concentration was higher marhuenda 2008 described different approaches for practical recycling of the ns in commercial cls the simplest method of mixing drainage with fresh water consisted of partially refilling the recycling tank with fresh water to a level controlled by a buoy so that the concentrations of the ns to be recycled were reduced prior to the addition of fertilizers to correct nutrient concentration however this approach required periodic renovation of the recirculating ns to avoid excessive concentrations of undesirable ions another approach was to mix drainage and fresh water shortly before they entered the fertigation equipment by using a hydraulic or motorized control valve the solution was then subsequently adjusted to obtain the desired nutrient concentrations however a disadvantage of this approach is that the drainage to water mixing ratio depends on the ec of the reused leachate and cannot be automatically adapted consequently if the drainage fraction is higher than the mixing ratio in the recycling process a partial discharge of drainage solution may be necessary savvas 2002 therefore the process is highly dependent on the buffering capacities of the storage tank a third approach for recycling is to irrigate directly with drainage after controlling ph and mixing with fresh water if necessary to maintain the maximum ec that is acceptable for the crop when the ns in the recycling tank is consumed the irrigation continues by preparing new ns from fresh water and fertilizers when using non optimal quality water for recirculation climate control of the greenhouse is very important because it can reduce crop transpiration thereby decreasing freshwater use and salt accumulation in cl systems cohen et al 2003 observed this effect by increasing the relative humidity of air in the greenhouse although humidification requires the use of water it reduces the discharge of recirculating solution and the disposal of no3 transpiration can be also reduced by adding co2 which reduces stomatal opening and conductance idso et al 1984 shading is another effective technique but it must be carefully applied as it can reduce the yield of the crop by combining a high tech irrigation system with controlled microclimate and environmental management such as the use of closed semi closed greenhouses gruda et al 2019 with the capture and reuse of condensed evaporated water van kooten et al 2004 the use of light selective shading and evaporative cooling systems additional water savings are possible gruda and tanny 2015 however the use of systems for active climate control is currently limited in commercial mediterranean greenhouses where natural ventilation is frequently the only climate control technology available apart from simple shading techniques therefore the adoption of recirculation in the mediterranean region should be associated with improved climate control of the greenhouse 4 2 strategies for nutrient solution discharge the amounts of nutrients lost from a cultivation system depend on their concentration at fixed lf in ols or ns discharge frequency and quantity in semi cl systems however even in cl systems the residual ns may contain significant quantities of nutrients at the end of the cultivation cycle in fact nutrients in soilless cultivation are normally supplied with the irrigation water at concentrations much higher than those required by plants for optimal uptake for most nutrients the plant uptake rate increases more rapidly than increased concentration in the root zone the maximum absorption rate in many cases occurs at concentrations that are generally much lower than in the standard nutrient solution used in commercial soilless production massa et al 2019b sharifi and zebarth 2006 ter steege et al 1999 based on the above assumption vegetable crops can be grown at very low nutrient concentrations in the root zone if they are replaced at concentrations close to the actual uptake concentrations especially if the root zone nutrient buffering is high as observed in lcs massa et al 2019b this implies that short periods of nutrient depletion could not influence the yield and quality of soilless grown vegetables massa et al 2010 therefore some depletion techniques have been proposed to reduce the discharge of nutrients from soilless crops siddiqi et al 1998 imposed both severe reductions of macronutrient concentrations and the interruption of the replenishment of the feed solution for the 16 days of soilless grown tomato without affecting growth yield or quality other authors concluded that with the adoption of appropriate strategies the concentration of nutrients in feed solution can be reduced with negligible loss of yield especially in ol systems le bot et al 2001 massa et al 2010 proposed two different strategies for the discharge of ns from soilless tomato grown with saline water free of nutrients as previously described section 4 1 and fig 2 obtaining reductions of up to 95 of no3 loss at flushing the initial conditions can be possibly recovered by washing the substrate with additional fresh water however the pattern showed in fig 2 is theoretical because at each flushing the capacity to recover the initial conditions depends on washing efficiency mainly depending on fresh water chemical characteristics and washing volume in general the higher the need for recovering the initial conditions and or the level of salinity the higher is the volume of water leached fig 3 larger fluctuations in ec will allow appreciable savings of water in semi cls due to less frequent discharge of the ns fig 2 however an overall increase in the ec in the root zone will be inevitable in this case fig 3 4 3 reusing drainage water in cascade cropping systems when the ns cannot be further recirculated in the same cropping system for any reason it could be reused for growing plants with higher tolerance to the accumulated element s in a cascade cropping system ccs instead of being discharged and lost with the same criterion a depletion of potential pollutants e g no3 or phosphates can be obtained using in the ccs less and less exigent species at each step of water reuse the potential in terms of water and nutrient saving with reduced environmental impact is high for ccs in mediterranean soilless cultivations garcía caparrós et al 2018 incrocci et al 2003 proposed a sort of ccs to reduce the environmental impact of semi cl cultures by reusing drained ns from a hydroponic system to a second crop in this system a salt tolerant tomato cultivar cherry tomato was cultivated with salt enriched ns derived from ns recycled in a less tolerant cultivar round table tomato the drain water becomes progressively more saline as each successive species is grown and in the end it is drained out when the salinity is too high for profitable cultivation but the nutrient content is negligible thus safer from an environmental point of view garcía caparrós et al 2018 examined three water treatments in melons rosemary and cacti and revealed that the application of blended drainage water blended with water of low ec and sequentially reuse allowed to save significant amounts of water and nutrients in comparison with a standard ns treatment ccss can indeed involve hybrid soilless soil cropping systems and strategy in which nutrient and non nutrient elements can deplete or accumulate before discharge to another crop in a tomato crop grown on perlite a first step towards sustainability was a reduced level of applied n and a second step was the collection and reuse of leachates from this hydroponic system to another soil grown crop muñoz et al 2012 in that study the adoption of the ccs reduced environmental impact for the climate change category but increased the eutrophication category due to the reduced yield in soil grown crops compared with soilless the ns drained out from a scs tomato was used as an alternative source of fertilizer for the cultivation of cabbage grown on soil choi et al 2011 zhang et al 2006 reported similar results for the cultivation of soil grown muskmelon with increased soluble solids and weight of fruits than those obtained in hydroponic conditions one of the main issues with ccss is probably related to the heterogeneity of crops in the same farm that can be difficult to manage in highly specialized farming systems yet the cultivation of secondary crops could limit grower s incomings since less exigent species often correspond to less remunerative productions per cultivated unit area therefore the right choice of plant material including cultivar selection and the use of grafting see section 4 4 can be strategic for a profitable implementation of ccss 4 4 the role of substrates medium amendments and plant material the choice of growing media composition and cultivation system can be highly relevant for efficient water and nutrient management in soilless crops for example balanced air porosity and available water is an essential prerequisite for successful plant growth and development and then ns recirculation in soilless growing media such as aggregated perlite rockwool and coconut coir however valenzano et al 2008 reported lower wue in a substrate bag system rockwool compared with nft tomatoes grown in nft system or scs obtained higher yield in nft when compared to inert material such as perlite and pumice tzortzakis and economakis 2005 but revealed lower wue in nft 27 6 l kg 1 compared with pumice 30 7 l kg 1 tzortzakis and economakis 2008 the choice of the right substrate may preserve nutrient leaching as clough and gondron 2010 reported one of the beneficial impacts of biochar when used in soil or soilless media altland and locke 2012 dumroese et al 2011 evaluated pelletized biochar and they found that when 25 v v biochar was added in peat moss the hydraulic conductivity and water retention at high matric potentials improved biochar affects macronutrient dynamics in sphagnum peat based substrates preventing leaching of nh4 and no3 and enhancing k levels and availability for the crop altland and locke 2012 biochar application as an amendment supported the growing media with k and p and reflected the mineral accumulation in cabbage seedlings chrysargyris et al 2019 yet increasing rates of biochar in substrates increased k and ca in tomato plants prasad et al 2018 massa et al 2019a in contrast to biochar coir and pine bark have higher n leaching and lower water holding capacity when compared to peat and sometimes contain high total soluble salts and na and cl levels gruda et al 2013 some substrates like zeolite expanded clay tuff or biochar can improve cation exchange capacity in substrate mixtures so that na can be adsorbed on the substrate surface while releasing ca2 and mg2 thereby reducing the presence of the harmful ion in the recirculated solution jang et al 1996 added 10 g l 1 of artificial ca zeolite with a cation exchange capacity of 235 meq 100g 1 to a hydroponic system which would be helpful to limit na accumulation for several months under normal mediterranean growing conditions with moderate saline water raviv et al 1998 could recirculate for more than one year the ns in rose grown on tuff with non optimal quality water obtaining with very low ns discharge these results possibly exploitable in vegetable crops were attributed to the exchange capacity of the substrate organic substrates contain microorganisms compared to inorganic materials which hardly contain any tomato and strawberries grown in cocopeat coir and coconut fiber had higher vegetative growth compared with plants grown in perlite schwarz et al 2009 jerca et al 2015 moreover mixing organic with inorganic material resulted in higher tomato yields indicating the beneficial effects of organic material into the substrate tzortzakis and economakis 2008 which could be play a role for a more efficient nutrient uptake and use in single crops and ccss as well see section 4 3 species and cultivar selection also play a strategic role the success of brackish water use in hydroponic cultivation scheme depends on the selection of suitable plant species that can take up potential environmental pollutants i e plant nutrients used for biomass production through established agronomic practices in that sense haddad et al 2012 reported a removal efficiency of 91 and 47 of n and p respectively using a hydroponic system planted with different plant species based on their different nutrient and water demands on the other hand species and cultivars that are more tolerant to salinity or other toxic ions this may include different tolerance mechanisms will require lower lf and allow more prolonged recirculation of the ns in cl systems or reuse in ccss dde pascale et al 2019 incrocci et al 2003 to this purpose grafting has been found effective to overcome abiotic stresses since the root systems of selected rootstocks can absorb water and nutrients much more efficiently compared with ungrafted plants and limit the absorption of toxic ions or their translocation in the aboveground biomass colla et al 2006 lee et al 2010 grafted melons grown in pumice revealed higher fruit yield and quality in comparison with plants grown with their own roots under saline conditions colla et al 2006 colla et al 2010 observed that some grafting combinations of melon grown on perlite under ns recirculation were more efficient in no3 use compared with ungrafted plants in other studies the use of rootstock improved the tolerance to excess b in the irrigation water of tomato grown on perlite di gioia et al 2017 which is an example of micronutrient toxicity often occurring in soilless cultivation in the mediterranean area and that can limit water recirculation in cl systems carmassi et al 2013 5 final remarks and future perspectives in southern europe soilless cultivation occupies a small part of the cultivated surface area of greenhouse vegetable crop production however where used soilless cropping can provide high yields and product quality soilless crop production can lead the sector in the application of modern technologies which can appreciably increase the sustainability of vegetable production the possibility of monitoring with high precision water and nutrient streams in these cultivation systems is a key factor for limiting emissions to the environment soilless producers in southern europe encounter the pressure of increasingly restrictive regulation however rather being perceived only as a constraint these restrictions can be seen as an opportunity to produce high quality vegetables in an environmentally friendly manner consumers are increasingly sensitive to the combined concepts of healthy and sustainable which can be used as a formula for the marketing of soilless vegetable production the reduction of emissions not only means less environmental impact but also entails reduced inputs of limited resources particularly of water and nutrients the issue of optimizing water use in greenhouses in the mediterranean region is particularly important because climate change is expected to have a strong impact on the already limited fresh water supply soilless systems can involve the adoption of high level technologies and complex structures however ol soilless systems are generally preferred in southern europe for their simplicity of management theoretically zero drainage can be achieved in ol systems by the adoption of modern and sophisticated techniques and technologies however in practice a certain amount of leachate is usually required even when using high quality irrigation water this is to compensate for crop heterogeneity due to i differential plant growth ii changes in the substrate characteristics during the growing cycle and iii different microclimatic conditions within the greenhouse higher lf is required if poorer quality water is used for irrigation e g saline water the benchmark of knowledge here is the application of solutions that reduce heterogeneity of the cultivation systems by optimizing input supply efficient ns distribution and knowledge of crop requirements right choice of planting material and of crop monitoring the most promising technologies to limit the emissions in ol systems are those related to optimized irrigation control such as moisture sensors and other sensing technologies the cost of this equipment has decreased in recent years and many of the previous technical issues have been addressed however their capacity to provide representative information of actual growing conditions over the cropping zone and being sufficiently reliable for decision making remains issues that require attention sensor positioning and data processing are key issues other tools like simulation models are available to predict crop performance and to conduct scenario analysis in simulation studies however their practical application is scarce due to the lack of relevant accurate data for many cultivation systems and the time requirements for trained operators simple changes in irrigation practices as recycling drainage water can considerably improve the sustainability of low cost soilless greenhouses and to appreciably reduce the environmental footprint of the greenhouse industry however in southern europe the potential of cl systems and their variants i e semi cl systems is not well understood and is often overlooked in many greenhouse production areas of the mediterranean region the main difficulty limiting ns recirculation in soilless culture is related to the salinity of the irrigation water however widely held established ideas with no scientific basis the use of purely empirical management and some knowledge gaps contribute to the limited adoption of cl systems in soilless production in southern europe in particular there are scarce relevant and thorough economic studies for example there is a general opinion that the initial costs for cl are higher than ol but there is little information of long term cost benefit analysis the involvement of extension services is required to disseminate relevant technical information on soilless cropping and to support growers in its adoption none of the above solutions can be considered as being definitive for a substantial reduction of water and nutrient losses this will be achieved using an integrated approach based on a holistic point of view in this context it is useful to identify smart agronomic approaches related to i planting material which can improve crop performance and management strategies and to ii structural solutions and equipment which can facilitate the re use and recirculation of water and nutrients most of the previously mentioned techniques and technologies are already available and tested they can be integrated with each other to minimize water and nutrient losses to achieve high economic and environmental sustainability of soilless cropping in southern europe yet their level of adoption is often low because of two simple to identify but difficult to solve issues 1 training growers should be more supported by specific programs aimed at improving their knowledge and awareness of possible solutions to reduce emissions 2 cost the implementation of some innovations appears costly considering the possible economic return in terms of water and nutrient saving the large scale adoption of soilless cropping with recirculation may be enhanced directly or indirectly through regulation by financial assistance and by training programs declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest acknowledgements the authors would like to thank prof rodney thompson university of almeria for his revision and suggestions on the section final remarks and future perspectives 
10505,in agriculture soilless cropping represents the most suitable cultivation technique apt to achieve a theoretical 100 efficiency of water and nutrient use this is possible through a high control of input streams in the cultivation system soilless cultivation indeed allows high precision in nutrient and water management so that particular agronomic techniques which are risky in other cultivation systems e g nutrient depletion or the maintenance of low nutrient concentrations in the root zone can be managed more safely under soilless conditions even in the so called open free drain cycles water and nutrient losses can be minimized by the combination of sensing technologies and nutrient delivery strategies aiming at zero emissions however soilless cropping allows collection and reuse of the drainage in closed growing systems thereby avoiding or minimizing water and nutrient losses into the environment the main challenge when managing closed systems in southern europe conditions is usually the progressive salinization of the recirculating solution because of saline irrigation waters often available in many in coastal areas of the mediterranean the use of alternative water sources like rainwater or desalinated water can prevent this problem but their availability is limited advanced recirculation strategies have demonstrated a high potential for reusing the solution under saline conditions with optimal use and minimal discharge of nutrients hence there is currently enough knowledge to support a larger application of closed soilless systems in mediterranean conditions on the other hand proper choices in terms of cultivation facilities and structures and plant material can be relevant to achieve high water and nutrient use efficiency the main relevant techniques e g nutrient solution management strategies and right choice of planting material and technologies e g sensing technologies and greenhouse structures to minimize water and nutrient losses from soilless grown vegetable crops in southern europe are reviewed in this paper abbreviations cl closed loop ccs cascade cropping systems dft deep flow technique dss decision support

efficiency precision agriculture salinity vegetables 1 introduction soilless cropping is mostly not to say completely related to protected cultivation in southern europe although open air cultivation is also possible in this region under soilless conditions fruit bearing vegetables are mainly cultivated on substrates like coir perlite pumice and rockwool and irrigated by drip irrigation and only occasionally by subirrigation while leafy vegetables and herbs are preferably grown in floating systems or deep flow technique dft and secondarily in nutrient film technique nft while only occasionally in aeroponics although many growing systems have been tested in the past only the above mentioned were found suitable for commercial purposes however soilless culture includes a plethora of different cultivation systems and technical solutions nutrient and water management strategies and various technologies that can influence much the expectations in terms of emissions losses by nutrient solution discharge or leachate and water and nutrient use efficiencies wue and nue respectively this heterogeneity must be taken in consideration for the identification of strategies and solutions apt to minimize water and nutrient losses in soilless cropping in this review we will refer to the main categories of substrate culture soilless scs or liquid culture soilless lcs which also includes aeroponics while the term hydroponics will be used without further specifications however intending it as a subcategory of soilless systems in some cultivation environments the use of substrate in scs for fruit bearing vegetables production is preferred to lcs because the presence of a solid growing medium represents a buffer to prevent or limit possible water and nutrient stress other than temperature fluctuations in the root zone this former aspect is indeed highly relevant in southern europe where mediterranean climate causes high evapotranspiration et rate at canopy level especially in low tech greenhouses where natural or forced ventilation is often adopted for the control of high air temperature katsoulas and stanghellini 2019 for the same reason dft is preferred among other lcs systems since it shows a buffering water and nutrient capacity comparable even with soil cultivation in southern europe spain italy france and greece are the major producers of vegetables under protected cultivation in spain the highest area of soilless vegetable production is in the plain of almería 32 000 ha covered with parral type and multi tunnel polyethylene greenhouses out of 60 000 ha for the entire country where the total surface occupied by these soilless systems is estimated at 3 000 ha while other greenhouse areas are of minor importance in terms of surface devoted to soilless incrocci et al 2020 in the year 2000 soilless production in almería was carried out mostly using perlite 52 and rockwool 45 substrates while natural fibers were of minor importance conversely in more recent years the percentage of substrate based on coconut fibers increased up to 32 to the detriment of rockwool garcía garcía et al 2016 valera et al 2016 in italian commercial greenhouses soilless production accounts for 9 of roughly 33 000 ha incrocci et al 2020 nicoletto et al 2018 tomato crops mostly transplanted on mineral perlite or organic coconut fibers substrates and fertigated through drip irrigation ranks first among very few other fruit vegetables most of the production is managed by free drain irrigation control with high 20 30 leaching fraction lf to avoid salt accumulation in the root zone due to the presence of saline ions that often abound in coastal areas pardossi et al 2006 in greece 300 ha cyprus 40 ha and in mediterranean france 330 ha soilless vegetables mainly cultivated in scs and sometimes in lcs are of minor importance over a total protected cultivated area of 7 300 ha incrocci et al 2020 the majority 80 is managed by free drain systems except in france where the use of closed system has increased significantly in recent years most greenhouses are multi tunnel soft plastic polyethylene and single multispan structures and very few are covered with glass or polycarbonate in greece and cyprus rockwool and coconut fibers are the main substrates followed by perlite and pumice and used under growth bags or handmade soilless culture structures the main vegetable crops are tomato cucumber followed by eggplant lettuce strawberry and peppers froutonea 2012 tzortzakis 2014 in some countries of southern europe especially spain soilless cropping reached the highest popularity during the 1980 and 1990 decades followed by a drastic decrease garcía garcía et al 2016 there are some explanations for this decrease such as the extended adoption of grafting which resolves problems related to root diseases the competition with organic production systems which have to be done in soil and increasing regulations on substrate disposal however the phenomenon is complex and behind practical issues there are also many other cultural and educational reasons nonetheless intensive systems such as soilless cropping merit high attention in southern europe as there are many excellent brands producing under soilless conditions their potential is huge in terms of sustainability and under the perspective of circular horticulture and their adoption is seen as a solution to partially face the food requirements of the next generations sambo et al 2019 soilless culture can indeed boost intensive cropping systems with impressive wue and nue and very high product yield and quality high efficiency can be achieved in scs through the adoption of closed loop cl systems where the nutrient solution ns drained from the root zone is collected and reused alternatively in open free drain loop ol systems that drainage is not recycled and lost thereby causing a waste of water and nutrients some of the drained nutrients especially no3 and phosphates and some micronutrients may become a threat for the environment and a concern for human and animal health if accumulated in excess in the ecosystem it must also be underlined that the ns may contain variable concentrations of plant protection products eventually discharged into the environment with the drainage water vermeulen et al 2017 however the option of cl is only occasionally adopted in soilless systems for vegetable production in the mediterranean area for example in the plain of almeria only roughly 12 of soilless production is devoted to the ns recirculation valera et al 2016 along with environmental concerns and the possible impact that water and nutrient losses may have on production costs there are also many other issues to be faced by soilless growers for example those related to marketing and legislations or climate changes that can drastically influence produce yield and quality in low tech mediterranean greenhouse cultivations the exigency of producing high quality vegetables with environmentally friendly approaches is nowadays more perceived as a priority by consumers that may strongly influence the market by their choices therefore what can appear as a constrain could turn into an opportunity for the sector for example it has been observed that the consumers of vegetables are more incline to associate the idea of healthy and sustainable productions than in other agri food sectors verain et al 2016 although they are in general not available to pay extra money for product environmental sustainability beside strengths and opportunities in this work we highlight the main bottlenecks of soilless production and reviewed the most suitable and promising techniques and technologies that reduce water and nutrient losses from soilless cropping in southern europe 2 key points to minimize water and nutrient losses from soilless cropping crops growing in substrate are commonly irrigated with excess ns to avoid nutrient and water deficits while limiting excess salt accumulation sonneveld and voogt 2009 in mediterranean vegetable production it is generally accepted that up to 20 30 of the irrigation water 30 40 of absorbed water can be lost in drip irrigated systems or even more if poor quality water is available for irrigation pardossi et al 2006 along with this phenomenon a large waste of water and nutrients and higher production costs inevitably occurs in ol culture thus decreasing both the environmental and economical sustainability of soilless cropping for example considering a water uptake of 400 500 l m 2 for a 9 month tomato crop in unheated greenhouse variability depending on cultivars and geographic area up to 120 200 l m 2 of water would be lost in free drain systems with a parallel loss of 170 335 34 95 165 435 kg ha 1 of n p and k respectively i e for n p k concentration of 10 12 0 9 1 5 4 5 7 mmol l 1 in the ns depending on cultivar therefore when ols are adopted for irrigation in scs the most two important key factors are the correct irrigation schedule and ns composition in fact in fertigated cropping systems water and nutrient supplies are mutual and can influence each other in terms of excesses or deficits and thus use efficiency a precise control of irrigation is therefore strategic to limit water and nutrient losses from soilless cropping such a goal can be achieved with high precision nowadays by the adoption of tools to estimate crop water and nutrient uptake through i sensing technologies see section 3 1 and or ii simulation and prediction tools see section 3 2 incrocci et al 2017 however the absolute quantity of nutrient lost with the drainage water also depends on the concentration of salts dissolved in the ns when fertilizers salts are provided at concentrations higher than the actual crop uptake concentration the ratio between the quantity of any ion depleted in the root zone and the volume of water evapotranspirated in the same time unit sonneveld and voogt 2009 an accumulation of solutes will inevitably occurs in the root zone this causes an increase in electrical conductivity ec that in turn can be reduced by increasing lf in a never ending loop or by reducing the ec of the supplied ns therefore providing nutrients concentrations equal to the actual ion uptake concentrations means having a system in a steady state condition although many techniques and technologies are now available to achieve the theoretical zero emissions the key word yet remains optimization since some emissions are physiological necessary under operational conditions it must be underlined that under an acceptable range some extra supply of water and nutrients is in the practice functional to overcome problems related to crop heterogeneity in terms of equipment functionality and crop physiological needs in fact some extra lf is strategic to compensate for uneven ns distribution due to possible dripper and substrate inefficiency or crop water and nutrient uptake due to microclimatic differences in the greenhouse in this regard much research has been developed in northern european countries since the 1980 s however in southern europe higher et rates are correlated with lower values of actual nutrient uptake concentration compared with colder climates where crop et is much lower in closed greenhouses incrocci et al 2017 katsoulas and stanghellini 2019 for example n uptake concentrations in soilless tomato have been reported as much lower in spain and italy massa et al 2010 thompson et al 2013 compared with the netherlands voogt 1993 a further aspect to be considered is the natural presence of nutrients in growing media that possibly may support plant nutrition at least partially barrett et al 2016 massa et al 2019a this extra nutrient budget should be considered for the correct computation of an equilibrated nutrient balance to avoid plant nutrient imbalances and optimize nutrient inputs and outputs in the growing system closed loop systems provide the best performing solution to deal with the issue of water and nutrient losses in soilless cropping thus ensuring a low impact on environment and production costs see sections 3 3 4 1 and 4 2 the main difficulty in recirculating water in southern europe is due to the presence of saline ions e g na and cl which are often present in the irrigation water at concentrations higher than the actual crop uptake concentration thereby increasing ec as they accumulate in the recirculating ns although the benefits of recycling water in an irrigation system are strongly dependent on water quality it has been demonstrated that also when saline water is available for irrigation e g in presence of salt tolerant vegetables like tomato the adoption of semi cls where the ns is discharged only partially during the cultivation cycle to recover suitable cultivation conditions see section 4 1 may be a successful alternative massa et al 2010 montesano et al 2010 a further strategic factor for limiting water and nutrient losses in soilless cropping lies in the correct choice of substrate and containers and the selection of appropriate species and cultivars or rootstock as a function of their tolerance or resistance to abiotic stresses i e salinity presence of toxic ions and other substances that would require high lf fraction in sensitive crops see section 4 4 for example it has been demonstrated that the addition of some organic and inorganic materials in the substrate like compost biochar or zeolite can alleviate the detrimental effects of excess salinity in the irrigation water used for substrate grown vegetables barret et al 2016 3 management technologies for minimizing water and nutrient losses 3 1 sensing technologies for crop monitoring and automation sensing technologies can be adopted to gather data from multiple sources the subsequent analysis of collected data is functional to drive decisions and or automate the management of the cultivation process these technologies are fully included in the concepts of smart and precision agriculture recently recognized as a tremendous opportunity for improving soilless cultivation sambo et al 2019 several experiences recently performed in southern europe report the feasibility of such an approach with interesting achievements in terms of water and fertilizer use optimization in soilless cultivation table 1 for example zamora izquierdo et al 2019 developed and tested in a commercial tomato greenhouse in southeastern spain a smart farming low cost iot internet of things platform specifically designed for soilless culture reporting savings of 30 in water consumption and up to 80 in some fertilizers compared with ol system there are different approaches to use sensor data for the management of irrigation and nutrient supply the simplest method is to turn irrigation on and off based on whether a target sensed parameter is below or above a user defined set point e g substrate moisture level and ec or plant stress parameters other approaches which are discussed elsewhere in this paper see section 3 2 are based on the modeling of crop water or nutrient requirement as a function of environmental conditions monitored through sensors or specific crop parameters therefore basic technologies to monitor common environmental parameters like for example air temperature will be not considered in this section since ol or semi cl systems are largely adopted in southern european soilless cultivation avoiding leaching beyond what is strictly necessary can significantly reduce environmental impact accurate monitoring of leachate solution parameters in particular ns volume ec and ionic composition through appropriate sensing technologies can help to reduce leaching rates to the bare minimum a large use of automatic irrigation scheduling based on lf control has been reported for greenhouses in southeastern spain where several studies were conducted focusing on a fertigation control tray system urrestarazu 2013 this method consists in the adoption of a tray on which cultivation units most commonly grow bags or rockwool slabs are placed equipped with a drainage tank an electrical signal triggers irrigation based on the level of the drainage in the tank an evolution of this system in which the measurements of leachate volumes are analyzed by a proportional integral derivative pid algorithm has been recently introduced and successfully tested on soilless tomato rodríguez et al 2017 these authors concluded that the positive performance and the low cost of such equipment for irrigation control would result in significant cost savings if implemented at commercial scale the application of an interesting irrigation management strategy based on the use of the fertigation control tray method combined with a leaching solution ec based irrigation scheduling adjusted daily to obtain a proper lf as a function of a pre set ec has been reported on perlite grown cucumber in spain sánchez guerrero et al 2009 monitoring the weight of the container plant substrate system through appropriate equipment provides a real time estimation of substrate water content variations due to et a weighing gutter system was developed and successfully used for improved irrigation management of soilless tomato and cucumber de graaf et al 2004d real time monitoring of water status and other substrate parameters in the root zone is considered one of the most promising and feasible approaches for precision irrigation and nutrient supply control in greenhouse soilless production pardossi et al 2009 van iersel et al 2013v this is due to the current availability of reliable and relatively low cost sensors and technologies supporting the implementation of wireless sensor actuator networks making objective decisions and automating irrigation based on root zone water status sensing relies on a simple principle the water content in the substrate decreases because of et sensors can detect this change and irrigation is automatically activated through actuator devices when a predetermined set point value is reached resulting in on demand irrigation this approach complies with the assumption that optimal irrigation management should supply water and fertilizers in the case of fertigated crops just when the plants require it the determination of correct irrigation set points is a key factor to support optimal crop performance and improved use of water resources and it should be based on specific information regarding the effects of substrate water availability on plants moreover it must be considered that the matric potentials in real cultivation conditions could vary from those determined from the moisture retention curves obtained in laboratory conditions due at least partially to the typical hysteresis of substrate moisture curves naasz et al 2005 in practice for irrigation management moisture retention curves available for most of commercially used substrates can be used to define proper irrigation set points however a certain amount of water exceeding the actual crop evapotranspiration is needed to ensure watering uniformity in this regard sensing matric potential through tensiometers can be adopted for automatic irrigation control in soilless conditions the use of tensiometers was combined with closed cycle subirrigation with low concentration ns to optimize water use efficiency and avoid ns discharge into the environment compared with traditional ol drip in both soilless tomato montesano et al 2010 and green bean bouchaaba et al 2015 tensiometer based automatic irrigation control was also used to impose specific irrigation set points corresponding to different substrate water availability conditions enhancing some tomato fruit quality traits montesano et al 2015 a novel dielectric tensiometer specifically designed for use in substrates with an operational range of 0 7 to 2 5 kpa matric potential integrated with a precision pid based irrigation controller was successfully tested on a cultivation of soilless strawberry grown on coir allowing precise matching of water delivery to plant needs goodchild et al 2018 main drawbacks of tensiometer use are related to the need of a careful positioning to ensure good contact between the porous tip and the substrate and of frequent maintenance pardossi et al 2009 at the moment a great interest is directed towards dielectric sensors for the measurement of soilless substrate volumetric water content vwc nemali et al 2007 dielectric sensors combining the measurement of multiple substrate parameters vwc ec and temperature are now available at reasonable prices for these instruments calibration equations for many of the most used substrates can be found in the literature along with related practical indications on how to manage the effects of changes in physical properties of soilless substrates due to different mix ratios or root system growth on the sensor reading quality rhie and kim 2017 kang et al 2019 using vwc sensors combined with the adoption of proper irrigation set points corresponding to optimal substrate water availability conditions proved to be a successful approach for optimal fertigation management of important soilless grown vegetable crops significant water savings increased wue and almost no leaching was obtained with moisture sensor based compared with timer based irrigation in ol soilless lettuce montesano et al 2016 automatic irrigation based on substrate vwc and ec sensing was used on coir grown tomato resulting in automatic adjustment of irrigation scheduling matching fluctuations of plant water needs as a result of climatic condition variations over the growing cycle and better control of leaching compared to a timer based schedule choi et al 2013 an innovative cloud connected system for wireless sensor based smart irrigation management was used on basil grown in a perlite coco substrate under mediterranean greenhouse conditions allowing for a reduction in leaching to values considered a goal for efficient irrigation management in ol soilless culture i e 10 to 15 montesano et al 2018 for the above sensors spatial heterogeneity in crop water demand and limited number of sensors as typically occurs in commercial greenhouse conditions have been posed as an issue in principle observations on spatial variability in crop transpiration can be used to develop sophisticated and precise irrigation control systems potentially able to lead to more uniform conditions for the plants however to fully exploit spatial measurements through highly dense sensor networks the actuators would need to be developed in such a distributed and advanced way to ensure the same punctual distribution ferentinos et al 2017 it has been documented how the variations in microclimate inside greenhouses may cause corresponding variations in the water content of soilless substrate profiles the water content value to be used as set point for irrigation and the number of sensors needed in a greenhouse should be evaluated based on the greenhouse conditions the crop species and the growing medium as a rule of thumb large microclimate variation within the greenhouse or narrower range of acceptable growing substrate vwc imply that more sensors are needed further research is indeed required to provide more evidences on optimal irrigation set points for different crops and on the number of soil moisture sensors needed within a greenhouse of a given size and magnitude of microclimate variation henderson et al 2018 plant sensing real time monitoring of specific physiological parameters or processes aimed to early detection of plant stress conditions has long been proposed as a possible approach for irrigation scheduling or as a feed back control strategy in high frequency on demand irrigation systems jones 2004 however due to several disadvantages of this approach e g inability to indicate how much water to apply relatively high equipment cost altered sensitivity due to improper sensor installation automated sensing systems still in a development stage plant sensing based fertigation management is still mostly confined to research applications on the other hand taking advantage of new technological advancements in the implementation of wireless sensor networks a combination of sensing technologies for plant and environment based parameters now seems to be a promising strategy for efficient automatic irrigation scheduling an automation system for water and n deﬁcit detection based on hyperspectral machine vision technologies for determination of spectral indices was recently tested in a soilless tomato crop revealing promising results for developing control strategies for sustainable greenhouse production elvanidi et al 2018 similarly katsoulas et al 2019 used spectral data transformed into vegetation indexes to detect salinity stress in soilless tomato outlining the potential of these sensing technologies for optimal fertigation management other plant sensing techniques and technologies to monitor plant n status have been specifically reviewed by padilla et al 2020 the availability of sensing technologies able to assist growers in the control of ns parameters is a critical aspect in most cases ph and ec of the recirculating ns and of the drainage are the only parameters monitored by hand meters or in case of greenhouse operations equipped with more advanced technologies with on line sensors to collect data on crop nutrient status electrical conductivity is generally used to operate also automatically adjustments of the recirculating ns and or of the leaching rate through modifications of irrigation scheduling in this context much interest is currently devoted to ion selective electrodes as a possible tool for online monitoring of the solutions many studies have been conducted although some impairments to a broader promotion and use of these sensors still exist currently portable analyzers are generally used to measure on site the concentrations of individual ions although scarce availability of sensors for some elements represents a limitation technical problems are still related to the accuracy of nutrient concentration determination strongly affected by signal drift reduced sensitivity over time inappropriate calibration sampling procedures and probes maintenance sambo et al 2019 interesting studies have been recently conducted to solve some technical problems and successful tests aimed to incorporate real time ion concentration measurement in soilless cultivation procedures are reported that open new perspectives for future implementation of these tools cho et al 2018 domingues et al 2012 rius ruiz et al 2014 3 2 simulation models and decision support systems as an alternative to direct measurements through sensing technologies water and nutrient requirements and eventually emissions can be estimated from simulation tools based on modelling approaches in soilless systems simulation models to estimate crop water and ion uptake and dynamics in the root zone can then be applied for making decisions in terms of nutrient and water management in soilless crops incrocci et al 2017 pardossi et al 2006 sambo et al 2019 output data can be used differently depending on user s needs and type and scope of simulations running simulations for on time management will mainly have the aim of supporting growers during the cultivation cycle for making decisions over short periods 3 5 days to one week or following the crop day by day this kind of information may consist of i estimation of the correct lf to maintain suitable conditions in the root zone while minimizing nutrient and water waste in ol systems ii forecasting dates to discharge the ns e g in semi cl which are also essential for planning the application of plant protection products vermeulen et al 2017 iii adjustment of the ns concentration and irrigation scheduling model based predictions for off line analyses might instead provide information for making decisions over longer periods such simulations may provide many outputs like water and nutrient non nutrient uptake and leaching concentration of nutrient non nutrient and ec in the root zone for different scenarios simulated basing on historical data or environmental condition forecasting this can be helpful for example to make decisions on proper crop selection structural investments equipment choices and strategies to face possible constraints that will limit the economic and environmental sustainability of soilless cropping considering irrigation as the main vector for plant nutrition in fertigated crops simulation models for water requirements have frequently been proposed for the optimized management of mediterranean soilless crops many of these models are based on simplified versions of the penman monteith equation katsoulas and stanghellini 2019 and have been proposed for several vegetable crops under mediterranean soilless conditions like cucumber medrano et al 2005 pepper ahn and son 2019 and tomato carmassi et al 2007 martínez ruiz et al 2019 massa et al 2011 battista et al 2017 proposed a modified version of the tomgro model whose outputs were used to simulate the water uptake of three different tomato cultivars through the baille s equation katsoulas and stanghellini 2019 a detailed description of the main simulation equations for the estimation of et adapted to greenhouse cultivation is reported in incrocci et al 2020 yet probabilistic approaches based on a dynamic bayesian network to simulate plant growth and et of leafy vegetables have recently been proposed for lettuce grown hydroponically kocian et al 2020 however under saline growing conditions often occurring in coastal cultivated areas of southern europe crop water uptake may vary as a function of the root zone salinity levels dde pascale et al 2019 as already mentioned saline water for irrigation is a common problem in southern europe that forces the use of higher lf in soilless crops see section 2 which affects plant nutrition and physiology dde pascale et al 2019 therefore the prediction of saline ion accumulation and crop absorption is essential to avoid excess water and nutrient runoff carmassi et al 2005 proposed a model to simulate salinity build up due to na accumulation in the root zone and ec level for the optimization of partial discharge of the ns when the salinity level surpasses a pre established set point in successive studies the same authors proposed a regression model to simulate crop evapotranspiration of tomato grown on rockwool in a mediterranean greenhouse carmassi et al 2007 in these studies a linear relationship between na uptake concentration and the concentration of the same ion in the recirculating ns was found using the same approach savvas et al 2005 found non linear exponential relationships to simulate na and cl accumulation and their influence on water uptake in soilless grown cucumber sodium and cl uptake concentration as previously defined see section 2 were considered as the guide parameters to simulate their accumulation in different soilless grown vegetables such as tomato katsoulas et al 2015 massa et al 2011 pepper savvas et al 2008 melon neocleous and savvas 2016 and zucchini neocleous and savvas 2017 for effective simulations specie specific parameterizations are often required for example katsoulas et al 2015 highlighted the need for different model calibrations with different tomato cultivars in the case of na simulations however the same authors concluded that the proposed model was helpful in minimizing nutrient and water discharge in semi cl systems in comparison with ols alternatively more mechanistic approaches have been considered to simulate na and cl absorption and accumulation in the root zone of soilless crops silberbush and ben asher 2001 silberbush et al 2005 apart from the influence that saline ions may have on crop et and other plant physiological aspects at the operational level the importance of their dynamics in the root zone lies in the contribution of these ions to overall ec however ec variation in the root zone is the result of nutrient and non nutrient composition fig 1 and thus to have a more complete picture for optimized nutrient management the simulation of all elements should be accomplished ahn and son 2019 massa et al 2011 savvas and gruda 2018 models based on the concept of ionic uptake concentration have largely been proposed also to simulate concentration variations in the root zone and uptake of nutrient ions in several vegetable crops kläring et al 1999 massa et al 2011 savvas 2002 other simple regression models have been parameterized to simulate nutrient absorption in soilless grown vegetable crops under mediterranean conditions pardossi et al 2004 2006 other authors proposed more mechanistic approaches to simulate the absorption of essential nutrients in soilless grown vegetables anastasiou et al 2005 the michaelis menten s equation and modified versions was suggested as a reference model to simulate the plant intake of different nutrient ions as a function of their external concentration mathieu et al 1999 such equations have been calibrated for several crops like pepper ahn and son 2019 tomato bar yosef et al 2004 silberbush and ben asher 2001 and lettuce silberbush et al 2005 wheeler et al 1998 grown in soilless systems many of the above models had as final aim the simulation of ec variations in the root zone because it represents a guide parameter for the operational management of the ns savvas and gruda 2018 raviv et al 2019 urrestarazu and garcía 2000 for example experiments with pepper grown in a cl system showed how the application of simulation models which simulate ec in the recirculating ns can be successfully applied to limit nutrient waste and for a better more stable control of ec in the root zone ahn and son 2019 other approaches to simulate nutrient uptake or ion concentration in the root zone of soilless grown plants were based on plant nutrient demand driven by growth combined with nutrient concentration in plant tissues le bot et al 1998 mathieu et al 1999 empirical parameters like the ion uptake concentration may indeed vary as a function of environmental conditions phenological phases and species and even cultivars but as matter of fact are strictly linked to fertigation practice since are representative of the actual concentration of nutrients to be maintained in the ns however ion and water uptake are basically uncoupled phenomena therefore modelling nutrient uptake as a function of water flux would be not soundly correct from a physiological point of view le bot et al 1998 to this end some authors simulated plant nutrient and water uptake as a function of plant growth to finally obtain a dynamic nutrient uptake concentration martínez ruiz et al 2019 probabilistic models based on complex nonlinear data collection have also been adopted to simulate nutrient concentration in cl soilless culture lstm long short term memory algorithms were for example used as a deep learning approach for the simulation of the daily variation of nutrient concentration in the root zone of soilless pepper moon et al 2019 different equations and algorithms developed with specific targets or for the simulation of single variables can be integrated into more complete tools or decision support systems dsss for water and nutrient simulation the dss hortimed was developed for optimal management of fertilizer injection of soilless crops grown under mediterranean conditions with special attention paid towards saline growing environments recommendations provided by the software included operational management to limit crop environmental impact and production costs anastasiou et al 2005 massa et al 2011 proposed a dss to simulate nutrient and non nutrient variations in the root zone for the estimation of water and nutrient use and runoff of ol cl and semi cl systems managed with different strategies to face common problems arising from the use of saline water in soilless cropping under mediterranean conditions this work provided the basis for the development of the more complex dss hydrotools incrocci et al 2012 https www wur nl en research results projects and programmes euphoros calculation tools hydrotools htm composed of a module solnutri for the preparation of stock nss and the upgraded version of the software simulhydro incrocci et al 2008 the proposed dss can operate for on time management or off line scenario analyses among other outputs the dss calculates when the recycling ns must be replaced in semi cl systems to optimize ns discharge yet the dss can be run to compare different fertigation strategies system layouts water qualities or crop species with diverse nutrient requirements salinity tolerance or affinity to the ballast ions contained in the irrigation water similar scenario analyses can be carried out using the dss proposed by ferentinos et al 2003 as a tool for optimal water management in soilless culture under saline conditions a further example is the dss hortsyst which combines n uptake simulated as a function of plant growth and nutrient concentration with crop et for the dynamic calculation of n uptake concentration in soilless tomato crops martínez ruiz et al 2019 simulation components are however not the only prerogative of dsss for soilless culture dsss may also involve different tools and integrate different techniques and technologies for the optimized water and nutrient management of soilless crops varying from simulation to sensing tools see section 3 1 applied for different purposes and with different management strategies incrocci et al 2017 for example a web based application system for improved irrigation scheduling of soilless crops based on an algorithm using data from a sensor network in the greenhouse was tested in commercial farms in greece resulting in 100 increases of wue and nue katsoulas et al 2017 goumopoulos et al 2014 designed an adaptable dss integrated with a wireless sensor actuator network to implement autonomous cl zone specific irrigation decisions were made based on both plant and environmental conditions and a machine learning module was also included the application of the system on a soilless strawberry cultivation resulted in significant water saving and wue increase compared with irrigation based on empirical user s experiences the integration of simulation tools with actual measurements in the so called corrective approaches for nutrient management has been reported to be effective in vegetable crop fertigation incrocci et al 2017 thompson et al 2018 following this strategy soilless management based on simulations or fixed protocols prescriptive approaches can be corrected during the cultivation through a periodical reset with real world data such as actual water or nutrient uptake or actual composition of the recycling ns although the potential of simulation models and dss has been largely documented in theory and assessed in many experimental trials in practice there is a lack of comparative works where soilless crops are completely managed with the sole support of dss and automations of soilless equipment completely based on dss outputs the implementation level of these tools in soilless cultivation of southern europe could indeed be improved 3 3 facilities and structural solutions for efficient water and nutrient recirculation in lcs systems roots develop directly in the ns which has to be supplied continuously or intermittently with a high frequency to prevent water stress so that recirculation of the solution is compulsory in order to avoid a huge waste of water and fertilizers savvas and gruda 2018 scs systems instead require spaced irrigation events depending on crop demand and the water retention of the substrate these are conceptually open systems since the substrate acts as a reservoir of water and air for the roots and irrigation can be adjusted to minimize leaching but they have been converted into closed systems by placing the containers or slabs with substrate on gutters for drainage collection and installing tanks for its accumulation a disinfection system as a security measure and an injection and mixing system for the incorporation of the drainage to the ns hence an additional investment is necessary in this case for recirculation in spain for example it has been reported a cost of 72 000 ha 1 as first investment and 800 ha 1 per year for the maintenance of closed system facilities life drainuse 2019 as yield is limited by non optimal climatic conditions inside the passive climate greenhouses typical of the mediterranean area the repercussion of the additional investment per unit of production is significantly higher than in the high tech greenhouses typical of other latitudes the selection of materials and components necessary for recirculation has to be done very carefully in order to minimize and amortize the investment by saving water and nutrients as previously discussed cl systems have to face the issue of salinity build up in the recirculating ns that could be partially mitigated by using an adequate growing system subirrigation watering method promotes the upwards movement of water in the substrate due to capillarity while concentrating salts in the upper layer this can promote slower salinization of the recirculating solution in comparison with conventional drip irrigation and lower runoff requirements with an increase in wue and nue incrocci et al 2006 furthermore as the solution is usually soaked into the pot pathogens are not able to move in the reverse direction and contaminate the circulating solution which reduces the risk of spreading pathogens molitor 1990 interesting applications of subirrigation have been reported in mediterranean conditions for different crops bouchaaba et al 2015 incrocci et al 2006 montesano et al 2010 2015 rouphael and colla 2009 although sometimes lower productions were reported due to excess salt accumulation in the substrate martinetti et al 2008 on the other hand the accumulation of salts in the substrate can restrict its life span a split root growing system could be also used to promote high accumulation of salts in a part of the root environment while maintaining low salinity in the other part without affecting yield sonneveld and voogt 1990 a splitting scheme of nutrient supply to plants via fertigation as an effective way to prevent increased salinity levels resulted in 25 nutrient savings compared with a conventional fertigation system alvarenga et al 2013 fernandes et al 2007 although this system would need further development before using it commercially it could increase wue and nue when using low quality water by reducing emissions rainwater is an excellent source of water for recirculation and can be easily recovered from greenhouses unfortunately rainfall in the mediterranean basin is not frequent enough to completely satisfy crop water requirements and it is unevenly distributed during the year not optimally meeting the water demand pattern of a crop this makes necessary to build ponds big enough for rainwater recovery which are costly and occupies space so that an extensive use of rainfall is not always feasible especially in areas with high greenhouse concentration optimal dimensioning of the storage capacity can be currently achieved by using models based on long term data sets of climatological parameters and datasets or models for crop water uptake thompson et al 2018 a disadvantage of rainwater use for irrigation is the possible dispersion in the crop of spores of pathogenic fungi like phytium spp which are present in the dust accumulated on greenhouse covers sánchez et al 2001 to reduce this risk different disinfection systems can be used however the development in the pond of certain aquatic macrophytes can be promoted as an environmentally friendly and low cost method having an inhibitory effect on bacterial density and phytium propagule viability juan et al 2014 additionally aquatic plants can make a satisfactory control of phytoplankton in the water bonachela et al 2013 another source of high quality water to boost cls in mediterranean greenhouses while limiting water losses from the cultivation system is the condensation of water vapor present in the greenhouse air which can be collected from the cover glasshouses are better suited to this purpose but it is also possible in plastic multi tunnel greenhouses if having enough slope and by installing adequate cladding material and gutters condensation run off is facilitated by forming a water film on the surface instead of drops the use of no drop plastic in combination with roof angles of 14 40 has good condensation behavior without dripping von zabeltitz 2011v however the importance of condensation recovery in open greenhouses is small in relation to crop water demand in mediterranean conditions in a study carried out in almeria spain the mean daily value of condensed water flux collected from the inner roof surface of a venlo type glasshouse throughout the second half of an autumn winter cucumber crop was less than 5 of the crop water demand granados et al 2011 the use of closed greenhouses would permit almost full recovery of transpiration and irrigation with excellent quality water as only the fraction of water retained in the plant should be replaced by external water which could come from rainfall there has been some experimental work about the use of these greenhouses in mediterranean conditions zaragoza et al 2007 however they have not been commercially adopted up to date because of their high cost and energy input requirement solar desalination systems have also been tested to obtain water of high quality from saline or brackish water von zabeltitz 2011v but require some land surface which is not always available reverse osmosis is currently the most widely used commercial system but originates a brine whose elimination is problematic at the farm level an alternative can be the use of a modified ion exchange technology originating a small volume of brine which can be evaporated at the farm or transported elsewhere thompson et al 2018 in this technology the ion exchange resin can be regenerated with specific chemicals producing a fertilizer as a final product so that the cost of the chemicals can be covered with the value of the produced fertilizer in arid coastal areas large plants for the desalination of seawater are being used brine is discharged into the sea after dilution to avoid environmental problems special attention must be paid to the energy use of the process to minimize the cost an important issue to be considered is the chemical composition of the desalinated seawater which could be not optimal for recirculation in some cases it has been observed that despite its low ec by 0 5 ds m 1 it contains concentrations of na and cl of 3 mm life deseacrop 2018 troublesome considering that the uptake concentration of these ions for long life tomato in mediterranean conditions is 3 mm at a concentration in the root environment of 30 mm magán et al 2005 boron is another ion to be considered as its concentration tends to be high in desalinated seawater so that a second process of separation must be applied however it has been observed in tomato that opportune strategies of ns discharge in semi cl systems see section 4 1 may help to face the detrimental effects of b accumulation in the presence of saline water carmassi et al 2013 disinfection of the recirculating solution is another important issue in cl systems because of its high cost especially for the most effective methods of ultraviolet radiation pasteurization ozonation or electrolysis to reduce costs most mediterranean farms with recirculating systems are using chemical hydrogen peroxide or biological slow sand filtration disinfection methods but their efficacy is only partial an alternative method with high disinfection efficiency is ultrafiltration whose cost can be reduced by reusing ultrafiltration membranes previously used in hospitals for dialysis https www nufiltration com a disadvantage of ultrafiltration is the requirement of pre filtering to avoid clogging and backwashing to clean the membranes which makes necessary to deal with the resulting backwash water to minimize the discharge of water during cleaning band filtration can be a solution as it does not produce backwash waste and can deal with that coming from the cleaning of ultrafiltration and disc filtration systems thompson et al 2018 4 management techniques for minimizing water and nutrient losses 4 1 strategies for nutrient solution supply and recirculation the objective of fertigation management in soilless growing systems is to establish a ns that enables reaching target nutrient concentrations in the root zone sonneveld and straver 1994 however in cls the composition of the ns is partially determined by the composition of the drainage which is not constant likewise the drainage to water mixing ratio is not constant these factors cause destabilization of recirculating ns to maintain stable composition of recirculating ns it is necessary to replenish exactly the nutrients and water absorbed by the crop the ion uptake concentrations of a crop depend mostly among other factors on the species environmental conditions and crop development stage consequently it is not simple to estimate nutrient concentrations in the ns with high precision for this reason frequent chemical analyses of the recirculating solution are recommended to adjust the ns in order to avoid nutrient excesses or deficiencies fig 1 this is one of the main factors limiting the application of simulation models at operational level see section 3 2 there are different strategies for drainage recycling the most typical way of preparing the ns in a closed system is to firstly mix the drainage with fresh water and then to add the fertilizers afterwards the addition of fertilizers is frequently carried out based on the ec of the final solution in order to maintain a stable applied ec savvas and manos 1999 developed a computer algorithm to perform replenishment and reuse of the drain ns in closed hydroponic systems on the basis of dispensing as nutrients and water as were needed to maintain the ec of the applied ns to achieve this in each irrigation application dilution ratios of the concentrated fertilizer solutions were automatically adjusted considering the volume and ec of the drain solution using a computer program based on this algorithm later savvas 2002 developed two alternative models enabling complete automation of individual nutrient replenishment in closed hydroponic systems able to automatically calculate and control the fertilizer input the first one was based on maintaining target macronutrient ratios in the ns the second one maintained the corresponding mean uptake ratios by proper combination of fertilizers and fresh water both models were capable of supplying nutrients at the desired ratios provided that the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and so4 2 in the fresh water were not excessive besides na and cl other ions such as ca2 mg2 and so4 2 can accumulate in the solution depending on their presence in the fresh irrigation water fig 1 this means that an increasing proportion of the final ec is derived from these ions and the injection of fertilizers is progressively reduced and the concentration of some nutrients like p and k can decrease appreciably figs 1 and 2 to avoid negative effects on yield it is necessary to renovate the recirculating ns as soon as specified low p and k concentrations are reached i e semi cl the n concentration can also decrease but it is usually less problematic as ph control which is independent of ec control is commonly carried out with nitric acid additions providing supplemental amounts of n a reduction of the build up of ca2 mg2 and or so4 2 in the recirculating ns can be obtained by adapting the fertilizer recipe an alternative strategy to maintain the nutrient concentration stable in the recirculating solution is by quantitatively injecting fertilizers based on pre determined uptake concentrations of the crop this involves injecting pre set concentrations of stock solutions to the irrigation flow without considering the ec of the final solution in this case it will not be possible to ensure the stability of ec in the recirculating ns because of the possible accumulation of saline ions however ec of drainage can be measured to decide when to discharge another possibility is to combine drainage water and fresh water and then proportionally injecting fertilizers based on a pre determined ec value this procedure enables more stable ec but leads to a depletion of nutrients in the root zone however the nutrient concentration can be monitored to decide when to discharge n no3 concentration can be for example used as a nutrient guide parameter to recover suitable nutrient conditions massa et al 2010 compared both strategies by using non optimal quality water and observed that the preparation of the irrigation solution based on ec enabled a more stable ec in the recirculating solution in this case there were large but controlled decreases of no3 concentration which required frequent discharge of the recirculating ns on the contrary the mixing of full strength refill ns with drainage reduced the discharge frequency and maintained sufficient concentration of most nutrients in the recirculating solution however it caused an appreciable discharge of no3 these authors also tested a third strategy which was a combination of both but where only fresh water addition compensated for crop water uptake after a maximum ec value was reached this resulted in a lower discharge frequency and promoted a decrease of the no3 concentration which reduced the discharge frequency and no3 emissions yield was not affected magán et al 2017 observed that this strategy also provided good results when the limiting nutrient was k rather than n all the above strategies are graphically represented in fig 2 the effectiveness of such procedures strongly depends on crop tolerance to salinity and to nutrient deficits and fluctuations in the root zone raviv et al 2019 reported the response of different crops to recirculation with several different threshold ec values showed that management with large ec fluctuation reduced water and nutrient discharges compared to smaller ec fluctuation this was because smaller water volumes were required to dispose of a certain quantity of salts when the salt concentration was higher marhuenda 2008 described different approaches for practical recycling of the ns in commercial cls the simplest method of mixing drainage with fresh water consisted of partially refilling the recycling tank with fresh water to a level controlled by a buoy so that the concentrations of the ns to be recycled were reduced prior to the addition of fertilizers to correct nutrient concentration however this approach required periodic renovation of the recirculating ns to avoid excessive concentrations of undesirable ions another approach was to mix drainage and fresh water shortly before they entered the fertigation equipment by using a hydraulic or motorized control valve the solution was then subsequently adjusted to obtain the desired nutrient concentrations however a disadvantage of this approach is that the drainage to water mixing ratio depends on the ec of the reused leachate and cannot be automatically adapted consequently if the drainage fraction is higher than the mixing ratio in the recycling process a partial discharge of drainage solution may be necessary savvas 2002 therefore the process is highly dependent on the buffering capacities of the storage tank a third approach for recycling is to irrigate directly with drainage after controlling ph and mixing with fresh water if necessary to maintain the maximum ec that is acceptable for the crop when the ns in the recycling tank is consumed the irrigation continues by preparing new ns from fresh water and fertilizers when using non optimal quality water for recirculation climate control of the greenhouse is very important because it can reduce crop transpiration thereby decreasing freshwater use and salt accumulation in cl systems cohen et al 2003 observed this effect by increasing the relative humidity of air in the greenhouse although humidification requires the use of water it reduces the discharge of recirculating solution and the disposal of no3 transpiration can be also reduced by adding co2 which reduces stomatal opening and conductance idso et al 1984 shading is another effective technique but it must be carefully applied as it can reduce the yield of the crop by combining a high tech irrigation system with controlled microclimate and environmental management such as the use of closed semi closed greenhouses gruda et al 2019 with the capture and reuse of condensed evaporated water van kooten et al 2004 the use of light selective shading and evaporative cooling systems additional water savings are possible gruda and tanny 2015 however the use of systems for active climate control is currently limited in commercial mediterranean greenhouses where natural ventilation is frequently the only climate control technology available apart from simple shading techniques therefore the adoption of recirculation in the mediterranean region should be associated with improved climate control of the greenhouse 4 2 strategies for nutrient solution discharge the amounts of nutrients lost from a cultivation system depend on their concentration at fixed lf in ols or ns discharge frequency and quantity in semi cl systems however even in cl systems the residual ns may contain significant quantities of nutrients at the end of the cultivation cycle in fact nutrients in soilless cultivation are normally supplied with the irrigation water at concentrations much higher than those required by plants for optimal uptake for most nutrients the plant uptake rate increases more rapidly than increased concentration in the root zone the maximum absorption rate in many cases occurs at concentrations that are generally much lower than in the standard nutrient solution used in commercial soilless production massa et al 2019b sharifi and zebarth 2006 ter steege et al 1999 based on the above assumption vegetable crops can be grown at very low nutrient concentrations in the root zone if they are replaced at concentrations close to the actual uptake concentrations especially if the root zone nutrient buffering is high as observed in lcs massa et al 2019b this implies that short periods of nutrient depletion could not influence the yield and quality of soilless grown vegetables massa et al 2010 therefore some depletion techniques have been proposed to reduce the discharge of nutrients from soilless crops siddiqi et al 1998 imposed both severe reductions of macronutrient concentrations and the interruption of the replenishment of the feed solution for the 16 days of soilless grown tomato without affecting growth yield or quality other authors concluded that with the adoption of appropriate strategies the concentration of nutrients in feed solution can be reduced with negligible loss of yield especially in ol systems le bot et al 2001 massa et al 2010 proposed two different strategies for the discharge of ns from soilless tomato grown with saline water free of nutrients as previously described section 4 1 and fig 2 obtaining reductions of up to 95 of no3 loss at flushing the initial conditions can be possibly recovered by washing the substrate with additional fresh water however the pattern showed in fig 2 is theoretical because at each flushing the capacity to recover the initial conditions depends on washing efficiency mainly depending on fresh water chemical characteristics and washing volume in general the higher the need for recovering the initial conditions and or the level of salinity the higher is the volume of water leached fig 3 larger fluctuations in ec will allow appreciable savings of water in semi cls due to less frequent discharge of the ns fig 2 however an overall increase in the ec in the root zone will be inevitable in this case fig 3 4 3 reusing drainage water in cascade cropping systems when the ns cannot be further recirculated in the same cropping system for any reason it could be reused for growing plants with higher tolerance to the accumulated element s in a cascade cropping system ccs instead of being discharged and lost with the same criterion a depletion of potential pollutants e g no3 or phosphates can be obtained using in the ccs less and less exigent species at each step of water reuse the potential in terms of water and nutrient saving with reduced environmental impact is high for ccs in mediterranean soilless cultivations garcía caparrós et al 2018 incrocci et al 2003 proposed a sort of ccs to reduce the environmental impact of semi cl cultures by reusing drained ns from a hydroponic system to a second crop in this system a salt tolerant tomato cultivar cherry tomato was cultivated with salt enriched ns derived from ns recycled in a less tolerant cultivar round table tomato the drain water becomes progressively more saline as each successive species is grown and in the end it is drained out when the salinity is too high for profitable cultivation but the nutrient content is negligible thus safer from an environmental point of view garcía caparrós et al 2018 examined three water treatments in melons rosemary and cacti and revealed that the application of blended drainage water blended with water of low ec and sequentially reuse allowed to save significant amounts of water and nutrients in comparison with a standard ns treatment ccss can indeed involve hybrid soilless soil cropping systems and strategy in which nutrient and non nutrient elements can deplete or accumulate before discharge to another crop in a tomato crop grown on perlite a first step towards sustainability was a reduced level of applied n and a second step was the collection and reuse of leachates from this hydroponic system to another soil grown crop muñoz et al 2012 in that study the adoption of the ccs reduced environmental impact for the climate change category but increased the eutrophication category due to the reduced yield in soil grown crops compared with soilless the ns drained out from a scs tomato was used as an alternative source of fertilizer for the cultivation of cabbage grown on soil choi et al 2011 zhang et al 2006 reported similar results for the cultivation of soil grown muskmelon with increased soluble solids and weight of fruits than those obtained in hydroponic conditions one of the main issues with ccss is probably related to the heterogeneity of crops in the same farm that can be difficult to manage in highly specialized farming systems yet the cultivation of secondary crops could limit grower s incomings since less exigent species often correspond to less remunerative productions per cultivated unit area therefore the right choice of plant material including cultivar selection and the use of grafting see section 4 4 can be strategic for a profitable implementation of ccss 4 4 the role of substrates medium amendments and plant material the choice of growing media composition and cultivation system can be highly relevant for efficient water and nutrient management in soilless crops for example balanced air porosity and available water is an essential prerequisite for successful plant growth and development and then ns recirculation in soilless growing media such as aggregated perlite rockwool and coconut coir however valenzano et al 2008 reported lower wue in a substrate bag system rockwool compared with nft tomatoes grown in nft system or scs obtained higher yield in nft when compared to inert material such as perlite and pumice tzortzakis and economakis 2005 but revealed lower wue in nft 27 6 l kg 1 compared with pumice 30 7 l kg 1 tzortzakis and economakis 2008 the choice of the right substrate may preserve nutrient leaching as clough and gondron 2010 reported one of the beneficial impacts of biochar when used in soil or soilless media altland and locke 2012 dumroese et al 2011 evaluated pelletized biochar and they found that when 25 v v biochar was added in peat moss the hydraulic conductivity and water retention at high matric potentials improved biochar affects macronutrient dynamics in sphagnum peat based substrates preventing leaching of nh4 and no3 and enhancing k levels and availability for the crop altland and locke 2012 biochar application as an amendment supported the growing media with k and p and reflected the mineral accumulation in cabbage seedlings chrysargyris et al 2019 yet increasing rates of biochar in substrates increased k and ca in tomato plants prasad et al 2018 massa et al 2019a in contrast to biochar coir and pine bark have higher n leaching and lower water holding capacity when compared to peat and sometimes contain high total soluble salts and na and cl levels gruda et al 2013 some substrates like zeolite expanded clay tuff or biochar can improve cation exchange capacity in substrate mixtures so that na can be adsorbed on the substrate surface while releasing ca2 and mg2 thereby reducing the presence of the harmful ion in the recirculated solution jang et al 1996 added 10 g l 1 of artificial ca zeolite with a cation exchange capacity of 235 meq 100g 1 to a hydroponic system which would be helpful to limit na accumulation for several months under normal mediterranean growing conditions with moderate saline water raviv et al 1998 could recirculate for more than one year the ns in rose grown on tuff with non optimal quality water obtaining with very low ns discharge these results possibly exploitable in vegetable crops were attributed to the exchange capacity of the substrate organic substrates contain microorganisms compared to inorganic materials which hardly contain any tomato and strawberries grown in cocopeat coir and coconut fiber had higher vegetative growth compared with plants grown in perlite schwarz et al 2009 jerca et al 2015 moreover mixing organic with inorganic material resulted in higher tomato yields indicating the beneficial effects of organic material into the substrate tzortzakis and economakis 2008 which could be play a role for a more efficient nutrient uptake and use in single crops and ccss as well see section 4 3 species and cultivar selection also play a strategic role the success of brackish water use in hydroponic cultivation scheme depends on the selection of suitable plant species that can take up potential environmental pollutants i e plant nutrients used for biomass production through established agronomic practices in that sense haddad et al 2012 reported a removal efficiency of 91 and 47 of n and p respectively using a hydroponic system planted with different plant species based on their different nutrient and water demands on the other hand species and cultivars that are more tolerant to salinity or other toxic ions this may include different tolerance mechanisms will require lower lf and allow more prolonged recirculation of the ns in cl systems or reuse in ccss dde pascale et al 2019 incrocci et al 2003 to this purpose grafting has been found effective to overcome abiotic stresses since the root systems of selected rootstocks can absorb water and nutrients much more efficiently compared with ungrafted plants and limit the absorption of toxic ions or their translocation in the aboveground biomass colla et al 2006 lee et al 2010 grafted melons grown in pumice revealed higher fruit yield and quality in comparison with plants grown with their own roots under saline conditions colla et al 2006 colla et al 2010 observed that some grafting combinations of melon grown on perlite under ns recirculation were more efficient in no3 use compared with ungrafted plants in other studies the use of rootstock improved the tolerance to excess b in the irrigation water of tomato grown on perlite di gioia et al 2017 which is an example of micronutrient toxicity often occurring in soilless cultivation in the mediterranean area and that can limit water recirculation in cl systems carmassi et al 2013 5 final remarks and future perspectives in southern europe soilless cultivation occupies a small part of the cultivated surface area of greenhouse vegetable crop production however where used soilless cropping can provide high yields and product quality soilless crop production can lead the sector in the application of modern technologies which can appreciably increase the sustainability of vegetable production the possibility of monitoring with high precision water and nutrient streams in these cultivation systems is a key factor for limiting emissions to the environment soilless producers in southern europe encounter the pressure of increasingly restrictive regulation however rather being perceived only as a constraint these restrictions can be seen as an opportunity to produce high quality vegetables in an environmentally friendly manner consumers are increasingly sensitive to the combined concepts of healthy and sustainable which can be used as a formula for the marketing of soilless vegetable production the reduction of emissions not only means less environmental impact but also entails reduced inputs of limited resources particularly of water and nutrients the issue of optimizing water use in greenhouses in the mediterranean region is particularly important because climate change is expected to have a strong impact on the already limited fresh water supply soilless systems can involve the adoption of high level technologies and complex structures however ol soilless systems are generally preferred in southern europe for their simplicity of management theoretically zero drainage can be achieved in ol systems by the adoption of modern and sophisticated techniques and technologies however in practice a certain amount of leachate is usually required even when using high quality irrigation water this is to compensate for crop heterogeneity due to i differential plant growth ii changes in the substrate characteristics during the growing cycle and iii different microclimatic conditions within the greenhouse higher lf is required if poorer quality water is used for irrigation e g saline water the benchmark of knowledge here is the application of solutions that reduce heterogeneity of the cultivation systems by optimizing input supply efficient ns distribution and knowledge of crop requirements right choice of planting material and of crop monitoring the most promising technologies to limit the emissions in ol systems are those related to optimized irrigation control such as moisture sensors and other sensing technologies the cost of this equipment has decreased in recent years and many of the previous technical issues have been addressed however their capacity to provide representative information of actual growing conditions over the cropping zone and being sufficiently reliable for decision making remains issues that require attention sensor positioning and data processing are key issues other tools like simulation models are available to predict crop performance and to conduct scenario analysis in simulation studies however their practical application is scarce due to the lack of relevant accurate data for many cultivation systems and the time requirements for trained operators simple changes in irrigation practices as recycling drainage water can considerably improve the sustainability of low cost soilless greenhouses and to appreciably reduce the environmental footprint of the greenhouse industry however in southern europe the potential of cl systems and their variants i e semi cl systems is not well understood and is often overlooked in many greenhouse production areas of the mediterranean region the main difficulty limiting ns recirculation in soilless culture is related to the salinity of the irrigation water however widely held established ideas with no scientific basis the use of purely empirical management and some knowledge gaps contribute to the limited adoption of cl systems in soilless production in southern europe in particular there are scarce relevant and thorough economic studies for example there is a general opinion that the initial costs for cl are higher than ol but there is little information of long term cost benefit analysis the involvement of extension services is required to disseminate relevant technical information on soilless cropping and to support growers in its adoption none of the above solutions can be considered as being definitive for a substantial reduction of water and nutrient losses this will be achieved using an integrated approach based on a holistic point of view in this context it is useful to identify smart agronomic approaches related to i planting material which can improve crop performance and management strategies and to ii structural solutions and equipment which can facilitate the re use and recirculation of water and nutrients most of the previously mentioned techniques and technologies are already available and tested they can be integrated with each other to minimize water and nutrient losses to achieve high economic and environmental sustainability of soilless cropping in southern europe yet their level of adoption is often low because of two simple to identify but difficult to solve issues 1 training growers should be more supported by specific programs aimed at improving their knowledge and awareness of possible solutions to reduce emissions 2 cost the implementation of some innovations appears costly considering the possible economic return in terms of water and nutrient saving the large scale adoption of soilless cropping with recirculation may be enhanced directly or indirectly through regulation by financial assistance and by training programs declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest acknowledgements the authors would like to thank prof rodney thompson university of almeria for his revision and suggestions on the section final remarks and future perspectives 
10506,participatory irrigation management pim has been broadly promoted by public administrators and donor organizations the reasons for this push include performance failures of state controlled irrigation schemes and the need to improve irrigation productivity for meeting rising food demands a popular reform for increasing participation and ownership is represented by irrigation management transfers imts imts mean replacing the government with the civil society farmers in irrigation management and they go beyond working with the public sector as in pim these widely implemented reforms produced mixed experiences besides the evaluation of imt cases is reliant on scarce quantitative data imts are also difficult to replicate due to methodological issues however qualitative research can engage with stakeholders perceptions and narratives especially the most relevant target group namely farmers we provide in this study stakeholders opinions and attitudes towards several waves of imt reforms in the gezira scheme in sudan this mega scheme is of high developmental and socio cultural importance for the country ever since the independence from the british empire using a perception survey and in depth interviews with key informants we illustrate the failure legacies to reform the gezira scheme by enhancing farmers participation through water user associations wuas while both farmers and experts have suggested a poor implementation inadequate farmers involvement and unclear objectives of the reforms the reforms recurrent failures are explained within complex historic and political contexts there are long standing legacies of development missteps of the gezira scheme with no clear and ultimate triggers of performance deterioration besides splits in professional cultures power imbalances political instrumentalization of farmers and the lack of farmers awareness or capacities are salient factors for understanding the poor state of the gezira scheme it is difficult for stand alone irrigation management reforms to be successful such reforms need to be embedded within a comprehensive policy package that prioritizes irrigation governance and proposes sound regulations based on clear roles consensus making and prior consultation keywords irrigation management transfer farmers perceptions gezira irrigation scheme sudan 1 introduction irrigation is seen as a solution to meet rising food demands across the world about 20 of cultivated land under irrigation produce 40 of the global food output unesco 2009 with irrigation crop yields per hectare and profitability are estimated to be higher than in rain fed agriculture darré et al 2019 garces restrepo et al 2007 lobell et al 2009 vico and porporato 2011 irrigation is found to contribute to poverty alleviation as it makes food more available and affordable for the poor due to higher productivity and lower risk of crop failure hussain and hanjra 2004 the development of irrigation schemes was greatly expanded after the second world war as governmental and international donor investments peaked in the 1970s according to seibert et al 2013 on a global level more than 300 million hectares are today equipped for irrigation 69 in asia 17 in america 8 in europe 4 in africa 2 in oceania with the majority 62 irrigated with surface water by consuming a 70 share of all freshwater withdrawn globally and up to 95 in developing countries agriculture is the largest water use sector seibert et al 2013 almost half of irrigated agriculture is practiced in only three countries china india and pakistan fao 2011 other areas of high irrigation density can be found in the us and along the nile river in egypt and sudan while food demand will increase by 50 globally by 2050 and 100 in developing countries today s agricultural demand for water resources is largely unsustainable due to the depletion of aquifers reduction of river flows degradation of ecosystems and the salinization of irrigated soil wwap 2015 in order to secure a world free from hunger and malnutrition agriculture needs to become more sustainable and resources use more efficient unwanted side effects of irrigation such as environmental damage and soil erosion need to be minimized at the same time extensive investment in irrigation infrastructure as seen around the world in the second half of the 20th century has proved to be insufficient in fact governments and international donors realized that there are serious management problems that inhibit the realization of irrigation schemes full potential in response management reforms were promoted in the guise of irrigation management transfers imts imt implies transferring the irrigation responsibility and authority from the public hands into civil societal actors such as the water user associations wuas or into private sector entities garces restrepo et al 2007 senanayake et al 2015 if irrigation management reforms involve merely working with and not replacing the government the term participatory irrigation management pim is used vermillion and sagardoy 1999 this irrigation subsector reform imt was heralded e g by donors as a recipe to reduce or even eliminate government expenditure for the operation and maintenance of irrigation infrastructure improve scheme efficiency and productivity as well as increase the income of farmers cambaza et al 2020 playán et al 2018 in the second half of the 20th century it has been promoted in tens of countries but with mixed results garces restrepo et al 2007 given the urgency to improve irrigated agriculture understanding if and how imt can live up to the expectations is highly important irrigation management is a key factor for water use efficiency and agricultural productivity alongside other factors such as infrastructure operation and maintenance o m land and water resources or cropping practices wwap 2015 there have been numerous case studies that evaluated the impact of imts on irrigation and water use performance these studies include relatively successful imt cases from india mishra et al 2011 mexico rap and wester 2013 and korea choi et al 2016 other cases reported imt failures on substantial issues such as irrigation scheme performance maintenance of infrastructure institutional set up of wuas or the collection of fees while the reasons and reform missteps vary across case study imt difficulties are reported from across the developing world e g in pakistan bell et al 2013 wegerich and hussain 2016 central asia yakubov 2012 india bassi and kumar 2011 indonesia suhardiman 2013 or ghana kakuta 2019 the impact direction of imts has also not been consistent for example in turkey irrigation associations improved collection of fees but not water use efficiency kibaroglu 2020 in central asian countries such as uzbekistan and kazakhstan imt implementation was not consequent in the different periods after the collapse of the soviet union while the involvement of state remained high zinzani 2016 2015 in fact fifty years after imt became a global trend evidence based research and the literature on post reform scheme performance are largely quantitative using performance key indicators kpis and less through qualitative analysis via farmers perceptions this poses several methodological difficulties to isolate and measure the impact of imt on scheme performance and shortcomings regarding the representativeness of the analyses senanayake et al 2015 there is little focus on farmers opinions and the perception of involved stakeholders which can vary greatly from one case to another senanayake et al 2015 in fact farmers as the irrigation water users are at the center of any imt process especially when responsibility is handed over to wuas thus it is important to understand their perceptions motivation capacity and needs furthermore the motivation behind imts is not studied thoroughly since the reduction of government expenditures is often cited as the main objective for introducing such reforms merrey et al 2007 vermillion 1997 the relevance of studying stakeholders perception of imt is arguably high due to their key role in imt implementation or more specifically the role of farmers in wuas the gezira scheme received a lot of attention from researchers and international organizations there are several studies on the development of the scheme and possible reasons for its poor performance al zayed et al 2016 2015 elshaikh et al 2018 plusquellec 1990 salman 2010 wallach 1988 world bank 2000 yet these studies have not yet gauged farmers and stakeholders opinions and attitudes towards several waves of imt and institutional reforms the objective of this study is to make a contribution to the wider discussion concerning if and how irrigation management transfer can lead to better irrigation management and ultimately greater food security environmental sustainability and poverty reduction this paper represents a reform outlook study that stresses the importance of soft issues such as addressing developmental legacies involvement of farmers the management of reform expectations awareness raising or good irrigation governance more specifically it looks at the perceptions of farmer groups and on site stakeholders of imt with the aim of exploring their understanding and lived experiences of the management reforms the paper also contextualizes irrigation management reforms of the gezira scheme within historic eras of state involvement in irrigation management in sudan and within international experiences of imt as such the study does not evaluate the success of the reforms the failure of the reforms is widely accepted as evident in the pullback of reforms package besides the paper does not evaluate gezira s scheme performance and the impact of imt as it is quite difficult to satisfactorily link imt reforms to the performance deterioration of the scheme although such detailed efforts exist e g elshaikh et al 2018 2 case study gezira irrigation scheme 2 1 gezira s key characteristics and reform timeline with a net command area of approximately 2 1 million feddan which corresponds to 882 000 ha the gezira scheme is one of the world s largest probably the largest irrigation scheme under one management it is located on the blue nile where the nile water is stored by the sennar dam and supplied to the field through an extensive network of canals consisting of two main canals 194 km major canals 2300 km minor canals 8000 km that feed tertiary canals locally called abu xx and then field ditches abu vi the plain fields are evenly and slightly sloped towards the northeast and allow for gravity irrigation fig 1 provides the key characteristics of the scheme the scheme was inaugurated with the construction of the sennar dam by the british in 1925 the initial objective was cotton production for britain s textile industry the scheme reached today s size with the managil extension through the construction of the roseiries dam in the early 1960s beyond the canalization network the scheme s infrastructure includes machinery equipment staff housing roads and vehicles the value of the infrastructure is roughly estimated to amount to eight billion usd and is an important asset of the government while around 12 000 farming families and thousands of state administrators usually live there eldaw 2004 during the first years after independence in 1956 cotton remained the main crop for export and sorghum the second as a stable food crop for the tenants in the mid 1970s agriculture was intensified and diversified by adding groundnuts vegetables and wheat impressive numbers materialized such as the gezira scheme representing less than 11 of sudan s cultivated area yet producing 60 of cotton 75 of wheat 35 of groundnuts verhoeven 2015 nation wide large scale irrigation was promoted and peaked at the end of the 1970s the price for the expansion of the area under irrigation was a reduction in agricultural efficiency in the gezira scheme the intensification and expansion have produced an impressive output in the short term but it contributed to the deterioration of the system in the long term this trend was reflected in the titles of early publications about the scheme arthur gaitskell s book from 1959 was called gezira a story of development in sudan not even twenty years later anthony barrett 1977 published the gezira scheme an illusion of development 2 2 overview of management change and reforms the gezira scheme has a unique land tenure arrangement after the establishment of the scheme the government either bought land or forced private owners to lease the land to the government for 40 years the basically dispossessed landowners became tenants land allotments were limited to the size of 15 30 feddan feddan equals around 0 4 ha after the expiration of the 1927 land ordinance no new system was arranged which still causes problems today ever since the management of the gezira scheme has been highly centralized in the hands of the sudan gezira board sgb the sgb determined the crop rotation plan including fallow period and was responsible for land management including levelling necessary to allow gravity flow which has been neglected since 1970s due to lack of resources and water management from minor to field canal the upper system was managed by the ministry of water and irrigation administratively the scheme was divided into 18 groups composed of five to seven blocks 114 in total headed by a block inspector the blocks were divided into a unit called number nimra 90 feddan which consisted of up to 18 hawashas farm tenant plot hussein et al 2002 in modern day sudan the gezira scheme witnessed different phases of relative prosperity after independence till the 1970s decline due to intensification increased water use and silt accumulation after the construction of the mangail extension in 1966 since the late 1970s liberalization during the 1990s and institutional reforms since early 2000s fig 1 provides a short historic trajectory the economic liberalization of the 1990s did not lead to the desired effect of increasing agricultural productivity based on a new incentive structure for farmers the government disengaged from the scheme but the private sector did not fill the gaps the scheme continued to deteriorate at an alarming rate in order to illustrate the major performance problems of the gezira scheme we summarize in the infographics in fig 2 key performance categories of the scheme and introduce selected performance indicators using data from secondary literature according to a 2000 world bank report the gezira scheme had become the least efficient schemes in world and needed to be institutionally reorganized salman 2010 mostly based on the world bank s recommendation the gezira scheme act was issued in 2005 and more than 1500 wuas one for each minor canal were established in 2007 this act represented the imt in the gezira scheme according to this act farm irrigation and management including collection of fees and weed cleaning were now the responsibilities of the wuas through the control of the minor canals and field canals the reform transferred the responsibility of field irrigation from the government to the farmers in the gezira scheme irrigation water reaches the field via the main canal major canals minor canals and eventually the field canals through gated field outlets pipes fops the field canals abu xx irrigate 90 feddan through 9 small field ditches abu vi which means that that one abu vi irrigates 10 feddan before 2005 block inspectors from the sgb were responsible for the minor canals and engineers from the ministry of water for the outlets from the major canals the 2005 gezira act replaced the 1984 act adopted after the last great rehabilitation project in 1983 and the 1927 gezira land ordinance which had forced private landowners to lease their land to the government however already in 2009 the ministry of agriculture and forestry admitted in a report that these reforms has been a total failure since the disposition of scheme s assets the crop choice freedom and the establishment of wuas lacking needed capacities have resulted in irrecoverable damage to the scheme salman 2010 table 1 provides a mapping of stakeholders as well as their roles and interests before and after the gezira act in the years after the 2005 reforms the performance of the gezira scheme did not pick up which led to the 2014 gezira act amendment this amendment replaced the wuas with agricultural cooperatives farmer unions while the scheme s maintenance and management of the irrigation including water allocation was transferred to the ministry of agriculture and irrigation the government was to finance the scheme through water charges and to appoint a scheme s governor by the republic s president instead of the elected general manager of the scheme here the ministry of water resources was not mentioned in the reform since in 2011 irrigation was moved to the ministry of agriculture from the ministry of water while electricity was given to the ministry of water resources and electricity in the same year in 2015 water management was given back to the now called ministry of water resources irrigation and electricity transferred from the now called the ministry of agriculture and forestry the reforms of 2014 met a strong opposition from farmers since it increased the role of the governor and pushed farmers into producers associations according to a university of khartoum professor this decision was made because the government is betting on the weakness of the financial administrative and logistical capabilities of the associations and their failure in the end to be given to the affiliates of the national congress party cited in radio dabanga 2015a in september 2015 the farmer unions known as wuas prior to the 2014 reforms were dissolved through the constitutional decree 32 which effectively meant a solidification of responsibilities for water management of the scheme under the ministry of water resources irrigation and energy while decision making systems and the organizational structure of the scheme become unresolved hydraulic research center 2016 3 method and data in order to gauge the perception of the stakeholders on the different episodes of the imt reforms in the gezira scheme this study largely relies on qualitative data using key informants interviews a farmers survey and a mapping of stakeholders and their declared attitudes ten expert interviews semi structured were conducted with the leadership and a staff from the gezira board 2 the ministry of water resources irrigation and electricity 1 the hydraulics research center 4 the agricultural research center 1 and independent experts 2 these are mostly stakeholders located in the gezira scheme area and work almost exclusively on this scheme these experts have been identified during a first visit to the study area in december 2015 the final number and selection of experts was a result of their availability and willingness to contribute to this study during a second field visit in march 2016 interview protocols served as documentation the experts did not necessarily represent the organizations they are working for but rather their personal perception further since the paper is primarily concerned with farmers involvement and their perception of the irrigation management reform a structured survey with multiple choice and open ended questions was conducted in 2016 the survey aimed at gathering information on farmers experience and perception of changes in operational maintenance economic and managerial performance of the scheme before and after 2005 particularly the survey assesses qualitative variables such as farmers knowledge and level of trust regarding the initiated reforms the survey borrows from iwmi methodology to assess imts samad and vermillion 1999 out of the total 50 interviewed farmers 15 were interviewed over phone in order in to get voices from other areas of the vast gezira scheme and not only from around wad medani farmers were sampled based on recommendations from local research institutions on representative farmers villages to visit based on prior research experiences several small groups of farmers were instructed about the survey and asked to fill in the survey individually they were supervised by a helper from a research institution in wad madni sudan who addressed farmers questions the translated survey can be found in annex 1 4 results 4 1 stakeholders perception on gezira s past performance and reforms 4 1 1 technical issues and ultimate triggers of performance deterioration there seems to be a consensus in the perception of key informants that the performance of the gezira scheme has deteriorated although identifying the start and the reasons of this process is not simple in fact such a deterioration might have occurred in three to four waves first in the mid 1970s the scheme witnessed a period of unattended irrigation when farmers started to do what they wanted young people moved away elderly tenants were not able to run the farm alone and sharecroppers were hired to do the farming it was the end of family based agriculture since share croppers had no connection to the land came from rain fed agriculture did not know the gezira system and worked only in the morning to open the fop field outlet pipe and let it run expert interview 2 march 2016 with increased crop diversity the balance of the gravity flow system in gezira was disturbed expert interview 6 march 2015 further since the 1970s irrigation started during rainy season which led to cost explosion and a drastic increase of sediments times four expert interview 4 march 2016 however it is difficult to exactly determine the deterioration time point and reasons since there is limited to no time series data for performance indicators however a common perception of deterioration since late 60 s or and 70 s is strongly held among experts second with the switch from the joint to the individual account system in 1981 i e instead of flat taxes compensating the government for water and land services a tenant needs to pay incurred input costs from his individual account problems of inadequate maintenance and deficient cost recovery started expert interview 9 march 2016 however other interviewed experts did not share this view third after 1992 private banks got involved in agricultural finance in the scheme replacing the bank of sudan s interest rate free loans and some experts see this as a negative moment due to expensive loans deterioration of services and a delay of the irrigation season expert interviews 3 4 march 2016 finally while there is some evidence that the gezira scheme started to deteriorate prior to the 2005 gezira act this act did not stop this process elshaikh et al 2018 moreover some experts indicated several problems resulting from the act which was intended to reduce governmental expenditures there are many problems mentioned by the interviewed stakeholders expert interviews 1 3 5 9 march 2016 stakeholders mention that there has been an infrastructure damage due to a lack of know how of the wuas e g over digging leading to the destruction of the gravity system of the scheme failure to collect fees no cleaning of weed or inadequate water use for different crop types furthermore there was a deterioration of infrastructure inspection and maintenance after the government sold vehicles to employees who were not willing to use them anymore considering these technical problems some interviewed experts argued that these issues would have been solvable if the wider political and economic contexts were suitable and they pointed out to larger issues such as the withdrawal of government funding or demographic changes e g young people moving to the cities and ending farming as a family business it has also been difficult to attract foreign investors e g from china or the gulf states to the gezira scheme due to its complicated reality with many powerful farmers and vague institutional and management set ups as well as unclear land use rights expert interview 9 march 2016 4 1 2 wider issues and splits in professional cultures another contextual issue more specific to the management of the gezira scheme is that of the professional and cultural split between water engineers and agriculturalists which has become evident in the wake of the exchange of irrigation responsibilities between ministries when the responsibility for irrigation was moved from the ministry of water to the ministry of agriculture irrigation engineers preferably with experience in the gezira scheme were needed at the latter ministry to continue their job of maintaining the outlets from the major canals however engineers refused to move to the ministry of agriculture it was a question of dignity the minister of agriculture discussed face to face with the 30 top engineers but all refused he found some people among the more junior engineers expert interview 9 march 2016 this was confirmed by other experts saying that those engineers refused to work with the gezira board it was not about salary but about social status according to them when you are specialized in irrigation you cannot work for agriculturalists therefore the gezira board did not have an adequate number of engineers this effected the output of the whole things and resulted in a low productivity expert interview 4 march 2016 many of the interviewed engineers regarded negatively the transfer of the irrigation tasks to the ministry of agriculture in the wake of the gezira act and subsequent reforms this decision was reversed only in 2015 their perception is that gezira s problems are not merely institutional but rather an institutional technical challenge in fact the water ministry has been alienated by the original 2005 reforms and even further by the 2010 decree transferring all irrigation responsibilities to the sgb 4 1 3 farmers power the gezira reform empowering wuas was a long slow and controversial process with the irrigation management transfer to farmers barely taking place because of the lack of funding for canal rehabilitation that was a pre requisite for handover salman 2010 indeed the farmers themselves were a powerful group but had little trust in public institutions and the sgb in fact prior to the 2005 reforms farmers have been criticizing the sgb for being overstaffed inefficient or incompetent while they demanded wuas to be in charge expert interview 10 march 2016 particularly in 2003 mistrust grew as rain fed mechanized farmers endured a crop loss due to a shortage in rainfall in the northern parts some farmers perceived the government s withdrawal from the scheme as a sort of escape from due compensation for rain fed based farmers who were then asked to work like other farmers but looking back it was a trap expert interview 2 march 2016 while farmer unions were supporting the 2005 reforms some experts questioned the representativeness of these unions there are about 140 000 farmers in the gezira scheme with different backgrounds while the unions have been criticized for being pro government not inclusive or seeking more influence in the scheme in fact in march 2015 the relationship between the government and the unions reached a low point as some news outlets reported the farmer unions of the gezira scheme to have planned an election boycott in coordination with opposition forces accordingly the unions were using visits to villages speeches in public markets cars fitted with loudspeakers and tours to remote areas to advocate for an election boycott sudan tribune 2015 six months later in september 2015 the unions were dissolved which provoked an outcry and was considered as an attempt to break up the unity of farmers radio dabanga 2015b and a prediction that gezira farmers will now be replaced by figures loyal to the ruling national congress party radio dabanga 2015a these developments might have had wider implications gezira farmers are residents of the hamdi triangle whose support is was considered vital for the regime this is interesting to consider in the wake of the 2019 revolution at the level of the gezira scheme it can be said that the negative relations and the lack of cooperation among stakeholders have impeded reforms from addressing any managerial and technical problems 4 2 farmer s perception 4 2 1 survey results the perception survey gauged the views of selected farmers on the performance of the irrigation scheme after the 2005 reforms the objectives of these reforms as well as their general perception of the post reform period on the scheme s performance tables 2 and 3 the responses indicate that there is generally a perceived deterioration of the scheme after the 2005 reforms at the same time the overall deterioration tendency is not significant with some issues e g conflicts among farmers indicated to be slightly less further the level of participation of farmers is perceived to not have changed significantly because of the reforms here the reforms brought crop choice and irrigation freedom for the farmers which might have reduced the occurrence of conflicts on the operational level without changing the perception of the farmers regarding the participation requirement in the management of the scheme one needs to note that when disaggregating the responses based on the educational background the deterioration of the operational performance adequacy and timing of water delivery and fairness of water distribution is overwhelmingly perceived by less educated farmers however due to the small sample size it is not possible to judge that this trend will hold for the whole scheme some interviewed experts mentioned that better educated and wealthier farmers could have benefited more from the reforms they explained that more affluent farmers could afford pumps and equipment to exploit the freedoms associated with the reforms as mentioned earlier the transfer of irrigation responsibility was limited in scale since it was not much practiced here richer farmers were more able to organize update their systems and thus manage irrigation tasks themselves other farmers did not participate because the required rehabilitation could not be undertaken furthermore farmers perceive the costs to have remained the same or increased slightly and this can be explained by the ineffectiveness of the wuas with regard to fees collection with regard to the farmers post reform perception of the reforms objectives personal impacts and the management of the scheme results from relevant survey questions are in table 4 4 2 2 discussion of survey insights first it seems rather contradictory that most farmers saw their personal situation become better despite the perceived deterioration of the schemes performance in the same line the farmers reported that the costs became either higher or the same but apparently did not affect their personal situation this contradiction can be explained by the ineffectiveness of the fees collection system of the scheme or by the existence of multiple factors that can affect the farmers income second on the reforms objectives it is surprising that a significant number of farmers thought that the reform objective was to destroy them although this answer was not given as an option this might be explained by the timing of the survey which took place after the farmers unions were dissolved third farmers did not indicate any predominant factors for the performance deterioration of the scheme they seem to regard the bad shape of the scheme as a result of legacies of bad management missing economization the deterioration of infrastructure and missing finances in this overall context single issues such as training and the choice of technology are not seen the most relevant problems the wuas did not contribute to improving the development perspective of the scheme since they failed to offer an alternative institutional set up for the scheme s management or to contribute to its long term financial sustainability through higher collection rates of water fees finally the results indicate that the reforms objectives were not clearly transmitted to the farmers on the responsibility for irrigation management in the scheme nobody mentioned the ministry of agriculture although this was given as an option this ministry overtook the irrigation resort in 2011 and the scheme s irrigation responsibility in 2014 but lost both responsibilities to the water ministry in 2015 the farmers response indicate that they do not favour the idea of the irrigation being under the ministry of agriculture at the same time they see this responsibility to be under the sgb or the water ministry here it is quite interesting that the farmers do not see this responsibility to be primarily theirs as the 2005 act envisioned while the opinion of a small minority reflect the status quo i e irrigation as a shared responsibility between sgb and the water ministry the farmers were also asked about their overarching attitudes on whether they regard the reform as a mistake welcome the idea of wuas and require more trainings technical support or funds opinions were consistently spilt on all of these propositions which might indicate that participatory irrigation or irrigation responsibility transfer is not a unique or predominant concern of farmers 5 reform outlook and directions 5 1 impediments and reform derails the imt experience in sudan can be characterized as a recent experiment that needs to be understood by considering some unique features and conditions of the scheme in this section we introduce some of the specific conditions that might have led to reform derails and failures we also discuss some alternatives and solutions and refer to imt experiences elsewhere first the scope and timing of the imt reforms in the gezira scheme indicate that reforms might have been sudden and little prepared many of the stakeholders regard the reforms as a late trial to save an already deteriorating scheme furthermore the reforms represented a sweeping change without adequately piloting ideas such as wuas or other forms of farmers participation another important point is that in the gezira case the size of this scheme is quite large and therefore the farmers financial and governance capabilities differ widely similar to other experiences from developing countries the objectives and expectations from the gezira imt reforms might have been overambitious therefore the post reform period has witnessed setbacks and many reversal leading to halting the reforms and dissolving any farmers participation altogether in this context a gradual reform pathway can allow for experimentation of approaches and appropriate participation designs in large schemes imts reforms are one alternative which if designed right can help bring out benefits for irrigation governance and as a result better irrigation performance while there are other alternatives such as management contracts or water markets zekri and easter 2007 such alternatives need to be tested and deliberated in terms of advantages and disadvantages at the same time common property based solutions can be made refitted and better e g through material incentives for farmers to allow participation increasing empowerment of farmers or strengthening social relationships ostrom 2015 such incentives were largely absent in the imt reforms in the gezira scheme second one can postulate a lack of a conducive environment for the imt reforms this is mainly due to the political and developmental context of the scheme the scheme has witnessed decades of negligence poor management and performance deteriorations while imts can result in larger irrigated areas increased crop yields and increased farm income in other cases chaudhry 2018 choi et al 2016 garces restrepo et al 2007 such general conclusions on performance have not been confirmed in the gezira case study elshaikh et al 2018 in the gezira scheme the challenges might have been unique and it is difficult to transmit some failure factors to the gezira act failure for example the reliance on donors or the lack of power delegation to wuas e g heavy state involvement or unwillingness to delegate power can hinder the success of reforms bassi and kumar 2011 cambaza et al 2020 yakubov 2012 zinzani 2015 on the one hand variables such as reform opposition by some actors or donor led reforms can be confirmed for the gezira scheme however neither reform opposition nor the overreliance on donors have been explicitly given as overriding reasons for failure and especially not for the initial period of the reforms further national state interferences were arguably low since many interviewees perceive the reform as a way to abandon the scheme due to its financial costs in fact the common reasons in the responses of our interviewees relate mostly to the lack of capacities of farmers as well as the difficult developmental legacies of gezira scheme i e a highly politicized and complex mega scheme under a longstanding deterioration trend undergoing selective and half hearted reforms third imt reforms have led to institutional fuzziness and insecurities using qualitative data from interviews with farmers and key experts we showed that the imt in the gezira scheme has been poorly implemented while it was perceived rather negatively this is true even for farmers who were the target group which the irrigation transfer was supposed to be benefit in addition there have been a lack of clarity about roles and responsibilities of the wuas iand conflicts among ministries or even professional groups engineers vs agriculturalists these factors led to power struggles that de facto hindered the implementation of the reforms besides the awareness among farmers on the objectives and merits of the imt reforms can be seen as low this is similar to the study by bell et al 2013 who concluded for pakistan that the perception of stakeholders on their roles in the imt reforms differed from the designed organizational structure in fact inconsequent and adverse reform experiences are commonplace in water management while consensus building and peace making among institutions can help mitigate opposition and reform failure al saidi 2017 at the same time the system of free crop choice and irrigation transfer requires discipline and coordination both are difficult without improving the capacities of farmers to administer such responsibilities while addressing infrastructure deterioration first here it is important to explore ways that can empower farmers and ease opposition and interferences for example states can accompany imt reforms with bureaucratic reforms suhardiman 2013 or empower coordinating public water authorities to make imt work through technological interventions and a network of support rap and wester 2013 another study suggest that farmers empowerment can take place within irrigation bureaucracies through elections larger representation and creating responsive institutions wegerich and hussain 2016 5 2 contextualization and overall challenges sudan or the gezira scheme is a quiet recent example of imts reforms that have been implemented across the world since the 1960s although it is still difficult to evaluate the implementation and outcomes of imts due to the lack of consistent frameworks khadra et al 2018 2017 imt case studies have produced a range of factors influencing the success of these reforms thus imts have resulted in mixed experiences and a long list of success and failure factors cambaza et al 2020 playán et al 2018 in this section we highlight the importance of embedding imt reforms in more comprehensive frameworks in order to increase success first imt reforms need to be seen as a part of larger efforts of investments in irrigation management the reform experience of the gezira scheme highlights the importance of the wider context of scheme management and irrigation governance in fact the lack of consistent empirical evidence for the supposed superior performance of wuas is partly due to methodological issues i e methods and data used for linking performance changes to institutional reforms senanayake et al 2015 however imts might be more successful if embedded within a larger effort of sound irrigation governance and regulation the developmental legacies of the gezira scheme show that this scheme has been trapped in a low performance state in which yield is low farmers lack markets and growth opportunities and the scheme s financial sustainability is threatened fig 3 illustrate this trap of a low scheme performance leading to livelihood financial and infrastructure deteriorations which in turn reinforce bad performance here imt reforms need to be seen as a part of a larger package of governance remedies to address the low performance malaise in irrigation schemes often stakeholders and farmers mention how the lack of modernization investments technology transfer and maintenance has hindered any performance improvement in the scheme in fact alongside farmers perception the state of the infrastructure has been confirmed as an important factor for imt reforms in other cases bell et al 2013 choi et al 2016 garces restrepo et al 2007 playán et al 2018 here good governance and adequate regulations can break the low performance trap of irrigation schemes major reviews of imt experiences often state factors for hindering imt success such as the lack of legal institutionalization of farmers participation clear water rights supporting infrastructure markets incentives and adequate accountability measures coordination mechanisms or transparency cambaza et al 2020 merrey et al 2007 playán et al 2018 however such issues go beyond imt reform actions and relate the way we allocate resources and develop the irrigation sector a key aspect for successful imt reforms is related to the government s capacity to support farmers delegate power set up institutional framework and prevent the creation of a vacuum regarding maintenance of roads or major canals k akumu et al 2016 kakuta 2019 in the gezira scheme alongside the development of markets infrastructure and investments prioritizing irrigation management through a participatory transparent and equitable governance some features of a good irrigation governance is highly demanded by farmers and stakeholders second the participation and the formation of irrigators organizational set up for farmers participation need to be designed carefully and to consider soft issues such as trust and ownership of the reforms the idea to get farmers involved in management was in response to the realization that the huge infrastructure investments done in the 1950s and 1960s did not pay off meinzen dick 2014 further reasons for the promotion of imt included the need to reduce governmental expenditure and several assumptions about the superior economic performance by farmers accordingly wuas have more commitment ownership accountability and ability to achieve a better productivity cost efficient operation and maintenance of irrigation infrastructure garces restrepo et al 2007 samad and vermillion 1999 senanayake et al 2015 however these assumptions need to be tested on a case study basis and they need to consider the organization of farmers communities in the irrigation scheme in the gezira scheme farmers seem to not appreciate the motivation of the reforms in terms of reducing the public financial burden instead the reforms have been partly perceived as an act to abandon the scheme and to punish farmers such a mistrust is highly relevant as it undermines the reform ownership furthermore there is little evidence that the capacities of the farmers to organize and execute the operations of the wuas were available prior to the reform act the farmers were given little support during and after the reform until the reform was abandoned almost ten years after its initiation trust and support of the reform were decreasing as a result the theoretical assumptions about the superior performance of farmer based organizations did not materialize in fact they were not appropriately tested since there is little evidence of the wuas appreciating and carrying out their designated tasks 6 conclusions since the beginning of the 20th century irrigation schemes have mostly been in public hands with irrigation services provided by government agencies the argument in favour of imts cite that state run schemes often performed weakly due to the lack of capacity poor incentives and the limited ability to respond to demand changes further if governments did not have the resources to maintain and repair irrigation systems water users will not be willing to pay leading to uncollected uncovered bills in response imt was heralded as the answer to these problems wuas have been formed in many countries as recipients of irrigation management functions transferred to them from the government they were assumed to show more commitment ownership and efficiency in carrying out irrigation functions however the evidence of imt success is mixed and a plethora of success and failure factors was put forward in academic literature this paper looked at the imt reforms in the gezira scheme as one of the largest irrigation schemes in the world we highlighted the importance of considering longstanding development legacies the perception of key stakeholders such as farmers and the overall political economic context of the reforms the gezira imt case is documented as a retracted and failed reform experience that evidently did not improve the scheme performance our qualitative analysis provides nuanced narratives of this experience suggesting a poor implementation and an unconducive environment for the reforms farmers knowledge capacities and involvement are key for imt reforms but we found no evidence of these in our study on the one hand it is not surprising that imt reforms will fail if the target group is not adequately educated and empowered instead of merely pulling back from the scheme management the state needs to provide more support in terms of awareness raising clear institutional rules and an active role in rehabilitating infrastructure including roads and main canals the imt reforms represented an abrupt transfer of authority in a quite large scheme where farmers financial and organizational capacities vary from one area to another there is no evidence of a prior experimentation with different participation approaches of farmers or a gradual move to strengthen farming communities instead we documented how distrust and the lack of reform ownership led to farmers and experts perceiving the reforms as an effort to abandon the scheme on the other hand we elaborated on the complex cultural political developmental and performance related legacies of the gezira mega scheme these legacies are reflected in the longstanding performance deterioration clashes of professions instrumentalization of farmer unions by the state and a politicization of the reforms these factors constituted an unfavourable environment for the reforms the reforms have led to a state of institutional fuzziness and insecurity in which the farmers did not carry out envisioned tasks the awareness about the reform benefits was low while farmers were not adequately incentivized to participate in the wuas operations furthermore the ensuing conflicts over roles and responsibilities were not mitigated through adequate responses e g mediation or institutional peace making here the government did not take an active role in managing conflicts or delivering on some of its tasks such as canal rehabilitations at the same time farmers had little trust in governmental institutions and farmers unions suffered from a lack of representativeness and a susceptibility for political interferences addressing the schemes future needs to be reconstructed within a larger context of breaking the low performance trap through a revaluation of good irrigation governance as a holistic concept such a governance can involve among others property right based solutions ownerships economic regulation and an honest dialogue about the steps ahead successful imt cases show that the capacity of the government to advocate for the reforms and lead in facilitating their implementation is important building coalitions and alliances among key stakeholder organizations in favour of imts or different forms of participatory irrigation management can help promote the reforms above all a good irrigation governance prioritizes irrigation management as a key function that can put the scheme on a high performance pathway the financial sustainability of the scheme needs to be improved through a multi level approach that can include improving fees collection encouraging investments public private partnerships and piloting technologies or exemplary farms these ideas have been put forward by stakeholders who stress that public policies have a major role to play in promoting the scheme at the same time soft issues are equally important they include empowering farmers and civil society to participate in the schemes management improving marketization of products and designing equitable transparent and enforceable regulations despite the modest success many of the interviewed experts still regard the idea of wuas as conceptually interesting for the gezira scheme although they see the recovery of the scheme as a government s responsibility that requires political prioritization this is especially true after the loss of much of the oil revenues in the wake of the separation of south sudan in 2011 further after the completion of the construction of the ethiopian grand renaissance dam fewer sediments are expected at the gezira scheme the sudanese revolution which uttered a new political era since 2019 has also raised hopes of economic improvements e g lifting the sanctions and a better governance of the country s resources including sudan s huge potential for agricultural development these recent developments provide an opportunity to improve the infrastructure and to explore new institutional arrangements there are many possible directions for future reforms that are suggested by experts to be explored in future participatory and transparent reform processes e g restoring crop rotation division of the scheme into smaller units piloting wuas before upscaling and increasing capacities and trust of farmers declaration of competing interest

10506,participatory irrigation management pim has been broadly promoted by public administrators and donor organizations the reasons for this push include performance failures of state controlled irrigation schemes and the need to improve irrigation productivity for meeting rising food demands a popular reform for increasing participation and ownership is represented by irrigation management transfers imts imts mean replacing the government with the civil society farmers in irrigation management and they go beyond working with the public sector as in pim these widely implemented reforms produced mixed experiences besides the evaluation of imt cases is reliant on scarce quantitative data imts are also difficult to replicate due to methodological issues however qualitative research can engage with stakeholders perceptions and narratives especially the most relevant target group namely farmers we provide in this study stakeholders opinions and attitudes towards several waves of imt reforms in the gezira scheme in sudan this mega scheme is of high developmental and socio cultural importance for the country ever since the independence from the british empire using a perception survey and in depth interviews with key informants we illustrate the failure legacies to reform the gezira scheme by enhancing farmers participation through water user associations wuas while both farmers and experts have suggested a poor implementation inadequate farmers involvement and unclear objectives of the reforms the reforms recurrent failures are explained within complex historic and political contexts there are long standing legacies of development missteps of the gezira scheme with no clear and ultimate triggers of performance deterioration besides splits in professional cultures power imbalances political instrumentalization of farmers and the lack of farmers awareness or capacities are salient factors for understanding the poor state of the gezira scheme it is difficult for stand alone irrigation management reforms to be successful such reforms need to be embedded within a comprehensive policy package that prioritizes irrigation governance and proposes sound regulations based on clear roles consensus making and prior consultation keywords irrigation management transfer farmers perceptions gezira irrigation scheme sudan 1 introduction irrigation is seen as a solution to meet rising food demands across the world about 20 of cultivated land under irrigation produce 40 of the global food output unesco 2009 with irrigation crop yields per hectare and profitability are estimated to be higher than in rain fed agriculture darré et al 2019 garces restrepo et al 2007 lobell et al 2009 vico and porporato 2011 irrigation is found to contribute to poverty alleviation as it makes food more available and affordable for the poor due to higher productivity and lower risk of crop failure hussain and hanjra 2004 the development of irrigation schemes was greatly expanded after the second world war as governmental and international donor investments peaked in the 1970s according to seibert et al 2013 on a global level more than 300 million hectares are today equipped for irrigation 69 in asia 17 in america 8 in europe 4 in africa 2 in oceania with the majority 62 irrigated with surface water by consuming a 70 share of all freshwater withdrawn globally and up to 95 in developing countries agriculture is the largest water use sector seibert et al 2013 almost half of irrigated agriculture is practiced in only three countries china india and pakistan fao 2011 other areas of high irrigation density can be found in the us and along the nile river in egypt and sudan while food demand will increase by 50 globally by 2050 and 100 in developing countries today s agricultural demand for water resources is largely unsustainable due to the depletion of aquifers reduction of river flows degradation of ecosystems and the salinization of irrigated soil wwap 2015 in order to secure a world free from hunger and malnutrition agriculture needs to become more sustainable and resources use more efficient unwanted side effects of irrigation such as environmental damage and soil erosion need to be minimized at the same time extensive investment in irrigation infrastructure as seen around the world in the second half of the 20th century has proved to be insufficient in fact governments and international donors realized that there are serious management problems that inhibit the realization of irrigation schemes full potential in response management reforms were promoted in the guise of irrigation management transfers imts imt implies transferring the irrigation responsibility and authority from the public hands into civil societal actors such as the water user associations wuas or into private sector entities garces restrepo et al 2007 senanayake et al 2015 if irrigation management reforms involve merely working with and not replacing the government the term participatory irrigation management pim is used vermillion and sagardoy 1999 this irrigation subsector reform imt was heralded e g by donors as a recipe to reduce or even eliminate government expenditure for the operation and maintenance of irrigation infrastructure improve scheme efficiency and productivity as well as increase the income of farmers cambaza et al 2020 playán et al 2018 in the second half of the 20th century it has been promoted in tens of countries but with mixed results garces restrepo et al 2007 given the urgency to improve irrigated agriculture understanding if and how imt can live up to the expectations is highly important irrigation management is a key factor for water use efficiency and agricultural productivity alongside other factors such as infrastructure operation and maintenance o m land and water resources or cropping practices wwap 2015 there have been numerous case studies that evaluated the impact of imts on irrigation and water use performance these studies include relatively successful imt cases from india mishra et al 2011 mexico rap and wester 2013 and korea choi et al 2016 other cases reported imt failures on substantial issues such as irrigation scheme performance maintenance of infrastructure institutional set up of wuas or the collection of fees while the reasons and reform missteps vary across case study imt difficulties are reported from across the developing world e g in pakistan bell et al 2013 wegerich and hussain 2016 central asia yakubov 2012 india bassi and kumar 2011 indonesia suhardiman 2013 or ghana kakuta 2019 the impact direction of imts has also not been consistent for example in turkey irrigation associations improved collection of fees but not water use efficiency kibaroglu 2020 in central asian countries such as uzbekistan and kazakhstan imt implementation was not consequent in the different periods after the collapse of the soviet union while the involvement of state remained high zinzani 2016 2015 in fact fifty years after imt became a global trend evidence based research and the literature on post reform scheme performance are largely quantitative using performance key indicators kpis and less through qualitative analysis via farmers perceptions this poses several methodological difficulties to isolate and measure the impact of imt on scheme performance and shortcomings regarding the representativeness of the analyses senanayake et al 2015 there is little focus on farmers opinions and the perception of involved stakeholders which can vary greatly from one case to another senanayake et al 2015 in fact farmers as the irrigation water users are at the center of any imt process especially when responsibility is handed over to wuas thus it is important to understand their perceptions motivation capacity and needs furthermore the motivation behind imts is not studied thoroughly since the reduction of government expenditures is often cited as the main objective for introducing such reforms merrey et al 2007 vermillion 1997 the relevance of studying stakeholders perception of imt is arguably high due to their key role in imt implementation or more specifically the role of farmers in wuas the gezira scheme received a lot of attention from researchers and international organizations there are several studies on the development of the scheme and possible reasons for its poor performance al zayed et al 2016 2015 elshaikh et al 2018 plusquellec 1990 salman 2010 wallach 1988 world bank 2000 yet these studies have not yet gauged farmers and stakeholders opinions and attitudes towards several waves of imt and institutional reforms the objective of this study is to make a contribution to the wider discussion concerning if and how irrigation management transfer can lead to better irrigation management and ultimately greater food security environmental sustainability and poverty reduction this paper represents a reform outlook study that stresses the importance of soft issues such as addressing developmental legacies involvement of farmers the management of reform expectations awareness raising or good irrigation governance more specifically it looks at the perceptions of farmer groups and on site stakeholders of imt with the aim of exploring their understanding and lived experiences of the management reforms the paper also contextualizes irrigation management reforms of the gezira scheme within historic eras of state involvement in irrigation management in sudan and within international experiences of imt as such the study does not evaluate the success of the reforms the failure of the reforms is widely accepted as evident in the pullback of reforms package besides the paper does not evaluate gezira s scheme performance and the impact of imt as it is quite difficult to satisfactorily link imt reforms to the performance deterioration of the scheme although such detailed efforts exist e g elshaikh et al 2018 2 case study gezira irrigation scheme 2 1 gezira s key characteristics and reform timeline with a net command area of approximately 2 1 million feddan which corresponds to 882 000 ha the gezira scheme is one of the world s largest probably the largest irrigation scheme under one management it is located on the blue nile where the nile water is stored by the sennar dam and supplied to the field through an extensive network of canals consisting of two main canals 194 km major canals 2300 km minor canals 8000 km that feed tertiary canals locally called abu xx and then field ditches abu vi the plain fields are evenly and slightly sloped towards the northeast and allow for gravity irrigation fig 1 provides the key characteristics of the scheme the scheme was inaugurated with the construction of the sennar dam by the british in 1925 the initial objective was cotton production for britain s textile industry the scheme reached today s size with the managil extension through the construction of the roseiries dam in the early 1960s beyond the canalization network the scheme s infrastructure includes machinery equipment staff housing roads and vehicles the value of the infrastructure is roughly estimated to amount to eight billion usd and is an important asset of the government while around 12 000 farming families and thousands of state administrators usually live there eldaw 2004 during the first years after independence in 1956 cotton remained the main crop for export and sorghum the second as a stable food crop for the tenants in the mid 1970s agriculture was intensified and diversified by adding groundnuts vegetables and wheat impressive numbers materialized such as the gezira scheme representing less than 11 of sudan s cultivated area yet producing 60 of cotton 75 of wheat 35 of groundnuts verhoeven 2015 nation wide large scale irrigation was promoted and peaked at the end of the 1970s the price for the expansion of the area under irrigation was a reduction in agricultural efficiency in the gezira scheme the intensification and expansion have produced an impressive output in the short term but it contributed to the deterioration of the system in the long term this trend was reflected in the titles of early publications about the scheme arthur gaitskell s book from 1959 was called gezira a story of development in sudan not even twenty years later anthony barrett 1977 published the gezira scheme an illusion of development 2 2 overview of management change and reforms the gezira scheme has a unique land tenure arrangement after the establishment of the scheme the government either bought land or forced private owners to lease the land to the government for 40 years the basically dispossessed landowners became tenants land allotments were limited to the size of 15 30 feddan feddan equals around 0 4 ha after the expiration of the 1927 land ordinance no new system was arranged which still causes problems today ever since the management of the gezira scheme has been highly centralized in the hands of the sudan gezira board sgb the sgb determined the crop rotation plan including fallow period and was responsible for land management including levelling necessary to allow gravity flow which has been neglected since 1970s due to lack of resources and water management from minor to field canal the upper system was managed by the ministry of water and irrigation administratively the scheme was divided into 18 groups composed of five to seven blocks 114 in total headed by a block inspector the blocks were divided into a unit called number nimra 90 feddan which consisted of up to 18 hawashas farm tenant plot hussein et al 2002 in modern day sudan the gezira scheme witnessed different phases of relative prosperity after independence till the 1970s decline due to intensification increased water use and silt accumulation after the construction of the mangail extension in 1966 since the late 1970s liberalization during the 1990s and institutional reforms since early 2000s fig 1 provides a short historic trajectory the economic liberalization of the 1990s did not lead to the desired effect of increasing agricultural productivity based on a new incentive structure for farmers the government disengaged from the scheme but the private sector did not fill the gaps the scheme continued to deteriorate at an alarming rate in order to illustrate the major performance problems of the gezira scheme we summarize in the infographics in fig 2 key performance categories of the scheme and introduce selected performance indicators using data from secondary literature according to a 2000 world bank report the gezira scheme had become the least efficient schemes in world and needed to be institutionally reorganized salman 2010 mostly based on the world bank s recommendation the gezira scheme act was issued in 2005 and more than 1500 wuas one for each minor canal were established in 2007 this act represented the imt in the gezira scheme according to this act farm irrigation and management including collection of fees and weed cleaning were now the responsibilities of the wuas through the control of the minor canals and field canals the reform transferred the responsibility of field irrigation from the government to the farmers in the gezira scheme irrigation water reaches the field via the main canal major canals minor canals and eventually the field canals through gated field outlets pipes fops the field canals abu xx irrigate 90 feddan through 9 small field ditches abu vi which means that that one abu vi irrigates 10 feddan before 2005 block inspectors from the sgb were responsible for the minor canals and engineers from the ministry of water for the outlets from the major canals the 2005 gezira act replaced the 1984 act adopted after the last great rehabilitation project in 1983 and the 1927 gezira land ordinance which had forced private landowners to lease their land to the government however already in 2009 the ministry of agriculture and forestry admitted in a report that these reforms has been a total failure since the disposition of scheme s assets the crop choice freedom and the establishment of wuas lacking needed capacities have resulted in irrecoverable damage to the scheme salman 2010 table 1 provides a mapping of stakeholders as well as their roles and interests before and after the gezira act in the years after the 2005 reforms the performance of the gezira scheme did not pick up which led to the 2014 gezira act amendment this amendment replaced the wuas with agricultural cooperatives farmer unions while the scheme s maintenance and management of the irrigation including water allocation was transferred to the ministry of agriculture and irrigation the government was to finance the scheme through water charges and to appoint a scheme s governor by the republic s president instead of the elected general manager of the scheme here the ministry of water resources was not mentioned in the reform since in 2011 irrigation was moved to the ministry of agriculture from the ministry of water while electricity was given to the ministry of water resources and electricity in the same year in 2015 water management was given back to the now called ministry of water resources irrigation and electricity transferred from the now called the ministry of agriculture and forestry the reforms of 2014 met a strong opposition from farmers since it increased the role of the governor and pushed farmers into producers associations according to a university of khartoum professor this decision was made because the government is betting on the weakness of the financial administrative and logistical capabilities of the associations and their failure in the end to be given to the affiliates of the national congress party cited in radio dabanga 2015a in september 2015 the farmer unions known as wuas prior to the 2014 reforms were dissolved through the constitutional decree 32 which effectively meant a solidification of responsibilities for water management of the scheme under the ministry of water resources irrigation and energy while decision making systems and the organizational structure of the scheme become unresolved hydraulic research center 2016 3 method and data in order to gauge the perception of the stakeholders on the different episodes of the imt reforms in the gezira scheme this study largely relies on qualitative data using key informants interviews a farmers survey and a mapping of stakeholders and their declared attitudes ten expert interviews semi structured were conducted with the leadership and a staff from the gezira board 2 the ministry of water resources irrigation and electricity 1 the hydraulics research center 4 the agricultural research center 1 and independent experts 2 these are mostly stakeholders located in the gezira scheme area and work almost exclusively on this scheme these experts have been identified during a first visit to the study area in december 2015 the final number and selection of experts was a result of their availability and willingness to contribute to this study during a second field visit in march 2016 interview protocols served as documentation the experts did not necessarily represent the organizations they are working for but rather their personal perception further since the paper is primarily concerned with farmers involvement and their perception of the irrigation management reform a structured survey with multiple choice and open ended questions was conducted in 2016 the survey aimed at gathering information on farmers experience and perception of changes in operational maintenance economic and managerial performance of the scheme before and after 2005 particularly the survey assesses qualitative variables such as farmers knowledge and level of trust regarding the initiated reforms the survey borrows from iwmi methodology to assess imts samad and vermillion 1999 out of the total 50 interviewed farmers 15 were interviewed over phone in order in to get voices from other areas of the vast gezira scheme and not only from around wad medani farmers were sampled based on recommendations from local research institutions on representative farmers villages to visit based on prior research experiences several small groups of farmers were instructed about the survey and asked to fill in the survey individually they were supervised by a helper from a research institution in wad madni sudan who addressed farmers questions the translated survey can be found in annex 1 4 results 4 1 stakeholders perception on gezira s past performance and reforms 4 1 1 technical issues and ultimate triggers of performance deterioration there seems to be a consensus in the perception of key informants that the performance of the gezira scheme has deteriorated although identifying the start and the reasons of this process is not simple in fact such a deterioration might have occurred in three to four waves first in the mid 1970s the scheme witnessed a period of unattended irrigation when farmers started to do what they wanted young people moved away elderly tenants were not able to run the farm alone and sharecroppers were hired to do the farming it was the end of family based agriculture since share croppers had no connection to the land came from rain fed agriculture did not know the gezira system and worked only in the morning to open the fop field outlet pipe and let it run expert interview 2 march 2016 with increased crop diversity the balance of the gravity flow system in gezira was disturbed expert interview 6 march 2015 further since the 1970s irrigation started during rainy season which led to cost explosion and a drastic increase of sediments times four expert interview 4 march 2016 however it is difficult to exactly determine the deterioration time point and reasons since there is limited to no time series data for performance indicators however a common perception of deterioration since late 60 s or and 70 s is strongly held among experts second with the switch from the joint to the individual account system in 1981 i e instead of flat taxes compensating the government for water and land services a tenant needs to pay incurred input costs from his individual account problems of inadequate maintenance and deficient cost recovery started expert interview 9 march 2016 however other interviewed experts did not share this view third after 1992 private banks got involved in agricultural finance in the scheme replacing the bank of sudan s interest rate free loans and some experts see this as a negative moment due to expensive loans deterioration of services and a delay of the irrigation season expert interviews 3 4 march 2016 finally while there is some evidence that the gezira scheme started to deteriorate prior to the 2005 gezira act this act did not stop this process elshaikh et al 2018 moreover some experts indicated several problems resulting from the act which was intended to reduce governmental expenditures there are many problems mentioned by the interviewed stakeholders expert interviews 1 3 5 9 march 2016 stakeholders mention that there has been an infrastructure damage due to a lack of know how of the wuas e g over digging leading to the destruction of the gravity system of the scheme failure to collect fees no cleaning of weed or inadequate water use for different crop types furthermore there was a deterioration of infrastructure inspection and maintenance after the government sold vehicles to employees who were not willing to use them anymore considering these technical problems some interviewed experts argued that these issues would have been solvable if the wider political and economic contexts were suitable and they pointed out to larger issues such as the withdrawal of government funding or demographic changes e g young people moving to the cities and ending farming as a family business it has also been difficult to attract foreign investors e g from china or the gulf states to the gezira scheme due to its complicated reality with many powerful farmers and vague institutional and management set ups as well as unclear land use rights expert interview 9 march 2016 4 1 2 wider issues and splits in professional cultures another contextual issue more specific to the management of the gezira scheme is that of the professional and cultural split between water engineers and agriculturalists which has become evident in the wake of the exchange of irrigation responsibilities between ministries when the responsibility for irrigation was moved from the ministry of water to the ministry of agriculture irrigation engineers preferably with experience in the gezira scheme were needed at the latter ministry to continue their job of maintaining the outlets from the major canals however engineers refused to move to the ministry of agriculture it was a question of dignity the minister of agriculture discussed face to face with the 30 top engineers but all refused he found some people among the more junior engineers expert interview 9 march 2016 this was confirmed by other experts saying that those engineers refused to work with the gezira board it was not about salary but about social status according to them when you are specialized in irrigation you cannot work for agriculturalists therefore the gezira board did not have an adequate number of engineers this effected the output of the whole things and resulted in a low productivity expert interview 4 march 2016 many of the interviewed engineers regarded negatively the transfer of the irrigation tasks to the ministry of agriculture in the wake of the gezira act and subsequent reforms this decision was reversed only in 2015 their perception is that gezira s problems are not merely institutional but rather an institutional technical challenge in fact the water ministry has been alienated by the original 2005 reforms and even further by the 2010 decree transferring all irrigation responsibilities to the sgb 4 1 3 farmers power the gezira reform empowering wuas was a long slow and controversial process with the irrigation management transfer to farmers barely taking place because of the lack of funding for canal rehabilitation that was a pre requisite for handover salman 2010 indeed the farmers themselves were a powerful group but had little trust in public institutions and the sgb in fact prior to the 2005 reforms farmers have been criticizing the sgb for being overstaffed inefficient or incompetent while they demanded wuas to be in charge expert interview 10 march 2016 particularly in 2003 mistrust grew as rain fed mechanized farmers endured a crop loss due to a shortage in rainfall in the northern parts some farmers perceived the government s withdrawal from the scheme as a sort of escape from due compensation for rain fed based farmers who were then asked to work like other farmers but looking back it was a trap expert interview 2 march 2016 while farmer unions were supporting the 2005 reforms some experts questioned the representativeness of these unions there are about 140 000 farmers in the gezira scheme with different backgrounds while the unions have been criticized for being pro government not inclusive or seeking more influence in the scheme in fact in march 2015 the relationship between the government and the unions reached a low point as some news outlets reported the farmer unions of the gezira scheme to have planned an election boycott in coordination with opposition forces accordingly the unions were using visits to villages speeches in public markets cars fitted with loudspeakers and tours to remote areas to advocate for an election boycott sudan tribune 2015 six months later in september 2015 the unions were dissolved which provoked an outcry and was considered as an attempt to break up the unity of farmers radio dabanga 2015b and a prediction that gezira farmers will now be replaced by figures loyal to the ruling national congress party radio dabanga 2015a these developments might have had wider implications gezira farmers are residents of the hamdi triangle whose support is was considered vital for the regime this is interesting to consider in the wake of the 2019 revolution at the level of the gezira scheme it can be said that the negative relations and the lack of cooperation among stakeholders have impeded reforms from addressing any managerial and technical problems 4 2 farmer s perception 4 2 1 survey results the perception survey gauged the views of selected farmers on the performance of the irrigation scheme after the 2005 reforms the objectives of these reforms as well as their general perception of the post reform period on the scheme s performance tables 2 and 3 the responses indicate that there is generally a perceived deterioration of the scheme after the 2005 reforms at the same time the overall deterioration tendency is not significant with some issues e g conflicts among farmers indicated to be slightly less further the level of participation of farmers is perceived to not have changed significantly because of the reforms here the reforms brought crop choice and irrigation freedom for the farmers which might have reduced the occurrence of conflicts on the operational level without changing the perception of the farmers regarding the participation requirement in the management of the scheme one needs to note that when disaggregating the responses based on the educational background the deterioration of the operational performance adequacy and timing of water delivery and fairness of water distribution is overwhelmingly perceived by less educated farmers however due to the small sample size it is not possible to judge that this trend will hold for the whole scheme some interviewed experts mentioned that better educated and wealthier farmers could have benefited more from the reforms they explained that more affluent farmers could afford pumps and equipment to exploit the freedoms associated with the reforms as mentioned earlier the transfer of irrigation responsibility was limited in scale since it was not much practiced here richer farmers were more able to organize update their systems and thus manage irrigation tasks themselves other farmers did not participate because the required rehabilitation could not be undertaken furthermore farmers perceive the costs to have remained the same or increased slightly and this can be explained by the ineffectiveness of the wuas with regard to fees collection with regard to the farmers post reform perception of the reforms objectives personal impacts and the management of the scheme results from relevant survey questions are in table 4 4 2 2 discussion of survey insights first it seems rather contradictory that most farmers saw their personal situation become better despite the perceived deterioration of the schemes performance in the same line the farmers reported that the costs became either higher or the same but apparently did not affect their personal situation this contradiction can be explained by the ineffectiveness of the fees collection system of the scheme or by the existence of multiple factors that can affect the farmers income second on the reforms objectives it is surprising that a significant number of farmers thought that the reform objective was to destroy them although this answer was not given as an option this might be explained by the timing of the survey which took place after the farmers unions were dissolved third farmers did not indicate any predominant factors for the performance deterioration of the scheme they seem to regard the bad shape of the scheme as a result of legacies of bad management missing economization the deterioration of infrastructure and missing finances in this overall context single issues such as training and the choice of technology are not seen the most relevant problems the wuas did not contribute to improving the development perspective of the scheme since they failed to offer an alternative institutional set up for the scheme s management or to contribute to its long term financial sustainability through higher collection rates of water fees finally the results indicate that the reforms objectives were not clearly transmitted to the farmers on the responsibility for irrigation management in the scheme nobody mentioned the ministry of agriculture although this was given as an option this ministry overtook the irrigation resort in 2011 and the scheme s irrigation responsibility in 2014 but lost both responsibilities to the water ministry in 2015 the farmers response indicate that they do not favour the idea of the irrigation being under the ministry of agriculture at the same time they see this responsibility to be under the sgb or the water ministry here it is quite interesting that the farmers do not see this responsibility to be primarily theirs as the 2005 act envisioned while the opinion of a small minority reflect the status quo i e irrigation as a shared responsibility between sgb and the water ministry the farmers were also asked about their overarching attitudes on whether they regard the reform as a mistake welcome the idea of wuas and require more trainings technical support or funds opinions were consistently spilt on all of these propositions which might indicate that participatory irrigation or irrigation responsibility transfer is not a unique or predominant concern of farmers 5 reform outlook and directions 5 1 impediments and reform derails the imt experience in sudan can be characterized as a recent experiment that needs to be understood by considering some unique features and conditions of the scheme in this section we introduce some of the specific conditions that might have led to reform derails and failures we also discuss some alternatives and solutions and refer to imt experiences elsewhere first the scope and timing of the imt reforms in the gezira scheme indicate that reforms might have been sudden and little prepared many of the stakeholders regard the reforms as a late trial to save an already deteriorating scheme furthermore the reforms represented a sweeping change without adequately piloting ideas such as wuas or other forms of farmers participation another important point is that in the gezira case the size of this scheme is quite large and therefore the farmers financial and governance capabilities differ widely similar to other experiences from developing countries the objectives and expectations from the gezira imt reforms might have been overambitious therefore the post reform period has witnessed setbacks and many reversal leading to halting the reforms and dissolving any farmers participation altogether in this context a gradual reform pathway can allow for experimentation of approaches and appropriate participation designs in large schemes imts reforms are one alternative which if designed right can help bring out benefits for irrigation governance and as a result better irrigation performance while there are other alternatives such as management contracts or water markets zekri and easter 2007 such alternatives need to be tested and deliberated in terms of advantages and disadvantages at the same time common property based solutions can be made refitted and better e g through material incentives for farmers to allow participation increasing empowerment of farmers or strengthening social relationships ostrom 2015 such incentives were largely absent in the imt reforms in the gezira scheme second one can postulate a lack of a conducive environment for the imt reforms this is mainly due to the political and developmental context of the scheme the scheme has witnessed decades of negligence poor management and performance deteriorations while imts can result in larger irrigated areas increased crop yields and increased farm income in other cases chaudhry 2018 choi et al 2016 garces restrepo et al 2007 such general conclusions on performance have not been confirmed in the gezira case study elshaikh et al 2018 in the gezira scheme the challenges might have been unique and it is difficult to transmit some failure factors to the gezira act failure for example the reliance on donors or the lack of power delegation to wuas e g heavy state involvement or unwillingness to delegate power can hinder the success of reforms bassi and kumar 2011 cambaza et al 2020 yakubov 2012 zinzani 2015 on the one hand variables such as reform opposition by some actors or donor led reforms can be confirmed for the gezira scheme however neither reform opposition nor the overreliance on donors have been explicitly given as overriding reasons for failure and especially not for the initial period of the reforms further national state interferences were arguably low since many interviewees perceive the reform as a way to abandon the scheme due to its financial costs in fact the common reasons in the responses of our interviewees relate mostly to the lack of capacities of farmers as well as the difficult developmental legacies of gezira scheme i e a highly politicized and complex mega scheme under a longstanding deterioration trend undergoing selective and half hearted reforms third imt reforms have led to institutional fuzziness and insecurities using qualitative data from interviews with farmers and key experts we showed that the imt in the gezira scheme has been poorly implemented while it was perceived rather negatively this is true even for farmers who were the target group which the irrigation transfer was supposed to be benefit in addition there have been a lack of clarity about roles and responsibilities of the wuas iand conflicts among ministries or even professional groups engineers vs agriculturalists these factors led to power struggles that de facto hindered the implementation of the reforms besides the awareness among farmers on the objectives and merits of the imt reforms can be seen as low this is similar to the study by bell et al 2013 who concluded for pakistan that the perception of stakeholders on their roles in the imt reforms differed from the designed organizational structure in fact inconsequent and adverse reform experiences are commonplace in water management while consensus building and peace making among institutions can help mitigate opposition and reform failure al saidi 2017 at the same time the system of free crop choice and irrigation transfer requires discipline and coordination both are difficult without improving the capacities of farmers to administer such responsibilities while addressing infrastructure deterioration first here it is important to explore ways that can empower farmers and ease opposition and interferences for example states can accompany imt reforms with bureaucratic reforms suhardiman 2013 or empower coordinating public water authorities to make imt work through technological interventions and a network of support rap and wester 2013 another study suggest that farmers empowerment can take place within irrigation bureaucracies through elections larger representation and creating responsive institutions wegerich and hussain 2016 5 2 contextualization and overall challenges sudan or the gezira scheme is a quiet recent example of imts reforms that have been implemented across the world since the 1960s although it is still difficult to evaluate the implementation and outcomes of imts due to the lack of consistent frameworks khadra et al 2018 2017 imt case studies have produced a range of factors influencing the success of these reforms thus imts have resulted in mixed experiences and a long list of success and failure factors cambaza et al 2020 playán et al 2018 in this section we highlight the importance of embedding imt reforms in more comprehensive frameworks in order to increase success first imt reforms need to be seen as a part of larger efforts of investments in irrigation management the reform experience of the gezira scheme highlights the importance of the wider context of scheme management and irrigation governance in fact the lack of consistent empirical evidence for the supposed superior performance of wuas is partly due to methodological issues i e methods and data used for linking performance changes to institutional reforms senanayake et al 2015 however imts might be more successful if embedded within a larger effort of sound irrigation governance and regulation the developmental legacies of the gezira scheme show that this scheme has been trapped in a low performance state in which yield is low farmers lack markets and growth opportunities and the scheme s financial sustainability is threatened fig 3 illustrate this trap of a low scheme performance leading to livelihood financial and infrastructure deteriorations which in turn reinforce bad performance here imt reforms need to be seen as a part of a larger package of governance remedies to address the low performance malaise in irrigation schemes often stakeholders and farmers mention how the lack of modernization investments technology transfer and maintenance has hindered any performance improvement in the scheme in fact alongside farmers perception the state of the infrastructure has been confirmed as an important factor for imt reforms in other cases bell et al 2013 choi et al 2016 garces restrepo et al 2007 playán et al 2018 here good governance and adequate regulations can break the low performance trap of irrigation schemes major reviews of imt experiences often state factors for hindering imt success such as the lack of legal institutionalization of farmers participation clear water rights supporting infrastructure markets incentives and adequate accountability measures coordination mechanisms or transparency cambaza et al 2020 merrey et al 2007 playán et al 2018 however such issues go beyond imt reform actions and relate the way we allocate resources and develop the irrigation sector a key aspect for successful imt reforms is related to the government s capacity to support farmers delegate power set up institutional framework and prevent the creation of a vacuum regarding maintenance of roads or major canals k akumu et al 2016 kakuta 2019 in the gezira scheme alongside the development of markets infrastructure and investments prioritizing irrigation management through a participatory transparent and equitable governance some features of a good irrigation governance is highly demanded by farmers and stakeholders second the participation and the formation of irrigators organizational set up for farmers participation need to be designed carefully and to consider soft issues such as trust and ownership of the reforms the idea to get farmers involved in management was in response to the realization that the huge infrastructure investments done in the 1950s and 1960s did not pay off meinzen dick 2014 further reasons for the promotion of imt included the need to reduce governmental expenditure and several assumptions about the superior economic performance by farmers accordingly wuas have more commitment ownership accountability and ability to achieve a better productivity cost efficient operation and maintenance of irrigation infrastructure garces restrepo et al 2007 samad and vermillion 1999 senanayake et al 2015 however these assumptions need to be tested on a case study basis and they need to consider the organization of farmers communities in the irrigation scheme in the gezira scheme farmers seem to not appreciate the motivation of the reforms in terms of reducing the public financial burden instead the reforms have been partly perceived as an act to abandon the scheme and to punish farmers such a mistrust is highly relevant as it undermines the reform ownership furthermore there is little evidence that the capacities of the farmers to organize and execute the operations of the wuas were available prior to the reform act the farmers were given little support during and after the reform until the reform was abandoned almost ten years after its initiation trust and support of the reform were decreasing as a result the theoretical assumptions about the superior performance of farmer based organizations did not materialize in fact they were not appropriately tested since there is little evidence of the wuas appreciating and carrying out their designated tasks 6 conclusions since the beginning of the 20th century irrigation schemes have mostly been in public hands with irrigation services provided by government agencies the argument in favour of imts cite that state run schemes often performed weakly due to the lack of capacity poor incentives and the limited ability to respond to demand changes further if governments did not have the resources to maintain and repair irrigation systems water users will not be willing to pay leading to uncollected uncovered bills in response imt was heralded as the answer to these problems wuas have been formed in many countries as recipients of irrigation management functions transferred to them from the government they were assumed to show more commitment ownership and efficiency in carrying out irrigation functions however the evidence of imt success is mixed and a plethora of success and failure factors was put forward in academic literature this paper looked at the imt reforms in the gezira scheme as one of the largest irrigation schemes in the world we highlighted the importance of considering longstanding development legacies the perception of key stakeholders such as farmers and the overall political economic context of the reforms the gezira imt case is documented as a retracted and failed reform experience that evidently did not improve the scheme performance our qualitative analysis provides nuanced narratives of this experience suggesting a poor implementation and an unconducive environment for the reforms farmers knowledge capacities and involvement are key for imt reforms but we found no evidence of these in our study on the one hand it is not surprising that imt reforms will fail if the target group is not adequately educated and empowered instead of merely pulling back from the scheme management the state needs to provide more support in terms of awareness raising clear institutional rules and an active role in rehabilitating infrastructure including roads and main canals the imt reforms represented an abrupt transfer of authority in a quite large scheme where farmers financial and organizational capacities vary from one area to another there is no evidence of a prior experimentation with different participation approaches of farmers or a gradual move to strengthen farming communities instead we documented how distrust and the lack of reform ownership led to farmers and experts perceiving the reforms as an effort to abandon the scheme on the other hand we elaborated on the complex cultural political developmental and performance related legacies of the gezira mega scheme these legacies are reflected in the longstanding performance deterioration clashes of professions instrumentalization of farmer unions by the state and a politicization of the reforms these factors constituted an unfavourable environment for the reforms the reforms have led to a state of institutional fuzziness and insecurity in which the farmers did not carry out envisioned tasks the awareness about the reform benefits was low while farmers were not adequately incentivized to participate in the wuas operations furthermore the ensuing conflicts over roles and responsibilities were not mitigated through adequate responses e g mediation or institutional peace making here the government did not take an active role in managing conflicts or delivering on some of its tasks such as canal rehabilitations at the same time farmers had little trust in governmental institutions and farmers unions suffered from a lack of representativeness and a susceptibility for political interferences addressing the schemes future needs to be reconstructed within a larger context of breaking the low performance trap through a revaluation of good irrigation governance as a holistic concept such a governance can involve among others property right based solutions ownerships economic regulation and an honest dialogue about the steps ahead successful imt cases show that the capacity of the government to advocate for the reforms and lead in facilitating their implementation is important building coalitions and alliances among key stakeholder organizations in favour of imts or different forms of participatory irrigation management can help promote the reforms above all a good irrigation governance prioritizes irrigation management as a key function that can put the scheme on a high performance pathway the financial sustainability of the scheme needs to be improved through a multi level approach that can include improving fees collection encouraging investments public private partnerships and piloting technologies or exemplary farms these ideas have been put forward by stakeholders who stress that public policies have a major role to play in promoting the scheme at the same time soft issues are equally important they include empowering farmers and civil society to participate in the schemes management improving marketization of products and designing equitable transparent and enforceable regulations despite the modest success many of the interviewed experts still regard the idea of wuas as conceptually interesting for the gezira scheme although they see the recovery of the scheme as a government s responsibility that requires political prioritization this is especially true after the loss of much of the oil revenues in the wake of the separation of south sudan in 2011 further after the completion of the construction of the ethiopian grand renaissance dam fewer sediments are expected at the gezira scheme the sudanese revolution which uttered a new political era since 2019 has also raised hopes of economic improvements e g lifting the sanctions and a better governance of the country s resources including sudan s huge potential for agricultural development these recent developments provide an opportunity to improve the infrastructure and to explore new institutional arrangements there are many possible directions for future reforms that are suggested by experts to be explored in future participatory and transparent reform processes e g restoring crop rotation division of the scheme into smaller units piloting wuas before upscaling and increasing capacities and trust of farmers declaration of competing interest

10507,knowledge of root systems and soil water status across the root zone is crucial in developing effective cropping technologies mulching improves soil water status and root water transport for increasing grain yield therefore a field experiment with five treatments 1 plastic film mulching ridge and non mulching furrow rf 2 full plastic mulching with conventional flat cultivation fpm 3 straw mulching with conventional flat cultivation sm 4 partial plastic mulching with conventional flat cultivation ppm and 5 non mulch with conventional flat cultivation ck was conducted during 2018 and 2019 in the eastern loess plateau of china the total root biomass and the grain yield of all treatments were lower in 2019 than that of 2018 because of lower rainfall however all the mulching treatments improved root growth in both growing seasons mainly on the top 30 cm soil depth which led to a distinct effect on grain yield as compared with ck fpm produced the highest total root parameters in 2018 and at 45 das in 2019 due to the highest soil moisture content mainly in 0 30 cm soil depth however root biomass of fpm in 30 100 cm soil depth was lower than that of ppm rf and sm because assimilate at reproductive stage was mostly for plant and seed growth than root growth thus there was negative correlation between grain yield and root biomass below 30 cm soil depth especially at grain filling stage over two growing seasons soil moisture content smc under fpm was 8 4 0 6 8 8 and 11 1 more than that of rf sm ppm and ck fpm reduced soil evaporation improved smc root distribution and transpiration rate consequently increased grain yield and net profit therefore fpm is an effective cropping system for improving the synchronization of soil water transport and root water uptake for maize production in rain fed farming keywords mulching soil moisture content root growth sap flow maize yield loess plateau 1 introduction many studies indicated that climate change may aggravate the risk of drought and reduce agricultural production in arid and semi arid areas thus it is a key issue to emphasize improving crop yields with fewer water resources lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 misra 2014 to mitigating water shortage and reducing environmental problems the loess plateau in northwest china covers an area of 623 800 km2 and has a population of about 90 million the annual precipitation in this region is ranging from 150 300 mm in the north to 500 700 mm in the south and its climate is mostly semi arid li and xiao 1992 most of the cropland on the loess plateau is dryland rain fed farming and water scarcity is the primary limiting factors for agriculture in this region liu et al 2010 to increase the water use efficiency by inhibiting unproductive water loss by adopting alternative field management practices is one of the main objectives for innovating agricultural water management mulching practices by using the straw gravel soil crust biodegradable film or plastic film to the soil surface gao et al 2014 jia et al 2018 li et al 2013a maïga yaleu et al 2013 wang et al 2018 subsurface drip irrigation elmaloglou and diamantopoulos 2009 phogat et al 2017 and crop residue retention wang et al 2011a are common practices research has been shown that maize grown with plastic mulching improved crop growth roots water and nutrient uptake grain yield and water use efficiency gan et al 2013 jia et al 2018 owing to its significant improvement in topsoil water storage and thermal conditions especially in the early growing season gao et al 2017 gong et al 2015 wang et al 2015 the plastic film partially mulched furrow ridge system has been developed and widely applied for crop production in the arid and semiarid loess plateau of china li et al 2001 zhang et al 2019 the ridges mulched by plastic film can harvest light rainfall of 5 mm into the furrows which increases the soil water content and promotes crop growth gan et al 2013 qin et al 2014 increased grain yield water use efficiency and enhanced net profit gong et al 2017 li et al 2013a full plastic mulching with flat cultivation enhanced soil water consumption during the maize growing season and promoted maize production compared with film mulch on the ridge and non mulch furrow due to the increased soil temperature and soil water supply capacity and improved net income wu et al 2017a partial plastic mulching with flat cultivation also produced higher grain yield than that of ck gao et al 2014 on the other hand straw mulching is also an effective practice that reduces evaporation loss from the soil surface protects the soil surface from the direct strike of raindrops enhances soil aggregation promotes biological activity blanco canqu and lal 2009 sharma et al 2011 conserved about 35 of water resources during maize growing period li et al 2013 ab and furrow planting with straw covered ridge performed better synchronization of seasonal soil water supply and crop needs therefore improved maize yield and precipitation use efficiency in henan china wang et al 2011b maize grown under the full film mulching systems had significantly greater root weight density root length density and root diameter gao et al 2014 root length density and root area density were significantly higher under the plastic film and biodegradable film mulch with 430 mm simulated rainfall in the uppermost soil profile layer of 10 50 cm root dry weight was significantly related to the simulated rainfall levels and higher in different growth stages as compared with flat planting jia et al 2018 it was reported that during crop development of maize maize shoot and root growth are closely related to the vertical than to the horizontal axis liedgens and richner 2001 the grain yield of wheat was strongly positively correlated with root weight density in the 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers but negatively correlated with root weight density in the deep soil layers wang et al 2014 even though many studies were conducted to compare the different mulching on the crop growth soil water and temperature root growth grain yield wue and the economic input and output in the loess plateau of china few studies have explored the effect of different mulching practices on root distribution and soil moisture status it is still a lack of scientific study which compared different types of plastic and straw mulching on root distribution in two dimensions 2d to find out the synchronization of soil water transport and root water uptake for maize crop productivity the roots are the primary organ for water and nutrient uptake thus knowledge of root morphology is crucial in optimizing crop production in the rain fed area lynch 2007 the root system is the basis of plant growth due to its absorption of soil moisture and nutrients for the development of the plant which is conducive to high crop growth and yield fageria 2004 by increasing the capacity for root absorption and the interception of water and nutrients crop yield and the water use efficiency can be improved groundwater pollution can also be reduced feddes and raats 2004 palta et al 2007 roots with greater lengths can increase nutrient supply to the plant than those with shorter roots dong et al 1995 increased root length or root diameter can reduce drought stress in crops o toole and soemartono 1981 a larger rooting system developed earlier in the growth period can adapt the crop better to the semiarid environments fageria 2004 therefore knowledge about the temporal and spatial root distribution is vital for understanding the mode of crop and soil environment response to the management practices and it is of great significance to study 2d root distribution and water absorption process at the root soil interface at different growth stages many studies about maize root growth in situ observation had been done by analyzing rooting density distribution in the unit soil strip where root samples were collected using a soil drill or auger gao et al 2014 jia et al 2018 liu et al 2017 root sample collecting by a simple auger sampling method for determining rooting density in the field studies is less laborious and less destructive of experimental site compared with soil monolith excavation method however root sample collecting by this method can be determined only vertical root distribution and a large number of replicate samples and a carefully chosen sampling scheme by auguring are required to obtain reasonably accurate estimates of average rooting density minirhizontrons imaging system mis was also used to observe the relation between maize leaf area and root density liedgens and richner 2001 and maize root development liedgens et al 2000 minirhizotrons provide a non destructive in situ method for viewing roots and recording their growth through sequential photographs amato et al 2012 mis is possible to study root development in the soil profile liedgens et al 2000 root turnover pregitzer et al 2008 without the destruction of experimental site but they have limitations among them a big limitation was a relatively high price 10 000 faget et al 2010 moreover some technical problems and methodological difficulties can also be faced liedgens and richner 2001 furthermore the identification of roots on minirhizotron images may be impaired by soil structure patterns the presence of soil biota as well as limitations of the imaging equipment sampling entire soil volume through monolith excavation can give a precise estimation for average rooting density in the representative quarter or half of unit soil strip even though this method is highly destructive labor intensive and time consuming in sampling monolith excavation method is simple and we can analyze 2d root distribution under different mulching practices therefore we used soil monolith excavation method in the present study and this was closely connected to improve the synchronization of soil water transport and root water uptake for different mulching treatments the main objective of this research was to evaluate the most effective mulching type and practices by comparing spatial and temporal 2d root distribution soil moisture status at different depths across the root zone evaporation and transpiration rate yield and net income of maize the results of this study we believe is of great importance to providing a practical basis and theoretical support for sustainable rain fed maize growing management on the loess plateau of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was carried out at the experimental station of dry land agriculture and environment 37 45 58 n 113 12 9 e an elevation of 1202 m above sea level ministry of agriculture and rural affairs shouyang shanxi province china according to gong et al 2017 the regional climate condition is a typical continental temperate with a mean daily temperature of 7 4 c and an average number of 140 frost free day year 1 the precipitation is concentrated during the summer months from the beginning of june to the end of september with an average annual value of 481 mm in the study area the groundwater table remains at the depth of about 150 m below the ground surface so the upward flow from the root was negligible the soil at the experiment site is defined as silt loam with sand 0 05 2 mm silt 0 002 0 05 mm and clay 0 002 mm accounting for 27 0 67 4 and 5 6 respectively bulk density wilting point and field capacity at 0 160 cm soil depth are 1 43 g cm 3 0 15 cm3 cm 3 and 0 48 cm3 cm 3 respectively total nitrogen total phosphorus total potassium content and organic carbon content at 0 30 cm soil depth were 0 44 0 59 11 77 4 59 g kg 1 and those of 30 60 cm soil depth were 0 49 0 59 12 46 5 10 g kg 1 respectively the soil ph was 8 4 in 0 30 cm soil depth and 8 2 in 30 60 cm soil depth meteorological data were measured at an interval of 30 min by an automatic weather station located in the experimental site and weather data at different growth stages of maize are described in table 1 2 2 experimental design and treatment the treatments included 1 partial plastic film mulching 60 was mulched only on the ridge but did not mulch on the furrow rf 2 100 full plastic film mulching with conventional flat cultivation fpm 3 100 straw mulching with conventional flat cultivation sm 4 partial plastic film mulching with conventional flat cultivation ppm and 5 non mulching with conventional flat cultivation as a control ck with a randomized complete block design fig 1 the experimental period covered two growing seasons of spring maize from may 7 to october 11 2018 and from may 9 to september 30 2019 respectively the plot size for each replicate was 8 1 m length per 8 m wide and three times repeated maize seeds were sown at a spacing of 0 5 m between the rows with a plant to plant spacing of 30 cm as local farmers practice nitrogen phosphorus and potassium fertilizers were applied as a basal dressing with the same rate as the local farmers fields with the content of n p2o5 k2o 276 114 and 60 kg ha 1 in 2018 and 336 144 60 kg ha 1 in 2019 respectively all recommended cultural practices and plant protection operations were followed to raise a healthy crop for plastic mulching treatments the polyethylene plastic film of 6 μm thickness and 80 cm width was used for rf and ppm for fpm the polyethylene plastic film with the same thickness and 140 cm width was used mulching materials were still left on the field during the winter fallow period for straw mulching treatment the rate of about 8 ton ha 1 of maize straw which covered approximately 4 cm thickness was applied one month after sowing for plastic film mulching plots small holes were made in the film to sow seeds and then heaped with a handful of soil each plot was separated by 50 cm wide and 15 cm high soil ridge to prevent surface runoff and interexchange of soil moisture content 2 3 data collection and analysis 2 3 1 soil moisture content at different depths in order to determine soil moisture contents smc soil samples were collected at 10 cm intervals in the top 0 100 cm soil layer and at 20 cm interval in the soil layer below 100 cm soil depth for different treatments soil samples were collected from 0 160 cm soil profile at different growth stages in each replicated plot smc was measured using the gravimetric method and it was converted to volumetric units mm using the measured soil bulk densities of each plot the places of soil profiles in fpm sm and ppm treatments were 1 between the two rows 2 in the middle space between the central line of the two rows and the nearest plant row fig 1b 1c and 1e and that for rf and ppm treatments were 1 between the two rows of mulch surfaces 2 between the two rows of non mulch surface and 3 the plant row line fig 1a and d smc was determined regularly at the experimental period 3 days before sowing 45 75 105 and 135 days after sowing das in both growing seasons 2 3 2 measurements of soil evaporation with microlysimeters microlysimeters ml made of pvc tubes were applied to monitor daily soil evaporation on rainless days with the weighing method for rf and ppm plots the evaporation rate from the mulching surface and non mulching surface were measured for fpm sm and ck treatments assuming the uniform evaporation rate one place for each replicated plot was measured microlysimeter with a height of 15 cm and a diameter of 11 4 cm for the outer tube and 10 1 cm for the inner tube were used the external tube was always kept in the topsoil and its bottom was not capped however the bottom of the internal tube was capped with a plastic film that did not permit the free drainage of water gong et al 2017 liu et al 2002 when installing ml the inner tube was firstly drilled into the undisturbed soil in the installation location to ensure the homogeneity of soil water then the inner tube was digging out as carefully as possible to minimize disturbance to the surrounding soil for plastic mulching and straw mulching plot sealed the hole with another small piece of plastic mulch and straw mulch to sustain original micro meteorology under the mulch and to ensure the integrity of the hydrothermal environment the soil in the internal tube was replaced with undisturbed soil every 3 days or within one day after each rainfall to avoid any divergence from the surrounding soil due to the cessation of root extraction and water exchange with the subsoil the specific time length of replacement was based on the daily changes in soil water content the replacements of soil were performed approximately 40 50 times in each growing season exclusive of rainy days when replacing the soil in the internal tube we pressed it vertically into the topsoil at a similar position dug it out and put it in the external tube soil evaporation equates to the difference between the mass of the internal tube at the beginning and end of one day divided by the internal bottom area of the internal tube the mass of the internal tube was weighed by a rechargeable electronic scale with a resolution of 0 1 g less than 0 1 mm 2 3 3 sap flow rate from july to september 2019 the sap flow rate of maize plants for each treatment was continuously measured using the flow32 1 k sap flow system dynamax houston tx usa to determine the plant transpiration rate of each treatment the heat conduction of energy in the soil has an asymmetric influence on sap temperature the sap temperature might affect the measurement to reduce such influence each gauge of the sap flow system was installed at the second internode of the maize stem by removing the leaf sheaths feng et al 2019 plastic wrap was used before the installation of gauge in order to reduce stem transpiration since constant heating plant by gauges can lead to dryness of plants the uninstallation of measurement and maintenance of the sap flow system were performed about every two weeks and reinstallation of gauges was performed on the other maize plants the sap flow rate was measured every minute and half hourly average data were recorded in a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific logan ut usa only data during daytime 6 00 to 19 00 were collected and nighttime data were set as zero recalculation of missing data was performed by using the excel file with detailed calculation procedures provided by beijing ecotek technology co ltd china the sap flow rate could not be measured in 2018 because some sensors were accidentally broken at the beginning of the measurement and new sensors did not arrive on time for the measurement sap flow g d 1 was scaled up to plant transpiration mm d 1 using the average ground area of each maize plant 2 3 4 root morphology plant roots from each experimental plot were sampled using the soil monolith excavation method gajri et al 1994 at 45 75 105 and 135 das normal corn plant from inner lines of replicate plots was selected soil monoliths 25 cm towards mid row 15 cm along the row 10 cm depth interval were excavated down to 30 80 100 100 cm depth at 45 75 105 and 135 das from each plot for determining horizontal and vertical root distribution in a representative of unit soil strip each monolith was horizontally sectioned in five segments of 5 cm thickness each for ck sm and fpm plots a quarter of a plant fig 2 a and 10 segments of 5 cm thickness for rf and ppm plots 2 quarters half of a plant fig 2b each monolith was put in a plastic sample bag and brought to the laboratory in the experimental station in this laboratory root samples from the soil root mixture soil monolith were selected manually by using forceps and put in the plastic sample bags then the selected root samples were poured into the sieve with 0 15 mm aperture and gently washed the roots with the tap water when the root was clean and visibly free of soil root samples were put again in a sample plastic bag with 25 aqueous ethanol solution v v and at 4 c then those root samples were brought to the laboratory of the institute using a cold closet and stored at 4 c before scanning the stored roots samples were washed again with tap water to remove the remaining soil from the roots rinsed with 10 mm mes koh buffer ph 6 5 to remove biological contaminants roots in different soil monoliths were scanned using a root scanner epson perfection v800 ca usa root morphological measurements were determined such as length cm surface area cm2 through the winrhizo software regents instruments inc quebec city canada root length density rld and root area density rad were calculated by using the following formulas 1 r o o t l e n g t h d e n s i t y r o o t l e n g t h i n d i f f e r e n t s o i l m o n o l i t h s o i l v o l u m e cm cm 3 where soil volume of one

growth stages the mean value of all monolith from the whole soil profile 0 100 cm soil depth for different growth stages was determined moreover the total root biomass trb per plant and the root biomass rb per respective layer was also calculated based on the measured root biomass in each soil monolith at different soil depth by multiplying with 4 for fpm sm and ck and by multiplying with 2 for rf and ppm 2 3 5 yield and yield components to estimate the significance level of grain yield and yield components among the different treatments fresh grain from the non destructive area of 3 m 3

of soil moisture content 3 1 1 soil moisture status at the various crop growth stages in the case of soil moisture content smc at various crop growth stages significant differences were observed under different mulching practices in 2018 fig 3 smc at 45 das was higher than sowing time in 2018 because of 85 2 mm rainfall after sowing smc declined to a minimum at 75 das in 2018 and 105 das in 2019 since continuously absorbing soil moisture for plant growth after 75 das in 2018 smc was gradually increased in all treatments because of large rainfall smc was significantly higher in fpm and sm than that of the other plots from 75 das until before sowing 2019 because of the high infiltration rate and the benefits to reduce soil evaporation however smc continuously decreased throughout the growing season and smc along the soil profile was not significantly different among different mulching plots from 45 das except 105 das whereas sm was significantly the highest smc at 105 das seasonal mean smc of rf fpm sm ppm and ck were 22 7 24 7 24 7 22 3 22 1 respectively in 2018 and 18 3 19 4 19 1 18 3 17 8 in 2019 since the difference in rainfall smc in 2018 was higher than that in 2019 3 1 2 soil moisture status at different depths across the rooting zones different smc in each soil layer at different growth stages in both growing seasons was shown in fig 4 in 2018 at the jointing stage and tasseling stage 45 and 75 das smc was significantly the highest under fpm especially in the upper soil layers 20 60 cm and 0 30 cm at grain filling and maturity stage smc under sm and fpm was significantly the highest in the whole soil profile and followed by the order as rf ppm and ck before sowing 2019 smc under fpm was significantly the highest because of the lowest evaporation rate during the winter fallow period which was followed in the order by sm ppm rf and ck since less rainfall contribution and high extraction rate of soil moisture for plant growth and development smc was gradually low after sowing maize however smc was significantly higher under mulching treatments especially in the top 0 30 cm soil layer from 45 das whereas ck was the highest in the 70 120 cm soil profile at 75 das at the maturity stage the smc of fpm was significantly the highest in 0 30 cm soil depth and ppm was the highest at 100 160 cm soil depth although mean smc of 0 160 cm soil depth was not significantly different at the maturity stage smc of rf fpm sm and ppm was 4 5 9 8 9 9 and 4 0 greater than that of ck 3 2 effect of different mulching practices on soil evaporation evaporation loss during growing periods in 2018 and 2019 was as shown in table 2 rainy days in 2018 were more even than that in 2019 and precipitation amount was also higher in 2018 than that in 2019 consequently the evaporation rate could be measured 79 days in 2018 and 93 days in 2019 during growing seasons because evaporation rate could be measured only in rainless days the evaporation rate was significantly different under different mulching practices in both seasons by comparing the mean evaporation rate at different growth stages of all treatments the lowest evaporation rate was observed in 75 105 das 0 54 mm day 1 in 2018 and 0 45 das 0 33 mm day 1 in 2019 the highest mean evaporation rate of all treatments was observed in 45 75 das in both years with the values of 0 70 mm day 1 in 2018 and 1 00 mm day 1 in 2019 cumulative evaporation rate under rf fpm sm ppm and ck was 45 0 31 2 58 1 50 1 and 69 0 mm respectively in 2018 and 44 4 25 9 56 9 46 3 and 63 8 mm respectively in 2019 by comparing mean value of evaporation rate throughout two growing seasons under different mulching practices ck gave the highest 0 78 mm day 1 which was followed by sm 0 67 mm day 1 ppm 0 57 mm day 1 rf 0 52 mm day 1 and fpm 0 34 mm day 1 showed the lowest evaporation rate compared to ck the evaporation rate of rf fpm sm and ppm showed a lower rate of 32 6 57 0 13 4 and 27 4 respectively 3 3 sapflow fig 5 depicted diurnal variations of sap flow on typical sunny cloudy and rainy days for all treatments on sunny days from july 26 to july 28 at the tasseling stage variations of sap flow were similar trends to each other among the treatments which were mainly depended on the rate of global solar radiation thus sap flow rates were gradually increased to noon after that continuously decreased the average sap flow rate of rf fpm sm ppm and ck were 59 0 64 2 42 0 48 5 and 36 8 g h 1 with average global solar radiation of 242 w m 2 on the cloudy and rainy day of 29 july there was precipitation about 23 8 mm from 10 30 to 15 00 sap flow at 10 30 was suddenly decreased and increased again at noontime because of noontime sunshine then decreased again until the end of the rainfall after rainfall the sap flow rate was increased again and gradually decreased in the afternoon on the rainy day of august 20 there was precipitation about 5 8 mm from 8 00 to 9 30 sap flow in the morning is very low then increased until noon and gradually decreased in the afternoon on the rainy day of july 29 and august 20 hourly sap flow for all treatments showed fluctuated increase decrease trend based on the global solar radiation rate while the mean sap flow rate of rf fpm sm ppm and ck were 8 7 12 4 5 5 6 2 and 5 1 g h 1 72 w m 2 respectively on the cloudy day of 22 august hourly sap flow for all treatments showed fluctuated increase decrease trend depended on the global solar radiation rate while the mean sap flow rate of rf fpm sm ppm and ck were 11 3 16 7 6 8 7 9 and 6 5 g h 1 86 w m 2 respectively on that day it was observed that the sap flow rate was low in the morning because of cloudy and then the sap flow rate was gradually increased until noon and decreased again in the afternoon according to the global solar radiation rate the transpiration rate of different treatments from heading to harvesting was described in fig 6 transpiration amount of rf fpm sm ppm and ck at the heading stage 61 83 das was 72 9 82 5 51 6 58 0 and 43 9 mm while that at grain filling stage 84 125 das was 85 8 105 2 64 3 75 6 and 48 6 mm respectively at the maturity stage 126 144 das rf fpm sm ppm and ck have been recorded the total transpiration rate of 1 2 2 4 1 2 1 4 and 0 9 mm respectively under different weather situations during the measuring period the transpiration rate of fpm was the highest which was followed by rf ppm sm and ck showed the lowest transpiration rate rf fpm sm and ppm improved transpiration rate by 71 103 25 and 44 than that of ck under different weather conditions by comparing mean sap flow rate of all measuring days 3 4 root biomass density and root biomass distribution in two dimensions 2d by comparing 2d root biomass density rbd distribution at different soil monoliths rbd in five different treatments showed a similar pattern across the collected soil depths in each growth stage figs 7 figs 8 it was observed that the majority of the maize roots were situated vertically on the top 0 30 cm soil depth and horizontally 0 15 cm distance from the plant base the root biomass distribution decreased substantially with the soil depth and distance away from the plant base moreover the root growth parameters increased with the maize age until 105 das grain filling stage after that the root growth was substantially decreased by comparing the mean value of total root biomass trb at different growth stages in two years 72 7 82 8 81 0 of the total rb in 2018 and 62 0 59 8 69 3 of trb in 2019 were distributed vertically in 0 30 cm soil depth at 75 das 105 das and 135 das respectively table 3 by horizontally 70 5 80 0 88 6 86 8 of the trb in 2018 and 68 7 76 9 74 3 82 3 of the trb in 2019 were distributed horizontally at 0 15 cm from the plant base at 45 das 75 das 105 das and 135 das respectively table 4 for vertically root biomass rb at different soil depths was highly significantly different among different treatments table 3 in 2018 rb of fpm rf and ppm was significantly higher than that of sm and ck at 45 das rb of fpm was significantly the highest in 0 80 cm soil depth at 75 das in 0 30 cm soil depth at 105 and 135 das respectively rb of sm was also higher than that of ppm and ck in 0 60 cm soil depth at 75 das rb under rf sm and ck was higher than those under fp and ppm in 60 100 cm soil depth at 105 das by comparing the mean rb in the top 30 cm soil depth at all growth stages rb of rf fpm ppm was 39 3 56 3 and 36 8 respectively higher than that under ck in 2018 while rb of sm was almost the same value as ck in 2019 rb of fpm was significantly the highest at 45 das rb was not significantly different at 0 30 cm soil depth at 75 das at 105 das rb of sm and ppm was significantly the highest in 0 100 cm soil depth at 135 das rb of ppm was significantly the highest in 0 30 and 60 100 cm soil depth and that under sm was the highest in 30 60 cm soil depth by comparing the mean rb in the top 30 cm soil depth at all growth stages in 2019 rb of rf fpm sm and ppm was 30 4 47 7 34 6 and 50 3 respectively higher than that of ck by horizontally rb of rf fpm and ppm was significantly higher than that of sm and ck in 0 25 cm from the plant base at 45 das and 0 15 cm from the plant base at 105 and 135 das in 2018 table 4 at 75 das rb of fpm was significantly the highest in 0 15 cm and that of sm was significantly the highest in 15 25 cm from the plant base at 105 das rb of rf and ck was significantly the highest in 15 25 cm from the plant base by comparing the mean rb in 0 15 cm from the plant base at all growth stages in 2018 rb of rf fpm and ppm was 47 6 62 4 and 42 3 respectively higher than that under ck sm was slightly higher 6 4 than that of ck in 2019 root biomass of fpm was significantly the highest in 0 15 cm from plant base at 45 das and 75 das while at 105 and 135 das rb of ppm was significantly the highest in 0 15 cm horizontally rb of sm at 45 das rb of rf sm ck at 75 das rb of ck in 135 das respectively were significantly the highest in 15 25 cm distance from the plant base by comparing the mean rb in 0 15 cm from the plant s base at all growth stages in 2019 rb of rf fpm sm and ppm was 29 0 41 5 27 5 and 51 3 respectively higher than that of ck 3 5 root morphology changes at various crop growth stages under different treatments 3 5 1 root biomass density rbd and root biomass rb root biomass density rbd and root biomass rb of maize was significantly influenced by different mulching treatments fig 9 tables 3 4 at 45 105 and 135 das in 2018 rbd of plastic mulching treatments was significantly higher than that of sm and ck rbd of sm was 83 5 92 6 and 92 0 lower rbd of ck was 34 3 40 9 and 40 5 lower than that of rf fpm and ppm at 45 das respectively at 75 das rbd of fpm was significantly the highest and that of ck was significantly the lowest by comparing maximum rbd in 2018 rf was 27 1 fpm was 24 5 ppm was 24 6 higher and sm was 0 54 lower than that of ck in 2019 rbd of fpm was significantly the highest at 45 das and was 25 9 29 0 17 0 and 48 0 respectively higher than that of rf sm ppm and ck however rbd was not significantly different among different mulching treatments at 75 das in 2019 rbd of ppm and sm was significantly the highest at 105 das at 135 das rbd of ppm was significantly the highest by comparing maximum rbd in 2019 rbd of rf fpm sm and ppm was 1 6 8 5 22 4 and 23 4 respectively greater than that of ck in both growing seasons rb of plastic mulching treatments was higher than that of ck especially in the top 30 cm soil depth table 3 and 0 15 cm distance from the plant base table 4 sm was also higher in rbd than that of ck in 2019 3 5 2 root length density rld among the five treatments evaluated in this study fpm had the highest rld in 2018 however rf ppm and sm also showed significantly higher than that of ck at 105 and 135 das fig 9 by comparing maximum rld rld under rf fpm sm and ppm were 35 0 38 6 20 5 and 31 9 respectively higher than that of the ck in 2019 rld of fpm was significantly the highest at only 45 das and was 47 1 28 2 34 9 and 47 9 higher than that of rf sm ppm and ck at 75 105 and 135 das rld of sm was significantly the highest and that under fpm and ck was the lowest rld the maximum root length density of sm was 31 4 46 2 30 3 and 47 1 higher than that of rf fpm ppm and ck respectively 3 5 3 root area density rad root area density was also significantly different at all growth stages in both seasons fig 9 at 45 das sm was significantly the lowest in rad which was only 0 49 0 44 0 42 and 0 51 times compared with rf fpm ppm and ck respectively by comparing maximum rad rf fpm sm and ppm were 24 8 39 0 21 0 and 11 2 higher than that of the ck in 2018 in 2019 rad of fpm was significantly the highest at 45 das which was 33 9 23 8 27 1 and 38 2 higher than that of rf sm ppm and ck sm got the highest rad as compared with other treatments at 75 das 105 das and 135 das the maximum rad of sm was 24 8 26 0 19 2 and 29 7 higher than that of rf fpm ppm and ck respectively 3 6 root to shoot ratio the root to shoot ratio r s is a parameter that evaluates the distribution of dry matter between roots and shoots the value was the highest during the early growth stages then steadily declined throughout the entire growing period and reaching a minimum value at maturity fig 10 the maximum r s values were obtained at the jointing stage 45 das in both years ranging from 0 171 to 0 224 in 2018 and from 0 130 to 0 191 in 2019 among the different treatments compared with the jointing stage the mean value of r s for all treatments at tasseling 75 das grain filling 105 das and maturity 135 das stages were 54 8 80 1 and 87 7 respectively lower in 2018 and 53 3 70 4 and 85 5 respectively lower in 2019 which indicated that relatively rapid growth and dry matter accumulation in the above ground parts of the plant occur during the middle and later stages of spring maize development the r s was significantly higher under ck at 45 das in 2018 growing season while ck was 18 1 23 7 16 6 and 19 3 higher than that of rf fpm sm and ppm respectively in 2019 r s under ck and sm was significantly the highest at 45 das and 75 das because of their low rate of shoot development while at grain filling stage r s under sm and ppm was significantly the highest because of their high growth rate of root due to higher soil moisture content in deeper soil depth than the other treatments r s under ck was 31 6 29 2 11 0 33 6 at 45 das and 21 8 33 8 13 2 28 4 at 75 das respectively higher than that under rf fpm sm and ppm in 2019 r s under sm was 23 2 20 4 25 4 and 9 8 23 7 17 5 higher than that under rf fpm and ppm at 45 das and 75 das respectively in 2019 by comparing the root to shoot ratio at grain filling stage and maturity stage in 2019 rf and fpm was significantly lower than that of sm ppm and ck r s of rf was 21 5 24 7 20 7 respectively lower and that of fpm was 13 0 16 0 12 2 respectively lower than that of sm ppm and ck 3 7 yield and its components of maize under different mulching practices yield and its components of maize under different mulching treatments were described in table 5 the two seasons mean maize grain yield and biomass yield for each treatment were ranked as fpm rf ppm sm ck higher grain yield was recognized in all plastic mulching treatments than sm and ck in both years sm was also higher than ck but not obvious grain yield of rf fpm and ppm were recorded 1634 kg ha 1 16 9 1638 kg ha 1 16 9 and 572 kg ha 1 5 9 higher in 2018 and 1418 kg ha 1 18 6 3372 kg ha 1 44 1 and 807 kg ha 1 10 6 higher in 2019 than that of ck sm produced very slightly higher grain yield in 2018 and 682 kg ha 1 8 9 higher grain yield in 2019 than that of ck the two seasons mean biomass yield under rf fpm sm and ppm were significantly increased by 2690 kg ha 1 12 5 4456 kg ha 1 20 8 kg ha 1 1097 kg ha 1 5 1 and 1738 kg ha 1 8 1 respectively than that of ck the value of kernels cob in 2018 ranged from 602 to 640 and it ranged from 575 to 730 in 2019 the 100 kernels weight ranged from 38 92 to 41 73 g in 2018 and it ranged from 30 03 to 32 53 g in 2019 the biomass ranged from 24 233 to 26 848 kg ha in 2018 and it ranged from 18 655 to 24 951 in 2019 kg ha among different treatments indicating 100 kernels weight and biomass in 2018 was higher and the kernels cob was lower than that in 2019 the value of hi was significantly the highest under rf in 2018 and that under fpm was significantly the highest in 2019 even though grain yield and biomass yield was higher in 2018 than that in 2019 hi value was not much different by comparing two seasons hi was the highest under fpm by comparing the mean value of two years results shelling percentage was significantly the lowest under ck in both years the mentioned yield components were also higher in mulching treatments than that of ck in both growing seasons generally yield components under fpm were the highest because of its highest plant and root growth from the early growth stage the three yield components ears plant kernels cob and 100 kernels weight decided the final yield ears plant was significantly the highest under rf and ppm in 2018 and that under fpm was the highest in 2019 there was no significant difference in kernels cob under rf fpm ppm and ck in 2018 therefore the higher yield under rf fpm and ppm in 2018 was because of the greater ears and 100 kernels weight however there was no significant difference in ears plant and 100 kernels weight under rf and ck in 2019 therefore the increased yield under rf in 2019 was due to the higher kernels cobs 3 8 relationship between yield and root parameters the results showed that rbd measured at 45 75 105 das and rad measured at 135 das were highly significantly p 0 01 correlated with grain yield and rbd and rld measured at 135 das rad measured at 105 das were also significantly p 0 05 correlated with grain yield in 2018 table 6 there was a positive relationship between maize grain yield and root development in 2018 in 2019 rbd at 45 das p 0 01 and rad at 45 das p 0 05 were significantly correlated with grain yield rld at 45 das and rbd at 75 and 135 das were positively correlated with grain yield however rad and rld at 75 105 135 das and rbd at 105 das were negatively correlated with grain yield rb at 0 30 cm soil depth in each growth stage was positively or significantly correlated with grain yield in both growing seasons table 7 r s was negatively correlated with grain yield at 45 and 75 das in 2018 and positively correlated with grain yield in 105 and 135 das in 2019 r s was negatively correlated with grain yield at all growth stages table 6 determining the relationship between rb at different soil depth rb at 0 30 cm soil depth at all growth stage was positively or significantly correlated with grain yield in both growing seasons table 7 rb in 30 100 cm soil depth at 105 das in both seasons and rb in 30 60 cm depth at 75 das and 135 das in 2019 was negatively correlated with grain yield the relationship between horizontal root biomass distribution and grain yield resulted that root biomass at 0 15 cm distance away from plant base at all growth stages in 2018 45 das and 75 p 0 01 das in 2019 were significantly correlated with grain yield table 8 root biomass at 15 25 cm away from plant base at 75 das in 2018 and 45 das in 2019 was positively correlated with grain yield root biomass at 15 25 cm away from plant base at 45 105 and 135 das in 2018 75 105 and 135 das in 2019 were negatively correlated with grain yield 3 9 relation between rainfall and root parameter simple correlation analysis between rainfall and root biomass density root length density root area density and root to shoot ratio of 2018 and 2019 was mentioned in table 9 the result indicated that rbd and rad measured at all growth stages were significantly or positively correlated with rainfall however rld at 75 105 and 135 das was negatively correlated with rainfall r s was significantly p 0 05 correlated with rainfall at 45 and 75 das however negatively correlated with rainfall at 105 das and positively correlated with rainfall at 135 das 3 10 economic benefit the use of mulching materials and labor caused the obvious differences in the input costs of the various treatments table 10 in both years the total input cost under different mulching treatments followed the order rf sm fpm ppm ck the total output value was ranked as follows fpm rf ppm sm ck which was similar to the grain yield order net income and output input ratio with fpm were the highest and net income was increased by 2044 cny ha 1 in 2018 and 5294 cny ha 1 in 2019 respectively compared with ck the output value of sm was slightly higher than that of ck however the net income was lower than ck in 2018 because of the higher labor cost for manually spreading maize straw 4 discussion 4 1 effect of mulching practices on soil moisture dynamics water shortage is the major constraint for crop growth and production in arid and semiarid regions and water retained in the topsoil is easily lost by evaporation li et al 2013b 2017 mulching with plastic gravel and straw prevented water evaporation from soil surfaces to the atmosphere and increased crop transpiration li et al 2013a zhang et al 2020 in the present study smc under mulching treatments was significantly higher than that under ck plot in 2018 and before sowing 2019 but not significantly different in the growing period of 2019 because of insufficient rain smc under fpm was consistently higher in the upper 0 30 cm soil layer during growing periods and throughout the soil profile in the plenteous rainfall this was mainly because plastic film mulching kept topsoil water content relatively stable by inhibiting evaporation from the soil surface zhou et al 2009 and moreover it enabled the movement of water from the deeper soil layers to the topsoil by capillary action and vapor transfer li et al 1999 tian et al 2003 a similar result was reported by gao et al 2014 who compared smc under different plastic mulching smc under full plastic mulching with double ridge furrow system was the highest which was followed by rf ppm and ck showed the lowest smc in the study of different straw mulching by wang et al 2011b sm showed 10 4 higher smc compared with ck due to the rate of water vapor flux through a mulched straw was generally slow compared that from a moist soil surface li et al 2013b smc of rf and ppm was observed not significantly higher than that of ck especially in the early growth stages this may be because of higher crop transpiration rates during the early growth stage compared with ck that led to low soil moisture content but rather promoted growth with associated greater plant transpiration li et al 1999 li et al 2013b soil moisture under sm was higher than that of rf ppm and even sometimes fpm in some growth stages in the present study in two growing seasons comparing straw mulch with plastic mulch soil moisture content depended not only on types of mulching materials but also based on system such as depth type and size for straw mulch and for plastic full or partial with ridge and furrow partial with flat cultivation or partial with double ridge and furrow and so on moreover smc based on the growth and development of crops their extraction rate of soil moisture and the amount of rainfall distribution in the finding of our research work fpm and sm helped channel rainfall to the maize root zones effectively and efficiently sm also retained soil moisture almost similar to fpm especially in crop growing period however the yield of sm was not as high as plastic mulching treatments due to the less efficient water use rf and ppm also channeled rainwater to the maize root zones however some part of the rainwater might have flown to the uncovered strips of the land area with less rainwater channeling to the root zones compared with fpm and sm by comparing rf and ppm retaining smc amount was almost the same however plant growth and yield were lower under ppm the flat planting without mulching was the poorest in harvesting rainfall leading to rapid evaporation of rainwater and therefore the lowest in smc 4 2 effect of mulching practices on evaporation water loss from evaporation is a serious constraint in flat dryland areas similar to a runoff because the evaporation rate was almost one third of total water receiving in the non mulch plot 24 5 under wheat straw mulch and 6 3 under plastic mulch plot li et al 2013b the evaporation rate of rf and ppm was higher than that of fpm because partial plastic mulching did not effective in decreasing soil moisture loss through surface evaporation from the non mulch area under fpm evaporation can normally occur only from the small gaps along some edges and the destruction area about 0 5 5 of the total surface area by weed wind farmers activities and seed hole wu et al 2017b in this study the soil evaporation rate under plastic mulching was significantly lower compared with the sm and ck the evaporation rate of sm was also significantly lower than that of ck the same result was recorded by li et al 2013b the lower evaporation rate of sm than that of ck was mainly because straw mulch reduced the quantity of direct solar radiation reaching the soil surface which reduced the amount of energy available for changing water from a liquid to a gas and mulch itself acted as an insulator for the downward conduction of heat into the soil phillips 1983 unger et al 2012 therefore water in a deep layer of soil was difficult to change into vapor and escaped from the soil surface in our experiment the evaporation rate of rf fpm sm and ppm was 32 6 57 0 13 4 and 27 4 respectively lower than that of the ck by comparing the mean value of two growing seasons by comparing the mean value of evaporation loss under all treatments at different growth stages the highest evaporation rate was recorded in 45 75 das jointing to tasseling stage in both years because more moist soil surface high temperature as well as lower canopy caused high evaporation rate the lowest evaporation rate was recorded in 75 105 das tasseling to grain filling stage in 2018 because the plant was at the maximum growth stage the plant canopy reduced the evaporation rate of the soil since shading by the canopy accounted for at least three fourths of the evaporation reduction todd et al 1991 in 2019 the lowest evaporation rate was recorded at 0 45 das seedling to the jointing stage because a dry surface due to absence of rainfall for about 25 consecutive days and low soil temperature reduced evaporation comparing the evaporation rate of rf and ppm the evaporation rate under rf was significantly lower than that of ppm 10 1 in 2018 because rf had the larger plant growth than that of ppm in 2018 however there was slightly lower 4 1 in dryer year in 2019 since the plant growth was not much different in 2018 even though the total number of days measured for the evaporation rate was lower than that of 2019 the evaporation rate of 2018 was higher than that of 2019 since the precipitation rate of 2018 was higher and more even as a result the evaporation rate from moist soil surface was higher 4 3 effect of mulching practices on transpiration mulching enhanced water flux exchange between maize plants and atmosphere thus increased transpiration rate and resulting in higher maize root water uptake and more sap flow going through the maize stem feng et al 2019 our results indicated that the transpiration rate of fpm was the highest which was followed by rf ppm sm and ck showed the lowest at all growth stages transpiration rate of rf fpm sm and ppm was 71 102 25 and 44 higher than that of the ck plot during the measuring period a similar result was observed by feng et al 2019 and gong et al 2017 who reported that plastic mulching obviously improved sap flow as compared with ck treatment heading and the grain filling stages are the highest plant growth and maximum water consumption stages in this study heading stage got the highest transpiration rate among the three growth stages however gong et al 2017 study indicated grain filling stage achieved the highest transpiration rate the highest transpiration at heading stages in this study was because of more rainfall occurred in this stage the lowest transpiration at the maturity stage was because of the crop mature and soil dryness 4 4 effect of mulching practices on root distribution the distribution of roots in soil profiles is important in determining water and nutrient uptake since the root system directly affects the growth of the above ground parts and grain yield liu et al 2009 2017 many researchers have been reported that different plastic and straw mulching practices have increased moisture in the topsoil and soil temperature wu et al 2017a zhou et al 2009 promoted stand establishment and plant growth gao et al 2017 li et al 2017 finally improved grain yield liu et al 2014 since mulching probably improved soil structure dong et al 2018 and enhanced nutrient cycling in the soil fang et al 2011 maize in the full film with double ridge and furrow mulching systems had significantly greater root growth parameters compared to half film mulching and non mulched plot gao et al 2014 rld and rad were significantly higher under plastic film mulch and biodegradable film mulch as compared with flat planting jia et al 2018 mulching increased maize root dry weight and length in the 0 20 cm soil layer and root activity at maturity niu et al 2020 however there was a lack of scientific information that mentioned how different types of plastic mulching and straw mulching would affect 2d maize crop root growth and distribution across the rooting zone in the present study we measured the detailed root growth patterns by vertically and horizontally using soil monolith excavation method across the rooting zone under different film mulching and straw mulching therefore the findings of the current research work will fill the gap of how mulching improves the synchronization of soil water transport and root water uptake for maize crop the global average distribution of root mass for all biomes and vegetation types was 50 in the upper 0 2 m and 75 in the upper 0 4 m gregory 2006 most of the root of the annual crop is located in the 0 20 cm soil depth fageria 2012 in oilseed and legume crops without film mulch about 80 of root dry weight was in the soil layer above 40 cm liu et al 2012 our data also showed consistently in both years that the majority of the maize roots were situated in the top 30 cm soil depth and 0 15 cm from the plant base under all treatments and generally the root weight density decreased substantially with the soil depth and away from the plant base mulching does not alter the root distribution across the root zones and root growth patterns are similar under all treatments in both seasons root biomass density rbd is the most essential parameters used for root characteristics evaluation jia et al 2018 in this study plastic mulching treatments were higher in root biomass density compared with ck and sm in both seasons especially in the 0 30 cm soil depth since soil water and nutrient in this soil horizon might be more favorable for the growth of maize root qi et al 2012 thus the maize grain yield was positively correlated with rbd in the top 0 30 cm soil depth a similar result was observed in jia et al 2018 niu et al 2020 and wang et al 2014 who reported that grain yield was strongly positively correlated with rbd in the top soil layers rbd under fpm was significantly the highest in 2018 however slightly higher in the 0 30 cm than that of ck and not as high as ppm and sm after 75 das in 2019 because drought stress reduces the accumulation of nitrogen and phosphorus in roots and restricts root growth and distribution in the soil gajri et al 1989 although the total root biomass reduces during drought water deficits may increase the proportion of roots in deep soil layers which favors water and nutrient absorption under stress conditions coelho and or 1999 therefore rbd below 30 cm soil depth was greater in 2019 than that in 2018 however total root biomass in 2019 was lower than that in 2018 rbd of ppm and sm was higher than that under fpm below 30 cm soil depth at grain filling stage as shown in table 3 while the yield in ppm and sm was lower than that in fpm indicating more biomass distributed in the root system was not conducive to yield improvement because root biomass was negatively correlated with grain yield under drought year or at grain filling stage the higher the plant growth and the grain yield the lower the root biomass in deep soil layer at grain filling stage was observed in this study root biomass was negatively correlated with grain yield in 30 100 cm soil depth at 105 das in both seasons and 30 60 cm soil depth at 75 das and 135 das in 2019 as shown in table 7 the same result was observed by wang et al 2014 who indicated that more biomass distributed in the root system only the uppermost 0 20 cm soil layers was conducive to yield improvement this was mainly because under water stress condition or grain filling stage absorption of water and nutrient of crop favors mainly for plant growth and grain filling than root growth the previous study has shown that root growth was consistently higher under plastic film mulching on the ridge and non mulch furrow treatment than that of biodegradable film mulch soil crust mulch and traditional flat planting in both growing seasons because the rainfall amount was simulated with 430 mm in both year jia et al 2018 root length is a better parameter of root growth to correlate with the absorption of water and nutrients since high root length is linked to a short travel distance of water and solutes andrews and newman 1970 root length density and rooting depth for brassica napus kirkegaard et al 1997 and pisum sativum liu et al 2012 were highly related to water availability in the findings of our research in 2019 the plants continuously exploited soil moisture for plant growth and when the upper soil moisture was exhausted the root needs to prolong to extract soil moisture from the lower soil layer especially after 75 das in 2019 consequently the distribution of root in the lower soil layer was higher in 2019 than that of 2018 rld and rad were significantly the highest under fpm in 2018 however rld and rad were significantly the highest under sm and ppm in 2019 after 45 das since smc in the lower soil layer of these treatments were higher in 2019 root length as well as root weight has a positive correlation with grain yield however root dry weight has a higher correlation with grain yield compared with maximum root length fageria 2012 furthermore it was reported that root weight density root length density root diameter and root volume density in legumes were positively related to soil water availability liu et al 2012 in the present study generally there was a positive relationship between maize grain yield and root growth parameters rld rad and rbd under rainy year and negative correlation with grain yield under drought year table 6 by comparing the relation between grain yield and 2d root biomass distribution root biomass in the top 0 30 soil depth and the nearest plant base 0 15 cm was significantly or positively correlated with grain yield table 7 8 under sufficient soil moisture however under insufficient soil moisture conditions and grain filling stage 105 das there was negative correlation between grain yield and root biomass at 30 100 cm soil depth and 15 25 cm distance from the plant base the improvement of grain yield is closely related to the dry matter distribution ratio between above ground parts and the root system because roots and shoots organically constitute the entire functional system of a crop then assimilate consumed by the roots is twice than that of the shoots passioura 1983 thus crops with lower r s ratios which partition more dry matter to above ground biomass will achieve higher wue and grain yields ma et al 2010 zhang et al 2009 however after anthesis the amount of assimilates translocated to the root system is very small and the net size of the root system hardly increases and even declines as the roots die gregory 1994 r s in this study was negatively correlated with grain yield in both growing seasons except 105 and 135 das in 2018 because plants could utilize nutrients and water sufficiently not only for shoot development but also for root growth in the present study maximum r s was observed at 45 das in both years and gradually decreased until maturity r s under ck and sm at 45 and 75 das was higher than plastic mulching because of the lower shoot growth compared with rf fpm and ppm r s under ppm sm and ck at 105 das in 2019 was significantly higher than that of rf and fpm because root biomass of ppm sm and ck were higher and shoot biomass was lower than that of rf and fpm 4 5 effect of mulching practices on yield crop yield is the economic part of the plant used for humans and animals consumption and it reflects the management system and soil productivity in the present study significant differences in grain yield were observed among different cultivation systems higher yield and yield components were obtained under mulching treatments in this study among the five mulching treatments maize yield under fpm was significantly the highest and that of rf was the second highest maize yield under fpm and rf was 16 9 16 9 and was 44 1 18 6 higher than under ck in 2018 and in 2009 respectively ppm and sm also produced slightly higher maize grain yield than that of ck some related studies have demonstrated that rf fpm sm and ppm were significantly increased maize biomass and grain yield dong et al 2018 gao et al 2014 2019 gong et al 2017 li et al 2001 2013a li et al 2017 wang et al 2011b although different results from mulching technologies were observed between the current research and other investigations the mulching effects on increasing maize yields were consistent this was probably because of high infiltration rate of rainwater into the soil liu et al 2014 reducing soil water loss through surface evaporation li et al 2013b as a consequence increased soil moisture storage enhanced transpiration rate feng et al 2019 promoted the growth of the root gao et al 2014 improved root water uptake and stomata behavior gao et al 2014 ramakrishna et al 2006 these improvements resulted in more plant assimilation biomass accumulation and finally improved grain yields under mulching plots gong et al 2015 among mulching practices maize yield under plastic mulching plots was significantly the highest since plastic mulching promoted crop growth better than sm and ck from the early growth stages wang et al 2015 the photosynthetic rate was higher and more co2 was assimilated in maize under plastic mulching plots because of a significant correlation between green leaf area index photosynthetically active radiation temperature soil water content and root water transport gao et al 2017 gong et al 2015 maize yield under fpm was significantly the highest since the highest early growth rate by comparing rf and ppm even though ppm retained smc similar the sap flow rate of maize under rf was higher therefore the assimilation rate was higher and plant growth and yield were higher under rf than that under ppm biomass yield and 100 kernels weight in 2018 was higher and the kernels cob was lower than that in 2019 this was mainly because of the different varieties in 2018 the variety ningyu 524 was sown and the variety qiangsheng 999 was sown in 2019 moreover precipitation amount was lower in 2019 that also affected the biomass weight and 100 kernels weight even though grain yield and biomass yield was higher in 2018 than that in 2019 hi value was not much different by comparing two seasons this might be because of dry matter mobilization efficiency dmme the previous study reported that the grain filling of well watered treatments lasted less than that of the less watered treatments resulting lower hi and dmme and the yield potential of the well watered treatments was restricted under this condition zhang et al 2008 in this study there was much rainfall in grain filling stage in 2018 it might cause shorter to grain filling duration of maize and caused the reduction in biomass transferred to kernels that could not achieve the potential grain production and effect lower hi on the other hand it was reported that moderate water deficit during grain filling increased mobilization of assimilate stored in vegetative tissues to grains resulting in greater grain yield and wue zhang et al 2008 in 2019 maize plant might suffer moderate water deficit and could get the yield potential under its current situation therefore both grain yield and biological yield in 2019 were lower than that in 2018 however hi value was not much different determining labor cost during land preparing after plowing crop residue as well as plastic mulch and straw mulch residue were removed together before sowing maize therefore labor usage for removing residue was almost the same for all treatments the labor cost of rf was higher than that of fpm and ppm to do ridge and furrow mulching with maize straw by manually was also laborious therefore labor cost for straw mulching was the highest even though the cost for plastic mulching of fpm was the highest weed could not be grown well under fpm thus it had lower total input cost compared with rf and sm in both years the total input cost under different treatments followed the order rf sm fpm ppm ck the total output value was ranked as follows fpm rf ppm sm ck which was a similar order as the grain yield table 10 therefore the net income of fpm was the highest among different mulching treatments by comparing the net income of two years the net income of rf fpm and ppm was increased by 1492 3669 and 506 cny ha 1 while net income of sm was decreased by 273 cny ha 1 compared with ck 5 conclusion this study indicated how different mulching systems performed differently in synchronization of seasonal soil water transport and root water absorption process at the root soil interface the majority of the maize root 80 were distributed in vertically 30 cm soil depth and for horizontally 70 85 0 15 cm from the plant base under rainy year however under drought year more plant root extended to both horizontal and vertical sites to exploit soil moisture and about 65 of maize root were distributed in the top 30 cm soil depth therefore root length was negatively correlated with rainfall grain yield was positively correlated with rbd in the entire soil profile under rainy year while negatively correlated with rbd in the deep 30 100 cm soil depth and 15 25 cm away from the plant base under insufficient soil moisture and at grain filling stage all the mulching practices produced a higher grain yield than that of ck among them fpm contributed the highest grain yield and was 16 9 in 2018 and 44 1 in 2019 higher than that of ck in fpm the large yield was correlated with the improved root systems particularly on the top 30 cm soil depth due to increased soil water content especially in top 30 cm soil depth although maize plants in the various mulching systems showed a similar root distribution pattern across the soil profile root biomass under fpm was significantly the highest which was 40 9 and 48 0 higher while r s under fpm was 27 9 and 41 2 lower than that of ck at 45 das in 2018 and 2019 indicating that shoot growth was also obviously increased from the early growth stage because of significantly improved soil moisture content and early vigorous of the root and shoot the evaporation rate was reduced the sap flow rate was promoted and grain yield was higher under plastic mulching treatments among plastic mulching treatments fpm produced the highest grain yield which was followed the order by rf and ppm sm also produced a slightly higher grain yield than that of ck full plastic mulching showed the best synchronization of soil water transport and root water uptake therefore it is concluded that fpm could be an effective sustainable system for maize production in this study region and this method will bring an increased in income of the maize farmers however it is needed to consider the environmental problem white

10507,knowledge of root systems and soil water status across the root zone is crucial in developing effective cropping technologies mulching improves soil water status and root water transport for increasing grain yield therefore a field experiment with five treatments 1 plastic film mulching ridge and non mulching furrow rf 2 full plastic mulching with conventional flat cultivation fpm 3 straw mulching with conventional flat cultivation sm 4 partial plastic mulching with conventional flat cultivation ppm and 5 non mulch with conventional flat cultivation ck was conducted during 2018 and 2019 in the eastern loess plateau of china the total root biomass and the grain yield of all treatments were lower in 2019 than that of 2018 because of lower rainfall however all the mulching treatments improved root growth in both growing seasons mainly on the top 30 cm soil depth which led to a distinct effect on grain yield as compared with ck fpm produced the highest total root parameters in 2018 and at 45 das in 2019 due to the highest soil moisture content mainly in 0 30 cm soil depth however root biomass of fpm in 30 100 cm soil depth was lower than that of ppm rf and sm because assimilate at reproductive stage was mostly for plant and seed growth than root growth thus there was negative correlation between grain yield and root biomass below 30 cm soil depth especially at grain filling stage over two growing seasons soil moisture content smc under fpm was 8 4 0 6 8 8 and 11 1 more than that of rf sm ppm and ck fpm reduced soil evaporation improved smc root distribution and transpiration rate consequently increased grain yield and net profit therefore fpm is an effective cropping system for improving the synchronization of soil water transport and root water uptake for maize production in rain fed farming keywords mulching soil moisture content root growth sap flow maize yield loess plateau 1 introduction many studies indicated that climate change may aggravate the risk of drought and reduce agricultural production in arid and semi arid areas thus it is a key issue to emphasize improving crop yields with fewer water resources lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 misra 2014 to mitigating water shortage and reducing environmental problems the loess plateau in northwest china covers an area of 623 800 km2 and has a population of about 90 million the annual precipitation in this region is ranging from 150 300 mm in the north to 500 700 mm in the south and its climate is mostly semi arid li and xiao 1992 most of the cropland on the loess plateau is dryland rain fed farming and water scarcity is the primary limiting factors for agriculture in this region liu et al 2010 to increase the water use efficiency by inhibiting unproductive water loss by adopting alternative field management practices is one of the main objectives for innovating agricultural water management mulching practices by using the straw gravel soil crust biodegradable film or plastic film to the soil surface gao et al 2014 jia et al 2018 li et al 2013a maïga yaleu et al 2013 wang et al 2018 subsurface drip irrigation elmaloglou and diamantopoulos 2009 phogat et al 2017 and crop residue retention wang et al 2011a are common practices research has been shown that maize grown with plastic mulching improved crop growth roots water and nutrient uptake grain yield and water use efficiency gan et al 2013 jia et al 2018 owing to its significant improvement in topsoil water storage and thermal conditions especially in the early growing season gao et al 2017 gong et al 2015 wang et al 2015 the plastic film partially mulched furrow ridge system has been developed and widely applied for crop production in the arid and semiarid loess plateau of china li et al 2001 zhang et al 2019 the ridges mulched by plastic film can harvest light rainfall of 5 mm into the furrows which increases the soil water content and promotes crop growth gan et al 2013 qin et al 2014 increased grain yield water use efficiency and enhanced net profit gong et al 2017 li et al 2013a full plastic mulching with flat cultivation enhanced soil water consumption during the maize growing season and promoted maize production compared with film mulch on the ridge and non mulch furrow due to the increased soil temperature and soil water supply capacity and improved net income wu et al 2017a partial plastic mulching with flat cultivation also produced higher grain yield than that of ck gao et al 2014 on the other hand straw mulching is also an effective practice that reduces evaporation loss from the soil surface protects the soil surface from the direct strike of raindrops enhances soil aggregation promotes biological activity blanco canqu and lal 2009 sharma et al 2011 conserved about 35 of water resources during maize growing period li et al 2013 ab and furrow planting with straw covered ridge performed better synchronization of seasonal soil water supply and crop needs therefore improved maize yield and precipitation use efficiency in henan china wang et al 2011b maize grown under the full film mulching systems had significantly greater root weight density root length density and root diameter gao et al 2014 root length density and root area density were significantly higher under the plastic film and biodegradable film mulch with 430 mm simulated rainfall in the uppermost soil profile layer of 10 50 cm root dry weight was significantly related to the simulated rainfall levels and higher in different growth stages as compared with flat planting jia et al 2018 it was reported that during crop development of maize maize shoot and root growth are closely related to the vertical than to the horizontal axis liedgens and richner 2001 the grain yield of wheat was strongly positively correlated with root weight density in the 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers but negatively correlated with root weight density in the deep soil layers wang et al 2014 even though many studies were conducted to compare the different mulching on the crop growth soil water and temperature root growth grain yield wue and the economic input and output in the loess plateau of china few studies have explored the effect of different mulching practices on root distribution and soil moisture status it is still a lack of scientific study which compared different types of plastic and straw mulching on root distribution in two dimensions 2d to find out the synchronization of soil water transport and root water uptake for maize crop productivity the roots are the primary organ for water and nutrient uptake thus knowledge of root morphology is crucial in optimizing crop production in the rain fed area lynch 2007 the root system is the basis of plant growth due to its absorption of soil moisture and nutrients for the development of the plant which is conducive to high crop growth and yield fageria 2004 by increasing the capacity for root absorption and the interception of water and nutrients crop yield and the water use efficiency can be improved groundwater pollution can also be reduced feddes and raats 2004 palta et al 2007 roots with greater lengths can increase nutrient supply to the plant than those with shorter roots dong et al 1995 increased root length or root diameter can reduce drought stress in crops o toole and soemartono 1981 a larger rooting system developed earlier in the growth period can adapt the crop better to the semiarid environments fageria 2004 therefore knowledge about the temporal and spatial root distribution is vital for understanding the mode of crop and soil environment response to the management practices and it is of great significance to study 2d root distribution and water absorption process at the root soil interface at different growth stages many studies about maize root growth in situ observation had been done by analyzing rooting density distribution in the unit soil strip where root samples were collected using a soil drill or auger gao et al 2014 jia et al 2018 liu et al 2017 root sample collecting by a simple auger sampling method for determining rooting density in the field studies is less laborious and less destructive of experimental site compared with soil monolith excavation method however root sample collecting by this method can be determined only vertical root distribution and a large number of replicate samples and a carefully chosen sampling scheme by auguring are required to obtain reasonably accurate estimates of average rooting density minirhizontrons imaging system mis was also used to observe the relation between maize leaf area and root density liedgens and richner 2001 and maize root development liedgens et al 2000 minirhizotrons provide a non destructive in situ method for viewing roots and recording their growth through sequential photographs amato et al 2012 mis is possible to study root development in the soil profile liedgens et al 2000 root turnover pregitzer et al 2008 without the destruction of experimental site but they have limitations among them a big limitation was a relatively high price 10 000 faget et al 2010 moreover some technical problems and methodological difficulties can also be faced liedgens and richner 2001 furthermore the identification of roots on minirhizotron images may be impaired by soil structure patterns the presence of soil biota as well as limitations of the imaging equipment sampling entire soil volume through monolith excavation can give a precise estimation for average rooting density in the representative quarter or half of unit soil strip even though this method is highly destructive labor intensive and time consuming in sampling monolith excavation method is simple and we can analyze 2d root distribution under different mulching practices therefore we used soil monolith excavation method in the present study and this was closely connected to improve the synchronization of soil water transport and root water uptake for different mulching treatments the main objective of this research was to evaluate the most effective mulching type and practices by comparing spatial and temporal 2d root distribution soil moisture status at different depths across the root zone evaporation and transpiration rate yield and net income of maize the results of this study we believe is of great importance to providing a practical basis and theoretical support for sustainable rain fed maize growing management on the loess plateau of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was carried out at the experimental station of dry land agriculture and environment 37 45 58 n 113 12 9 e an elevation of 1202 m above sea level ministry of agriculture and rural affairs shouyang shanxi province china according to gong et al 2017 the regional climate condition is a typical continental temperate with a mean daily temperature of 7 4 c and an average number of 140 frost free day year 1 the precipitation is concentrated during the summer months from the beginning of june to the end of september with an average annual value of 481 mm in the study area the groundwater table remains at the depth of about 150 m below the ground surface so the upward flow from the root was negligible the soil at the experiment site is defined as silt loam with sand 0 05 2 mm silt 0 002 0 05 mm and clay 0 002 mm accounting for 27 0 67 4 and 5 6 respectively bulk density wilting point and field capacity at 0 160 cm soil depth are 1 43 g cm 3 0 15 cm3 cm 3 and 0 48 cm3 cm 3 respectively total nitrogen total phosphorus total potassium content and organic carbon content at 0 30 cm soil depth were 0 44 0 59 11 77 4 59 g kg 1 and those of 30 60 cm soil depth were 0 49 0 59 12 46 5 10 g kg 1 respectively the soil ph was 8 4 in 0 30 cm soil depth and 8 2 in 30 60 cm soil depth meteorological data were measured at an interval of 30 min by an automatic weather station located in the experimental site and weather data at different growth stages of maize are described in table 1 2 2 experimental design and treatment the treatments included 1 partial plastic film mulching 60 was mulched only on the ridge but did not mulch on the furrow rf 2 100 full plastic film mulching with conventional flat cultivation fpm 3 100 straw mulching with conventional flat cultivation sm 4 partial plastic film mulching with conventional flat cultivation ppm and 5 non mulching with conventional flat cultivation as a control ck with a randomized complete block design fig 1 the experimental period covered two growing seasons of spring maize from may 7 to october 11 2018 and from may 9 to september 30 2019 respectively the plot size for each replicate was 8 1 m length per 8 m wide and three times repeated maize seeds were sown at a spacing of 0 5 m between the rows with a plant to plant spacing of 30 cm as local farmers practice nitrogen phosphorus and potassium fertilizers were applied as a basal dressing with the same rate as the local farmers fields with the content of n p2o5 k2o 276 114 and 60 kg ha 1 in 2018 and 336 144 60 kg ha 1 in 2019 respectively all recommended cultural practices and plant protection operations were followed to raise a healthy crop for plastic mulching treatments the polyethylene plastic film of 6 μm thickness and 80 cm width was used for rf and ppm for fpm the polyethylene plastic film with the same thickness and 140 cm width was used mulching materials were still left on the field during the winter fallow period for straw mulching treatment the rate of about 8 ton ha 1 of maize straw which covered approximately 4 cm thickness was applied one month after sowing for plastic film mulching plots small holes were made in the film to sow seeds and then heaped with a handful of soil each plot was separated by 50 cm wide and 15 cm high soil ridge to prevent surface runoff and interexchange of soil moisture content 2 3 data collection and analysis 2 3 1 soil moisture content at different depths in order to determine soil moisture contents smc soil samples were collected at 10 cm intervals in the top 0 100 cm soil layer and at 20 cm interval in the soil layer below 100 cm soil depth for different treatments soil samples were collected from 0 160 cm soil profile at different growth stages in each replicated plot smc was measured using the gravimetric method and it was converted to volumetric units mm using the measured soil bulk densities of each plot the places of soil profiles in fpm sm and ppm treatments were 1 between the two rows 2 in the middle space between the central line of the two rows and the nearest plant row fig 1b 1c and 1e and that for rf and ppm treatments were 1 between the two rows of mulch surfaces 2 between the two rows of non mulch surface and 3 the plant row line fig 1a and d smc was determined regularly at the experimental period 3 days before sowing 45 75 105 and 135 days after sowing das in both growing seasons 2 3 2 measurements of soil evaporation with microlysimeters microlysimeters ml made of pvc tubes were applied to monitor daily soil evaporation on rainless days with the weighing method for rf and ppm plots the evaporation rate from the mulching surface and non mulching surface were measured for fpm sm and ck treatments assuming the uniform evaporation rate one place for each replicated plot was measured microlysimeter with a height of 15 cm and a diameter of 11 4 cm for the outer tube and 10 1 cm for the inner tube were used the external tube was always kept in the topsoil and its bottom was not capped however the bottom of the internal tube was capped with a plastic film that did not permit the free drainage of water gong et al 2017 liu et al 2002 when installing ml the inner tube was firstly drilled into the undisturbed soil in the installation location to ensure the homogeneity of soil water then the inner tube was digging out as carefully as possible to minimize disturbance to the surrounding soil for plastic mulching and straw mulching plot sealed the hole with another small piece of plastic mulch and straw mulch to sustain original micro meteorology under the mulch and to ensure the integrity of the hydrothermal environment the soil in the internal tube was replaced with undisturbed soil every 3 days or within one day after each rainfall to avoid any divergence from the surrounding soil due to the cessation of root extraction and water exchange with the subsoil the specific time length of replacement was based on the daily changes in soil water content the replacements of soil were performed approximately 40 50 times in each growing season exclusive of rainy days when replacing the soil in the internal tube we pressed it vertically into the topsoil at a similar position dug it out and put it in the external tube soil evaporation equates to the difference between the mass of the internal tube at the beginning and end of one day divided by the internal bottom area of the internal tube the mass of the internal tube was weighed by a rechargeable electronic scale with a resolution of 0 1 g less than 0 1 mm 2 3 3 sap flow rate from july to september 2019 the sap flow rate of maize plants for each treatment was continuously measured using the flow32 1 k sap flow system dynamax houston tx usa to determine the plant transpiration rate of each treatment the heat conduction of energy in the soil has an asymmetric influence on sap temperature the sap temperature might affect the measurement to reduce such influence each gauge of the sap flow system was installed at the second internode of the maize stem by removing the leaf sheaths feng et al 2019 plastic wrap was used before the installation of gauge in order to reduce stem transpiration since constant heating plant by gauges can lead to dryness of plants the uninstallation of measurement and maintenance of the sap flow system were performed about every two weeks and reinstallation of gauges was performed on the other maize plants the sap flow rate was measured every minute and half hourly average data were recorded in a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific logan ut usa only data during daytime 6 00 to 19 00 were collected and nighttime data were set as zero recalculation of missing data was performed by using the excel file with detailed calculation procedures provided by beijing ecotek technology co ltd china the sap flow rate could not be measured in 2018 because some sensors were accidentally broken at the beginning of the measurement and new sensors did not arrive on time for the measurement sap flow g d 1 was scaled up to plant transpiration mm d 1 using the average ground area of each maize plant 2 3 4 root morphology plant roots from each experimental plot were sampled using the soil monolith excavation method gajri et al 1994 at 45 75 105 and 135 das normal corn plant from inner lines of replicate plots was selected soil monoliths 25 cm towards mid row 15 cm along the row 10 cm depth interval were excavated down to 30 80 100 100 cm depth at 45 75 105 and 135 das from each plot for determining horizontal and vertical root distribution in a representative of unit soil strip each monolith was horizontally sectioned in five segments of 5 cm thickness each for ck sm and fpm plots a quarter of a plant fig 2 a and 10 segments of 5 cm thickness for rf and ppm plots 2 quarters half of a plant fig 2b each monolith was put in a plastic sample bag and brought to the laboratory in the experimental station in this laboratory root samples from the soil root mixture soil monolith were selected manually by using forceps and put in the plastic sample bags then the selected root samples were poured into the sieve with 0 15 mm aperture and gently washed the roots with the tap water when the root was clean and visibly free of soil root samples were put again in a sample plastic bag with 25 aqueous ethanol solution v v and at 4 c then those root samples were brought to the laboratory of the institute using a cold closet and stored at 4 c before scanning the stored roots samples were washed again with tap water to remove the remaining soil from the roots rinsed with 10 mm mes koh buffer ph 6 5 to remove biological contaminants roots in different soil monoliths were scanned using a root scanner epson perfection v800 ca usa root morphological measurements were determined such as length cm surface area cm2 through the winrhizo software regents instruments inc quebec city canada root length density rld and root area density rad were calculated by using the following formulas 1 r o o t l e n g t h d e n s i t y r o o t l e n g t h i n d i f f e r e n t s o i l m o n o l i t h s o i l v o l u m e cm cm 3 where soil volume of one

to compare 2d root biomass density distribution rbd at different growth stages the observed root mass in each soil core fraction was extrapolated to a unit area by assuming uniform distribution according to liu et al 2017 and ordóñez et al 2018 3 r o o t b i o m a s s d e n s i t y r o o t m a s s i n d i f f e r e n t s o i l m o n o l i t h 10000 15 5 gm 2 where 10 000 is used to convert

growth stages the mean value of all monolith from the whole soil profile 0 100 cm soil depth for different growth stages was determined moreover the total root biomass trb per plant and the root biomass rb per respective layer was also calculated based on the measured root biomass in each soil monolith at different soil depth by multiplying with 4 for fpm sm and ck and by multiplying with 2 for rf and ppm 2 3 5 yield and yield components to estimate the significance level of grain yield and yield components among the different treatments fresh grain from the non destructive area of 3 m 3 m in the middle of each replicate plot was manually sampled harvested and dried for about one month under sunlight grain yield was determined based on 12 5 water content five consecutive plants from the sample area in each plot were selected for the determination of yield components and the collected samples were tagged and labeled separately ears plant 1 kernels cob 1 100 kernels weight biomass

of soil moisture content 3 1 1 soil moisture status at the various crop growth stages in the case of soil moisture content smc at various crop growth stages significant differences were observed under different mulching practices in 2018 fig 3 smc at 45 das was higher than sowing time in 2018 because of 85 2 mm rainfall after sowing smc declined to a minimum at 75 das in 2018 and 105 das in 2019 since continuously absorbing soil moisture for plant growth after 75 das in 2018 smc was gradually increased in all treatments because of large rainfall smc was significantly higher in fpm and sm than that of the other plots from 75 das until before sowing 2019 because of the high infiltration rate and the benefits to reduce soil evaporation however smc continuously decreased throughout the growing season and smc along the soil profile was not significantly different among different mulching plots from 45 das except 105 das whereas sm was significantly the highest smc at 105 das seasonal mean smc of rf fpm sm ppm and ck were 22 7 24 7 24 7 22 3 22 1 respectively in 2018 and 18 3 19 4 19 1 18 3 17 8 in 2019 since the difference in rainfall smc in 2018 was higher than that in 2019 3 1 2 soil moisture status at different depths across the rooting zones different smc in each soil layer at different growth stages in both growing seasons was shown in fig 4 in 2018 at the jointing stage and tasseling stage 45 and 75 das smc was significantly the highest under fpm especially in the upper soil layers 20 60 cm and 0 30 cm at grain filling and maturity stage smc under sm and fpm was significantly the highest in the whole soil profile and followed by the order as rf ppm and ck before sowing 2019 smc under fpm was significantly the highest because of the lowest evaporation rate during the winter fallow period which was followed in the order by sm ppm rf and ck since less rainfall contribution and high extraction rate of soil moisture for plant growth and development smc was gradually low after sowing maize however smc was significantly higher under mulching treatments especially in the top 0 30 cm soil layer from 45 das whereas ck was the highest in the 70 120 cm soil profile at 75 das at the maturity stage the smc of fpm was significantly the highest in 0 30 cm soil depth and ppm was the highest at 100 160 cm soil depth although mean smc of 0 160 cm soil depth was not significantly different at the maturity stage smc of rf fpm sm and ppm was 4 5 9 8 9 9 and 4 0 greater than that of ck 3 2 effect of different mulching practices on soil evaporation evaporation loss during growing periods in 2018 and 2019 was as shown in table 2 rainy days in 2018 were more even than that in 2019 and precipitation amount was also higher in 2018 than that in 2019 consequently the evaporation rate could be measured 79 days in 2018 and 93 days in 2019 during growing seasons because evaporation rate could be measured only in rainless days the evaporation rate was significantly different under different mulching practices in both seasons by comparing the mean evaporation rate at different growth stages of all treatments the lowest evaporation rate was observed in 75 105 das 0 54 mm day 1 in 2018 and 0 45 das 0 33 mm day 1 in 2019 the highest mean evaporation rate of all treatments was observed in 45 75 das in both years with the values of 0 70 mm day 1 in 2018 and 1 00 mm day 1 in 2019 cumulative evaporation rate under rf fpm sm ppm and ck was 45 0 31 2 58 1 50 1 and 69 0 mm respectively in 2018 and 44 4 25 9 56 9 46 3 and 63 8 mm respectively in 2019 by comparing mean value of evaporation rate throughout two growing seasons under different mulching practices ck gave the highest 0 78 mm day 1 which was followed by sm 0 67 mm day 1 ppm 0 57 mm day 1 rf 0 52 mm day 1 and fpm 0 34 mm day 1 showed the lowest evaporation rate compared to ck the evaporation rate of rf fpm sm and ppm showed a lower rate of 32 6 57 0 13 4 and 27 4 respectively 3 3 sapflow fig 5 depicted diurnal variations of sap flow on typical sunny cloudy and rainy days for all treatments on sunny days from july 26 to july 28 at the tasseling stage variations of sap flow were similar trends to each other among the treatments which were mainly depended on the rate of global solar radiation thus sap flow rates were gradually increased to noon after that continuously decreased the average sap flow rate of rf fpm sm ppm and ck were 59 0 64 2 42 0 48 5 and 36 8 g h 1 with average global solar radiation of 242 w m 2 on the cloudy and rainy day of 29 july there was precipitation about 23 8 mm from 10 30 to 15 00 sap flow at 10 30 was suddenly decreased and increased again at noontime because of noontime sunshine then decreased again until the end of the rainfall after rainfall the sap flow rate was increased again and gradually decreased in the afternoon on the rainy day of august 20 there was precipitation about 5 8 mm from 8 00 to 9 30 sap flow in the morning is very low then increased until noon and gradually decreased in the afternoon on the rainy day of july 29 and august 20 hourly sap flow for all treatments showed fluctuated increase decrease trend based on the global solar radiation rate while the mean sap flow rate of rf fpm sm ppm and ck were 8 7 12 4 5 5 6 2 and 5 1 g h 1 72 w m 2 respectively on the cloudy day of 22 august hourly sap flow for all treatments showed fluctuated increase decrease trend depended on the global solar radiation rate while the mean sap flow rate of rf fpm sm ppm and ck were 11 3 16 7 6 8 7 9 and 6 5 g h 1 86 w m 2 respectively on that day it was observed that the sap flow rate was low in the morning because of cloudy and then the sap flow rate was gradually increased until noon and decreased again in the afternoon according to the global solar radiation rate the transpiration rate of different treatments from heading to harvesting was described in fig 6 transpiration amount of rf fpm sm ppm and ck at the heading stage 61 83 das was 72 9 82 5 51 6 58 0 and 43 9 mm while that at grain filling stage 84 125 das was 85 8 105 2 64 3 75 6 and 48 6 mm respectively at the maturity stage 126 144 das rf fpm sm ppm and ck have been recorded the total transpiration rate of 1 2 2 4 1 2 1 4 and 0 9 mm respectively under different weather situations during the measuring period the transpiration rate of fpm was the highest which was followed by rf ppm sm and ck showed the lowest transpiration rate rf fpm sm and ppm improved transpiration rate by 71 103 25 and 44 than that of ck under different weather conditions by comparing mean sap flow rate of all measuring days 3 4 root biomass density and root biomass distribution in two dimensions 2d by comparing 2d root biomass density rbd distribution at different soil monoliths rbd in five different treatments showed a similar pattern across the collected soil depths in each growth stage figs 7 figs 8 it was observed that the majority of the maize roots were situated vertically on the top 0 30 cm soil depth and horizontally 0 15 cm distance from the plant base the root biomass distribution decreased substantially with the soil depth and distance away from the plant base moreover the root growth parameters increased with the maize age until 105 das grain filling stage after that the root growth was substantially decreased by comparing the mean value of total root biomass trb at different growth stages in two years 72 7 82 8 81 0 of the total rb in 2018 and 62 0 59 8 69 3 of trb in 2019 were distributed vertically in 0 30 cm soil depth at 75 das 105 das and 135 das respectively table 3 by horizontally 70 5 80 0 88 6 86 8 of the trb in 2018 and 68 7 76 9 74 3 82 3 of the trb in 2019 were distributed horizontally at 0 15 cm from the plant base at 45 das 75 das 105 das and 135 das respectively table 4 for vertically root biomass rb at different soil depths was highly significantly different among different treatments table 3 in 2018 rb of fpm rf and ppm was significantly higher than that of sm and ck at 45 das rb of fpm was significantly the highest in 0 80 cm soil depth at 75 das in 0 30 cm soil depth at 105 and 135 das respectively rb of sm was also higher than that of ppm and ck in 0 60 cm soil depth at 75 das rb under rf sm and ck was higher than those under fp and ppm in 60 100 cm soil depth at 105 das by comparing the mean rb in the top 30 cm soil depth at all growth stages rb of rf fpm ppm was 39 3 56 3 and 36 8 respectively higher than that under ck in 2018 while rb of sm was almost the same value as ck in 2019 rb of fpm was significantly the highest at 45 das rb was not significantly different at 0 30 cm soil depth at 75 das at 105 das rb of sm and ppm was significantly the highest in 0 100 cm soil depth at 135 das rb of ppm was significantly the highest in 0 30 and 60 100 cm soil depth and that under sm was the highest in 30 60 cm soil depth by comparing the mean rb in the top 30 cm soil depth at all growth stages in 2019 rb of rf fpm sm and ppm was 30 4 47 7 34 6 and 50 3 respectively higher than that of ck by horizontally rb of rf fpm and ppm was significantly higher than that of sm and ck in 0 25 cm from the plant base at 45 das and 0 15 cm from the plant base at 105 and 135 das in 2018 table 4 at 75 das rb of fpm was significantly the highest in 0 15 cm and that of sm was significantly the highest in 15 25 cm from the plant base at 105 das rb of rf and ck was significantly the highest in 15 25 cm from the plant base by comparing the mean rb in 0 15 cm from the plant base at all growth stages in 2018 rb of rf fpm and ppm was 47 6 62 4 and 42 3 respectively higher than that under ck sm was slightly higher 6 4 than that of ck in 2019 root biomass of fpm was significantly the highest in 0 15 cm from plant base at 45 das and 75 das while at 105 and 135 das rb of ppm was significantly the highest in 0 15 cm horizontally rb of sm at 45 das rb of rf sm ck at 75 das rb of ck in 135 das respectively were significantly the highest in 15 25 cm distance from the plant base by comparing the mean rb in 0 15 cm from the plant s base at all growth stages in 2019 rb of rf fpm sm and ppm was 29 0 41 5 27 5 and 51 3 respectively higher than that of ck 3 5 root morphology changes at various crop growth stages under different treatments 3 5 1 root biomass density rbd and root biomass rb root biomass density rbd and root biomass rb of maize was significantly influenced by different mulching treatments fig 9 tables 3 4 at 45 105 and 135 das in 2018 rbd of plastic mulching treatments was significantly higher than that of sm and ck rbd of sm was 83 5 92 6 and 92 0 lower rbd of ck was 34 3 40 9 and 40 5 lower than that of rf fpm and ppm at 45 das respectively at 75 das rbd of fpm was significantly the highest and that of ck was significantly the lowest by comparing maximum rbd in 2018 rf was 27 1 fpm was 24 5 ppm was 24 6 higher and sm was 0 54 lower than that of ck in 2019 rbd of fpm was significantly the highest at 45 das and was 25 9 29 0 17 0 and 48 0 respectively higher than that of rf sm ppm and ck however rbd was not significantly different among different mulching treatments at 75 das in 2019 rbd of ppm and sm was significantly the highest at 105 das at 135 das rbd of ppm was significantly the highest by comparing maximum rbd in 2019 rbd of rf fpm sm and ppm was 1 6 8 5 22 4 and 23 4 respectively greater than that of ck in both growing seasons rb of plastic mulching treatments was higher than that of ck especially in the top 30 cm soil depth table 3 and 0 15 cm distance from the plant base table 4 sm was also higher in rbd than that of ck in 2019 3 5 2 root length density rld among the five treatments evaluated in this study fpm had the highest rld in 2018 however rf ppm and sm also showed significantly higher than that of ck at 105 and 135 das fig 9 by comparing maximum rld rld under rf fpm sm and ppm were 35 0 38 6 20 5 and 31 9 respectively higher than that of the ck in 2019 rld of fpm was significantly the highest at only 45 das and was 47 1 28 2 34 9 and 47 9 higher than that of rf sm ppm and ck at 75 105 and 135 das rld of sm was significantly the highest and that under fpm and ck was the lowest rld the maximum root length density of sm was 31 4 46 2 30 3 and 47 1 higher than that of rf fpm ppm and ck respectively 3 5 3 root area density rad root area density was also significantly different at all growth stages in both seasons fig 9 at 45 das sm was significantly the lowest in rad which was only 0 49 0 44 0 42 and 0 51 times compared with rf fpm ppm and ck respectively by comparing maximum rad rf fpm sm and ppm were 24 8 39 0 21 0 and 11 2 higher than that of the ck in 2018 in 2019 rad of fpm was significantly the highest at 45 das which was 33 9 23 8 27 1 and 38 2 higher than that of rf sm ppm and ck sm got the highest rad as compared with other treatments at 75 das 105 das and 135 das the maximum rad of sm was 24 8 26 0 19 2 and 29 7 higher than that of rf fpm ppm and ck respectively 3 6 root to shoot ratio the root to shoot ratio r s is a parameter that evaluates the distribution of dry matter between roots and shoots the value was the highest during the early growth stages then steadily declined throughout the entire growing period and reaching a minimum value at maturity fig 10 the maximum r s values were obtained at the jointing stage 45 das in both years ranging from 0 171 to 0 224 in 2018 and from 0 130 to 0 191 in 2019 among the different treatments compared with the jointing stage the mean value of r s for all treatments at tasseling 75 das grain filling 105 das and maturity 135 das stages were 54 8 80 1 and 87 7 respectively lower in 2018 and 53 3 70 4 and 85 5 respectively lower in 2019 which indicated that relatively rapid growth and dry matter accumulation in the above ground parts of the plant occur during the middle and later stages of spring maize development the r s was significantly higher under ck at 45 das in 2018 growing season while ck was 18 1 23 7 16 6 and 19 3 higher than that of rf fpm sm and ppm respectively in 2019 r s under ck and sm was significantly the highest at 45 das and 75 das because of their low rate of shoot development while at grain filling stage r s under sm and ppm was significantly the highest because of their high growth rate of root due to higher soil moisture content in deeper soil depth than the other treatments r s under ck was 31 6 29 2 11 0 33 6 at 45 das and 21 8 33 8 13 2 28 4 at 75 das respectively higher than that under rf fpm sm and ppm in 2019 r s under sm was 23 2 20 4 25 4 and 9 8 23 7 17 5 higher than that under rf fpm and ppm at 45 das and 75 das respectively in 2019 by comparing the root to shoot ratio at grain filling stage and maturity stage in 2019 rf and fpm was significantly lower than that of sm ppm and ck r s of rf was 21 5 24 7 20 7 respectively lower and that of fpm was 13 0 16 0 12 2 respectively lower than that of sm ppm and ck 3 7 yield and its components of maize under different mulching practices yield and its components of maize under different mulching treatments were described in table 5 the two seasons mean maize grain yield and biomass yield for each treatment were ranked as fpm rf ppm sm ck higher grain yield was recognized in all plastic mulching treatments than sm and ck in both years sm was also higher than ck but not obvious grain yield of rf fpm and ppm were recorded 1634 kg ha 1 16 9 1638 kg ha 1 16 9 and 572 kg ha 1 5 9 higher in 2018 and 1418 kg ha 1 18 6 3372 kg ha 1 44 1 and 807 kg ha 1 10 6 higher in 2019 than that of ck sm produced very slightly higher grain yield in 2018 and 682 kg ha 1 8 9 higher grain yield in 2019 than that of ck the two seasons mean biomass yield under rf fpm sm and ppm were significantly increased by 2690 kg ha 1 12 5 4456 kg ha 1 20 8 kg ha 1 1097 kg ha 1 5 1 and 1738 kg ha 1 8 1 respectively than that of ck the value of kernels cob in 2018 ranged from 602 to 640 and it ranged from 575 to 730 in 2019 the 100 kernels weight ranged from 38 92 to 41 73 g in 2018 and it ranged from 30 03 to 32 53 g in 2019 the biomass ranged from 24 233 to 26 848 kg ha in 2018 and it ranged from 18 655 to 24 951 in 2019 kg ha among different treatments indicating 100 kernels weight and biomass in 2018 was higher and the kernels cob was lower than that in 2019 the value of hi was significantly the highest under rf in 2018 and that under fpm was significantly the highest in 2019 even though grain yield and biomass yield was higher in 2018 than that in 2019 hi value was not much different by comparing two seasons hi was the highest under fpm by comparing the mean value of two years results shelling percentage was significantly the lowest under ck in both years the mentioned yield components were also higher in mulching treatments than that of ck in both growing seasons generally yield components under fpm were the highest because of its highest plant and root growth from the early growth stage the three yield components ears plant kernels cob and 100 kernels weight decided the final yield ears plant was significantly the highest under rf and ppm in 2018 and that under fpm was the highest in 2019 there was no significant difference in kernels cob under rf fpm ppm and ck in 2018 therefore the higher yield under rf fpm and ppm in 2018 was because of the greater ears and 100 kernels weight however there was no significant difference in ears plant and 100 kernels weight under rf and ck in 2019 therefore the increased yield under rf in 2019 was due to the higher kernels cobs 3 8 relationship between yield and root parameters the results showed that rbd measured at 45 75 105 das and rad measured at 135 das were highly significantly p 0 01 correlated with grain yield and rbd and rld measured at 135 das rad measured at 105 das were also significantly p 0 05 correlated with grain yield in 2018 table 6 there was a positive relationship between maize grain yield and root development in 2018 in 2019 rbd at 45 das p 0 01 and rad at 45 das p 0 05 were significantly correlated with grain yield rld at 45 das and rbd at 75 and 135 das were positively correlated with grain yield however rad and rld at 75 105 135 das and rbd at 105 das were negatively correlated with grain yield rb at 0 30 cm soil depth in each growth stage was positively or significantly correlated with grain yield in both growing seasons table 7 r s was negatively correlated with grain yield at 45 and 75 das in 2018 and positively correlated with grain yield in 105 and 135 das in 2019 r s was negatively correlated with grain yield at all growth stages table 6 determining the relationship between rb at different soil depth rb at 0 30 cm soil depth at all growth stage was positively or significantly correlated with grain yield in both growing seasons table 7 rb in 30 100 cm soil depth at 105 das in both seasons and rb in 30 60 cm depth at 75 das and 135 das in 2019 was negatively correlated with grain yield the relationship between horizontal root biomass distribution and grain yield resulted that root biomass at 0 15 cm distance away from plant base at all growth stages in 2018 45 das and 75 p 0 01 das in 2019 were significantly correlated with grain yield table 8 root biomass at 15 25 cm away from plant base at 75 das in 2018 and 45 das in 2019 was positively correlated with grain yield root biomass at 15 25 cm away from plant base at 45 105 and 135 das in 2018 75 105 and 135 das in 2019 were negatively correlated with grain yield 3 9 relation between rainfall and root parameter simple correlation analysis between rainfall and root biomass density root length density root area density and root to shoot ratio of 2018 and 2019 was mentioned in table 9 the result indicated that rbd and rad measured at all growth stages were significantly or positively correlated with rainfall however rld at 75 105 and 135 das was negatively correlated with rainfall r s was significantly p 0 05 correlated with rainfall at 45 and 75 das however negatively correlated with rainfall at 105 das and positively correlated with rainfall at 135 das 3 10 economic benefit the use of mulching materials and labor caused the obvious differences in the input costs of the various treatments table 10 in both years the total input cost under different mulching treatments followed the order rf sm fpm ppm ck the total output value was ranked as follows fpm rf ppm sm ck which was similar to the grain yield order net income and output input ratio with fpm were the highest and net income was increased by 2044 cny ha 1 in 2018 and 5294 cny ha 1 in 2019 respectively compared with ck the output value of sm was slightly higher than that of ck however the net income was lower than ck in 2018 because of the higher labor cost for manually spreading maize straw 4 discussion 4 1 effect of mulching practices on soil moisture dynamics water shortage is the major constraint for crop growth and production in arid and semiarid regions and water retained in the topsoil is easily lost by evaporation li et al 2013b 2017 mulching with plastic gravel and straw prevented water evaporation from soil surfaces to the atmosphere and increased crop transpiration li et al 2013a zhang et al 2020 in the present study smc under mulching treatments was significantly higher than that under ck plot in 2018 and before sowing 2019 but not significantly different in the growing period of 2019 because of insufficient rain smc under fpm was consistently higher in the upper 0 30 cm soil layer during growing periods and throughout the soil profile in the plenteous rainfall this was mainly because plastic film mulching kept topsoil water content relatively stable by inhibiting evaporation from the soil surface zhou et al 2009 and moreover it enabled the movement of water from the deeper soil layers to the topsoil by capillary action and vapor transfer li et al 1999 tian et al 2003 a similar result was reported by gao et al 2014 who compared smc under different plastic mulching smc under full plastic mulching with double ridge furrow system was the highest which was followed by rf ppm and ck showed the lowest smc in the study of different straw mulching by wang et al 2011b sm showed 10 4 higher smc compared with ck due to the rate of water vapor flux through a mulched straw was generally slow compared that from a moist soil surface li et al 2013b smc of rf and ppm was observed not significantly higher than that of ck especially in the early growth stages this may be because of higher crop transpiration rates during the early growth stage compared with ck that led to low soil moisture content but rather promoted growth with associated greater plant transpiration li et al 1999 li et al 2013b soil moisture under sm was higher than that of rf ppm and even sometimes fpm in some growth stages in the present study in two growing seasons comparing straw mulch with plastic mulch soil moisture content depended not only on types of mulching materials but also based on system such as depth type and size for straw mulch and for plastic full or partial with ridge and furrow partial with flat cultivation or partial with double ridge and furrow and so on moreover smc based on the growth and development of crops their extraction rate of soil moisture and the amount of rainfall distribution in the finding of our research work fpm and sm helped channel rainfall to the maize root zones effectively and efficiently sm also retained soil moisture almost similar to fpm especially in crop growing period however the yield of sm was not as high as plastic mulching treatments due to the less efficient water use rf and ppm also channeled rainwater to the maize root zones however some part of the rainwater might have flown to the uncovered strips of the land area with less rainwater channeling to the root zones compared with fpm and sm by comparing rf and ppm retaining smc amount was almost the same however plant growth and yield were lower under ppm the flat planting without mulching was the poorest in harvesting rainfall leading to rapid evaporation of rainwater and therefore the lowest in smc 4 2 effect of mulching practices on evaporation water loss from evaporation is a serious constraint in flat dryland areas similar to a runoff because the evaporation rate was almost one third of total water receiving in the non mulch plot 24 5 under wheat straw mulch and 6 3 under plastic mulch plot li et al 2013b the evaporation rate of rf and ppm was higher than that of fpm because partial plastic mulching did not effective in decreasing soil moisture loss through surface evaporation from the non mulch area under fpm evaporation can normally occur only from the small gaps along some edges and the destruction area about 0 5 5 of the total surface area by weed wind farmers activities and seed hole wu et al 2017b in this study the soil evaporation rate under plastic mulching was significantly lower compared with the sm and ck the evaporation rate of sm was also significantly lower than that of ck the same result was recorded by li et al 2013b the lower evaporation rate of sm than that of ck was mainly because straw mulch reduced the quantity of direct solar radiation reaching the soil surface which reduced the amount of energy available for changing water from a liquid to a gas and mulch itself acted as an insulator for the downward conduction of heat into the soil phillips 1983 unger et al 2012 therefore water in a deep layer of soil was difficult to change into vapor and escaped from the soil surface in our experiment the evaporation rate of rf fpm sm and ppm was 32 6 57 0 13 4 and 27 4 respectively lower than that of the ck by comparing the mean value of two growing seasons by comparing the mean value of evaporation loss under all treatments at different growth stages the highest evaporation rate was recorded in 45 75 das jointing to tasseling stage in both years because more moist soil surface high temperature as well as lower canopy caused high evaporation rate the lowest evaporation rate was recorded in 75 105 das tasseling to grain filling stage in 2018 because the plant was at the maximum growth stage the plant canopy reduced the evaporation rate of the soil since shading by the canopy accounted for at least three fourths of the evaporation reduction todd et al 1991 in 2019 the lowest evaporation rate was recorded at 0 45 das seedling to the jointing stage because a dry surface due to absence of rainfall for about 25 consecutive days and low soil temperature reduced evaporation comparing the evaporation rate of rf and ppm the evaporation rate under rf was significantly lower than that of ppm 10 1 in 2018 because rf had the larger plant growth than that of ppm in 2018 however there was slightly lower 4 1 in dryer year in 2019 since the plant growth was not much different in 2018 even though the total number of days measured for the evaporation rate was lower than that of 2019 the evaporation rate of 2018 was higher than that of 2019 since the precipitation rate of 2018 was higher and more even as a result the evaporation rate from moist soil surface was higher 4 3 effect of mulching practices on transpiration mulching enhanced water flux exchange between maize plants and atmosphere thus increased transpiration rate and resulting in higher maize root water uptake and more sap flow going through the maize stem feng et al 2019 our results indicated that the transpiration rate of fpm was the highest which was followed by rf ppm sm and ck showed the lowest at all growth stages transpiration rate of rf fpm sm and ppm was 71 102 25 and 44 higher than that of the ck plot during the measuring period a similar result was observed by feng et al 2019 and gong et al 2017 who reported that plastic mulching obviously improved sap flow as compared with ck treatment heading and the grain filling stages are the highest plant growth and maximum water consumption stages in this study heading stage got the highest transpiration rate among the three growth stages however gong et al 2017 study indicated grain filling stage achieved the highest transpiration rate the highest transpiration at heading stages in this study was because of more rainfall occurred in this stage the lowest transpiration at the maturity stage was because of the crop mature and soil dryness 4 4 effect of mulching practices on root distribution the distribution of roots in soil profiles is important in determining water and nutrient uptake since the root system directly affects the growth of the above ground parts and grain yield liu et al 2009 2017 many researchers have been reported that different plastic and straw mulching practices have increased moisture in the topsoil and soil temperature wu et al 2017a zhou et al 2009 promoted stand establishment and plant growth gao et al 2017 li et al 2017 finally improved grain yield liu et al 2014 since mulching probably improved soil structure dong et al 2018 and enhanced nutrient cycling in the soil fang et al 2011 maize in the full film with double ridge and furrow mulching systems had significantly greater root growth parameters compared to half film mulching and non mulched plot gao et al 2014 rld and rad were significantly higher under plastic film mulch and biodegradable film mulch as compared with flat planting jia et al 2018 mulching increased maize root dry weight and length in the 0 20 cm soil layer and root activity at maturity niu et al 2020 however there was a lack of scientific information that mentioned how different types of plastic mulching and straw mulching would affect 2d maize crop root growth and distribution across the rooting zone in the present study we measured the detailed root growth patterns by vertically and horizontally using soil monolith excavation method across the rooting zone under different film mulching and straw mulching therefore the findings of the current research work will fill the gap of how mulching improves the synchronization of soil water transport and root water uptake for maize crop the global average distribution of root mass for all biomes and vegetation types was 50 in the upper 0 2 m and 75 in the upper 0 4 m gregory 2006 most of the root of the annual crop is located in the 0 20 cm soil depth fageria 2012 in oilseed and legume crops without film mulch about 80 of root dry weight was in the soil layer above 40 cm liu et al 2012 our data also showed consistently in both years that the majority of the maize roots were situated in the top 30 cm soil depth and 0 15 cm from the plant base under all treatments and generally the root weight density decreased substantially with the soil depth and away from the plant base mulching does not alter the root distribution across the root zones and root growth patterns are similar under all treatments in both seasons root biomass density rbd is the most essential parameters used for root characteristics evaluation jia et al 2018 in this study plastic mulching treatments were higher in root biomass density compared with ck and sm in both seasons especially in the 0 30 cm soil depth since soil water and nutrient in this soil horizon might be more favorable for the growth of maize root qi et al 2012 thus the maize grain yield was positively correlated with rbd in the top 0 30 cm soil depth a similar result was observed in jia et al 2018 niu et al 2020 and wang et al 2014 who reported that grain yield was strongly positively correlated with rbd in the top soil layers rbd under fpm was significantly the highest in 2018 however slightly higher in the 0 30 cm than that of ck and not as high as ppm and sm after 75 das in 2019 because drought stress reduces the accumulation of nitrogen and phosphorus in roots and restricts root growth and distribution in the soil gajri et al 1989 although the total root biomass reduces during drought water deficits may increase the proportion of roots in deep soil layers which favors water and nutrient absorption under stress conditions coelho and or 1999 therefore rbd below 30 cm soil depth was greater in 2019 than that in 2018 however total root biomass in 2019 was lower than that in 2018 rbd of ppm and sm was higher than that under fpm below 30 cm soil depth at grain filling stage as shown in table 3 while the yield in ppm and sm was lower than that in fpm indicating more biomass distributed in the root system was not conducive to yield improvement because root biomass was negatively correlated with grain yield under drought year or at grain filling stage the higher the plant growth and the grain yield the lower the root biomass in deep soil layer at grain filling stage was observed in this study root biomass was negatively correlated with grain yield in 30 100 cm soil depth at 105 das in both seasons and 30 60 cm soil depth at 75 das and 135 das in 2019 as shown in table 7 the same result was observed by wang et al 2014 who indicated that more biomass distributed in the root system only the uppermost 0 20 cm soil layers was conducive to yield improvement this was mainly because under water stress condition or grain filling stage absorption of water and nutrient of crop favors mainly for plant growth and grain filling than root growth the previous study has shown that root growth was consistently higher under plastic film mulching on the ridge and non mulch furrow treatment than that of biodegradable film mulch soil crust mulch and traditional flat planting in both growing seasons because the rainfall amount was simulated with 430 mm in both year jia et al 2018 root length is a better parameter of root growth to correlate with the absorption of water and nutrients since high root length is linked to a short travel distance of water and solutes andrews and newman 1970 root length density and rooting depth for brassica napus kirkegaard et al 1997 and pisum sativum liu et al 2012 were highly related to water availability in the findings of our research in 2019 the plants continuously exploited soil moisture for plant growth and when the upper soil moisture was exhausted the root needs to prolong to extract soil moisture from the lower soil layer especially after 75 das in 2019 consequently the distribution of root in the lower soil layer was higher in 2019 than that of 2018 rld and rad were significantly the highest under fpm in 2018 however rld and rad were significantly the highest under sm and ppm in 2019 after 45 das since smc in the lower soil layer of these treatments were higher in 2019 root length as well as root weight has a positive correlation with grain yield however root dry weight has a higher correlation with grain yield compared with maximum root length fageria 2012 furthermore it was reported that root weight density root length density root diameter and root volume density in legumes were positively related to soil water availability liu et al 2012 in the present study generally there was a positive relationship between maize grain yield and root growth parameters rld rad and rbd under rainy year and negative correlation with grain yield under drought year table 6 by comparing the relation between grain yield and 2d root biomass distribution root biomass in the top 0 30 soil depth and the nearest plant base 0 15 cm was significantly or positively correlated with grain yield table 7 8 under sufficient soil moisture however under insufficient soil moisture conditions and grain filling stage 105 das there was negative correlation between grain yield and root biomass at 30 100 cm soil depth and 15 25 cm distance from the plant base the improvement of grain yield is closely related to the dry matter distribution ratio between above ground parts and the root system because roots and shoots organically constitute the entire functional system of a crop then assimilate consumed by the roots is twice than that of the shoots passioura 1983 thus crops with lower r s ratios which partition more dry matter to above ground biomass will achieve higher wue and grain yields ma et al 2010 zhang et al 2009 however after anthesis the amount of assimilates translocated to the root system is very small and the net size of the root system hardly increases and even declines as the roots die gregory 1994 r s in this study was negatively correlated with grain yield in both growing seasons except 105 and 135 das in 2018 because plants could utilize nutrients and water sufficiently not only for shoot development but also for root growth in the present study maximum r s was observed at 45 das in both years and gradually decreased until maturity r s under ck and sm at 45 and 75 das was higher than plastic mulching because of the lower shoot growth compared with rf fpm and ppm r s under ppm sm and ck at 105 das in 2019 was significantly higher than that of rf and fpm because root biomass of ppm sm and ck were higher and shoot biomass was lower than that of rf and fpm 4 5 effect of mulching practices on yield crop yield is the economic part of the plant used for humans and animals consumption and it reflects the management system and soil productivity in the present study significant differences in grain yield were observed among different cultivation systems higher yield and yield components were obtained under mulching treatments in this study among the five mulching treatments maize yield under fpm was significantly the highest and that of rf was the second highest maize yield under fpm and rf was 16 9 16 9 and was 44 1 18 6 higher than under ck in 2018 and in 2009 respectively ppm and sm also produced slightly higher maize grain yield than that of ck some related studies have demonstrated that rf fpm sm and ppm were significantly increased maize biomass and grain yield dong et al 2018 gao et al 2014 2019 gong et al 2017 li et al 2001 2013a li et al 2017 wang et al 2011b although different results from mulching technologies were observed between the current research and other investigations the mulching effects on increasing maize yields were consistent this was probably because of high infiltration rate of rainwater into the soil liu et al 2014 reducing soil water loss through surface evaporation li et al 2013b as a consequence increased soil moisture storage enhanced transpiration rate feng et al 2019 promoted the growth of the root gao et al 2014 improved root water uptake and stomata behavior gao et al 2014 ramakrishna et al 2006 these improvements resulted in more plant assimilation biomass accumulation and finally improved grain yields under mulching plots gong et al 2015 among mulching practices maize yield under plastic mulching plots was significantly the highest since plastic mulching promoted crop growth better than sm and ck from the early growth stages wang et al 2015 the photosynthetic rate was higher and more co2 was assimilated in maize under plastic mulching plots because of a significant correlation between green leaf area index photosynthetically active radiation temperature soil water content and root water transport gao et al 2017 gong et al 2015 maize yield under fpm was significantly the highest since the highest early growth rate by comparing rf and ppm even though ppm retained smc similar the sap flow rate of maize under rf was higher therefore the assimilation rate was higher and plant growth and yield were higher under rf than that under ppm biomass yield and 100 kernels weight in 2018 was higher and the kernels cob was lower than that in 2019 this was mainly because of the different varieties in 2018 the variety ningyu 524 was sown and the variety qiangsheng 999 was sown in 2019 moreover precipitation amount was lower in 2019 that also affected the biomass weight and 100 kernels weight even though grain yield and biomass yield was higher in 2018 than that in 2019 hi value was not much different by comparing two seasons this might be because of dry matter mobilization efficiency dmme the previous study reported that the grain filling of well watered treatments lasted less than that of the less watered treatments resulting lower hi and dmme and the yield potential of the well watered treatments was restricted under this condition zhang et al 2008 in this study there was much rainfall in grain filling stage in 2018 it might cause shorter to grain filling duration of maize and caused the reduction in biomass transferred to kernels that could not achieve the potential grain production and effect lower hi on the other hand it was reported that moderate water deficit during grain filling increased mobilization of assimilate stored in vegetative tissues to grains resulting in greater grain yield and wue zhang et al 2008 in 2019 maize plant might suffer moderate water deficit and could get the yield potential under its current situation therefore both grain yield and biological yield in 2019 were lower than that in 2018 however hi value was not much different determining labor cost during land preparing after plowing crop residue as well as plastic mulch and straw mulch residue were removed together before sowing maize therefore labor usage for removing residue was almost the same for all treatments the labor cost of rf was higher than that of fpm and ppm to do ridge and furrow mulching with maize straw by manually was also laborious therefore labor cost for straw mulching was the highest even though the cost for plastic mulching of fpm was the highest weed could not be grown well under fpm thus it had lower total input cost compared with rf and sm in both years the total input cost under different treatments followed the order rf sm fpm ppm ck the total output value was ranked as follows fpm rf ppm sm ck which was a similar order as the grain yield table 10 therefore the net income of fpm was the highest among different mulching treatments by comparing the net income of two years the net income of rf fpm and ppm was increased by 1492 3669 and 506 cny ha 1 while net income of sm was decreased by 273 cny ha 1 compared with ck 5 conclusion this study indicated how different mulching systems performed differently in synchronization of seasonal soil water transport and root water absorption process at the root soil interface the majority of the maize root 80 were distributed in vertically 30 cm soil depth and for horizontally 70 85 0 15 cm from the plant base under rainy year however under drought year more plant root extended to both horizontal and vertical sites to exploit soil moisture and about 65 of maize root were distributed in the top 30 cm soil depth therefore root length was negatively correlated with rainfall grain yield was positively correlated with rbd in the entire soil profile under rainy year while negatively correlated with rbd in the deep 30 100 cm soil depth and 15 25 cm away from the plant base under insufficient soil moisture and at grain filling stage all the mulching practices produced a higher grain yield than that of ck among them fpm contributed the highest grain yield and was 16 9 in 2018 and 44 1 in 2019 higher than that of ck in fpm the large yield was correlated with the improved root systems particularly on the top 30 cm soil depth due to increased soil water content especially in top 30 cm soil depth although maize plants in the various mulching systems showed a similar root distribution pattern across the soil profile root biomass under fpm was significantly the highest which was 40 9 and 48 0 higher while r s under fpm was 27 9 and 41 2 lower than that of ck at 45 das in 2018 and 2019 indicating that shoot growth was also obviously increased from the early growth stage because of significantly improved soil moisture content and early vigorous of the root and shoot the evaporation rate was reduced the sap flow rate was promoted and grain yield was higher under plastic mulching treatments among plastic mulching treatments fpm produced the highest grain yield which was followed the order by rf and ppm sm also produced a slightly higher grain yield than that of ck full plastic mulching showed the best synchronization of soil water transport and root water uptake therefore it is concluded that fpm could be an effective sustainable system for maize production in this study region and this method will bring an increased in income of the maize farmers however it is needed to consider the environmental problem white

the adoption of awd system has contributed to significantly reduce the global warming potential gwp and water use li et al 2011 mazza et al 2016 although the reports on irrigation management to reduce flooding in rice and its effects on rice yield are still contrasting adhya et al 2014 for instance there are reports of increase yang et al 2004 liang et al 2016 jabran et al 2016 and decrease oliver et al 2008 lagomarsino et al 2016 chu et al 2018 in yield under awd system than the cf system these contrasting results indicate need to optimize and implement site specific irrigation management options considering soil properties drainage frequency duration of flooding cycles as well as variety adaptability mazza et al 2016 a combination of water saving production systems and water saving irrigation systems may help increase water productivity water use efficiency and economic returns by reducing the gwp although a number of studies have specifically focused on the effect of awd on grain yield water use efficiency nitrogen use efficiency nue and ghgs emissions nevertheless a comprehensive review on the influence of the awd system of rice production on soil health crop quality and environmental sustainability is still lacking to comprehend this approach as an alternative to traditional flooded rice system this review provides a contemporary synthesis of existing data regarding the performance of awd in relation to different soil properties and crop growth stage awd influence on rice yield and quality heavy metals accumulation and emission of ghgs emission in paddy fields 2 overview of awd and its development under awd fields are subjected to alternating flooding and drying rather than continuous flooding throughout the crop season zhang et al 2009 fields are re flooded when soil surface attains the aerobic state as water is allowed to subside via percolation and evapotranspiration it means that instead of keeping the paddy field continuously flooded the paddy fields are subjected to dry wet cycles the international rice research institute irri developed awd in the 1970s bouman and tuong 2001 belder et al 2004 which has been widely adopted on heavy textured soil in china as mid season drainage more than 12 mha area each year zhang et al 2010a ye et al 2013 and has been accepted in several asian countries e g india bangladesh vietnam and philippines kukal et al 2005 bouman 2007 and usa carrijo et al 2017 besides china the implementation of awd in other countries is limited kürschner et al 2010a b lampayan et al 2015a cabangon et al 2016 several factors such as climatic conditions degree of mechanization quantity and availability of irrigational water and rainfall soil type and success in maintaining or increasing yield are major constraints in worldwide adoption of the awd van den berg et al 2007 wassmann et al 2009 though there are numerous potential benefits of using the awd irrigation technique fig 1 but it is not easy for farmers to use it practically as without developing simple irrigation indices it is hard for them to choose the best time for irrigation application irri and institute for agro environmental science niaes japan established a set of easy guidelines for awd application using a field water polyvinyl chloride pvc tube as a device to monitor the field water level minamikawa et al 2015 the awd comprises of three basic key elements 1 shallow flooding for the first 2 weeks after seeding or transplanting to recover seedlings from transplanting shock and to suppress weed emergence liang et al 2013 2 thin layer 2 3 cm of standing water from panicle initiation pi to the end of flowering because this duration is very sensitive toward water deficit and 3 awd cycle during all other growth periods bouman et al 2006 yang et al 2017 the awd system ensures supply of the physiological water demand of rice by controlling water supply and enables to cut short the irrigation total water input in awd implementation threshold level duration of drying periods and frequency of irrigation can be decided by a attaining certain soil water potential threshold level using tensiometers b re flooding after a fixed number of non flooded days 4 5 days and 6 8 days for lighter and heavy soils respectively as adopted in some region of china li and barker 2004 c after the appearance of cracking in the soil surface d visual symptoms of water shortage indicated by plant appearance e when the water level in field drops to a certain limit below the soil surface peng and bouman 2007 and f technique of ditch irrigation making shallow ditches at 2 m distance in rice field saves 40 50 water inputs but it is cumbersome to make and maintain ditches guo et al 2004 fig 2 in awd fields are subjected to periodic cycles of wetting and drying and these cycles are closely linked with the number of factors including the soil texture soil water potential plant water status and watehr elements bouman 2007 shao et al 2014 the field water tube developed by irri can be used to invigilate the water level beneath the soil surface half perforated field water tubes can be made by using bamboo pvc pipe tin cans or even plastic bottles having a diameter of 10 20 cm the use of perforated field water tubes enables farmers to monitor the water table easily irrigation to a depth of around 5 cm is applied and then the farmers wait until the perched water table falls to a certain limit beneath the soil surface due to percolation drainage and evapotranspiration the fields are then re irrigated when field water level fwl reaches 15 cm in water pipes below the soil surface and reflooding at this fwl is termed as safe awd bouman et al 2006 threshold level at safe awd increases or maintains the yield with water saving of 15 30 as at this threshold level roots of plants are still able to acquire sufficient water from the saturated soil and perched groundwater for growth and development farms are encouraged to implement the safe awd technique during vegetative growth tillering to pi and then at the grain filling stage lampayan et al 2015a based on soil water potential or field water level awd is categorized as safe awd mild moderate awd and severe awd fig 3 among these safe awd is now recommended and increasingly adopted by farmers in various asian countries including india vietnam philippines and bangladesh lin et al 2013 palis et al 2014 lampayan et al 2015a sandhu et al 2017 kar et al 2018 under safe awd practice soil water regimes are shifted from flooding to non flooding saturated or unsaturated conditions tan et al 2015 and drying periods can vary from 1 to more than 10 days depending upon soil textural class and soil organic matter bouman et al 2006 ye et al 2013 the number of drying events their duration water saving and level of flooding depend on the climatic conditions availability of water soil type percolation and evapotranspiration water losses and crop growth stage bouman et al 2006 chu et al 2014 the awd technique is being used under transplanted sandhu et al 2017 kar et al 2018 ishfaq et al 2020 as well as the dsr systems carrijo et al 2017 ishfaq et al 2020 the application of water saving techniques like awd or mid drainage in both water intensive conventional flooded puddled transplanted rice system cf trp or water saving system dsr reduce the water input and presumed negative influence on growth physiology and yield of rice however mishra 2012 and jabran et al 2017 reported that shifting from cf to unsaturated conditions awd or aerobic rice did not affect the growth of rice plants in conclusion overall awd reduces water inputs by 26 as compared to cf however in lieu of maintaining yield the mild awd reduce water inputs by 23 carrijo et al 2017 3 soil properties and awd performance alternate wetting and drying cycles and its effect on crop performance and final yields depend on soil texture soil ph soil organic carbon soil microbes and the climatic conditions sandhu et al 2017 norton et al 2017 the shift in cultivation practice from cf to aerobic soil awd condition causes variations in soil aeration soil water contents and nutrient availability due to mineralization timsina and connor 2001 ye et al 2013 fig 4 tan et al 2013 described that the exchange of air between atmosphere and soil is improved under awd practice which leads to mineralization of soil organic matter and soil n immobilization is inhibited due to adequate oxygen supply this helps to improve soil fertility and the availability of essential nutrients for the growth of rice plants dong et al 2012 according to carrijo et al 2017 when fields were irrigated at fwl of 15 cm soil water potential swp reached to 20 kpa similarly when fields were irrigated at fwl of 20 cm swp reached to 20 kpa a thin layer of standing water or even without standing water on the soil surface in paddies led to increased penetration of oxygen into the soil which oxidizes the soil organic carbon to co2 beside ch4 and eventually lowers the ch4 emissions sun et al 2016 in acidic soil ph 6 5 the performance of awd irrigation in terms of yield is comparatively better than soil having ph 7 due to many reasons carrijo et al 2017 firstly presence of a higher percentage of exchangeable sodium na in soil having ph 8 causes formation of impermeable soil layer and disintegration of soil particles abrol et al 1985 this may be a constraint to plant growth and development in awd conditions where roots are deeper but may not affect plants in the cf system where rice has a shallow root system yang et al 2004 secondly na toxicity problem is rare under the cf system due to the leaching of na ions from the root zone under the drying cycle of awd higher uptake of na may occur due to higher availability of na ions abrol et al 1985 which makes rice less tolerant for na toxicity under the awd system thirdly ammonia volatilization in alkaline soil in drying events of awd may enhance the nitrogen losses moormann and van breemen 1978 so the practice of severe awd in alkaline soil results in more yield reduction than practice of severe awd in acidic soil carrijo et al 2017 the awd irrigation can reduce irrigation water requirements by 50 but at the same time it may increase the electrical conductivity ec value of field water in contrast with cf nhan et al 2016 increased soil ec might be attributed to increase in mineralization and concentration of dissolved ions that is lower under cf condition due to dilution effect adviento borbe et al 2006 similarly in cf fields soil redox potential eh remain lower throughout the rice season due to the reduced conditions while under awd fields soil eh remains higher xiao et al 2015 takahashi et al 2004 recorded analogous trends during cf in the field and xu et al 2008 in greenhouse studies and suggested that o2 deprivation is improbable to oxidize the bulk soil under cf conditions lower soil eh in cf induces reduction of methanogens ferric iron fe iii chromium cr vi manganese mn iv and sulfate xiao et al 2015 under awd irrigation soil eh decreased instantly after flooding due to deprivation of o2 that led to increase in reduction reactions while soil eh increased again from drying to the next wetting due to increased o2 supply under awd conditions soil eh may increase from 291 mv to 142 mv in oxi soils and from 254 mv to 189 mv in phaeozem soils xiao et al 2015 fluctuating soil eh under awd is an important factor to mitigate the cr xiao et al 2015 and as toxicity in rice grains carrijo et al 2018 islam et al 2019 sellathurai et al 2016 postulated that dry spells of short duration may not reduce the soil organic matter som while long duration dry spells significantly reduce the som according to birch 1958 the soil carbon mineralization is increased after flooding and due to activities of methanogenic bacteria the available carbon is converted to ch4 while under short duration dry spell the ch4 emission is hampered which reduces the loss of som in contrast dry spell of longer duration reduces the som that can be attributed to the abundance of root biomass a higher rate of n mineralization of som due to aerobic degradation which are highly correlated kader et al 2013 application of awd cycles not only influences the activity of soil microbes and water uptake but also affect the nutrient cycling by microbes and the availability of nutrients to plants dodd et al 2015 aanaerobic soil conditions under cf causes reduction in the population and diversity of soil microbes than the aerobic soil awd management kassam et al 2011 aerobic conditions of a dry spell of awd are healthy for increasing soil microbes which enhance the mineralization and subsequent release of nutrients in the rhizosphere the soil properties vary under awd irrigation which ultimately affects the performance of rice in the awd rice system carrijo et al 2017 the practice of awd irrigation in soils having soc 1 perform better because soc is correlated with aggregate stability low bulk density improved soil structure and high porosity all of which enhance the water availability to plants and also improve the water holding capacity murphy 2014 in contrast implementation of awd irrigation in alkaline soil having low soc may not yield well carrijo et al 2017 similarly soil texture is one of the most important factors that help in deciding the duration of awd cycles which can vary from 1 to 10 days depending upon soil texture sandhu et al 2017 for instance in clayey soils california rice soils 15 of total applied water is lost through percolation and it requires more time to achieve required soil moisture potential linquist et al 2015a whereas in sandy loam soils the percolation losses are 51 and the required drying stage is achieved in a short time span sharma et al 2002 besides irrigation scheduling the quantum of irrigation water and irrigation command area are also influenced by soil texture for example frequent and light irrigation is required for coarse textured soils while fine textured soils require heavy irrigation at extended intervals darzi naftchali et al 2017 carrijo et al 2018 the aspect that how soil texture influences the relative performance of awd needs further studies in conclusion heavy textured soil clayey require less frequent heavy irrigation because field water depth subsides slowly while in light textured soil frequent and light irrigations are required so more number of awd cycle are recorded under light textured soil than the heavy textured soil moreover in light textured soil severe awd does not yield well than that of on heavy textured soil 4 rice growth phenology reproduction grain filling and yield formation under awd system 4 1 root and shoot growth the awd system helps to improve the growth and development of root and shoot yang and zhang 2010 thakur et al 2011 root proliferation may be restricted when the awd technique is practiced in fields with an impermeable soil layer which may restrict plant root and shoot growth yang et al 2004 under such conditions oxygen supply to roots could be enhanced by a sub surface drainage system kerbiriou et al 2013 application of mild awd conditions along with the normal application of nitrogenous fertilizes increased the root and shoot growth as well as root density and biomass kato and okami 2010 mishra and salokhe 2010 pascual and wang 2017 the drying cycle of awd facilitates the root proliferation which ensures higher uptake of nutrient and water higher leaf area index and increased leaf elongation rate dobermann and fairhurst 2000 kirk 2004 higher root hydraulic conductivity of deep roots is critical for water and nutrient extraction from the rhizosphere that ensures optimal water for better growth ludlow and muchow 1990 parent et al 2009 pascual and wang 2017 after re irrigation the plants responses quickly and increase the net assimilation rate darzi naftchalia et al 2017 the leaf has a positive correlation with net assimilation rate zain and ismail 2016 and paddy yield has a significant relation with the leaf area index li et al 2014 anbumozhi et al 1998 reported that severe awd results in root decay leaf discoloration and ultimately reduces the shoot growth and yield hence there is a need for awd specifications for its implementation in different parts of the world severe drying of awd also reduces relative water contents inhibits cell division elongation and cell wall thickening maheswari et al 2007 kima et al 2015 reduces evapotranspiration and chlorophyll contents mostajean and eichi 2009 kima et al 2014 moreover it also decreases total carotenoids cha um et al 2010 increases electrolyte leakage jahan et al 2014 pigment degradation reduces photosynthetic rate tuna et al 2010 leaf cell expansion and translocation of assimilates under severe drying event davantgar et al 2009 awd irrigation brings physiological and biochemical modifications in rice plants sun et al 2012 chu et al 2018 physiological plant adaptations under awd irrigation are alteration in phytohormonal synthesis dodd et al 2015 pascual and wang 2017 increased the metabolic activity of roots thakur et al 2011 yang et al 2017 chu et al 2018 and higher photosynthetic rate mishra et al 2006 zhang et al 2009 jabran et al 2017 chu et al 2018 the drying cycle of awd causes more accumulation of abscisic acid aba in roots due to enhanced root aba biosynthesis but translocation of aba to shoots was hampered due to decreased water uptake dodd et al 1996 belimov et al 2009 dodd et al 2015 yang et al 2017 xylem aba was increased following re irrigation in the leaf due to translocation from roots pérez pérez and dodd 2015 norton et al 2017 the factors influencing the duration and rate of aba upon re irrigation include the accumulated aba pool previously dried roots water uptake dynamics aba efflux and aba losses via the metabolism of roots dodd et al 2015 upon re wetting higher root water potential may increase the concentration of cytokinin in the xylem hansen and dörffling 2003 zhang et al 2010a mote et al 2018 in comparison to continuous flooding system under awd re wetting event cytokinin levels i e zeatin z zeatin riboside zr is increased in roots as well as in leaves both z zr are very active cytokinin and plays an important role in delaying senescence and boosting cell division del pozo et al 2005 similarly increased activity of enzymes involved in ammonia assimilation and metabolism of plant n was observed by sun et al 2012 in case of root indole acetic acid show no change under re wetting period after mild drying but increased by 25 under severe soil drying event dodd et al 2015 these physiological changes in roots delayed the leaf senescence and enhanced crop performance yang et al 2012 irrigation application according to awd also enhanced the rice performance by altering leaf angle davies et al 2011 increased leaf area duration reducing unproductive tillers and increasing the productive tillers yang and zhang 2010 howell et al 2015 kima et al 2015 norton et al 2017 moreover as a result of increased vegetative growth the canopy structure was also improved sandhu et al 2017 4 2 awd performance at different phenological stages compared to other crops rice is more sensitive to water deficit at critical stages e g stand establishment panicle initiation anthesis and grain filling stages sarvestani et al 2008 davantgar et al 2009 mote et al 2018 jones 2004 highlighted that different plants respond to water deficit in a complex way and numerous mechanisms are assumed by plants when they come across water deficit at different growth stages e g closure of the stomata phenotypic plasticity etc with respect to phenological stages of rice implementing awd at the reproductive stage caused yield reduction in comparison to awd implementation at the vegetative stage carrijo et al 2017 mote et al 2018 at mid tillering awd implementation increases the translocation of photosynthates to the developing panicles by altering the source sink relationship and reduces the competition with panicle development davantgar et al 2009 pascual and wang 2017 the overlapping of the awd drying cycle and panicle initiation stage heading or flowering stage resulted in a reduction in the number of panicles per hill and numbers of kernels per panicle which results in reduced grain yields pascual and wang 2017 according to lu et al 2000 soil water potential 10 or 20 kpa until the reproductive stage did not affect dry matter production significantly lu et al 2000 at the reproductive stage irrigation deficit resulted in a higher unfilled grain percentage kumar et al 2006 pascual and wang 2017 ishfaq et al 2020 sarvestani et al 2008 and mote et al 2018 observed that awd application at booting stage delayed flowering and seed set moreover at the flowering stage the drying cycle of awd resulted in flower abortion and grain abscission davantgar et al 2009 pascual and wang 2017 4 3 grain filling and yield formation early flowering spikelets exhibit similar grain phytohormonal concentration and rate of grain filling in awd as well as in cf but late flowering spikelets exhibit marked differences in grain phytohormonal concentrations under awd irrigation technique zhang et al 2010a the higher concentration of aba in grain was observed under awd during the grain filling stage but fluctuation was noted in the concentration of cytokinin grain along with awd cycles and soil drying severity zhang et al 2010a yang et al 2017 mote et al 2018 re wetting after mild drying enhanced the concentration of cytokinin grain but decreased grain cytokinin concentration was observed after severe drying pascual and wang 2017 increased cytokinin concentration in inferior spikelets upon re wetting time enhances the sink strength by increasing cell division of endosperm and grain filling rate zhang et al 2009 and upregulating the gene expression of the enzyme encoding sucrose to starch pathway enzyme i e cell wall invertase werner et al 2008 altering phytohormonal signaling not only influences leaf gas exchange but also alters the grain filling rate due to activities of enzymes involved in sucrose to starch conversion and enhanced photosynthetic rate zhang et al 2012a yang et al 2017 jabran et al 2017 chu et al 2018 moreover under mild soil drying at the grain filling stage the elevated aba level could enhance the remobilization of assimilates pre stored in leaves and stem the grain filling rate of inferior spikelets hinder stomatal conductance and hence increase harvest index yang and zhang 2010 marcaida et al 2014 jabran et al 2017 while severe awd at grain filling stage hampered the grain filling might be due to the hindrance of assimilates translocation to sink due to water deficit pascual and wang 2017 at post anthesis stage awd implication increased grain filling rate significantly which is attributed to increased root oxidation activity photosynthetic rate flag leaf and activity of sucrose to starch conversion enzymes sucrose synthase sus phosphate synthase starch synthase sts adenosine diphosphate glucose pyro phosphorylase adpg and starch branching enzyme sbe during grain filling stage zhang et al 2008 2012a chu et al 2015 2018 during drying cycle of awd increased aba concentration enhanced the translocation of photosynthates toward developing grains due to increased activities of enzymes in stem sus and phosphate synthase sts adpg and sbe enzymes in rice kernel zhang et al 2009 chen et al 2016 it is believed that the re synthesis of sucrose is mediated by sucrose phosphate synthase sps wardlaw and willenbrink 1994 chen et al 2016 during soil drying of mild awd the aba concentration is elevated and in response sps activity is also increased chen et al 2016 increased sps not only maintains the photosynthates flux from leaves to grains but also increases the accumulation of disaccharide in response to soil drying isopp et al 2000 adoption of awd technique may increase ye et al 2013 liu et al 2013 chu et al 2014 norton et al 2017 or maintain grain yields linquist et al 2015a liang et al 2016 as compared to continuous flooding cf rice production system table 2 however yield may be lower than the cf system in some cases yadav et al 2012 linquist et al 2015a inconsistency in grain yield under awd might be attributed to management practices and climatic conditions among management practices experimental conditions soil organic carbon soil type establishment methods number of drains un availability of awd tools soil drying threshold level groundwater table and soil hydrological conditions may influence the final goals of awd and are also responsible for such inconsistencies in awd performance belder et al 2004 yao et al 2012 carrijo et al 2017 moreover agronomic practices genetic makeup of genotytpes used and climatic conditions may affect the final yield moormann and van breemen 1978 stated that awd application in alkaline soils reduced the final yields that might be attributed to more n losses via ammonia volatilization as n uptake is reduced under non flooded conditions of alkaline soil among the soil drying threshold levels safe awd can be practiced in different environments without sacrificing yield linquist et al 2015a lampayan et al 2015a liang et al 2016 yang et al 2017 carrijo et al 2018 while under certain circumstance severe awd does not affect the yield carrijo et al 2017 in terms of yield reduction it is more important at which crop growth stage awd cycles are applied and to how much soil should be dried when irrigation is to be applied li et al 2019 under mild safe awd the reason for no yield penalty under most circumstances beside sandy soils is the field water level that is not allowed to drop down below 15 cm from the soil surface or swp remains 20 kpa while yield is reduced up to 22 under severe awd where the soil is dried beyond 20 kpa as compared to cf carrijo et al 2017 similarly yields reduction by 8 was noted when the awd cycle was imposed during the whole crop season while awd cycle exposure at only vegetative stage resulted in no yield reduction application of awd cycles at critical growth stages may reduce the yield significantly chidthaisong et al 2018 sun et al 2019 that is attributed to grain abscission flower abortion a higher percentage of sterile spikelets and unfilled grains under severe awd davantgar et al 2009 norton et al 2017 pascual and wang 2017 however in awd techniques the yield is maintained by the deep and extensive root system and availability of moisture at deeper soil layer chu et al 2018 pascual and wang 2017 carrijo et al 2018 similarly a significant source of water may be achieved through a shallow water table or the rise of capillary water to the root zone bouman et al 2006 tan et al 2014 a higher yields potential under awd might be attributed to more effective tillers yang and zhang 2010 yadav et al 2014 howell et al 2015 norton et al 2017 ishfaq et al 2020 more translocation of photosynthates to grains bueno and lafarge 2009 kar et al 2018 decreased sterile spikelet percentage increased filled grains percentage davantgar et al 2009 zhang et al 2010a mote et al 2018 increased panicle biomass matsuo and mochizuki 2009 yushi et al 2013 chu et al 2018 and increased up to 67 6 milling recovery which ultimately increases the market value fofana et al 2010 darzi naftchali et al 2017 in conclusion the application of mild awd safe awd during non critical stages like tillering to mid tillering and post anthesis stage can help improve the grain filling rate and the final yields however severe awd may reduce the final grain yield in some environments like light textured soil on the other hand overlapping of drying cycle of awd at critical stages stand establishment and panicle initiation to grain formation stage may reduce the final crop stand growth and assimilate translocation to sink and paddy yield 4 4 grain quality and heavy metals accumulation the grain quality may vary while switching from the conventional system to water saving rice production systems sarwar et al 2016 besides high water demands in the cf system the cf system reduces grain quality by accumulating heavy metals e g as zhao et al 2010 carrijo et al 2019 and hg rothenberg et al 2016 in grains the safe awd irrigation increased the grain protein contents milling recovery and grain yield while severe awd reduced the grain protein contents darzi naftchali et al 2017 similarly severe awd in the water saving rice system reduced photosynthetic rate translocation of photosynthates to sink and resulted in more electrolyte leakage and hormonal imbalance which led toward the inferior quality of produce jahan et al 2014 the wise application of awd technology not only maintained or increased the yield but also improved the quality of rice table 3 safe awd alters the phytohormonal levels particularly aba and indole acetic acid increased during drying event and increased cytokinin levels upon re watering which boost carbon mobilization toward sink grain from source to ensure the proper grain filling yang et al 2010 zhang et al 2012a wang et al 2016 norton et al 2017 similarly yang et al 2007 postulated that due to the awd irrigation technique a significant increase in head rice recovery and grain pulpiness was recorded with a decrease in kernel chalkiness application of fertilizers the use of micronutrients and the growing of drought tolerant varieties are important factors that are helpful to increase the efficiency of awd in boosting rice quality without sacrificing quality of the produce huang et al 2008 graham acquaah et al 2019 sarwar et al 2016 stated that micronutrient e g boron application along with water saving rice production systems not only increased yield but also improved the rice grain setting and quality in awd drought tolerant genotypes showed reduced abortive chalky opaque kernel and high protein contents that might be attributed to the positive correlation between total nitrogen uptake and grain protein content wang et al 2012 jabran et al 2017 rice cultivation on heavy textured soil using the awd irrigation technique was more tolerant because severe awd did not reduce n uptake in heavy textured soil paul and myers 1971 graham acquaah et al 2019 in conclusion mild awd safe awd may improve growth and phytohormonal balance which boosts carbon mobilization toward sink grain from the source to improve the grain quality 4 4 1 arsenic contamination bioavailability of as in rice grains increases under anaerobic soil condition due to the reduction of as5 to as3 that is present in irrigation water urban residue or due to application of as containing pesticides kumarathilaka et al 2018 as3 is highly mobile in soil and its uptake is mediated by reduction of fe3 to fe2 which release as to soil solution from iron plaques meharg and zhao 2012 and by silicon si uptake pathway because rice is naturally hyperaccumulator of si suriyagoda et al 2018 since cf system reduces the rice grain quality due to higher as uptake water saving rice irrigation practices awd reduce as accumulation in rice grains table 4 yang et al 2017 bakhat et al 2017 islam et al 2017 carrijo et al 2019 wang et al 2019 however mitigation of as uptake in rice grain by awd is highly variable e g from 0 to 90 yang et al 2017 carrijo et al 2018 variability in the reduction of as uptake was attributed to the timing of awd cyles i e crop stage and degree of dryness carrijo et al 2019 irrigation application according to awd alters the redox status and ph of the soil which influence the as mobilization and uptake takahashi et al 2004 li et al 2009 seyfferth et al 2018 carrijo et al 2019 under aerated conditions drying events as affinity increases toward soil mineral and iron plaque formation on the root surface so less as and iron are available to plants roberts et al 2011 talukder et al 2012 rinklebe et al 2016 norton et al 2017 while with the decrease in soil ph as bioavailability in soil is reduced honma et al 2016 safe awd reduces the as accumulation up to 25 while severe awd reduces the as up to 90 chou et al 2016 yang et al 2017 carrijo et al 2018 table 4 a higher degree of dryness 70kpa as in severe awd reduces the as contents in soil and rice grains due to demethylation along with the reduction of iron mn na calcium and molybdenum uptake somenahally et al 2011 linquist et al 2015b lahue et al 2016 rinklebe et al 2016 reid et al 2017 norton et al 2017 carrijo et al 2019 and an increase in zinc uptake wissuwa et al 2008 wang et al 2014a while in safe awd potential to reduce the as accumulation in the grain is lower because during the drying period the soil is not dried to such extent that decreases bioavailability of as norton et al 2017 carrijo et al 2018 carracelas et al 2019 carrijo et al 2019 concluded that severe awd in late season i e booting stage and post anthesis stage reduced the as significantly as compared to early season awd application in conclusion the awd in as contaminated soils may improve the grain quality of rice by reducing grain as contents depending upon the degree of soil drying and crop growth stage however severe awd in the late season post anthesis stage decreases as iron manganese molybdenum and increases the uptake of zinc 4 4 2 mercury methylation and other heavy metals in terrestrial ecosystems paddy fields serve as the primary pathway that exposes hg to humans and wildlife feng et al 2008 zhang et al 2010b tanner et al 2018 as paddy field are the hotspots place for hg methylation meng et al 2010 2011 rothenberg et al 2014 according to hg researcher s consensus the chief source of hg in rice plants is soil while the main source of inorganic hg in rice is ambient air hg qiu et al 2012 yin et al 2013 meng et al 2014 the factors affecting the biochemical cycle of hg in rice ecosystem are very complicated and include hg in irrigation water water management hg in the solid and liquid phase of paddy soil distribution and concentration of hg in ambient air eh of soil iron sulfur dissolved organic carbon and dry and wet deposition of hg ullrich et al 2001 benoit et al 2001 zhao et al 2016 rothenberg et al 2016 similarly according to zhao et al 2016 hg contents in the soil might be not directly influenced by soil organic matter and ph while fluctuation in the eh of paddy field s soil and water saturation levels during the rice season significantly influence the hg bioavailability for methylation process rothenberg and feng 2012 peng et al 2012 wang et al 2014a borin et al 2016 tanner et al 2018 the cf promotes the activities of anaerobic microbes and enhances the hg accumulation in rice grains rothenberg and feng 2012 rothenberg et al 2016 tanner et al 2018 under anaerobic conditions iron fleming et al 2006 and sulfate reducing bacteria facilitate methylation especially of inorganic hg rothenberg and feng 2012 wang et al 2014a liu et al 2014 tanner et al 2018 accumulated hg during the anaerobic conditions at the vegetative phase is readily translocated to rice grains at the grain filling stage meng et al 2011 so water management in paddy fields e g awd is the novel step to mitigate the hg accumulation in rice grain tanner et al 2018 intermittent flooding awd could hinder the hg solubilization and methylation in the rhizosphere of the paddy field ultimately it will result in reduced grain hg than cf table 5 peng et al 2012 the awd also can reduce iron and lead pb toxicity in rice grains cherif et al 2009 ashraf et al 2018 the uptake and translocation of pb content to different plant parts especially in grains is significantly reduced by applying awd irrigation either before flowering or after flowering ashraf et al 2018 in the case of chromium under cf conditions the concentration of cr vi in soil was decreased with the passage of time while under awd conditions it was increased owning to fluctuation in soil eh in contrast to grain as pb and hg the concentration of cr vi and copper cu increased under awd due to more uptake under oxic conditions and was translocated to rice grains xiao et al 2015 rinklebe et al 2016 similarly norton et al 2017 demonstrated that awd application increased the concentration of heavy metals as 36 7 80 8 cu 18 5 27 5 mn and 27 8 67 3 cadmium while the concentration of hg was decreased by 13 7 25 7 as compared to cf in conclusion awd has the potential to mitigate the as pb and hg uptake while increasing zn cr cu and na uptake similarly awd reduces the iron uptake in the iron toxic area but it could be a reason for the iron deficiency in normal soils 4 5 diseases and insect pest attack rice is a very susceptible crop toward diseases and insect pests due to succulence which ultimately affects rice yield and grain quality hasan et al 2016 it was observed that in awd the disease incidence and insect pest attack were less than the cf system chaboussou 2004 chapagain and yamaji 2010 hasan et al 2016 umesh et al 2017 rice plants grown under awd techniques are hardy and resistant to disease incidence e g golden snail bouman et al 2007 root knot false smut blast sheath rot and sheath blight hasan et al 2016 similarly rice crop performs better under awd irrigation technique as compared to cf and is less prone to insects attack e g stem borer rice bug brown plant hopper palis et al 2004 hasan et al 2016 lorica et al 2020 recommended awd as climate smart technology in africa and asia because awd did not enhance the rodent attack however the studies on the relationship between the paddy water environment and insect pests diseases are limited and further experimentation is needed to unravel these findings in conclusion awd has the potential to reduce insect pests and diseases of rice and could be part of strategies for integrated disease management and integrated pest management 4 6 weed infestation higher weed infestation results in lower yield with awd intermittent irrigation as compared to the cf system jabran et al 2015 umesh et al 2017 the cf rice system has inundation condition that suppresses most of the weeds while in awd irrigation drying event exposes the soil surface and increase the aeration that promotes the weed emergence kürschner et al 2010a b jabran and chauhan 2015 murugan et al 2019 however chapagain and yamaji 2010 and umesh et al 2017 reported that in transplanted rice it was worth noting that no extra time was required for weeding in awd plots as compared to cf plots it could be explained as the combined effect of shallow standing water for 10 15 days after transplanting and a single application of pre emergence herbicide chapagain and yamaji 2010 umesh et al 2017 similarly irrigation application according to the awd technique after canopy closure did not allow to enhance the weed proliferation rao et al 2007 field water depth of 2 5 cm or muddy conditions fully saturated conditions for 10 15 days after transplanting not only recover the seedling from transplanting shock but is also helpful for cultural control of weeds lampayan et al 2015b liang et al 2016 mubeen and jabran 2019 ishfaq et al 2020 contrarily early drying soon after the emergence of dsr or transplanting promote the weed infestation that leads towards yield reduction de vries et al 2010 in case of heavy weed infestation awd cycles should be practiced after 2 3 weeks to increase the pre germination herbicide efficacy and to supress the weed anonymous 2018 however the studies on the relationship between the awd irrigation and weed infestation are limited and further experimentation is needed to unravel these findings in conclusion early drying event of awd irrigation increased the weed infestation while application of awd cycle at 50 60 canopy closure not promoted weed infestation 5 water and nutrients use under awd system in plant water relations the most important controversy is either gas exchange is regulated chemically phytohormonal signaling from roots or shoots or hydraulically by changing turgor potential or roots or shoots the leaf water potential ψleaf mediates the aba effect on stomata opening tardieu and davies 1992 aba influence stomatal conductance either directly acting on guard cell or indirectly decreasing leaf hydraulic conductance pantin et al 2013 however consideration of both forms of regulation is useful as both could mediate the response of crops toward water saving techniques dodd et al 2015 any decrease in ψleaf may results in a decline in leaf growth and gas exchange blackman and davies 1985 henson et al 1989 dodd et al 2015 s li et al 2018 g li et al 2018 no doubt many species of plants isohydric are able to maintain ψleaf by closing stomata in response to soil drying tardieu and simonneau 1998 jabran et al 2017 however in context to soil drying ψleaf and gas exchange relationships in a single species can be negative positive or even may have no relationship kudoyarova et al 2007 suggesting that ψleaf cannot always mediate the stomatal closure dodd et al 2015 it was revealed that upon soil drying aba concentration in xylem increased 2 100 folds and cytokinin decreased significantly as compared to well watered plants perez alfocea et al 2011 chen et al 2016 mote et al 2018 in contrast to aba and cytokinin other xylem ionic phosphate nitrate sulfate calcium chloride na potassium and magnesium fluctuations were more inconstant goodger et al 2005 ernst et al 2010 this proposes that as compared to the concentration of xylem ions the concentration of xylem phytohormone shows a more constant measure upon soil drying dodd et al 2015 as a result of stomatal closure the rate of xylem sap flow was declined because xylem loading is not altered by the movement of phytohormones and ions from the root xylem lumen it suggests that upon soil drying under awd xylem sap concentration should increase jackson 1993 dodd 2005 while upon re wetting after soil drying the stomatal response can be delayed which decreases gas exchange jabran et al 2017 an elevated aba in xylem upon re wetting due to translocation from roots and increased concentration of zeatin riboside mediated stomatal opening and closure dörffling et al 1977 loewenstein and pallardy 2002 hansen and dörffling 2003 yang et al 2017 norton et al 2017 however in the case of severe awd membrane injury due to severe drying may be responsible for hindering ion transport across the plasma membrane guard cell after re wetting loewenstein and pallardy 2002 mild safe awd did not influence the chlorophyll contents negatively and hence increased photosynthetic rate due to enough soil moisture potential and a balance between light interception and its utilization jabran et al 2017 moreover higher photosynthetic rate and increased dry matter accumulation under awd was achieved due to high root metabolic activity that ensured the adequate amount of nutrients and water to the leaf mishra et al 2006 zhang et al 2009 jabran et al 2017 however severe awd 40 kpa not only decreased plant tissue water status zhang et al 2010a yang et al 2007 cabangon et al 2011 mahmood et al 2012 but also reduced chlorophyll content and increased electrolyte leakage that ultimately hampered the photosynthesis and dry matter production sengupta and majumder 2009 petrov et al 2012 jahan et al 2014 kar et al 2018 similarly to meet transpiration requirements and goal of higher yield under awd a sufficient number of roots should be available in the deeper soil layer sandhu et al 2017 kondo et al 2000 observed 0 08 ml day cm water extraction in roots exposed to moist soil of upland the same rate can be attained in a lowland rice system under awd irrigation such as deep roots within 25 35 cm depth take up more than 9 mm day where roots functioning rate is optimal linquist et al 2015b montazar et al 2017 5 1 leaf water contents leaf water content also vary under the awd system it was observed that during the soil drying period of the severe awd irrigation ψleaf was 0 56 to 1 23 mpa and it was significantly lower than those in the cf system 0 39 to 0 63 mpa due to restricted water uptake and transport of phytohormones to shoots davies et al 2011 chen et al 2013 while in the drying event of mild awd ψleaf was not significantly different from cf treatment chen et al 2013 upon re wetting of awd ψleaf is restored within hours in severe awd but the gas exchange was restored slowly and takes hours to days and this whole process is mediated by phytohormonal signaling from roots to shoots in the form of aba dodd et al 2015 it was observed that duration and severity of soil drying episode induce variation in ψleaf and xylem sap composition a plant having low ψleaf showed a quick recovery of leaf growth the concentration of xylem cytokinin its delivery and ψleaf upon re irrigating parent et al 2009 2010 zhang 2011 dodd et al 2015 recovery of ψleaf and leaf elongation upon rehydration could be explained due to increased hydraulic conductivity of roots parent et al 2009 dodd et al 2015 that enhance carbon mobilization due to higher aba concentration sandhu et al 2017 5 2 total water inputs and water use efficiency in rice fields cf of water to a greater depth would cause enormous water loss via seepage surface runoff percolation and evaporation wang et al 2010 tan et al 2013 contrarily awd has great potential to reduce water input lampayan et al 2015a along with decreasing irrigation cost and productivity enhancement alauddin et al 2020 for instance rice cultivation with awd irrigation management can reduce water inputs by 18 27 jabran et al 2015 similarly different other studies table 2 indicated that under different climatic and soil conditions adoption of awd reduced water input by 20 23 hasan et al 2016 14 18 belder et al 2004 31 44 liang et al 2016 by maintaining similar or increasing grain yield as compared to cf djaman et al 2018 xu et al 2020 while in other studies awd reduces water input by 23 27 oliver et al 2008 40 70 feng et al 2007 and 49 56 chu et al 2018 at the expense of yield reduction as compared to cf similarly a meta analysis of carrijo et al 2017 concluded that severe awd reduced water use by 33 4 at the expense of yield reduction while mild awd reduced the water inputs by 25 7 with increasing yield moreover research findings showed that under the awd technique the frequency of irrigation was reduced by 22 when compared to conventional rice production systems hasan et al 2016 reduction of water input in awd techniques can be ascribed to the absence of standing water because an optimum degree of soil moisture could be achieved through proliferated root systems and physiological changes in leaves due to partial soil drying martin vertedor and dodd 2011 in the absence of flooding conditions water input is reduced due to the reduction of seepage and percolation losses as soil hydrological properties govern these losses sanchez 1973 tabbal et al 2002 dong et al 2012 massey et al 2014 explained that during the wet season the adoption of the awd technique reduced total water input by 25 7 with the same or improved paddy yield it can be attributed as rain events during the drying cycle of awd can delay the re wetting cycle through re irrigating and also reducing the surface runoff losses while on the other hand implementation of awd seems too difficult under wet season because it s not possible to dry the paddy field in low lying fields under rainy seasons adhya et al 2014 belder et al 2004 stated that the awd technique does not imply forced drainage to reduce water and it can decrease total water use by 15 20 without affecting yield as compared to other crops the wue of the rice crop is much lower lin et al 2002 the adoption of the awd technique has the potential to increase wue by decreasing water input and increasing grain yield lampayan et al 2015a norton et al 2017 ishfaq et al 2020 darzi naftchali et al 2017 obtained higher wues 1 38 1 66 kg m 3 under awd technique as compared to earlier research studies 0 43 1 08 kg m 3 by zhang et al 2012b 0 56 0 82 kg m 3 by bulbul and rahman 2014 and 0 72 1 02 kg m 3 by yang et al 2017 the adoption of awd with timely management of nitrogen fertilizer increased wue because of higher yield ye et al 2013 irrigation efficiency is also increased under the awd technique that can irrigate an additional 14 mha area due to an increase of 10 irrigation efficiency umesh et al 2017 however increased wue under awd is attributed to more water saving as compared to cf yao et al 2012 in conclusion the adoption of awd not only enhances the wue but also has the potential to reduce the total water inputs along with increasing or maintaining yield however severe awd in som cases e g light textured sandy soil may sacrifice the yield in wake of saving water and improving wue 5 3 nutrient acquisition under awd soil chemistry fluctuates as the paddy fields transform from cf submerged condition to awd aerobic condition which could be explained by the effect of awd on grain and straw elemental concentration rinklebe et al 2016 norton et al 2017 fig 4 the changing drying and wetting events during awd can alter processes of nutrient cycling mineralization of nutrient and microbial dynamics which finally affects the nutrients use efficiency ye et al 2013 dodd et al 2015 sandhu et al 2017 moreover the adoption of awd reduces the non point pollution by reducing nutrient losses through runoff and drainage zhao et al 2012 liang et al 2013 2016 and ultimately more nutrients availability to crop for better productivity improved nutrient uptake under awd could be attributed to increased root proliferation and nutrient acquisition from deeper soil horizon because during drying cycle of awd the water level subside below the soil surface to a depth of 15 20 cm that limits the nutrient and water availability ndiiri et al 2012 norton et al 2017 pascual and wang 2017 it was observed that carbon gains macro and micronutrient availability uptake and their concentration in grains as well as in straw altered under awd as compared to cf price et al 2013 dodd et al 2015 due to fluctuation in soil moisture aeration soil ph and soil redox potential 5 3 1 macronutrients one of the key factors and main input that determines the yield of rice is nitrogen n application ju et al 2009 the efficiency of n fertilizer and its apparent recovery is on average only 33 due to inefficient and imbalance use of nitrogenous fertilizers garnett et al 2009 remaining n vanished through leaching in nitrate form volatilization to the atmosphere surface runoff or by microbial denitrification ju et al 2009 research studies indicated that as compared to cf under awd condition more n losses were observed in the form of nitrification and denitrification but these losses did not affect n uptake significantly dong et al 2012 cycling of anaerobic cf and aerobic awd conditions in the soil and elevated concentration of nh4 ions aggravate the nitrification and denitrification n losses nie et al 2015 moreover it was observed that under awd conditions the straw n concentration was reduced significantly as the awd changed the fate of n in paddy fields tan et al 2015 the reason behind the low accumulation of n in plants under awd was described as more n losses due to denitrification and volatilization tan et al 2013 in contrast some research studies indicated that awd practice did not boost losses of n due to the decrease in total n leaching and vertical nh4 n losses and consequently could not decline nue wang et al 2011 synergistic interaction is hypothesized between n fertilizer and soil moisture on crop growth wang et al 2013b if both n and water and are managed timely and properly such synergistic interaction can improve nue and crop yield yang 2015 djaman et al 2018 there are controversies that awd irrigation management enhance nitrogen use efficiency nue or not huda et al 2016 observed that the adoption of awd irrigation did not affect nue significantly low nue under awd based irrigation techniques is due to more n losses which ultimately reduces cumulative plant nitrogen uptake and nue zou et al 2007 in the case of alkaline soils moormann and van breemen 1978 reported more nitrogen losses due to ammonia volatilization as under aerobic conditions the volatilization losses are more dominant severe awd may aggravate the n losses but mild awd could not do so zhang et al 2009 similarly wang et al 2011 and chu et al 2016 reported that stimulation of n losses under awd irrigation depends on the extent of soil drying however n application before re wetting in awd irrigation increased nue due to n water synergetic interaction ye et al 2013 lampayan et al 2015b wang et al 2016 in the case of phosphorus p more p was available in soil solution under cf condition because the supplementary release of organic p occurs under anaerobic conditions young and ross 2001 it would be expected that iron and mn minerals redox sensitives release co precipitated or adsorbed p ions into the soil solution thus the availability of p in the drying event of awd is reduced due to which plant p status grains and straw is lower under awd as compared to cf condition norton et al 2017 it requires more phosphate fertilizer application under awd because the plant may require more p under awd especially in salt affected or acidic soils to increase n and p uptake awd drying events are recommended at 60 canopy cover so that the basally applied n and p fertilizers are taken up by plants and n losses are minimized through coupled nitrification denitrification lahue et al 2016 regarding potassium k both rate and type are important for rice under awd water management ullah and datta 2018 application of k 80 kg ha 1 increases proline synthesis which is directly linked with severe awd tolerance by enhancing the transpiration zain and ismail 2016 under water limited conditions increased the application of k enhances the water deficit tolerance plant growth photosynthesis as well as the yield of crops pervez et al 2004 increasing rates of k under awd significantly enhances the root proliferation of rice to uptake the nutrients and water ullah and datta 2018 and finally help the plant to withstand under water limited environment by closing the stomata and increasing nue and wue egilla et al 2005 marschner 2012 moreover k act as a transporter that circulates the food all over the plant part reduces the sweetness of the leaves thereby reduces insect pest attack wang et al 2013a in sum the reduced basal dose of n and application of n before re irrigation in awd will increase nue and reduce the n losses moreover awd may require extra p and k fertilizer application to increase the awd performance 5 3 2 micronutrients irrigation application according to awd may increase the concentration of some micronutrients in the soil solution as well as in plants while the concentration of some other nutrients may decrease price et al 2013 for example under awd irrigation technique zinc availability as well as uptake and concentration in rice grains was increased wissuwa et al 2008 wang et al 2014b norton et al 2017 demonstrated that awd application increased micronutrient concentration in grains as 18 5 27 5 mn 36 7 80 8 copper while the concentration of calcium iron and sulfur was decreased by 6 3 8 7 10 7 15 5 and 4 2 15 4 respectively as compared to cf the higher nutrient concentration under awd could be attributed to the altering redox potential and higher root metabolic activity that enables the plant to acquire more nutrients and water from greater depth and hence supports the high photosynthetic rate zhang et al 2009 in iron fe toxic coastal area of asia fe toxicity was lower under awd because fe in the soil is usually found in fe 2 form either as a sulfate salt or chelated cherif et al 2009 under aerobic conditions of awd the fe 2 is converted to fe 3 and remains unavailable to plant for uptake du laing et al 2009 rinklebe et al 2016 moreover the changing eh is the strong motive behind the low accumulation of fe in grains under awd and may require the foliar application of iron sulphate in normal soil slamet loedin et al 2015 in contrast zn availability as well as uptake and translocation was higher under the aerobic condition of awd because under cf irrigation zn availability was lower due to precipitation as zinc sulfide or carbonate mixture and both zinc sulfide and carbonate mixture are insoluble forms bostick et al 2001 wang et al 2014b shifting in rice cultivation from cf to water saving production systems awd or aerobic may alter the nutrient uptake e g boron that leads to the increased percentage of unfilled grains and reduced yield sarwar et al 2016 boron availability is reduced under aerobic conditions in paddy fields due to higher eh and fluctuation in ph gao et al 2002 moreover under the aerobic condition of awd higher oh concentrations due to more nitrification leads towards an increased soil ph the higher ph and reduced mobility of b under drying cycles ultimately reduce the b availability and uptake gao et al 2006 that requires foliar application of b in this context b application either basil or foliar in water saving technique awd enhances the pollen viability and total dry matter accumulation sarwar et al 2016 sarwar et al 2016 also observed that the foliar application of boron in a water saving production system at the reproductive stage pi stage reduced the percentage of the sterile and opaque kernel while the percentage of the normal kernel was increased in conclusion the awd system has the potential to increase the availability and uptake of zn and copper however aerobic conditions and higher eh hampered the iron availability and uptake to rice that require the foliar or basal application of iron 6 emission of greenhouse gases in awd system the environmentally friendly rice production requires maintaining the higher rice yield coupled with a reduction in the negative impact on the environment alauddin et al 2020 according to an estimate 10 12 of worldwide anthropogenic ghgs emissions come from agricultural activities smith et al 2007 the emissions of ghgs from agricultural soils are contributing as co2 60 ch4 15 and n2o 5 as compared to co2 over a 100 years time span the gwp of n2o and ch4 is 298 and 34 times more than co2 respectively myhre et al 2013 in context to ch4 emissions rice paddies are most important as 75 of the world s rice is practiced on continuously flooded soils for most of the crop season neue 1997 ipcc 2007 annual ch4 emissions from rice field account to be 31 112 tg year 1 and it is contributing 15 26 of total anthropogenic emission denman et al 2007 diffusion ebullition mechanisms and transport via plant aerenchyma are routes of subsequent ch4 emission from soil to atmosphere krüger et al 2001 in rice paddies under cf conditions the presence of more organic substrates and anaerobic conditions provides an ideal environment for methanogenic bacteria denman et al 2007 the microbiological processes in the soil leading towards ch4 formation are governed by many other biochemical and physical factors eh of soil being most important yu et al 2001 in soil obligate anaerobes methanogenic archaea can only perform optimally in the low eh of soil cicerone and oremland 1988 thus the eh of soil and ch4 emission are inversely related yu et al 2001 usually methanogenic bacteria require eh of soil less than 150 mv to produce ch4 liang et al 2016 it is recommended that ch4 emission can be controlled by changing the metabolic activity and community structure of methanogenic bacteria like more oxidized conditions under aerobic rice or awd management watanabe et al 2010 in paddy fields nutrients and water management are deriving agents for ghgs emissions ipcc 2014 the awd system significantly reduces ghgs emissions of ch4 without sacrificing yield li et al 2006 hosen 2007 wassmann et al 2010 montzka et al 2011 chirinda et al 2017 when compared with cf the awd has the potential to reduce gwp ch4 n2o by 45 90 linquist et al 2015b pandey et al 2014 vu et al 2015 islam et al 2018 similarly another common practice is midseason drainage which reduces ch4 emissions by 10 wassmann et al 2000 considering the importance of awd regarding reduction in ghgs emissions in the usa the american carbon registry approved a methodology voluntary emission reductions in rice management systems it allows the farmer communities to acquire carbon credits on the adoption of water saving technologies in rice production including awd umesh et al 2017 although the effect of awd on the emission of ch4 is significant however there is a trade off with enhanced emission of n2o zou et al 2007 liao et al 2020 increased emission of n2o was reported with a reduction of ch4 emission especially relative to water management in the rice systems hou et al 2000a b zheng et al 2000 stated that awd mid season drainage creates more oxic conditions in the root zone which promotes n2o production an intermediate product of either nitrification or denitrification earlier studies stated that emission of n2o contributes much lesser than ch4 emission to the gwp kurosawa et al 2007 itoh et al 2011 pittelkow et al 2013 but many field based studies indicated that under awd system a significant amount of n2o fluxes are emitted dittert et al 2002 yuan et al 2008 johnson beebout et al 2009 xu et al 2015 these n2o fluxes from water saving practices offset the benefits gained by reducing ch4 emission but still reduces the net gwp as compared to cf yuan et al 2008 higher n2o fluxes also occur due to the overuse of nitrogenous fertilizers mosier and zhu 2000 or coinciding with the drying cycle of awd with more n availability in paddy soils aerobic and anaerobic cycles of awd in paddy fields enhance the n losses due to the availability of more ammonium ions and their intensified nitrification or denitrification processes tan et al 2015 in conclusion the adoption of awd water management has the potential to reduce the ch4 emission and net global warming potential but the imbalance use of nitrogenous fertilizer may aggravate the n2o emission table 6 7 adoption and economics of the awd system the adoption of any agricultural technology by end users farmers relies on its economic viability easiness and its impacts on the environment rice plays a vital role in the economy of many countries throughout the world pandey et al 2010 chauhan et al 2017 rice cultivation using the awd technique of irrigation enhances the economic viability of the system lampayan et al 2015b pearson et al 2018 in field based study the adoption of awd increased the profit by 38 42 due to reduced water inputs in pump irrigation systems i e tube well irrigation and increased yield kürschner et al 2010a b lampayan et al 2015b similarly palis et al 2004 and lampayan et al 2004 indicated that in deep well irrigation system awd the farmers obtained increased profit from 0 1 8 due to lower labor costs no yield penalty and 5 30 water saving alam et al 2009 and lampayan et al 2015b highlighted that farmer community acknowledges that the adoption of awd techniques under dsr not only saves labor water and time but also reduces the total expenditure including reduced use of fuel 20 25 and irrigation cost 12 15 in bangladesh experts claimed that the adoption of the awd technique on a national level could reduce the cost of irrigation by 56 4 million euros by saving electricity or 78 8 million euros by reducing the expenses incurred on fuel miah and sattar 2009 under such conditions awd safe technique being labor saving cost effective and environmentally safe is welcomed by farmers in china northwest bangladesh and many other countries nalley et al 2015 mainuddin et al 2019 hasan et al 2016 explained that in the formal discipline another indicator used for cost benefit analysis is the benefit cost ratio bcr the bcr of conventional rice production is quite lower 1 01 than the bcr of awd 1 19 moreover it is found that the cost of weeding irrigation fertilizers and pesticides was lower in awd as compared to farmers practice furthermore with respect to the environment the emission of co2 is much lower in the awd technique as less fuel is consumed to uplift groundwater alam et al 2009 thus awd helps to sustain the level of the groundwater table therefore for sustainable rice cultivation farmers can comfortably implement awd the awd is recommended for large scale adoption in china bangladesh philippines vietnam indonesia india laos myanmar and thailand due to well documented agronomic economic and environmental benefits lampayan et al 2004 2013 sibayan et al 2010 palis et al 2004 palis et al 2014 rejesus et al 2011 2013 similarly safe awd is now recommended practice in many regions or countries including the philippines rejesus et al 2013 lampayan et al 2013 bangladesh palis et al 2014 vietnam rejesus et al 2013 and myanmar lampayan et al 2013 besides this large scale adoption of awd is on the minuscule area key limitations to the large scale adoption of awd include the complicated relationship between agricultural and socioeconomic systems water pricing and water availability as well as approaches to overcome these constrictions e g incentivisation which are likely to be common or sometimes different to many countries and regions pearson et al 2018 in sum awd is an economically viable irrigation technique because of having a potential of increasing yield saving water labour and fuel consumption while minimizing the harm to the climate 8 conclusions alternate wetting and drying is a promising profitable and ecofriendly technology for rice cultivation across the globe the efforts are underway to commercialize it in water scarce areas the adoption of mild safe awd reduces the total water inputs as compared to cf while maintaining or increasing the yield however severe awd reduces the total water inputs at the expense of yield reduction the practice of awd on non critical growth stages and heavy textured soil results in higher water saving and higher yield while awd practice on critical growth stages and light textured soil results in yield reduction depending upon the degree of soil drying and crop growth stages awd has a potential to improve the plant physiology and grain quality by altering the phytohormonal concentration and reducing the heavy metals arsenic molybdenum lead and mercury uptake while increasing zinc and copper uptake however under water limited conditions awd may require the extra application of phosphorus potassium and foliar application of iron and boron the plants grown under awd irrigation are more resistant against insect pest and disease attack so it could be as part of strategies for integrated disease and pest management however the early drying event of awd irrigation increases the weed infestation while the application of the awd cycle at 50 60 canopy closure did not promote the weed infestation the reduced basal dose of n and application of n before re irrigation in awd will not only increase the nue but also reduce the n losses ghg emission and net global warming potential undoubtedly a trade off between ch4 and n2o exists when shifting from flooding to saturated or drying condition nonetheless a wise and judicious application of nitrogenous fertilizers and irrigation management on the basis of other allied tools leaf colour chart and soil testing can reduce the global warming potential significantly large scale adoption of the awd system is being challenged due to farmer s community perception as they conceived it as yield penalty technique and they experience heavy weeds flushes due to changing soil water regimes full incentives cannot be achieved along with only adopting awd but an integrated approach is required to enhance the resource use efficiency and overall profitability at the farmer field these challenges require site specific technology and extension work to change the farmer s perception integrated weed management practices for weed control and use of all resources according to soil type and farm situation

10508,global warming and declining water resources are threatening the sustainability of rice production and global food security conventional continuously flooded system cf of rice production is a

et al 2006 umesh et al 2017 bhatt et al 2019 ishfaq et al 2020 the conventional rice production system which involves the transplanting of 30 35 days old seedling from nursery to field is challenged

based irrigation using tensiometers drum seeding and using short duration rice cultivars can also help in water saving in rice cultivation bhatt et al 2019 among water saving techniques dsr and awd are the attractive options and are being practiced in different parts of the world tuong et al 2005 farooq et al 2011 however in light textured soils using dsr and awd options have not been successful due to more water inputs and fluctuation of nutrient supply chakraborty et al 2017 adoption of water saving techniques in rice not only increase the paddy yield but also increase carbon sequestration helps in resource water labor energy and time saving and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases ghgs irri 2009 yang et al 2017 the potential benefits of awd system include requires 23 33 less water

the adoption of awd system has contributed to significantly reduce the global warming potential gwp and water use li et al 2011 mazza et al 2016 although the reports on irrigation management to reduce flooding in rice and its effects on rice yield are still contrasting adhya et al 2014 for instance there are reports of increase yang et al 2004 liang et al 2016 jabran et al 2016 and decrease oliver et al 2008 lagomarsino et al 2016 chu et al 2018 in yield under awd system than the cf system these contrasting results indicate need to optimize and implement site specific irrigation management options considering soil properties drainage frequency duration of flooding cycles as well as variety adaptability mazza et al 2016 a combination of water saving production systems and water saving irrigation systems may help increase water productivity water use efficiency and economic returns by reducing the gwp although a number of studies have specifically focused on the effect of awd on grain yield water use efficiency nitrogen use efficiency nue and ghgs emissions nevertheless a comprehensive review on the influence of the awd system of rice production on soil health crop quality and environmental sustainability is still lacking to comprehend this approach as an alternative to traditional flooded rice system this review provides a contemporary synthesis of existing data regarding the performance of awd in relation to different soil properties and crop growth stage awd influence on rice yield and quality heavy metals accumulation and emission of ghgs emission in paddy fields 2 overview of awd and its development under awd fields are subjected to alternating flooding and drying rather than continuous flooding throughout the crop season zhang et al 2009 fields are re flooded when soil surface attains the aerobic state as water is allowed to subside via percolation and evapotranspiration it means that instead of keeping the paddy field continuously flooded the paddy fields are subjected to dry wet cycles the international rice research institute irri developed awd in the 1970s bouman and tuong 2001 belder et al 2004 which has been widely adopted on heavy textured soil in china as mid season drainage more than 12 mha area each year zhang et al 2010a ye et al 2013 and has been accepted in several asian countries e g india bangladesh vietnam and philippines kukal et al 2005 bouman 2007 and usa carrijo et al 2017 besides china the implementation of awd in other countries is limited kürschner et al 2010a b lampayan et al 2015a cabangon et al 2016 several factors such as climatic conditions degree of mechanization quantity and availability of irrigational water and rainfall soil type and success in maintaining or increasing yield are major constraints in worldwide adoption of the awd van den berg et al 2007 wassmann et al 2009 though there are numerous potential benefits of using the awd irrigation technique fig 1 but it is not easy for farmers to use it practically as without developing simple irrigation indices it is hard for them to choose the best time for irrigation application irri and institute for agro environmental science niaes japan established a set of easy guidelines for awd application using a field water polyvinyl chloride pvc tube as a device to monitor the field water level minamikawa et al 2015 the awd comprises of three basic key elements 1 shallow flooding for the first 2 weeks after seeding or transplanting to recover seedlings from transplanting shock and to suppress weed emergence liang et al 2013 2 thin layer 2 3 cm of standing water from panicle initiation pi to the end of flowering because this duration is very sensitive toward water deficit and 3 awd cycle during all other growth periods bouman et al 2006 yang et al 2017 the awd system ensures supply of the physiological water demand of rice by controlling water supply and enables to cut short the irrigation total water input in awd implementation threshold level duration of drying periods and frequency of irrigation can be decided by a attaining certain soil water potential threshold level using tensiometers b re flooding after a fixed number of non flooded days 4 5 days and 6 8 days for lighter and heavy soils respectively as adopted in some region of china li and barker 2004 c after the appearance of cracking in the soil surface d visual symptoms of water shortage indicated by plant appearance e when the water level in field drops to a certain limit below the soil surface peng and bouman 2007 and f technique of ditch irrigation making shallow ditches at 2 m distance in rice field saves 40 50 water inputs but it is cumbersome to make and maintain ditches guo et al 2004 fig 2 in awd fields are subjected to periodic cycles of wetting and drying and these cycles are closely linked with the number of factors including the soil texture soil water potential plant water status and watehr elements bouman 2007 shao et al 2014 the field water tube developed by irri can be used to invigilate the water level beneath the soil surface half perforated field water tubes can be made by using bamboo pvc pipe tin cans or even plastic bottles having a diameter of 10 20 cm the use of perforated field water tubes enables farmers to monitor the water table easily irrigation to a depth of around 5 cm is applied and then the farmers wait until the perched water table falls to a certain limit beneath the soil surface due to percolation drainage and evapotranspiration the fields are then re irrigated when field water level fwl reaches 15 cm in water pipes below the soil surface and reflooding at this fwl is termed as safe awd bouman et al 2006 threshold level at safe awd increases or maintains the yield with water saving of 15 30 as at this threshold level roots of plants are still able to acquire sufficient water from the saturated soil and perched groundwater for growth and development farms are encouraged to implement the safe awd technique during vegetative growth tillering to pi and then at the grain filling stage lampayan et al 2015a based on soil water potential or field water level awd is categorized as safe awd mild moderate awd and severe awd fig 3 among these safe awd is now recommended and increasingly adopted by farmers in various asian countries including india vietnam philippines and bangladesh lin et al 2013 palis et al 2014 lampayan et al 2015a sandhu et al 2017 kar et al 2018 under safe awd practice soil water regimes are shifted from flooding to non flooding saturated or unsaturated conditions tan et al 2015 and drying periods can vary from 1 to more than 10 days depending upon soil textural class and soil organic matter bouman et al 2006 ye et al 2013 the number of drying events their duration water saving and level of flooding depend on the climatic conditions availability of water soil type percolation and evapotranspiration water losses and crop growth stage bouman et al 2006 chu et al 2014 the awd technique is being used under transplanted sandhu et al 2017 kar et al 2018 ishfaq et al 2020 as well as the dsr systems carrijo et al 2017 ishfaq et al 2020 the application of water saving techniques like awd or mid drainage in both water intensive conventional flooded puddled transplanted rice system cf trp or water saving system dsr reduce the water input and presumed negative influence on growth physiology and yield of rice however mishra 2012 and jabran et al 2017 reported that shifting from cf to unsaturated conditions awd or aerobic rice did not affect the growth of rice plants in conclusion overall awd reduces water inputs by 26 as compared to cf however in lieu of maintaining yield the mild awd reduce water inputs by 23 carrijo et al 2017 3 soil properties and awd performance alternate wetting and drying cycles and its effect on crop performance and final yields depend on soil texture soil ph soil organic carbon soil microbes and the climatic conditions sandhu et al 2017 norton et al 2017 the shift in cultivation practice from cf to aerobic soil awd condition causes variations in soil aeration soil water contents and nutrient availability due to mineralization timsina and connor 2001 ye et al 2013 fig 4 tan et al 2013 described that the exchange of air between atmosphere and soil is improved under awd practice which leads to mineralization of soil organic matter and soil n immobilization is inhibited due to adequate oxygen supply this helps to improve soil fertility and the availability of essential nutrients for the growth of rice plants dong et al 2012 according to carrijo et al 2017 when fields were irrigated at fwl of 15 cm soil water potential swp reached to 20 kpa similarly when fields were irrigated at fwl of 20 cm swp reached to 20 kpa a thin layer of standing water or even without standing water on the soil surface in paddies led to increased penetration of oxygen into the soil which oxidizes the soil organic carbon to co2 beside ch4 and eventually lowers the ch4 emissions sun et al 2016 in acidic soil ph 6 5 the performance of awd irrigation in terms of yield is comparatively better than soil having ph 7 due to many reasons carrijo et al 2017 firstly presence of a higher percentage of exchangeable sodium na in soil having ph 8 causes formation of impermeable soil layer and disintegration of soil particles abrol et al 1985 this may be a constraint to plant growth and development in awd conditions where roots are deeper but may not affect plants in the cf system where rice has a shallow root system yang et al 2004 secondly na toxicity problem is rare under the cf system due to the leaching of na ions from the root zone under the drying cycle of awd higher uptake of na may occur due to higher availability of na ions abrol et al 1985 which makes rice less tolerant for na toxicity under the awd system thirdly ammonia volatilization in alkaline soil in drying events of awd may enhance the nitrogen losses moormann and van breemen 1978 so the practice of severe awd in alkaline soil results in more yield reduction than practice of severe awd in acidic soil carrijo et al 2017 the awd irrigation can reduce irrigation water requirements by 50 but at the same time it may increase the electrical conductivity ec value of field water in contrast with cf nhan et al 2016 increased soil ec might be attributed to increase in mineralization and concentration of dissolved ions that is lower under cf condition due to dilution effect adviento borbe et al 2006 similarly in cf fields soil redox potential eh remain lower throughout the rice season due to the reduced conditions while under awd fields soil eh remains higher xiao et al 2015 takahashi et al 2004 recorded analogous trends during cf in the field and xu et al 2008 in greenhouse studies and suggested that o2 deprivation is improbable to oxidize the bulk soil under cf conditions lower soil eh in cf induces reduction of methanogens ferric iron fe iii chromium cr vi manganese mn iv and sulfate xiao et al 2015 under awd irrigation soil eh decreased instantly after flooding due to deprivation of o2 that led to increase in reduction reactions while soil eh increased again from drying to the next wetting due to increased o2 supply under awd conditions soil eh may increase from 291 mv to 142 mv in oxi soils and from 254 mv to 189 mv in phaeozem soils xiao et al 2015 fluctuating soil eh under awd is an important factor to mitigate the cr xiao et al 2015 and as toxicity in rice grains carrijo et al 2018 islam et al 2019 sellathurai et al 2016 postulated that dry spells of short duration may not reduce the soil organic matter som while long duration dry spells significantly reduce the som according to birch 1958 the soil carbon mineralization is increased after flooding and due to activities of methanogenic bacteria the available carbon is converted to ch4 while under short duration dry spell the ch4 emission is hampered which reduces the loss of som in contrast dry spell of longer duration reduces the som that can be attributed to the abundance of root biomass a higher rate of n mineralization of som due to aerobic degradation which are highly correlated kader et al 2013 application of awd cycles not only influences the activity of soil microbes and water uptake but also affect the nutrient cycling by microbes and the availability of nutrients to plants dodd et al 2015 aanaerobic soil conditions under cf causes reduction in the population and diversity of soil microbes than the aerobic soil awd management kassam et al 2011 aerobic conditions of a dry spell of awd are healthy for increasing soil microbes which enhance the mineralization and subsequent release of nutrients in the rhizosphere the soil properties vary under awd irrigation which ultimately affects the performance of rice in the awd rice system carrijo et al 2017 the practice of awd irrigation in soils having soc 1 perform better because soc is correlated with aggregate stability low bulk density improved soil structure and high porosity all of which enhance the water availability to plants and also improve the water holding capacity murphy 2014 in contrast implementation of awd irrigation in alkaline soil having low soc may not yield well carrijo et al 2017 similarly soil texture is one of the most important factors that help in deciding the duration of awd cycles which can vary from 1 to 10 days depending upon soil texture sandhu et al 2017 for instance in clayey soils california rice soils 15 of total applied water is lost through percolation and it requires more time to achieve required soil moisture potential linquist et al 2015a whereas in sandy loam soils the percolation losses are 51 and the required drying stage is achieved in a short time span sharma et al 2002 besides irrigation scheduling the quantum of irrigation water and irrigation command area are also influenced by soil texture for example frequent and light irrigation is required for coarse textured soils while fine textured soils require heavy irrigation at extended intervals darzi naftchali et al 2017 carrijo et al 2018 the aspect that how soil texture influences the relative performance of awd needs further studies in conclusion heavy textured soil clayey require less frequent heavy irrigation because field water depth subsides slowly while in light textured soil frequent and light irrigations are required so more number of awd cycle are recorded under light textured soil than the heavy textured soil moreover in light textured soil severe awd does not yield well than that of on heavy textured soil 4 rice growth phenology reproduction grain filling and yield formation under awd system 4 1 root and shoot growth the awd system helps to improve the growth and development of root and shoot yang and zhang 2010 thakur et al 2011 root proliferation may be restricted when the awd technique is practiced in fields with an impermeable soil layer which may restrict plant root and shoot growth yang et al 2004 under such conditions oxygen supply to roots could be enhanced by a sub surface drainage system kerbiriou et al 2013 application of mild awd conditions along with the normal application of nitrogenous fertilizes increased the root and shoot growth as well as root density and biomass kato and okami 2010 mishra and salokhe 2010 pascual and wang 2017 the drying cycle of awd facilitates the root proliferation which ensures higher uptake of nutrient and water higher leaf area index and increased leaf elongation rate dobermann and fairhurst 2000 kirk 2004 higher root hydraulic conductivity of deep roots is critical for water and nutrient extraction from the rhizosphere that ensures optimal water for better growth ludlow and muchow 1990 parent et al 2009 pascual and wang 2017 after re irrigation the plants responses quickly and increase the net assimilation rate darzi naftchalia et al 2017 the leaf has a positive correlation with net assimilation rate zain and ismail 2016 and paddy yield has a significant relation with the leaf area index li et al 2014 anbumozhi et al 1998 reported that severe awd results in root decay leaf discoloration and ultimately reduces the shoot growth and yield hence there is a need for awd specifications for its implementation in different parts of the world severe drying of awd also reduces relative water contents inhibits cell division elongation and cell wall thickening maheswari et al 2007 kima et al 2015 reduces evapotranspiration and chlorophyll contents mostajean and eichi 2009 kima et al 2014 moreover it also decreases total carotenoids cha um et al 2010 increases electrolyte leakage jahan et al 2014 pigment degradation reduces photosynthetic rate tuna et al 2010 leaf cell expansion and translocation of assimilates under severe drying event davantgar et al 2009 awd irrigation brings physiological and biochemical modifications in rice plants sun et al 2012 chu et al 2018 physiological plant adaptations under awd irrigation are alteration in phytohormonal synthesis dodd et al 2015 pascual and wang 2017 increased the metabolic activity of roots thakur et al 2011 yang et al 2017 chu et al 2018 and higher photosynthetic rate mishra et al 2006 zhang et al 2009 jabran et al 2017 chu et al 2018 the drying cycle of awd causes more accumulation of abscisic acid aba in roots due to enhanced root aba biosynthesis but translocation of aba to shoots was hampered due to decreased water uptake dodd et al 1996 belimov et al 2009 dodd et al 2015 yang et al 2017 xylem aba was increased following re irrigation in the leaf due to translocation from roots pérez pérez and dodd 2015 norton et al 2017 the factors influencing the duration and rate of aba upon re irrigation include the accumulated aba pool previously dried roots water uptake dynamics aba efflux and aba losses via the metabolism of roots dodd et al 2015 upon re wetting higher root water potential may increase the concentration of cytokinin in the xylem hansen and dörffling 2003 zhang et al 2010a mote et al 2018 in comparison to continuous flooding system under awd re wetting event cytokinin levels i e zeatin z zeatin riboside zr is increased in roots as well as in leaves both z zr are very active cytokinin and plays an important role in delaying senescence and boosting cell division del pozo et al 2005 similarly increased activity of enzymes involved in ammonia assimilation and metabolism of plant n was observed by sun et al 2012 in case of root indole acetic acid show no change under re wetting period after mild drying but increased by 25 under severe soil drying event dodd et al 2015 these physiological changes in roots delayed the leaf senescence and enhanced crop performance yang et al 2012 irrigation application according to awd also enhanced the rice performance by altering leaf angle davies et al 2011 increased leaf area duration reducing unproductive tillers and increasing the productive tillers yang and zhang 2010 howell et al 2015 kima et al 2015 norton et al 2017 moreover as a result of increased vegetative growth the canopy structure was also improved sandhu et al 2017 4 2 awd performance at different phenological stages compared to other crops rice is more sensitive to water deficit at critical stages e g stand establishment panicle initiation anthesis and grain filling stages sarvestani et al 2008 davantgar et al 2009 mote et al 2018 jones 2004 highlighted that different plants respond to water deficit in a complex way and numerous mechanisms are assumed by plants when they come across water deficit at different growth stages e g closure of the stomata phenotypic plasticity etc with respect to phenological stages of rice implementing awd at the reproductive stage caused yield reduction in comparison to awd implementation at the vegetative stage carrijo et al 2017 mote et al 2018 at mid tillering awd implementation increases the translocation of photosynthates to the developing panicles by altering the source sink relationship and reduces the competition with panicle development davantgar et al 2009 pascual and wang 2017 the overlapping of the awd drying cycle and panicle initiation stage heading or flowering stage resulted in a reduction in the number of panicles per hill and numbers of kernels per panicle which results in reduced grain yields pascual and wang 2017 according to lu et al 2000 soil water potential 10 or 20 kpa until the reproductive stage did not affect dry matter production significantly lu et al 2000 at the reproductive stage irrigation deficit resulted in a higher unfilled grain percentage kumar et al 2006 pascual and wang 2017 ishfaq et al 2020 sarvestani et al 2008 and mote et al 2018 observed that awd application at booting stage delayed flowering and seed set moreover at the flowering stage the drying cycle of awd resulted in flower abortion and grain abscission davantgar et al 2009 pascual and wang 2017 4 3 grain filling and yield formation early flowering spikelets exhibit similar grain phytohormonal concentration and rate of grain filling in awd as well as in cf but late flowering spikelets exhibit marked differences in grain phytohormonal concentrations under awd irrigation technique zhang et al 2010a the higher concentration of aba in grain was observed under awd during the grain filling stage but fluctuation was noted in the concentration of cytokinin grain along with awd cycles and soil drying severity zhang et al 2010a yang et al 2017 mote et al 2018 re wetting after mild drying enhanced the concentration of cytokinin grain but decreased grain cytokinin concentration was observed after severe drying pascual and wang 2017 increased cytokinin concentration in inferior spikelets upon re wetting time enhances the sink strength by increasing cell division of endosperm and grain filling rate zhang et al 2009 and upregulating the gene expression of the enzyme encoding sucrose to starch pathway enzyme i e cell wall invertase werner et al 2008 altering phytohormonal signaling not only influences leaf gas exchange but also alters the grain filling rate due to activities of enzymes involved in sucrose to starch conversion and enhanced photosynthetic rate zhang et al 2012a yang et al 2017 jabran et al 2017 chu et al 2018 moreover under mild soil drying at the grain filling stage the elevated aba level could enhance the remobilization of assimilates pre stored in leaves and stem the grain filling rate of inferior spikelets hinder stomatal conductance and hence increase harvest index yang and zhang 2010 marcaida et al 2014 jabran et al 2017 while severe awd at grain filling stage hampered the grain filling might be due to the hindrance of assimilates translocation to sink due to water deficit pascual and wang 2017 at post anthesis stage awd implication increased grain filling rate significantly which is attributed to increased root oxidation activity photosynthetic rate flag leaf and activity of sucrose to starch conversion enzymes sucrose synthase sus phosphate synthase starch synthase sts adenosine diphosphate glucose pyro phosphorylase adpg and starch branching enzyme sbe during grain filling stage zhang et al 2008 2012a chu et al 2015 2018 during drying cycle of awd increased aba concentration enhanced the translocation of photosynthates toward developing grains due to increased activities of enzymes in stem sus and phosphate synthase sts adpg and sbe enzymes in rice kernel zhang et al 2009 chen et al 2016 it is believed that the re synthesis of sucrose is mediated by sucrose phosphate synthase sps wardlaw and willenbrink 1994 chen et al 2016 during soil drying of mild awd the aba concentration is elevated and in response sps activity is also increased chen et al 2016 increased sps not only maintains the photosynthates flux from leaves to grains but also increases the accumulation of disaccharide in response to soil drying isopp et al 2000 adoption of awd technique may increase ye et al 2013 liu et al 2013 chu et al 2014 norton et al 2017 or maintain grain yields linquist et al 2015a liang et al 2016 as compared to continuous flooding cf rice production system table 2 however yield may be lower than the cf system in some cases yadav et al 2012 linquist et al 2015a inconsistency in grain yield under awd might be attributed to management practices and climatic conditions among management practices experimental conditions soil organic carbon soil type establishment methods number of drains un availability of awd tools soil drying threshold level groundwater table and soil hydrological conditions may influence the final goals of awd and are also responsible for such inconsistencies in awd performance belder et al 2004 yao et al 2012 carrijo et al 2017 moreover agronomic practices genetic makeup of genotytpes used and climatic conditions may affect the final yield moormann and van breemen 1978 stated that awd application in alkaline soils reduced the final yields that might be attributed to more n losses via ammonia volatilization as n uptake is reduced under non flooded conditions of alkaline soil among the soil drying threshold levels safe awd can be practiced in different environments without sacrificing yield linquist et al 2015a lampayan et al 2015a liang et al 2016 yang et al 2017 carrijo et al 2018 while under certain circumstance severe awd does not affect the yield carrijo et al 2017 in terms of yield reduction it is more important at which crop growth stage awd cycles are applied and to how much soil should be dried when irrigation is to be applied li et al 2019 under mild safe awd the reason for no yield penalty under most circumstances beside sandy soils is the field water level that is not allowed to drop down below 15 cm from the soil surface or swp remains 20 kpa while yield is reduced up to 22 under severe awd where the soil is dried beyond 20 kpa as compared to cf carrijo et al 2017 similarly yields reduction by 8 was noted when the awd cycle was imposed during the whole crop season while awd cycle exposure at only vegetative stage resulted in no yield reduction application of awd cycles at critical growth stages may reduce the yield significantly chidthaisong et al 2018 sun et al 2019 that is attributed to grain abscission flower abortion a higher percentage of sterile spikelets and unfilled grains under severe awd davantgar et al 2009 norton et al 2017 pascual and wang 2017 however in awd techniques the yield is maintained by the deep and extensive root system and availability of moisture at deeper soil layer chu et al 2018 pascual and wang 2017 carrijo et al 2018 similarly a significant source of water may be achieved through a shallow water table or the rise of capillary water to the root zone bouman et al 2006 tan et al 2014 a higher yields potential under awd might be attributed to more effective tillers yang and zhang 2010 yadav et al 2014 howell et al 2015 norton et al 2017 ishfaq et al 2020 more translocation of photosynthates to grains bueno and lafarge 2009 kar et al 2018 decreased sterile spikelet percentage increased filled grains percentage davantgar et al 2009 zhang et al 2010a mote et al 2018 increased panicle biomass matsuo and mochizuki 2009 yushi et al 2013 chu et al 2018 and increased up to 67 6 milling recovery which ultimately increases the market value fofana et al 2010 darzi naftchali et al 2017 in conclusion the application of mild awd safe awd during non critical stages like tillering to mid tillering and post anthesis stage can help improve the grain filling rate and the final yields however severe awd may reduce the final grain yield in some environments like light textured soil on the other hand overlapping of drying cycle of awd at critical stages stand establishment and panicle initiation to grain formation stage may reduce the final crop stand growth and assimilate translocation to sink and paddy yield 4 4 grain quality and heavy metals accumulation the grain quality may vary while switching from the conventional system to water saving rice production systems sarwar et al 2016 besides high water demands in the cf system the cf system reduces grain quality by accumulating heavy metals e g as zhao et al 2010 carrijo et al 2019 and hg rothenberg et al 2016 in grains the safe awd irrigation increased the grain protein contents milling recovery and grain yield while severe awd reduced the grain protein contents darzi naftchali et al 2017 similarly severe awd in the water saving rice system reduced photosynthetic rate translocation of photosynthates to sink and resulted in more electrolyte leakage and hormonal imbalance which led toward the inferior quality of produce jahan et al 2014 the wise application of awd technology not only maintained or increased the yield but also improved the quality of rice table 3 safe awd alters the phytohormonal levels particularly aba and indole acetic acid increased during drying event and increased cytokinin levels upon re watering which boost carbon mobilization toward sink grain from source to ensure the proper grain filling yang et al 2010 zhang et al 2012a wang et al 2016 norton et al 2017 similarly yang et al 2007 postulated that due to the awd irrigation technique a significant increase in head rice recovery and grain pulpiness was recorded with a decrease in kernel chalkiness application of fertilizers the use of micronutrients and the growing of drought tolerant varieties are important factors that are helpful to increase the efficiency of awd in boosting rice quality without sacrificing quality of the produce huang et al 2008 graham acquaah et al 2019 sarwar et al 2016 stated that micronutrient e g boron application along with water saving rice production systems not only increased yield but also improved the rice grain setting and quality in awd drought tolerant genotypes showed reduced abortive chalky opaque kernel and high protein contents that might be attributed to the positive correlation between total nitrogen uptake and grain protein content wang et al 2012 jabran et al 2017 rice cultivation on heavy textured soil using the awd irrigation technique was more tolerant because severe awd did not reduce n uptake in heavy textured soil paul and myers 1971 graham acquaah et al 2019 in conclusion mild awd safe awd may improve growth and phytohormonal balance which boosts carbon mobilization toward sink grain from the source to improve the grain quality 4 4 1 arsenic contamination bioavailability of as in rice grains increases under anaerobic soil condition due to the reduction of as5 to as3 that is present in irrigation water urban residue or due to application of as containing pesticides kumarathilaka et al 2018 as3 is highly mobile in soil and its uptake is mediated by reduction of fe3 to fe2 which release as to soil solution from iron plaques meharg and zhao 2012 and by silicon si uptake pathway because rice is naturally hyperaccumulator of si suriyagoda et al 2018 since cf system reduces the rice grain quality due to higher as uptake water saving rice irrigation practices awd reduce as accumulation in rice grains table 4 yang et al 2017 bakhat et al 2017 islam et al 2017 carrijo et al 2019 wang et al 2019 however mitigation of as uptake in rice grain by awd is highly variable e g from 0 to 90 yang et al 2017 carrijo et al 2018 variability in the reduction of as uptake was attributed to the timing of awd cyles i e crop stage and degree of dryness carrijo et al 2019 irrigation application according to awd alters the redox status and ph of the soil which influence the as mobilization and uptake takahashi et al 2004 li et al 2009 seyfferth et al 2018 carrijo et al 2019 under aerated conditions drying events as affinity increases toward soil mineral and iron plaque formation on the root surface so less as and iron are available to plants roberts et al 2011 talukder et al 2012 rinklebe et al 2016 norton et al 2017 while with the decrease in soil ph as bioavailability in soil is reduced honma et al 2016 safe awd reduces the as accumulation up to 25 while severe awd reduces the as up to 90 chou et al 2016 yang et al 2017 carrijo et al 2018 table 4 a higher degree of dryness 70kpa as in severe awd reduces the as contents in soil and rice grains due to demethylation along with the reduction of iron mn na calcium and molybdenum uptake somenahally et al 2011 linquist et al 2015b lahue et al 2016 rinklebe et al 2016 reid et al 2017 norton et al 2017 carrijo et al 2019 and an increase in zinc uptake wissuwa et al 2008 wang et al 2014a while in safe awd potential to reduce the as accumulation in the grain is lower because during the drying period the soil is not dried to such extent that decreases bioavailability of as norton et al 2017 carrijo et al 2018 carracelas et al 2019 carrijo et al 2019 concluded that severe awd in late season i e booting stage and post anthesis stage reduced the as significantly as compared to early season awd application in conclusion the awd in as contaminated soils may improve the grain quality of rice by reducing grain as contents depending upon the degree of soil drying and crop growth stage however severe awd in the late season post anthesis stage decreases as iron manganese molybdenum and increases the uptake of zinc 4 4 2 mercury methylation and other heavy metals in terrestrial ecosystems paddy fields serve as the primary pathway that exposes hg to humans and wildlife feng et al 2008 zhang et al 2010b tanner et al 2018 as paddy field are the hotspots place for hg methylation meng et al 2010 2011 rothenberg et al 2014 according to hg researcher s consensus the chief source of hg in rice plants is soil while the main source of inorganic hg in rice is ambient air hg qiu et al 2012 yin et al 2013 meng et al 2014 the factors affecting the biochemical cycle of hg in rice ecosystem are very complicated and include hg in irrigation water water management hg in the solid and liquid phase of paddy soil distribution and concentration of hg in ambient air eh of soil iron sulfur dissolved organic carbon and dry and wet deposition of hg ullrich et al 2001 benoit et al 2001 zhao et al 2016 rothenberg et al 2016 similarly according to zhao et al 2016 hg contents in the soil might be not directly influenced by soil organic matter and ph while fluctuation in the eh of paddy field s soil and water saturation levels during the rice season significantly influence the hg bioavailability for methylation process rothenberg and feng 2012 peng et al 2012 wang et al 2014a borin et al 2016 tanner et al 2018 the cf promotes the activities of anaerobic microbes and enhances the hg accumulation in rice grains rothenberg and feng 2012 rothenberg et al 2016 tanner et al 2018 under anaerobic conditions iron fleming et al 2006 and sulfate reducing bacteria facilitate methylation especially of inorganic hg rothenberg and feng 2012 wang et al 2014a liu et al 2014 tanner et al 2018 accumulated hg during the anaerobic conditions at the vegetative phase is readily translocated to rice grains at the grain filling stage meng et al 2011 so water management in paddy fields e g awd is the novel step to mitigate the hg accumulation in rice grain tanner et al 2018 intermittent flooding awd could hinder the hg solubilization and methylation in the rhizosphere of the paddy field ultimately it will result in reduced grain hg than cf table 5 peng et al 2012 the awd also can reduce iron and lead pb toxicity in rice grains cherif et al 2009 ashraf et al 2018 the uptake and translocation of pb content to different plant parts especially in grains is significantly reduced by applying awd irrigation either before flowering or after flowering ashraf et al 2018 in the case of chromium under cf conditions the concentration of cr vi in soil was decreased with the passage of time while under awd conditions it was increased owning to fluctuation in soil eh in contrast to grain as pb and hg the concentration of cr vi and copper cu increased under awd due to more uptake under oxic conditions and was translocated to rice grains xiao et al 2015 rinklebe et al 2016 similarly norton et al 2017 demonstrated that awd application increased the concentration of heavy metals as 36 7 80 8 cu 18 5 27 5 mn and 27 8 67 3 cadmium while the concentration of hg was decreased by 13 7 25 7 as compared to cf in conclusion awd has the potential to mitigate the as pb and hg uptake while increasing zn cr cu and na uptake similarly awd reduces the iron uptake in the iron toxic area but it could be a reason for the iron deficiency in normal soils 4 5 diseases and insect pest attack rice is a very susceptible crop toward diseases and insect pests due to succulence which ultimately affects rice yield and grain quality hasan et al 2016 it was observed that in awd the disease incidence and insect pest attack were less than the cf system chaboussou 2004 chapagain and yamaji 2010 hasan et al 2016 umesh et al 2017 rice plants grown under awd techniques are hardy and resistant to disease incidence e g golden snail bouman et al 2007 root knot false smut blast sheath rot and sheath blight hasan et al 2016 similarly rice crop performs better under awd irrigation technique as compared to cf and is less prone to insects attack e g stem borer rice bug brown plant hopper palis et al 2004 hasan et al 2016 lorica et al 2020 recommended awd as climate smart technology in africa and asia because awd did not enhance the rodent attack however the studies on the relationship between the paddy water environment and insect pests diseases are limited and further experimentation is needed to unravel these findings in conclusion awd has the potential to reduce insect pests and diseases of rice and could be part of strategies for integrated disease management and integrated pest management 4 6 weed infestation higher weed infestation results in lower yield with awd intermittent irrigation as compared to the cf system jabran et al 2015 umesh et al 2017 the cf rice system has inundation condition that suppresses most of the weeds while in awd irrigation drying event exposes the soil surface and increase the aeration that promotes the weed emergence kürschner et al 2010a b jabran and chauhan 2015 murugan et al 2019 however chapagain and yamaji 2010 and umesh et al 2017 reported that in transplanted rice it was worth noting that no extra time was required for weeding in awd plots as compared to cf plots it could be explained as the combined effect of shallow standing water for 10 15 days after transplanting and a single application of pre emergence herbicide chapagain and yamaji 2010 umesh et al 2017 similarly irrigation application according to the awd technique after canopy closure did not allow to enhance the weed proliferation rao et al 2007 field water depth of 2 5 cm or muddy conditions fully saturated conditions for 10 15 days after transplanting not only recover the seedling from transplanting shock but is also helpful for cultural control of weeds lampayan et al 2015b liang et al 2016 mubeen and jabran 2019 ishfaq et al 2020 contrarily early drying soon after the emergence of dsr or transplanting promote the weed infestation that leads towards yield reduction de vries et al 2010 in case of heavy weed infestation awd cycles should be practiced after 2 3 weeks to increase the pre germination herbicide efficacy and to supress the weed anonymous 2018 however the studies on the relationship between the awd irrigation and weed infestation are limited and further experimentation is needed to unravel these findings in conclusion early drying event of awd irrigation increased the weed infestation while application of awd cycle at 50 60 canopy closure not promoted weed infestation 5 water and nutrients use under awd system in plant water relations the most important controversy is either gas exchange is regulated chemically phytohormonal signaling from roots or shoots or hydraulically by changing turgor potential or roots or shoots the leaf water potential ψleaf mediates the aba effect on stomata opening tardieu and davies 1992 aba influence stomatal conductance either directly acting on guard cell or indirectly decreasing leaf hydraulic conductance pantin et al 2013 however consideration of both forms of regulation is useful as both could mediate the response of crops toward water saving techniques dodd et al 2015 any decrease in ψleaf may results in a decline in leaf growth and gas exchange blackman and davies 1985 henson et al 1989 dodd et al 2015 s li et al 2018 g li et al 2018 no doubt many species of plants isohydric are able to maintain ψleaf by closing stomata in response to soil drying tardieu and simonneau 1998 jabran et al 2017 however in context to soil drying ψleaf and gas exchange relationships in a single species can be negative positive or even may have no relationship kudoyarova et al 2007 suggesting that ψleaf cannot always mediate the stomatal closure dodd et al 2015 it was revealed that upon soil drying aba concentration in xylem increased 2 100 folds and cytokinin decreased significantly as compared to well watered plants perez alfocea et al 2011 chen et al 2016 mote et al 2018 in contrast to aba and cytokinin other xylem ionic phosphate nitrate sulfate calcium chloride na potassium and magnesium fluctuations were more inconstant goodger et al 2005 ernst et al 2010 this proposes that as compared to the concentration of xylem ions the concentration of xylem phytohormone shows a more constant measure upon soil drying dodd et al 2015 as a result of stomatal closure the rate of xylem sap flow was declined because xylem loading is not altered by the movement of phytohormones and ions from the root xylem lumen it suggests that upon soil drying under awd xylem sap concentration should increase jackson 1993 dodd 2005 while upon re wetting after soil drying the stomatal response can be delayed which decreases gas exchange jabran et al 2017 an elevated aba in xylem upon re wetting due to translocation from roots and increased concentration of zeatin riboside mediated stomatal opening and closure dörffling et al 1977 loewenstein and pallardy 2002 hansen and dörffling 2003 yang et al 2017 norton et al 2017 however in the case of severe awd membrane injury due to severe drying may be responsible for hindering ion transport across the plasma membrane guard cell after re wetting loewenstein and pallardy 2002 mild safe awd did not influence the chlorophyll contents negatively and hence increased photosynthetic rate due to enough soil moisture potential and a balance between light interception and its utilization jabran et al 2017 moreover higher photosynthetic rate and increased dry matter accumulation under awd was achieved due to high root metabolic activity that ensured the adequate amount of nutrients and water to the leaf mishra et al 2006 zhang et al 2009 jabran et al 2017 however severe awd 40 kpa not only decreased plant tissue water status zhang et al 2010a yang et al 2007 cabangon et al 2011 mahmood et al 2012 but also reduced chlorophyll content and increased electrolyte leakage that ultimately hampered the photosynthesis and dry matter production sengupta and majumder 2009 petrov et al 2012 jahan et al 2014 kar et al 2018 similarly to meet transpiration requirements and goal of higher yield under awd a sufficient number of roots should be available in the deeper soil layer sandhu et al 2017 kondo et al 2000 observed 0 08 ml day cm water extraction in roots exposed to moist soil of upland the same rate can be attained in a lowland rice system under awd irrigation such as deep roots within 25 35 cm depth take up more than 9 mm day where roots functioning rate is optimal linquist et al 2015b montazar et al 2017 5 1 leaf water contents leaf water content also vary under the awd system it was observed that during the soil drying period of the severe awd irrigation ψleaf was 0 56 to 1 23 mpa and it was significantly lower than those in the cf system 0 39 to 0 63 mpa due to restricted water uptake and transport of phytohormones to shoots davies et al 2011 chen et al 2013 while in the drying event of mild awd ψleaf was not significantly different from cf treatment chen et al 2013 upon re wetting of awd ψleaf is restored within hours in severe awd but the gas exchange was restored slowly and takes hours to days and this whole process is mediated by phytohormonal signaling from roots to shoots in the form of aba dodd et al 2015 it was observed that duration and severity of soil drying episode induce variation in ψleaf and xylem sap composition a plant having low ψleaf showed a quick recovery of leaf growth the concentration of xylem cytokinin its delivery and ψleaf upon re irrigating parent et al 2009 2010 zhang 2011 dodd et al 2015 recovery of ψleaf and leaf elongation upon rehydration could be explained due to increased hydraulic conductivity of roots parent et al 2009 dodd et al 2015 that enhance carbon mobilization due to higher aba concentration sandhu et al 2017 5 2 total water inputs and water use efficiency in rice fields cf of water to a greater depth would cause enormous water loss via seepage surface runoff percolation and evaporation wang et al 2010 tan et al 2013 contrarily awd has great potential to reduce water input lampayan et al 2015a along with decreasing irrigation cost and productivity enhancement alauddin et al 2020 for instance rice cultivation with awd irrigation management can reduce water inputs by 18 27 jabran et al 2015 similarly different other studies table 2 indicated that under different climatic and soil conditions adoption of awd reduced water input by 20 23 hasan et al 2016 14 18 belder et al 2004 31 44 liang et al 2016 by maintaining similar or increasing grain yield as compared to cf djaman et al 2018 xu et al 2020 while in other studies awd reduces water input by 23 27 oliver et al 2008 40 70 feng et al 2007 and 49 56 chu et al 2018 at the expense of yield reduction as compared to cf similarly a meta analysis of carrijo et al 2017 concluded that severe awd reduced water use by 33 4 at the expense of yield reduction while mild awd reduced the water inputs by 25 7 with increasing yield moreover research findings showed that under the awd technique the frequency of irrigation was reduced by 22 when compared to conventional rice production systems hasan et al 2016 reduction of water input in awd techniques can be ascribed to the absence of standing water because an optimum degree of soil moisture could be achieved through proliferated root systems and physiological changes in leaves due to partial soil drying martin vertedor and dodd 2011 in the absence of flooding conditions water input is reduced due to the reduction of seepage and percolation losses as soil hydrological properties govern these losses sanchez 1973 tabbal et al 2002 dong et al 2012 massey et al 2014 explained that during the wet season the adoption of the awd technique reduced total water input by 25 7 with the same or improved paddy yield it can be attributed as rain events during the drying cycle of awd can delay the re wetting cycle through re irrigating and also reducing the surface runoff losses while on the other hand implementation of awd seems too difficult under wet season because it s not possible to dry the paddy field in low lying fields under rainy seasons adhya et al 2014 belder et al 2004 stated that the awd technique does not imply forced drainage to reduce water and it can decrease total water use by 15 20 without affecting yield as compared to other crops the wue of the rice crop is much lower lin et al 2002 the adoption of the awd technique has the potential to increase wue by decreasing water input and increasing grain yield lampayan et al 2015a norton et al 2017 ishfaq et al 2020 darzi naftchali et al 2017 obtained higher wues 1 38 1 66 kg m 3 under awd technique as compared to earlier research studies 0 43 1 08 kg m 3 by zhang et al 2012b 0 56 0 82 kg m 3 by bulbul and rahman 2014 and 0 72 1 02 kg m 3 by yang et al 2017 the adoption of awd with timely management of nitrogen fertilizer increased wue because of higher yield ye et al 2013 irrigation efficiency is also increased under the awd technique that can irrigate an additional 14 mha area due to an increase of 10 irrigation efficiency umesh et al 2017 however increased wue under awd is attributed to more water saving as compared to cf yao et al 2012 in conclusion the adoption of awd not only enhances the wue but also has the potential to reduce the total water inputs along with increasing or maintaining yield however severe awd in som cases e g light textured sandy soil may sacrifice the yield in wake of saving water and improving wue 5 3 nutrient acquisition under awd soil chemistry fluctuates as the paddy fields transform from cf submerged condition to awd aerobic condition which could be explained by the effect of awd on grain and straw elemental concentration rinklebe et al 2016 norton et al 2017 fig 4 the changing drying and wetting events during awd can alter processes of nutrient cycling mineralization of nutrient and microbial dynamics which finally affects the nutrients use efficiency ye et al 2013 dodd et al 2015 sandhu et al 2017 moreover the adoption of awd reduces the non point pollution by reducing nutrient losses through runoff and drainage zhao et al 2012 liang et al 2013 2016 and ultimately more nutrients availability to crop for better productivity improved nutrient uptake under awd could be attributed to increased root proliferation and nutrient acquisition from deeper soil horizon because during drying cycle of awd the water level subside below the soil surface to a depth of 15 20 cm that limits the nutrient and water availability ndiiri et al 2012 norton et al 2017 pascual and wang 2017 it was observed that carbon gains macro and micronutrient availability uptake and their concentration in grains as well as in straw altered under awd as compared to cf price et al 2013 dodd et al 2015 due to fluctuation in soil moisture aeration soil ph and soil redox potential 5 3 1 macronutrients one of the key factors and main input that determines the yield of rice is nitrogen n application ju et al 2009 the efficiency of n fertilizer and its apparent recovery is on average only 33 due to inefficient and imbalance use of nitrogenous fertilizers garnett et al 2009 remaining n vanished through leaching in nitrate form volatilization to the atmosphere surface runoff or by microbial denitrification ju et al 2009 research studies indicated that as compared to cf under awd condition more n losses were observed in the form of nitrification and denitrification but these losses did not affect n uptake significantly dong et al 2012 cycling of anaerobic cf and aerobic awd conditions in the soil and elevated concentration of nh4 ions aggravate the nitrification and denitrification n losses nie et al 2015 moreover it was observed that under awd conditions the straw n concentration was reduced significantly as the awd changed the fate of n in paddy fields tan et al 2015 the reason behind the low accumulation of n in plants under awd was described as more n losses due to denitrification and volatilization tan et al 2013 in contrast some research studies indicated that awd practice did not boost losses of n due to the decrease in total n leaching and vertical nh4 n losses and consequently could not decline nue wang et al 2011 synergistic interaction is hypothesized between n fertilizer and soil moisture on crop growth wang et al 2013b if both n and water and are managed timely and properly such synergistic interaction can improve nue and crop yield yang 2015 djaman et al 2018 there are controversies that awd irrigation management enhance nitrogen use efficiency nue or not huda et al 2016 observed that the adoption of awd irrigation did not affect nue significantly low nue under awd based irrigation techniques is due to more n losses which ultimately reduces cumulative plant nitrogen uptake and nue zou et al 2007 in the case of alkaline soils moormann and van breemen 1978 reported more nitrogen losses due to ammonia volatilization as under aerobic conditions the volatilization losses are more dominant severe awd may aggravate the n losses but mild awd could not do so zhang et al 2009 similarly wang et al 2011 and chu et al 2016 reported that stimulation of n losses under awd irrigation depends on the extent of soil drying however n application before re wetting in awd irrigation increased nue due to n water synergetic interaction ye et al 2013 lampayan et al 2015b wang et al 2016 in the case of phosphorus p more p was available in soil solution under cf condition because the supplementary release of organic p occurs under anaerobic conditions young and ross 2001 it would be expected that iron and mn minerals redox sensitives release co precipitated or adsorbed p ions into the soil solution thus the availability of p in the drying event of awd is reduced due to which plant p status grains and straw is lower under awd as compared to cf condition norton et al 2017 it requires more phosphate fertilizer application under awd because the plant may require more p under awd especially in salt affected or acidic soils to increase n and p uptake awd drying events are recommended at 60 canopy cover so that the basally applied n and p fertilizers are taken up by plants and n losses are minimized through coupled nitrification denitrification lahue et al 2016 regarding potassium k both rate and type are important for rice under awd water management ullah and datta 2018 application of k 80 kg ha 1 increases proline synthesis which is directly linked with severe awd tolerance by enhancing the transpiration zain and ismail 2016 under water limited conditions increased the application of k enhances the water deficit tolerance plant growth photosynthesis as well as the yield of crops pervez et al 2004 increasing rates of k under awd significantly enhances the root proliferation of rice to uptake the nutrients and water ullah and datta 2018 and finally help the plant to withstand under water limited environment by closing the stomata and increasing nue and wue egilla et al 2005 marschner 2012 moreover k act as a transporter that circulates the food all over the plant part reduces the sweetness of the leaves thereby reduces insect pest attack wang et al 2013a in sum the reduced basal dose of n and application of n before re irrigation in awd will increase nue and reduce the n losses moreover awd may require extra p and k fertilizer application to increase the awd performance 5 3 2 micronutrients irrigation application according to awd may increase the concentration of some micronutrients in the soil solution as well as in plants while the concentration of some other nutrients may decrease price et al 2013 for example under awd irrigation technique zinc availability as well as uptake and concentration in rice grains was increased wissuwa et al 2008 wang et al 2014b norton et al 2017 demonstrated that awd application increased micronutrient concentration in grains as 18 5 27 5 mn 36 7 80 8 copper while the concentration of calcium iron and sulfur was decreased by 6 3 8 7 10 7 15 5 and 4 2 15 4 respectively as compared to cf the higher nutrient concentration under awd could be attributed to the altering redox potential and higher root metabolic activity that enables the plant to acquire more nutrients and water from greater depth and hence supports the high photosynthetic rate zhang et al 2009 in iron fe toxic coastal area of asia fe toxicity was lower under awd because fe in the soil is usually found in fe 2 form either as a sulfate salt or chelated cherif et al 2009 under aerobic conditions of awd the fe 2 is converted to fe 3 and remains unavailable to plant for uptake du laing et al 2009 rinklebe et al 2016 moreover the changing eh is the strong motive behind the low accumulation of fe in grains under awd and may require the foliar application of iron sulphate in normal soil slamet loedin et al 2015 in contrast zn availability as well as uptake and translocation was higher under the aerobic condition of awd because under cf irrigation zn availability was lower due to precipitation as zinc sulfide or carbonate mixture and both zinc sulfide and carbonate mixture are insoluble forms bostick et al 2001 wang et al 2014b shifting in rice cultivation from cf to water saving production systems awd or aerobic may alter the nutrient uptake e g boron that leads to the increased percentage of unfilled grains and reduced yield sarwar et al 2016 boron availability is reduced under aerobic conditions in paddy fields due to higher eh and fluctuation in ph gao et al 2002 moreover under the aerobic condition of awd higher oh concentrations due to more nitrification leads towards an increased soil ph the higher ph and reduced mobility of b under drying cycles ultimately reduce the b availability and uptake gao et al 2006 that requires foliar application of b in this context b application either basil or foliar in water saving technique awd enhances the pollen viability and total dry matter accumulation sarwar et al 2016 sarwar et al 2016 also observed that the foliar application of boron in a water saving production system at the reproductive stage pi stage reduced the percentage of the sterile and opaque kernel while the percentage of the normal kernel was increased in conclusion the awd system has the potential to increase the availability and uptake of zn and copper however aerobic conditions and higher eh hampered the iron availability and uptake to rice that require the foliar or basal application of iron 6 emission of greenhouse gases in awd system the environmentally friendly rice production requires maintaining the higher rice yield coupled with a reduction in the negative impact on the environment alauddin et al 2020 according to an estimate 10 12 of worldwide anthropogenic ghgs emissions come from agricultural activities smith et al 2007 the emissions of ghgs from agricultural soils are contributing as co2 60 ch4 15 and n2o 5 as compared to co2 over a 100 years time span the gwp of n2o and ch4 is 298 and 34 times more than co2 respectively myhre et al 2013 in context to ch4 emissions rice paddies are most important as 75 of the world s rice is practiced on continuously flooded soils for most of the crop season neue 1997 ipcc 2007 annual ch4 emissions from rice field account to be 31 112 tg year 1 and it is contributing 15 26 of total anthropogenic emission denman et al 2007 diffusion ebullition mechanisms and transport via plant aerenchyma are routes of subsequent ch4 emission from soil to atmosphere krüger et al 2001 in rice paddies under cf conditions the presence of more organic substrates and anaerobic conditions provides an ideal environment for methanogenic bacteria denman et al 2007 the microbiological processes in the soil leading towards ch4 formation are governed by many other biochemical and physical factors eh of soil being most important yu et al 2001 in soil obligate anaerobes methanogenic archaea can only perform optimally in the low eh of soil cicerone and oremland 1988 thus the eh of soil and ch4 emission are inversely related yu et al 2001 usually methanogenic bacteria require eh of soil less than 150 mv to produce ch4 liang et al 2016 it is recommended that ch4 emission can be controlled by changing the metabolic activity and community structure of methanogenic bacteria like more oxidized conditions under aerobic rice or awd management watanabe et al 2010 in paddy fields nutrients and water management are deriving agents for ghgs emissions ipcc 2014 the awd system significantly reduces ghgs emissions of ch4 without sacrificing yield li et al 2006 hosen 2007 wassmann et al 2010 montzka et al 2011 chirinda et al 2017 when compared with cf the awd has the potential to reduce gwp ch4 n2o by 45 90 linquist et al 2015b pandey et al 2014 vu et al 2015 islam et al 2018 similarly another common practice is midseason drainage which reduces ch4 emissions by 10 wassmann et al 2000 considering the importance of awd regarding reduction in ghgs emissions in the usa the american carbon registry approved a methodology voluntary emission reductions in rice management systems it allows the farmer communities to acquire carbon credits on the adoption of water saving technologies in rice production including awd umesh et al 2017 although the effect of awd on the emission of ch4 is significant however there is a trade off with enhanced emission of n2o zou et al 2007 liao et al 2020 increased emission of n2o was reported with a reduction of ch4 emission especially relative to water management in the rice systems hou et al 2000a b zheng et al 2000 stated that awd mid season drainage creates more oxic conditions in the root zone which promotes n2o production an intermediate product of either nitrification or denitrification earlier studies stated that emission of n2o contributes much lesser than ch4 emission to the gwp kurosawa et al 2007 itoh et al 2011 pittelkow et al 2013 but many field based studies indicated that under awd system a significant amount of n2o fluxes are emitted dittert et al 2002 yuan et al 2008 johnson beebout et al 2009 xu et al 2015 these n2o fluxes from water saving practices offset the benefits gained by reducing ch4 emission but still reduces the net gwp as compared to cf yuan et al 2008 higher n2o fluxes also occur due to the overuse of nitrogenous fertilizers mosier and zhu 2000 or coinciding with the drying cycle of awd with more n availability in paddy soils aerobic and anaerobic cycles of awd in paddy fields enhance the n losses due to the availability of more ammonium ions and their intensified nitrification or denitrification processes tan et al 2015 in conclusion the adoption of awd water management has the potential to reduce the ch4 emission and net global warming potential but the imbalance use of nitrogenous fertilizer may aggravate the n2o emission table 6 7 adoption and economics of the awd system the adoption of any agricultural technology by end users farmers relies on its economic viability easiness and its impacts on the environment rice plays a vital role in the economy of many countries throughout the world pandey et al 2010 chauhan et al 2017 rice cultivation using the awd technique of irrigation enhances the economic viability of the system lampayan et al 2015b pearson et al 2018 in field based study the adoption of awd increased the profit by 38 42 due to reduced water inputs in pump irrigation systems i e tube well irrigation and increased yield kürschner et al 2010a b lampayan et al 2015b similarly palis et al 2004 and lampayan et al 2004 indicated that in deep well irrigation system awd the farmers obtained increased profit from 0 1 8 due to lower labor costs no yield penalty and 5 30 water saving alam et al 2009 and lampayan et al 2015b highlighted that farmer community acknowledges that the adoption of awd techniques under dsr not only saves labor water and time but also reduces the total expenditure including reduced use of fuel 20 25 and irrigation cost 12 15 in bangladesh experts claimed that the adoption of the awd technique on a national level could reduce the cost of irrigation by 56 4 million euros by saving electricity or 78 8 million euros by reducing the expenses incurred on fuel miah and sattar 2009 under such conditions awd safe technique being labor saving cost effective and environmentally safe is welcomed by farmers in china northwest bangladesh and many other countries nalley et al 2015 mainuddin et al 2019 hasan et al 2016 explained that in the formal discipline another indicator used for cost benefit analysis is the benefit cost ratio bcr the bcr of conventional rice production is quite lower 1 01 than the bcr of awd 1 19 moreover it is found that the cost of weeding irrigation fertilizers and pesticides was lower in awd as compared to farmers practice furthermore with respect to the environment the emission of co2 is much lower in the awd technique as less fuel is consumed to uplift groundwater alam et al 2009 thus awd helps to sustain the level of the groundwater table therefore for sustainable rice cultivation farmers can comfortably implement awd the awd is recommended for large scale adoption in china bangladesh philippines vietnam indonesia india laos myanmar and thailand due to well documented agronomic economic and environmental benefits lampayan et al 2004 2013 sibayan et al 2010 palis et al 2004 palis et al 2014 rejesus et al 2011 2013 similarly safe awd is now recommended practice in many regions or countries including the philippines rejesus et al 2013 lampayan et al 2013 bangladesh palis et al 2014 vietnam rejesus et al 2013 and myanmar lampayan et al 2013 besides this large scale adoption of awd is on the minuscule area key limitations to the large scale adoption of awd include the complicated relationship between agricultural and socioeconomic systems water pricing and water availability as well as approaches to overcome these constrictions e g incentivisation which are likely to be common or sometimes different to many countries and regions pearson et al 2018 in sum awd is an economically viable irrigation technique because of having a potential of increasing yield saving water labour and fuel consumption while minimizing the harm to the climate 8 conclusions alternate wetting and drying is a promising profitable and ecofriendly technology for rice cultivation across the globe the efforts are underway to commercialize it in water scarce areas the adoption of mild safe awd reduces the total water inputs as compared to cf while maintaining or increasing the yield however severe awd reduces the total water inputs at the expense of yield reduction the practice of awd on non critical growth stages and heavy textured soil results in higher water saving and higher yield while awd practice on critical growth stages and light textured soil results in yield reduction depending upon the degree of soil drying and crop growth stages awd has a potential to improve the plant physiology and grain quality by altering the phytohormonal concentration and reducing the heavy metals arsenic molybdenum lead and mercury uptake while increasing zinc and copper uptake however under water limited conditions awd may require the extra application of phosphorus potassium and foliar application of iron and boron the plants grown under awd irrigation are more resistant against insect pest and disease attack so it could be as part of strategies for integrated disease and pest management however the early drying event of awd irrigation increases the weed infestation while the application of the awd cycle at 50 60 canopy closure did not promote the weed infestation the reduced basal dose of n and application of n before re irrigation in awd will not only increase the nue but also reduce the n losses ghg emission and net global warming potential undoubtedly a trade off between ch4 and n2o exists when shifting from flooding to saturated or drying condition nonetheless a wise and judicious application of nitrogenous fertilizers and irrigation management on the basis of other allied tools leaf colour chart and soil testing can reduce the global warming potential significantly large scale adoption of the awd system is being challenged due to farmer s community perception as they conceived it as yield penalty technique and they experience heavy weeds flushes due to changing soil water regimes full incentives cannot be achieved along with only adopting awd but an integrated approach is required to enhance the resource use efficiency and overall profitability at the farmer field these challenges require site specific technology and extension work to change the farmer s perception integrated weed management practices for weed control and use of all resources according to soil type and farm situation

10509,this study aims to investigate the relationship between rhizosphere soil nitrification and compensatory growth of potted corn zea mays l seedlings upon post drought rewatering on the basis of leaf cytokinin induced by roots the nitrification inhibitor 3 4 dimethylpyrazole phosphate was added to the soil to restrain nitrification in soil the experimental design consisted of six treatments 1 wetness 2 wetness with the nitrification inhibitor addition 3 wetness with the nitrification inhibitor and nitrate additions 4 post drought rewatering 5 post drought rewatering with the nitrification inhibitor addition and 6 post drought rewatering with the nitrification inhibitor and nitrate additions the results showed that compared with wetness rewatering alone increased the aboveground and total biomasses and the net photosynthetic rates of corn but rewatering had little influence on these parameters following the nitrification inhibitor addition or both the inhibitor and nitrate additions without the nitrification inhibitor addition the increase of carbohydrate content in root exudates of rewatering corn caused by drought stress accounted for rhizosphere soil nitrification rate augment during rewatering that were closely related to the delivery rate of cytokinin from the roots to the leaves however increased nitrification rates in non rhizosphere soil were not recorded in rewatering treatment without the addition of the nitrification inhibitor the net leaf photosynthetic rate of corn increased due to the elevated cytokinin levels in leaves leading to the occurrence of compensatory growth and high water use efficiency of corn by contrast nitrification inhibitor application decreased the rhizosphere soil nitrification rate followed by the consequent under compensatory growth and low water use efficiency of corn and the under compensatory growth and low water use efficiency of corn also occurred in corns with the addition of both nitrification inhibitor and nitrate therefore rhizosphere nitrification plays a key role in corn compensatory growth keywords rhizosphere soil nitrification corn compensatory growth cytokinin rewatering upon drought stress 1 introduction water scarcity is a major constraint to crop production worldwide a large number of studies have been carried out to study the crop drought tolerance mechanisms associated with crop production petrov et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 in northern china crop production is seriously threatened by the scarcity of water resources yan et al 2018 thus crop water use in this region needs to be improved compensatory growth of crops during post drought rewatering refers to the ability of plants to accumulate biomass through the mechanism of rapid growth when the water supply is available to compensate for biomass losses due to drought stress belsky 1986 and grogan and zamin 2018 assumed that compensatory biomasses below equal to and exceeding the lost biomass correspond to under compensation compensation and over compensation respectively to date different water saving technologies such as supplemental irrigation in dryland farming rainwater harvesting irrigation regulated deficit irrigation and deficit irrigation are widely used in agricultural production wei et al 2018 ali et al 2019 himanshu et al 2019 martinez romero et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 compensatory growth of crops is the theoretical basis for these technologies and it is therefore important in theory and practice essentially compensatory growth is defined as the rapid growth stimulated by rewatering roots are the organs experiencing the stimulation from rewatering thus they play an important role in the growth of plants during rewatering wang et al 2018a found that root produced cytokinins in corn during post drought rewatering were transported to leaves which resulted in changes in stomatal conductance following the enhanced cytokinin levels in leaves and increased leaf photosynthetic rate as a result corn compensatory growth upon post drought rewatering was promoted soil nitrate no3 could stimulate the synthesis of cytokinin in the roots landrein et al 2018 poitout et al 2018 wang et al 2018b found that when corn was planted in sand amended with nitrate no3 no3 induced stimulation of compensatory growth occurred through the translocation of root derived cytokinins to the leaves the release of no3 through soil nitrification indicates the importance of this process for crop compensatory growth of post drought rewatering in non rhizosphere soil although nitrification could cause the release of soil no3 the mobility of no3 in soil by water created difficulty in accumulation which was not favorable for the stimulation of no3 on roots in contrast the nitrification rate in the rhizosphere soil was higher zeno et al 2018 tang et al 2019 which made it a favorable environmental media for the release of no3 and rhizosphere soil integrating with roots effectively promotes no3 accumulation in it leading to enhanced no3 stimulation on roots and root cytokinin synthesis followed by increased leaf cytokinin concentration and compensatory growth of the crop however little work has been done to investigate the relationship between rhizosphere nitrification and crop compensatory growth an investigation of the effect of rhizosphere nitrification on root produced leaf cytokinin would provide further insight into the mechanism of crop compensatory growth corn is the third most cultivated crop worldwide and the most widely grown crop in china the growth changes of corn seedlings can be easily detected due to their rapid growth thus we used corn seedlings as test materials to determine the effect of rhizosphere soil nitrification on crop compensatory growth upon post drought rewatering the nitrification inhibitor 3 4 dimethylpyrazole phosphate was added to soil to restrain nitrification in soil leaves xylem saps and soils were sampled from plants to measure plant hormones photosynthetic indices and nitrification rates in both the rhizosphere and non rhizosphere soils 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design this study was conducted in the experimental farm of the henan university of science and technology the farm 34 32 n 112 16 e altitude 138 m is located in luoyang city henan province this area receives a mean annual rainfall of 601 mm and has a mean annual temperature of 14 2 c the corn zea mays l cultivar zhengdan 958 was used as the test material in this study this cultivar is widely planted in china due to its drought resistance and wide adaptability the pot experiment was conducted under a rain shelter the experiment was conducted for 41 days from may 13 2019 to june 23 2019 on may 13 2019 200 pots with a mouth diameter of 21 5 cm and a height of 20 0 cm were prepared and 12 corn seeds were planted in each pot each pot contained 5 8 kg of soil with organic carbon and total nitrogen contents of 24 3 and 2 16 g kg respectively after six days of seedling emergence the pots were thinned to five strong and healthy seedlings per pot the selected seedlings were left to grow for ten days one hundred and eight pots with uniformly grown seedlings were selected for use in this study the schematic in fig 1 clearly displays the trial time course treatment setting and related indicators measured in the 108 pots these selected pots were divided into six groups with 18 pots per group the 10 day growth periods of drought stress and rewatering were established soils in the first second and third groups were kept constantly wet throughout the two growth periods the pots in the fourth fifth and sixth groups were subjected to drought stress and wetness during drought stress and rewatering respectively approximately 13 ml of 3 4 dimethylpyrazole phosphate solution 1 g l was added to the soils of the second third fifth and sixth groups per day during drought stress period to restrain soil nitrification of the rewatering period the results of our preliminary experiment found that the inhibitory effect of the 3 4 dimethylpyrazole phosphate on soil nitrification showed hysteresis nearly 100 ml no3 solution 1 5 g l was added daily to the soils in the third and sixth groups during rewatering this study had six treatments with 18 pots for each treatment treatments were as follows 1 wetness wt 2 wetness with the addition of the nitrification inhibitor to soil wr 3 wetness with the addition of the nitrification inhibitor and no3 wn 4 post drought rewatering dt 5 post drought rewatering with the addition of the nitrification inhibitor to soil dr and 6 post drought rewatering with the addition of the nitrification inhibitor and no3 dn eighteen pots allotted to each treatment were divided into six groups with three pots each three replicates were prepared for each treatment each replicate one pot from 6 00 am to 9 00 pm water was added to each pot to maintain 75 80 or 50 55 of the field capacity when the soil water content was below 75 or 50 of the field capacity respectively to simulate the wetness and drought stress xiong et al 2007 stated that the soil water content within each treatment could be calculated by using the following formula 1 1 s w c b t b d b e b p b d f w c 100 where swc is the soil water content bt is the temporary weight of the whole pot bd is the net weight of dried soil for each pot be is the weight of the empty pot bp is the estimated fresh weight of all plants in each pot and fwc is the field water capacity the estimated fresh weight of all plants in one pot during each test period was determined in advance on extra pots two groups for each treatment were chosen at the end of the drought stress period and on 5th and 10th day of post drought rewatering one group was used to measure plant hormones biomass soil nh4 and no3 contents and soil nitrification rates root exudates were collected from plants in the other group to determine the soluble carbohydrate content in root exudates net photosynthetic rate pn transpiration rate tr and stomatal conductance sc for each treatment were measured at the end of the drought stress period and on 3rd 6th and 9th day after rewatering 2 2 measurements and data analysis the corn roots were separated from the plants through washing fresh samples were dried at 65 c for 72 h for determination of biomass the sum of the stem and leaf biomasses was used to determine aboveground biomass and total biomass was calculated on the basis of the sum of the stem leaf and root biomasses fresh leaves were dried at 65 c for 72 h to determine the dry matter and the difference between fresh leaf weight and dry weight was divided by dry matter to obtain the leaf water content total biomass increase divided by water use during the drought stress and rewatering periods was used to get water use efficiency total biomass value at the end of the rewatering period minus its value at the beginning of the drought stress period was used to obtain the total biomass increase the amount of water added during drought stress and rewatering periods was used to indicate the amount of water used li 6400 photosynthesis equipment was used to measure pn tr and gs at 11 00 am on sunny days using three leaves of each pot during the measurement a built in blue red light with a photon flux density of 1000 μmol m 2 s 1 was used the co2 concentration and temperature in the leaf chamber were set at 400 μmol mol 1 and 26 respectively the average values of pn tr and gs in 3 leaves per pot were used as their actual values soil ammonium nh4 and no3 contents were measured using the indophenol blue colorimetric method and phenol disulfonic acid spectrophotometry respectively lu 1999 according to lu 1999 the culture method was used to measure soil net nitrification rate the soil samples of dt dr and dn at the end of drought stress period were cultured at 25 c for 7 days under 50 55 of the ﬁeld water capacity to simulate drought stress condition the soil samples in all treatments on 5th and 10th day after rewatering and the soil samples of wt wr and wn at the end of drought stress period were cultured at 25 c for 7 days under 75 80 of the ﬁeld water capacity to simulate wetness condition the soil no3 contents were measured both before and after culture and their differences were divided by culture time 7 days to obtain the net nitrification rates in soils the corn plants were removed from pots and their roots were rinsed and placed in 500 ml of deionized water in sunlight for 8 h to collect root exudates the root exudates were dissolved in deionized water to make concentrated extracts for the measurement of the total soluble carbohydrate content in root exudates the amount of soluble carbohydrate per h was divided by root dry weight to obtain the amount of carbohydrate accumulated in root exudates the water soluble carbohydrate concentration of the concentrated liquid was measured by the anthrone colorimetric method zou 1995 the volume of xylem sap was determined by the weighing method after clipping the stem wounds were immediately covered with 1 0 g of absorbent cotton the cotton s weight was determined after 12 h the increase in the weight of the absorbent cotton was considered the quantity of xylem sap the increase in weight was divided by 1 g cm to obtain the xylem sap volume the cotton pieces were placed and compacted at the bottom of a 10 ml syringe with a piston the sap from each sample was pooled in a 5 ml centrifuge tube for the determination of the zeatin riboside zr and abscisic acid aba concentrations of xylem sap indole 3 acetic acid iaa gibberellic acid ga3 zr and aba concentrations in leaves and zr and aba concentrations in xylem saps were measured by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay using the previously described method qin and wang 2019 iaa ga3 aba and zr test kits were produced by the phytohormone research institute of china agricultural university the amounts of iaa ga3 aba and zr were divided by their leaf sample weight to obtain their contents in leaves and then divided by the volume of xylem sap to obtain the contents of zr c zr and aba c aba in the xylem sap the delivery rates of zr r zr and aba r aba from the roots to the leaves were expressed as the amounts of zr and aba in the xylem saps per h respectively the abbreviations used in the text are summarized in table 1 statistical analyses were performed using microsoft excel 2007 the average values were presented in the tables or graphs the effects of rewatering and the addition of the nitrification inhibitor to soil on compensatory growth during the rewatering period were analyzed using duncan s multiple range test p 0 05 3 results 3 1 biomass as shown in fig 2 the aboveground and total biomasses were significantly lower in wr treatment than in wt and in dr treatment than in dt on the 5th and 10th days after rewatering the total biomass was also significantly lower in dt treatment than in wt in dr than in wr and in dn compared to that in wn treatment prior to rewatering these results showed that drought stress and nitrification inhibitor inhibited corn growth although the aboveground and total biomass values were similar in wn and wr treatments and in dn and dr treatments prior to rewatering they significantly increased in wn compared to those in wr and in dn than in dr at 5 and 10 days after rewatering thus the addition of no3 to soil reversed the adverse effect of the nitrification inhibitor and stimulated the corn growth during rewatering this study evaluated the compensatory growth on the basis of total biomass no significant differences were found between total biomass in wt and dt treatments at ten days after rewatering resulting in the occurrence of compensatory growth in dt however total biomass remained significantly higher in wr than in dr and in wn than in dn at 10 days post rewatering thus under compensatory growth simultaneously occurred in dr and dn as shown in fig 3 water use efficiency were 3 15 times higher in dt than in wt 2 08 times higher in dr than in wr and 1 51 times higher in dn than in wn therefore dt was the most effective way to increase water use among these rewatering treatments 3 2 photosynthetic characteristics and leaf water content as shown in fig 4 pn tr and sc were significantly higher in wt wr and wn compared to those in dt dr and dn respectively prior to rewatering moreover the treatments wt and dt had significantly higher pn tr and sc than those in wr and dr respectively on the 3rd 6th and 9th day after rewatering these results demonstrated that drought stress and the application of the nitrification inhibitor restrained photosynthesis in corn the significant increases in pn sc and tr occurred in dt compared to those in wt on the 3rd 6th and 9th day after rewatering indicated that rewatering increased photosynthesis in the absence of nitrification inhibitor no significant differences in pn tr and sc were observed between wr and wn and between dr and dn prior to rewatering however pn tr and sc were significantly higher in wn than in wr and in dn compared to those in dr on 3rd 6th and 9th day after rewatering therefore the addition of no3 to soil reversed the adverse effect of nitrification inhibitor on photosynthesis and thus increased the photosynthetic rate as shown in fig 5 significantly higher leaf water content was found in wt than in dt and in wr than in dr before rewatering however during rewatering wt and dt and wr and dr had similar values of leaf water content these results showed that drought stress decreased leaf water content but it was recovered following rewatering similarly the nitrification inhibitor also decreased leaf water content but no3 addition to soil recovered it the leaf water content was significantly higher in wt than in wr and in dt than in dr during the drought stress and rewatering periods however during rewatering the significant increases in leaf water content occurred in wn compared to those in wr and in dn compared to those in dr 3 3 plant hormones as shown in table 2 significantly higher values of leaf zr content rzr and czr were recorded in wt wr and wn than those in dt dr and dn respectively prior to rewatering zr is the main form of cytokinin these results showed that drought stress decreased leaf cytokinin content and cytokinin delivery from roots to leaves by contrast rewatering in the absence of the nitrification inhibitor increased these indices given that significantly higher leaf zr content at 5 and 10 days after rewatering and rzr and czr at 5 days after rewatering were observed in dt but not in wt leaf zr content and czr were significantly higher in wt than in wr and in dt than in dr on the 5th and 10th days after rewatering these results indicated that the nitrification inhibitor decreased cytokinin contents in leaves and xylem sap significantly higher zr content in leaf was detected in wn than in wr and in dn compared to that in dr during rewatering but no significant differences of rzr and czr were found in wn and wr and in dn and dr therefore the addition of no3 to soil reversed the adverse effect of the nitrification inhibitor on leaf cytokinin content and thus increased it the aba content was significantly lower in dt dr and dn than in wt wr and wn respectively prior to rewatering but not during rewatering these results revealed that leaf aba content increased under drought stress but decreased after rewatering leaf iaa content had significantly higher values in wr than in wt and in dr than in dt during drought stress and rewatering periods and was significantly lower in wn than in wr and in dn compared to that in dr during rewatering period these results showed that leaf iaa content increased with the addition of the nitrification inhibitor but decreased with no3 addition to soil the nitrification inhibitor and rewatering slightly influenced leaf ga3 content 3 4 soil nitrification rate soil nh4 and no3 nitrogen significantly higher soil no3 content and lower soil nh4 content in non rhizosphere and rhizosphere soils were found in wt than in dt prior to rewatering during rewatering no significant decline in soil nh4 content or no significant increase in soil no3 content was found in wt compared to those in dt in both the non rhizosphere and rhizosphere soils table 3 these results found that drought stress restrained the accumulation of soil no3 and increased the accumulation of soil nh4 and rewatering destroyed these effects due to the addition of no3 to the soil significantly high soil no3 contents in non rhizosphere and rhizosphere soils were detected in wn than in wt and wr and in dn than in dr and dt during the rewatering period the addition of no3 to soil decreased soil nh4 content contributing to significantly lower soil nh4 content in wn than in wr and in dn than in dr during the rewatering period in the non rhizosphere and rhizosphere soils significantly higher nitrification rates were found in wt than in dt prior to rewatering moreover the nitrification rate in rhizosphere soil was significantly higher in dt than in wt on the 5th and 10th day after rewatering but no significant differences were found between wt and dt in non rhizosphere soil nitrification rate therefore in the absence of the nitrification inhibitor drought stress restrained soil nitrification and rewatering increased nitrification rate in rhizosphere soil the nitrification inhibitor had a similar effect as drought stress on soil nitrification the solute carbohydrate content in root exudates was significantly higher in dt than in wt in dr than in wr and in dn than in wn prior to rewatering no significant differences were found between dt and wt between dr and wr and between dn and wn for carbohydrate content after 10 days of rewatering these results indicated that the accumulation of carbohydrate in root exudates was enhanced following drought stress and decreased over time during rewatering a similar result for decreased solute carbohydrate content in root exudates after the addition of the nitrification inhibitor was reported 4 discussion 4 1 soil nitrification and compensatory growth roots the main sites of cytokinin synthesis secrete and deliver cytokinins to the leaves via the xylem sap zaicovski et al 2008 wang et al 2016 r zr defines the capacity of the roots to deliver cytokinin to the leaves in the dark the products of t r and c zr could be used to express the photoperiod cytokinin delivery rate as the transport of sap from the roots to the leaves in sunlight is driven by transpiration the higher values of rzr czr and tr in dt than in wt during rewatering indicated more cytokinin synthesis in roots and delivery to leaves thus higher leaf cytokinin content in dt than in wt which was the main reason for the occurrence of compensatory growth in dt in the absence of the nitrification inhibitor cytokinin regulates stomatal conductance in plants and stomatal opening in leaves contributes to plant photosynthesis de moura et al 2017 the essence of crop compensatory growth is the rapid accumulation of organic matter through photosynthesis the higher sc in dt compared to that in wt during rewatering indicates a close relationship between sc and leaf cytokinin contents leading to the increased net photosynthetic rate of corn in rewatering compared to that in wetness treatment in the presence of the nitrification inhibitor or no3 rzr czr and tr were not higher in dr than those in wr or in dn than those in wn which showed that not more cytokinin synthesis in roots were delivered to increase leaf cytokinin contents and pn in dr compared to wr or in dn compared to wn leading to under compensatory growth in dr and dn due to the most effective way to increase water use being in dt among the three rewatering treatments the compensatory growth in dt played a key role in increasing water use effectively thus the addition of nitrification inhibitor or no3 is not a good way to increase corn compensatory growth and water use efficiency 4 2 soil nitrification and cytokinin soil nitrification causes the release of no3 from soil soil no3 directly induces cytokinin synthesis in the roots of various plant species landrein et al 2018 poitout et al 2018 due to the presence of nitrification inhibitor in wr and dr treatments no3 contents in both rhizosphere and non rhizosphere soils were higher in wt than in wr and in dt compared to those in dr these results demonstrated more intense stimulatory effects of soil no3 on roots thus larger amounts of cytokinin were synthesized in the roots and delivered to the leaves in wt than in wr and in dt than in dr leading to high leaf cytokinin content in wt compared with wr and in dt compared with dr therefore soil nitrification plays a key role in the transport of cytokinin from the roots to the leaves and the increase in leaf cytokinin concentration through soil no3 leaching following the addition of no3 to soil high no3 contents in both rhizosphere and non rhizosphere soils in dn and wn enhanced cytokinin synthesis in roots and delivery to leaves compared to that in dr and wr respectively although the values of czr and rzr were similar in dn and dr and in wn and wr the high tr indicated the transport of larger amounts of root synthesized cytokinin to leaves thereby higher leaf cytokinin contents in dn compared to that in dr and in wn than in wr these effects provided further evidence for the key role of soil nitrification in an increase in leaf cytokinin through the release of no3 from the soil in the non rhizosphere soil during rewatering the soil nitrification rate in dt was similar to that reported for wt which resulted in similar values for soil no3 concentrations between both treatments indicating a similar stimulatory effect of soil no3 on roots however higher cytokinin amounts were synthesized in roots and delivered to leaves resulting in high leaf cytokinin content in dt compared with wt thus nitrification in non rhizosphere soil plays a minor role in cytokinin synthesis in roots and its delivery to leaves in corn in rewatering compared to the wetness treatment in the absence of the nitrification inhibitor although similar rhizosphere soil no3 contents were in dt and wt larger amounts of cytokinin were synthesized in roots and delivered to leaves in dt than in wt during rewatering resulting in higher leaf cytokinin content in dt the main reason for this were that in the rhizosphere micro environment the higher nitrification rate in dt compared to that in wt during rewatering contributed to the release of additional no3 thus increasing the chances of roots being exposed to no3 in addition the rhizosphere is a site where roots are in direct contact with the soil and directly exposed to no3 which is beneficial for stimulating cytokinin synthesis in roots the use of soil no3 for corn growth hindered no3 accumulation in the rhizosphere soil which were the main reason for similar rhizosphere soil no3 contents were in dt and wt with the addition of the nitrification inhibitor to the soil not higher nitrification rate in rhizosphere soil was found in dr compared to that in wr during rewatering contributing to similar leaf cytokinin contents in both the treatments the addition of no3 to the soils of dn and wn didn t cause high no3 contents in both rhizosphere and non rhizosphere soil in dn compared with wn resulting in similar leaf cytokinin contents in them thus in the present study the stimulatory effect of rhizosphere soil nitrification on the cytokinin content in leaves was the most effective way to increase the corn compensatory growth and water use efficiency 4 3 root exudates and rhizosphere soil nitrification hamilton and frank 2001 found that the increase in carbohydrate content in root exudates in grassland caused by grazing enhanced the accumulation and mineralization of soil organic matter leading to the subsequent increase in soil nitrification similarly soils rich in organic matter the mineralization rate increased resulting in increased soil nitrification fang et al 2019 carbohydrates are secreted by plant roots into rhizosphere soil under drought stress karlowsky et al 2018 williams and de vries 2020 calvo et al 2019 in the present study drought stress enhanced carbohydrate accumulation in root exudates followed by a subsequent increase in the nitrification in rhizosphere soil during rewatering in dt than in wt by contrast although carbohydrate accumulation in root exudates increased in dr compared to that in wr rewatering could not increase the nitrification in rhizosphere soil due to the presence of the nitrification inhibitor 5 conclusion the growth of corn and leaf photosynthesis was restrained by drought stress moreover these processes were promoted by rewatering while inhibited by the application of the nitrification inhibitor growth compensation and under compensation in corn plants occurred in the absence and presence of the nitrification inhibitor respectively drought stress increased the accumulation of carbohydrates in root exudates leading to increased nitrification rate in rhizosphere soil during rewatering the increase in the nitrification rate in rhizosphere soil during rewatering in the absence of the nitrification inhibitor promoted root cytokinin synthesis and delivery of cytokinin from roots to leaves thus leaf cytokinin increased and consequently enhanced photosynthetic rate which then resulted in promoted compensatory growth and high water use efficiency of corn the addition of nitrification inhibitor was disadvantageous for corn compensatory growth and decreased corn water use efficiency because it decreased rhizosphere soil nitrification rate the addition of no3 to the soils containing nitrification inhibitor could change the adverse effects of nitrification inhibitor on corn compensatory growth and under compensation and low water use efficiency also occurred in corns with the addition of both nitrification inhibitor and no3 in summary nitrification in rhizosphere soil

10509,this study aims to investigate the relationship between rhizosphere soil nitrification and compensatory growth of potted corn zea mays l seedlings upon post drought rewatering on the basis of leaf cytokinin induced by roots the nitrification inhibitor 3 4 dimethylpyrazole phosphate was added to the soil to restrain nitrification in soil the experimental design consisted of six treatments 1 wetness 2 wetness with the nitrification inhibitor addition 3 wetness with the nitrification inhibitor and nitrate additions 4 post drought rewatering 5 post drought rewatering with the nitrification inhibitor addition and 6 post drought rewatering with the nitrification inhibitor and nitrate additions the results showed that compared with wetness rewatering alone increased the aboveground and total biomasses and the net photosynthetic rates of corn but rewatering had little influence on these parameters following the nitrification inhibitor addition or both the inhibitor and nitrate additions without the nitrification inhibitor addition the increase of carbohydrate content in root exudates of rewatering corn caused by drought stress accounted for rhizosphere soil nitrification rate augment during rewatering that were closely related to the delivery rate of cytokinin from the roots to the leaves however increased nitrification rates in non rhizosphere soil were not recorded in rewatering treatment without the addition of the nitrification inhibitor the net leaf photosynthetic rate of corn increased due to the elevated cytokinin levels in leaves leading to the occurrence of compensatory growth and high water use efficiency of corn by contrast nitrification inhibitor application decreased the rhizosphere soil nitrification rate followed by the consequent under compensatory growth and low water use efficiency of corn and the under compensatory growth and low water use efficiency of corn also occurred in corns with the addition of both nitrification inhibitor and nitrate therefore rhizosphere nitrification plays a key role in corn compensatory growth keywords rhizosphere soil nitrification corn compensatory growth cytokinin rewatering upon drought stress 1 introduction water scarcity is a major constraint to crop production worldwide a large number of studies have been carried out to study the crop drought tolerance mechanisms associated with crop production petrov et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 in northern china crop production is seriously threatened by the scarcity of water resources yan et al 2018 thus crop water use in this region needs to be improved compensatory growth of crops during post drought rewatering refers to the ability of plants to accumulate biomass through the mechanism of rapid growth when the water supply is available to compensate for biomass losses due to drought stress belsky 1986 and grogan and zamin 2018 assumed that compensatory biomasses below equal to and exceeding the lost biomass correspond to under compensation compensation and over compensation respectively to date different water saving technologies such as supplemental irrigation in dryland farming rainwater harvesting irrigation regulated deficit irrigation and deficit irrigation are widely used in agricultural production wei et al 2018 ali et al 2019 himanshu et al 2019 martinez romero et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 compensatory growth of crops is the theoretical basis for these technologies and it is therefore important in theory and practice essentially compensatory growth is defined as the rapid growth stimulated by rewatering roots are the organs experiencing the stimulation from rewatering thus they play an important role in the growth of plants during rewatering wang et al 2018a found that root produced cytokinins in corn during post drought rewatering were transported to leaves which resulted in changes in stomatal conductance following the enhanced cytokinin levels in leaves and increased leaf photosynthetic rate as a result corn compensatory growth upon post drought rewatering was promoted soil nitrate no3 could stimulate the synthesis of cytokinin in the roots landrein et al 2018 poitout et al 2018 wang et al 2018b found that when corn was planted in sand amended with nitrate no3 no3 induced stimulation of compensatory growth occurred through the translocation of root derived cytokinins to the leaves the release of no3 through soil nitrification indicates the importance of this process for crop compensatory growth of post drought rewatering in non rhizosphere soil although nitrification could cause the release of soil no3 the mobility of no3 in soil by water created difficulty in accumulation which was not favorable for the stimulation of no3 on roots in contrast the nitrification rate in the rhizosphere soil was higher zeno et al 2018 tang et al 2019 which made it a favorable environmental media for the release of no3 and rhizosphere soil integrating with roots effectively promotes no3 accumulation in it leading to enhanced no3 stimulation on roots and root cytokinin synthesis followed by increased leaf cytokinin concentration and compensatory growth of the crop however little work has been done to investigate the relationship between rhizosphere nitrification and crop compensatory growth an investigation of the effect of rhizosphere nitrification on root produced leaf cytokinin would provide further insight into the mechanism of crop compensatory growth corn is the third most cultivated crop worldwide and the most widely grown crop in china the growth changes of corn seedlings can be easily detected due to their rapid growth thus we used corn seedlings as test materials to determine the effect of rhizosphere soil nitrification on crop compensatory growth upon post drought rewatering the nitrification inhibitor 3 4 dimethylpyrazole phosphate was added to soil to restrain nitrification in soil leaves xylem saps and soils were sampled from plants to measure plant hormones photosynthetic indices and nitrification rates in both the rhizosphere and non rhizosphere soils 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design this study was conducted in the experimental farm of the henan university of science and technology the farm 34 32 n 112 16 e altitude 138 m is located in luoyang city henan province this area receives a mean annual rainfall of 601 mm and has a mean annual temperature of 14 2 c the corn zea mays l cultivar zhengdan 958 was used as the test material in this study this cultivar is widely planted in china due to its drought resistance and wide adaptability the pot experiment was conducted under a rain shelter the experiment was conducted for 41 days from may 13 2019 to june 23 2019 on may 13 2019 200 pots with a mouth diameter of 21 5 cm and a height of 20 0 cm were prepared and 12 corn seeds were planted in each pot each pot contained 5 8 kg of soil with organic carbon and total nitrogen contents of 24 3 and 2 16 g kg respectively after six days of seedling emergence the pots were thinned to five strong and healthy seedlings per pot the selected seedlings were left to grow for ten days one hundred and eight pots with uniformly grown seedlings were selected for use in this study the schematic in fig 1 clearly displays the trial time course treatment setting and related indicators measured in the 108 pots these selected pots were divided into six groups with 18 pots per group the 10 day growth periods of drought stress and rewatering were established soils in the first second and third groups were kept constantly wet throughout the two growth periods the pots in the fourth fifth and sixth groups were subjected to drought stress and wetness during drought stress and rewatering respectively approximately 13 ml of 3 4 dimethylpyrazole phosphate solution 1 g l was added to the soils of the second third fifth and sixth groups per day during drought stress period to restrain soil nitrification of the rewatering period the results of our preliminary experiment found that the inhibitory effect of the 3 4 dimethylpyrazole phosphate on soil nitrification showed hysteresis nearly 100 ml no3 solution 1 5 g l was added daily to the soils in the third and sixth groups during rewatering this study had six treatments with 18 pots for each treatment treatments were as follows 1 wetness wt 2 wetness with the addition of the nitrification inhibitor to soil wr 3 wetness with the addition of the nitrification inhibitor and no3 wn 4 post drought rewatering dt 5 post drought rewatering with the addition of the nitrification inhibitor to soil dr and 6 post drought rewatering with the addition of the nitrification inhibitor and no3 dn eighteen pots allotted to each treatment were divided into six groups with three pots each three replicates were prepared for each treatment each replicate one pot from 6 00 am to 9 00 pm water was added to each pot to maintain 75 80 or 50 55 of the field capacity when the soil water content was below 75 or 50 of the field capacity respectively to simulate the wetness and drought stress xiong et al 2007 stated that the soil water content within each treatment could be calculated by using the following formula 1 1 s w c b t b d b e b p b d f w c 100 where swc is the soil water content bt is the temporary weight of the whole pot bd is the net weight of dried soil for each pot be is the weight of the empty pot bp is the estimated fresh weight of all plants in each pot and fwc is the field water capacity the estimated fresh weight of all plants in one pot during each test period was determined in advance on extra pots two groups for each treatment were chosen at the end of the drought stress period and on 5th and 10th day of post drought rewatering one group was used to measure plant hormones biomass soil nh4 and no3 contents and soil nitrification rates root exudates were collected from plants in the other group to determine the soluble carbohydrate content in root exudates net photosynthetic rate pn transpiration rate tr and stomatal conductance sc for each treatment were measured at the end of the drought stress period and on 3rd 6th and 9th day after rewatering 2 2 measurements and data analysis the corn roots were separated from the plants through washing fresh samples were dried at 65 c for 72 h for determination of biomass the sum of the stem and leaf biomasses was used to determine aboveground biomass and total biomass was calculated on the basis of the sum of the stem leaf and root biomasses fresh leaves were dried at 65 c for 72 h to determine the dry matter and the difference between fresh leaf weight and dry weight was divided by dry matter to obtain the leaf water content total biomass increase divided by water use during the drought stress and rewatering periods was used to get water use efficiency total biomass value at the end of the rewatering period minus its value at the beginning of the drought stress period was used to obtain the total biomass increase the amount of water added during drought stress and rewatering periods was used to indicate the amount of water used li 6400 photosynthesis equipment was used to measure pn tr and gs at 11 00 am on sunny days using three leaves of each pot during the measurement a built in blue red light with a photon flux density of 1000 μmol m 2 s 1 was used the co2 concentration and temperature in the leaf chamber were set at 400 μmol mol 1 and 26 respectively the average values of pn tr and gs in 3 leaves per pot were used as their actual values soil ammonium nh4 and no3 contents were measured using the indophenol blue colorimetric method and phenol disulfonic acid spectrophotometry respectively lu 1999 according to lu 1999 the culture method was used to measure soil net nitrification rate the soil samples of dt dr and dn at the end of drought stress period were cultured at 25 c for 7 days under 50 55 of the ﬁeld water capacity to simulate drought stress condition the soil samples in all treatments on 5th and 10th day after rewatering and the soil samples of wt wr and wn at the end of drought stress period were cultured at 25 c for 7 days under 75 80 of the ﬁeld water capacity to simulate wetness condition the soil no3 contents were measured both before and after culture and their differences were divided by culture time 7 days to obtain the net nitrification rates in soils the corn plants were removed from pots and their roots were rinsed and placed in 500 ml of deionized water in sunlight for 8 h to collect root exudates the root exudates were dissolved in deionized water to make concentrated extracts for the measurement of the total soluble carbohydrate content in root exudates the amount of soluble carbohydrate per h was divided by root dry weight to obtain the amount of carbohydrate accumulated in root exudates the water soluble carbohydrate concentration of the concentrated liquid was measured by the anthrone colorimetric method zou 1995 the volume of xylem sap was determined by the weighing method after clipping the stem wounds were immediately covered with 1 0 g of absorbent cotton the cotton s weight was determined after 12 h the increase in the weight of the absorbent cotton was considered the quantity of xylem sap the increase in weight was divided by 1 g cm to obtain the xylem sap volume the cotton pieces were placed and compacted at the bottom of a 10 ml syringe with a piston the sap from each sample was pooled in a 5 ml centrifuge

volume of xylem sap to obtain the contents of zr c zr and aba c aba in the xylem sap the delivery rates of zr r zr and aba r aba from the roots to the leaves were expressed as the amounts of zr and aba in the xylem saps per h respectively the abbreviations used in the text are summarized in table 1 statistical analyses were performed using microsoft excel 2007 the average values were presented in the tables or graphs the effects of rewatering and the addition of the nitrification inhibitor to soil on compensatory growth during the rewatering period were analyzed using duncan s multiple range test p 0 05 3 results 3 1 biomass as shown in fig 2 the aboveground and total biomasses were significantly lower in wr treatment than in wt and in dr treatment than in dt on the 5th and 10th days after rewatering the total biomass was also significantly lower in dt treatment than in wt in dr than in wr and in dn compared to that in wn treatment prior to rewatering these results showed that drought stress and nitrification inhibitor inhibited corn growth although the aboveground and total biomass values were similar in wn and wr treatments and in dn and dr treatments prior to rewatering they significantly increased in wn compared to those in wr and in dn than in dr at 5 and 10 days after rewatering thus the addition of no3 to soil reversed the adverse effect of the nitrification inhibitor and stimulated the corn growth during rewatering this study evaluated the compensatory growth on the basis of total biomass no significant differences were found between total biomass in wt and dt treatments at ten days after rewatering resulting in the occurrence of compensatory growth in dt however total biomass remained significantly higher in wr than in dr and in wn than in dn at 10 days post rewatering thus under compensatory growth simultaneously occurred in dr and dn as shown in fig 3 water use efficiency were 3 15 times higher in dt than in wt 2 08 times higher in dr than in wr and 1 51 times higher in dn than in wn therefore dt was the most effective way to increase water use among these rewatering treatments 3 2 photosynthetic characteristics and leaf water content as shown in fig 4 pn tr and sc were significantly higher in wt wr and wn compared to those in dt dr and dn respectively prior to rewatering moreover the treatments wt and dt had significantly higher pn tr and sc than those in wr and dr respectively on the 3rd 6th and 9th day after rewatering these results demonstrated that drought stress and the application of the nitrification inhibitor restrained photosynthesis in corn the significant increases in pn sc and tr occurred in dt compared to those in wt on the 3rd 6th and 9th day after rewatering indicated that rewatering increased photosynthesis in the absence of nitrification inhibitor no significant differences in pn tr and sc were observed between wr and wn and between dr and dn prior to rewatering however pn tr and sc were significantly higher in wn than in wr and in dn compared to those in dr on 3rd 6th and 9th day after rewatering therefore the addition of no3 to soil reversed the adverse effect of nitrification inhibitor on photosynthesis and thus increased the photosynthetic rate as shown in fig 5 significantly higher leaf water content was found in wt than in dt and in wr than in dr before rewatering however during rewatering wt and dt and wr and dr had similar values of leaf water content these results showed that drought stress decreased leaf water content but it was recovered following rewatering similarly the nitrification inhibitor also decreased leaf water content but no3 addition to soil recovered it the leaf water content was significantly higher in wt than in wr and in dt than in dr during the drought stress and rewatering periods however during rewatering the significant increases in leaf water content occurred in wn compared to those in wr and in dn compared to those in dr 3 3 plant hormones as shown in table 2 significantly higher values of leaf zr content rzr and czr were recorded in wt wr and wn than those in dt dr and dn respectively prior to rewatering zr is the main form of cytokinin these results showed that drought stress decreased leaf cytokinin content and cytokinin delivery from roots to leaves by contrast rewatering in the absence of the nitrification inhibitor increased these indices given that significantly higher leaf zr content at 5 and 10 days after rewatering and rzr and czr at 5 days after rewatering were observed in dt but not in wt leaf zr content and czr were significantly higher in wt than in wr and in dt than in dr on the 5th and 10th days after rewatering these results indicated that the nitrification inhibitor decreased cytokinin contents in leaves and xylem sap significantly higher zr content in leaf was detected in wn than in wr and in dn compared to that in dr during rewatering but no significant differences of rzr and czr were found in wn and wr and in dn and dr therefore the addition of no3 to soil reversed the adverse effect of the nitrification inhibitor on leaf cytokinin content and thus increased it the aba content was significantly lower in dt dr and dn than in wt wr and wn respectively prior to rewatering but not during rewatering these results revealed that leaf aba content increased under drought stress but decreased after rewatering leaf iaa content had significantly higher values in wr than in wt and in dr than in dt during drought stress and rewatering periods and was significantly lower in wn than in wr and in dn compared to that in dr during rewatering period these results showed that leaf iaa content increased with the addition of the nitrification inhibitor but decreased with no3 addition to soil the nitrification inhibitor and rewatering slightly influenced leaf ga3 content 3 4 soil nitrification rate soil nh4 and no3 nitrogen significantly higher soil no3 content and lower soil nh4 content in non rhizosphere and rhizosphere soils were found in wt than in dt prior to rewatering during rewatering no significant decline in soil nh4 content or no significant increase in soil no3 content was found in wt compared to those in dt in both the non rhizosphere and rhizosphere soils table 3 these results found that drought stress restrained the accumulation of soil no3 and increased the accumulation of soil nh4 and rewatering destroyed these effects due to the addition of no3 to the soil significantly high soil no3 contents in non rhizosphere and rhizosphere soils were detected in wn than in wt and wr and in dn than in dr and dt during the rewatering period the addition of no3 to soil decreased soil nh4 content contributing to significantly lower soil nh4 content in wn than in wr and in dn than in dr during the rewatering period in the non rhizosphere and rhizosphere soils significantly higher nitrification rates were found in wt than in dt prior to rewatering moreover the nitrification rate in rhizosphere soil was significantly higher in dt than in wt on the 5th and 10th day after rewatering but no significant differences were found between wt and dt in non rhizosphere soil nitrification rate therefore in the absence of the nitrification inhibitor drought stress restrained soil nitrification and rewatering increased nitrification rate in rhizosphere soil the nitrification inhibitor had a similar effect as drought stress on soil nitrification the solute carbohydrate content in root exudates was significantly higher in dt than in wt in dr than in wr and in dn than in wn prior to rewatering no significant differences were found between dt and wt between dr and wr and between dn and wn for carbohydrate content after 10 days of rewatering these results indicated that the accumulation of carbohydrate in root exudates was enhanced following drought stress and decreased over time during rewatering a similar result for decreased solute carbohydrate content in root exudates after the addition of the nitrification inhibitor was reported 4 discussion 4 1 soil nitrification and compensatory growth roots the main sites of cytokinin synthesis secrete and deliver cytokinins to the leaves via the xylem sap zaicovski et al 2008 wang et al 2016 r zr defines the capacity of the roots to deliver cytokinin to the leaves in the dark the products of t r and c zr could be used to express the photoperiod cytokinin delivery rate as the transport of sap from the roots to the leaves in sunlight is driven by transpiration the higher values of rzr czr and tr in dt than in wt during rewatering indicated more cytokinin synthesis in roots and delivery to leaves thus higher leaf cytokinin content in dt than in wt which was the main reason for the occurrence of compensatory growth in dt in the absence of the nitrification inhibitor cytokinin regulates stomatal conductance in plants and stomatal opening in leaves contributes to plant photosynthesis de moura et al 2017 the essence of crop compensatory growth is the rapid accumulation of organic matter through photosynthesis the higher sc in dt compared to that in wt during rewatering indicates a close relationship between sc and leaf cytokinin contents leading to the increased net photosynthetic rate of corn in rewatering compared to that in wetness treatment in the presence of the nitrification inhibitor or no3 rzr czr and tr were not higher in dr than those in wr or in dn than those in wn which showed that not more cytokinin synthesis in roots were delivered to increase leaf cytokinin contents and pn in dr compared to wr or in dn compared to wn leading to under compensatory growth in dr and dn due to the most effective way to increase water use being in dt among the three rewatering treatments the compensatory growth in dt played a key role in increasing water use effectively thus the addition of nitrification inhibitor or no3 is not a good way to increase corn compensatory growth and water use efficiency 4 2 soil nitrification and cytokinin soil nitrification causes the release of no3 from soil soil no3 directly induces cytokinin synthesis in the roots of various plant species landrein et al 2018 poitout et al 2018 due to the presence of nitrification inhibitor in wr and dr treatments no3 contents in both rhizosphere and non rhizosphere soils were higher in wt than in wr and in dt compared to those in dr these results demonstrated more intense stimulatory effects of soil no3 on roots thus larger amounts of cytokinin were synthesized in the roots and delivered to the leaves in wt than in wr and in dt than in dr leading to high leaf cytokinin content in wt compared with wr and in dt compared with dr therefore soil nitrification plays a key role in the transport of cytokinin from the roots to the leaves and the increase in leaf cytokinin concentration through soil no3 leaching following the addition of no3 to soil high no3 contents in both rhizosphere and non rhizosphere soils in dn and wn enhanced cytokinin synthesis in roots and delivery to leaves compared to that in dr and wr respectively although the values of czr and rzr were similar in dn and dr and in wn and wr the high tr indicated the transport of larger amounts of root synthesized cytokinin to leaves thereby higher leaf cytokinin contents in dn compared to that in dr and in wn than in wr these effects provided further evidence for the key role of soil nitrification in an increase in leaf cytokinin through the release of no3 from the soil in the non rhizosphere soil during rewatering the soil nitrification rate in dt was similar to that reported for wt which resulted in similar values for soil no3 concentrations between both treatments indicating a similar stimulatory effect of soil no3 on roots however higher cytokinin amounts were synthesized in roots and delivered to leaves resulting in high leaf cytokinin content in dt compared with wt thus nitrification in non rhizosphere soil plays a minor role in cytokinin synthesis in roots and its delivery to leaves in corn in rewatering compared to the wetness treatment in the absence of the nitrification inhibitor although similar rhizosphere soil no3 contents were in dt and wt larger amounts of cytokinin were synthesized in roots and delivered to leaves in dt than in wt during rewatering resulting in higher leaf cytokinin content in dt the main reason for this were that in the rhizosphere micro environment the higher nitrification rate in dt compared to that in wt during rewatering contributed to the release of additional no3 thus increasing the chances of roots being exposed to no3 in addition the rhizosphere is a site where roots are in direct contact with the soil and directly exposed to no3 which is beneficial for stimulating cytokinin synthesis in roots the use of soil no3 for corn growth hindered no3 accumulation in the rhizosphere soil which were the main reason for similar rhizosphere soil no3 contents were in dt and wt with the addition of the nitrification inhibitor to the soil not higher nitrification rate in rhizosphere soil was found in dr compared to that in wr during rewatering contributing to similar leaf cytokinin contents in both the treatments the addition of no3 to the soils of dn and wn didn t cause high no3 contents in both rhizosphere and non rhizosphere soil in dn compared with wn resulting in similar leaf cytokinin contents in them thus in the present study the stimulatory effect of rhizosphere soil nitrification on the cytokinin content in leaves was the most effective way to increase the corn compensatory growth and water use efficiency 4 3 root exudates and rhizosphere soil nitrification hamilton and frank 2001 found that the increase in carbohydrate content in root exudates in grassland caused by grazing enhanced the accumulation and mineralization of soil organic matter leading to the subsequent increase in soil nitrification similarly soils rich in organic matter the mineralization rate increased resulting in increased soil nitrification fang et al 2019 carbohydrates are secreted by plant roots into rhizosphere soil under drought stress karlowsky et al 2018 williams and de vries 2020 calvo et al 2019 in the present study drought stress enhanced carbohydrate accumulation in root exudates followed by a subsequent increase in the nitrification in rhizosphere soil during rewatering in dt than in wt by contrast although carbohydrate accumulation in root exudates increased in dr compared to that in wr rewatering could not increase the nitrification in rhizosphere soil due to the presence of the nitrification inhibitor 5 conclusion the growth of corn and leaf photosynthesis was restrained by drought stress moreover these processes were promoted by rewatering while inhibited by the application of the nitrification inhibitor growth compensation and under compensation in corn plants occurred in the absence and presence of the nitrification inhibitor respectively drought stress increased the accumulation of carbohydrates in root exudates leading to increased nitrification rate in rhizosphere soil during rewatering the increase in the nitrification rate in rhizosphere soil during rewatering in the absence of the nitrification inhibitor promoted root cytokinin synthesis and delivery of cytokinin from roots to leaves thus leaf cytokinin increased and consequently enhanced photosynthetic rate which then resulted in promoted compensatory growth and high water use efficiency of corn the addition of nitrification inhibitor was disadvantageous for corn compensatory growth and decreased corn water use efficiency because it decreased rhizosphere soil nitrification rate the addition of no3 to the soils containing nitrification inhibitor could change the adverse effects of nitrification inhibitor on corn compensatory growth and under compensation and low water use efficiency also occurred in corns with the addition of both nitrification inhibitor and no3 in summary nitrification in rhizosphere soil
