of biological systems engineering university of nebraska lincoln lincoln ne usa handling editor dr r thompson irrigation scheduling methods have been used to determine the timing and amount of water applied to crops scheduling techniques can include measurement of soil water content quantification of crop water use and monitoring of crop physiological response to water stress the aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of a simplified crop canopy temperature measurement ctm method as irrigation principles soil and water conservation engineera technique to schedule irrigation for maize specifically the degrees above non stressed dans index which suggests water stress when canopy temperature exceeds the non stressed canopy temperature t cns was determined by estimating tcns from a weather based multilinear regression model the modeled tcns had a strong correlation with observed t cns with a pooled r2 values of 0 94 across the 2018 2019 and 2020 growing seasons this dans index was also highly correlated with the conventionally used crop water stress index cwsi with r2 values of 0 67 0 59 and 0 76 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively furthermore dans had a strong linear relationship with soil water depletion above 60 in the 0 60 m soil profile with an r2 of 0 78 the ctm method was also compared to more commonly used scheduling methods namely soil moisture monitoring smm and crop evapotranspiration modeling etm grain yield was significantly lower for the ctm method than for the etm method in 2018 and 2020 but not in 2019 no significant differences were observed in irrigation water productivity iwp in 2018 however all treatments were significantly different with the ctm method having the greatest iwp in 2020 for attempting to trigger full irrigation with the ctm method a fixed dans threshold of 0 5 c was found to be more appropriate than the literature value of 1 0 c but consideration of crop growth stage would further improve scheduling keywords canopy temperature crop water stress index evapotranspiration irrigation water productivity soil water content data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global population growth is anticipated to rise to an estimate of 9 2 billion people in 2050 which will consequently increase demand on available food sources and associated agricultural production resources particularly water jury and vaux 2007 stewardship of current water resources therefore necessitates adaptable and innovative methodologies to optimize water use while efficiently meeting demands such as agricultural production for this increasing population in water limited environments such stewardship includes development and adoption of irrigation water management methods and technologies to determine proper timing and depth of irrigation irrigation scheduling methods and technologies include soil moisture monitoring smm plant sensors proximal sensors daily evapotranspiration modeling etm visual observation mimicking neighbors and feel of soil among others usda nass 2019 rudnick et al 2020 unfortunately however these methods vary widely in their ability to match irrigation with crop water needs rudnick et al 2020 for instance a variety of sensors can be used in smm to quantify soil attributes and associate them to soil water content within the crop root zone evett et al 2012 lekshmi et al 2014 typically smm methods involve the estimation of volumetric soil water content θ v which is maintained above a trigger threshold often based on the management allowable depletion mad concept the θ v measurements are influenced by instrument accuracy and must consider soil physical characteristics and crop development and rooting depth which are complex parameters to estimate when scheduling irrigation evett et al 2012 gu et al 2020 taghvaeian et al 2020 recently developed smm measuring tools are also limited by their ability to represent large spatial areas at continuous temporal scales while long established methods such as the neutron moisture meter nmm and gravimetric soil sampling are not widely utilized outside the academic research community due to complexity in application and associated costs evett et al 2012 alternatively etm and soil water balance based models have been employed to estimate crop water use and this information is utilized to quantify how much water is needed to replenish the root zone storage via irrigation huffman et al 2013 anderson and french 2019 gu et al 2020 however the accuracy of model input parameters can affect the correctness of crop etm based irrigation water management methods model inaccuracies are likely to arise from imprecise soil physical property estimation inexact measurements of microclimate and resulting reference evapotranspiration et r and or the use of generic crop coefficient k c values gu et al 2020 emerging irrigation water management techniques such as canopy temperature measurement ctm using infrared thermometers have been described as a non destructive affordable means to spatially and temporally monitor crop water stress for irrigation management jones 2004 dejonge et al 2015 o shaughnessy et al 2015 ihuoma and madramootoo 2017 commonly the crop water stress index cwsi idso et al 1981 has successfully been used to monitor water stress in a variety of crops including sorghum o shaughnessy et al 2012 sugarbeet king et al 2021 maize payero and irmak 2006 and soybean payero and irmak 2006 however adoption of cwsi as an irrigation scheduling method has been limited because its computation requires establishment or modeling of non stressed and maximally stressed crop conditions along with concurrent measurements of air temperature and relative humidity dejonge et al 2015 alternatively simplified crop thermal indices such as degrees above non stressed dans have been developed by relating observed canopy temperature t c to a single non stressed canopy baseline temperature t cns taghvaeian et al 2014 although this dans method has been used for monitoring water stress in maize dejonge et al 2015 and sunflower taghvaeian et al 2014 in arid environments there is opportunity to test the method s viability and transferability in different climatic regions to establish appropriate scheduling protocols and index thresholds furthermore while initial t cns baselines were suggested by maintaining and monitoring a non stressed reference area dejonge et al 2015 increased access to weather datasets presents an opportunity to alternatively model the t cns which could further simplify the computation of the dans index and increase the method s adoption as an irrigation water management tool by farmers this study was therefore focused on the implementation of ctm specifically the dans index as a real time irrigation water management tool in semi arid mid western united states and highlights the method s development implementation and outcomes e g applied irrigation yield response and performance metrics this will contribute to the resources pool that water managers can consider reviewing as they determine which irrigation water management method to adopt in semi arid environments additionally the dans index method was compared to the conventional smm and etm methods under similar environments and agronomic practices the selection of irrigation water management methods to investigate was based on a technique s extensive usage in research smm method common application amongst farmers etm method and contemporary scheduling approaches used in recent years ctm method the study objectives were 1 to develop and evaluate an empirical non stressed canopy baseline t cns for the degrees above non stressed dans index 2 to compare the dans index against conventional canopy temperature measurement method cwsi and 3 to evaluate the effectiveness of the dans index against soil water monitoring and evapotranspiration model for irrigation scheduling by assessing soil water dynamics irrigation water use efficiency and grain yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description 2 1 1 experiment design the field

157 and 126 kg ha 1 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively pesticides were applied uniformly as needed to the entire study the study field was harvested on 29 october 7 november and 30 october in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively using a john deere model 9500 combine with a calibrated yield monitor a randomized complete block design was implemented consisting of four blocks each having 9 m by 72 m experimental plots three irrigation scheduling treatments were evaluated namely soil moisture monitoring smm crop evapotranspiration model etm and canopy temperature measurement ctm irrigation of 20 mm was applied when a treatment triggered to further evaluate the three scheduling methods it was necessary to compare the method s performances with a non irrigated low irrigated and excessively irrigated crops the experiment design therefore included treatments managed under different irrigation levels namely rainfed rf which received no irrigation water deficit irrigation di and excess irrigation ei the di and ei treatments were 60 12 mm and 140 28 mm of the smm treatment respectively and followed the irrigation timing of the smm treatment the di and ei treatments were included to properly evaluate whether the three irrigation treatments under optimally or over irrigated as determined by the crop production function the experimental units were individually irrigated by a subsurface drip irrigated sdi system the sdi system consisted of laterals drip lines spaced at 1 52 m under alternate furrows and at a depth of 0 4 m below the soil surface the drip tape type was t

evaporative demand greatly influences irrigation requirement klocke et al 1989 payero et al 2005 the microclimatic data including air temperature t a incoming solar radiation r s wind speed at 3 m height u 3 precipitation p and relative humidity rh were collected from an automatic weather station north platte 3sw beta that was 100 m away from the experimental field and is part of the nebraska mesonet network https mesonet unl edu during the experimental growing seasons r s ranged from 10 4 to 23 8 mj m 2 d 1 with an average of 18 5 5 1 mj m 2 d 1 in 2018 from 12 0 to 24 3 mj m 2 d 1 with an average value of 18 5 4 8 mj m 2 d 1 in 2019 and 12 0 25 3 mj m 2 d 1 with an average value of 20 1 5 0 mj m 2 d 1 in 2020 table 2 this resulted in percentage et r differences from the 30 year long term seasonal total of 8 8 15 9 and 10 5 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively which suggested a greater evaporative demand and need for irrigation in 2020 in comparison to 2018 and 2019 furthermore the corresponding rainfall totals from may 1 to october 31 were 432 503 and 235 mm in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively these seasonal totals translated in 19 8 and 39 5 increase in rainfall above long term average in 2018 and 2019 as compared to a 34 9 decline in 2020 these weather parameter differences suggested a drier than average year in 2020 a wetter than average year in 2019 and a slightly wetter than average year in 2018 2 2 data collection volumetric soil water content θ v was measured weekly to bi weekly from a depth of 0 15 1 80 m in 2018 and 0 15 2 59 m in 2019 and 2020 at increments of 0

respectively while the cpn 503 elite hydroprobe was cross calibrated to the cpn 503dr with r2 of 0 994 and rmse of 0 004 m3 m 3 respectively lo et al 2020 during the 2018 season one neutron access tube was placed within a crop row in three plots of each treatment in 2019 and 2020 a pair of access tubes were placed in four plots of each treatment with the two tubes straddling a crop row evenly and being 0 38 m apart perpendicular to the row direction canopy temperature measurements were taken using si 1h1 and si 4hi series infrared thermometers irt sensors apogee instruments inc ut usa due to limitations in sensor availability an irt sensor was installed in three smm plots every year but in two ctm plots for 2018 and three ctm plots for 2019 and 2020 there were no irt sensors installed in the etm treatment the irt sensors were mounted approximately 1 m above the crop canopy and oriented at a 45 view angle towards the crop to maximize the viewing of sunlit crop canopy during mid afternoon hours the irts were oriented in the northeast direction the sensors were programmed to collect data every six seconds which was averaged over one minute and sampled using cr1000 measurement and control data loggers campbell scientific inc ut 2 3 irrigation scheduling methods 2 3 1 soil moisture monitoring smm for irrigation scheduling the top 0 91 m soil depth was considered as the effective root zone in the vegetative to early reproductive growth stages for irrigation management in this study following kranz et al 2008 and the root zone was expanded to 1 22 m in the late reproductive season to allow for extraction of water from a deeper soil depth yonts et al 2008 the soil available water content awc was computed as 1 awc i n θ fci θ wpi d i θ fcn θ wpn d n where θ fc is the volumetric water content at field capacity fc m3 m 3 θ wp is the volumetric water content at wilting point wp m3 m 3 and d is the soil depth ranging from i to n within the limits of the managed maize crop root depth as determined by the crop growth stage depending on the crop growth stage the allowable depletion ad value varied to reflect the crop s ability to extract water and tolerate water stress prior to irrigation events these ad values were developed based off near optimal irrigation management conditions for maize at the research site in 2017 lo et al 2019 which took into account the crop growth stage and approximate rooting depth the ad values ranged from 27 4 mm at fifth leaf v5 to 152 4 mm at kernel dent r5 75 growth stage table 3 the difference between the average volumetric water content θ v across the 0 91 m soil profile and θ fc across the managed rooting depth was computed and denoted as the real time depletion value rtd eq 2 a decision to irrigate was made when the rtd value exceeded a selected allowable depletion ad value 2 rtd i θ fci θ vi rz i where rtd is the real time soil water depletion m at time i θ v is the average measured volumetric water

allen et al 1998 trout and dejonge 2018 gu et al 2020 was used to calculate wd eq 3 3 wd j et aj 1 ro j 1 dp j 1 wd j 1 i j i p j 1 where dp is deep percolation mm p is precipitation mm i is applied irrigation mm et a is crop evapotranspiration mm ro is runoff mm and subscripts j and j 1 represent the current day and previous day respectively runoff ro was computed using the usda natural resources conservation service nrcs runoff curve number method usda nrcs 1985 with a curve number of 75 deep percolation was assumed to occur two days following a wetting event and was estimated using the cascading method djaman and irmak 2012 in this study all water above field capacity was assumed to drain maize et a was computed using the two step method allen et al 1998 calculated as 4 et a k c et r where k c is a single crop coefficient and et r is alfalfa tall crop reference evapotranspiration the k c values were derived using data collected during the 2017 growing season and are presented in table 3 daily maize et a was measured from an onsite eddy covariance system the field was fully fertilized and irrigated and extended 230 m south of the tower the system was installed with a maximum instrument height of 3 96 m which allowed for a 1 m height above canopy latent heat flux data processing and filtering accounting for only the footprint from the maize field was done by li cor biosciences lincoln ne using eddypro software version 6 2 et r was calculated using the asce standardized reference crop evapotranspiration equation asce ewri 2005 rudnick and irmak 2014 lo et al 2019 using onsite weather data collected by the nebraska mesonet https mesonet unl edu the resultant kc values were compared to kc values previously measured at the experiment site gerosa 2011 and within the experiment region hinkle et al 1984 and were found to be similar and representative of a well watered maize crop 2 3 3 canopy temperature measurement ctm degrees above non stressed dans thermal index was used as the ctm irrigation scheduling method the computation of dans eq 5 ideally requires the maintenance of a well watered non stressed crop which is contrasted with the canopy temperature measured from the study treatments taghvaeian et al 2014 dejonge et al 2015 kullberg et al 2017 drechsler et al 2019 the maintenance of a well water crop necessitates constant monitoring and frequent irrigation of the crop to prevent water stress yet irrigation system limitations amongst other constraints may be encountered additionally the non stressed crop ideally needs to be monitored for each growing season to reflect ongoing atmospheric demand to satisfy the requirement of a non stressed canopy baseline dejonge et al 2015 considered the lowest observed temperature from available treatments as the t cns in both cwsi and dans index computations alternatively this study suggested that a modeled non stressed temperature be used to approximate the well watered crop conditions for the dans index 5 dans t c t cns a multilinear regression model was used to estimate t cns dependent variable with weather parameters t a r s and vapor pressure deficit vpd as the independent variables the lowest observed peak time 14 45 16 45 central daylight time utc 5 t c measurements amongst treatments starting after 80 canopy closure were used in the regression analysis and model development peak time t c measurements were selected because greater standard deviations in measured t c were observed across the treatments in comparison to those observed in the early morning or late night hours of the day data not shown this diurnal variation in maize t c values was also observed in research conducted by dejonge et al 2015 and suggested that spot thermal indices could be computed from temperature data collected 1 2 h after solar noon the multilinear regression was done using r 3 5 0 r core team 2018 packages while the correlation statistics were computed in microsoft excel 365 microsoft corporation redmond wa usa the coefficients of the selected predictor parameters were significant at a p value of 0 05 to the model the data was filtered to remove cloudy day conditions as well as dates when vpd values were less than 1 kpa in 2018 data from the 2017 growing season was used in the model while in 2019 and 2020 the model included data sets from both 2017 and 2018 table 4 the resulting model rmse values were 0 46 and 0 38 c in 2018 and 2019 respectively maize was considered minimally moderately and severely stressed at dans values of 1 0 c 1 0 5 0 c and 5 0 8 3 c respectively in a previous study in colorado dejonge et al 2015 in the current study an irrigation threshold of 1 c was selected in 2018 but this threshold was later lowered to 0 5 c in 2019 and 2020 to better capture and respond to the onset of crop water stress the difference between the observed field measured t c and modeled t cns was compared to the selected dans index threshold value prior to making an irrigation decision an irrigation decision was therefore made when the computed dans value exceeded the set threshold i e 1 c in 2018 and 0 5 c in 2019 and 2020 2 4 crop water stress index the crop water stress index cwsi has been used as a measure of maize crop water thermal stress in studies conducted in the mid west usa payero and irmak 2006 singh et al 2021 cwsi infers water stress as a function of thermal measurement and environment in this research the computed dans index was compared to empirically established cwsi index following idso et al 1981 eq 6 1 the lower

from 2017 2018 and 2019 was used to define lb lb 1 6012vpd 2 0677 r2 0 75 for the cwsi computations on the other hand a constant value 4 c was used as the upper baseline ub based on field observed measurements of canopy temperature from the deficit and rainfed treatments 2 5 performance assessment and statistical analysis differences in grain yield across irrigation scheduling treatments and years were investigated using the analysis of variance anova statistical procedures in sas studio 3 8 software sas institute inc cary nc the anova analysis assumed normal distribution of variables independence of variables and homogeneity of variances the fisher s protected least significance difference test was performed at 95 significance level in addition the impact of irrigation scheduling method on crop water productivity was evaluated using irrigation water productivity iwp eq 7 bos 1980 1985 rudnick and irmak 2013 lo et al 2019 evett et al 2020 7 iwp y i y rf i i where y is grain yield adjusted to 15 5 moisture content i is applied irrigation and subscripts i and rf represent irrigated and rainfed treatments respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 modeled non stressed canopy temperature and seasonal dans index variation a multilinear regression table 4 was used to model the non stressed canopy temperature baseline which was required for the computation of the dans index the coefficient of determination r2 values for the regression between the peak time observed t cns and modeled t cns on non cloudy days were 0 95 0 94 and 0 96 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively fig 1 the corresponding growing season rmse values were 0 46 0 55 and 0 41 c in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively the higher rmse values observed in 2019 which was the wetter growing season suggest that modeling of t cns did not perform as well in wetter than average conditions at the experiment site despite this the overall goodness of fit across the three experimental years suggested that modeled t cns could be used in substitution to field measured t cns during the computation of the dans index this model based t cns could therefore further ease the adoption and application of the dans index method for irrigation scheduling the variation in the dans index per treatment contrasted against the selected thermal threshold values during the growing seasons of 2018 2019 and 2020 are presented in fig 2 in 2018 a trigger threshold value of 1 0 c was selected for the dans index while in 2018 and 2020 the trigger threshold was 0 5 c in 2018 the dans index for the ctm treatment in july was closer in magnitude to the di treatment than to smm treatment in which irrigation was managed to maintain full crop et this delay in irrigation i e greater crop water stress by the ctm treatment in 2018 was due to the higher stress threshold selected the dans seasonal values ranged from 2 c to over 8 c across the three different growing seasons higher dans index values were observed in the rf treatment after the r4 growth stage at the onset of crop senescence taghvaeian et al 2014 reported dans values slightly over 8 c and those below 0 c for sunflower during different measurement times in the peak period and the negative values are assumed to indicate non water stressed conditions the 2019 growing season received above normal rainfall which resulted in less water stress and subsequently overall lower magnitude dans values across the treatments the season was also characterized with days that had vpd values of less than 1 kpa for which the dans index was not computed for irrigation scheduling therefore the greatest spread in dans index values was observed in 2020 which was a dry year while the above normal rainfall year of 2019 had the least difference in dans values across treatments the difference in dans values indicated that the index was responsive to irrigation and could be used to infer crop water stress slightly higher early season v6 growth stage dans values in 2019 could be attributed to partial view of the soil surface by the irt sensor prior to full canopy closure while the late season peak dans values across the seasons were associated with crop maturity and onset of senescence these higher range dans values were not considered for the dans index based irrigation scheduling which renders that method unusable prior to full canopy closure or at the end of the growing season if the need for irrigation water is warranted in 2018 and 2019 there were slight differences in magnitude of dans values during the early season v8 to vt due to reduced early crop water demand on the other hand the v8 to vt dans values across treatments in 2020 were greater reflecting the dry nature of the growing season the mid reproductive season r2 to r3 in 2018 and 2019 indicated difference in dans values which could be attributed to differences in irrigation water applied as determined by the scheduling method the extreme dry conditions in 2020 resulted in concurrent irrigation triggering by both the smm and ctm treatments hence the lower differences in magnitude of dans values during the r3 to r4 growth stages greatest differences in dans were observed during the later reproductive stage r4 especially in the rf treatment which was attributed to early senescence these in season variations in dans values with growth stages suggested that a static dans threshold as the one used in the study was likely to under or overestimate stress along the growing season 3 2 cswi dans relationship the correlations between conventionally used cwsi and the dans index for the rf di smm and ctm treatments are presented in fig 3 the resulting correlation coefficients across the three experiment seasons were 0 67 0 59 and 0 75 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively this correlation of the dans index computed using modeled tcns to conventionally used thermal stress cwsi suggested that dans could also be used for crop water monitoring and irrigation scheduling taghvaeian et al 2014 found that the correlation coefficients of cwsi and dans for sunflower ranged from 0 80 to 0 86 across different hourly periods and that dans was responsive to irrigation the relationship between cwsi and dans was stronger in the drier 2020 growing season which also had higher average t c values across the treatments the increased correlation in the drier growing season suggested that both indices were more responsive to crop water stress in water limited conditions similarly dejonge et al 2015 reported a correlation coefficient of 0 50 for mean canopy temperatures between 27 c and 29 c and a higher correlation coefficient of 0 90 between cwsi and dans for mean canopy temperatures greater than 29 c in maize 3 3 seasonal irrigation patterns across scheduling treatments seasonal cumulative irrigation as applied by the three scheduling methods juxtaposed with rainfall and crop growth stage is presented in fig 4 the ctm method triggered irrigation later in the season during the mid reproductive growth stage in 2018 and a cumulative total of 102 mm was applied the amount was relatively lower in magnitude than that applied by the smm 166 mm and etm 193 mm methods given the same environmental and soil physical conditions this underestimation of irrigation water requirement was attributed to the higher dans index irrigation trigger threshold of 1 c observed and selected in 2018 which required more water stress to trigger irrigation than other methods during the late vegetative and mid reproductive growth stages although the ctm method responded to cumulative stress and triggered irrigation in the later part of 2018 it was evident that this late timing of the irrigation negatively impacted table 5 crop yield table 6 studies by han et al 2018 and lena et al 2020 noted limitations of early season leaf area index coupled with soil background and late season crop senescing in the computation of cwsi for maize therefore the onset of early senescence prior to meeting a crop s full water demand could be a drawback to utilizing ctm based measurements in irrigation water management additionally payero et al 2009 found that irrigation stress timed during the reproductive stage for maize grown in the same research site resulted in 17 33 of yield variation the detection of crop water stress as well as the proper timing of an irrigation event were therefore key indicators of a scheduling method s appropriateness to manage irrigation even though the irrigation threshold was lowered from 1 0 to 0 5 c following 2018 it was kept constant throughout the growing season yet crop response to water stress was likely to vary across growth stages thermal stress thresholds and baselines alike have typically been kept unvarying throughout the growing season unlike in soil monitoring where variables like mad are adjusted to accommodate for crop growth and associated stress an in season dynamic threshold model for cwsi was developed by osroosh et al 2015 to monitor water stress in apple trees and it was found that the dynamic cwsi thresholds evaded false irrigation triggers while accounting for growth changes in trees in all three growing seasons the ctm irrigation events were triggered after the smm and etm methods which alluded to early season mining of awc prior to the method s triggering of irrigation starting water application later in the season compared to other methods suggested that irrigation events triggered by the ctm were likely to happen at or after the onset of crop water stress and the method was likely better suited for di practices the smm cumulatively applied 166 61 and 244 mm of irrigation in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively the higher irrigation amount in 2020 resonated with the season s drier than normal climate which created a greater need for water as compared to 2018 and 2019 although the seasonal irrigation initiation and timings of smm was similar to the etm method there was a significantly higher application of water by the etm method specifically 19 100 and 33 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively while the etm method may be an easier method to apply the method is prone to incremental errors in estimation of water depletion in the soil gu et al 2020 and runoff uncertainty an alternative to stand alone scheduling methods could therefore be combining methods together to maximize their advantages as an example a combined approach could include measurement of the soil water and translation of these measurements into the irrigation decision smm method while considering crop water needs and soil s water holding capacity etm method also methods can be implemented concurrently parallel application or utilization of one method after the other series application depending on which strategy best identifies crop water stress along changing crop growth stages a cost benefit analysis of duo or multiple scheduling method application ought to be considered prior to adoption 3 4 soil water dynamics the initial total water tw content following recharge from the off season precipitation october to april amongst the three scheduling treatments ranged from 533 to 553 11 mm in 2018 492 461 20 mm in 2019 and 428 450 11 mm in 2020 fig 5 although there were notable interannual differences in initial tw due to variation of previous season and off season precipitation in season initial values of tw were within a similar magnitude range across the experimental treatments since the rainfall received during the season was assumed to be constant across the treatments subsequent in season variations in soil water content were primarily attributed to irrigation water applied there was evidence of a greater separation of tw values of the ctm method compared to the smm and etm methods in 2018 also early season tw values were lower for the ctm compared to the di and ri treatments these low magnitude tw values in the ctm treatment were attributed to reduced frequency of irrigation events as triggered by the ctm method in the early portion of 2018 due to the high dans index canopy stress threshold of 1 0 c in 2018 the end of season tw for the smm was 40 mm less than that for the etm which was influenced by fewer irrigation events this difference suggested that the smm allowed for potential extraction of soil water by the roots from deeper soil layers which reduced irrigation drawing down of water in the soil profile could save on application of irrigation water and provide a greater storage volume for off season precipitation which could be utilized by crops in subsequent growing seasons the 2019 growing season received above normal rainfall of 580 mm table 2 which resulted in less irrigation water applied across treatments but on average a higher amount of end of season tw across the soil profiles of the treatment plots compared to 2018 and 2020 the 2019 beginning and ending tw values for the scheduling treatments ranged from 498 to 315 for smm 492 326 mm for etm and 461 394 mm for ctm scheduling methods the ctm end of season tw value was greater than that of the other treatments in 2019 including the ei treatment 334 mm indicating that more irrigation events than agronomically viable were triggered for the ctm method this irrigation application error suggested that deciding on an appropriate irrigation cutoff date which considers soil water status and a crops growth stage was essential it also suggested that crop canopy thermal response was possibly varied across crop developmental stages these possible differences in dans index values ought to be accounted for in baseline development irrigation threshold selection and irrigation cutoff timing for subsequent studies the drier than normal growing season of 2020 experienced a steady decline in soil tw across all treatments fig 5 despite more applied irrigation than 2018 and 2019 crop water demand driven by both increased soil and atmospheric water deficits were key contributors to the low tw values the combination of the irrigation water trends and soil tw variations across treatments suggested that prompt detection of crop water stress influenced irrigation triggering and scheduling from this research the three main indicators that infer crop water stress in a suggested chronological order of occurrence can be stated as i microclimatic evaporative demand ii soil moisture decline and iii crop thermal physiological response if all other factors are kept constant then the implications could be that the etm and smm methods were more likely to trigger irrigation concurrently while the ctm method triggered irrigation in response to an already experienced degree of crop water stress the instances where all methods trigger at a time could suggest that the ctm was responding to a crop water stress episode experienced previously rather than presently these observations regarding timing of irrigation and influences could imply that the ctm method if solely used is best suited to manage deficit irrigation rather than fully irrigated cropping systems this deduction of use of ctm methods is so because crop water stress is required to have occurred before it s detected by the ctm method hence even in cases when water stress is detected at the onset full irrigation coupled with non stress conditions can never be fully met which renders the ctm methods as one best for deficit irrigation practices 3 5 dans variation with percentage soil water depletion to investigate the relationship between the dans index and soil water dans was linearly compared with percent soil water depletion in the 2020 growing season on neutron based soil water measurement dates at depths of 0 6 1 8 and 2 1 m fig 6 the comparison was made under two percent depletion levels i e below 60 depletion and above 60 depletion which were denoted as below and above respectively stronger linear relationships with dans were observed for percent depletion values above 60 compared to percent depletion below 60 across the measurement depths table 6 dans was slightly correlated with percent depletion below 60 at 1 8 m depth compared to the other depths with a r2 value of 0 33 and 0 028 c slope rise for every percent increase in depletion the 1 8 m depth was within the active maize crop root zone and this relationship evidenced that the dans index was able to characterize soil water status albeit weakly at 60 soil water depletion at a percent depletion greater than 60 dans values were strongly correlated with percent depletion values with r2 values of 0 78 0 71 and 0 70 at 0 6 1 8 and 2 1 m respectively the correlation of the index at higher depletion levels across soil depths suggested that the dans index was best suited to manage irrigation under deficit and or water stress conditions similarly katimbo et al 2022 discussed that the maize crop cwsi was better correlated with soil water depletion greater than 80 extreme values of dans and the corresponding near out of range percent depletion values were observed in the ri treatments fig 6 in addition to soil water dynamics these extreme values are likely to correlate highly with other factors such as daily weather conditions and it is suggested to further investigate the sensitivity of the dans index with key weather based parameters as well as effect of crop growth stage 3 6 crop yield response across the irrigation scheduling methods the variation of the yield and iwp across the scheduling treatments is shown in table 6 the average yield across the smm etm and ctm irrigation scheduling treatments was 16 72 1 45 14 51 0 71 and 15 27 0 92 mg ha 1 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively in all three growing seasons the scheduled treatments yields were greater in magnitude and significantly different from the rf treatment interannual differences in yield values were also observed within similar scheduling method treatments irmak 2015 discussed that variations of yield across years for the same experimental treatment was attributed to seasonal climate differences despite the irrigation differences amongst the smm etm and ei treatments in 2019 as discussed in section 3 3 the grain yield for these three treatments was not significantly different p 0 05 table 6 additionally the ctm method s grain yield was not statistically different from that of the etm method in 2019 despite having applied significantly more irrigation water since 2019 was a wetter than normal year the statistical influence of irrigation and effect of scheduling method was indistinct in 2020 the smm and ctm where statistically similar p 0 05 while the etm was similar to the ei treatment the ctm scheduling method based on the dans index performed best under dry conditions in which the method was more suited to identify crop water stress irrigation water productivity values averaged across the scheduling treatments varied from 3 10 0 09 1 64 0 47 and 2 92 0 30 kg m 3 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively in all the experimental seasons the iwp decreased with applied irrigation water similar to findings presented by klocke et al 2007 lo et al 2019 and payero et al 2008 at the same location the ctm treatment had the least value of iwp in 2019 because excess irrigation coupled with the wetter than normal rainfall patterns reduced the impact of irrigation on grain yield during the normal year of 2018 the iwp were statistically similar across the scheduling treatments while in the wetter year of 2019 smm and ctm were similar to the etm model but not to each other significant differences in iwp across scheduling treatments occurred in 2020 with the ctm treatment having the greatest value since higher values of iwp indicated lower irrigation inputs per grain yield produced growers under water limited conditions might opt for irrigation scheduling methods that maximize iwp for optimal profitability payero et al 2008 for instance the ctm method had a larger value of iwp in 2020 which could suggest that it was a suitable method for irrigation in limited water conditions the reliability of iwp as reference metric for irrigation method performance may however only be limited to the dry growing season of 2020 where majority of the water applied contributes to crop evaporation with minimum runoff and or deep percolation losses djaman and irmak 2012 hence the evaluation of irrigation scheduling methods in the wetter years requires alternative reference metrics 3 7 practical considerations for application of dans index based irrigation scheduling the transferability of the dans index to other regions for irrigation water management is likely to be influenced by climatic and site specific factors for example it is postulated that for similar climatic conditions there will be a gradual increase in the dans index values in heavy clay soils which have a greater water holding capacity compared to a rapid increase of dans values in sandy soils with low water holding capacities in sandier soils crops are more prone to incur water stress faster which will be detected by the dans index and will require frequent but shallow depths of application to avoid loss via percolation on the other hand crops planted on heavy clay soils which can accommodate deeper depth of irrigation water are likely to experience and indicate high dans index values at a later time comparison of the thermal response of crops across soil types in localized and generalized settings is a research line to be investigated considering climate the numerical difference between the stressed and non stressed baseline temperature is greater in arid compared to humid and sub humid regions which also corresponds to a greater evaporative demand in the arid regions compared to humid regions as such a unit increase in canopy temperature above the non stressed baseline temperature in humid regions likely accounts for greater stress level compared to that in arid regions as such it is hypothesized that the dans index threshold for a given crop will be lower in humid compared to arid regions to account for the same degree of stress further infield investigations are required to test this hypothesis it is also important to note that the dans index is only reflective of a point in time water stress intensity level further work to explore cumulative changes in dans index over time and how these related to water stress indictors such as soil moisture are also recommended it was also hypothesized that since the dans index varied across growth stages growth specific baselines and trigger thresholds could further improve the method 4 conclusions this study evaluated the performance of canopy temperature based ctm irrigation scheduling using the degrees above non stressed dans index as compared to commonly applied soil moisture monitoring smm and crop et model etm based irrigation scheduling techniques under semi arid climatic conditions in three growing seasons of 2018 2019 and 2020 this study used a modeled non stressed canopy temperature t cns in the computation of the dans index and the comparison between the modeled and field observed t cns had coefficient of determination r2 values of 0 88 0 81 and 0 84 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively the utilization of a modeled rather than an observed t cns could further ease the application and adoption of thermal indices specifically the dans index in crop water stress monitoring also the dans index matched closely to cwsi a conventionally used thermal indicator of crop water stress with r2 values of 0 64 0 61 and 0 75 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively in 2018 and 2019 the grain yields from the smm and etm methods were statistically similar but different from the ctm method while in 2020 the grain yield of the smm and ctm were statistically comparable but dissimilar from those of the etm treatment across the scheduling treatments more irrigation water was applied during the 2020 dry year and the ctm method had the highest iwp of the scheduling treatments on the other hand the iwp was statistically similar for the scheduling treatments in the normal 2018 year these differences in dry compared to wet and normal years further authenticated that ctm based irrigation scheduling was better suited for deficit irrigation conditions for irrigation scheduling the selected thermal index thresholds played a great role in irrigation efficiency for the ctm method and lowering the dans index trigger threshold from 1 0 to 0 5 c improved the method s performance in 2020 under the experiment conditions the dans index values were observed to vary across crop growth stage in this study and it is therefore suggested that growth stage based irrigation trigger threshold values could be adopted for example growth stage specific thresholds could be set lower in the early season to capture onset of water stress but increase overtime to reflect crop s increased root zone as well as early senescence based on observation of the dans crop growth stage variations in this study threshold value range could be characterized as 0 4 c dans threshold 0 5 c during high water sensitive growth stages tasseling and silking dans threshold 0 5 c post silking to mid reproductive growth stages and 0 5 c dans threshold 1 c in late reproductive stage the testing of growth stage based thresholds and baselines is suggested for future research acknowledgements the authors are grateful to turner dorr jacob nickel von fritsche and

of biological systems engineering university of nebraska lincoln lincoln ne usa handling editor dr r thompson irrigation scheduling methods have been used to determine the timing and amount of water applied to crops scheduling techniques can include measurement of soil water content quantification of crop water use and monitoring of crop physiological response to water stress the aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of a simplified crop canopy temperature measurement ctm method as irrigation principles soil and water conservation engineera technique to schedule irrigation for maize specifically the degrees above non stressed dans index which suggests water stress when canopy temperature exceeds the non stressed canopy temperature t cns was determined by estimating tcns from a weather based multilinear regression model the modeled tcns had a strong correlation with observed t cns with a pooled r2 values of 0 94 across the 2018 2019 and 2020 growing seasons this dans index was also highly correlated with the conventionally used crop water stress index cwsi with r2 values of 0 67 0 59 and 0 76 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively furthermore dans had a strong linear relationship with soil water depletion above 60 in the 0 60 m soil profile with an r2 of 0 78 the ctm method was also compared to more commonly used scheduling methods namely soil moisture monitoring smm and crop evapotranspiration modeling etm grain yield was significantly lower for the ctm method than for the etm method in 2018 and 2020 but not in 2019 no significant differences were observed in irrigation water productivity iwp in 2018 however all treatments were significantly different with the ctm method having the greatest iwp in 2020 for attempting to trigger full irrigation with the ctm method a fixed dans threshold of 0 5 c was found to be more appropriate than the literature value of 1 0 c but consideration of crop growth stage would further improve scheduling keywords canopy temperature crop water stress index evapotranspiration irrigation water productivity soil water content data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global population growth is anticipated to rise to an estimate of 9 2 billion people in 2050 which will consequently increase demand on available food sources and associated agricultural production resources particularly water jury and vaux 2007 stewardship of current water resources therefore necessitates adaptable and innovative methodologies to optimize water use while efficiently meeting demands such as agricultural production for this increasing population in water limited environments such stewardship includes development and adoption of irrigation water management methods and technologies to determine proper timing and depth of irrigation irrigation scheduling methods and technologies include soil moisture monitoring smm plant sensors proximal sensors daily evapotranspiration modeling etm visual observation mimicking neighbors and feel of soil among others usda nass 2019 rudnick et al 2020 unfortunately however these methods vary widely in their ability to match irrigation with crop water needs rudnick et al 2020 for instance a variety of sensors can be used in smm to quantify soil attributes and associate them to soil water content within the crop root zone evett et al 2012 lekshmi et al 2014 typically smm methods involve the estimation of volumetric soil water content θ v which is maintained above a trigger threshold often based on the management allowable depletion mad concept the θ v measurements are influenced by instrument accuracy and must consider soil physical characteristics and crop development and rooting depth which are complex parameters to estimate when scheduling irrigation evett et al 2012 gu et al 2020 taghvaeian et al 2020 recently developed smm measuring tools are also limited by their ability to represent large spatial areas at continuous temporal scales while long established methods such as the neutron moisture meter nmm and gravimetric soil sampling are not widely utilized outside the academic research community due to complexity in application and associated costs evett et al 2012 alternatively etm and soil water balance based models have been employed to estimate crop water use and this information is utilized to quantify how much water is needed to replenish the root zone storage via irrigation huffman et al 2013 anderson and french 2019 gu et al 2020 however the accuracy of model input parameters can affect the correctness of crop etm based irrigation water management methods model inaccuracies are likely to arise from imprecise soil physical property estimation inexact measurements of microclimate and resulting reference evapotranspiration et r and or the use of generic crop coefficient k c values gu et al 2020 emerging irrigation water management techniques such as canopy temperature measurement ctm using infrared thermometers have been described as a non destructive affordable means to spatially and temporally monitor crop water stress for irrigation management jones 2004 dejonge et al 2015 o shaughnessy et al 2015 ihuoma and madramootoo 2017 commonly the crop water stress index cwsi idso et al 1981 has successfully been used to monitor water stress in a variety of crops including sorghum o shaughnessy et al 2012 sugarbeet king et al 2021 maize payero and irmak 2006 and soybean payero and irmak 2006 however adoption of cwsi as an irrigation scheduling method has been limited because its computation requires establishment or modeling of non stressed and maximally stressed crop conditions along with concurrent measurements of air temperature and relative humidity dejonge et al 2015 alternatively simplified crop thermal indices such as degrees above non stressed dans have been developed by relating observed canopy temperature t c to a single non stressed canopy baseline temperature t cns taghvaeian et al 2014 although this dans method has been used for monitoring water stress in maize dejonge et al 2015 and sunflower taghvaeian et al 2014 in arid environments there is opportunity to test the method s viability and transferability in different climatic regions to establish appropriate scheduling protocols and index thresholds furthermore while initial t cns baselines were suggested by maintaining and monitoring a non stressed reference area dejonge et al 2015 increased access to weather datasets presents an opportunity to alternatively model the t cns which could further simplify the computation of the dans index and increase the method s adoption as an irrigation water management tool by farmers this study was therefore focused on the implementation of ctm specifically the dans index as a real time irrigation water management tool in semi arid mid western united states and highlights the method s development implementation and outcomes e g applied irrigation yield response and performance metrics this will contribute to the resources pool that water managers can consider reviewing as they determine which irrigation water management method to adopt in semi arid environments additionally the dans index method was compared to the conventional smm and etm methods under similar environments and agronomic practices the selection of irrigation water management methods to investigate was based on a technique s extensive usage in research smm method common application amongst farmers etm method and contemporary scheduling approaches used in recent years ctm method the study objectives were 1 to develop and evaluate an empirical non stressed canopy baseline t cns for the degrees above non stressed dans index 2 to compare the dans index against conventional canopy temperature measurement method cwsi and 3 to evaluate the effectiveness of the dans index against soil water monitoring and evapotranspiration

2019 and 2020 respectively using a john deere model 9500 combine with a calibrated yield monitor a randomized complete block design was implemented consisting of four blocks each having 9 m by 72 m experimental plots three irrigation scheduling treatments were evaluated namely soil moisture monitoring smm crop evapotranspiration model etm and canopy temperature measurement ctm irrigation of 20 mm was applied when a treatment triggered to further evaluate the three scheduling methods it was necessary to compare the method s performances with a non irrigated low irrigated and excessively irrigated crops the experiment design therefore included treatments managed under different irrigation levels namely rainfed rf which received no irrigation water deficit irrigation di and excess irrigation ei the di and ei treatments were 60 12 mm and 140 28 mm of the smm treatment respectively and followed the irrigation timing of the smm treatment the di and ei treatments were included to properly evaluate whether the three irrigation treatments under optimally or over irrigated as determined by the crop production function the experimental units were individually irrigated by a subsurface drip irrigated sdi system the sdi system consisted of laterals drip lines spaced at 1 52 m under alternate furrows and at a depth of 0 4 m below the soil surface the drip tape type was t

term seasonal total of 8 8 15 9 and 10 5 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively which suggested a greater evaporative demand and need for irrigation in 2020 in comparison to 2018 and 2019 furthermore the corresponding rainfall totals from may 1 to october 31 were 432 503 and 235 mm in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively these seasonal totals translated in 19 8 and 39 5 increase in rainfall above long term average in 2018 and 2019 as compared to a 34 9 decline in 2020 these weather parameter differences suggested a drier than average year in 2020 a wetter than average year in 2019 and a slightly wetter

tube was placed within a crop row in three plots of each treatment in 2019 and 2020 a pair of access tubes were placed in four plots of each treatment with the two tubes straddling a crop row evenly and being 0 38 m apart perpendicular to the row direction canopy temperature measurements were taken using si 1h1 and si 4hi series infrared thermometers irt sensors apogee instruments inc ut usa due to limitations in sensor availability an irt sensor was installed in three smm plots every year but in two ctm plots for 2018 and three ctm plots for 2019 and 2020 there were no irt sensors installed in the etm treatment the irt sensors were mounted approximately 1 m above the crop canopy and oriented at a 45 view angle towards the crop to maximize the viewing of sunlit crop canopy during mid afternoon hours the irts were oriented in the northeast direction the sensors were programmed to collect data every six seconds which was averaged over one minute and sampled using cr1000 measurement

effective root zone in the vegetative to early reproductive growth stages for irrigation management in this study following kranz et al 2008 and the root zone was expanded to 1 22 m in the late reproductive season to allow for extraction of water from a deeper soil depth yonts et al 2008 the soil available water content awc was computed as 1 awc i n θ fci θ wpi d i θ fcn θ wpn d n where θ fc is the volumetric water content at field capacity fc m3 m 3 θ wp is the volumetric water content at wilting point wp m3 m 3 and d is the soil depth ranging from i to n within the limits of the managed maize crop root depth as determined by the crop growth stage depending on the crop growth stage the allowable depletion ad value varied to reflect the crop s ability to extract water and tolerate water stress prior to irrigation events these ad values were developed based off near optimal irrigation management conditions for maize at the research site in 2017 lo et al 2019 which took into account the crop growth stage and approximate rooting depth the ad values ranged from 27 4 mm at fifth leaf v5 to 152 4 mm at kernel dent r5 75 growth stage table 3 the difference between the average volumetric water content θ v across the 0 91 m soil profile and θ fc across the managed rooting depth was computed and denoted as the real time depletion value rtd eq 2 a decision to irrigate was made

in table 3 daily maize et a was measured from an onsite eddy covariance system the field was fully fertilized and irrigated and extended 230 m south of the tower the system was installed with a maximum instrument height of 3 96 m which allowed for a 1 m height above canopy latent heat flux data processing and filtering accounting for only the footprint from the maize field was done by li cor

using onsite weather data collected by the nebraska mesonet https mesonet unl edu the resultant kc values were compared to kc values previously measured at the experiment site gerosa 2011 and within the experiment region hinkle et al 1984 and were found to be similar and representative of a well watered maize crop 2 3 3 canopy temperature measurement ctm degrees above non stressed dans thermal index was used as the ctm irrigation scheduling method the computation of dans eq 5 ideally requires the maintenance of a well watered non stressed crop which is contrasted with the canopy temperature measured from the study treatments taghvaeian et al 2014 dejonge et al 2015 kullberg et al 2017 drechsler et al 2019 the maintenance of a well water crop necessitates constant monitoring and frequent irrigation of the crop to prevent water stress yet irrigation system limitations amongst other constraints may be encountered additionally the non stressed crop ideally needs to be monitored for each growing season to reflect ongoing atmospheric demand to satisfy the requirement of a non stressed canopy baseline dejonge et al 2015 considered the lowest observed temperature from available treatments as the t cns in both cwsi and dans index computations alternatively this study suggested that a modeled non stressed temperature be used to approximate the well watered crop conditions for the dans index 5 dans t c t cns a multilinear regression model was used to estimate t cns dependent variable with weather parameters t a r s and vapor pressure deficit vpd as the independent variables the lowest observed peak time 14 45 16 45 central daylight time utc 5 t c measurements amongst treatments starting after 80 canopy closure were used in the regression analysis and model development peak time t c measurements were selected because greater standard deviations in measured t c were observed across the treatments in comparison to those observed in the early morning or late night hours of the day data not shown this diurnal variation in maize t c values was also observed in research conducted by dejonge et al 2015 and suggested that spot thermal indices could be computed from temperature data collected 1 2 h after solar noon the multilinear regression was done using r 3 5 0 r core team 2018 packages while the correlation statistics were computed in microsoft excel 365 microsoft corporation redmond wa usa the coefficients of the selected predictor parameters were significant at a p value of 0 05 to the model the data was filtered to remove cloudy day conditions as well as dates when vpd values were less than 1 kpa in 2018 data from the 2017 growing season was used in the model while in 2019 and 2020 the model included data sets from both 2017 and 2018 table 4 the resulting model rmse values were 0 46 and 0 38 c in 2018 and 2019 respectively maize was considered minimally moderately and severely stressed at dans values of 1 0 c 1 0 5 0 c and 5 0 8 3 c respectively in a previous study in colorado dejonge et al 2015 in the current study an irrigation threshold of 1 c was selected in 2018 but this threshold was later lowered to 0 5 c in 2019 and 2020 to better capture and respond to the onset of crop water stress the difference between the observed field measured t c and modeled t cns was compared to the selected dans index threshold value prior to making an irrigation decision an irrigation decision was therefore made when the computed dans value exceeded the set threshold i e 1 c in 2018 and 0 5 c in 2019 and 2020 2 4 crop water stress

stress as a function of thermal measurement and environment in this research the computed dans index was compared to empirically established cwsi index following idso et al 1981 eq 6 1 the lower

measurements of canopy temperature from the deficit and rainfed treatments 2 5 performance assessment and statistical analysis differences in grain yield across irrigation scheduling treatments and

independence of variables and homogeneity of variances the fisher s protected least significance difference test was performed at 95 significance level in addition the impact of irrigation scheduling

temperature and seasonal dans index variation a multilinear regression table 4 was used to model the non stressed canopy temperature baseline which was required for the computation of the dans index the coefficient of determination r2 values for the regression between the peak time observed t cns and modeled t cns on non cloudy days were 0 95 0 94 and 0 96 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively fig 1 the corresponding growing season rmse values were 0 46 0 55 and 0 41 c in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively the higher rmse values observed in 2019 which was the wetter growing season suggest that modeling of t cns did not perform as well in wetter than average conditions at the experiment site despite this the overall goodness of fit across the three experimental years suggested that modeled t cns could be used in substitution to field measured t cns during the computation of the dans index this model based t cns could therefore further ease the adoption and application of the dans index method for irrigation scheduling the variation in the dans index per treatment contrasted against the selected thermal threshold values during the growing seasons of 2018 2019 and 2020 are presented in fig 2 in 2018 a trigger threshold value of 1 0 c was selected for the dans index while in 2018 and 2020 the trigger threshold was 0 5 c in 2018 the dans index for the ctm treatment in july was closer in magnitude to the di treatment than to smm treatment in which irrigation was managed to maintain full crop et this delay in irrigation i e greater crop water stress by the ctm treatment in 2018 was due to the higher stress threshold selected the dans seasonal values ranged from 2 c to over 8 c across the three different growing seasons higher dans index values were observed in the rf treatment after the r4 growth stage at the onset of crop senescence taghvaeian et al 2014 reported dans values slightly over 8 c and those below 0 c for sunflower during different measurement times in the peak period and the negative values are assumed to indicate non water stressed conditions the 2019 growing season received above normal rainfall which resulted in less water stress and subsequently overall lower magnitude dans values across the treatments the season was also characterized with days that had vpd values of less than 1 kpa for which the dans index was not computed for irrigation scheduling therefore the greatest spread in dans index values was observed in 2020 which was a dry year while the above normal rainfall year of 2019 had the least difference in dans values across treatments the difference in dans values indicated that the index was responsive to irrigation and could be used to infer crop water stress slightly higher early season v6 growth stage dans values in 2019 could be attributed to partial view of the soil surface by the irt sensor prior to full canopy closure while the late season peak dans values across the seasons were associated with crop maturity and onset of senescence these higher range dans values were not considered for the dans index based irrigation scheduling which renders that method unusable prior to full canopy closure or at the end of the growing season if the need for irrigation water is warranted in 2018 and 2019 there were slight differences in magnitude of dans values during the early season v8 to vt due to reduced early crop water demand on the other hand the v8 to vt dans values across treatments in 2020 were greater reflecting the dry nature of the growing season the mid reproductive season r2 to r3 in 2018 and 2019 indicated difference in dans values which could be attributed to differences in irrigation water applied as determined by the scheduling method the extreme dry conditions in 2020 resulted in concurrent irrigation triggering by both the smm and ctm treatments hence the lower differences in magnitude of dans values during the r3 to r4 growth stages greatest differences in dans were observed during the later reproductive stage r4 especially in the rf treatment which was attributed to early senescence these in season variations in dans values with growth stages suggested that a static dans threshold as the one used in the study was likely to under or overestimate stress along the growing season 3 2 cswi dans relationship the correlations between conventionally used cwsi and the dans index for the rf di smm and ctm treatments are presented in fig 3 the resulting correlation coefficients across the three experiment seasons were 0 67 0 59 and 0 75 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively this correlation of the dans index computed using modeled tcns to conventionally used thermal stress cwsi suggested that dans could also be used for crop water monitoring and irrigation scheduling taghvaeian et al 2014 found that the correlation coefficients of cwsi and dans for sunflower ranged from 0 80 to 0 86 across different hourly periods and that dans was responsive to irrigation the relationship between cwsi and dans was stronger in the drier 2020 growing season which also had higher average t c values across the treatments the increased correlation in the drier growing season suggested that both indices were more responsive to crop water stress in water limited conditions similarly dejonge et al 2015 reported a correlation coefficient of 0 50 for mean canopy temperatures between 27 c and 29 c and a higher correlation coefficient of 0 90 between cwsi and dans for mean canopy temperatures greater than 29 c in maize 3 3 seasonal irrigation patterns across scheduling treatments seasonal cumulative irrigation as applied by the three scheduling methods juxtaposed with rainfall and crop growth stage is presented in fig 4 the ctm method triggered irrigation later in the season during the mid reproductive growth stage in 2018 and a cumulative total of 102 mm was applied the amount was relatively lower in magnitude than that applied by the smm 166 mm and etm 193 mm methods given the same environmental and soil physical conditions this underestimation of irrigation water requirement was attributed to the higher dans index irrigation trigger threshold of 1 c observed and selected in 2018 which required more water stress to trigger irrigation than other methods during the late vegetative and mid reproductive growth stages although the ctm method responded to cumulative stress and triggered irrigation in the later part of 2018 it was evident that this late timing of the irrigation negatively impacted table 5 crop yield table 6 studies by han et al 2018 and lena et al 2020 noted limitations of early season leaf area index coupled with soil background and late season crop senescing in the computation of cwsi for maize therefore the onset of early senescence prior to meeting a crop s full water demand could be a drawback to utilizing ctm based measurements in irrigation water management additionally payero et al 2009 found that irrigation stress timed during the reproductive stage for maize grown in the same research site resulted in 17 33 of yield variation the detection of crop water stress as well as the proper timing of an irrigation event were therefore key indicators of a scheduling method s appropriateness to manage irrigation even though the irrigation threshold was lowered from 1 0 to 0 5 c following 2018 it was kept constant throughout the growing season yet crop response to water stress was likely to vary across growth stages thermal stress thresholds and baselines alike have typically been kept unvarying throughout the growing season unlike in soil monitoring where variables like mad are adjusted to accommodate for crop growth and associated stress an in season dynamic threshold model for cwsi was developed by osroosh et al 2015 to monitor water stress in apple trees and it was found that the dynamic cwsi thresholds evaded false irrigation triggers while accounting for growth changes in trees in all three growing seasons the ctm irrigation events were triggered after the smm and etm methods which alluded to early season mining of awc prior to the method s triggering of irrigation starting water application later in the season compared to other methods suggested that irrigation events triggered by the ctm were likely to happen at or after the onset of crop water stress and the method was likely better suited for di practices the smm cumulatively applied 166 61 and 244 mm of irrigation in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively the higher irrigation amount in 2020 resonated with the season s drier than normal climate which created a greater need for water as compared to 2018 and 2019 although the seasonal irrigation initiation and timings of smm was similar to the etm method there was a significantly higher application of water by the etm method specifically 19 100 and 33 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively while the etm method may be an easier method to apply the method is prone to incremental errors in estimation of water depletion in the soil gu et al 2020 and runoff uncertainty an alternative to stand alone scheduling methods could therefore be combining methods together to maximize their advantages as an example a combined approach could include measurement of the soil water and translation of these measurements into the irrigation decision smm method while considering crop water needs and soil s water holding capacity etm method also methods can be implemented concurrently parallel application or utilization of one method after the other series application depending on which strategy best identifies crop water stress along changing crop growth stages a cost benefit analysis of duo or multiple scheduling method application ought to be considered prior to adoption 3 4 soil water dynamics the initial total water tw content following recharge from the off season precipitation october to april amongst the three scheduling treatments ranged from 533 to 553 11 mm in 2018 492 461 20 mm in 2019 and 428 450 11 mm in 2020 fig 5 although there were notable interannual differences in initial tw due to variation of previous season and off season precipitation in season initial values of tw were within a similar magnitude range across the experimental treatments since the rainfall received during the season was assumed to be constant across the treatments subsequent in season variations in soil water content were primarily attributed to irrigation water applied there was evidence of a greater separation of tw values of the ctm method compared to the smm and etm methods in 2018 also early season tw values were lower for the ctm compared to the di and ri treatments these low magnitude tw values in the ctm treatment were attributed to reduced frequency of irrigation events as triggered by the ctm method in the early portion of 2018 due to the high dans index canopy stress threshold of 1 0 c in 2018 the end of season tw for the smm was 40 mm less than that for the etm which was influenced by fewer irrigation events this difference suggested that the smm allowed for potential extraction of soil water by the roots from deeper soil layers which reduced irrigation drawing down of water in the soil profile could save on application of irrigation water and provide a greater storage volume for off season precipitation which could be utilized by crops in subsequent growing seasons the 2019 growing season received above normal rainfall of 580 mm table 2 which resulted in less irrigation water applied across treatments but on average a higher amount of end of season tw across the soil profiles of the treatment plots compared to 2018 and 2020 the 2019 beginning and ending tw values for the scheduling treatments ranged from 498 to 315 for smm 492 326 mm for etm and 461 394 mm for ctm scheduling methods the ctm end of season tw value was greater than that of the other treatments in 2019 including the ei treatment 334 mm indicating that more irrigation events than agronomically viable were triggered for the ctm method this irrigation application error suggested that deciding on an appropriate irrigation cutoff date which considers soil water status and a crops growth stage was essential it also suggested that crop canopy thermal response was possibly varied across crop developmental stages these possible differences in dans index values ought to be accounted for in baseline development irrigation threshold selection and irrigation cutoff timing for subsequent studies the drier than normal growing season of 2020 experienced a steady decline in soil tw across all treatments fig 5 despite more applied irrigation than 2018 and 2019 crop water demand driven by both increased soil and atmospheric water deficits were key contributors to the low tw values the combination of the irrigation water trends and soil tw variations across treatments suggested that prompt detection of crop water stress influenced irrigation triggering and scheduling from this research the three main indicators that infer crop water stress in a suggested chronological order of occurrence can be stated as i microclimatic evaporative demand ii soil moisture decline and iii crop thermal physiological response if all other factors are kept constant then the implications could be that the etm and smm methods were more likely to trigger irrigation concurrently while the ctm method triggered irrigation in response to an already experienced degree of crop water stress the instances where all methods trigger at a time could suggest that the ctm was responding to a crop water stress episode experienced previously rather than presently these observations regarding timing of irrigation and influences could imply that the ctm method if solely used is best suited to manage deficit irrigation rather than fully irrigated cropping systems this deduction of use of ctm methods is so because crop water stress is required to have occurred before it s detected by the ctm method hence even in cases when water stress is detected at the onset full irrigation coupled with non stress conditions can never be fully met which renders the ctm methods as one best for deficit irrigation practices 3 5 dans variation with percentage soil water depletion to investigate the relationship between the dans index and soil water dans was linearly compared with percent soil water depletion in the 2020 growing season on neutron based soil water measurement dates at depths of 0 6 1 8 and 2 1 m fig 6 the comparison was made under two percent depletion levels i e below 60 depletion and above 60 depletion which were denoted as below and above respectively stronger linear relationships with dans were observed for percent depletion values above 60 compared to percent depletion below 60 across the measurement depths table 6 dans was slightly correlated with percent depletion below 60 at 1 8 m depth compared to the other depths with a r2 value of 0 33 and 0 028 c slope rise for every percent increase in depletion the 1 8 m depth was within the active maize crop root zone and this relationship evidenced that the dans index was able to characterize soil water status albeit weakly at 60 soil water depletion at a percent depletion greater than 60 dans values were strongly correlated with percent depletion values with r2 values of 0 78 0 71 and 0 70 at 0 6 1 8 and 2 1 m respectively the correlation of the index at higher depletion levels across soil depths suggested that the dans index was best suited to manage irrigation under deficit and or water stress conditions similarly katimbo et al 2022 discussed that the maize crop cwsi was better correlated with soil water depletion greater than 80 extreme values of dans and the corresponding near out of range percent depletion values were observed in the ri treatments fig 6 in addition to soil water dynamics these extreme values are likely to correlate highly with other factors such as daily weather conditions and it is suggested to further investigate the sensitivity of the dans index with key weather based parameters as well as effect of crop growth stage 3 6 crop yield response across the irrigation scheduling methods the variation of the yield and iwp across the scheduling treatments is shown in table 6 the average yield across the smm etm and ctm irrigation scheduling treatments was 16 72 1 45 14 51 0 71 and 15 27 0 92 mg ha 1 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively in all three growing seasons the scheduled treatments yields were greater in magnitude and significantly different from the rf treatment interannual differences in yield values were also observed within similar scheduling method treatments irmak 2015 discussed that variations of yield across years for the same experimental treatment was attributed to seasonal climate differences despite the irrigation differences amongst the smm etm and ei treatments in 2019 as discussed in section 3 3 the grain yield for these three treatments was not significantly different p 0 05 table 6 additionally the ctm method s grain yield was not statistically different from that of the etm method in 2019 despite having applied significantly more irrigation water since 2019 was a wetter than normal year the statistical influence of irrigation and effect of scheduling method was indistinct in 2020 the smm and ctm where statistically similar p 0 05 while the etm was similar to the ei treatment the ctm scheduling method based on the dans index performed best under dry conditions in which the method was more suited to identify crop water stress irrigation water productivity values averaged across the scheduling treatments varied from 3 10 0 09 1 64 0 47 and 2 92 0 30 kg m 3 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively in all the experimental seasons the iwp decreased with applied irrigation water similar to findings presented by klocke et al 2007 lo et al 2019 and payero et al 2008 at the same location the ctm treatment had the least value of iwp in 2019 because excess irrigation coupled with the wetter than normal rainfall patterns reduced the impact of irrigation on grain yield during the normal year of 2018 the iwp were statistically similar across the scheduling treatments while in the wetter year of 2019 smm and ctm were similar to the etm model but not to each other significant differences in iwp across scheduling treatments occurred in 2020 with the ctm treatment having the greatest value since higher values of iwp indicated lower irrigation inputs per grain yield produced growers under water limited conditions might opt for irrigation scheduling methods that maximize iwp for optimal profitability payero et al 2008 for instance the ctm method had a larger value of iwp in 2020 which could suggest that it was a suitable method for irrigation in limited water conditions the reliability of iwp as reference metric for irrigation method performance may however only be limited to the dry growing season of 2020 where majority of the water applied contributes to crop evaporation with minimum runoff and or deep percolation losses djaman and irmak 2012 hence the evaluation of irrigation scheduling methods in the wetter years requires alternative reference metrics 3 7 practical considerations for application of dans index based irrigation scheduling the transferability of the dans index to other regions for irrigation water management is likely to be influenced by climatic and site specific factors for example it is postulated that for similar climatic conditions there will be a gradual increase in the dans index values in heavy clay soils which have a greater water holding capacity compared to a rapid increase of dans values in sandy soils with low water holding capacities in sandier soils crops are more prone to incur water stress faster which will be detected by the dans index and will require frequent but shallow depths of application to avoid loss via percolation on the other hand crops planted on heavy clay soils which can accommodate deeper depth of irrigation water are likely to experience and indicate high dans index values at a later time comparison of the thermal response of crops across soil types in localized and generalized settings is a research line to be investigated considering climate the numerical difference between the stressed and non stressed baseline temperature is greater in arid compared to humid and sub humid regions which also corresponds to a greater evaporative demand in the arid regions compared to humid regions as such a unit increase in canopy temperature above the non stressed baseline temperature in humid regions likely accounts for greater stress level compared to that in arid regions as such it is hypothesized that the dans index threshold for a given crop will be lower in humid compared to arid regions to account for the same degree of stress further infield investigations are required to test this hypothesis it is also important to note that the dans index is only reflective of a point in time water stress intensity level further work to explore cumulative changes in dans index over time and how these related to water stress indictors such as soil moisture are also recommended it was also hypothesized that since the dans index varied across growth stages growth specific baselines and trigger thresholds could further improve the method 4 conclusions this study evaluated the performance of canopy temperature based ctm irrigation scheduling using the degrees above non stressed dans index as compared to commonly applied soil moisture monitoring smm and crop et model etm based irrigation scheduling techniques under semi arid climatic conditions in three growing seasons of 2018 2019 and 2020 this study used a modeled non stressed canopy temperature t cns in the computation of the dans index and the comparison between the modeled and field observed t cns had coefficient of determination r2 values of 0 88 0 81 and 0 84 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively the utilization of a modeled rather than an observed t cns could further ease the application and adoption of thermal indices specifically the dans index in crop water stress monitoring also the dans index matched closely to cwsi a conventionally used thermal indicator of crop water stress with r2 values of 0 64 0 61 and 0 75 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively in 2018 and 2019 the grain yields from the smm and etm methods were statistically similar but different from the ctm method while in 2020 the grain yield of the smm and ctm were statistically comparable but dissimilar from those of the etm treatment across the scheduling treatments more irrigation water was applied during the 2020 dry year and the ctm method had the highest iwp of the scheduling treatments on the other hand the iwp was statistically similar for the scheduling treatments in the normal 2018 year these differences in dry compared to wet and normal years further authenticated that ctm based irrigation scheduling was better suited for deficit irrigation conditions for irrigation scheduling the selected thermal index thresholds played a great role in irrigation efficiency for the ctm method and lowering the dans index trigger threshold from 1 0 to 0 5 c improved the method s performance in 2020 under the experiment conditions the dans index values were observed to vary across crop growth stage in this study and it is therefore suggested that growth stage based irrigation trigger threshold values could be adopted for example growth stage specific thresholds could be set lower in the early season to capture onset of water stress but increase overtime to reflect crop s increased root zone as well as early senescence based on observation of the dans crop growth stage variations in this study threshold value range could be characterized as 0 4 c dans threshold 0 5 c during high water sensitive growth stages tasseling and silking dans threshold 0 5 c post silking to mid reproductive growth stages and 0 5 c dans threshold 1 c in late reproductive stage the testing of growth stage based thresholds and baselines is suggested for future research acknowledgements the authors are grateful to turner dorr jacob nickel von fritsche and

respectively while the year 2018 19 was observed as normal in all the aczs a significant high correlation was observed between the nvswi and vhi and the nvswi and gpp in all three aczs while spi did not exhibit a significant correlation with the nvswi in acz ii and iii the mann kendall test and sen s slope indicated a declining groundwater trend in all the aczs and an increasing trend in nvswi

indices such as standard precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 crop moisture index cmi palmer 1968 crop specific drought index csdi meyer et al 1993 agricultural drought index dtx matera et al 2007 moisture adequacy index mai mcguire and palmer 1957 soil moisture index smi hunt et al 2009 and combined deficit index cdi vyas et al 2015 have been vividly enumerated in literature spi is one of the most widely used drought indices and the world meteorological organization has recommended it for drought monitoring around the world abdulrazzaq et al 2019 spi only requires precipitation data as an input mondol et al 2017 to assess the meteorological drought at different temporal scales the spi also reflects a few aspects of agricultural and hydrological droughts mishra and singh 2011 further drought indices derived from remotely sensed data are more effective than site based drought indices for monitoring the spatio temporal pattern of agricultural droughts drought indices produced from timeseries of remotely sensed data are extremely efficient in monitoring and assessing drought severity due to their high spatio temporal resolution especially in areas with few gauge stations aghakouchak et al 2015 various factors influence the vegetation response including drought duration severity intensity crop phenology and other environmental variables such as type and texture of soils agricultural practices and elevation of the area dubovyk et al 2016 jiao et al 2019 developed a geographically independent integrated drought index giidi by integrating remote sensing data and a local ordered weighted averaging method and it performed reasonably well in most of the north american climatic zones guo et al 2019 proposed an optimal scaled drought condition index osdci based on multiple remote sensing datasets including ndvi and lst from modis precipitation data from the tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm and annual wheat and barley production in central asia their outcome proved the effectiveness of osdci in capturing and monitoring agricultural drought some researchers found the superiority of remote sensing retrieval of solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif in capturing photosynthetic activity of vegetation under drought conditions zhang a et al 2018 xu et al 2021 liu et al 2022 there is still a lack of scientific consensus on its ability to capture long term droughts wang et al 2016 shekhar et al 2020 to assess and monitor the vegetation conditions in time and space various indices based on remotely sensed data have been developed but normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is one of the most widely used indices to effectively monitor and assess the health of vegetation and the occurrence of agricultural drought anyamba et al 2001 cai et al 2010 gopinath et al 2015 sandeep et al 2021 the ndvi and the vegetation health index vhi are broadly recognized for detecting agricultural drought in various regions with varying ecological conditions wang et al 2001 ji and peters 2003 gopinath et al 2015 dutta et al 2015 sandeep et al 2021 agricultural drought is defined as a lack of available soil moisture for vegetation caused by meteorological drought tate and gustard 2000 various studies carried out round the globe found a strong correlation between the remotely sensed vegetation indices and soil moisture content dutta et al 2015 vyas et al 2015 cong et al 2017 ambika and mishra 2019 zuo et al 2019 zou et al 2020 sandeep et al 2021 pogačar et al 2022 the lack of soil moisture caused by meteorological drought is further increased by high surface temperature which intensifies the severity of agricultural drought and impacts the vegetation health combined use of remotely sensed vegetation indices and land surface temperature lst also capture soil moisture along with the vegetation conditions kogan 1995 proposed the vhi by combining the vegetation condition index vci and the temperature condition index tci the inverse relation between ndvi and lst can be applied to predict moisture level in surface soil since the value of tci increases with lst and the vci increases with ndvi thus high lst represents soil moisture deficits and causes stress in the vegetation canopy karnieli et al 2010 as a result the vhi represents the presence of moisture as well as temperature or thermal conditions in the vegetation kogan 2001 vhi basically reflects health of vegetation and is more closely related to soil moisture content than the vci or tci alone yan et al 2016 carlson et al 1994 proposed a new index based on the division of ndvi and lst called the vegetation supply water index vswi however because of its sensitivity to land cover type it directly limits quantification of drought severity nichol and abbas 2015 therefore abbas et al 2014 normalized the vswi values to make it more efficient nvswi that permits realistic and absolute comparisons the capability of the aforementioned drought indices varies greatly in different areas so it is critical to evaluate the performance of a specific drought index prior to using it hence in the present study moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis based ndvi lst and gross primary productivity gpp were considered to understand the spatio temporal dynamics of drought in agriculturally productive region of northwest india for rabi season wheat growing season from december to march from 2001 02 to 2019 20 groundwater resources are now being used more frequently for irrigation purposes as a result of the lack of surface water in arid and semiarid regions choubin and malekian 2017 the northwest indian states of punjab and haryana are known as the food bowl of india for their significant contribution to food security agriculture in this region is mostly dependent on groundwater rosencranz et al 2022 due to scarcity of surface water resources and land based ownership of groundwater groundwater in its major part is under semi critical zone because of its overexploitation for different purposes and less monsoon period rainfall since wheat rice cultivation is dominant in its major part which mainly relies on groundwater thus irrigation become the largest user of groundwater in the area therefore it is necessary to conduct a study that emphasizes on the impact of meteorological and agricultural drought on the groundwater in this food bowl of india most of the previous studies solely focused on drought indices without investigating the relationships between the agricultural drought and depleting groundwater in the area in the present study an attempt has been made to work out the variations of rainfall and groundwater depletion with agricultural produce of wheat in a changing climate leading to an increase in the intensity of droughts reducing groundwater availability and posing a threat to livelihoods and food security the study has three major objectives namely a to identify the meteorological drought event drought duration and intensity using spi and run theory in agroclimatic zones aczs of northwest india b to monitor agricultural droughts during a period of 2001 02 to 2019 20 using different drought indices and c to explore the relationships and investigating monotonic trend analysis of nvswi and groundwater level using mann kendall and sen s slope test 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the states of punjab and haryana collectively cover nearly 94 494 09 km2 of geographical area in northwestern plains of india fig 1 the area comprises a part of western indo gangetic plains and is divided into 4 agroclimatic zones aczs depending upon the climate and soil type of the area as shown in fig 1 acz i represent hot arid climate with desert and saline type soils and occupies nearly 31 1 area acz ii represents semi arid type climate with alluvium derived soils and covers nearly 43 7 area acz iii has hot sub humid type climate with alluvium derived soils and have an area share of nearly 21 5 and acz iv which covers only 3 7 of the area has warm humid himalayan type climate with brown forest and podzolic soil type for the present study zone iv has been excluded as it is mostly occupied by the forest land and has negligible area under agricultural practices topographically majority of the area is almost flat except the northern and southern parts which represent moderately undulating terrain in india these two states collectively produce 34 of total wheat and accounts for 21 of total cultivated land haryana s climate is classified as subtropical semi arid to sub humid continental and monsoon type the average rainfall ranges from 300 mm in the south west hot arid zone acz i to over 1000 mm in the shivalik hills mountainous tracks western himalayan warm sub humid zone acz iv anon 2019 20 in case of punjab the hot arid zone acz i receives average annual rainfall 300 mm which increases to 500 700 mm in semi arid zone acz ii followed by hot sub humid zone acz iii and western himalayan warm sub humid zone acz iv 750 1000 mm anon 2020 21 the states of punjab and haryana receives average annual rainfall of nearly 649 mm and 617 mm respectively and maximum rainfall occur during monsoon period i e from june end to september it also receives a small amount of rainfall in december and january due to western disturbances average winter temperature ranges from 11 to 14 c in the area under investigation spring wheat is the dominant crop grown in the area during winter season sowing november december harvesting end of march to mid april 2 2 datasets used the datasets used for this study are discussed in sequel 2 2 1 rainfall data indian meteorological department imd provides open access to daily rainfall data at 0 25 0 25 degree grid daily gridded data for punjab and haryana was downloaded from https www imdpune govin clim pred lrf new grided data download html for the present study 2 2 2 normalize difference vegetation index ndvi data 16 day ndvi data from the mod13q1 collection v006 product of modis terra was procured for the rabi season growing season of the wheat december to march from the lpdaac https lpdaac usgs gov lpdaac tools cloud and other atmospheric disturbances affect the modis ndvi which has a significant impact on the quality of ndvi to overcome this shortcoming lpdaac also provides the quality control flags along with the data improved ndvi data using quality flags was obtained by using modis viirs python toolbox and arc map software monthly composites of ndvi for growing season of wheat from december to march for a period of 19 years 2001 02 to 2019 20 were prepared in arc map 2 2 3 land surface temperature lst data land surface temperature data of modis terra 8 day product mod11a2 collection v006 was obtained from lpdaac for the growing season of wheat from 2001 02 to 2019 20 monthly composites of lst for growing season of wheat were prepared after the quality check in arc map and were then translated from a digital number dn to degree celsius c by using eq 1 1 lst 0 02 dn 273 15 where 0 02 represents the scale factor and dn represent the digital number of the pixel 2 2 4 other data gross primary productivity gpp data from mod17a2hgf v006 acquired from the lpdaac website and groundwater level data obtained from the online archives of india water portal from 2001 to 2020 were also used to understand the impact of droughts on them the groundwater locations taken into consideration were between 571 and 722 from 2001 to 2020 as some borewells become dysfunctional due to declining groundwater level or for some other reasons and on the other hand some new borewells are drilled from time to time 2 2 5 data quality and integrity data quality flags provided by lpdaac were used for the quality analysis of gpp using modis viirs python toolbox and arc map software to assess the validity of gpp wheat yield predicted from the gpp was compared with actual economic wheat yield obtained from the statistical abstracts of punjab and haryana further both the yields were year wise correlated with each other and the results indicated moderate to strong positive correlation in each acz due to linear positive correlation between gpp derive wheat yield and economic wheat yield gpp was used for the correlation analysis with nvswi also bandyopadhyay et al 2018 studied the accuracy of gridded data from imd 0 25 0 25 with the precipitation data taken from the in situ observatories over india and found its performance satisfactory coefficient of determination r2 values between 0 6 and 0 8 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse value greater than 0 5 in punjab and haryana area 2 3 computation of drought indices 2 3 1 rainfall data time series and computation of spi gridded rainfall data of over 30 years was converted into point data in arc map and monthly time series was prepared from the year 1986 2020 area wise monthly rainfall was averaged for acz i ii and iii to compute the spi r package spei cran repository was used to calculate spi on one 1 there 3 six 6 and twelve 12 month scales for evaluating meteorological drought in this work the index is based on converting aggregated monthly precipitation into a standard normal variable via an equi probability transformation in fact calculating the index entails fitting a probability distribution to aggregated monthly precipitation series e g k 3 6 12 24 months determining the non exceedance probability and identifying the appropriate standard normal quantile as the spi the gamma distribution was found to fit long term rainfall records well in agreement with earlier research mckee et al 1993 livada and assimakopoulos 2007 stagge et al 2015 it is defined as follow eq 2 in terms of a frequency or probability density function 2 γ x 1 β α γ α x α 1 e z β forx 0 in this γ α represents the gamma distribution function x represents the rainfall α is the shape parameter and β is scale parameter for a multiyear data the maximum probability α and β varies as per eq 3 3 α 1 4 a 1 1 4 a 3 β x α wherea ln x ln x n where x is the mean rainfall and n represents the number of measurements as the gamma function remains undefined for x 0 and temporal rainfall data might include 0 rainfall the cumulative probability becomes 4 h x q 1 q g x the probability of 0 rainfall q in temporal dataset is computed by q m n where m denotes the occurrence of 0 rainfall in the temporal rainfall data further h x can be converted into a z score value with a mean of 0 and a unit variance that represents the value gao et al 2018 pandey et al 2021 the spi value 2 0 was considered as extreme drought 2 0 to 1 5 as severe drought 1 5 to 1 0 as moderate drought and 1 0 to 1 0 as normal year 2 4 identification of drought events and their characterization a run is a set of observations of the same type that are preceded and succeeded by one or more unlike observations yevjevich 1967 proposed the run theory for identifying drought parameters and analyzing their statistical features in terms of run length drought duration run sum drought severity and intensity the choice of critical threshold level of the parameter is central to the run theory guerrero salazar and yevjievich 1975 which could be constant and or changes with time the threshold level in the present investigation was set at 1 0 pandey et al 2021 with the royal blue and red color areas fig 2 representing positive and negative mean monthly spi values respectively when the spi remains consistently 0 or negative and achieves a factor reading of 1 0 or less for at least two consecutive months it is considered a drought event a drought event begins when the spi meets the above mentioned criteria and cease when it rises above zero spi 0 stagge et al 2015 pandey et al 2021 the run theory was used to quantify the three key features namely duration severity and intensity of drought occurrences drought duration dd is the time between the start and end of a drought episode in months drought severity ds is defined as the sum of all drought index values over the course of a drought event and drought intensity di is defined as the ratio of severity to drought duration tan et al 2015 nam et al 2015 for the present investigation 12 month spi was considered for the identification of drought events and further seasonal spi from december to march 2001 02 to 2019 20 was correlated with the nvswi derived from ndvi and lst 2 4 1 vegetation health index vhi ndvi provides a good indication of the chlorophyll content and vegetation cover and lst provides a proxy to assess the evapotranspiration from the canopy and soil moisture content karnieli et al 2010 the ndvi derived vegetation condition index vci and lst derived temperature condition index tci has been extensively used to detect the start of a drought as well as its intensity duration and impact the vci and tci for the growing season of wheat december march from 2001 02 to 2019 20 were computed using ndvi and lst data respectively the vci and tci were computed using eqs 5 and 6 respectively reflect the relative greenness and temperature of the plants kogan 1995 1997 5 vci ndvi j ndvi k min ndvi k max ndvi k min 100 6 tci tci k max tci j tci k max tci k min 100 where j represents the month and k represents the year vci and tci as ndvi and lst normalizations emphasize relative variations in local ndvi and lst over time vhi which indicates the health of the vegetation is an additional combination of the vci and tci with the same weight assuming an even contribution from two parameters eq 7 7 vhi α vci 1 α tci since vci and tci reflect distinct features of the vegetation response to drought and are independent of one another a weighted summation rather than a simple addition provides the optimum fusion performance sun and kafatos 2007 hence α in eq 7 represents the weights that is a constant value 0 5 for this study 2 4 2 computation of vegetation supply water index vswi and normalized vegetation supply water index nvswi another most extensively used agricultural drought indicator is the vswi carlson et al 1990 vswi reflects the linkages between changes in the temperature of the canopy and soil water supply chen et al 2018 sandeep et al 2021 vegetation having adequate soil water supply has a relatively lower lst while lst will be high over the vegetated areas with inadequate soil water supply tan et al 2004 during a drought event content of available soil water is likely to be smaller due to the high temperature resulting in an intensified evapotranspiration rate vswi was computed using eq 8 from 2001 02 to 2019 20 december march 8 vswi ndvi lst the larger values of vswi indicates elevated vegetation transpiration and higher soil water content and vice versa this ndvi lst ratio is useful for determining the type of agricultural drought that endures in a given area due to variations in plant cover and soil moisture stress rabi season ndvi and lst generated from modis v 006 product for 19 years was used to compute vswi which was then normalized to develop normalized vegetation supply water index nvswi abbas et al 2014 using following eq 9 9 nvswi vswi vswi min vswi max vswi min 100 where vswi is vegetation supply water index for the wheat growing period vswi min and vswi max are minimum and maximum value of vswi of the pixel during the period of study respectively the value of nvswi ranges between 0 and 100 zero indicating severe drought and 100 representing wettest conditions severe drought values below 20 moderate drought 20 40 minor drought 40 60 normal 60 80 and wet values over 80 were used to classify the index values 2 5 correlation analysis of seasonal nvswi with vhi spi gpp and groundwater level drought occurrence and severity are influenced by rainfall which is one of the most important climatic elements since rainfall variability and abnormality have a strong influence on drought severity seasonal spi 12 december to march was utilized as an independent variable to examine its correlation with the seasonal nvswi during the dry and normal years gross primary productivity gpp reflects the organic productivity of the ecosystem beer et al 2010 delucia et al 2019 droughts one of the most severe climate extremes endanger global carbon balance reichstein et al 2013 zhao and running 2010 and food security song et al 2018 as they limit the vegetative carbon uptake since it is important to understand the impact of drought on the gpp of the ecosystem therefore relationships between nvswi and gpp were also worked out zonal statistics using administrative area i e number of taluks in each acz over the agricultural pixels was used to get the mean spi nvswi and gpp for their correlation analysis moreover agricultural production in this area is dependent on the irrigation practices and these states are among the largest users of groundwater to increase the crop yield and to achieve the food security higher production during rain deficit times heavily relies on the groundwater resources thus relationships between nvswi and groundwater level and their trend analysis were also carried out 2 6 trend analysis of nvswi and groundwater level using mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator the non parametric mann kendall test kendall 1975 mann 1945 is widely used in detecting the trends in environmental variables yue et al 2002 tabari and marofi 2011 gocic and trajkovic 2013 due to its insensitivity to the normal distribution of data and outliers the mann kendall test in r software cran repository was used to perform trend analysis for nvswi december march from 2001 02 to 2019 20 and groundwater level january april from 2002 to 2020 besides a simple non parametric approach i e statistics of slope proposed by sen 1968 was also used to assess the magnitude of trend in the sample of n pairs of data details about the mann kendall test kendall 1975 mann 1945 wang et al 2013 ribeiro et al 2015 baig et al 2022 and sen s slope estimator are already well established in literature gocic and trajkovic 2013 he and gautam 2016 the study area was divided into 3 zones each for punjab and haryana as groundwater use for irrigation in punjab and haryana is differently controlled and the mean nvswi and mean groundwater level were used for the trend analysis in the aczs of each state 3 results and discussions 3 1 rainfall characteristics in the study area the maximum annual rainfall in acz i acz ii and acz iii was recorded in the years 2004 05 2019 20 and 2006 07 respectively the long term 1986 2020 average annual rainfall december march in the area under investigation was 40 7 mm 67 01 mm and 130 4 mm in acz i acz ii and acz iii respectively also the difference in the mean values of rainfall between acz i and ii acz ii and iii and acz i and iii was 26 4 mm 63 3 mm and 89 8 mm respectively 3 2 drought events frequency and intensity run theory was used to identify and analyze the drought duration dd drought severity ds and drought intensity di based on spi 12 in all 3 aczs of the study area the longest duration of drought witnessed by the acz i was 45 months during the drought event 4 1999 2003 fig 2 a followed by drought event 1 with a 13 month duration drought event 4 was more severe than drought event 1 but the di of drought event 1 was higher fig 2 b acz ii experienced the longest and most severe drought 46 months during the drought event 3 1999 2003 followed by 1987 88 12 days fig 2 c but the di of event 1 was higher than that of event 3 fig 2 d acz iii endured the maximum number of drought events 6 the longest and most severe was during 2004 2007 followed by 2001 2003 and 2016 2018 fig 2 e although this zone suffered the maximum number of drought events the di was 1 0 for most of the events except the drought events 1 1987 88 and 6 2016 18 which indicated the di 1 0 fig 2 f as a result increased drought occurrences in acz i and ii might have an influence on crop yields due to decreased rainfall and climate variability 3 2 1 spatio temporal dynamics of spi 12 specifically the shorter time scales of spi values 1 3 and 6 adequately depicts early warning of meteorological drought as well as interim soil moisture and agricultural deficits svoboda et al 2012 the identification of dry normal and wet episodes becomes much more apparent in spi 12 due to its cumulative duration which shows a long term drought trend hydrological drought therefore for the present study spi 12 were considered drought events were considered when the spi 12 value was 1 0 for two consecutive months till the value became positive a perusal of fig 2 indicate that 5 major drought events 1986 88 1989 90 1992 1999 2001 2002 03 in acz i 4 in acz ii 1987 88 1992 1993 1999 2003 and 6 in 1987 88 2002 03 2004 07 2009 10 2014 15 and 2016 18 acz iii were identified in the present study spatial distribution maps of spi for the growing season of wheat december march from 2001 02 to 2019 20 is shown in fig 3 it is evident from the fig 3 that spi varied spatially and each zone endured drought events at different times the driest spell of spi 2 0 to the wettest spell spi 2 0 varied significantly in all the aczs however the year 2008 09 was the wet year for all the aczs but the spatial extent of wetness was larger in the acz i and acz ii in acz iii 2011 12 was the wettest year with maximum precipitation in the northern part of the study area as far as the drought events are concerned all the zones experienced the rabi season drought on temporally different scales the driest year for acz i acz ii and acz iii were 2002 03 2014 15 and 2016 17 respectively and therefore being the driest years these were selected for the further analysis to determine the impact of drought events on vhi nvswi and gpp 3 3 dynamics of ndvi lst vci tci vhi and gpp from 2001 02 to 2019 20 ndvi could be utilized as a robust parameter for monitoring soil surface moisture allowing drought occurrences to be easily identified the mean ndvi value in the acz i was lowest in 2002 03 while the highest mean ndvi and good vegetation cover were recorded in 2018 19 the lowest seasonal mean ndvi was observed in acz ii and acz iii in 2001 02 whereas good vegetation growth was observed in the years 2018 2020 the acz i had the lowest ndvi 0 20 values every year whereas the acz ii was found to be the greenest of the three aczs for the chosen time period from 2013 14 onwards good vegetation growth ndvi 0 60 was observed in the acz i and from 2017 2020 the entire study area had a healthy vegetation cover vci fig 4 also indicated the highest values of vci during this period the increase in good vegetation cover from 2017 onwards could be attributed to near normal rainfall during these years as seen in fig 3 where spi values for the whole research area were almost normal throughout these years the growing season ndvi analysis reveals that the acz i had poor vegetation cover for the majority of the years whereas acz ii has reasonably good vegetation cover however due to high temperatures and unpredictable rainfall agricultural lands have been under severe stress due to climatic variables the croplands of acz i and acz iii are experiencing severe vegetal degradation and have had a negative impact on crop vegetative growth the vci derived from the ndvi is shown in fig 4 which also demonstrated that acz i and iii often have the lowest vci values the maximum seasonal lst of 32 88 c was recorded in the years 2005 06 in the southwestern part haryana of the study area and temperatures in this part remained high during the entire period of investigation the minimum seasonal lst i e 16 55 c and 16 56 c was observed in the years 2018 19 and 2019 20 mainly in the northern part punjab the spatial extent of lst 20 c was prevalent in the major part of the study area during 2011 12 and 2018 19 while lst 26 c prevailed over the study area during the years from 2001 02 to 2005 06 2008 09 2009 10 and 2015 16 in general the lst in the northwestern part of the study area remained low while lst was usually high in the southwestern part the lowest value of tci depicts the driest soil moisture conditions while high values of tci reflect the wet conditions the lowest tci i e 40 0 was mainly prevalent in acz i in most of the years acz ii had the lowest tci 31 in its major part in 2014 15 while acz iii and some parts of acz ii had low tci 32 in 2016 17 fig 5 the spatial distribution maps of vegetation health index vhi derived from the weighted linear combination of vci and tci given in fig 6 despite the fact that the majority of the study area did not exhibit a drought vhi 40 condition during the period of this study acz i consistently exhibited low vhi values the linear relationship between vci and tci the omission of a normalizing component for the computation of vhi from vci and tci and classification thresholds may explain why vhi did not reflect drought conditions in acz ii and acz iii fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of mean gpp over the selected agro climatic zones of punjab and haryana for wheat growing season gpp was significantly higher in acz ii from 2001 02 to 2007 08 while its lowest values were observed in acz i for the same time period from 2013 14 onwards acz i hot arid zone of punjab and haryana had experienced increased seasonal gpp which might be due to the near normal rainfall conditions in the acz i since gpp is sensitive to dry and wet conditions wang et al 2018 high gpp values in acz ii and acz iii could be due to their heavy reliance on groundwater for irrigation practices and climate type table 1 3 4 agricultural drought assessment from nvswi spatio temporal analysis of nvswi indicated that the acz i suffered recurring moderate to light drought occurrences during the period of study fig 8 however the worst drought events occurred in the years 2001 02 2002 03 2003 04 and 2005 06 and the ndvi values were also relatively low during these events from table 2 it is also clear that more than 75 of the agricultural area in the acz i remained in the slight to severe drought category and from 2010 onwards the area under this category showed progressive decrease in acz ii 80 agricultural area was under slight to severe drought in the years 2001 02 2002 03 2003 04 2005 06 and 2009 10 while during 2018 19 and 2019 20 it decreased significantly in 2015 16 severe to slight droughts were recorded in parts of haryana state but when moving towards punjab the area under slight drought was reduced it is also noticeable that during these drought events the area under severe to slight drought in acz ii of haryana was greater when compared to punjab the area under severe to slight drought in acz iii was more than 80 in 2001 02 2002 03 2003 04 2005 06 2009 10 and 2015 16 but it has been reduced to nearly 20 in 2018 19 and also majority of the area remained drought free during 2018 20 although all the aczs experienced the agricultural drought at different time periods during the year 2009 10 majority of the study area 75 of the area of acz i 85 of acz ii and 84 of iii remained under a slight drought indicating the maximum spatial extent of the agricultural area during the year 2018 19 and 2019 20 all the aczs remained almost drought free except a few scattered pockets and spi during this time period also reflected normal conditions however as per spi the wettest years were 2008 09 and 2011 12 but the optimum soil moisture content timing and frequency of irrigation and rainfall temperature co2 concentration tropospheric ozone o3 concentration pests and fertilizer use also plays a major role for plant growth daloz et al 2021 time of early drought and low soil moisture content affects the germination formation of seedling and early vigor while terminal droughts influence the ear formation and grain filling of wheat which might be overcome by artificial irrigation latiri et al 2010 hence the study shows that nvswi may be used to map monitor and assess agricultural dryness especially in arid and semi arid regions 3 5 correlation analysis between nvswi vhi spi and gpp nvswi vhi spi and gpp over the agricultural pixels in the aczs were correlated with each other to determine the relationships and robustness of nvswi to detect the drought fig 9 during dry years 2002 03 in acz i 2014 15 in acz ii 2016 17 in acz iii the results showed positive linear relationship between drought severity and vegetation health the correlation coefficient between nvswi and vhi r 0 92 for acz i fig 9 a r 0 753 for acz ii fig 9 d r 0 935 for acz iii fig 9 g indicated positive linear relationship between drought severity and vegetation health the very high positive correlation between nvswi and vhi reflects the ability of nvswi to capture soil moisture conditions and vegetation conditions sandeep et al 2021 the moderate positive correlation coefficients r 0 545 between nvswi and spi in acz i indicated the importance of rainfall for crop growth in hot arid areas fig 9 b in 2002 03 a major part of the acz i was under severe to slight drought and spi values were also low during that year so it was also subjected to corresponding lowering of gross primary productivity gpp also indicated a very strong positive correlation with the nvswi figs 9 and 10 c f i thus showing the effectiveness of the nvswi to capture the organic carbon productivity of wheat although spi 12 indicated a dry season during the year 2014 15 in acz ii and nearly 38 of its area was under severe to slight drought conditions the spatial extent of the drought was much lower than the drought extent of 2009 10 the high drought extent shown by nvswi in the year 2009 10 fig 8 might be due to the lower rainfall in different parts of all the aczs fig 3 irrigation has a significant impact on raising soil moisture which enhances the green vegetation fraction and gross primary output wu et al 2018 the moderate positive correlation between spi and nvswi in acz i and acz ii and the insignificant correlation in acz iii during dry fig 9 b e h and normal year fig 10 b e h might be due to the prevalence of groundwater based irrigation practices in the area when considering the correlation between nvswi and spi in acz iii the correlation was insignificant during dry fig 9 h as well as normal year fig 10 h during the normal rainfall year i e 2018 19 the whole study area was free from drought and an increase in nvswi vhi and gpp values was also observed a significant positive correlation was again observed between nvswi and vhi during the normal year 2018 19 in all the aczs fig 10 a d g low nvswi values indicate drought conditions and under drought conditions the plants do not get sufficient water for their metabolic activities which hinders their normal photosynthetic activities and their stored organic carbon also gets reduced the strong positive correlation between nvswi and gpp acz i r 0 954 acz ii r 0 811 and acz iii r 0 81 in dry fig 9 c f i and normal conditions acz i r 0 885 acz ii r 0 849 and acz iii moderate positive correlation coefficient r 0 685 fig 10 c f i in all aczs demonstrated the effectiveness of nvswi in identifying drought conditions and subsequent changes in the organic carbon storage of the biomass 3 6 groundwater level and nvswi spatio temporal variations in groundwater level during the pre and post monsoon season are shown in figs 11 and 12 respectively the figures show that groundwater level remained 15 0 m below ground level m bgl in major part of acz i ii and iii from 2001 to 2007 since 2007 there has been a noticeable decline in groundwater levels and the maximum decline was observed in the central part of the study area i e acz ii the deepest groundwater level 35 0 m bgl was found in the southern part of haryana acz i from the year 2002 onwards and the area falling into this category has grown since then the central part of acz ii experienced the greatest groundwater decline from 2001 and 2020 groundwater levels in the majority of its acz ii area declined from 15 0 m bgl in 2001 to 35 0 40 0 m bgl in 2019 20 in some places the groundwater became deeper than 40 0 m bgl central part of acz iii also witnessed the groundwater level situation similar to acz ii according to rodell et al 2009 and asoka et al 2018 groundwater level decline in western indo gangetic plains was primarily caused by pumping and long term declines in monsoonal precipitation therefore low groundwater recharging and increased groundwater withdrawal for irrigation purposes resulted in groundwater decline in major parts of acz ii and iii of punjab and haryana further moderate positive and insignificant correlation between spi and nvswi instigated a need to further investigate the role of surface and ground water in wheat production in the study area the aczs were state wise divided to know the relationships between mean groundwater level april and mean nvswi values from the 2001 02 to 2019 20 fig 13 in 2002 the mean groundwater level in acz i of punjab was 5 m bgl which reached at 10 m bgl in 2020 fig 13 b while in haryana it was 12 4 m bgl in the year 2002 and it touched 17 m bgl during 2020 fig 13 d although this zone is suffering from the problem of water logging and salinity and most of its area is under canal irrigation in both the states but intensive agricultural practices have proliferated the use of deeper groundwater to irrigate the fields the groundwater level and nvswi had a correlation coefficient of 0 864 and 0 68 in acz i of punjab and haryana respectively fig 13 depicts that mean nvswi showed an increasing trend while the mean groundwater level had a declining trend in case of acz ii of punjab the mean groundwater level was 11 m bgl in the year 2002 and declined to 25 m bgl in the year 2020 fig 13 b while in case of haryana it was 9 m bgl and reached 17 m bgl in the year 2020 fig 13 d the mean nvswi and the mean groundwater level in punjab and haryana exhibited a moderate and strong negative trend of 0 422 and 0 72 respectively indicating a significant use of groundwater irrigation and monsoon vagaries the acz ii in both the states heavily rely on the groundwater for agricultural production the groundwater level in this zone is declining at an alarming rate and some areas are also facing the problems of water shortage and deeper water table moreover acz ii also remained green in most of the years during the period of study which is clear reflection of groundwater use for irrigational practices the nvswi in acz ii of punjab remained higher than the other two zones till 2012 2013 and it was mostly at the cost of groundwater the mean groundwater level in punjab s acz iii was 10 m bgl in 2002 and declined to 17 m bgl in 2020 fig 13 b whereas nvswi values showed a mixed trend in the acz ii of punjab fig 13 a and increasing trend in haryana fig 13 c it also indicated a moderate negative correlation of 0 49 and 0 39 between nvswi and groundwater level in punjab and haryana respectively the mann kendall trend analysis along with sen s slope is given in table 3 the trends at 95 and 99 confidence level α 0 05 and α 0 01 show that there is a significant trend for nvswi and groundwater level in punjab and haryana except for acz ii in punjab and acz iii in haryana the highest increase in nvswi were observed in acz i 1 23 acz iii 1 13 of haryana and acz i 1 05 of punjab as per the sen s slope estimator q med acz iii of punjab exhibited a 0 64 year increase while the acz ii of haryana reflected an increase of 0 67 year in nvswi however the nvswi values in the acz ii of punjab have not shown any significant increasing trend but a significant decreasing trend of 0 76 year was observed in groundwater level in this zone it reflects that agriculture in this zone was mostly based on irrigation from groundwater and nvswi values almost remained high from 2002 to 2020 but kept on oscillating fig 13 a hence the trend was not significant according to sen s slope q med acz ii of haryana also presented a highly significant negative trend of 0 41 year along with a highly significant increasing trend of 0 67 in nvswi values the lowest highly significant declining trends of 0 26 year and 0 27 year in groundwater level were recorded in the acz i of punjab and haryana where irrigation is mostly restricted to surface water due to inland aquifer salinity and water logging conditions thus reflecting the sporadic nature of groundwater based irrigation 4 discussions from the above observations it can be inferred that meteorological drought varied spatio temporally in all the aczs the results of spi indicated that acz iii hot sub humid witnessed the maximum 6 number of drought events while the least 4 drought events were experienced by acz i hot arid at different time periods but drought events from 2001 to 2003 were experienced by all the aczs from spi 12 values it could be concluded that acz iii i e the hot sub humid zone witnessed more drought events than acz i and acz ii spi 12 also covered the drought events of 1987 and 2002 03 which are well documented in the earlier studies saini et al 2020 rainfall as well as the soil water storage reflected a negative anomaly during 1987 88 2002 03 2004 07 drought events over punjab and haryana mukherjee et al 2019 and the tci in our present investigation indicates low soil moisture conditions in acz i from 2001 02 to 2010 11 crop yield is eventually impacted by severe drought conditions during the growing season rhee et al 2010 and hence the crop yield decreased mukherjee et al 2019 drought duration dd drought severity ds and drought intensity di also varied across the acz the spatial distribution maps of spi and nvswi also implied that areas that reflected the meteorological droughts during dry years in different aczs also showed the agricultural droughts however in the acz iii hot sub humid zone discrepancies were observed different drought indices appear to measure the severity of the drought differently kundu et al 2020 hashemzadeh ghalhari et al 2022 as per vhi majority of the area in acz ii and iii was free from drought but nvswi and spi captured the drought episodes efficiently in these zones punjab and haryana witnessed a prolonged period of analogously low wheat yield from the year 2002 03 to 2010 11 mukherjee et al 2010 the distribution maps of nvswi fig 8 and gpp fig 7 also indicated their lower values from 2001 to 2011 in acz i and acz iii the gpp of vegetation is controlled by water availability wang et al 2018a zhang et al 2018b walther et al 2019 thus its high correlation with nvswi also supports the effectiveness of nvswi in capturing the drought events high correlation between nvswi and vhi and gpp indicated that increased low soil moisture content also impact the vegetation dynamics and organic carbon in crop biomass since low correlation between nvswi and spi reflected less impact of meteorological drought on irrigated areas the outcome of nvswi and spi correlation in the present investigation are consistent with the study conducted by ambika and mishra 2019 which also demonstrated the high correlation r between nvswi and spi in non irrigated and lower correlation r in irrigated agricultural regions of the indo gangetic plains groundwater based irrigation dominates the western parts of the indo gangetic plain i e haryana and punjab which has been the main cause for the declining groundwater levels in punjab and haryana rodell et al 2009 mishra et al 2016 asoka et al 2017 kaur and rishi 2018 mishra et al 2018 kaur et al 2020 irrigation in acz ii and iii is mainly dependent on groundwater and high agricultural production resulted in decline in groundwater level thus with increased frequency of droughts and rapidly declining groundwater levels in punjab and haryana crop production may decrease and food security may be jeopardized 5 conclusion as per the results of spi acz iii witnessed maximum drought episodes as compared to acz i and ii the driest years were 2002 03 acz i 2014 15 acz ii and 2016 17 acz iii respectively the spatio temporal maps of nvswi were suggestive that ndvi and lst can have the potential to detect vegetation health and soil moisture which can be used for agricultural drought monitoring the nvswi indicated that during the 2002 03 drought event a major part of all the aczs experienced severe to slight agricultural drought according to the spatial distribution map of spi drought was observed in the southeastern part of acz ii and the area that had the lowest rainfall also indicated the lowest nvswi in acz iii the spatial distribution map of spi 12 indicated meteorological drought and nvswi also exhibited severe to slight agricultural drought in this zone the spi map also showed that the year 2018 19 was a normal year in terms of meteorological drought and the same was supported by nvswi correlation between nvswi and vhi indicated that ndvi and lst ratios can be used effectively in monitoring droughts in arid and semi arid regions the high correlation between nvswi and gpp provides an identification of drought conditions and subsequent changes in biomass organic carbon storage a poor correlation between nvswi and spi portrayed less influence of meteorological drought on vegetation dynamics due to groundwater based irrigation practices in acz ii and acz iii further trend analysis of nvswi and groundwater level indicated an increasing and decreasing mean trend respectively in all the acz the mann kendall and sen slope tests revealed that the groundwater is being used extensively for irrigation in acz ii semi arid where maximum groundwater decline 0 75 m year in punjab and 0 40 m year in haryana was observed hence it can be inferred that the occurrence of meteorological and agricultural droughts in the agroclimatic zones of punjab and haryana varies spatio temporally modis based nvswi vhi ndvi and lst are efficient remote sensing indices to monitor agricultural droughts and their high temporal resolution might prove helpful in ensuring food security and groundwater level management moreover groundwater level in this area is depleting at a fast pace due to extensive irrigation practices in the semi arid zone hence efficient management practices and strict policy measures need to be implemented on the ground funding not applicable data availability statement data availability statement rainfall and

9251,wheat is an important component of global food security and punjab and haryana are the major wheat growing areas in northwest india but climate change has increased the frequency of droughts in this region timely precise and effective drought monitoring is critical to ensure food security in the present study meteorological and agricultural droughts were assessed using standard precipitation index spi and remote sensing based indices namely vegetation health index vhi and normalized vegetation supply water index nvswi during the rabi season wheat growing season in three different agroclimatic zones aczs i e acz i hot arid agro climatic zone acz ii semi arid agro climatic zone and acz iii hot sub humid agro climatic zone of punjab and haryana furthermore correlations between nvswi vhi spi and gross primary productivity gpp were investigated as well as trend analysis of nvswi and groundwater level to better understand their interrelationships and the impact of agricultural droughts on groundwater level the results of spi indicated that acz iii witnessed more drought episodes than acz i and ii the driest years in acz i acz ii and acz iii were 2002 03 2014 15 and 2016 17 respectively while the year 2018 19 was observed as normal in all the aczs a significant high correlation was observed between the nvswi and vhi and the nvswi and gpp in all three aczs while spi did not exhibit a significant correlation with the nvswi in acz ii and iii the mann kendall test and sen s slope indicated a declining groundwater trend in all the aczs and an increasing trend in nvswi values the results underline the robustness of spi and nvswi in drought monitoring in semi arid and arid zones of northwest india rainfall variability and increased groundwater use for irrigation practices in semi arid and hot sub humid areas are leading to groundwater decline graphical abstract ga1 keywords agroclimatic zones meteorological drought agricultural drought standard precipitation

irreversible or irreparable damage to our environment and socio economic system kazemzadeh and malekian 2016 ozelkan et al 2016 mainly in arid and semi arid regions food security has become a crucial issue for many developing countries in the face of an ever increasing global population furthermore changing climate increases the intensity and frequency of extreme events such as droughts reducing water availability and posing a threat to livelihoods and global food production qu et al 2019 drought is a stochastic process that begins with below average rainfall and affects streamflow soil moisture groundwater and other water storage and has become more perilous and pervasive due to the climate change dai et al 2004 mohseni saravi et al 2009 borji et al 2016 droughts can occur for a variety of reasons but the most prominent are those with high and intense water shortages caused by insufficient rainfall overexploitation of water resources high evapotranspiration rate or a combination of these factors a rainfall deficit from the normal causes meteorological drought whereas soil moisture deficit induces agricultural drought that results in declined crop yield reduced streamflow in a catchment due to low rainfall refers to hydrological drought the meteorological hydrological and agricultural drought altogether cause shortage of raw material and economic goods in the market food insecurity and loss of livelihoods culminating to the socio economic drought du et al 2013 although it is difficult to predict the economic consequences of drought it impacts an economy in a multifaceted manner india is one of the world s most vulnerable and drought prone countries droughts affect up to 68 of india s agricultural land with 33 categorized as chronically drought prone which includes desert and semiarid regions with annual rainfall of less than 750 mm khambete 2018 since the last five decades at least one drought has been documented every three years in india samra 2004 india is one of the ten countries facing substantial socio economic risk as a result of increased drought in the changing climate scenario liu and chen 2021 geographical areas with recurring drought episodes are at high risk of future droughts showing the increased spatial extent induced by climate change kundzewicz et al 2008 alamgir et al 2020 the states of punjab and haryana in northwestern india receives nearly 73 rainfall from the south west monsoon from july to september every year these states also receive rainfall during winters december to february from the western disturbances average annual rainfall in punjab and haryana ranges from more than 1000 mm in the north eastern parts to less than 300 mm in the south western parts in this agriculturally productive northwestern part of india drought affects one or more regions almost every year due to the unequal and irregular distribution of rainfall since meteorological droughts are area specific as the rainfall deficits vary from area to area kingra and misra 2021 but this leads to agricultural and hydrological droughts abdulrazzaq et al 2019 drought in agriculture impacts plants and crops by decreasing vegetative productivity which can lead to widespread crop failure drought analysis has been quantified using a variety of approaches and indices however rainfall soil moisture vegetation status potential evapotranspiration groundwater level and availability of surface water are among the most important drought causative and responsive factors mishra and singh 2011 a number of drought indices such as standard precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 crop moisture index cmi palmer 1968 crop specific drought index csdi meyer et al 1993 agricultural drought index dtx matera et al 2007 moisture adequacy index mai mcguire and palmer 1957 soil moisture index smi hunt et al 2009 and combined deficit index cdi vyas et al 2015 have been vividly enumerated in literature spi is one of the most widely used drought indices and the world meteorological organization has recommended it for drought monitoring around the world abdulrazzaq et al 2019 spi only requires precipitation data as an input mondol et al 2017 to assess the meteorological drought at different temporal scales the spi also reflects a few aspects of agricultural and hydrological droughts mishra and singh 2011 further drought indices derived from remotely sensed data are more effective than site based drought indices for monitoring the spatio temporal pattern of agricultural droughts drought indices produced from timeseries of remotely sensed data are extremely efficient in monitoring and assessing drought severity due to their high spatio temporal resolution especially in areas with few gauge stations aghakouchak et al 2015 various factors influence the vegetation response including drought duration severity intensity crop phenology and other environmental variables such as type and texture of soils agricultural practices and elevation of the area dubovyk et al 2016 jiao et al 2019 developed a geographically independent integrated drought index giidi by integrating remote sensing data and a local ordered weighted averaging method and it performed reasonably well in most of the north american climatic zones guo et al 2019 proposed an optimal scaled drought condition index osdci based on multiple remote sensing datasets including ndvi and lst from modis precipitation data from the tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm and annual wheat and barley production in central asia their outcome proved the effectiveness of osdci in capturing and monitoring agricultural drought some researchers found the superiority of remote sensing retrieval of solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif in capturing photosynthetic activity of vegetation under drought conditions zhang a et al 2018 xu et al 2021 liu et al 2022 there is still a lack of scientific consensus on its ability to capture long term droughts wang et al 2016 shekhar et al 2020 to assess and monitor the vegetation conditions in time and space various indices based on remotely sensed data have been developed but normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is one of the most widely used indices to effectively monitor and assess the health of vegetation and the occurrence of agricultural drought anyamba et al 2001 cai et al 2010 gopinath et al 2015 sandeep et al 2021 the ndvi and the vegetation health index vhi are broadly recognized for detecting agricultural drought in various regions with varying ecological conditions wang et al 2001 ji and peters 2003 gopinath et al 2015 dutta et al 2015 sandeep et al 2021 agricultural drought is defined as a lack of available soil moisture for vegetation caused by meteorological drought tate and gustard 2000 various studies carried out round the globe found a strong correlation between the remotely sensed vegetation indices and soil moisture content dutta et al 2015 vyas et al 2015 cong et al 2017 ambika and mishra 2019 zuo et al 2019 zou et al 2020 sandeep et al 2021 pogačar et al 2022 the lack of soil moisture caused by meteorological drought is further increased by high surface temperature which intensifies the severity of agricultural drought and impacts the vegetation health combined use of remotely sensed vegetation indices and land surface temperature lst also capture soil moisture along with the vegetation conditions kogan 1995 proposed the vhi by combining the vegetation condition index vci and the temperature condition index tci the inverse relation between ndvi and lst can be applied to predict moisture level in surface soil since the value of tci increases with lst and the vci increases with ndvi thus high lst represents soil moisture deficits and causes stress in the vegetation canopy karnieli et al 2010 as a result the vhi represents the presence of moisture as well as temperature or thermal conditions in the vegetation kogan 2001 vhi basically reflects health of vegetation and is more closely related to soil moisture content than the vci or tci alone yan et al 2016 carlson et al 1994 proposed a new index based on the division of ndvi and lst called the vegetation supply water index vswi however because of its sensitivity to land cover type it directly limits quantification of drought severity nichol and abbas 2015 therefore abbas et al 2014 normalized the vswi values to make it more efficient nvswi that permits realistic and absolute comparisons the capability of the aforementioned drought indices varies greatly in different areas so it is critical to evaluate the performance of a specific drought index prior to using it hence in the present study moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis based ndvi lst and gross primary productivity gpp were considered to understand the spatio temporal dynamics of drought in agriculturally productive region of northwest india for rabi season wheat growing season from december to march from 2001 02 to 2019 20 groundwater resources are now being used more frequently for irrigation purposes as a result of the lack of surface water in arid and semiarid regions choubin and malekian 2017 the northwest indian states of punjab and haryana are known as the food bowl of india for their significant contribution to food security agriculture in this region is mostly dependent on groundwater rosencranz et al 2022 due to scarcity of surface water resources and land based ownership of groundwater groundwater in its major part is under semi critical zone because of its overexploitation for different purposes and less monsoon period rainfall since wheat rice cultivation is dominant in its major part which mainly relies on groundwater thus irrigation become the largest user of groundwater in the area therefore it is necessary to conduct a study that emphasizes on the impact of meteorological and agricultural drought on the groundwater in this food bowl of india most of the previous studies solely focused on drought indices without investigating the relationships between the agricultural drought and depleting groundwater in the area in the present study an attempt has been made to work out the variations of rainfall and groundwater depletion with agricultural produce of wheat in a changing climate leading to an increase in the intensity of droughts reducing groundwater availability and posing a threat to livelihoods and food security the study has three major objectives namely a to identify the meteorological drought event drought duration and intensity using spi and run theory in agroclimatic zones aczs of northwest india b to monitor agricultural droughts during a period of 2001 02 to 2019 20 using different drought indices and c to explore the relationships and investigating monotonic trend analysis of nvswi and groundwater level using mann kendall and sen s slope test 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the states of punjab and haryana collectively cover nearly 94 494 09 km2 of geographical area in northwestern plains of india fig 1 the area comprises a part of western indo gangetic plains and is divided into 4 agroclimatic zones aczs depending upon the climate and soil type of the area as shown in fig 1 acz i represent hot arid climate with desert and saline type soils and occupies nearly 31 1 area acz ii represents semi arid type climate with alluvium derived soils and covers nearly 43 7 area acz iii has hot sub humid type climate with alluvium derived soils and have an area share of nearly 21 5 and acz iv which covers only 3 7 of the area has warm humid himalayan type climate with brown forest and podzolic soil type for the present study zone iv has been excluded as it is mostly occupied by the forest land and has negligible area under agricultural practices topographically majority of the area is almost flat except the northern and southern parts which represent moderately undulating terrain in india these two states collectively produce 34 of total wheat and accounts for 21 of total cultivated land haryana s climate is classified as subtropical semi arid to sub humid continental and monsoon type the average rainfall ranges from 300 mm in the south west hot arid zone acz i to over 1000 mm in the shivalik hills mountainous tracks western himalayan warm sub humid zone acz iv anon 2019 20 in case of punjab the hot arid zone acz i receives average annual rainfall 300 mm which increases to 500 700 mm in semi arid zone acz ii followed by hot sub humid zone acz iii and western himalayan warm sub humid zone acz iv 750 1000 mm anon 2020 21 the states of punjab and haryana receives average annual rainfall of nearly 649 mm and 617 mm respectively and maximum rainfall occur during monsoon period i e from june end to september it also receives a small amount of rainfall in december and january due to western disturbances average winter temperature ranges from 11 to 14 c in the area under investigation spring wheat is the dominant crop grown in the area during winter season sowing november december harvesting end of march to mid april 2 2 datasets used the datasets used for this study are discussed in sequel 2 2 1 rainfall data indian meteorological department imd provides open access to daily rainfall data at 0 25 0 25 degree grid daily gridded data for punjab and haryana was downloaded from https www imdpune govin clim pred lrf new grided data download html for the present study 2 2 2 normalize difference vegetation index ndvi data 16 day ndvi data from the mod13q1 collection v006 product of modis terra was procured for the rabi season growing season of the wheat december to march from the lpdaac https lpdaac usgs gov lpdaac tools cloud and other atmospheric disturbances affect the modis ndvi which has a significant impact on the quality of ndvi to overcome this shortcoming lpdaac also provides the quality control flags along with the data improved ndvi data using quality flags was obtained by using modis viirs python toolbox and arc map software monthly composites of ndvi for growing season of wheat from december to march for a period of 19 years 2001 02 to 2019 20 were prepared in arc map 2 2 3 land surface temperature lst data land surface temperature data of modis terra 8 day product mod11a2 collection v006 was obtained from lpdaac for the growing season of wheat from 2001 02 to 2019 20 monthly composites of lst for growing season of wheat were prepared after the quality check in arc map and were then translated from a digital number dn to degree celsius c by using eq 1 1 lst 0 02 dn 273 15 where 0 02 represents the scale factor and dn represent the digital number of the pixel 2 2 4 other data gross primary productivity gpp data from mod17a2hgf v006 acquired from the lpdaac website and groundwater level data obtained from the online archives of india water portal from 2001 to 2020 were also used to understand the impact of droughts on them the groundwater locations taken into consideration were between 571 and 722 from 2001 to 2020 as some borewells become dysfunctional due to declining groundwater level or for some other reasons and on the other hand some new borewells are drilled from time to time 2 2 5 data quality and integrity data quality flags provided by lpdaac were used for the quality analysis of gpp using modis viirs python toolbox and arc map software to assess the validity of gpp wheat yield predicted from the gpp was compared with actual economic wheat yield obtained from the statistical abstracts of punjab and haryana further both the yields were year wise correlated with each other and the results indicated moderate to strong positive correlation in each acz due to linear positive correlation between gpp derive wheat yield and economic wheat yield gpp was used for the correlation analysis with nvswi also bandyopadhyay et al 2018 studied the accuracy of gridded data from imd 0 25 0 25 with the precipitation data taken from the in situ observatories over india and found its performance satisfactory coefficient of determination r2 values between 0 6 and 0 8 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse value greater than 0 5 in punjab and haryana area 2 3 computation of drought indices 2 3 1 rainfall data time series and computation of spi gridded rainfall data of over 30 years was converted into point data in arc map and monthly time series was prepared from the year 1986 2020 area wise monthly rainfall was averaged for acz i ii and iii to compute the spi r package spei cran repository was used to calculate spi on one 1 there 3 six 6 and twelve 12 month scales for evaluating meteorological drought in this work the index is based on converting aggregated monthly precipitation into a standard normal variable via an equi probability transformation in fact calculating the index entails fitting a probability distribution to aggregated monthly precipitation series e g k 3 6 12 24 months determining the non exceedance probability and identifying the appropriate standard normal quantile as the spi the gamma distribution was found to fit long term rainfall records well in agreement with earlier research mckee et al 1993 livada and assimakopoulos 2007 stagge et al 2015 it is defined as follow eq 2 in terms of a frequency or probability density function 2 γ x 1 β α γ α x α 1 e z β forx 0 in this γ α represents the gamma distribution function x represents the rainfall α is the shape parameter and β is scale parameter for a multiyear data the maximum probability α and β varies as per eq 3 3 α 1 4 a 1 1 4 a 3 β x α wherea ln x ln x n where x is the mean rainfall and n represents the number of measurements as the gamma function remains undefined for x 0 and temporal rainfall data might include 0 rainfall the cumulative probability becomes 4 h x q 1 q g x the probability of 0 rainfall q in temporal dataset is computed by q m n where m denotes the occurrence of 0 rainfall in the temporal rainfall data further h x can be converted into a z score value with a mean of 0 and a unit variance that represents the value gao et al 2018 pandey et al 2021 the spi value 2 0 was considered as extreme drought 2 0 to 1 5 as severe drought 1 5 to 1 0 as moderate drought and 1 0 to 1 0 as normal year 2 4 identification of drought events and their characterization a run is a set of observations of the same type that are preceded and succeeded by one or more unlike observations yevjevich 1967 proposed the run theory for identifying drought parameters and analyzing their statistical features in terms of run length drought duration run sum drought severity and intensity the choice of critical threshold level of the parameter is central to the run theory guerrero salazar and yevjievich 1975 which could be constant and or changes with time the threshold level in the present investigation was set at 1 0 pandey et al 2021 with the royal blue and red color areas fig 2 representing positive and negative mean monthly spi values respectively when the spi remains consistently 0 or negative and achieves a factor reading of 1 0 or less for at least two consecutive months it is considered a drought event a drought event begins when the spi meets the above mentioned criteria and cease when it rises above zero spi 0 stagge et al 2015 pandey et al 2021 the run theory was used to quantify the three key features namely duration severity and intensity of drought occurrences drought duration dd is the time between the start and end of a drought episode in months drought severity ds is defined as the sum of all drought index values over the course of a drought event and drought intensity di is defined as the ratio of severity to drought duration tan et al 2015 nam et al 2015 for the present investigation 12 month spi was considered for the identification of drought events and further seasonal spi from december to march 2001 02 to 2019 20 was correlated with the nvswi derived from ndvi and lst 2 4 1 vegetation health index vhi ndvi provides a good indication of the chlorophyll content and vegetation cover and lst provides a proxy to assess the evapotranspiration from the canopy and soil moisture content karnieli et al 2010 the ndvi derived vegetation condition index vci and lst derived temperature condition index tci has been extensively used to detect the start of a drought as well as its intensity duration and impact the vci and tci for the growing season of wheat december march from 2001 02 to 2019 20 were computed using ndvi and lst data respectively the vci and tci were computed using eqs 5 and 6 respectively reflect the relative greenness and temperature of the plants kogan 1995 1997 5 vci ndvi j ndvi k min ndvi k max ndvi k min 100 6 tci tci k max tci j tci k max tci k min 100 where j represents the month and k represents the year vci and tci as ndvi and lst normalizations emphasize relative variations in local ndvi and lst over time vhi which indicates the health of the vegetation is an additional combination of the vci and tci with the same weight assuming an even contribution from two parameters eq 7 7 vhi α vci 1 α tci since vci and tci reflect distinct features of the vegetation response to drought and are independent of one another a weighted summation rather than a simple addition provides the optimum fusion performance sun and kafatos 2007 hence α in eq 7 represents the weights that is a constant value 0 5 for this study 2 4 2 computation of vegetation supply water index vswi and normalized vegetation supply water index nvswi another most extensively used agricultural drought indicator is the vswi carlson et al 1990 vswi reflects the linkages between changes in the temperature of the canopy and soil water supply chen et al 2018 sandeep et al 2021 vegetation having adequate soil water supply has a relatively lower lst while lst will be high over the vegetated areas with inadequate soil water supply tan et al 2004 during a drought event content of available soil water is likely to be smaller due to the high temperature resulting in an intensified evapotranspiration rate vswi was computed using eq 8 from 2001 02 to 2019 20 december march 8 vswi ndvi lst the larger values of vswi indicates elevated vegetation transpiration and higher soil water content and vice versa this ndvi lst ratio is useful for determining the type of agricultural drought that endures in a given area due to variations in plant cover and soil moisture stress rabi season ndvi and lst generated from modis v 006 product for 19 years was used to compute vswi which was then normalized to develop normalized vegetation supply water index nvswi abbas et al 2014 using following eq 9 9 nvswi vswi vswi min vswi max vswi min 100 where vswi is vegetation supply water index for the wheat growing period vswi min and vswi max are minimum and maximum value of vswi of the pixel during the period of study respectively the value of nvswi ranges between 0 and 100 zero indicating severe drought and 100 representing wettest conditions severe drought values below 20 moderate drought 20 40 minor drought 40 60 normal 60 80 and wet values over 80 were used to classify the index values 2 5 correlation analysis of seasonal nvswi with vhi spi gpp and groundwater level drought occurrence and severity are influenced by rainfall which is one of the most important climatic elements since rainfall variability and abnormality have a strong influence on drought severity seasonal spi 12 december to march was utilized as an independent variable to examine its correlation with the seasonal nvswi during the dry and normal years gross primary productivity gpp reflects the organic productivity of the ecosystem beer et al 2010 delucia et al 2019 droughts one of the most severe climate extremes endanger global carbon balance reichstein et al 2013 zhao and running 2010 and food security song et al 2018 as they limit the vegetative carbon uptake since it is important to understand the impact of drought on the gpp of the ecosystem therefore relationships between nvswi and gpp were also worked out zonal statistics using administrative area i e number of taluks in each acz over the agricultural pixels was used to get the mean spi nvswi and gpp for their correlation analysis moreover agricultural production in this area is dependent on the irrigation practices and these states are among the largest users of groundwater to increase the crop yield and to achieve the food security higher production during rain deficit times heavily relies on the groundwater resources thus relationships between nvswi and groundwater level and their trend analysis were also carried out 2 6 trend analysis of nvswi and groundwater level using mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator the non parametric mann kendall test kendall 1975 mann 1945 is widely used in detecting the trends in environmental variables yue et al 2002 tabari and marofi 2011 gocic and trajkovic 2013 due to its insensitivity to the normal distribution of data and outliers the mann kendall test in r software cran repository was used to perform trend analysis for nvswi december march from 2001 02 to 2019 20 and groundwater level january april from 2002 to 2020 besides a simple non parametric approach i e statistics of slope proposed by sen 1968 was also used to assess the magnitude of trend in the sample of n pairs of data details about the mann kendall test kendall 1975 mann 1945 wang et al 2013 ribeiro et al 2015 baig et al 2022 and sen s slope estimator are already well established in literature gocic and trajkovic 2013 he and gautam 2016 the study area was divided into 3 zones each for punjab and haryana as groundwater use for irrigation in punjab and haryana is differently controlled and the mean nvswi and mean groundwater level were used for the trend analysis in the aczs of each state 3 results and discussions 3 1 rainfall characteristics in the study area the maximum annual rainfall in acz i acz ii and acz iii was recorded in the years 2004 05 2019 20 and 2006 07 respectively the long term 1986 2020 average annual rainfall december march in the area under investigation was 40 7 mm 67 01 mm and 130 4 mm in acz i acz ii and acz iii respectively also the difference in the mean values of rainfall between acz i and ii acz ii and iii and acz i and iii was 26 4 mm 63 3 mm and 89 8 mm respectively 3 2 drought events frequency and intensity run theory was used to identify and analyze the drought duration dd drought severity ds and drought intensity di based on spi 12 in all 3 aczs of the study area the longest duration of drought witnessed by the acz i was 45 months during the drought event 4 1999 2003 fig 2 a followed by drought event 1 with a 13 month duration drought event 4 was more severe than drought event 1 but the di of drought event 1 was higher fig 2 b acz ii experienced the longest and most severe drought 46 months during the drought event 3 1999 2003 followed by 1987 88 12 days fig 2 c but the di of event 1 was higher than that of event 3 fig 2 d acz iii endured the maximum number of drought events 6 the longest and most severe was during 2004 2007 followed by 2001 2003 and 2016 2018 fig 2 e although this zone suffered the maximum number of drought events the di was 1 0 for most of the events except the drought events 1 1987 88 and 6 2016 18 which indicated the di 1 0 fig 2 f as a result increased drought occurrences in acz i and ii might have an influence on crop yields due to decreased rainfall and climate variability 3 2 1 spatio temporal dynamics of spi 12 specifically the shorter time scales of spi values 1 3 and 6 adequately depicts early warning of meteorological drought as well as interim soil moisture and agricultural deficits svoboda et al 2012 the identification of dry normal and wet episodes becomes much more apparent in spi 12 due to its cumulative duration which shows a long term drought trend hydrological drought therefore for the present study spi 12 were considered drought events were considered when the spi 12 value was 1 0 for two consecutive months till the value became positive a perusal of fig 2 indicate that 5 major drought events 1986 88 1989 90 1992 1999 2001 2002 03 in acz i 4 in acz ii 1987 88 1992 1993 1999 2003 and 6 in 1987 88 2002 03 2004 07 2009 10 2014 15 and 2016 18 acz iii were identified in the present study spatial distribution maps of spi for the growing season of wheat december march from 2001 02 to 2019 20 is shown in fig 3 it is evident from the fig 3 that spi varied spatially and each zone endured drought events at different times the driest spell of spi 2 0 to the wettest spell spi 2 0 varied significantly in all the aczs however the year 2008 09 was the wet year for all the aczs but the spatial extent of wetness was larger in the acz i and acz ii in acz iii 2011 12 was the wettest year with maximum precipitation in the northern part of the study area as far as the drought events are concerned all the zones experienced the rabi season drought on temporally different scales the driest year for acz i acz ii and acz iii were 2002 03 2014 15 and 2016 17 respectively and therefore being the driest years these were selected for the further analysis to determine the impact of drought events on vhi nvswi and gpp 3 3 dynamics of ndvi lst vci tci vhi and gpp from 2001 02 to 2019 20 ndvi could be utilized as a robust parameter for monitoring soil surface moisture allowing drought occurrences to be easily identified the mean ndvi value in the acz i was lowest in 2002 03 while the highest mean ndvi and good vegetation cover were recorded in 2018 19 the lowest seasonal mean ndvi was observed in acz ii and acz iii in 2001 02 whereas good vegetation growth was observed in the years 2018 2020 the acz i had the lowest ndvi 0 20 values every year whereas the acz ii was found to be the greenest of the three aczs for the chosen time period from 2013 14 onwards good vegetation growth ndvi 0 60 was observed in the acz i and from 2017 2020 the entire study area had a healthy vegetation cover vci fig 4 also indicated the highest values of vci during this period the increase in good vegetation cover from 2017 onwards could be attributed to near normal rainfall during these years as seen in fig 3 where spi values for the whole research area were almost normal throughout these years the growing season ndvi analysis reveals that the acz i had poor vegetation cover for the majority of the years whereas acz ii has reasonably good vegetation cover however due to high temperatures and unpredictable rainfall agricultural lands have been under severe stress due to climatic variables the croplands of acz i and acz iii are experiencing severe vegetal degradation and have had a negative impact on crop vegetative growth the vci derived from the ndvi is shown in fig 4 which also demonstrated that acz i and iii often have the lowest vci values the maximum seasonal lst of 32 88 c was recorded in the years 2005 06 in the southwestern part haryana of the study area and temperatures in this part remained high during the entire period of investigation the minimum seasonal lst i e 16 55 c and 16 56 c was observed in the years 2018 19 and 2019 20 mainly in the northern part punjab the spatial extent of lst 20 c was prevalent in the major part of the study area during 2011 12 and 2018 19 while lst 26 c prevailed over the study area during the years from 2001 02 to 2005 06 2008 09 2009 10 and 2015 16 in general the lst in the northwestern part of the study area remained low while lst was usually high in the southwestern part the lowest value of tci depicts the driest soil moisture conditions while high values of tci reflect the wet conditions the lowest tci i e 40 0 was mainly prevalent in acz i in most of the years acz ii had the lowest tci 31 in its major part in 2014 15 while acz iii and some parts of acz ii had low tci 32 in 2016 17 fig 5 the spatial distribution maps of vegetation health index vhi derived from the weighted linear combination of vci and tci given in fig 6 despite the fact that the majority of the study area did not exhibit a drought vhi 40 condition during the period of this study acz i consistently exhibited low vhi values the linear relationship between vci and tci the omission of a normalizing component for the computation of vhi from vci and tci and classification thresholds may explain why vhi did not reflect drought conditions in acz ii and acz iii fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of mean gpp over the selected agro climatic zones of punjab and haryana for wheat growing season gpp was significantly higher in acz ii from 2001 02 to 2007 08 while its lowest values were observed in acz i for the same time period from 2013 14 onwards acz i hot arid zone of punjab and haryana had experienced increased seasonal gpp which might be due to the near normal rainfall conditions in the acz i since gpp is sensitive to dry and wet conditions wang et al 2018 high gpp values in acz ii and acz iii could be due to their heavy reliance on groundwater for irrigation practices and climate type table 1 3 4 agricultural drought assessment from nvswi spatio temporal analysis of nvswi indicated that the acz i suffered recurring moderate to light drought occurrences during the period of study fig 8 however the worst drought events occurred in the years 2001 02 2002 03 2003 04 and 2005 06 and the ndvi values were also relatively low during these events from table 2 it is also clear that more than 75 of the agricultural area in the acz i remained in the slight to severe drought category and from 2010 onwards the area under this category showed progressive decrease in acz ii 80 agricultural area was under slight to severe drought in the years 2001 02 2002 03 2003 04 2005 06 and 2009 10 while during 2018 19 and 2019 20 it decreased significantly in 2015 16 severe to slight droughts were recorded in parts of haryana state but when moving towards punjab the area under slight drought was reduced it is also noticeable that during these drought events the area under severe to slight drought in acz ii of haryana was greater when compared to punjab the area under severe to slight drought in acz iii was more than 80 in 2001 02 2002 03 2003 04 2005 06 2009 10 and 2015 16 but it has been reduced to nearly 20 in 2018 19 and also majority of the area remained drought free during 2018 20 although all the aczs experienced the agricultural drought at different time periods during the year 2009 10 majority of the study area 75 of the area of acz i 85 of acz ii and 84 of iii remained under a slight drought indicating the maximum spatial extent of the agricultural area during the year 2018 19 and 2019 20 all the aczs remained almost drought free except a few scattered pockets and spi during this time period also reflected normal conditions however as per spi the wettest years were 2008 09 and 2011 12 but the optimum soil moisture content timing and frequency of irrigation and rainfall temperature co2 concentration tropospheric ozone o3 concentration pests and fertilizer use also plays a major role for plant growth daloz et al 2021 time of early drought and low soil moisture content affects the germination formation of seedling and early vigor while terminal droughts influence the ear formation and grain filling of wheat which might be overcome by artificial irrigation latiri et al 2010 hence the study shows that nvswi may be used to map monitor and assess agricultural dryness especially in arid and semi arid regions 3 5 correlation analysis between nvswi vhi spi and gpp nvswi vhi spi and gpp over the agricultural pixels in the aczs were correlated with each other to determine the relationships and robustness of nvswi to detect the drought fig 9 during dry years 2002 03 in acz i 2014 15 in acz ii 2016 17 in acz iii the results showed positive linear relationship between drought severity and vegetation health the correlation coefficient between nvswi and vhi r 0 92 for acz i fig 9 a r 0 753 for acz ii fig 9 d r 0 935 for acz iii fig 9 g indicated positive linear relationship between drought severity and vegetation health the very high positive correlation between nvswi and vhi reflects the ability of nvswi to capture soil moisture conditions and vegetation conditions sandeep et al 2021 the moderate positive correlation coefficients r 0 545 between nvswi and spi in acz i indicated the importance of rainfall for crop growth in hot arid areas fig 9 b in 2002 03 a major part of the acz i was under severe to slight drought and spi values were also low during that year so it was also subjected to corresponding lowering of gross primary productivity gpp also indicated a very strong positive correlation with the nvswi figs 9 and 10 c f i thus showing the effectiveness of the nvswi to capture the organic carbon productivity of wheat although spi 12 indicated a dry season during the year 2014 15 in acz ii and nearly 38 of its area was under severe to slight drought conditions the spatial extent of the drought was much lower than the drought extent of 2009 10 the high drought extent shown by nvswi in the year 2009 10 fig 8 might be due to the lower rainfall in different parts of all the aczs fig 3 irrigation has a significant impact on raising soil moisture which enhances the green vegetation fraction and gross primary output wu et al 2018 the moderate positive correlation between spi and nvswi in acz i and acz ii and the insignificant correlation in acz iii during dry fig 9 b e h and normal year fig 10 b e h might be due to the prevalence of groundwater based irrigation practices in the area when considering the correlation between nvswi and spi in acz iii the correlation was insignificant during dry fig 9 h as well as normal year fig 10 h during the normal rainfall year i e 2018 19 the whole study area was free from drought and an increase in nvswi vhi and gpp values was also observed a significant positive correlation was again observed between nvswi and vhi during the normal year 2018 19 in all the aczs fig 10 a d g low nvswi values indicate drought conditions and under drought conditions the plants do not get sufficient water for their metabolic activities which hinders their normal photosynthetic activities and their stored organic carbon also gets reduced the strong positive correlation between nvswi and gpp acz i r 0 954 acz ii r 0 811 and acz iii r 0 81 in dry fig 9 c f i and normal conditions acz i r 0 885 acz ii r 0 849 and acz iii moderate positive correlation coefficient r 0 685 fig 10 c f i in all aczs demonstrated the effectiveness of nvswi in identifying drought conditions and subsequent changes in the organic carbon storage of the biomass 3 6 groundwater level and nvswi spatio temporal variations in groundwater level during the pre and post monsoon season are shown in figs 11 and 12 respectively the figures show that groundwater level remained 15 0 m below ground level m bgl in major part of acz i ii and iii from 2001 to 2007 since 2007 there has been a noticeable decline in groundwater levels and the maximum decline was observed in the central part of the study area i e acz ii the deepest groundwater level 35 0 m bgl was found in the southern part of haryana acz i from the year 2002 onwards and the area falling into this category has grown since then the central part of acz ii experienced the greatest groundwater decline from 2001 and 2020 groundwater levels in the majority of its acz ii area declined from 15 0 m bgl in 2001 to 35 0 40 0 m bgl in 2019 20 in some places the groundwater became deeper than 40 0 m bgl central part of acz iii also witnessed the groundwater level situation similar to acz ii according to rodell et al 2009 and asoka et al 2018 groundwater level decline in western indo gangetic plains was primarily caused by pumping and long term declines in monsoonal precipitation therefore low groundwater recharging and increased groundwater withdrawal for irrigation purposes resulted in groundwater decline in major parts of acz ii and iii of punjab and haryana further moderate positive and insignificant correlation between spi and nvswi instigated a need to further investigate the role of surface and ground water in wheat production in the study area the aczs were state wise divided to know the relationships between mean groundwater level april and mean nvswi values from the 2001 02 to 2019 20 fig 13 in 2002 the mean groundwater level in acz i of punjab was 5 m bgl which reached at 10 m bgl in 2020 fig 13 b while in haryana it was 12 4 m bgl in the year 2002 and it touched 17 m bgl during 2020 fig 13 d although this zone is suffering from the problem of water logging and salinity and most of its area is under canal irrigation in both the states but intensive agricultural practices have proliferated the use of deeper groundwater to irrigate the fields the groundwater level and nvswi had a correlation coefficient of 0 864 and 0 68 in acz i of punjab and haryana respectively fig 13 depicts that mean nvswi showed an increasing trend while the mean groundwater level had a declining trend in case of acz ii of punjab the mean groundwater level was 11 m bgl in the year 2002 and declined to 25 m bgl in the year 2020 fig 13 b while in case of haryana it was 9 m bgl and reached 17 m bgl in the year 2020 fig 13 d the mean nvswi and the mean groundwater level in punjab and haryana exhibited a moderate and strong negative trend of 0 422 and 0 72 respectively indicating a significant use of groundwater irrigation and monsoon vagaries the acz ii in both the states heavily rely on the groundwater for agricultural production the groundwater level in this zone is declining at an alarming rate and some areas are also facing the problems of water shortage and deeper water table moreover acz ii also remained green in most of the years during the period of study which is clear reflection of groundwater use for irrigational practices the nvswi in acz ii of punjab remained higher than the other two zones till 2012 2013 and it was mostly at the cost of groundwater the mean groundwater level in punjab s acz iii was 10 m bgl in 2002 and declined to 17 m bgl in 2020 fig 13 b whereas nvswi values showed a mixed trend in the acz ii of punjab fig 13 a and increasing trend in haryana fig 13 c it also indicated a moderate negative correlation of 0 49 and 0 39 between nvswi and groundwater level in punjab and haryana respectively the mann kendall trend analysis along with sen s slope is given in table 3 the trends at 95 and 99 confidence level α 0 05 and α 0 01 show that there is a significant trend for nvswi and groundwater level in punjab and haryana except for acz ii in punjab and acz iii in haryana the highest increase in nvswi were observed in acz i 1 23 acz iii 1 13 of haryana and acz i 1 05 of punjab as per the sen s slope estimator q med acz iii of punjab exhibited a 0 64 year increase while the acz ii of haryana reflected an increase of 0 67 year in nvswi however the nvswi values in the acz ii of punjab have not shown any significant increasing trend but a significant decreasing trend of 0 76 year was observed in groundwater level in this zone it reflects that agriculture in this zone was mostly based on irrigation from groundwater and nvswi values almost remained high from 2002 to 2020 but kept on oscillating fig 13 a hence the trend was not significant according to sen s slope q med acz ii of haryana also presented a highly significant negative trend of 0 41 year along with a highly significant increasing trend of 0 67 in nvswi values the lowest highly significant declining trends of 0 26 year and 0 27 year in groundwater level were recorded in the acz i of punjab and haryana where irrigation is mostly restricted to surface water due to inland aquifer salinity and water logging conditions thus reflecting the sporadic nature of groundwater based irrigation 4 discussions from the above observations it can be inferred that meteorological drought varied spatio temporally in all the aczs the results of spi indicated that acz iii hot sub humid witnessed the maximum 6 number of drought events while the least 4 drought events were experienced by acz i hot arid at different time periods but drought events from 2001 to 2003 were experienced by all the aczs from spi 12 values it could be concluded that acz iii i e the hot sub humid zone witnessed more drought events than acz i and acz ii spi 12 also covered the drought events of 1987 and 2002 03 which are well documented in the earlier studies saini et al 2020 rainfall as well as the soil water storage reflected a negative anomaly during 1987 88 2002 03 2004 07 drought events over punjab and haryana mukherjee et al 2019 and the tci in our present investigation indicates low soil moisture conditions in acz i from 2001 02 to 2010 11 crop yield is eventually impacted by severe drought conditions during the growing season rhee et al 2010 and hence the crop yield decreased mukherjee et al 2019 drought duration dd drought severity ds and drought intensity di also varied across the acz the spatial distribution maps of spi and nvswi also implied that areas that reflected the meteorological droughts during dry years in different aczs also showed the agricultural droughts however in the acz iii hot sub humid zone discrepancies were observed different drought indices appear to measure the severity of the drought differently kundu et al 2020 hashemzadeh ghalhari et al 2022 as per vhi majority of the area in acz ii and iii was free from drought but nvswi and spi captured the drought episodes efficiently in these zones punjab and haryana witnessed a prolonged period of analogously low wheat yield from the year 2002 03 to 2010 11 mukherjee et al 2010 the distribution maps of nvswi fig 8 and gpp fig 7 also indicated their lower values from 2001 to 2011 in acz i and acz iii the gpp of vegetation is controlled by water availability wang et al 2018a zhang et al 2018b walther et al 2019 thus its high correlation with nvswi also supports the effectiveness of nvswi in capturing the drought events high correlation between nvswi and vhi and gpp indicated that increased low soil moisture content also impact the vegetation dynamics and organic carbon in crop biomass since low correlation between nvswi and spi reflected less impact of meteorological drought on irrigated areas the outcome of nvswi and spi correlation in the present investigation are consistent with the study conducted by ambika and mishra 2019 which also demonstrated the high correlation r between nvswi and spi in non irrigated and lower correlation r in irrigated agricultural regions of the indo gangetic plains groundwater based irrigation dominates the western parts of the indo gangetic plain i e haryana and punjab which has been the main cause for the declining groundwater levels in punjab and haryana rodell et al 2009 mishra et al 2016 asoka et al 2017 kaur and rishi 2018 mishra et al 2018 kaur et al 2020 irrigation in acz ii and iii is mainly dependent on groundwater and high agricultural production resulted in decline in groundwater level thus with increased frequency of droughts and rapidly declining groundwater levels in punjab and haryana crop production may decrease and food security may be jeopardized 5 conclusion as per the results of spi acz iii witnessed maximum drought episodes as compared to acz i and ii the driest years were 2002 03 acz i 2014 15 acz ii and 2016 17 acz iii respectively the spatio temporal maps of nvswi were suggestive that ndvi and lst can have the potential to detect vegetation health and soil moisture which can be used for agricultural drought monitoring the nvswi indicated that during the 2002 03 drought event a major part of all the aczs experienced severe to slight agricultural drought according to the spatial distribution map of spi drought was observed in the southeastern part of acz ii and the area that had the lowest rainfall also indicated the lowest nvswi in acz iii the spatial distribution map of spi 12 indicated meteorological drought and nvswi also exhibited severe to slight agricultural drought in this zone the spi map also showed that the year 2018 19 was a normal year in terms of meteorological drought and the same was supported by nvswi correlation between nvswi and vhi indicated that ndvi and lst ratios can be used effectively in monitoring droughts in arid and semi arid regions the high correlation between nvswi and gpp provides an identification of drought conditions and subsequent changes in biomass organic carbon storage a poor correlation between nvswi and spi portrayed less influence of meteorological drought on vegetation dynamics due to groundwater based irrigation practices in acz ii and acz iii further trend analysis of nvswi and groundwater level indicated an increasing and decreasing mean trend respectively in all the acz the mann kendall and sen slope tests revealed that the groundwater is being used extensively for irrigation in acz ii semi arid where maximum groundwater decline 0 75 m year in punjab and 0 40 m year in haryana was observed hence it can be inferred that the occurrence of meteorological and agricultural droughts in the agroclimatic zones of punjab and haryana varies spatio temporally modis based nvswi vhi ndvi and lst are efficient remote sensing indices to monitor agricultural droughts and their high temporal resolution might prove helpful in ensuring food security and groundwater level management moreover groundwater level in this area is depleting at a fast pace due to extensive irrigation practices in the semi arid zone hence efficient management practices and strict policy measures need to be implemented on the ground funding not applicable data availability statement data availability statement rainfall and

canal scheduling is essential to reduce water conveyance loss however the existing optimal irrigation scheduling models oisms still have deficiencies in dealing with spatial temporal variability of water conveyance losses which seriously limits the model performance in many irrigation areas with high spatial temporal variability borrowing a concept from hydrology we propose a dynamic calculation method of canal water conveyance loss dmwcl in which antecedent water conveyance index awci is defined to represent the effects of antecedent soil water content upon infiltration losses and the integral flow balance method is adopted to describe the characteristics of canal discharge decreasing along the canal reach based on the dmwcl we present a novel canal scheduling model with the potential to adapt to spatial temporal variability dmwcl cs the new model is applied to the hetao irrigation district inner mongolia a typical agricultural watershed in china our results across the case studies show that the canal water delivery schedule derived by the dmwcl cs model reduces water conveyance loss and improves irrigation performance ranging from 2 49 million m3 to 10 60 million m3 in 2014 and from 0 60 million m3 to 6 17 million m3 in 2016 respectively compared to that of three additional models interestingly we find that the water delivery schedule of the dmwcl cs model accelerates the wetting process of the canal bed soil to reduce the water conveyance loss and increases the discharge to adapt to the characteristics that the discharge decreases along the canal reach the dmwcl cs model provides essential insights for irrigation managers to formulate a canal water delivery schedule that adapts to spatial temporal variability the proposed framework is generic and can be integrated into any oism keywords irrigation canal scheduling canal water conveyance loss spatial temporal variability dynamic calculation method antecedent water conveyance index data

severe water scarcity during at least one month of the year and this stress level will continue to increase as water demand grows united nations educational and organization 2019 agricultural irrigation accounts for 69 of the global water withdrawal dominating global water use unfortunately water use efficiency in this sector is abysmal by submitted global values mostly below 50 kilic and tuylu 2011 kulkarni and nagarajan 2019 thus agricultural water saving is of utmost importance for alleviating the water shortage crisis compared to other irrigation activities canal scheduling has more influence on the irrigation system s performance vaidyanathan 1992 canal scheduling directly affects the quality of irrigation service over irrigation would lead to spillage losses and even groundwater pollution and soil salinization conversely insufficient irrigation results in crop yield losses due to a deficit water supply kaur et al 2013 furthermore efficient canal scheduling could significantly reduce water conveyance loss guo et al 2019 liu et al 2018 peng et al 2012 water conveyance loss in canals accounts for 30 50 of the total volume of water transported in iran kulkarni and nagarajan 2019 these proportions are as high as 45 and 66 in india and pakistan respectively mohammadi et al 2019 in china the water use coefficient of the backbone canal system in large scale irrigation areas in 2015 was only 0 597 which means that more than 40 were lost during conveyance national development and reform commission 2017 accordingly canal conveyance loss significantly affects irrigation efficiency which magnifies the importance of reasonable irrigation scheduling strategies for improving the utilization efficiency of irrigation water the main task of canal scheduling is to reasonably determine the time and amount of water delivery in the irrigation area according to crop water demand and available irrigation water under the fixed physical characteristics of a canal system bhadra et al 2010 molden and gates 1990 notwithstanding canal irrigation scheduling is a multi level and multi objective problem the distribution of the canal system is hierarchical in practice and the requirements of decision makers may vary with each other delgoda et al 2017 guo et al 2019 prespecifying an accurate water demand and available water supply is challenging due to the multiplicities of uncertainties in canal scheduling peng et al 2019 wang et al 2015 the issues described above and the interactions among the physical social economic and organizational factors that uniquely affect each irrigation system make the canal scheduling a complex task mishra et al 2002 moreover water loss estimation from canals involves many complicated mechanisms that pose various difficulties for researchers and canal administrators canal seepage depends upon many factors including the hydraulic conductivity of canal bed soil channel geometry constraints on groundwater flow and hydraulic characteristics of the canal flow such as water depth flow velocity and length of the wetted perimeter akbar et al 2013 alam and bhutta 2004 shah et al 2020 swamee et al 2002 yussuff et al 1994 these factors vary along a canal reach and integrate over time contributing to ambiguity in assessing seepage losses martin and gates 2014 canal discharge is an important hydraulic parameter that affects canal conveyance efficiency bakry and awad 1997 kinzli et al 2010 mohammadi et al 2019 canal discharge gradually decreases along the canal reach due to seepage khepar et al 2000 resulting in the spatial variability of water conveyance loss in addition the water permeability of a canal bed highly depends on its soil moisture condition which is the crucial driving force for water infiltration into the soil furman et al 2006 the infiltration rate decreases nonlinearly as soil moisture increases and finally approaches a stable rate when the soil is saturated horton 1941 philip 1957 yang et al 2020 during canal scheduling the water content in the soil profile of the canal bed often changes due to periodic water filling and drying thus the canal water conveyance loss also shows the temporal variability owing to the change in soil moisture content moavenshahidi et al 2015 yao et al 2012 recent decades have witnessed the development of canal scheduling models this development includes the expansion of the research scope from a single hierarchical layer of the canal network to multiple hierarchical layers and then to the whole irrigation network from a water source to a field kanooni and monem 2014 wang et al 1995 wardlaw and bhaktikul 2004 meanwhile the objective functions increased from a single objective of a single stakeholder to multiple objectives of several stakeholders delgoda et al 2017 guo et al 2019 khepar et al 2000 from another perspective solution algorithms have been developed from linear programming to nonlinear programming and then to heuristic methods anwar and clarke 2001 benli and kodal 2003 pawde et al 2013 suryavanshi and reddy 1986 notwithstanding the spatial and temporal variability of water conveyance loss from canals has been neglected or simplified in the previous studies which often resulted in a plan far from the optimal canal schedule santhi and pundarikanthan 2000 some researchers use a discount method to estimate the water conveyance loss for example conveyance losses of 30 were assumed by wardlaw and bhaktikul 2004 to apply their canal scheduling model in the indira gandhi nahar pariyojana irrigation system in northwest india in a study on the canal scheduling model during the dry season of purnahara irrigation district in india mishra et al 2008 assume that water conveyance loss in the field channel and distributary can be calculated as 20 and 15 of the total water delivery respectively peng et al 2012 adopted 4 and 9 as the water loss rates of branch canals and the main canal to calculate the seepage losses in their canal scheduling research of the nanguan main canal system in gaoyou irrigation area china similarly conveyance efficiencies of minors and distributaries in the upper wardha irrigation system of india are assumed as 80 and 90 respectively pawde et al 2013 the discount method is simple and easy to use but it is too rough to calculate the canal conveyance loss accurately some researchers assume that the water seepage loss is proportional to the length of the canal and can be calculated by the product of a known loss factor and the water delivery distance delgoda et al 2017 gonçalves et al 2007 kaur et al 2013 however this method ignores the spatial variability of water conveyance loss along the canal reach caused by the change of canal discharge measurement methods have been used to quantify canal water conveyance loss of canal systems santhi and pundarikanthan 2000 measured canal losses through flow measurements and ponding method when they made the scheduling plan of rotation irrigation for the sathanur irrigation project in india similarly mangrio et al 2016 used an inflow outflow method to measure conveyance losses in applying their crop based irrigation operation model in the mirpurkhas subdivision pakistan these measuring methods are very accurate but are challenging to popularize as they cost a lot of time workforce and equipment moreover empirical equations such as the kostiakov equation were often used to estimate water conveyance loss in the scheduling model azargashb lord et al 2021 guo et al 2019 khepar et al 2000 liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 in such cases the hydraulic parameters of a specific cross section like the beginning or end of the canal are used to calculate the water conveyance loss of the whole canal when other influential parameters such as soil permeability and lining conditions are considered constants although such equations are convenient for applications they involve considerable simplification and cannot correctly show the development of seepage in space and time yao et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 salemi and sepaskhah 2001 and akkuzu 2012 revealed the considerable inaccuracy in moritz and davis wilson equations and found that estimated water conveyance losses are significantly lower than the measured values zhang et al 2017 found that the water conveyance losses estimated by the kostiakov equation are 2 5 10 times higher than the field observations shah et al 2020 proved that the moritz and kostiakov equations overestimated the seepage by 53 and 158 respectively furthermore they stated that the davis wilson equation overwhelmingly underestimated the seepage the primary deficiency of the above canal scheduling models is neglecting the temporal and spatial variability of water conveyance loss over the scheduling time and along the canal reach neglecting those characteristics would cause severe overestimation or underestimation of water conveyance loss resulting in an inefficient water delivery schedule therefore there is an urgent need to develop a canal scheduling model that can comprehensively consider the spatial temporal variability of water loss accordingly the ultimate objective of this study is to propose a novel model for finding an optimal canal water delivery schedule that adapts to the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of water conveyance loss to this end a dynamic calculation model of canal water conveyance loss dmwcl is proposed subsequently a novel canal optimal scheduling model dmwcl cs with the potential to adjust to spatial temporal variability is developed the novelty of this study is that the dmwcl cs model optimizes the canal scheduling according to the spatial temporal variability of water conveyance loss which can significantly improve the canal water use efficiency the dmwcl cs model offers a fresh perspective on the optimization of canal scheduling by considering the change in soil moisture condition of the canal bed over the scheduling time and the change of canal discharge along the canal reach the methods and findings of this study are expected to provide some valuable insights for improving canal scheduling the remainder part of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the dmwcl and dmwcl cs models while three additional models for comparison in the optimal scheduling of a two level backbone canal system are explained section 3 describes the study area and the calibration and validation of the dmwcl model section 4 presents the optimization results of the dmwcl cs model and evaluates it in comparison with other models section 5 discusses the comparative results and reveals the influence of the temporal and spatial variability of the water conveyance loss on irrigation canal schedule and eventually section 6 summarizes the key conclusions and prospects for the future research direction 2 methodology the present study establishes four canal scheduling models each consisting of an optimization module and a module for calculating canal water conveyance loss the optimization module generates a canal water delivery schedule and the calculation module estimates the canal water conveyance losses of a water delivery schedule in the calculation module of canal water conveyance loss we improve the kostiakov formula by considering the temporal variability and spatial variability of canal water conveyance loss referring to the concept of antecedent precipitation index in hydrology we defined the antecedent water conveyance index as a symbolic index of soil moisture condition in the canal bed we further established functional relationships between this index and the water permeability parameters of canal bed in the kostiakov formula thus forming the vt model that can describe the temporal variability of canal water conveyance loss on the other hand we integrate the kosgakov formula on the infinitesimal canal element to obtain the functional relationship between the canal discharge and the water conveyance distance we use this functional relationship and the flow balance method to calculate the canal water conveyance loss thus forming the vs model that describes the spatial variability of canal water conveyance loss furthermore combined with the above two improvements we have established the dmwcl model that describes both the temporal and spatial variability of canal water conveyance loss we integrate the k model the vt model the vs model and the dmwcl model into the canal optimization scheduling module forming four canal scheduling models the k cs model the vt cs model the vs cs model and the dmwcl cs model the framework of this study is shown in fig 1 2 1 general canal scheduling model fig 2 illustrates a schematic of the most common two level canal network the upper layer is the main canal consisting of m canal sections the lower layer has n branch canals connected with z irrigation sub areas in this study the proposed irrigation canal scheduling model aims to minimize the water conveyance loss of the superior canal and simultaneously minimize the crop water shortage in the lower irrigation sub area these objectives could be mathematically expressed through eq 1 as expressed in eq 2 the optimization model is subjected to capacity constraint water availability constraint water balance constraint non negative constraint and equity constraints to ensure the feasibility of the solution when the decision variables of the model are the discharges of each subordinate canal during the canal scheduling process 1 m i n i m i z e w s j 1 n t 1 t max w d j t q d j t δ t 0 m i n

the capacity constraint which means that the canals discharge shall not exceed their designed discharges at any time interval to ensure safety and stable operation eq 2b represents the water availability constraint the total diversion discharge the summation of net discharge and discharge loss of the upper canal u 1 at the beginning of the upper canal shall not exceed the inflow of the irrigation area eq 2c represents the water balance constraint denoting the equality of inflow and outflow at the water diversion nodes of the lower canals eq 2d is the non negative constraint guaranteeing the nonexistence of negative discharge during the calculation eq 2e denotes the equity constraint due to the possible differences between the inflow and water demand in the irrigation area water shortage may occur in the irrigation sub area of each subordinate canal hence to ensure water allocation equity the difference between maximum and minimum water shortages rate i e r max and r min should be kept within a reasonable range i e r eq 2f calculates the water shortages rate utilized in eq 2e eq 2g calculates the water conveyance loss along the canal through the four models i e k vs vt and dmwcl in fig 1 which are thoroughly explained in the following sections finally eq 2h calculates the connection coefficients used in eq 2c 2 2 water conveyance loss module the present study develops several new approaches for calculating canal water conveyance loss by improving the kostiakov empirical formula the dmwcl model considers the temporal and spatial variability of canal water conveyance loss the vs cs and vt cs models consider only spatial variability and temporal variability respectively 2 2 1 description of temporal variability of water conveyance loss over the scheduling time to characterize water conveyance loss variation over the scheduling time we propose the antecedent water conveyance index as a symbolic index of soil moisture in canal bed and associate it with soil permeability parameters to establish functional relationships the soil water content is a helpful index that accurately represents the soil moisture condition in the canal bed however due to the high cost of direct measurement and significant temporal and spatial variability in soil water content it is challenging to consider this factor in large scale water scheduling management of irrigated areas referring to the concepts of antecedent precipitation index api and normalized antecedent precipitation index napi in hydrology ali et al 2010 heggen 2001 zhao et al 2011 this paper proposes antecedent water conveyance index awci and normalized antecedent water conveyance index nawci as indirect indicators of the soil moisture condition in the canal bed mathematically awci and nawci could be defined as follows see appendix a for the derivation process 3 a w c i t k a w c i t 1 v t 1 a w c i t a w c i max 4 n a w c i t a w c i t a w c i max the k in eq 3 is a parameter affected by the soil properties and climatic conditions reflecting the decay rate of soil water content in the canal bed due to infiltration and evaporation a w c i max is affected by the soil properties and canal water delivery capacity note that canal water delivery affects the soil s water storage capacity in the area surrounding the canal due to the variation of these two parameters in different soil types they should be calibrated through experimental observations when eq 3 is used to calculate a w c i the initial value of a w c i can be taken as zero after the canal has stopped water delivery for a long time or a w c i max after the canal has been running continuously with large discharge for a long time 2 2 2 description of spatial variability of water conveyance loss along the canal reach to describe water conveyance loss variation along the canal reach we use the integral method to obtain the functional relationship between canal discharge and cross section position and then calculate water conveyance loss by the water balance equation as depicted in fig 3 q 0 denotes the discharge at the start of the canal reach at two water delivery distances like x and x d x the discharges corresponding to these distances could be denoted by q x and q x dx respectively within the water delivery distance d x the discharge loss can be calculated as follows 5 d q q x d x q x f q d x the discharge q x can be obtained by taking the integral of eq 5 from the start of the canal reach to the cross section at the location x accordingly with respect to the water discharge balance relationship the discharge loss from the start of the canal reach to location x can be expressed as 6 δ q x q 0 q x q 0 0 x f q d x 2 2 3 proposed model for calculation water conveyance loss over the scheduling time and along the canal reach taking into account that eqs 3 and 4 describe the dynamic change process of soil moisture condition in the canal bed over scheduling time and eqs 5 and 6 reflect the spatial variability of water conveyance loss along the canal reach in order to consider both temporal and spatial variability of water conveyance loss the present study proposes a comprehensive and straightforward dynamic model which is formed by combining eqs 3 6 with several prevalent empirical formulas for calculating the water conveyance loss for instance the prototype of the well known kostiakov formula for calculating discharge loss is described as follows 7 σ a 100 q m a 0 0 m 1 to reflect the characteristics of canal discharge decreasing along the way f q in eq 7 can be expressed in the following form 8 f q σ q then according to eqs 5 and 6 the calculation method of canal water conveyance loss considering its spatial variability vs model can be proposed as follows see appendix a for the derivation process 9 q x q 0 m 0 01 a m x 1 m 10 δ q x q 0 q 0 m 0 01 a m x 1 m 11 δ q x q l m 0 01 a m x 1 m q l in eq 7 parameters a and m only depend on the soil type and do vary over time cai et al 2013 suggested that the soil permeability coefficient and index are functions of soil water content therefore this paper considers a and m in eq 7 as a function of normalized antecedent water conveyance index as follows 12 a a n a w c i 13 m m n a w c i by substituting eq 12 and eq 13 into eq 7 the calculation method of canal water conveyance loss considering its temporal variability vt model can be proposed as follows 14 δ q x σ q x 0 01 a n a w c i q 1 m n a w c i x by substituting eq 12 and eq 13 into eq 10 and eq 11 the dynamic calculation model of canal water conveyance loss dmwcl can be proposed as follows 15 δ q x q 0 q 0 m n a w c i 0 01 a n a w c i m n a w c i x 1 m n a w c i 16 δ q x q l m n a w c i 0 01 a n a w c i m n a w c i x 1 m n a w c i q l different functions such as the linear furman et al 2006 power van genuchten 1980 and exponential philip 1986 have been proposed for calculating eq 12 and eq 13 for simplicity in application the present study adopts two linear functions however if desired the same approach could be used for more sophisticated forms these linear functions can be expressed as follows 17 a n a w c i a n a w c i b 18 m n a w c i c n a w c i d where a b c and d are constants these values need to be calibrated 2 2 4 water conveyance loss model calibration the parameters k a w c i max a b c and d in the dmwcl and vt model and a m in the vs and k model must be calibrated upon the measured data on canal water delivery through the inflow outflow method kulkarni and nagarajan 2019 the measured historical flow of canal scheduling is utilized to calculate the canal conveyance loss in each period as shown in eq 19 the seepage in the reach is obtained by a water balance equation in which all the inputs except for seepage are known subsequently the four models for water conveyance loss calculation are used to simulate the water conveyance loss during the canal scheduling period by minimizing the difference between the outcomes of the inflow outflow method and model simulation through pso sadoghi yazdi et al 2012 the optimal values of the above parameters have been determined it is noteworthy that the pso has 120 particles and is executed for 300 iterations 19 q l o s s q i n q o u t q i n t q d i v three statistical criteria including nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient n s e coefficient of determination r 2 and volume error v e are used to assess the simulation performance of the four models for water conveyance loss calculation these statistical criteria could be calculated as follows 20 n s e 1 i t 1 n o i t s i t 2 i t 1 n o i t o a v e 2 21 r 2 i t 1 n o i t o a v e s i t s a v e 2 it 1 n o i t o a v e 2 it 1 n s i t s a v e 2 22 v e s a v e o a v e o a v e 100 greater n s e and r 2 mean better simulation performance while the maximum possible value of these metrics is one conversely the optimal value of v e is zero thus a v e close to zero indicates better simulation performance following yang et al 2020 suggestion these three criteria could be aggregated into the objective function termed e used in pso algorithm as follows 23 e n s e r 2 2 v e e could take a value between 1 and minus infinite while its optimal value equals 1 2 3 the four canal scheduling models the four canal scheduling models including the k cs model the vt cs model the vs cs model and the dmwcl cs model are proposed by embedding the k model the vt model the vs model and the dmwcl model in the general canal scheduling model 2 3 1 k cs model the k cs model uses the kostiakov formula to calculate water conveyance loss so eq 2g can be expressed as follows 24 q u i t 0 01 a u i q u i t 1 m u i l u i 2 3 2 vt cs model the vt cs model uses the vt model to calculate water conveyance loss so eq 2g can be expressed as follows 25 q u i t 0 01 a u i n a w c i u i t q 1 m u i n a w c i u i t l u i 2 3 3 vs cs model the vs cs model uses the vs model to calculate water conveyance loss so eq 2g can be expressed as follows 26 q u i t q u i t m u i 0 01 a u i m u i l u i 1 m u i q u i t 2 3 4 dmwcl cs model the dmwcl cs model utilizes the dmwcl model to calculate the water conveyance loss of each canal water delivery schedule so eq 2g can be expressed as follows 27 q u i t q u i t m n a w c i t 0 01 a n a w c i t l u i 1 m n a w c i t q u i t 2 3 5 canal scheduling model solution the optimization problem in dmwcl cs and comparative models are multi objectives nonconvex and nonlinear to solve these problems the dual objective problem is transformed into a single objective problem by assigning weights to two objectives furthermore the multi constraints problem is transformed into an unconstrained problem through the penalty function method finally a modified pso is employed to solve the eventuated single objective unconstrained problem 2 3 5 1 solution of dual objective problem this study develops a two level irrigation network in which the amount of water conveyance loss of the superior canal and the amount of the crop water shortage in the lower irrigation sub area are the upper and lower canal manager objectives that need to be minimized the two objectives are usually cooperative as they require enough water to be delivered to the irrigation subarea nevertheless the cost of delivering water could be greater than the benefit when a tremendous amount of water is lost due to the superior canal s conveyance loss in this case the two objectives are competitive however it is impractical to stop delivering water to an irrigation area only due to the enormous water conveyance loss in the superior canal thus it can be concluded that the two objectives in the models are mostly cooperative accordingly the weighting method can be adopted to covert the dual objective problem into a single objective problem the present study assumes that the two objectives have the same prominence and considers an equal weight for both objectives i e 0 5 2 3 5 2 constraint processing the multiplicity of the described constraints in eq 2 gives rise to the complexity of the optimization procedure the penalty function approach is employed to reflect these constraints in the fitness function to facilitate the optimization procedure suppose a solution violates a constraint in that case the solution will be penalized and its fitness value multiplied by a penalty factor furthermore when a solution submits a higher violation the value of the penalty factor increases correspondingly consequently the algorithm automatically converges from the infeasible domain to the feasible domain according to the conducted analysis of the constraints in eq 2 their corresponding penalty functions are designed as follows 28 p c u 1 i 1

the globally optimal solution of the four models i e dmwcl cs k cs vs cs and vt cs the present study employs the parallel swarm shuffling evolution algorithm based on particle swarm optimization psse pso jiang et al 2007 the psse pso is a stable global optimization algorithm with high computational efficiency which overcomes the shortcoming of the classical particle swarm optimization algorithm in falling into local optimums in the early stage the psse pso was inspired by the idea of competitive evolution and sub population mixing which begins with randomly generating an initial population and dividing it into multiple sub populations each subpopulation evolves according to the classical pso based on its evolution strategy after a certain number of iterations psse pso exchanges the information by mixing the subpopulations into a population afterward the whole population is divided into multiple subpopulations and the exact process is repeated until the stop criteria of the algorithm are satisfied fig 4 illustrates the flowchart for solving four developed canal scheduling models with the psse pso 3 case study the developed canal scheduling models including k cs vs cs vt cs and dmwcl cs are applied to the hetao irrigation district which is exposed to the water shortage risk due to low precipitation and high evaporation agriculture in hetao irrigation district is highly dependent on irrigation and an abundance of irrigation canals divert water from the yellow river to this area however poor canal scheduling often leads to considerable canal water conveyance losses in hetao irrigation district sun et al 2016 hence improving irrigation water use efficiency by optimal canal scheduling and reducing canal water conveyance loss in this area is essential the summer irrigation period in 2016 a year with water shortages and 2014 a year with sufficient water are selected for optimal canal scheduling through the developed models the summer irrigation period from april 1st to june 29th is divided into 18 time intervals containing five days 3 1 study area 3 1 1 general situation of hetao irrigation district hetao irrigation district is located in inner mongolia autonomous region between 106 20 109 19 e and 40 19 41 18 n it is one of the super large irrigation districts in china and the largest gravity diversion irrigation area in asia from west to east the hetao irrigation district is divided into five sub irrigated areas wulanbuhe jiefangzha yongji yichang and wulate with a total land area of 11893 km2 and a total irrigated area by yellow river diversion nearly 6667 km2 hetao irrigation district has an arid to semiarid continental climate with annual average temperature precipitation and pan evaporation 20 cm pan values of 7 7 162 mm and 2277 mm in the period 1957 2001 respectively it mainly draws water from the yellow river for irrigation consuming about 4 8 billion m3 103 600 irrigation and drainage channels of seven levels with a total length of 64 000 km in hetao irrigation district have been built to meet the irrigation needs sun et al 2017 the general central canal is a major artery for yellow river irrigation diversion in hetao irrigated area located at the southern margin of hetao plain the general central canal is connected to 14 main canals nine sub main canals and two branch canals in total thus the operation schedule of this canal significantly impacts the canal system s water use efficiency in the irrigated area for convenience in application the main sub main and branch canals are generalized into seven main canals based on their sub irrigated area and the diversion outlet location the simplified canal system is shown in fig 5 and its relative information is tabulated in table 1 accordingly the present study investigates the optimization scheduling problem of a two level irrigation canal system composed of the general central canal and seven main canals 3 1 2 canal scheduling practice the discharge process and conveyance loss rate of the general central canal from 2002 to 2009 are demonstrated in fig 6 the historical data of the hetao irrigation district shows different water delivery patterns which gave rise to the variation in water conveyance progress from year to year for example in 2009 the discharge increased rapidly at the canal opening stage until it reached a relatively high value conversely in 2003 the discharge had a low value at the canal opening stage followed by a shut down this interannual pattern difference is mainly due to some factors such as the crop planting structure meteorological conditions and water diversion of channels in different years likewise the canal s discharge loss rate per length varied each year due to different water conveyance patterns in 2009 the discharge loss rate decreased rapidly after the canal was opened then slightly increased and reached 0 0017 on april 21st in 2003 the discharge loss rate oscillated at a high during the opening period even two months after opening the discharge loss rate was still high when on may 31st was equivalent to 0 008 the described discharge loss rate variation in different years gives rise to the variation in canal water use efficiency as shown in fig 6 c the canal water utilization efficiency of the general central canal had its lowest and highest values in 2003 and 2009 respectively as curves i and ii in fig 6 b demonstrate the discharge loss rate has a high initial value then rapidly decreases and by advancing in scheduling time approaches a stable value in addition the historical data suggests that the discharge loss rate does not uniquely correspond to the canal discharge described in the empirical formula the marked points in fig 6 b i e a b c and d indicate that a unique discharge value could have a different discharge loss rate at different canal scheduling times 3 2 simulation performance of water conveyance loss models the observed data during the canal scheduling period including the discharge data series of the four sluice gates on the general central canal and the discharge data series of the main canals sub main canals and branch canals connected to the general central canal are utilized for calibrating from 2002 to 2006 and validating from 2007 to 2009 influential parameters of water conveyance loss models i e dmwcl k vs and vt the results for all models in terms of r 2 n s e v e and e are illustrated and compared in table 2 moreover table 3 shows the calibration results of these models in the general central canal according to table 3 concerning all the employed criteria generally it can be stated that the dmwcl model has the best simulation performance with the average n s e r 2 v e and e values are 0 793 0 799 2 963 and 0 767 in calibration and 0 657 0 680 6 075 and 0 608 in validation respectively the results imply that considering the temporal and spatial variability of channel water transport loss in the dmwcl model improves the simulation accuracy compared to other models due to accounting for temporal variability the average n s e r 2 and e values in dmwcl are 20 16 20 97 and 18 16 higher in calibration and 19 95 16 69 and 30 25 higher in validation than those of the vs model respectively likewise considering the spatial variability in dmwcl models resulted in 1 38 0 83 and 2 89 higher n s e r 2 and e values in calibration and 2 36 1 18 and 4 12 higher n s e r 2 and e values in validation than those of the vt model remarkably considering both the temporal and spatial variabilities of water conveyance loss in dmwcl models shows the most significant influence on improving the simulation performance in comparison with the k model dmwcl improved n s e r 2 and e by 20 42 21 11 and 21 40 in calibration and by 22 37 16 94 and 38 78 in validation respectively furthermore the dmwcl model improves simulation accuracy by reporting 3 79 1 25 and 6 06 lower v e than vs vt and k models in validation respectively confirming its absolute superiority over other models u1 u 4 four canal sections from the start to the end of the general central canal k regression coefficient w am soil water

and the penman monteith p m formula gao et al 2019 are employed to calculate the water demand processes according to the meteorological data crop planting data and empirical irrigation schedule in 2014 and 2016 subsequently this information is used for canal scheduling of the summer irrigation period through k cs vs cs vt cs and dmwcl cs models fig 7 a and a illustrates the water demand processes of the general central canal and seven main canals in addition referring to the flow records of the shizuishan hydrological station located in the upper reaches of the hetao irrigation district the available water process of the irrigation district in 2014 and 2016 is formulated and visualized in fig 7 b and b 4 result in this section we applied the k cs model vs cs model vt cs model and dmwcl cs model in two canal scheduling scenarios and compared the scheduling process and water delivery loss of the four models in the summer irrigation period 4 1 comparisons of overall water delivery performance between the four models to evaluate the models performance their water delivery performance for the general central canal and its seven main canals during two summer irrigation periods in 2014 and 2016 are compared the total water diversion volume at the start of the general central canal in 2014 and 2016 were 1814 40 and 1598 41 million m3 respectively the total water demand volume of the seven main canals was 1555 92 and 1347 36 million m3 in 2014 and 2016 respectively table 4 present the summary statistics for the water conveyance loss and water shortage in 2014 and 2016 according to table 4 the dmwcl cs model outperforms the other models in reducing water conveyance loss under the same water consumption during the two summer irrigation compared with the outcomes of the k cs vs cs and vt cs models in 2014 the dmwcl cs model reduced the water conveyance loss by 10 60 8 05 and 2 49 million m3 respectively this reduction in 2016 could be accounted for 6 17 4 21 and 0 60 million m3 compared to the k cs vs cs and vt cs models respectively table 4 implies fewer water shortages in the dmwcl cs model than in the other models the water shortage derived from the dmwcl cs model compared to the k cs vs cs and vt cs models decreased by 36 53 21 23 and 9 10 million m3 in 2014 this comparison in 2016 shows that water shortage derived from the dmwcl cs is 46 80 31 16 and 11 43 million m3 less than the k cs vs cs and vt cs models respectively 4 2 comparisons of water delivery patterns between the four models to capture the spatial and temporal characteristics of the water delivery patterns derived from the developed models the schedules of the general central canal and its seven main canals during summer irrigation periods in 2014 and 2016 are compared these comparison results are illustrated in fig 8 fig b1 and fig b2 the average values of discharge nawci of the canal bed soil and discharge loss rate at the opening stage for the subsections u1 u2 u3 and u4 through each model in 2014 and 2016 are tabulated in table 5 fig 8 shows that considering both temporal and spatial variability of water conveyance loss in the dmwcl cs model results in the largest water delivery discharge at the opening stage noticeably the average water delivery discharge values table 5 of the general central canal derived by the dmwcl cs model are 193 37 m3 s in 2014 18 50 41 53 and 49 31 higher than vt cs vs cs and k cs models respectively similarly in 2016 the dmwcl cs model provides 19 57 55 17 and 110 25 higher water delivery discharge than vt cs vs cs and k cs models respectively the discharge process of the seven main canals under the four scheduling modes in fig b1 and fig b2 also demonstrates that dmwcl cs provides higher water delivery discharge at d1 to d7 at the opening stage after the canal opening stage water delivery discharge values derived by the dmwcl cs model are smaller than those of other models in order to analyze the impact of the calculated water delivery pattern through each model on the general central canal s bed soil the variation of normalized antecedent water conveyance index nawci per each model during the summer irrigation periods is illustrated in fig 9 and compared with each other according to fig 9 the bed soil becomes saturated over the canal scheduling time and nawci derived by all models gradually increases investigating the visualized information in fig 9 reveals considerable differences between nawci values corresponding to each model at the canal opening stage the average nawci values table 5 of the canal bed soil for the canal sections u1 to u4 derived by the dmwcl cs model in 2014 are 3 08 15 79 4 69 37 50 and 19 64 46 67 larger than vt cs vs cs and k cs models respectively similarly in 2016 the dmwcl cs model provides 5 56 18 00 18 30 51 28 and 46 15 118 52 larger nawci values than vt cs vs cs and k cs models respectively furthermore the average nawci values derived by the vt cs and vs cs models are larger than the k cs models after the canal opening stage the canal bed soil reaches a wet state and nawci values derived from the four models have little difference these results confirm that considering the temporal and spatial variability of canal water conveyance loss speeds up the wetting process of canal bed soil in all subsections while the wetting process of canal bed soil is more rapid through the dmwcl cs model 4 3 comparisons of water conveyance loss between the four models 4 3 1 the temporal variability of water conveyance loss over the scheduling time in this section the temporal characteristics of the water conveyance loss derived by all models are compared to find differences in water conveyance loss over canal scheduling time fig 10 illustrates the variation of the percent loss per kilometer in subsections u1 u4 an initial visual investigation reveals that the percent loss per kilometer at the opening stage derived by all models is very high but it decreases nonlinearly over the scheduling time the visualized information in each subsection also reveals the significant differences between the derived percent loss per kilometer values at the opening stage the average values of percent loss per kilometer table 5 for the canal sections u1 to u4 derived by the dmwcl cs model in 2014 are 6 02 20 91 6 47 21 70 and 11 36 29 30 smaller than vt cs vs cs and k cs models respectively this comparison in 2016 shows that the dmwcl cs model decreases percent loss per kilometer values by 1 49 13 16 4 34 25 51 and 8 64 44 63 compared with vt cs vs cs and k cs models respectively in addition the average values of percent loss per kilometer derived by the vt cs and vs cs models are smaller than the k cs models after the gate opening stage the percent loss per kilometer derived by the four models reached a low level with little difference overall it can be seen that considering the temporal and spatial variability of canal water conveyance loss significantly reduces the percent loss per kilometer in all subsections particularly at the canal opening stage confirming that the dmwcl cs model has the most remarkable impact on reducing canal water conveyance loss 4 3 2 the spatial variability of water conveyance loss along the canal reach the spatial distribution characteristics of the water conveyance loss derived by all models are compared to find differences in water conveyance loss along the canal reach fig 11 shows the distribution of discharge loss along the canal reach when the canal bed soil of u1 to u4 was saturated i e may 16th in 2014 and 2016 fig 11 reveals that the models dmwcl and vs which consider the spatial variability of water conveyance loss report considerably different discharge loss than vt and k the discharge loss derived by the dmwcl and vs models decrease along the canal reach in contrast the discharge loss derived by the vt model and the k model remains a constant value i e equal to the discharge loss at the end of the canal according to eq 9 the discharge loss changes correspondingly by decreasing the canal discharge along the canal reach fig 11 shows that the discharge loss values deduced without considering the spatial variability of canal water loss are smaller than that with this characteristic taken into account therefore it can be stated that the vt and k models underestimate the canal water conveyance loss to further analyze this underestimation error the relative errors between the dmwcl cs and k cs models under different canal bed soil permeability canal discharge and water delivery distance are compared and visualized in fig 12 this figure shows that the relative error between the two models increases by extending the water conveyance distance under the same canal bed soil permeability and canal discharge furthermore the relative error between the dmwcl cs and k cs models decreases with the increase of canal discharge at the same water permeability of canal bed soil and the water delivery distance in particular the relative errors within 100 km of water delivery distance are less than 10 when the canal discharge is greater than 100 m3 s fig 12 also implies that the permeability of canal bed soil influences the relative error in identical conditions the greater the permeability of canal bed soil the larger the relative error 5 discussion 5 1 influence of the temporal variability of canal water conveyance loss on canal scheduling the proposed results in section 4 2 indicate the superiority of the dmwcl cs over other models in capturing the temporal variability of canal water conveyance loss over the scheduling time which is due to its capability to optimize the canal water delivery schedule according to the soil moisture condition of the canal bed directly see fig 8 to fig 10 the infiltration rate is very high since the canal bed soil is dry at the canal opening stage the derived water delivery scheme with large discharge from the dmwcl cs model speeds up the soil wetting process and rapidly makes the water conveyance loss decline to a low level thus when the canal bed soil becomes saturated it is unnecessary to increase the discharge to reduce the water conveyance loss as it has already reached a stable value conversely the derived water delivery schemes with small discharges from the k cs model vs cs models at the canal opening stage result in long term low soil moisture and high water permeability of the canal bed soil which can cause a great deal of water conveyance loss these water delivery schemes may cause water shortage since they underestimate the canal water conveyance loss at the canal opening stage likewise these water delivery schemes lead to excessive irrigation since they overestimate the canal water conveyance loss when the canal bed soil reaches saturation the issues described above agree with the previous studies on the temporal variability of canal water conveyance loss over the scheduling time rohwer et al 2007 demonstrated that rotational scheduling has higher losses than continuous flow due to higher losses at the beginning and end of each flooding akbar et al 2013 found that water conveyance loss at the end of the irrigation season decreased by more than half compared with the beginning of the irrigation season during 270 days revealing the evident temporal variability of canal water conveyance loss similarly the measured results of canal water loss in the coleambally irrigation area by moavenshahidi et al 2015 2016 also showed that the water loss rate decreases with the scheduling time the canal water conveyance loss mainly caused by seepage still belongs to the category of soil infiltration which obeys the natural soil infiltration process law the soil infiltration rate was relatively large during the initial phase and gradually decreased with time until it stabilized liu et al 2011 yang et al 2020 it is caused by the increasing dominance of gravity driven flow over capillarity driven flow with an increased penetration depth of the infiltrating water from this point of view the temporal variability of canal water conveyance loss over the scheduling time can be attributed to the variation of soil moisture conditions in the canal bed yao et al 2012 confirmed that the initial moisture content in the soil profile is an essential factor influencing infiltration from canals and that a dry soil has a larger infiltration capacity 5 2 influence of the spatial variability of canal water conveyance loss on canal scheduling the relative error between the dmwcl cs model and the k cs model in section 4 3 indicates that the dmwcl cs model is more adaptable to the spatial variability of canal water conveyance loss the discharge decreases along the canal reach due to seepage and consequently the discharge loss also decreases along the canal reach and the dmwcl cs model considers this issue conversely the k cs model considers the discharge loss at the end of the canal as a constant value within the canal reach thus underestimating the water conveyance loss the influence of this underestimation error is related to canal discharge water conveyance distance and soil permeability of the canal bed hence the smaller the canal discharge the longer the water conveyance distance and the higher permeability of the canal bed soil give rise to the more significant relative error fig 12 underestimating the canal water conveyance loss leads to the water delivery discharge in canal scheduling being less than the actual demand which leads to artificial water shortages in the irrigation area therefore the canal scheduling plan derived from the k cs or vt cs model will cause more water shortage than the vs cs or dmwcl cs model table 4 moreover at the canal opening stage the underestimation error caused by not considering the spatial variability of canal water loss is significant because of the high permeability of canal bed soil and the relative small canal discharge fig 8 fig 9 and fig 12 the discharge derived by the dmwcl cs model and the vs cs model at this stage is larger than that of the vt cs model and k cs model respectively fig 8 fig b1 and fig b2 avoiding artificial water shortages caused by underestimating the water conveyance loss these results reveal that the vs cs and dmwcl cs models can optimize the canal water delivery schedule according to the spatial variability of canal water conveyance loss these results are also in line with the findings of the previous studies many studies demonstrated that the seepage loss is positively related to the canal discharge but the percent loss per kilometer is inversely related to the discharge bakry and awad 1997 kinzli et al 2010 mohammadi et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 khepar et al 2000 found that the canal discharge decreased along the canal from head to tail and the loss rate of canal discharge increased along the canal which led to the farmers in the lower reaches getting much less water per unit area than the farmers in the upper reaches to ensure the fairness of water distribution it needs to increase the farmer s irrigation time downstream similarly haile et al 2020 s research shows that soil moisture content at farm plots along the middle and tail sections of the main canal would even fall below the permanent wilting point due to large canal seepage losses the reduced canal water supply at the lower reaches significantly impacts farmers income and productivity which decrease with an increase in distance from the head of the irrigation canals the productivity of the tail reach farmers varies from one third to one half of their head reach counterparts latif 2007 the described issues indicate the importance of considering the spatial variability of water conveyance loss during the canal schedule this issue is more critical for canals with small water flow long water conveyance distance and high permeability of canal bed soil e g sandy soil men et al 2001 have improved the kostiakov formula considering the characteristics of canal discharge loss changing along the canal their research shows that the kostiakov formula is only applicable to calculating water conveyance loss in short canals with large flow but it will cause considerable errors in long canals with small flow for small scale canals decreased discharge along the canal reach results in large percent loss and crop water stress even worse in the channel composed of sandy soil derib et al 2011 shaikh and lee 2016 therefore it is important to optimize water delivery processes to make canals run close to designed discharges which reduces the underestimation error and water shortage caused by the spatial variability of canal water loss liu et al 2018 guo et al 2019 yao et al 2019 6 conclusion this paper proposes a dynamic calculation model of canal water conveyance loss dmwcl considering these various characteristics and further builds this model into the optimal irrigation scheduling system to form a new canal scheduling model dmwcl cs the dmwcl cs model performs better in reducing the water conveyance loss and water shortage compared with the k cs model the vs cs model and the vt cs model model simulations suggest that the improvement of the dmwcl cs model benefits from full use of the status information of canal flow and canal bed soil moisture leading to its better adaptability to the temporal and spatial variability of water conveyance loss the dmwcl cs model increases the canal discharge at the canal opening stage speeding up the wetting process of canal bed soil and reducing the initial values of the discharge loss rate per unit canal length in addition the dmwcl cs model increases the canal discharge to adapt to the characteristic that the discharge decreases at an increasing rate along the canal reach due to seepage especially in the small canal flow rate high soil permeability and long water delivery distance the results of this study highlight the importance of formulating irrigation canal schedules according to the temporal and spatial characteristics of canal water conveyance loss the models and findings derived from this study are expected to provide managers with an effective approach to formulate a canal water delivery schedule with improved irrigation efficiency and lower water shortage further studies need to be carried out to improve canal scheduling accuracy and efficiency firstly the optimal canal scheduling in this paper is also based on the long term prediction of the inflow and water demand of irrigation areas and the low accuracy of the long term inflow and water demand prediction is bound to affect the validity of the canal scheduling plan in a further study the short term forecast data will be used to make a rolling revision of the long term canal water delivery schedule clark and mccracken 2009 secondly the centralized decision making model is assumed in making the canal delivery schedule which does not conform to the existing management system framework of the irrigation district further studies intend to take the canal manager and water user as independent decision makers and establish a canal scheduling model that can reflect the hierarchical relationship between the leader and follower wang et al 2020 finally when considering the time variability of the canal water conveyance loss this paper focuses on the canal bed soil moisture ignoring the influence caused by the change in groundwater level the further study intends to take the canal water soil water groundwater as a system and analyze its change rule in canal

9252,the water conveyance loss of irrigation canals shows significant spatial temporal variability both along the canal reach and over time an accurate representation of these variances in irrigation canal scheduling is essential to reduce water conveyance loss however the existing optimal irrigation scheduling models oisms still have deficiencies in dealing with spatial temporal variability of water conveyance losses which seriously limits the model performance in many irrigation areas with high spatial temporal variability borrowing a concept from hydrology we propose a dynamic calculation method of canal water conveyance loss dmwcl in which antecedent water conveyance index awci is defined to represent the effects of antecedent soil water content upon infiltration losses and the integral flow balance method is adopted to describe the characteristics of canal discharge decreasing along the canal reach based on the dmwcl we present a novel canal scheduling model with the potential to adapt to spatial temporal variability dmwcl cs the new model is applied to the hetao irrigation district inner mongolia a typical agricultural watershed in china our results across the case studies show that the canal water delivery schedule derived by the dmwcl cs model reduces water conveyance loss and improves irrigation performance ranging from 2 49 million m3 to 10 60 million m3 in 2014 and from 0 60 million m3 to 6 17 million m3 in 2016 respectively compared to that of three additional models interestingly we find that the water delivery schedule of the dmwcl cs model accelerates the wetting process of the canal bed soil to reduce the water conveyance loss and increases the discharge to adapt to the characteristics that the discharge decreases along the canal reach the dmwcl cs model provides essential insights for irrigation managers to formulate a canal water delivery schedule that adapts to spatial temporal variability the proposed framework is generic and

severe water scarcity during at least one month of the year and this stress level will continue to increase as water demand grows united nations educational and organization 2019 agricultural irrigation accounts for 69 of the global water withdrawal dominating global water use unfortunately water use efficiency in this sector is abysmal by submitted global values mostly below 50 kilic and tuylu 2011 kulkarni and nagarajan 2019 thus agricultural water saving is of utmost importance for alleviating the water shortage crisis compared to other irrigation activities canal scheduling has more influence on the irrigation system s performance vaidyanathan 1992 canal scheduling directly affects the quality of irrigation service over irrigation would lead to spillage losses and even groundwater pollution and soil salinization conversely insufficient irrigation results in crop yield losses due to a deficit water supply kaur et al 2013 furthermore efficient canal scheduling could significantly reduce water conveyance loss guo et al 2019 liu et al 2018 peng et al 2012 water conveyance loss in canals accounts for 30 50 of the total volume of water transported in iran kulkarni and nagarajan 2019 these proportions are as high as 45 and 66 in india and pakistan respectively mohammadi et al 2019 in china the water use coefficient of the backbone canal system in large scale irrigation areas in 2015 was only 0 597 which means that more than 40 were lost during conveyance national development and reform commission 2017 accordingly canal conveyance loss significantly affects irrigation efficiency which magnifies the importance of reasonable irrigation scheduling strategies for improving the utilization efficiency of irrigation water the main task of canal scheduling is to reasonably determine the time and amount of water delivery in the irrigation area according to crop water demand and available irrigation water under the fixed physical characteristics of a canal system bhadra et al 2010 molden and gates 1990 notwithstanding canal irrigation scheduling is a multi level and multi objective problem the distribution of the canal system is hierarchical in practice and the requirements of decision makers may vary with each other delgoda et al 2017 guo et al 2019 prespecifying an accurate water demand and available water supply is challenging due to the multiplicities of uncertainties in canal scheduling peng et al 2019 wang et al 2015 the issues described above and the interactions among the physical social economic and organizational factors that uniquely affect each irrigation system make the canal scheduling a complex task mishra et al 2002 moreover water loss estimation from canals involves many complicated mechanisms that pose various difficulties for researchers and canal administrators canal seepage depends upon many factors including the hydraulic conductivity of canal bed soil channel geometry constraints on groundwater flow and hydraulic characteristics of the canal flow such as water depth flow velocity and length of the wetted perimeter akbar et al 2013 alam and bhutta 2004 shah et al 2020 swamee et al 2002 yussuff et al 1994 these factors vary along a canal reach and integrate over time contributing to ambiguity in assessing seepage losses martin and gates 2014 canal discharge is an important hydraulic parameter that affects canal conveyance efficiency bakry and awad 1997 kinzli et al 2010 mohammadi et al 2019 canal discharge gradually decreases along the canal reach due to seepage khepar et al 2000 resulting in the spatial variability of water conveyance loss in addition the water permeability of a canal bed highly depends on its soil moisture condition which is the crucial driving force for water infiltration into the soil furman et al 2006 the infiltration rate decreases nonlinearly as soil moisture increases and finally approaches a stable rate when the soil is saturated horton 1941 philip 1957 yang et al 2020 during canal scheduling the water content in the soil profile of the canal bed often changes due to periodic water filling and drying thus the canal water conveyance loss also shows the temporal variability owing to the change in soil moisture content moavenshahidi et al 2015 yao et al 2012 recent decades have witnessed the development of canal scheduling models this development includes the expansion of the research scope from a single hierarchical layer of the canal network to multiple hierarchical layers and then to the whole irrigation network from a water source to a field kanooni and monem 2014 wang et al 1995 wardlaw and bhaktikul 2004 meanwhile the objective functions increased from a single objective of a single stakeholder to multiple objectives of several stakeholders delgoda et al 2017 guo et al 2019 khepar et al 2000 from another perspective solution algorithms have been developed from linear programming to nonlinear programming and then to heuristic methods anwar and clarke 2001 benli and kodal 2003 pawde et al 2013 suryavanshi and reddy 1986 notwithstanding the spatial and temporal variability of water conveyance loss from canals has been neglected or simplified in the previous studies which often resulted in a plan far from the optimal canal schedule santhi and pundarikanthan 2000 some researchers use a discount method to estimate the water conveyance loss for example conveyance losses of 30 were assumed by wardlaw and bhaktikul 2004 to apply their canal scheduling model in the indira gandhi nahar pariyojana irrigation system in northwest india in a study on the canal scheduling model during the dry season of purnahara irrigation district in india mishra et al 2008 assume that water conveyance loss in the field channel and distributary can be calculated as 20 and 15 of the total water delivery respectively peng et al 2012 adopted 4 and 9 as the water loss rates of branch canals and the main canal to calculate the seepage losses in their canal scheduling research of the nanguan main canal system in gaoyou irrigation area china similarly conveyance efficiencies of minors and distributaries in the upper wardha irrigation system of india are assumed as 80 and 90 respectively pawde et al 2013 the discount method is simple and easy to use but it is too rough to calculate the canal conveyance loss accurately some researchers assume that the water seepage loss is proportional to the length of the canal and can be calculated by the product of a known loss factor and the water delivery distance delgoda et al 2017 gonçalves et al 2007 kaur et al 2013 however this method ignores the spatial variability of water conveyance loss along the canal reach caused by the change of canal discharge measurement methods have been used to quantify canal water conveyance loss of canal systems santhi and pundarikanthan 2000 measured canal losses through flow measurements and ponding method when they made the scheduling plan of rotation irrigation for the sathanur irrigation project in india similarly mangrio et al 2016 used an inflow outflow method to measure conveyance losses in applying their crop based irrigation operation model in the mirpurkhas subdivision pakistan these measuring methods are very accurate but are challenging to popularize as they cost a lot of time workforce and equipment moreover empirical equations such as the kostiakov equation were often used to estimate water conveyance loss in the scheduling model azargashb lord et al 2021 guo et al 2019 khepar et al 2000 liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 in such cases the hydraulic parameters of a specific cross section like the beginning or end of the canal are used to calculate the water conveyance loss of the whole canal when other influential parameters such as soil permeability and lining conditions are considered constants although such equations are convenient for applications they involve considerable simplification and cannot correctly show the development of seepage in space and time yao et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 salemi and sepaskhah 2001 and akkuzu 2012 revealed the considerable inaccuracy in moritz and davis wilson equations and found that estimated water conveyance losses are significantly lower than the measured values zhang et al 2017 found that the water conveyance losses estimated by the kostiakov equation are 2 5 10 times higher than the field observations shah et al 2020 proved that the moritz and kostiakov equations overestimated the seepage by 53 and 158 respectively furthermore they stated that the davis wilson equation overwhelmingly underestimated the seepage the primary deficiency of the above canal scheduling models is neglecting the temporal and spatial variability of water conveyance loss over the scheduling time and along the canal reach neglecting those characteristics would cause severe overestimation or underestimation of water conveyance loss resulting in an inefficient water delivery schedule therefore there is an urgent need to develop a canal scheduling model that can comprehensively consider the spatial temporal variability of water loss accordingly the ultimate objective of this study is to propose a novel model for finding an optimal canal water delivery schedule that adapts to the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of water conveyance loss to this end a dynamic calculation model of canal water conveyance loss dmwcl is proposed subsequently a novel canal optimal scheduling model dmwcl cs with the potential to adjust to spatial temporal variability is developed the novelty of this study is that the dmwcl cs model optimizes the canal scheduling according to the spatial temporal variability of water conveyance loss which can significantly improve the canal water use efficiency the dmwcl cs model offers a fresh perspective on the optimization of canal scheduling by considering the change in soil moisture condition of the canal bed over the scheduling time and the change of canal discharge along the canal reach the methods and findings of this study are expected to provide some valuable insights for improving canal scheduling the remainder part of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the dmwcl and dmwcl cs models while three additional models for comparison in the optimal scheduling of a two level backbone canal system are explained section 3 describes the study area and the calibration and validation of the dmwcl model section 4 presents the optimization results of the dmwcl cs model and evaluates it in comparison with other models section 5 discusses the comparative results and reveals the influence of the temporal and spatial variability of the water conveyance loss on irrigation canal schedule and eventually section 6 summarizes the key conclusions and prospects for the future research direction 2 methodology the present study establishes four canal scheduling models each consisting of an optimization module and a module for calculating canal water conveyance loss the optimization module generates a canal water delivery schedule and the calculation module estimates the canal water conveyance losses of a water delivery schedule in the calculation module of canal water conveyance loss we improve the kostiakov formula by considering the temporal variability and spatial variability of canal water conveyance loss referring to the concept of antecedent precipitation index in hydrology we defined the antecedent water conveyance index as a symbolic index of soil moisture condition in the canal bed we further established functional relationships between this index and the water permeability parameters of canal bed in the kostiakov formula thus forming the vt model that can describe the temporal variability of canal water conveyance loss on the other hand we integrate the kosgakov formula on the infinitesimal canal element to obtain the functional relationship between the canal discharge and the water conveyance distance we use this functional relationship and the flow balance method to calculate the canal water conveyance loss thus forming the vs model that describes the spatial variability of canal water conveyance loss furthermore combined with the above two improvements we have established the dmwcl model that describes both the temporal and spatial variability of canal water conveyance loss we integrate the k model the vt model the vs model and the dmwcl model into the canal optimization scheduling module forming four canal scheduling models the k cs model the vt cs model the vs cs model and the dmwcl cs model the framework of this study is shown in fig 1 2 1 general canal scheduling model fig 2 illustrates a schematic of the most common two level canal network the upper layer is the main canal consisting of m canal sections the lower layer has n branch canals connected with z irrigation sub areas in this study the proposed irrigation canal scheduling model aims to minimize the water conveyance loss of the superior canal and simultaneously minimize the crop water shortage in the lower irrigation sub area these objectives could be mathematically expressed through eq 1 as expressed in eq 2 the optimization model is subjected to capacity constraint water availability constraint water balance constraint non negative constraint and equity constraints to ensure the feasibility of the solution when the decision variables of the model are the discharges of each subordinate canal during the canal scheduling process 1 m i n i m i z e w s j 1 n t 1 t max w d j t q d j t δ t 0 m i n

the capacity constraint which means that the canals discharge shall not exceed their designed discharges at any time interval to ensure safety and stable operation eq 2b represents the water availability constraint the total diversion discharge the summation of net discharge and discharge loss of the upper canal u 1 at the beginning of the upper canal shall not exceed the inflow of the irrigation area eq 2c represents the water balance constraint denoting the equality of inflow and outflow at the water diversion nodes of the lower canals eq 2d is the non negative constraint guaranteeing the nonexistence of negative discharge during the calculation eq 2e denotes the equity constraint due to the possible differences between the inflow and water demand in the irrigation area water shortage may occur in the irrigation sub area of each subordinate canal hence to ensure water allocation equity the difference between maximum and minimum water shortages rate i e r max and r min should be kept within a reasonable range i e r eq 2f calculates the water shortages rate utilized in eq 2e eq 2g calculates the water conveyance loss along the canal through the four models i e k vs vt and dmwcl in fig 1 which are thoroughly explained in the following sections finally eq 2h calculates the connection coefficients used in eq 2c 2 2 water conveyance loss module the present study develops several new approaches for calculating canal water conveyance loss by improving the kostiakov empirical formula the dmwcl model considers the temporal and spatial variability of canal water conveyance loss the vs cs and vt cs models consider only spatial variability and temporal variability respectively 2 2 1 description of temporal variability of water conveyance loss over the scheduling time to characterize water conveyance loss variation over the scheduling time we propose the antecedent water conveyance index as a symbolic index of soil moisture in canal bed and associate it with soil permeability parameters to establish functional relationships the soil water content is a helpful index that accurately represents the soil moisture condition in the canal bed however due to the high cost of direct measurement and significant temporal and spatial variability in soil water content it is challenging to consider this factor in large scale water scheduling management of irrigated areas referring to the concepts of antecedent precipitation index api and normalized antecedent precipitation index napi in hydrology ali et al 2010 heggen 2001 zhao et al 2011 this paper proposes antecedent water conveyance index awci and normalized antecedent water conveyance index nawci as indirect indicators of the soil moisture condition in the canal bed mathematically awci and nawci could be defined as follows see appendix a for the derivation process 3 a w c i t k a w c i t 1 v t 1 a w c i t a w c i max 4 n a w c i t a w c i t a w c i max the k in eq 3 is a parameter affected by the soil properties and climatic conditions reflecting the decay rate of soil water content in the canal bed due to infiltration and evaporation a w c i max is affected by the soil properties and canal water delivery capacity note that canal water delivery affects the soil s water storage capacity in the area surrounding the canal due to the variation of these two parameters in different soil types they should be calibrated through experimental observations when eq 3 is used to calculate a w c i the initial value of a w c i can be taken as zero after the canal has stopped water delivery for a long time or a w c i max after the canal has been running continuously with large discharge for a long time 2 2 2 description of spatial variability of water conveyance loss along the canal reach to describe water conveyance loss variation along the canal reach we use the integral method to obtain the functional relationship between canal discharge and cross section position and then calculate water conveyance loss by the water balance equation as depicted in fig 3 q 0 denotes the discharge at the start of the canal reach at two water delivery distances like x and x d x the discharges corresponding to these distances could be denoted by q x and q x dx respectively within the water delivery distance d x the discharge loss can be calculated as follows 5 d q q x d x q x f q d x the discharge q x can be obtained by taking the integral of eq 5 from the start of the canal reach to the cross section at the location x accordingly with respect to the water discharge balance relationship the discharge loss from the start of the canal reach to location x can be expressed as 6 δ q x q 0 q x q 0 0 x f q d x 2 2 3 proposed model for calculation water conveyance loss over the scheduling time and along the canal reach taking into account that eqs 3 and 4 describe the dynamic change process of soil moisture condition in the canal bed over scheduling time and eqs 5 and 6 reflect the spatial variability of water conveyance loss along the canal reach in order to consider both temporal and spatial variability of water conveyance loss the present study proposes a comprehensive and straightforward dynamic model which is formed by combining eqs 3 6 with several prevalent empirical formulas for calculating the water conveyance loss for instance the prototype of the well known kostiakov formula for calculating discharge loss is described as follows 7 σ a 100 q m a 0 0 m 1 to reflect the characteristics of canal discharge decreasing along the way f q in eq 7 can be expressed in the following form 8 f q σ q then according to eqs 5 and 6 the calculation method of canal water conveyance loss considering its spatial variability vs model can be proposed as follows see appendix a for the derivation process 9 q x q 0 m 0 01 a m x 1 m 10 δ q x q 0 q 0 m 0 01 a m x 1 m 11 δ q x q l m 0 01 a m x 1 m q l in eq 7 parameters a and m only depend on the soil type and do vary over time cai et al 2013 suggested that the soil permeability coefficient and index are functions of soil water content therefore this paper considers a and m in eq 7 as a function of normalized antecedent water conveyance index as follows 12 a a n a w c i 13 m m n a w c i by substituting eq 12 and eq 13 into eq 7 the calculation method of canal water conveyance loss considering its temporal variability vt model can be proposed as follows 14 δ q x σ q x 0 01 a n a w c i q 1 m n a w c i x by substituting eq 12 and eq 13 into eq 10 and eq 11 the dynamic calculation model of canal water conveyance loss dmwcl can be proposed as follows 15 δ q x q 0 q 0 m n a w c i 0 01 a n a w c i m n a w c i x 1 m n a w c i 16 δ q x q l m n a w c i 0 01 a n a w c i m n a w c i x 1 m n a w c i q l different functions such as the linear furman et al 2006 power van genuchten 1980 and exponential philip 1986 have been proposed for calculating eq 12 and eq 13 for simplicity in application the present study adopts two linear functions however if desired the same approach could be used for more sophisticated forms these linear functions can be expressed as follows 17 a n a w c i a n a w c i b 18 m n a w c i c n a w c i d where a b c and d are constants these values need to be calibrated 2 2 4 water conveyance loss model calibration the parameters k a w c i max a b c and d in the dmwcl and vt model and a m in the vs and k model must be calibrated upon the measured data on canal water delivery through the inflow outflow method kulkarni and nagarajan 2019 the measured historical flow of canal scheduling is utilized to calculate the canal conveyance loss in each period as shown in eq 19 the seepage in the reach is obtained by a water balance equation in which all the inputs except for seepage are known subsequently the four models for water conveyance loss calculation are used to simulate the water conveyance loss during the canal scheduling period by minimizing the difference between the outcomes of the inflow outflow method and model simulation through pso sadoghi yazdi et al 2012 the optimal values of the above parameters have been determined it is noteworthy that the pso has 120 particles and is executed for 300 iterations 19 q l o s s q i n q o u t q i n t q d i v three statistical criteria including nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient n s e coefficient of determination r 2 and volume error v e are used to assess the simulation performance of the four models for water conveyance loss calculation these statistical criteria could be calculated as follows 20 n s e 1 i t 1 n o i t s i t 2 i t 1 n o i t o a v e 2 21 r 2 i t 1 n o i t o a v e s i t s a v e 2 it 1 n o i t o a v e 2 it 1 n s i t s a v e 2 22 v e s a v e o a v e o a v e 100 greater n s e and r 2 mean better simulation performance while the maximum possible value of these metrics is one conversely the optimal value of v e is zero thus a v e close to zero indicates better simulation performance following yang et al 2020 suggestion these three criteria could be aggregated into the objective function termed e used in pso algorithm as follows 23 e n s e r 2 2 v e e could take a value between 1 and minus infinite while its optimal value equals 1 2 3 the four canal scheduling models the four canal scheduling models including the k cs model the vt cs model the vs cs model and the dmwcl cs model are proposed by embedding the k model the vt model the vs model and the dmwcl model in the general canal scheduling model 2 3 1 k cs model the k cs model uses the kostiakov formula to calculate water conveyance loss so eq 2g can be expressed as follows 24 q u i t 0 01 a u i q u i t 1 m u i l u i 2 3 2 vt cs model the vt cs model uses the vt model to calculate water conveyance loss so eq 2g can be expressed as follows 25 q u i t 0 01 a u i n a w c i u i t q 1 m u i n a w c i u i t l u i 2 3 3 vs cs model the vs cs model uses the vs model to calculate water conveyance loss so eq 2g can be expressed as follows 26 q u i t q u i t m u i 0 01 a u i m u i l u i 1 m u i q u i t 2 3 4 dmwcl cs model the dmwcl cs model utilizes the dmwcl model to calculate the water conveyance loss of each canal water delivery schedule so eq 2g can be expressed as follows 27 q u i t q u i t m n a w c i t 0 01 a n a w c i t l u i 1 m n a w c i t q u i t 2 3 5 canal scheduling model solution the optimization problem in dmwcl cs and comparative models are multi objectives nonconvex and nonlinear to solve these problems the dual objective problem is transformed into a single objective problem by assigning weights to two objectives furthermore the multi constraints problem is transformed into an unconstrained problem through the penalty function method finally a modified pso is employed to solve the eventuated single objective unconstrained problem 2 3 5 1 solution of dual objective problem this study develops a two level irrigation network in which the amount of water conveyance loss of the superior canal and the amount of the crop water shortage in the lower irrigation sub area are the upper and lower canal manager objectives that need to be minimized the two objectives are usually cooperative as they require enough water to be delivered to the irrigation subarea nevertheless the cost of delivering water could be greater than the benefit when a tremendous amount of water is lost due to the superior canal s conveyance loss in this case the two objectives are competitive however it is impractical to stop delivering water to an irrigation area only due to the enormous water conveyance loss in the superior canal thus it can be concluded that the two objectives in the models are mostly cooperative accordingly the weighting method can be adopted to covert the dual objective problem into a single objective problem the present study assumes that the two objectives have the same prominence and considers an equal weight for both objectives i e 0 5 2 3 5 2 constraint processing the multiplicity of the described constraints in eq 2 gives rise to the complexity of the optimization procedure the penalty function approach is employed to reflect these constraints in the fitness function to facilitate the optimization procedure suppose a solution violates a constraint in that case the solution will be penalized and its fitness value multiplied by a penalty factor furthermore when a solution submits a higher violation the value of the penalty factor increases correspondingly consequently the algorithm automatically converges from the infeasible domain to the feasible domain according to the conducted analysis of the constraints in eq 2 their corresponding penalty functions are designed as follows 28 p c u 1 i 1 m t 1 t max q i t u q i t u q i u s 0 q i u s 29 p c d 1 j 1 n t 1 t max q j t d q j d s 0 q j d s 30 p w a 1 t 1 t max q 1 t u q 1 t u q t u max 0 q t u max 31 p e 1 max r max r min r 0 r 32 p n 1 j

the globally optimal solution of the four models i e dmwcl cs k cs vs cs and vt cs the present study employs the parallel swarm shuffling evolution algorithm based on particle swarm optimization psse pso jiang et al 2007 the psse pso is a stable global optimization algorithm with high computational efficiency which overcomes the shortcoming of the classical particle swarm optimization algorithm in falling into local optimums in the early stage the psse pso was inspired by the idea of competitive evolution and sub population mixing which begins with randomly generating an initial population and dividing it into multiple sub populations each subpopulation evolves according to the classical pso based on its evolution strategy after a certain number of iterations psse pso exchanges the information by mixing the subpopulations into a population afterward the whole population is divided into multiple subpopulations and the exact process is repeated until the stop criteria of the algorithm are satisfied fig 4 illustrates the flowchart for solving four developed canal scheduling models with the psse pso 3 case study the developed canal scheduling models including k cs vs cs vt cs and dmwcl cs are applied to the hetao irrigation district which is exposed to the water shortage risk due to low precipitation and high evaporation agriculture in hetao irrigation district is highly dependent on irrigation and an abundance of irrigation canals divert water from the yellow river to this area however poor canal scheduling often leads to considerable canal water conveyance losses in hetao irrigation district sun et al 2016 hence improving irrigation water use efficiency by optimal canal scheduling and reducing canal water conveyance loss in this area is essential the summer irrigation period in 2016 a year with water shortages and 2014 a year with sufficient water are selected for optimal canal scheduling through the developed models the summer irrigation period from april 1st to june 29th is divided into 18 time intervals containing five days 3 1 study area 3 1 1 general situation of hetao irrigation district hetao irrigation district is located in inner mongolia autonomous region between 106 20 109 19 e and 40 19 41 18 n it is one of the super large irrigation districts in china and the largest gravity diversion irrigation area in asia from west to east the hetao irrigation district is divided into five sub irrigated areas wulanbuhe jiefangzha yongji yichang and wulate with a total land area of 11893 km2 and a total irrigated area by yellow river diversion nearly 6667 km2 hetao irrigation district has an arid to semiarid continental climate with annual average temperature precipitation and pan evaporation 20 cm pan values of 7 7 162 mm and 2277 mm in the period 1957 2001 respectively it mainly draws water from the yellow river for irrigation consuming about 4 8 billion m3 103 600 irrigation and drainage channels of seven levels with a total length of 64 000 km in hetao irrigation district have been built to meet the irrigation needs sun et al 2017 the general central canal is a major artery for yellow river irrigation diversion in hetao irrigated area located at the southern margin of hetao plain the general central canal is connected to 14 main canals nine sub main canals and two branch canals in total thus the operation schedule of this canal significantly impacts the canal system s water use efficiency in the irrigated area for convenience in application the main sub main and branch canals are generalized into seven main canals based on their sub irrigated area and the diversion outlet location the simplified canal system is shown in fig 5 and its relative information is tabulated in table 1 accordingly the present study investigates the optimization scheduling problem of a two level irrigation canal system composed of the general central canal and seven main canals 3 1 2 canal scheduling practice the discharge process and conveyance loss rate of the general central canal from 2002 to 2009 are demonstrated in fig 6 the historical data of the hetao irrigation district shows different water delivery patterns which gave rise to the variation in water conveyance progress from year to year for example in 2009 the discharge increased rapidly at the canal opening stage until it reached a relatively high value conversely in 2003 the discharge had a low value at the canal opening stage followed by a shut down this interannual pattern difference is mainly due to some factors such as the crop planting structure meteorological conditions and water diversion of channels in different years likewise the canal s discharge loss rate per length varied each year due to different water conveyance patterns in 2009 the discharge loss rate decreased rapidly after the canal was opened then slightly increased and reached 0 0017 on april 21st in 2003 the discharge loss rate oscillated at a high during the opening period even two months after opening the discharge loss rate was still high when on may 31st was equivalent to 0 008 the described discharge loss rate variation in different years gives rise to the variation in canal water use efficiency as shown in fig 6 c the canal water utilization efficiency of the general central canal had its lowest and highest values in 2003 and 2009 respectively as curves i and ii in fig 6 b demonstrate the discharge loss rate has a high initial value then rapidly decreases and by advancing in scheduling time approaches a stable value in addition the historical data suggests that the discharge loss rate does not uniquely correspond to the canal discharge described in the empirical formula the marked points in fig 6 b i e a b c and d indicate that a unique discharge value could have a different discharge loss rate at different canal scheduling times 3 2 simulation performance of water conveyance loss models the observed data during the canal scheduling period including the discharge data series of the four sluice gates on the general central canal and the discharge data series of the main canals sub main canals and branch canals connected to the general central canal are utilized for calibrating from 2002 to 2006 and validating from 2007 to 2009 influential parameters of water conveyance loss models i e dmwcl k vs and vt the results for all models in terms of r 2 n s e v e and e are illustrated and compared in table 2 moreover table 3 shows the calibration results of these models in the general central canal according to table 3 concerning all the employed criteria generally it can be stated that the dmwcl model has the best simulation performance with the average n s e r 2 v e and e values are 0 793 0 799 2 963 and 0 767 in calibration and 0 657 0 680 6 075 and 0 608 in validation respectively the results imply that considering the temporal and spatial variability of channel water transport loss in the dmwcl model improves the simulation accuracy compared to other models due to accounting for temporal variability the average n s e r 2 and e values in dmwcl are 20 16 20 97 and 18 16 higher in calibration and 19 95 16 69 and 30 25 higher in validation than those of the vs model respectively likewise considering the spatial variability in dmwcl models resulted in 1 38 0 83 and 2 89 higher n s e r 2 and e values in calibration and 2 36 1 18 and 4 12 higher n s e r 2 and e values in validation than those of the vt model remarkably considering both the temporal and spatial variabilities of water conveyance loss in dmwcl models shows the most significant influence on improving the simulation performance in comparison with the k model dmwcl improved n s e r 2 and e by 20 42 21 11 and 21 40 in calibration and by 22 37 16 94 and 38 78 in validation respectively furthermore the dmwcl model improves simulation accuracy by reporting 3 79 1 25 and 6 06 lower v e than vs vt and k models in validation respectively confirming its absolute superiority over other models u1 u 4 four canal sections from the start to the end of the general central canal k regression coefficient w am soil water

2014 and 2016 subsequently this information is used for canal scheduling of the summer irrigation period through k cs vs cs vt cs and dmwcl cs models fig 7 a and a illustrates the water demand processes of the general central canal and seven main canals in addition referring to the flow records of the shizuishan hydrological station located in the upper reaches of the hetao irrigation district the available water process of the irrigation district in 2014 and 2016 is formulated and visualized in fig 7 b and b 4 result in this section we applied the k cs model vs cs model vt cs model and dmwcl cs model in two canal scheduling scenarios and compared the scheduling process and water delivery loss of the four models in the summer irrigation period 4 1 comparisons of overall water delivery performance between the four models to evaluate the models performance their water delivery performance for the general central canal and its seven main canals during two summer irrigation periods in 2014 and 2016 are compared the total water diversion volume at the start of the general central canal in 2014 and 2016 were 1814 40 and 1598 41 million m3 respectively the total water demand volume of the seven main canals was 1555 92 and 1347 36 million m3 in 2014 and 2016 respectively table 4 present the summary statistics for the water conveyance loss and water shortage in 2014 and 2016 according to table 4 the dmwcl cs model outperforms the other models in reducing water conveyance loss under the same water consumption during the two summer irrigation compared with the outcomes of the k cs vs cs and vt cs models in 2014 the dmwcl cs model reduced the water conveyance loss by 10 60 8 05 and 2 49 million m3 respectively this reduction in 2016 could be accounted for 6 17 4 21 and 0 60 million m3 compared to the k cs vs cs and vt cs models respectively table 4 implies fewer water shortages in the dmwcl cs model than in the other models the water shortage derived from the dmwcl cs model compared to the k cs vs cs and vt cs models decreased by 36 53 21 23 and 9 10 million m3 in 2014 this comparison in 2016 shows that water shortage derived from the dmwcl cs is 46 80 31 16 and 11 43 million m3 less than the k cs vs cs and vt cs models respectively 4 2 comparisons of water delivery patterns between the four models to capture the spatial and temporal characteristics of the water delivery patterns derived from the developed models the schedules of the general central canal and its seven main canals during summer irrigation periods in 2014 and 2016 are compared these comparison results are illustrated in fig 8 fig b1 and fig b2 the average values of discharge nawci of the canal bed soil and discharge loss rate at the opening stage for the subsections u1 u2 u3 and u4 through each model in 2014 and 2016 are tabulated in table 5 fig 8 shows that considering both temporal and spatial variability of water conveyance loss in the dmwcl cs model results in the largest water delivery discharge at the opening stage noticeably the average water delivery discharge values table 5 of the general central canal derived by the dmwcl cs model are 193 37 m3 s in 2014 18 50 41 53 and 49 31 higher than vt cs vs cs and k cs models respectively similarly in 2016 the dmwcl cs model provides 19 57 55 17 and 110 25 higher water delivery discharge than vt cs vs cs and k cs models respectively the discharge process of the seven main canals under the four scheduling modes in fig b1 and fig b2 also demonstrates that dmwcl cs provides higher water delivery discharge at d1 to d7 at the opening stage after the canal opening stage water delivery discharge values derived by the dmwcl cs model are smaller than those of other models in order to analyze the impact of the calculated water delivery pattern through each model on the general central canal s bed soil the variation of normalized antecedent water conveyance index nawci per each model during the summer irrigation periods is illustrated in fig 9 and compared with each other according to fig 9 the bed soil becomes saturated over the canal scheduling time and nawci derived by all models gradually increases investigating the visualized information in fig 9 reveals considerable differences between nawci values corresponding to each model at the canal opening stage the average nawci values table 5 of the canal bed soil for the canal sections u1 to u4 derived by the dmwcl cs model in 2014 are 3 08 15 79 4 69 37 50 and 19 64 46 67 larger than vt cs vs cs and k cs models respectively similarly in 2016 the dmwcl cs model provides 5 56 18 00 18 30 51 28 and 46 15 118 52 larger nawci values than vt cs vs cs and k cs models respectively furthermore the average nawci values derived by the vt cs and vs cs models are larger than the k cs models after the canal opening stage the canal bed soil reaches a wet state and nawci values derived from the four models have little difference these results confirm that considering the temporal and spatial variability of canal water conveyance loss speeds up the wetting process of canal bed soil in all subsections while the wetting process of canal bed soil is more rapid through the dmwcl cs model 4 3 comparisons of water conveyance loss between the four models 4 3 1 the temporal variability of water conveyance loss over the scheduling time in this section the temporal characteristics of the water conveyance loss derived by all models are compared to find differences in water conveyance loss over canal scheduling time fig 10 illustrates the variation of the percent loss per kilometer in subsections u1 u4 an initial visual investigation reveals that the percent loss per kilometer at the opening stage derived by all models is very high but it decreases nonlinearly over the scheduling time the visualized information in each subsection also reveals the significant differences between the derived percent loss per kilometer values at the opening stage the average values of percent loss per kilometer table 5 for the canal sections u1 to u4 derived by the dmwcl cs model in 2014 are 6 02 20 91 6 47 21 70 and 11 36 29 30 smaller than vt cs vs cs and k cs models respectively this comparison in 2016 shows that the dmwcl cs model decreases percent loss per kilometer values by 1 49 13 16 4 34 25 51 and 8 64 44 63 compared with vt cs vs cs and k cs models respectively in addition the average values of percent loss per kilometer derived by the vt cs and vs cs models are smaller than the k cs models after the gate opening stage the percent loss per kilometer derived by the four models reached a low level with little difference overall it can be seen that considering the temporal and spatial variability of canal water conveyance loss significantly reduces the percent loss per kilometer in all subsections particularly at the canal opening stage confirming that the dmwcl cs model has the most remarkable impact on reducing canal water conveyance loss 4 3 2 the spatial variability of water conveyance loss along the canal reach the spatial distribution characteristics of the water conveyance loss derived by all models are compared to find differences in water conveyance loss along the canal reach fig 11 shows the distribution of discharge loss along the canal reach when the canal bed soil of u1 to u4 was saturated i e may 16th in 2014 and 2016 fig 11 reveals that the models dmwcl and vs which consider the spatial variability of water conveyance loss report considerably different discharge loss than vt and k the discharge loss derived by the dmwcl and vs models decrease along the canal reach in contrast the discharge loss derived by the vt model and the k model remains a constant value i e equal to the discharge loss at the end of the canal according to eq 9 the discharge loss changes correspondingly by decreasing the canal discharge along the canal reach fig 11 shows that the discharge loss values deduced without considering the spatial variability of canal water loss are smaller than that with this characteristic taken into account therefore it can be stated that the vt and k models underestimate the canal water conveyance loss to further analyze this underestimation error the relative errors between the dmwcl cs and k cs models under different canal bed soil permeability canal discharge and water delivery distance are compared and visualized in fig 12 this figure shows that the relative error between the two models increases by extending the water conveyance distance under the same canal bed soil permeability and canal discharge furthermore the relative error between the dmwcl cs and k cs models decreases with the increase of canal discharge at the same water permeability of canal bed soil and the water delivery distance in particular the relative errors within 100 km of water delivery distance are less than 10 when the canal discharge is greater than 100 m3 s fig 12 also implies that the permeability of canal bed soil influences the relative error in identical conditions the greater the permeability of canal bed soil the larger the relative error 5 discussion 5 1 influence of the temporal variability of canal water conveyance loss on canal scheduling the proposed results in section 4 2 indicate the superiority of the dmwcl cs over other models in capturing the temporal variability of canal water conveyance loss over the scheduling time which is due to its capability to optimize the canal water delivery schedule according to the soil moisture condition of the canal bed directly see fig 8 to fig 10 the infiltration rate is very high since the canal bed soil is dry at the canal opening stage the derived water delivery scheme with large discharge from the dmwcl cs model speeds up the soil wetting process and rapidly makes the water conveyance loss decline to a low level thus when the canal bed soil becomes saturated it is unnecessary to increase the discharge to reduce the water conveyance loss as it has already reached a stable value conversely the derived water delivery schemes with small discharges from the k cs model vs cs models at the canal opening stage result in long term low soil moisture and high water permeability of the canal bed soil which can cause a great deal of water conveyance loss these water delivery schemes may cause water shortage since they underestimate the canal water conveyance loss at the canal opening stage likewise these water delivery schemes lead to excessive irrigation since they overestimate the canal water conveyance loss when the canal bed soil reaches saturation the issues described above agree with the previous studies on the temporal variability of canal water conveyance loss over the scheduling time rohwer et al 2007 demonstrated that rotational scheduling has higher losses than continuous flow due to higher losses at the beginning and end of each flooding akbar et al 2013 found that water conveyance loss at the end of the irrigation season decreased by more than half compared with the beginning of the irrigation season during 270 days revealing the evident temporal variability of canal water conveyance loss similarly the measured results of canal water loss in the coleambally irrigation area by moavenshahidi et al 2015 2016 also showed that the water loss rate decreases with the scheduling time the canal water conveyance loss mainly caused by seepage still belongs to the category of soil infiltration which obeys the natural soil infiltration process law the soil infiltration rate was relatively large during the initial phase and gradually decreased with time until it stabilized liu et al 2011 yang et al 2020 it is caused by the increasing dominance of gravity driven flow over capillarity driven flow with an increased penetration depth of the infiltrating water from this point of view the temporal variability of canal water conveyance loss over the scheduling time can be attributed to the variation of soil moisture conditions in the canal bed yao et al 2012 confirmed that the initial moisture content in the soil profile is an essential factor influencing infiltration from canals and that a dry soil has a larger infiltration capacity 5 2 influence of the spatial variability of canal water conveyance loss on canal scheduling the relative error between the dmwcl cs model and the k cs model in section 4 3 indicates that the dmwcl cs model is more adaptable to the spatial variability of canal water conveyance loss the discharge decreases along the canal reach due to seepage and consequently the discharge loss also decreases along the canal reach and the dmwcl cs model considers this issue conversely the k cs model considers the discharge loss at the end of the canal as a constant value within the canal reach thus underestimating the water conveyance loss the influence of this underestimation error is related to canal discharge water conveyance distance and soil permeability of the canal bed hence the smaller the canal discharge the longer the water conveyance distance and the higher permeability of the canal bed soil give rise to the more significant relative error fig 12 underestimating the canal water conveyance loss leads to the water delivery discharge in canal scheduling being less than the actual demand which leads to artificial water shortages in the irrigation area therefore the canal scheduling plan derived from the k cs or vt cs model will cause more water shortage than the vs cs or dmwcl cs model table 4 moreover at the canal opening stage the underestimation error caused by not considering the spatial variability of canal water loss is significant because of the high permeability of canal bed soil and the relative small canal discharge fig 8 fig 9 and fig 12 the discharge derived by the dmwcl cs model and the vs cs model at this stage is larger than that of the vt cs model and k cs model respectively fig 8 fig b1 and fig b2 avoiding artificial water shortages caused by underestimating the water conveyance loss these results reveal that the vs cs and dmwcl cs models can optimize the canal water delivery schedule according to the spatial variability of canal water conveyance loss these results are also in line with the findings of the previous studies many studies demonstrated that the seepage loss is positively related to the canal discharge but the percent loss per kilometer is inversely related to the discharge bakry and awad 1997 kinzli et al 2010 mohammadi et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 khepar et al 2000 found that the canal discharge decreased along the canal from head to tail and the loss rate of canal discharge increased along the canal which led to the farmers in the lower reaches getting much less water per unit area than the farmers in the upper reaches to ensure the fairness of water distribution it needs to increase the farmer s irrigation time downstream similarly haile et al 2020 s research shows that soil moisture content at farm plots along the middle and tail sections of the main canal would even fall below the permanent wilting point due to large canal seepage losses the reduced canal water supply at the lower reaches significantly impacts farmers income and productivity which decrease with an increase in distance from the head of the irrigation canals the productivity of the tail reach farmers varies from one third to one half of their head reach counterparts latif 2007 the described issues indicate the importance of considering the spatial variability of water conveyance loss during the canal schedule this issue is more critical for canals with small water flow long water conveyance distance and high permeability of canal bed soil e g sandy soil men et al 2001 have improved the kostiakov formula considering the characteristics of canal discharge loss changing along the canal their research shows that the kostiakov formula is only applicable to calculating water conveyance loss in short canals with large flow but it will cause considerable errors in long canals with small flow for small scale canals decreased discharge along the canal reach results in large percent loss and crop water stress even worse in the channel composed of sandy soil derib et al 2011 shaikh and lee 2016 therefore it is important to optimize water delivery processes to make canals run close to designed discharges which reduces the underestimation error and water shortage caused by the spatial variability of canal water loss liu et al 2018 guo et al 2019 yao et al 2019 6 conclusion this paper proposes a dynamic calculation model of canal water conveyance loss dmwcl considering these various characteristics and further builds this model into the optimal irrigation scheduling system to form a new canal scheduling model dmwcl cs the dmwcl cs model performs better in reducing the water conveyance loss and water shortage compared with the k cs model the vs cs model and the vt cs model model simulations suggest that the improvement of the dmwcl cs model benefits from full use of the status information of canal flow and canal bed soil moisture leading to its better adaptability to the temporal and spatial variability of water conveyance loss the dmwcl cs model increases the canal discharge at the canal opening stage speeding up the wetting process of canal bed soil and reducing the initial values of the discharge loss rate per unit canal length in addition the dmwcl cs model increases the canal discharge to adapt to the characteristic that the discharge decreases at an increasing rate along the canal reach due to seepage especially in the small canal flow rate high soil permeability and long water delivery distance the results of this study highlight the importance of formulating irrigation canal schedules according to the temporal and spatial characteristics of canal water conveyance loss the models and findings derived from this study are expected to provide managers with an effective approach to formulate a canal water delivery schedule with improved irrigation efficiency and lower water shortage further studies need to be carried out to improve canal scheduling accuracy and efficiency firstly the optimal canal scheduling in this paper is also based on the long term prediction of the inflow and water demand of irrigation areas and the low accuracy of the long term inflow and water demand prediction is bound to affect the validity of the canal scheduling plan in a further study the short term forecast data will be used to make a rolling revision of the long term canal water delivery schedule clark and mccracken 2009 secondly the centralized decision making model is assumed in making the canal delivery schedule which does not conform to the existing management system framework of the irrigation district further studies intend to take the canal manager and water user as independent decision makers and establish a canal scheduling model that can reflect the hierarchical relationship between the leader and follower wang et al 2020 finally when considering the time variability of the canal water conveyance loss this paper focuses on the canal bed soil moisture ignoring the influence caused by the change in groundwater level the further study intends to take the canal water soil water groundwater as a system and analyze its change rule in canal

9253,accurate estimations of reference evapotranspiration et0 are crucial for determining crop water requirements and designing an adequate irrigation scheduling to optimize the use of water in this work a new clustering method to outperform the accuracy of et0 estimations only using temperature variables has been developed and assessed based on the multifractal properties of the diurnal temperature range dtr thus a more accurate weather stations grouping method has been evaluated regardless of their geographic location all the datasets were collected from 89 automated weather stations in the period 2000 2018 and pooled into two main regions 1 and 2 in each region an iterative procedure has been carried out 1 selection of all the stations except the candidate one for the training procedure and 2 test procedure using the candidate station the results showed that machine learning models ml highly outperformed hargreaves samani hs in most of the cases being multilayer perceptron mlp the most accurate over extreme learning machine models elm on average the results obtained by mlp using the best configuration in the first region were better than those obtained in the second region specifically the first region got an root mean square error rmse 0 657 mm d nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 897 coefficient of determination r2 0 931 and mean bias error mbe 0 04 mm d

carried out the lowest rmse values this study provides a new and more accurate methodology to improve et0 estimations on a regional basis and only using temperature data in the whole process keywords bayesian optimization multilayer perceptron extreme learning machine multifractal characteristics regional model data availability i have shared the link of both the data and the code agroml 1 introduction reference evapotranspiration et0 quantifies the water needs of a reference surface not short of water only being affected by atmospheric conditions thereby accurate et0 calculations are crucial to optimizing water resources management and developing a more precise irrigation scheduling it is significantly impactful in semiarid and arid areas like andalusia southern spain where precipitation is generally scarce peña gallardo et al 2016 with very hot and dry summers and characterized by a structural water deficit estévez et al 2020 the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao recommends the physic based penman monteith formula pm et0 as the sole standard method for its computation allen et al 1998 however the number of required measured variables to compute pm et0 is very high air temperature t relative humidity rh wind speed u2 and solar radiation rs which is translated into the costly installation and maintenance of the automated weather stations aws besides they usually contain non reliable long term datasets due to miscalibration and lack of maintenance issues estévez et al 2016 2011 thus the geographical density of complete aws is generally low mainly in developing countries and rural areas estévez et al 2012 world meteorological organization 2018 in these terms several studies have analyzed new methodologies to determine et0 using a limited dataset such as the well known hargreaves samani equation hargreaves and samani 1985 it calculates et0 using the daily maximum tx and minimum air temperature tn as well as the extraterrestrial solar radiation ra which is calculated using the latitude of the site and the day of the year moreover machine learning ml and deep learning dl models have gained extraordinary attention for achieving state of art performance to compute et0 in different climatic and aridity conditions for example bellido jiménez et al 2020 analyzed the performance of multilayer perceptron mlp random forest rf support vector machine svm extreme learning machine elm generalized regression neural network grnn and extreme gradient boosting xgboost models using novel temperature based variables such as energyt and htx in different sites of andalusia south of spain despite no model significantly outperformed the rest elm and mlp usually gave the best results whereas grnn was significantly the worst in all cases and statistics besides the introduction of these novel variables improved the et0 estimations compared to only using tx tn and ra zhou et al 2020 evaluated deep

rh and u2 the use of anfis wcmfo a hybrid of both wca and mfo outperformed anfis wca and anfis mfo sattari et al 2021 evaluated gaussian process regression gpr broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno artificial neural network bfgs ann and long short term memory lstm to estimate monthly et0 using 10 different input features configurations derived from tm mean air temperature tx tn and rh u2and n in turkey bedi 2022 evaluated the concept of transfer learning using the knowledge acquired from one task to improve others to outperform et0 forecasts addressing the problem of low efficiency due to small training datasets two approaches were considered 1 training the models using datasets from the nearest cluster different from the target and eventually fine tuning at the target cluster 2 training the models using the nearest site to the target location within the same cluster and fine tuning using information from the target site besides support vector regression svr deep multilayer

mggp obtained the best results dimitriadou and nikolakopoulos 2021 estimated annual actual evapotranspiration et0 using empirical methods such as turc modified turc and coutagne and compared them to modis et for the period 2016 2019 in greece the results arised that turc could serve as an alternative to modis annual et despite the promising results of the aforementioned models most of the developed models were trained and tested using data from the same station local calibration which is impractical in real life applications except for gap filling consequently it is needed to build new regional models that can be deployed in new sites not used for calibration or for training the model in these terms gavilán et al 2006 evaluated a regional calibration based on the diurnal temperature range dtr and annual wind speed of hs equation using 88 aws in andalusia southern spain covering a diversity of climatic conditions from semi desert to subtropical coastal areas dai et al 2009 analyzed mlp and multi linear regression mlr to estimate monthly et0 in three different regions of mongolia according to its aridity index arid semi arid and sub humid climate their models were trained using data from multiple stations within the same subregion having similar climate conditions besides they tested using daily t rh u2 and n as inputs obtaining rmse 0 130 mm d 1 and r2 0 986 ramírez cuesta et al 2017 evaluated different approaches to estimate et0 at a regional scale using remote sensing and aws data they assessed two main approaches in order to calculate et0 using data from the closest station or the most similar weather station in andalusia their results arose that the use of the most similar aws resulted in an average error lower than 2 3 however their results were not homogeneous throughout the entire region having high differences between the lower section of the guadalquivir valley registering the smallest errors and the mountainous areas with abrupt changes in et0 values feng et al 2017 evaluated rf and grnn to estimate et0 in two locations with similar climate conditions in the sichuan basin southwest china they performed cross validation using data from both sites their results for the temperature based approaches using tx tn and ra were slightly more accurate in rf than in grnn but both models underestimated et0 since the actual values were greater at both stations ferreira and da cunha 2020a assessed rf mlp and convolutional neural networks cnn to estimate daily et0 in the state of minas gerais in brazil they firstly analyzed using hourly temperature and relative humidity data on a regional and local scenario the cnn approach exhibited the best results in all cases providing performance gains of up to 11 9 in terms of root mean squared error rmse and 7 8 in terms of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse regarding the regional scenario they used 43 aws with different climate conditions as training data while 10 stations representing the different climate variability from the training dataset were used as testing data trajkovic et al 2019 provided an adjustment of the thornthwaite equation for the vojvodina region serbia using data from 5 different aws and introducing data from three meteorological stations outside the study area this new approach cth gave accurate estimates generally being the best model in the site of timisoara fang et al 2018 evaluated partial mutual information pmi which captures the linear and nonlinear dependencies to forecast et0 using mlr svm and rf for 15 sites divided into two different regions the jing river basin and the beilvo river basin of china based on their results it could be stated that pmi presented a better performance for excluding redundant information than partial correlation based input selection pcis besides svm and rf could not always outperform the forecast of mlr models wu et al 2021 compared the results of kernel extreme learning machine kelm anfis and rf among others to estimate monthly et0 on a regional scale using data from 26 stations in china finally ferreira and da cunha 2020b evaluated different models rf mlp lstm cnn and lstm cnn to forecast daily et0 for up to a week in 53 weather stations in brazil following the procedure described in ferreira and da cunha 2020a generally according to the aforementioned literature several important methodological drawbacks need to be addressed in terms of developing training and deploying regional et0 models on the one hand due to the lack of open reliable meteorological datasets several authors have grouped aws data that belong to the same country or region geographical criteria and even places with no apparent geoclimatic relationship among them places from different countries latitudes and climatic conditions it has been stated by several authors the existence of different performances in et0 estimations according to the aridity index of the site obtaining better modelings in humid zones and worse results in more arid and semi arid locations paredes and pereira 2019 shiri et al 2014 thus developing a single model for sites with different geoclimatic conditions may arise in less efficient models on the other hand in order to deal with this issue a possible solution could be making regions from sites that have similar aridity index values despite this last approach being convenient to obtain accurate models the main problem is that it requires not only the same variables that pm et0 equation needs but also precipitation thus the development of robust and accurate regional models able to estimate et0 with limited availability datasets has not been addressed yet there is a great need to apply innovative approaches in non used sites training calibration with a very low budget but still having confident accuracy estimations thereby in this work a novel machine learning method has been assessed in order to outperform temperature based regional et0 estimations the stations grouping criterion is based on a multifractal characterization of the diurnal temperature range dtr following the work of herrera grimaldi et al 2019 where 197 aws from the spanish meteorological agency aemet that had similar multifractal behavior were grouped as the same cluster these geographical clusters were taken into account using new aws from a different aws network in andalusia the use of this multifractal characterization regionalization technique allows a more accurate stations grouping regardless of their geographical distribution only using daily temperature values for this purpose it is worth noting that no similar work has previously used a clustering method based on dtr multifractal properties to outperform et0 estimations in a regional scenario besides due to the promising results of mlp and elm for estimating and predicting et0 and solar radiation in this same region bellido jiménez et al 2022 2021 2020 outperforming the rest of the ml models significantly both models are assessed in this work thus the main objectives of this work are i the evaluation of a clustering procedure based on the multifractal characterization of dtr ii the assessment of mlp and elm models to estimate et0 only using temperature based features on a regional scenario iii the analysis of different input feature configurations for each region and iv the study the seasonal performance for each region 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of data and data management the study area is the region of andalusia which is located in southwest europe this region occupies a total area of 87 268 km2 and ranges from 1 to 7 ºw longitude and from 37 to 39ºn latitude it has a very heterogeneous climate from the mediterranean to the continental mountainous oceanic tropical and sub desert moreover the datasets used in this work belong to 89 aws from the agroclimatic information network of andalusia ria all these aws measure air temperature relative humidity of the air wind speed and direction at 2 m height solar radiation and precipitation the sensors specifications are shown in table 1 from april 2000 to july 2018 for a daily and sub daily every 30 min sampling rate they can be freely downloaded at https www juntadeandalucia es agriculturaypesca ifapa riaweb web accessed 8th march 2022 one of the key aspects for obtaining accurate modeling to estimate et0 on a regional basis is how we group the datasets of all the studied aws in this case two main regions were considered based on the previous work of herrera grimaldi et al 2019 where a multifractal characterization of dtr values was carried out for 258 aws from the spanish aemet meteorology statal agency and grouped them based on their multifractal characteristics in this work the authors studied the scaling of the statistical moments to detect the multifractal behavior using the scaling exponent function k q that satisfies eq 1 schertzer and lovejoy 1987 1 ε λ q λ k q where ε λ q corresponds to the average qth moment of the intensity of the process for a λ resolution the k q function becomes linear for q values higher than the critical qcritical which is defined as γ max eq 2 2 γ max max k q where γ is the order of singularity and γ max its maximum value de lima and de lima 2009 the γ max gives important information about the process analyzed lower values are related to extreme values whereas higher gamma values are characteristic of the smoothest processes for further information the following works can be revised garcía marín et al 2013 herrera grimaldi et al 2019 2018 the whole studied area was divided into two regions region 1 is composed of stations with low γ max γ max 0 07216 while region 2 includes those stations with γ max higher than 0 07216 fig 1 shows the spatial distribution of the aws and the considered regions and table 2 the characteristics of all the aws studied in this work as well as the geographical location of both regions in order to guarantee reliable results an essential prerequisite is the application of quality assurance tests where erroneous values are flagged and further evaluated the guidelines described by estévez et al 2011 2018 have been followed applying range tests regarding the specifications for each sensor as well as physical and climate extremes for each location and variable internal consistency tests based on physics and climatological consistency for each location and variable step tests based on time consistency persistence checking the variability of the measurements and spatial consistency designed to detect gross errors for observations tests to all meteorological data afterward the daily et0 was calculated using the pm et0 formula allen et al 1998 which was used as the target variable as well as the rest of the daily temperature based features bellido jiménez et al 2020 the maximum and minimum air temperature tx and tn respectively td tx tn the integral of the half hourly temperature values of a day energyt the time of day in hours when the tx and tn occur htx and htn respectively besides 70 different input configurations were previously assessed where the following variables were considered tx day 1 tx day tn day 1 tn day tn day 1 ra day td day htx day 1 htx day htn day 1 htn day energyt day 1 and energyt day however only the ten best configurations have been further discussed in this work see table 3 it is worth noting that tn day 1 was analyzed based on the work of bristow and campbell 1984 where they use tn day 1 to calculate tm average temperature in order to achieve the goals of this work the following control loop was followed 1 all the available datasets from ria were collected on daily and intradaily every half hour basis 2 several quality assurance tests range step internal consistency persistence and spatial consistency tests were applied following the procedures described in estévez et al 2016 2011 3 all the stations were grouped into two regions based on the multifractal characterization carried out by herrera grimaldi et al 2019 4 then to perform an exhaustive assessment in each region one ml model was developed for each aws a form of cross validation on a regional basis at each site the model was trained using the dataset from all aws in the region except for the candidate station while the dataset from the selected site was later used for testing purposes for example in the case of cor06 córdoba which is part of the first region the model to estimate et0 at this site was trained using the whole dataset of region 1 except the data from cor06 5 then for each aws in the region and in order to tune the different hyperparameters a hold out technique is used instead due to the enough size of the training dataset almost 400 000 registers for the first region and more than 100 000 registers for the second to avoid overfitting hossein kazemi et al 2020 shiri et al 2019 in these terms the bayesian optimization and validation dataset 30 of the training dataset were used 6 finally the final model was fully trained using the initial training dataset and assessed using the testing dataset the data from the candidate aws fig 2 shows a graphical summary of this methodology 2 2 reference evapotranspiration in this work the et0 values calculated using the pm et0 equation allen et al 1998 were used as the target values for the developed models it can be mathematically expressed as eq 3 3 pm et 0 0 408 rn g γ 900 t 273 u 2 es ea γ 1 0 34 u 2 where pm et0 is the reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 calculated using this equation 0 408 corresponds to a coefficient mj 1 m2 mm is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure versus temperature curve kpa c 1 rn is the net radiation calculated at the crop surface mj m 2 day 1 g is the soil heat flux density at the soil surface mj m 2 day 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 t is the mean daily air temperature c u2 is the mean daily wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 and es and ea are the saturation vapor pressure and the mean actual vapor pressure respectively kpa however it is not always possible to find aws collecting all the required parameters by pm et0 due to the expensive implementation and maintenance of these devices and the existence of missing and non reliable wind speed and solar radiation data is high estévez et al 2012 paola and giugni 2013 thus different temperature based approaches have been developed to handle this problem such as the hargreaves samani hs equation developed by hargreaves and samani 1985 as an empirical equation that only uses tx day tm day tn day and ra day to compute et0 eq 4 hs has been widely applied to different climates and countries luo et al 2014 shiri et al 2014 üneş et al 2020 yin et al 2020 4 hs et 0 0 0135 k tm 17 8 tx tn ra where hs et0 is the reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 calculated using hs equation and k is a coefficient 0 16 for inland and 0 19 for coastal locations additionally even though hs is the most common worldwide temperature based method there are other temperature based methodologies such as the thornthwaite equation thornthwaite and mather 1957 or the approximation from fao 56 allen et al 1998 2 3 machine learning models all the models were developed using the public repository from github agroml bellido jiménez et al 2022 which can be publicly accessed at https github com smarity agroml accessed march 16 2022 besides all the computations were carried out in a server workstation with the following characteristics 1 cpu amd ryzen threadripper pro 3955wx 16 cores 3 9 ghz 1 gpu nvidia rtx 3090 and 128 gb of ram based on the performance obtained in previous works bellido jiménez et al 2020 two kinds of models have been assessed multilayer perceptron mlp and extreme learning machine elm 2 3 1 multilayer perceptron the multilayer perceptron mlp is based on the neurons from the biological nervous systems which is one of the reasons for its high reputation besides it is characterized by easy coding and promising results within et0 estimations in most cases antonopoulos and antonopoulos 2017 ferreira et al 2019 ferreira and da cunha 2020a yassin et al 2016 they are structured into three different layers the input layer that represents the inputs of the model the hidden layer or layers where the neurons are located and the output layer that represents the outputs of the model et0 in this case for example for an mlp architecture with two inputs one single hidden layer containing three neurons and one output the structure is represented by fig 3 and eqs 5 6 7 and 8 5 x 1 1 f x 1 0 w 11 0 x 2 0 w 21 0 b 1 0 6 x 2 1 f x 1 0 w 12 0 x 2 0 w 22 0 b 2 0 7 x 3 1 f x 1 0 w 12 0 x 2 0 w 22 0 b 3 0 8 y 1 f x 1 1 w 11 1 x 2 1 w 21 1 x 3 1 w 31 1 b 1 1 where x 0 1 and x 0 2 represents the inputs of the model x 1 1 x 1 2 and x 1 3 represents the neurons of the hidden layer y1 the output itself and w represents the weights of each connection the weights of the model are automatically updated using a backpropagation algorithm during the training period 2 3 2 extreme learning machine extreme learning machine elm models are a novel approach guang bin et al 2004 composed of a single hidden layer feedforward neural network with much fewer computational requirements than mlps the main feature of this model is that the weights of the inputs are automatically generated while the weights of the outputs are analytically calculated thereby there is no need to carry out a backpropagation training process which makes these models have a very low computational cost and high demand for ram if the dataset is very large several works have assessed its use in et0 estimation and prediction worldwide kisi and alizamir 2018 wu et al 2021 2 4 bayesian optimization a critical aspect of obtaining accurate predictions in ml models is choosing a correct hyperparameter set depending on the chosen hyperparameters the performance could dramatically change from accurate to very poor results the hyperparameters of ml models modify their architecture and internal functional configuration for example the number of hidden layers the hidden neurons within each layer and the activation function among others in mlp one of the most common techniques to deal with hyperparameter selection is a trial and error technique where different values are evaluated and the best one is chosen however using this technique there is no assurance of the accurate performance of our model a more efficient approach is the use of bayesian optimization bo based on the bayes theorem and with high relation to human behavior when addressing this problem borji and itti 2013 shahriari et al 2016 because it takes into account the previous results to select the next set of hyperparameters to test even though there exist other algorithms that deal with hyperparameter tuning such as particle swarm optimization pso grey wolf optimizer gwo genetic algorithms ga whale optimization algorithm woa among others alizamir et al 2020 roy et al 2020 tikhamarine et al 2020 the popularity of bayesian optimization is very high in automated machine learning libraries like auto weka 2 0 kotthoff et al 2017 auto keras jin et al 2019 and auto sklearn feurer et al 2015 and they can be further consulted in hutter et al 2019 besides its popularity in et0 models is high alibabaei et al 2021 bateni et al 2021 the bayesian optimization can be explained using four steps 1 the hyperparameter space is set defining the limit values of all the hyperparameters 2 the algorithm asses several random values for all the hyperparameters 3 the algorithm set the next hyperparameter values to be evaluated taking into account the previous experience weighing up between exploitation choosing values known to have outstanding results or exploration choosing values with higher uncertainty behavior 4 if it has not finished yet it repeats step 3 in this work the bayesian optimization algorithm from agroml has been used which had been implemented using the scikit optimize library both models elm and mlp were configured to carry out 50 bayesian epochs 40 of them were randomly generated and the mean absolute error mae as the objective function table 4 shows the hyperparameter space of the models and figs 4 and 5 show the bo results from elm and mlp respectively 2 5 statistical analysis all the models were analyzed in order to evaluate their performance using the mbe the rmse the r2 nse and the global performance indicator gpi the mbe rmse r2 nse and gpi can be defined as eqs 9 10 11 12 and 13 respectively 9 mbe 1 n i 1 n x i y i 10 rmse 1 n i 1 n x i y i 2 11 r 2 i 1 n x i x y i y 2 i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 12 nse 1 i 1 n x i y i 2 i 1 n x i x 2 13 gpi j m 1 4 α m stat m stat mj where i represents each record n represents the number of records x represents the et0 values calculated using the fao56 pm formula y represents the estimations from models α is a coefficient being 1 for rmse and 1 for r2 and nse m represents each statistical performance indicator mbe rmse r2 and nse j defines a specific configuration statmj represents the performance indicator value normalized it is worth noting that instead of using the original mbe values their absolute values were calculated and the bar denotes the mean value besides in order to compare how ml models performed compared to hs the difference in the different statistics is shown as statbestml hs statbestml staths where stat represents any of the statistics mbe rmse r2 and nse 3 results and discussion to further evaluate the different results of this work all the graphs can be interactively revised as an html file in the additional files section 3 1 the evaluation of ml models in the different regions figs 6 and 7 show the rmse values for the best configuration at each site for regions 1 and 2 respectively generally both elm and mlp ml highly outperformed hs in most of the cases obtaining the highest improvement in jae08 úbeda rmsebestml hs 0 533 mm d and cad07 jimena de la frontera rmsebestml hs 0 410 mm d for regions 1 and 2 respectively the lowest rmse values were obtained in the stations hue09 la palma del condado rmsebestml 0 473 mm d for the first region and in mag01 málaga for the second rmsebestml 0 548 mm d on the one hand most of the sites got rmse values below 0 8 mm d for both regions even below 0 6 mm d for a high percentage of aws on the other hand very few locations jae102 villacarrillo alm06 virgen de fátima cuevas de almanzora and sev11 osuna obtained rmse values above 1 0 mm d using ml models besides only in 2 locations from the first region gra02 puebla de don fabrique and sev101 ifapa centro las torres tomejil finca tomejil the ml underperformed hs with an error of around 0 1 mm d it is also worth noting that in general the average ml performance in the first region was better than in the second rmsereg1 0 665 0 151 mm d and rmsereg2 0 712 0 113 mm d although in this last region mlp and elm significantly improve the results of hs rmsebestml hs 0 157 mm d and rmsebestml hs 0 212 mm d for region 1 and 2 respectively regarding the nse values figs 8 and 9 show the nse performances for the different models assessed in both regions 1 and 2 respectively the results are similar to those obtained by analyzing the rmse performance in most of the cases ml obtained an nse value above 0 9 the best values were obtained in jae11 mancha real nse 0 963 in the first region and cad04 villamartín nse 0 926 in the second region using mlp in both cases whereas the worst model was carried out in jae102 villacarrillo nsemlp 0 596 an nseelm 0 547 and nsehs 0 459 on the other hand there was only one site where hs outperformed ml models with a nse difference higher than 0 05 nsebestml hs 0 054 gra02 puebla de don fabrique moreover the average nse values carried out by ml models in both regions were very similar to one another nsereg1 0 894 0 064 and nsereg2 0 863 0 060 finally considering the performance difference between hs and ml models the mean outperformance in the second region was higher than in the second nsebestml hs 0 056 and nsebestml hs 0 091 for regions 1 and 2 respectively considering the r2 values figs 10 and 11 show the r2 values for the different models in the two assessed regions the best ml value in the first region was performed in jae05 torreblascopedro r2 0 966 using mlp whereas the worst was carried out in mag02 vélez málaga r2 0 835 in the second region mag05 archidona r2 0 958 got the best performance using mlp while alm10 adra r2 0 822 was the worst overall most of the aws performed above 0 9 in both regions on average the results carried out by ml models in the first region was higher than in the second region r2 0 930 0 028 and r2 0 895 0 038 respectively finally in terms of mbe figs 12 and 13 show the mbe values for the different models in the two analyzed regions on average the mbe performance in region 1 is mbe 0 099 0 363 mm d whereas in the second region is mbe 0 032 0 307 mm d besides mlp generally outperformed the rest of the models in most of the cases having the best value at 66 sites out of 89 whereas elm outperformed hs and mlp only at 6 locations the best value from the first region was carried out in sev12 la rinconada mbe 0 000 mm d using elm jae09 linares mbe 0 002 mm d using mlp and gra03 loja mbe 0 011 mm d using hs while in the second region cad04 villamartín mbe 0 005 mm d using elm alm10 adra mbe 0 027 mm d using mlp and cad01 basurta jerez de la frontera mbe 0 035 mm d using mlp performed as the best all in all the average rmse nse and r2 values of ml models in the first region rmse 0 665 mm d nse 0 894 and r2 0 930 were better than those obtained in the second rmse 0 712 mm d nse 0 863 and r2 0 894 whereas in terms of average mbe both regions got a similar performance mbe 0 040 mm d a possible justification for this behavior may be related to the effect of smoother dtr values in et0 modeling as it has already been stated by other works in this same region bellido jiménez et al 2020 estévez et al 2012 there is a lower accuracy in coastal sites modeling temperature based et0 and rs thus modeling et0 in coastal zones or inland sites with similar dtr multifractal characteristics has a negative effect on the final model performance moreover the improvements of ml models against hs were less significant in region 1 than those carried out in region 2 regarding mean rmse rmsebestml hs 0 157 mm d and rmsebestml hs 0 212 respectively and nse nsebestml hs 0 056 and nse 0 091 respectively it seems to be the result of two main issues the better performance of machine learning models compared to empirical equations and the higher information extraction from the temperature based features energyt htx and htn compared to only using tx tn and ra hs equation besides mlp predominantly outperformed the rest of the models elm and hs for the great majority of cases however the ml models underperformed in two sites from the first region gra02 puebla de don fadrique and sev101 ifapa centro de las torres tomejil finca tomejil one of the possible reasons may be the high wind speed values over the years fig 14 with average values of 2 696 m s and 2 408 m s respectively table 2 as an example wind speed data of two more stations have been included in this figure jae08 úbeda and cor02 adamuz with average values of 0 95 m s and 1 03 m s respectively 3 2 assessment of configurations in order to evaluate the different configurations table 5 shows the minimum mean and maximum values of rmse nse r2 and mbe as well as the gpi of the different configurations for all the aws using mlp due to its significant better results in the previous section generally there were no big differences in performance between any of the ten configurations in terms of rmse the configuration iv obtained the best performance rmsemin 0 473 mm d and rmsemean 0 669 mm d followed very closely by configuration vi rmsemin 0 476 mm d and rmsemean 0 673 mm d regarding nse the configuration iv outperformed the rest of the configurations on average nse 0 889 while the configuration viii carried out the highest value nsemax 0 953 besides in terms of r2 configurations i and vi obtained the best mean performance r2 0 922 and r2 0 922 respectively whereas configuration 4 got the highest value r2 0 966 in terms of mbe configuration x obtained the minimum value mbe 0 000 mm d while configuration iv carried out the best performance on average mbe 0 038 mm d finally to evaluate all these statistics a global performance indicator gpi was calculated ranking configurations iv gpi 0 429 i gpi 0 4236 v vi and vii gpi 0 4190 as the best in this order table 6 shows the same information as table 5 although they were calculated using only the results from the first region regarding rmse configuration iv outperformed the rest of the configurations in absolute and average terms rmsemin 0 473 mm d and rmsemean 0 657 mm d in terms of nse configuration iv also carried out the best nse performance on average nse 0 897 whereas configuration viii obtained the maximum value nse 0 953 regarding r2 on average configuration vi r2 0 931 obtained the best performance followed very closely by configurations iv and v r2 0 931 whereas on maximum values configurations iv r2 0 966 i r2 0 965 and ii r2 0 965 were at the top of the ranking in terms of mbe all the minimum and mean performances were very accurate obtaining values below 0 06 on average being configuration iv the one that obtained the best average value mbe 0 038 mm d on the other hand the best value was carried out by configuration vi mbe 0 001 mm d closely followed by configuration vi mbe 0 001 mm d finally regarding the gpi configuration iv was at the top of the ranking gpi 0 433 and the configuration vi as the second gpi 0 425 table 7 show the same information as table 6 although they were calculated using the results from the second region regarding the rmse performance the configuration iv obtained the lowest minimum and mean values rmsemin 0 548 mm d and rmsemean 0 703 mm d in terms of nse the maximum values were carried out by the configurations i nse 0 9267 and iv nse 0 926 while on average configurations iv and x were the best nse 0 867 as regards the r2 performance on average the top configurations were configuration i r2 0 897 iv r2 0 897 and vi r2 0 896 whereas in absolute terms the configurations vi r2 0 959 i r2 0 958 and iv r2 0 958 were the best in terms of mbe configurations vi mbe 0 025 mm d iv mbe 0 037 mm d vii mbe 0 039 mm d and ix mbe 0 036 mm d obtained mbe 0 4 on average besides the best value was carried out by the configuration x mbe 0 000 mm d finally regarding the gpi performance the top configurations were configurations iv gpi 0 295 i gpi 0 289 and x gpi 0 288 in this order to sum up the configuration iv obtained the best gpi performance in both regions highlighting accurate generalization of this configuration as well as the importance of introducing energyt day energyt day 1 htx day and tx day 1 as a complement to the hs inputs to outperform et0 estimations 3 3 seasonal performance due to the good results of configuration iv for both regions the following analysis has been carried out only using this configuration as well as the mlp model the following figures show the rmse fig 15 nse fig 16 r2 fig 17 and mbe fig 18 for winter summer spring and autumn in both regions generally the results obtained in region 1 outperformed those obtained in region 2 besides the estimations carried out in winter and autumn were better than those calculated in summer and spring moreover specifically regarding rmse winter obtained the best performance rmse 0 307 mm d in jae06 alcaudete whereas the worst value was obtained in summer rmse 1 414 mm d in sev11 osuna both carried out in the first region on average the results of aws from the first region outperformed those obtained in the second region having a mean difference of 0 075 mm d between the different regions and seasons in terms of nse the best results were carried out in autumn nse 0 878 in jae101 torreperogil whereas the worst value was also obtained in summer nse 0 770 in mag101 ifapa centro de campanillas on average spring and autumn obtained the most accurate performances followed by winter and summer in this order regarding the r2 autumn and winter carried out the best value in absolute terms r2 0 937 and r2 0 922 respectively whereas on average autumn and spring were on top besides as it is common in the aforementioned statistics rmse nse and r2 the results given by the first region outperformed those obtained in the second region eventually regarding the mbe the results obtained by both regions were very accurate on average mbe values close to 0 with no significant differences from one another however the interquartile range of autumn and winter was lower than in spring and summer denoting a more precise estimation of the first two seasons 3 4 overall discussion in the first place comparing the regional approach developed in this work with the local calibration carried out in this same region by bellido jiménez et al 2020 the results were promising for example in mag01 the regional models outperformed local calibration in terms of rmse nse and r2 rmseregional 0 548 mm d rmselocal 0 595 mm d nseregional 0 922 nselocal 0 909 r2 regional 0 924 and r2 local 0 911 whereas in the rest of the sites the results were very close one another in terms of accuracy besides the results obtained in this work outperformed those carried out by ferreira and da cunha 2020a where et0 was estimated using sub daily temperature 24 hourly values as features and the region was randomly generated across the whole study area the state of minas gerais brazil in terms of nse an r2 on average mlp using the configuration 4 outperformed the results of cnn in brazil nsebrazil 0 83 r2 brazil 0 87 nseregion 1 0 89 r2 region 1 0 93 nseregion 2 0 87 and r2 region 2 0 89 however the mean rmse performance was slightly better in brazil obtaining an rmse 0 52 mm d whereas in this work the mean values were rmseregion 1 0 65 mm d and rmseregion 2 0 70 mm d moreover the results of this study also outperformed those obtained by kazemi et al 2021 where the training dataset was composed of 10 stations from turkey using gep and the models were assessed in 18 locations in iran with different climate aridity conditions 6 arid locations 6 semi arid locations and 6 humid locations on average the results from the arid semi arid and humid locations were r2 0 823 r2 0 888 and r2 0 859 respectively finally the results from this work were very similar to those carried out by yan et al 2021 where meteorological data from adjacent stations were used for training the results in terms of rmse and nse were on average rmse 0 685 mm d and nse 0 922 for the arid locations and rmse 0 6425 mm d and nse 0 849 for humid sites in general comparing the results from the two different regions those carried out in sites from the first region were better in all statistics than those obtained in aws from the second where the first region got an rmse 0 657 mm d nse 0 897 r2 0 931 and mbe 0 05 mm d and the second rmse 0 72 mm d nse 0 85 r2 0 89 and mbe 0 04 mm d a possible justification may be related to the effect of smoother dtr values for et0 modeling the same as it happens in coastal sites for this same region bellido jiménez et al 2020 estévez et al 2012 moreover seasonally regarding rmse nse and r2 the models deployed in region 1 also outperformed those carried out in the second in all the seasons being spring and autumn the ones that obtained the best results in terms of nse and r2 however in terms of rmse winter outperformed the rest of the seasons although it is related to the lower et0 values during this period in this region besides ml highly outperformed hs in most of the cases especially mlp which could be the result of two main issues the better performance of machine learning models compared to empirical equations and the higher information extraction from the temperature based features energyt htx and htn compared to only using tx tn and ra hs equation it is worth noting that configuration iv which is composed of the variables tx day 1 tx day tn day ra day energyt day 1 energyt day and htx day obtained the best performance in both regions carrying out a gpi performance of gpi 0 433 in the first region and a gpi 0 295 in the second region it states the valuable information of energyt and htx for temperature based et0 estimations furthermore the improvements of mlp against hs were more significant in the second region in terms of rmse rmsebestml hs 0 157 mm d and rmsebestml hs 0 212 mm d for the first and second region respectively nse and r2 up to a 37 5 for the first region and up to 44 7 for the second region whereas regarding mbe there was no such significant difference between them nevertheless there were 2 sites gra02 and sev101 where ml underperformed hs in terms of rmse and nse by around 0 1 mm d whereas regarding r2 ml models were always superior this weird low accuracy in ml models seems to be related to high wind speed values moreover regarding the bayesian optimization deeper mlp architectures more than 3 hidden layers and more than 15 neurons per layer were selected as the fittest for this task due to the higher number of inputs compared to other literature works addressing temperature based approaches only using 3 or 4 inputs such as ra tx tn and tm which is the cause of the higher computational cost of mlp against elm more than 3 million weights to update during the backpropagation process in the worse scenario a possible limitation in this work is the strong dependence on accurate and representative temperature records since the models exclusively depend on temperature values besides despite andalusia being a very geoclimatic heterogeneous region it would be interesting to assess these two models in different regions with different characteristics such as extreme aridity index locations finally the use of unsupervised machine learning approaches such as k means cluster can be further evaluated as well as the use of more variables such as rh u2 and rs 4 conclusions in this work the main objective was to come up with a novel approach to temperature based et0 models to deal with the problem of requiring in situ large datasets to build accurate ml models in this sense a new regionalization has been carried out based on multifractal characteristics of dtr values into two main regions thus it allows a more accurate station grouping regardless of their geographical distribution only using temperature values for this purpose up to 70 different configurations have been assessed using combinations of tx tn energyt htx and htn from the same and previous day as the target but only the best 10 input configurations were evaluated in this work the configuration composed of the variables tx day 1 tx day tn day ra day energyt day 1 energyt day and htx day was the one that obtained the best modeling in both regions moreover mlp highly outperformed the rest of the models in terms of rmse nse and r2 whereas regarding mbe no such significant differences were appreciated the results of mlp due to the results of this work it could be stated that et0 models deployed in areas from the first region were more accurate than those carried out in the second however relatively the outperformance of mlp against hs was more significant than aws sites from the second region finally the approaches proposed in this work may result in greater efficiency for optimizing water resources allowing to accurately estimate et0 only using temperature records funding this work was supported by the

9253,accurate estimations of reference evapotranspiration et0 are crucial for determining crop water requirements and designing an adequate irrigation scheduling to optimize the use of water in this work a new clustering method to outperform the accuracy of et0 estimations only using temperature variables has been developed and assessed based on the multifractal properties of the diurnal temperature range dtr thus a more accurate weather stations grouping method has been evaluated regardless of their geographic location all the datasets were collected from 89 automated weather stations in the period 2000 2018 and pooled into two main regions 1 and 2 in each region an iterative procedure has been carried out 1 selection of all the stations except the candidate one for the training procedure and 2 test procedure using the candidate station the results showed that machine learning models ml highly outperformed hargreaves samani hs in most of the cases being multilayer perceptron mlp the most accurate over extreme learning machine models elm on average the results obtained by mlp using the best configuration in the first region were better than those obtained in the second region specifically the first region got an root mean square error rmse 0 657 mm d nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 897 coefficient of determination r2 0 931 and mean bias error mbe 0 04 mm d while the second region obtained an rmse 0 703 mm d nse 0 867 r2 0 897 and mbe 0 045 mm d regarding the seasonal performance spring and autumn obtained the best nse and r2 results whereas winter carried out the lowest rmse values this study provides a new and more accurate methodology to improve et0 estimations on a regional basis and only using temperature data in the whole process keywords

crucial to optimizing water resources management and developing a more precise irrigation scheduling it is significantly impactful in semiarid and arid areas like andalusia southern spain where precipitation is generally scarce peña gallardo et al 2016 with very hot and dry summers and characterized by a structural water deficit estévez et al 2020 the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao recommends the physic based penman monteith formula pm et0 as the sole standard method for its computation allen et al 1998 however the number of required measured variables to compute pm et0 is very high air temperature t relative humidity rh wind speed u2 and solar radiation rs which is translated into the costly installation and maintenance of the automated weather stations aws besides they usually contain non reliable long term datasets due to miscalibration and lack of maintenance issues estévez et al 2016 2011 thus the geographical density of complete aws is generally low mainly in developing countries and rural areas estévez et al 2012 world meteorological organization 2018 in these terms several studies have analyzed new methodologies to determine et0 using a limited dataset such as the well known hargreaves samani equation hargreaves and samani 1985 it calculates et0 using the daily maximum tx and minimum air temperature tn as well as the extraterrestrial solar radiation ra which is calculated using the latitude of the site and the day of the year moreover machine learning ml and deep learning dl models have gained extraordinary attention for achieving state of art performance to compute et0 in different climatic and aridity conditions for example bellido jiménez et al 2020 analyzed the performance of multilayer perceptron mlp random forest rf support vector machine svm extreme learning machine elm generalized regression neural network grnn and extreme gradient boosting xgboost models using novel temperature based variables such as energyt and htx in different sites of andalusia south of spain despite no model significantly outperformed the rest elm and mlp usually gave the best results whereas grnn was significantly the worst in all cases and statistics besides the introduction of these novel variables improved the et0 estimations compared to only using tx tn and ra zhou et al 2020 evaluated deep factorization machine deepfm gradient boosting decision tree gbdt light gradient boosting method lightgbm gradient boosting with categorial feature support catboost xgboost rf and svm to estimate daily et0 in 12 sites in china muhammad et al 2021 studied the efficiency of gene expression programming gep to estimate daily et0 in 10 sites in malaysia they assessed up to 9 different configurations using air t rh rs and u2 variables in some cases their gep results could obtain similar results to pm et0 values adnan et al 2021 evaluated a new hybrid neuron fuzzy method based on moth flame optimization mfo water cycle optimization algorithm wca and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis they tested up to 9 configurations using variables derived from t sunshine duration n rh and u2 the use of anfis wcmfo a hybrid of both wca and mfo outperformed anfis wca and anfis mfo sattari et al 2021 evaluated gaussian process regression gpr broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno artificial neural network bfgs ann and long short term memory lstm to estimate monthly et0 using 10 different input features configurations derived from tm mean air temperature tx tn and rh u2and n in turkey bedi 2022 evaluated the concept of transfer learning using the knowledge acquired from one task to improve others to outperform et0 forecasts addressing the problem of low efficiency due to small training datasets two approaches were considered 1 training the models using datasets from the nearest cluster different from the target and eventually fine tuning at the target cluster 2 training the models using the nearest site to the target location within the same cluster and fine tuning using information from the target site besides support vector regression svr deep multilayer perceptron dnn recurrent neural network rnn and long short term memory lstm were assessed using historical data to predict current timestamp values the results showed slightly less prediction error and improved reliability when compared to a local training methodology maroufpoor et al 2020 evaluated the potential of mlp and grey wolf optimization gwo to estimate et0 in iran up to 7 input configurations were assessed using tx tn rh n u2 and p precipitation being the configuration containing tx tn and u2 the most accurate model malik et al 2020 analyzed the performance of multiple model multilayer perceptron mm mlp multivariate adaptive regression spline mars svm multi gene genetic programming mggp and m5tree to estimate pan evapotranspiration epm in two stations of india mm mlp and mggp obtained the best results dimitriadou and nikolakopoulos 2021 estimated annual actual evapotranspiration et0 using empirical methods such as turc modified turc and coutagne and compared them to modis et for the period 2016 2019 in greece the results arised that turc could serve as an alternative to modis annual et despite the promising results of the aforementioned models most of the developed models were trained and tested using data from the same station local calibration which is impractical in real life applications except for gap filling consequently it is needed to build new regional models that can be deployed in new sites not used for calibration or for training the model in these terms gavilán et al 2006 evaluated a regional calibration based on the diurnal temperature range dtr and annual wind speed of hs equation using 88 aws in andalusia southern spain covering a diversity of climatic conditions from semi desert to subtropical coastal areas dai et al 2009 analyzed mlp and multi linear regression mlr to estimate monthly et0 in three different regions of mongolia according to its aridity index arid semi arid and sub humid climate their models were trained using data from multiple stations within the same subregion having similar climate conditions besides they tested using daily t rh u2 and n as inputs obtaining rmse 0 130 mm d 1 and r2 0 986 ramírez cuesta et al 2017 evaluated different approaches to estimate et0 at a regional scale using remote sensing and aws data they assessed two main approaches in order to calculate et0 using data from the closest station or the most similar weather station in andalusia their results arose that the use of the most similar aws resulted in an average error lower than 2 3 however their results were not homogeneous throughout the entire region having high differences between the lower section of the guadalquivir valley registering the smallest errors and the mountainous areas with abrupt changes in et0 values feng et al 2017 evaluated rf and grnn to estimate et0 in two locations with similar climate conditions in the sichuan basin southwest china they performed cross validation using data from both sites their results for the temperature based approaches using tx tn and ra were slightly more accurate in rf than in grnn but both models underestimated et0 since the actual values were greater at both stations ferreira and da cunha 2020a assessed rf mlp and convolutional neural networks cnn to estimate daily et0 in the state of minas gerais in brazil they firstly analyzed using hourly temperature and relative humidity data on a regional and local scenario the cnn approach exhibited the best results in all cases providing performance gains of up to 11 9 in terms of root mean squared error rmse and 7 8 in terms of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse regarding the regional scenario they used 43 aws with different climate conditions as training data while 10 stations representing the different climate variability from the training dataset were used as testing data trajkovic et al 2019 provided an adjustment of the thornthwaite equation for the vojvodina region serbia using data from 5 different aws and introducing data from three meteorological stations outside the study area this new approach cth gave accurate estimates generally being the best model in the site of timisoara fang et al 2018 evaluated partial mutual information pmi which captures the linear and nonlinear dependencies to forecast et0 using mlr svm and rf for 15 sites divided into two different regions the jing river basin and the beilvo river basin of china based on their results it could be stated that pmi presented a better performance for excluding redundant information than partial correlation based input selection pcis besides svm and rf could not always outperform the forecast of mlr models wu et al 2021 compared the results of kernel extreme learning machine kelm anfis and rf among others to estimate monthly et0 on a regional scale using data from 26 stations in china finally ferreira and da cunha 2020b evaluated different models rf mlp lstm cnn and lstm cnn to forecast daily et0 for up to a week in 53 weather stations in brazil following the procedure described in ferreira and da cunha 2020a generally according to the aforementioned literature several important methodological drawbacks need to be addressed in terms of developing training and deploying regional et0 models on the one hand due to the lack of open reliable meteorological datasets several authors have grouped aws data that belong to the same country or region geographical criteria and even places with no apparent geoclimatic relationship among them places from different countries latitudes and climatic conditions it has been stated by several authors the existence of different performances in et0 estimations according to the aridity index of the site obtaining better modelings in humid zones and worse results in more arid and semi arid locations paredes and pereira 2019 shiri et al 2014 thus developing a single model for sites with different geoclimatic conditions may arise in less efficient models on the other hand in order to deal with this issue a possible solution could be making regions from sites that have similar aridity index values despite this last approach being convenient to obtain accurate models the main problem is that it requires not only the same variables that pm et0 equation needs but also precipitation thus the development of robust and accurate regional models able to estimate et0 with limited availability datasets has not been addressed yet there is a great need to apply innovative approaches in non used sites training calibration with a very low budget but still having confident accuracy estimations thereby in this work a novel machine learning method has been assessed in order to outperform temperature based regional et0 estimations the stations grouping criterion is based on a multifractal characterization of the diurnal temperature range dtr following the work of herrera grimaldi et al 2019 where 197 aws from the spanish meteorological agency aemet that had similar multifractal behavior were grouped as the same cluster these geographical clusters were taken into account using new aws from a different aws network in andalusia the use of this multifractal characterization regionalization technique allows a more accurate stations grouping regardless of their geographical distribution only using daily temperature values for this purpose it is worth noting that no similar work has previously used a clustering method based on dtr multifractal properties to outperform et0 estimations in a regional scenario besides due to the promising results of mlp and elm for estimating and predicting et0 and solar radiation in this same region bellido jiménez et al 2022 2021 2020 outperforming the rest of the ml models significantly both models are assessed in this work thus the main objectives of this work are i the evaluation of a clustering procedure based on the multifractal characterization of dtr ii the assessment of mlp and elm models to estimate et0 only using temperature based features on a regional scenario iii the analysis of different input feature configurations for each region and iv the study the seasonal performance for each region 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of data and data management the study area is the region of andalusia which is located in southwest europe this region occupies a total area of 87 268 km2 and ranges from 1 to 7 ºw longitude and from 37 to 39ºn latitude it has a very heterogeneous climate from the mediterranean to the continental mountainous oceanic tropical and sub desert moreover the datasets used in this work belong to 89 aws from the agroclimatic information network of andalusia ria all these aws measure air temperature relative humidity of the air wind speed and direction at 2 m height solar radiation and precipitation the sensors specifications are shown in table 1 from april 2000 to july 2018 for a daily and sub daily every 30 min sampling rate they can be freely downloaded at https www juntadeandalucia es agriculturaypesca ifapa riaweb web accessed 8th march 2022 one of the key aspects for obtaining accurate modeling to estimate et0 on a regional basis is how we group the datasets of all the studied aws in this case two main regions were considered based on the previous work of herrera grimaldi et al 2019 where a multifractal characterization of dtr values was carried out for 258 aws from the spanish aemet meteorology statal agency and grouped them based on their multifractal characteristics in this work the authors studied the scaling of the statistical moments to detect the multifractal behavior using the scaling exponent function k q that satisfies eq 1 schertzer and lovejoy 1987 1 ε λ q λ k q where ε λ q corresponds to the average qth moment of the intensity of the process for a λ resolution the k q function becomes linear for q values higher than the critical qcritical which is defined as γ max eq 2 2 γ max max k q where γ is the order of singularity and γ max its maximum value de lima and de lima 2009 the γ max gives important information about the process analyzed lower values are related to extreme values whereas higher gamma values are characteristic of the smoothest processes for further information the following works can be revised garcía marín et al 2013 herrera grimaldi et al 2019 2018 the whole studied area was divided into two regions region 1 is composed of stations with low γ max γ max 0 07216 while region 2 includes those stations with γ max higher than 0 07216 fig 1 shows the spatial distribution of the aws and the considered regions and table 2 the characteristics of all the aws studied in this work as well as the geographical location of both regions in order to guarantee reliable results an essential prerequisite is the application of quality assurance tests where erroneous values are flagged and further evaluated the guidelines described by estévez et al 2011 2018 have been followed applying range tests regarding the specifications for each sensor as well as physical and climate extremes for each location and variable internal consistency tests based on physics and climatological consistency for each location and variable step tests based on time consistency persistence checking the variability of the measurements and spatial consistency designed to detect gross errors for observations tests to all meteorological data afterward the daily et0 was calculated using the pm et0 formula allen et al 1998 which was used as the target variable as well as the rest of the daily temperature based features bellido jiménez et al 2020 the maximum and minimum air temperature tx and tn respectively td tx tn the integral of the half hourly temperature values of a day energyt the time of day in hours when the tx and tn occur htx and htn respectively besides 70 different input configurations were previously assessed where the following variables were considered tx day 1 tx day tn day 1 tn day tn day 1 ra day td day htx day 1 htx day htn day 1 htn day energyt day 1 and energyt day however only the ten best configurations have been further discussed in this work see table 3 it is worth noting that tn day 1 was analyzed based on the work of bristow and campbell 1984 where they use tn day 1 to calculate tm average temperature in order to achieve the goals of this work the following control loop was followed 1 all the available datasets from ria were collected on daily and intradaily every half hour basis 2 several quality assurance tests range step internal consistency persistence and spatial consistency tests were applied following the procedures described in estévez et al 2016 2011 3 all the stations were grouped into two regions based on the multifractal characterization carried out by herrera grimaldi et al 2019 4 then to perform an exhaustive assessment in each region one ml model was developed for each aws a form of cross validation on a regional basis at each site the model was trained using the dataset from all aws in the region except for the candidate station while the dataset from the selected site was later used for testing purposes for example in the case of cor06 córdoba which is part of the first region the model to estimate et0 at this site was trained using the whole dataset of region 1 except the data from cor06 5 then for each aws in the region and in order to tune the different hyperparameters a hold out technique is used instead due to the enough size of the training dataset almost 400 000 registers for the first region and more than 100 000 registers for the second to avoid overfitting hossein kazemi et al 2020 shiri et al 2019 in these terms the bayesian optimization and validation dataset 30 of the training dataset were used 6 finally the final model was fully trained using the initial training dataset and assessed using the testing dataset the data from the candidate aws fig 2 shows a graphical summary of this methodology 2 2 reference evapotranspiration in this work the et0 values calculated using the pm et0 equation allen et al 1998 were used as the target values for the developed models it can be mathematically expressed as eq 3 3 pm et 0 0 408 rn g γ 900 t 273 u 2 es ea γ 1 0 34 u 2 where pm et0 is the reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 calculated using this equation 0 408 corresponds to a coefficient mj 1 m2 mm is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure versus temperature curve kpa c 1 rn is the net radiation calculated at the crop surface mj m 2 day 1 g is the soil heat flux density at the soil surface mj m 2 day 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 t is the mean daily air temperature c u2 is the mean daily wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 and es and ea are the saturation vapor pressure and the mean actual vapor pressure respectively kpa however it is not always possible to find aws collecting all the required parameters by pm et0 due to the expensive implementation and maintenance of these devices and the existence of missing and non reliable wind speed and solar radiation data is high estévez et al 2012 paola and giugni 2013 thus different temperature based approaches have been developed to handle this problem such as the hargreaves samani hs equation developed by hargreaves and samani 1985 as an empirical equation that only uses tx day tm day tn day and ra day to compute et0 eq 4 hs has been widely applied to different climates and countries luo et al 2014 shiri et al 2014 üneş et al 2020 yin et al 2020 4 hs et 0 0 0135 k tm 17 8 tx tn ra where hs et0 is the reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 calculated using hs equation and k is a coefficient 0 16 for inland and 0 19 for coastal locations additionally even though hs is the most common worldwide temperature based method there are other temperature based methodologies such as the thornthwaite equation thornthwaite and mather 1957 or the approximation from fao 56 allen et al 1998 2 3 machine learning models all the models were developed using the public repository from github agroml bellido jiménez et al 2022 which can be publicly accessed at https github com smarity agroml accessed march 16 2022 besides all the computations were carried out in a server workstation with the following characteristics 1 cpu amd ryzen threadripper pro 3955wx 16 cores 3 9 ghz 1 gpu nvidia rtx 3090 and 128 gb of ram based on the performance obtained in previous works bellido jiménez et al 2020 two kinds of models have been assessed multilayer perceptron mlp and extreme learning machine elm 2 3 1 multilayer perceptron the multilayer perceptron mlp is based on the neurons from the biological nervous systems which is one of the reasons for its high reputation besides it is characterized by easy coding and promising results within et0 estimations in most cases antonopoulos and antonopoulos 2017 ferreira et al 2019 ferreira and da cunha 2020a yassin et al 2016 they are structured into three different layers the input layer that represents the inputs of the model the hidden layer or layers where the neurons are located and the output layer that represents the outputs of the model et0 in this case for example for an mlp architecture with two inputs one single hidden layer containing three neurons and one output the structure is represented by fig 3 and eqs 5 6 7 and 8 5 x 1 1 f x 1 0 w 11 0 x 2 0 w 21 0 b 1 0 6 x 2 1 f x 1 0 w 12 0 x 2 0 w 22 0 b 2 0 7 x 3 1 f x 1 0 w 12 0 x 2 0 w 22 0 b 3 0 8 y 1 f x 1 1 w 11 1 x 2 1 w 21 1 x 3 1 w 31 1 b 1 1 where x 0 1 and x 0 2 represents the inputs of the model x 1 1 x 1 2 and x 1 3 represents the neurons of the hidden layer y1 the output itself and w represents the weights of each connection the weights of the model are automatically updated using a backpropagation algorithm during the training period 2 3 2 extreme learning machine extreme learning machine elm models are a novel approach guang bin et al 2004 composed of a single hidden layer feedforward neural network with much fewer computational requirements than mlps the main feature of this model is that the weights of the inputs are automatically generated while the weights of the outputs are analytically calculated thereby there is no need to carry out a backpropagation training process which makes these models have a very low computational cost and high demand for ram if the dataset is very large several works have assessed its use in et0 estimation and prediction worldwide kisi and alizamir 2018 wu et al 2021 2 4 bayesian optimization a critical aspect of obtaining accurate predictions in ml models is choosing a correct hyperparameter set depending on the chosen hyperparameters the performance could dramatically change from accurate to very poor results the hyperparameters of ml models modify their architecture and internal functional configuration for example the number of hidden layers the hidden neurons within each layer and the activation function among others in mlp one of the most common techniques to deal with hyperparameter selection is a trial and error technique where different values are evaluated and the best one is chosen however using this technique there is no assurance of the accurate performance of our model a more efficient approach is the use of bayesian optimization bo based on the bayes theorem and with high relation to human behavior when addressing this problem borji and itti 2013 shahriari et al 2016 because it takes into account the previous results to select the next set of hyperparameters to test even though there exist other algorithms that deal with hyperparameter tuning such as particle swarm optimization pso grey wolf optimizer gwo genetic algorithms ga whale optimization algorithm woa among others alizamir et al 2020 roy et al 2020 tikhamarine et al 2020 the popularity of bayesian optimization is very high in automated machine learning libraries like auto weka 2 0 kotthoff et al 2017 auto keras jin et al 2019 and auto sklearn feurer et al 2015 and they can be further consulted in hutter et al 2019 besides its popularity in et0 models is high alibabaei et al 2021 bateni et al 2021 the bayesian optimization can be explained using four steps 1 the hyperparameter space is set defining the limit values of all the hyperparameters 2 the algorithm asses several random values for all the hyperparameters 3 the algorithm set the next hyperparameter values to be evaluated taking into account the previous experience weighing up between exploitation choosing values known to have outstanding results or exploration choosing values with higher uncertainty behavior 4 if it has not finished yet it repeats step 3 in this work the bayesian optimization algorithm from agroml has been used which had been implemented using the scikit optimize library both models elm and mlp were configured to carry out 50 bayesian epochs 40 of them were randomly generated and the mean absolute error mae as the objective function table 4 shows the hyperparameter space of the models and figs 4 and 5 show the bo results from elm and mlp respectively 2 5 statistical analysis all the models were analyzed in order to evaluate their performance using the mbe the rmse the r2 nse and the global performance indicator gpi the mbe rmse r2 nse and gpi can be defined as eqs 9 10 11 12 and 13 respectively 9 mbe 1 n i 1 n x i y i 10 rmse 1 n i 1 n x i y i 2 11 r 2 i 1 n x i x y i y 2 i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 12 nse 1 i 1 n x i y i 2 i 1 n x i x 2 13 gpi j m 1 4 α m stat m stat mj where i represents each record n represents the number of records x represents the et0 values calculated using the fao56 pm formula y represents the estimations from models α is a coefficient being 1 for rmse and 1 for r2 and nse m represents each statistical performance indicator mbe rmse r2 and nse j defines a specific configuration statmj represents the performance indicator value normalized it is worth noting that instead of using the original mbe values their absolute values were calculated and the bar denotes the mean value besides in order to compare how ml models performed compared to hs the difference in the different statistics is shown as statbestml hs statbestml staths where stat represents any of the statistics mbe rmse r2 and nse 3 results and discussion to further evaluate the different results of this work all the graphs can be interactively revised as an html file in the additional files section 3 1 the evaluation of ml models in the different regions figs 6 and 7 show the rmse values for the best configuration at each site for regions 1 and 2 respectively generally both elm and mlp ml highly outperformed hs in most of the cases obtaining the highest improvement in jae08 úbeda rmsebestml hs 0 533 mm d and cad07 jimena de la frontera rmsebestml hs 0 410 mm d for regions 1 and 2 respectively the lowest rmse values were obtained in the stations hue09 la palma del condado rmsebestml 0 473 mm d for the first region and in mag01 málaga for the second rmsebestml 0 548 mm d on the one hand most of the sites got rmse values below 0 8 mm d for both regions even below 0 6 mm d for a high percentage of aws on the other hand very few locations jae102 villacarrillo alm06 virgen de fátima cuevas de almanzora and sev11 osuna obtained rmse values above 1 0 mm d using ml models besides only in 2 locations from the first region gra02 puebla de don fabrique and sev101 ifapa centro las torres tomejil finca tomejil the ml underperformed hs with an error of around 0 1 mm d it is also worth noting that in general the average ml performance in the first region was better than in the second rmsereg1 0 665 0 151 mm d and rmsereg2 0 712 0 113 mm d although in this last region mlp and elm significantly improve the results of hs rmsebestml hs 0 157 mm d and rmsebestml hs 0 212 mm d for region 1 and 2 respectively regarding the nse values figs 8 and 9 show the nse performances for the different models assessed in both regions 1 and 2 respectively the results are similar to those obtained by analyzing the rmse performance in most of the cases ml obtained an nse value above 0 9 the best values were obtained in jae11 mancha real nse 0 963 in the first region and cad04 villamartín nse 0 926 in the second region using mlp in both cases whereas the worst model was carried out in jae102 villacarrillo nsemlp 0 596 an nseelm 0 547 and nsehs 0 459 on the other hand there was only one site where hs outperformed ml models with a nse difference higher than 0 05 nsebestml hs 0 054 gra02 puebla de don fabrique moreover the average nse values carried out by ml models in both regions were very similar to one another nsereg1 0 894 0 064 and nsereg2 0 863 0 060 finally considering the performance difference between hs and ml models the mean outperformance in the second region was higher than in the second nsebestml hs 0 056 and nsebestml hs 0 091 for regions 1 and 2 respectively considering the r2 values figs 10 and 11 show the r2 values for the different models in the two assessed regions the best ml value in the first region was performed in jae05 torreblascopedro r2 0 966 using mlp whereas the worst was carried out in mag02 vélez málaga r2 0 835 in the second region mag05 archidona r2 0 958 got the best performance using mlp while alm10 adra r2 0 822 was the worst overall most of the aws performed above 0 9 in both regions on average the results carried out by ml models in the first region was higher than in the second region r2 0 930 0 028 and r2 0 895 0 038 respectively finally in terms of mbe figs 12 and 13 show the mbe values for the different models in the two analyzed regions on average the mbe performance in region 1 is mbe 0 099 0 363 mm d whereas in the second region is mbe 0 032 0 307 mm d besides mlp generally outperformed the rest of the models in most of the cases having the best value at 66 sites out of 89 whereas elm outperformed hs and mlp only at 6 locations the best value from the first region was carried out in sev12 la rinconada mbe 0 000 mm d using elm jae09 linares mbe 0 002 mm d using mlp and gra03 loja mbe 0 011 mm d using hs while in the second region cad04 villamartín mbe 0 005 mm d using elm alm10 adra mbe 0 027 mm d using mlp and cad01 basurta jerez de la frontera mbe 0 035 mm d using mlp performed as the best all in all the average rmse nse and r2 values of ml models in the first region rmse 0 665 mm d nse 0 894 and r2 0 930 were better than those obtained in the second rmse 0 712 mm d nse 0 863 and r2 0 894 whereas in terms of average mbe both regions got a similar performance mbe 0 040 mm d a possible justification for this behavior may be related to the effect of smoother dtr values in et0 modeling as it has already been stated by other works in this same region bellido jiménez et al 2020 estévez et al 2012 there is a lower accuracy in coastal sites modeling temperature based et0 and rs thus modeling et0 in coastal zones or inland sites with similar dtr multifractal characteristics has a negative effect on the final model performance moreover the improvements of ml models against hs were less significant in region 1 than those carried out in region 2 regarding mean rmse rmsebestml hs 0 157 mm d and rmsebestml hs 0 212 respectively and nse nsebestml hs 0 056 and nse 0 091 respectively it seems to be the result of two main issues the better performance of machine learning models compared to empirical equations and the higher information extraction from the temperature based features energyt htx and htn compared to only using tx tn and ra hs equation besides mlp predominantly outperformed the rest of the models elm and hs for the great majority of cases however the ml models underperformed in two sites from the first region gra02 puebla de don fadrique and sev101 ifapa centro de las torres tomejil finca tomejil one of the possible reasons may be the high wind speed values over the years fig 14 with average values of 2 696 m s and 2 408 m s respectively table 2 as an example wind speed data of two more stations have been included in this figure jae08 úbeda and cor02 adamuz with average values of 0 95 m s and 1 03 m s respectively 3 2 assessment of configurations in order to evaluate the different configurations table 5 shows the minimum mean and maximum values of rmse nse r2 and mbe as well as the gpi of the different configurations for all the aws using mlp due to its significant better results in the previous section generally there were no big differences in performance between any of the ten configurations in terms of rmse the configuration iv obtained the best performance rmsemin 0 473 mm d and rmsemean 0 669 mm d followed very closely by configuration vi rmsemin 0 476 mm d and rmsemean 0 673 mm d regarding nse the configuration iv outperformed the rest of the configurations on average nse 0 889 while the configuration viii carried out the highest value nsemax 0 953 besides in terms of r2 configurations i and vi obtained the best mean performance r2 0 922 and r2 0 922 respectively whereas configuration 4 got the highest value r2 0 966 in terms of mbe configuration x obtained the minimum value mbe 0 000 mm d while configuration iv carried out the best performance on average mbe 0 038 mm d finally to evaluate all these statistics a global performance indicator gpi was calculated ranking configurations iv gpi 0 429 i gpi 0 4236 v vi and vii gpi 0 4190 as the best in this order table 6 shows the same information as table 5 although they were calculated using only the results from the first region regarding rmse configuration iv outperformed the rest of the configurations in absolute and average terms rmsemin 0 473 mm d and rmsemean 0 657 mm d in terms of nse configuration iv also carried out the best nse performance on average nse 0 897 whereas configuration viii obtained the maximum value nse 0 953 regarding r2 on average configuration vi r2 0 931 obtained the best performance followed very closely by configurations iv and v r2 0 931 whereas on maximum values configurations iv r2 0 966 i r2 0 965 and ii r2 0 965 were at the top of the ranking in terms of mbe all the minimum and mean performances were very accurate obtaining values below 0 06 on average being configuration iv the one that obtained the best average value mbe 0 038 mm d on the other hand the best value was carried out by configuration vi mbe 0 001 mm d closely followed by configuration vi mbe 0 001 mm d finally regarding the gpi configuration iv was at the top of the ranking gpi 0 433 and the configuration vi as the second gpi 0 425 table 7 show the same information as table 6 although they were calculated using the results from the second region regarding the rmse performance the configuration iv obtained the lowest minimum and mean values rmsemin 0 548 mm d and rmsemean 0 703 mm d in terms of nse the maximum values were carried out by the configurations i nse 0 9267 and iv nse 0 926 while on average configurations iv and x were the best nse 0 867 as regards the r2 performance on average the top configurations were configuration i r2 0 897 iv r2 0 897 and vi r2 0 896 whereas in absolute terms the configurations vi r2 0 959 i r2 0 958 and iv r2 0 958 were the best in terms of mbe configurations vi mbe 0 025 mm d iv mbe 0 037 mm d vii mbe 0 039 mm d and ix mbe 0 036 mm d obtained mbe 0 4 on average besides the best value was carried out by the configuration x mbe 0 000 mm d finally regarding the gpi performance the top configurations were configurations iv gpi 0 295 i gpi 0 289 and x gpi 0 288 in this order to sum up the configuration iv obtained the best gpi performance in both regions highlighting accurate generalization of this configuration as well as the importance of introducing energyt day energyt day 1 htx day and tx day 1 as a complement to the hs inputs to outperform et0 estimations 3 3 seasonal performance due to the good results of configuration iv for both regions the following analysis has been carried out only using this configuration as well as the mlp model the following figures show the rmse fig 15 nse fig 16 r2 fig 17 and mbe fig 18 for winter summer spring and autumn in both regions generally the results obtained in region 1 outperformed those obtained in region 2 besides the estimations carried out in winter and autumn were better than those calculated in summer and spring moreover specifically regarding rmse winter obtained the best performance rmse 0 307 mm d in jae06 alcaudete whereas the worst value was obtained in summer rmse 1 414 mm d in sev11 osuna both carried out in the first region on average the results of aws from the first region outperformed those obtained in the second region having a mean difference of 0 075 mm d between the different regions and seasons in terms of nse the best results were carried out in autumn nse 0 878 in jae101 torreperogil whereas the worst value was also obtained in summer nse 0 770 in mag101 ifapa centro de campanillas on average spring and autumn obtained the most accurate performances followed by winter and summer in this order regarding the r2 autumn and winter carried out the best value in absolute terms r2 0 937 and r2 0 922 respectively whereas on average autumn and spring were on top besides as it is common in the aforementioned statistics rmse nse and r2 the results given by the first region outperformed those obtained in the second region eventually regarding the mbe the results obtained by both regions were very accurate on average mbe values close to 0 with no significant differences from one another however the interquartile range of autumn and winter was lower than in spring and summer denoting a more precise estimation of the first two seasons 3 4 overall discussion in the first place comparing the regional approach developed in this work with the local calibration carried out in this same region by bellido jiménez et al 2020 the results were promising for example in mag01 the regional models outperformed local calibration in terms of rmse nse and r2 rmseregional 0 548 mm d rmselocal 0 595 mm d nseregional 0 922 nselocal 0 909 r2 regional 0 924 and r2 local 0 911 whereas in the rest of the sites the results were very close one another in terms of accuracy besides the results obtained in this work outperformed those carried out by ferreira and da cunha 2020a where et0 was estimated using sub daily temperature 24 hourly values as features and the region was randomly generated across the whole study area the state of minas gerais brazil in terms of nse an r2 on average mlp using the configuration 4 outperformed the results of cnn in brazil nsebrazil 0 83 r2 brazil 0 87 nseregion 1 0 89 r2 region 1 0 93 nseregion 2 0 87 and r2 region 2 0 89 however the mean rmse performance was slightly better in brazil obtaining an rmse 0 52 mm d whereas in this work the mean values were rmseregion 1 0 65 mm d and rmseregion 2 0 70 mm d moreover the results of this study also outperformed those obtained by kazemi et al 2021 where the training dataset was composed of 10 stations from turkey using gep and the models were assessed in 18 locations in iran with different climate aridity conditions 6 arid locations 6 semi arid locations and 6 humid locations on average the results from the arid semi arid and humid locations were r2 0 823 r2 0 888 and r2 0 859 respectively finally the results from this work were very similar to those carried out by yan et al 2021 where meteorological data from adjacent stations were used for training the results in terms of rmse and nse were on average rmse 0 685 mm d and nse 0 922 for the arid locations and rmse 0 6425 mm d and nse 0 849 for humid sites in general comparing the results from the two different regions those carried out in sites from the first region were better in all statistics than those obtained in aws from the second where the first region got an rmse 0 657 mm d nse 0 897 r2 0 931 and mbe 0 05 mm d and the second rmse 0 72 mm d nse 0 85 r2 0 89 and mbe 0 04 mm d a possible justification may be related to the effect of smoother dtr values for et0 modeling the same as it happens in coastal sites for this same region bellido jiménez et al 2020 estévez et al 2012 moreover seasonally regarding rmse nse and r2 the models deployed in region 1 also outperformed those carried out in the second in all the seasons being spring and autumn the ones that obtained the best results in terms of nse and r2 however in terms of rmse winter outperformed the rest of the seasons although it is related to the lower et0 values during this period in this region besides ml highly outperformed hs in most of the cases especially mlp which could be the result of two main issues the better performance of machine learning models compared to empirical equations and the higher information extraction from the temperature based features energyt htx and htn compared to only using tx tn and ra hs equation it is worth noting that configuration iv which is composed of the variables tx day 1 tx day tn day ra day energyt day 1 energyt day and htx day obtained the best performance in both regions carrying out a gpi performance of gpi 0 433 in the first region and a gpi 0 295 in the second region it states the valuable information of energyt and htx for temperature based et0 estimations furthermore the improvements of mlp against hs were more significant in the second region in terms of rmse rmsebestml hs 0 157 mm d and rmsebestml hs 0 212 mm d for the first and second region respectively nse and r2 up to a 37 5 for the first region and up to 44 7 for the second region whereas regarding mbe there was no such significant difference between them nevertheless there were 2 sites gra02 and sev101 where ml underperformed hs in terms of rmse and nse by around 0 1 mm d whereas regarding r2 ml models were always superior this weird low accuracy in ml models seems to be related to high wind speed values moreover regarding the bayesian optimization deeper mlp architectures more than 3 hidden layers and more than 15 neurons per layer were selected as the fittest for this task due to the higher number of inputs compared to other literature works addressing temperature based approaches only using 3 or 4 inputs such as ra tx tn and tm which is the cause of the higher computational cost of mlp against elm more than 3 million weights to update during the backpropagation process in the worse scenario a possible limitation in this work is the strong dependence on accurate and representative temperature records since the models exclusively depend on temperature values besides despite andalusia being a very geoclimatic heterogeneous region it would be interesting to assess these two models in different regions with different characteristics such as extreme aridity index locations finally the use of unsupervised machine learning approaches such as k means cluster can be further evaluated as well as the use of more variables such as rh u2 and rs 4 conclusions in this work the main objective was to come up with a novel approach to temperature based et0 models to deal with the problem of requiring in situ large datasets to build accurate ml models in this sense a new regionalization has been carried out based on multifractal characteristics of dtr values into two main regions thus it allows a more accurate station grouping regardless of their geographical distribution only using temperature values for this purpose up to 70 different configurations have been assessed using combinations of tx tn energyt htx and htn from the same and previous day as the target but only the best 10 input configurations were evaluated in this work the configuration composed of the variables tx day 1 tx day tn day ra day energyt day 1 energyt day and htx day was the one that obtained the best modeling in both regions moreover mlp highly outperformed the rest of the models in terms of rmse nse and r2 whereas regarding mbe no such significant differences were appreciated the results of mlp due to the results of this work it could be stated that et0 models deployed in areas from the first region were more accurate than those carried out in the second however relatively the outperformance of mlp against hs was more significant than aws sites from the second region finally the approaches proposed in this work may result in greater efficiency for optimizing water resources allowing to accurately estimate et0 only using temperature records funding this work was supported by the

9254,in the irrigation sector water related conflict has been compounded due to social issues such as climate change and urbanization induced population dynamics although irrigation management transfer imt and participatory irrigation management pim were implemented for sustainable irrigation infrastructure management results of pim imt implementations exhibit conflicts between wuas and the lack of water users associations wuas participation in management to unfold pim imt issues agent based model abm helps analyze conflicts and game theory helps analyze governing concepts underlying cooperative management such as rules this study discusses the applicability of abm and game theory to analyze conflicts over surface irrigation water and harvesting labor and also aims to present solutions to increasing conflicts due to labor resource depletion owning to urbanization to investigate cooperative wuas amid the pressure of social changes we chose wuas in bali indonesia known as subaks rice cultivation management practices of five subaks in the study area were identified by stakeholder analysis approach and we developed an abm to model water management of six agents representing subaks to examine influence of harvesting labor supply on water management noncooperative game theory was applied and three harvesting labor scenarios and two strategies were generated scenario analysis indicates that with severe shortages in the harvesting labor supply harvesting labor allocation orders could compound the decline in annual rice production this study also establishes that although current management practices maintain cooperative relationships between subaks and flexible management practices likely strengthen cooperative relationships social changes could accelerate farmers noncooperative behavior to resolve conflicts subaks need to develop cooperative relationships on a larger scale but social issues go beyond the intra community level and will require government intervention to efficiently use deceasing resource supply this method using abm and game theory will contribute to the development of socio hydrological analysis approach to sustainable resource allocation in pim imt study keywords participatory irrigation management water conflict harvesting labor subak socio hydrology sustainability 1 introduction water related conflict in the irrigation sector has been evolving owning to population growth and increased food consumption the available water supply is reaching its limit in satisfying water demand steduto et al 2012 to resolve conflict over irrigation water and promote food security the irrigation sector which uses 70 of the total withdrawn freshwater globally must improve water use efficiency fao 2020 however water conflict has been more complicated because of climate change rice growing regions such as south east asia and eastern africa must adapt to delays in rainy reason onset and increase in floods droughts and rainfall variability and intensity adhikari et al 2015 sekhar 2018 unprecedented climate change and urbanization induced population dynamics can cause water related conflicts in rice farming exchanged labor is commonly used talhelm and english 2020 but due to the population leaving rural areas and migrating to cities agricultural labor structure has been transforming which can cause conflicts over labor and thus impact water use the irrigation sector must develop measures to resolve conflict to promote sustainable irrigation water use for sustainable irrigation infrastructure management irrigation management transfer imt was implemented targeting management transfer from the government sector to the private sector through water users associations wuas after negative results on management were exposed worldwide garces restrepo et al 2007 vermillion 1997 the world bank proposed participatory irrigation management pim pim emphasizes users involvement and aims to utilize local knowledge regarding efficient water use and irrigation facility management ishii and satoh 2003 groenfeldt 2000 however a comparative analysis of pim imt implementation indicates a mixture of positive and negative results about regarding the fairness of water allocation irrigation performance financial management productivity and environmental sustainability mukherji et al 2009 senanayake et al 2015 vermillion 1997 based on these findings the irrigation sector has realized that human aspects of water resource management require more attention jones 1995 steinberg 1983 water resource management has been widely studied in terms of socio ecological systems which comprise local ecosystem and management practices akamani 2016 colding and barthel 2019 downard et al 2014 merrill et al 2018 ostrom 2009 rathwell and peterson 2012 studies on hydrological conditions has evolved into socio hydrology in recent years kuil et al 2018 pouladi et al 2019 to understand institutional arrangements the stakeholder analysis approach has been used in pim imt studies belay and bewket 2013 ghumman et al 2014 maleza and nishimura 2007 reed et al 2009 researchers often discovered insufficient wua capacity gany et al 2019 ricks 2016 and the need for greater governmental commitment to improve participatory water management which includes implementing reform policies to support institutional wua establishment increasing farmers participation in management activities and clarifying the roles of wuas and the government garces restrepo et al 2007 hamada and samad 2011 johnson et al 2020 musa 2009 shindo and yamamoto 2017 singh et al 2014 to give insights regarding these findings agent based model abm and game theory can be employed abm helps analyze conflicts among water users over water use abm has been increasingly used to examine whether an observed phenomenon that stakeholders and hydrological conditions create can be described by decision making processes identified by the stakeholder analysis approach to predict future conditions such as water allocation janssen and ostrom 2006 in abm agents representing stakeholders such as farmers and government agencies make decisions regarding the use of natural resources while interacting with other agents to exchange information such as water use under hydrological conditions lansing and kremer 1993 explained the efficiency of the existing water use coordination scale among wuas in a watershed using abm abm was also applied to a small scale irrigation system to examine the efficiency of the existing water withdrawal arrangements and the system s vulnerability to projected rainfall changes caused by climate change cifdaloz et al 2010 pérez et al 2016 water use regulation scenarios of irrigation systems were tested to prevent groundwater depletion anbari et al 2021 castilla rho et al 2015 and analyze the impact on irrigation and aquaculture schluter and pahl wostl 2007 the integration of land use change and climate change scenarios forecasts an increase in water scarcity huber et al 2021 shahpari et al 2021 predicted land use change based on farmers behavior with regard to crop selection and irrigation expansion abm is applicable for examining conflicts by analyzing emerged tangible phenomena which helps comprehend the findings revealed by pim imt studies such as unsuccessful cost reduction and ill maintained infrastructure management nonetheless to resolve pim imt issues concepts underlying phenomena such as establishments institutional arrangements practices rules customary laws and their necessity must be analyzed moreover the resolution of the issues can also be achieved by the application of game theory game theory has two forms noncooperative and cooperative games noncooperative games assume that water users individually and competitively make decisions to maximize their gain whereas cooperative games assume that water users make decisions collaboratively for water management resource problems although noncooperative games can be employed because they do not require quantitative information cooperative game theory has been applied more often because the results of cost benefit allocation issues are more understandable madani 2010 in previous studies noncooperative game theory was used to resolve water allocation problems between multiple regions tian et al 2019 between different sectors mehrparvar et al 2020 and within a basin lv et al 2019 the cooperative game theory has been applied to finding efficient and equitable water allocation in a basin han et al 2018 and to resolving a water cost allocation problem sechi et al 2013 other studies have compared the outcomes of noncooperative and cooperative game theories to identify the best water management approach for sustainable exploitation of water resources chew et al 2009 digna et al 2018 in the irrigation sector getirana and malta 2010 examined various strategies to resolve irrigation water conflict among sugarcane farmers using gmcr other studies used noncooperative game theory and created a payoff matrix to explain the reason behind pim failing in terms of irrigation fee collection hone et al 2020 institutional arrangements of groundwater have been investigated using a cooperative game theory approach kahil et al 2016 and by comparing noncooperative and cooperative game theories madani and dinar 2012 studies indicate that game theory is useful for analyzing resource allocation such as land water and labor force in the irrigation sector although game theory has been applied to examine groundwater irrigation issues few studies have been conducted that consider surface water such as paddy irrigation podimata and yannopoulos 2015 unlike groundwater depletion which influences all stakeholders water use the overexploitation of surface water resources has a greater influence on downstream users than upstream users the unequal impact on stakeholders discourages some of them from joining the discussion on cooperative management pathways to resolve water conflicts cannot always be deduced using the cooperative game theory approach rather as pim imt studies have shown the difficulty in establishing cooperative and sustainable water management and water resource management often depends on noncooperative game theory conflicts between surface water users in an irrigation system are observed within existing wuas recent wuas established by imt implementations have issues such as water theft and incompliance with rules among users unfolding development paths of rules in use value of rules in use and benefits of conflict management to wuas will contribute to resolving conflicts arising from imt issues and serve pim improvement therefore this study discusses the applicability of abm and game theory to analyze conflicts over surface irrigation water and labor it also aims to present solutions to conflicts that have increased due to labor resource depletion owning to urbanization this paper is organized as follows first irrigation management systems in the study area are described this section also touches on social change occurring around rice cultivation systems in bali subsequently the application of abm and game theory are described after the simulation results are presented the implications of cooperative and noncooperative strategy combinations and suggestions for the sustainability of irrigation water allocation under social changes are discussed the final section concludes the paper 2 material and methods 2 1 need for a case study pim imt implementations have been found to be successful globally in places where prior to pim imt implementation irrigation infrastructures existed wuas were established and rules for sharing irrigation water were developed in even successful pim imt cases the fairness and efficiency of water allocation seems to be affected by urbanization and climate change to study a successful pim case amid the pressure of urbanization this paper chooses a long enduring type of wua known as a subak subak is a term used to denote balinese wuas which are recognized as a successful pim case united states general accounting office 1983 using the subak as a case study this paper examines how subaks adapt to seasonal water supply decline on a subak level and whether water allocation stems from subaks cooperative behavior 2 2 balinese water management and social transformation around rice cultivation systems the supposed subak system is a centuries old traditional irrigation system in bali indonesia the system is tightly connected to the balinese hindu philosophy of harmony between the spirituality people and nature hafied and gany 2001 and is used in balinese rice cultivation its main role is to regulate the water supply a subak consists of all paddy fields irrigated from a single water source such as a dam or a canal and all farmers using these fields are considered subak members geertz 1980 a subak is divided into subsubaks which are bounded by natural geographical features and a subsubak is organized by the head of subsubak suradisastra et al 2002 a subak has an organizational structure the head of a subak which is determined in an election is responsible for managing thier organization hafied and gany 2001 norken 2019 while water use is negotiated between farmers between heads of subsubaks and between heads of subaks on a daily basis lorenzen 2006 subak members discuss pivotal water use in periodic subak meetings led by the head of the subak and other board members suradisastra et al 2002 this management system enables a subak to have a single cropping pattern which describes how many rice cultivation cycles it has in a year as well as control water demand and pests lansing and kremer 1993 this harmonized management enables farmers to grow rice up to three times each year however transformation around subaks is currently threatening their productivity the tourism industry and private companies are increasing water demand and farmers increasing engagement in nonfarming jobs is changing the timing of their water use strauss 2011 hired labor is channeled more often into physically intense agricultural tasks such as land preparation and harvesting in harvesting communal labor sharing arrangements were previously used but today harvesting workers consist mainly of seasonal javanese workers lorenzen and lorenzen 2011 2 3 description of the study area in this study five subaks that are located downstream of the saba river in the northern part of bali island indonesia were investigated a map of the study area from 2014 to 2017 appears in fig 1 the heads of five subaks and farmers were interviewed to collect their water management narratives from november 29 to december 7 in 2014 january 20 to february 4 and may 12 27 in 2015 and february 17 28 and september 7 18 in 2016 additionally water flow was monitored from february 21 24 and september 9 and 11 in 2016 to corroborate their accounts and collect quantitative data farmers and harvesting workers were interviewed to collect harvesting information from august 7 12 and december 21 to november 4 in 2017 in all fieldwork respondents answered semistructured questions hereinafter the five subaks are referred to as subaks a b c d and e according to the water allocation order as illustrated on the right hand side of fig 1 subak a is the first subak to use the irrigated water it is located the closest to the source of the irrigation water of the five subaks subak e is the last water recipient it is located at the tail end of the study area the canal system in the study area has two secondary canals in subak a some subsubaks withdraw irrigation water from one of two secondary canals whereas the other subsubaks draw water from the other secondary canal these two groups of subsubaks used water differently from each other depending on the flow of the secondary canals to simplify the unique water management of subak a this paper treats subak a as two subaks termed subak a1 and subak a2 one of the secondary canals supplies water to subak a1 and then to subak b and the other supplies subak a2 subak c subak d and finally subak e consecutively as geertz 1980 elaborated the function of the subak system is to use water resources such as irrigation water and rainfall efficiently fig 2 shows the average monthly rainfall observed in subak a from 2000 to 2011 except for 2008 due to the lack of data these rainfall data were obtained from river basin management organization balai wilayah sungai bali penida after the rainy season starts in october the amount of rainfall increases continuously until february after the amount of rainfall peaks it decreases month by month from march to august in the study area river water is another water resource which is redirected into an irrigation canal by a low head dam an intake weir the daily intake amounts alter with the rainfall as shown the black solid line in fig 3 and decrease in the dry season rice farming during the rainy season as well as continuing to cultivate rice successfully during the dry season necessitates making the most of the annual rainfall thus the first rice cropping season should start with the onset of the rainy season each rice cropping season starts with land preparation which includes the flooding paddling and leveling of paddy fields all of which is done prior to transplanting such land preparation requires massive water for a few weeks on a subak level and therefore corresponds to peak water demand to avoid irrigation water shortages during the land preparation in the study area the heads of four of the subaks all except for subak a asked about the land preparation starting date of the adjacent subaks whose water withdrawal occurred earlier with that knowledge and the ability to predict water availability their starting date of the land preparation stage and intra subak water allocation were discussed in a subak meeting only subak a chose the starting date of its own free will because water use of other subaks was not able to disturb that of subak a which was located closest to the intake weir although the order of water allocation among five subaks existed customarily it was changeable for example in 2017 subak c used water before subak a because subak a agreed with suggestion from subak c it exemplifies that there is room for negotiation as consequence of coordination from 2014 to 2016 the five subaks had mainly double or triple rice cropping table 1 the heads of some subaks claimed that having triple rice cropping was hindered by water scarcity and the prolonged harvesting period the length of the harvesting from in 2014 2017 is given in table 1 growing rice three times a year requires 10 day harvesting but the most of five subaks spent longer time on harvesting in the past the five subaks used communal harvesting workers but such workers nowadays were barely found because high labor intensive work was unpopular with people it resulted in turning to outsourced wage harvesting workers coming from other regencies and islands table 2 lists management practices for rice cultivation observed in the study area for subaks since a year has 52 weeks theoretically two week land preparation period 13 week paddy growth period and two week harvesting period are required to have triple rice cropping 2 4 model development 2 4 1 model description the fieldwork determined that a subak formed a cropping pattern based on the amount of withdrawable irrigation water thereby implying that the cropping pattern reflected the subak s water demand therefore the water allocation mechanism of the study area can be traced from cropping pattern development process to replicate water allocation and examine the influence of harvesting labor an abm was developed to model water management of six subaks subak a1 a2 b c d and e by modifying lansing and kremer model lansing and kremer 1993 in this model one time step equals 10 days and one year equals 36 time steps all values used for calculations are generally averaged over 10 days as shown in table 2 thus triple rice cropping should have two time step land preparation stage nine time step paddy growth stage and one time step harvesting stage agents in this model represent subaks each agent has one annual cropping schedule a cropping schedule contains descriptions of each rice cultivation cycle and the starting date of the first rice cropping season hereinafter the first starting date if a cropping schedule has a rice cultivation cycle or more one rice cultivation cycle consists of three stages the land preparation stage the paddy growth stage and the harvesting stage the model has a total of 158 cropping plans with three different lengths of the land preparation stage a length of the rice growing stage four different lengths of the harvesting stage three different rice cropping intensities and one year fallow as shown in table 2 the minimum durations of land preparation and harvesting are 2 time steps and 1 time step respectively based on a fieldwork result that a subak took more than one month due to the severe water shortage the maximum duration of land preparation is 4 time steps the maximum duration of harvesting is 4 time steps based on table 1 the duration of rice growing is 9 time steps because it was common in the study area initially an agent is randomly provided one of 10 cropping plans consisting of the smallest time steps for land preparation and harvesting and october 1 is set as the first starting date because october is the beginning of the rainy season each agent modifies the cropping schedule to maximize the use of the water supply and meet the demand for water and harvesting labor while following the water management process outlined in table 2 as illustrated in fig 4 while a simulation runs an agent s cropping schedule is evaluated and optimized using the three evaluation steps first the first starting date is optimized according to the land preparation stage paddy growth stage and harvesting stage evaluations the most suitable first starting date is chosen from 36 options october 1 october 10 october 20 november 1 september 20 if the first cropping season pursuits rice cultivation subsequently in the second cropping season the land preparation paddy growth and harvesting stages are evaluated one by one lastly if the second cropping season is rice cultivation the same process as the second rice cropping season is done for the third cropping season 2 4 2 the supply for water and harvesting labor in this model the spatial and hydrological conditions are replicated to model the water supply network of the study area subaks a1 a2 b c d and e are hereinafter referred to as agents a1 a2 b c d and e respectively the characteristics of the agents such as the location and size of the paddy field are similar to that of a subak that an agent represents the hydrological conditions were also created referring to field research results the water allocation ratio between a secondary canal connected to agents a1 and b and a secondary canal connected to agents a2 c d and e was estimated at three to seven based on monitoring results the water supply s water of an agent cubic meters m3 per day is calculated using eqs 1 and 2 1 s water intake rain evapotranspiration consumed water if all upstream

amount withdrawn by up agent x as shown by the orange solid line in fig 3 intake was estimated to be 250 000 m3 day between november and april and 175 000 m3 day between may and october this is because intake from the intake weir fluctuations black solid line were caused by precipitation and canal maintenance because there were normal rainfall patterns these years rain was equal to the average over 10 days of the rainfall data observed in subak a between october 2000 and september 2005 except between october 2002 and september 2003 to exclude erratic rainfall patterns due to el nino southern oscillation table 3 because of the first rice cropping season begins with the start of the rainy season rainfall data begins in october and ends in september the following year table 4 lists

harvesting labor agents demand for water and harvesting labor was determined based on interviews subaks located upstream are able to access water resources more easily than downstream subaks the accessibility of harvesting labor resources is also subject to spatial conditions i e roads markets and locations of worker encampments to reflect these differences equations for water demand and

leveling subsequently such paddy fields need r paddy to nurse and transplant seedlings but another part of the block simultaneously needs nettr lp for paddling and leveling this calculation method cumulatively increases the water requirement for 10 days so that the average water requirement for 10 days underestimates the water requirements of the 10th day 20th day 30th day and 40th day to avoid such underestimations the water requirements of the 10th day 20th day 30th day and 40th day are used as r lp k instead of the average however the water supply for each subak measured in field research was greater than r lp k and r paddy to include water losses caused by conveyance loss and inefficient use water demand was approximated using eq 6 6 d r coeff water rain where d m3 day water demand r

of agents were determined as presented in table 4 the total harvesting labor requirement etr hv of each agent was estimated from field research as shown in table 4 a harvesting worker with a threshing machine can harvest 400 square meters in 8 h note that agents have only harvesting labor requirement unlike water use farmers do not hire workers more than they need 2 4 4 evaluation of land preparation paddy growth and harvesting stages to adjust the cropping schedule evaluating equations for land preparation the paddy growth and the harvesting stages were created the length of the land

combinations the subaks in the study area were seemingly rational and self centeredly attempted to maximize their annual rice production and subak a and the other subaks had different characteristics this condition can be translated into a noncooperative game of two players supposing player 1 is agent a1 and a2 and player 2 is agent b c d and e on the subak level when paddy becomes ready to be harvested a rice cultivation subsequently enters the harvesting stage it suggests that harvesting labor allocation order is similar to the water allocation order because water allocation order results from cooperative adjusting behavior among downstream subaks the existing harvesting labor allocation order can be considered as a consequence of cooperative behavior although subaks follow long lasting cooperative water management practices the cooperative resources allocation may not be outweighed in the future currently individual farmers need to handle with harvesting however because of economies of scale a subak with the larger paddy fields may become easier to collect harvesting labor resource this condition will allocate harvesting labor supply un cooperatively in the area based on this projection the noncooperative game was formulated two players of this game have the cooperative strategy and the noncooperative strategy which hereinafter are denoted as cs and ns respectively the strategy combination is written for example cs ns when player 1 chooses the cooperative strategy and player 2 chooses the noncooperative strategy and all strategy combinations are cs cs cs ns ns cs and ns ns when a player chooses the cooperative strategy the order of harvesting labor allocation among agents of such a player is determined by distance from the weir an agent closest to the weir is allowed to gain harvesting labor supply first and the second turn goes to an agent which is the second closest to the weir an agent recognizes its turn after the prior agent gains when one player chooses the noncooperative strategy the order of harvesting labor allocation among agents of such a player is determined by the paddy field size an agent possessing largest paddy fields is allowed to access to harvesting labor supply first and the second turn goes to an agent with the second largest sizes if two agents have the same paddy field sizes an agent closer to the weir has the prior turn than the other if the arrangements mentioned above cannot specify which agent is prior to the other the prior turn is given to an agent closer to the weir for example when it is cs ns agents a1 and a2 have the cooperative strategy and agents b to e have the noncooperative strategy between agents a1 and d agent a1 is closer to the weir than agent d thus agent a1 gains before agent d these four orders of harvesting labor allocation and the order of water allocation are illustrated in fig 5 contrary to harvesting labor allocation this game has the only one order of water allocation as described in fig 5 agents a1 and a2 first withdraw at once followed by secondary agents b and c then by agent d and at the end agent e to understand influence of harvesting labor supply on water management three harvesting labor scenarios of all labor scenarios were named scenarios 1 2 and 3 scenario 1 has 760 harvesting workers which allows the six agents to harvest simultaneously in 10 days scenario 2 has 228 harvesting workers which satisfies 30 of the requirement for simultaneous 10 day harvesting or 89 of the requirement for simultaneous 30 day harvesting scenario 3 has 86 harvesting workers which satisfies 11 of the requirement for simultaneous 10 day harvesting or 45 of the requirement for simultaneous 40 day harvesting in another way 86 harvesting workers are the minimal requirement for 30 day harvesting of agent a2 whose paddy fields are the largest among all agents in this study simulations of a strategy combination ran with three harvesting labor scenarios until each cropping schedule of the agents converged while four year rainfall data table 3 were iteratively utilized as rain a strategy combination with a scenario ran 100 times and results such as annual rice production the number of days of the stages were averaged for analysis the annual rice productions of strategy combinations were compared and four strategy combinations in a scenario were evaluated using two concepts pareto optimality and the nash equilibrium table 5 a strategy combination is pareto optimal if no other strategy combination exists where one player can do better without decreasing annual rice production of the other often it generates the largest total annual rice production among four strategy combinations or provides at least one of the players with the highest annual rice production among four strategy combinations a strategy combination is a nash equilibrium if both players make the best choice to generate the highest annual rice production based on their belief in this model water use behavior of the agents aims to maximize the annual rice production in the study area the rice yield was determined mainly by how much rainfall and irrigation water were obtained as fig 2 shows after the rainy season peaks the amount of rainfall decreased month by month and thus as shown in fig 3 the volume of the intake weir decreased in the dry season because of this rainfall pattern the later that the rice cropping season starts the less rainfall and irrigation water such a rice cropping season receives this can cause a decline in annual rice production this study s model replicates this relationship between the rainfall pattern and rice production 3 results 3 1 the current resource allocation based on field research results the ideal cropping schedule in the model is triple rice cropping consisting of oct 1st as the first starting date 2 time step land preparation and 1 time step harvesting as shown table 2 in the formulation of this noncooperative game cs cs is the current resource allocation to examine simulation outcomes of cs cs the cropping schedules of six agents in three harvesting labor scenarios were compared with the ideal cropping schedule abm is designed to imitate the existing water allocation of the study area emerging from subaks cropping schedule development process in this model agents have the cropping schedule development process listed in table 2 and cropping schedules are decided by rainfall withdrawn river water and harvesting labor conditions because hydrological conditions such as rainfall and the intake weir of the model are similar to the status quo with sufficient harvesting labor upstream agents such as agents a1 and b can have the ideal cropping schedule whereas downstream agents such as agents d and e may have a double or single rice cropping schedule among downstream agents because the water supply is lower than that of the previous agent an agent would be required to set the first starting date later and or extend the duration of the land preparation and the harvesting stage downstream agents such as agent e who are at the tail end of the water supply network may exhibit significant difference in the number of days between the simulation outcome and the ideal cropping schedule in fig 6 the stacked bar graph shows differences in the number of days between the simulation outcomes and the ideal cropping schedule and the line graph shows the annual rice production of three harvesting labor scenarios in scenario 1 harvesting labor supply was sufficient for all six agents whereas it was not in scenarios 2 and 3 the outcomes of scenario 1 demonstrate that upstream agents such as agents a1 and b had the ideal cropping schedule and that downstream agents such as agents a2 c d and e set the first starting date later than the previous agent agent e had a longer time for land preparation stage than agent d these results indicate that the abm of this study replicated the water allocation mechanism of the study area appropriately when harvesting labor supply was insufficient compared with the ideal cropping schedule overall the first starting date was set later and the harvesting took longer whereas the length of the land preparation had little change this tendency results from the cropping schedule development process as represented by fig 4 the harvesting stage is evaluated at the end in the process of adjusting a rice cultivation cycle thus the existing cropping schedule development process tends to extend the duration of the harvesting stage rather than the land preparation stage decrease in the annual rice production happened when the harvesting needed more time than the previous scenario this change was observed in agents b c d and e except agent a2 agent a2 had the same rice production even though double cropping schedules varied in each harvesting scenario this indicates that a cropping schedule was determined by hydrological condition and the availability of labor resource in the next section harvesting labor allocation and rice production are evaluated 3 2 impact of strategy combinations on annual rice production table 6 lists annual rice production for four strategy combinations in three harvesting labor scenarios table 7 lists strategy combinations that are pareto optimal or have a nash equilibrium in scenario 1 in which sufficient harvesting labor was provided the game did not have a nash equilibrium and ns ns was pareto optimal this result means that ns ns provides optimally high annual rice production but it may not be chosen because it is not nash equilibrium in scenario 2 which featured limited harvesting labor ns ns was the unique nash equilibrium and cs cs cs ns and ns ns were all pareto optimal ns ns in this scenario will be stably chosen because it is one of the pareto optimal outcomes and nash equilibrium as well in scenario 3 which featured scarce harvesting labor ns ns was the unique nash equilibrium and cs cs and ns ns were pareto optimal like scenario 2 ns ns will be consistently the best choice in an individual player s perspective table 6 shows that player 1 did not have a strictly dominant strategy in any scenarios whereas for player 2 noncooperation was the strictly dominant strategy in all three scenarios this reasons that cs cs won t be a solution in three scenarios as the harvesting labor supply decreased annual rice production declined whichever strategy combinations were chosen for sustainable irrigation facilities and water cooperative water use is ideal in scenarios 1 and 2 the difference in annual rice production between cs cs and the others was within 5 in scenario 3 the difference in annual rice production between cs cs and ns cs or ns ns was within 3 whereas between cs cs and cs ns it was 17 this suggests that using cooperative resource use especially harvesting labor resource has little negative impact on annual rice production to explore the impact of various strategy combinations on annual rice production for three scenarios the seasonal rice production of cs cs cs ns ns cs and ns ns of each agent is compared in fig 7 in scenario 1 fig 7a differences of strategy combinations did not change rice cropping intensity of all the agents but slightly changed the occurrence rate of triple rice cropping of agent d due to water shortage it caused a negligible variation in the total rice production among four strategy combinations in scenario 2 fig 7b the position in the harvesting labor allocation order mattered to the third cropping season of agent d in cs ns unlike the other strategy combinations agent d which had the second position in the harvesting labor allocation order had triple rice cropping in some occurrences of 100 iterations under that condition agent e could have the maximum yield in the second rice cropping season however agent a2 whose paddy fields were the largest of all agents had the second latest position in the harvesting labor allocation order because of their inferior position and limited shortage in the harvesting labor supply agent a2 was unable to have a second rice cropping season an increase in the annual rice production of agents d and e surpassed the decline in rice production of agent a2 and cs ns became the most prolific strategic combination however differences in the total annual rice production among pareto optimal outcomes were minor in scenario 3 fig 7c cs cs was one of the pareto optimal outcomes ns ns was the unique nash equilibrium and a pareto optimal outcome and cs ns generated the lowest total annual rice production a noticeable difference between cs cs and ns ns was that either agent a1 or b had a triple rice cropping pattern the two agents paddy fields were similar in size and smaller than those of other four agents this similarity generates a marginal difference in annual rice production between cs cs and ns ns as shown in table 6 in cs ns the severe harvesting labor supply shortage prevented agents d and e from enjoying their positional advantage as they did in scenario 2 and agent a2 was unable to have a second rice cropping season moreover agent a2 s lower cropping intensity did not provide the other agents a sufficient harvesting labor supply to increase rice cropping intensity due to the harvesting labor allocation order these conditions caused a significant difference in the annual rice production between cs ns and the other strategy combinations this indicates that with a severe harvesting labor supply shortage a harvesting labor allocation order could compound declines in annual rice production 4 discussion 4 1 implication of strategy combinations for a resolving water related conflict this study employed noncooperative game theory approach to draw insights from rice cultivation management practices identified by stakeholder analysis approach madani 2010 in the game a nash equilibrium reveals a strategy combination that the players believe is the best choice for yielding high annual rice production and thus such a strategy combination is more than likely to be chosen as a solution a pareto optimal outcome reveals a strategy combination that is the most productive for the entire area in all scenarios of this game the noncooperative strategy was strictly dominant for player 2 which consists of downstream agents such as agents b c d and e it means that in all scenarios possible outcomes were only ns ns and cs ns when the harvesting labor supply was sufficient e g scenario 1 a nash equilibrium did not exist and a pareto optimal outcome was ns ns in this scenario annual rice cultivation of player 1 which consists of upstream agents such as agents a1 and a2 was the same in the four strategy combinations if player 1 is unconcerned about the entire area both cs and ns are their choices and the annual rice production of player 2 will depend on player 1 s decision it represents a water conflict structure observed in the irrigation system outcomes of downstream agents vary depending on upstream agents while upstream agents can have consistently a desirable outcome with any strategies when the harvesting labor supply was insufficient e g scenarios 2 and 3 ns ns was the unique nash equilibrium and pareto optimal the non cooperative strategy was the best for player 1 and 2 and the entire area as well whereas although cs cs was a pareto optimal outcome in scenarios 2 and 3 it would never happen because of player 2 to make cs cs is a solution for this game the cooperative strategy needs to be more beneficial for player 2 in actual management downstream subaks such as subaks b c d and e choose the cooperative strategy from the perspective of both individual subaks and the entire study area an analysis of strategy combinations suggests that current rice cultivation management practices may not be devised to maximize rice production rather management practices could be designed to maintain conditional cooperative relationships between subaks this is supported by the field research results like other subak systems lorenzen 2006 subaks in the study area sometimes informally negotiate water use timing and when both sides agree they diverge from management practices to help each other such cooperative relationships should be beneficial for all subaks although they are conditional because irrigated rice production relies heavily on rainfall with patterns that change every year in addition to the erratic climate increasing reliance on outsourced harvesting labor and a shortage of harvesting workers make the duration of harvesting more unpredictable such tight interactions between subaks could also play a role in mutual monitoring ostrom 1990 to indirectly facilitate more efficient water use and sustain multiple rice cultivation each year therefore flexible management practices with room for negotiation could contribute to strengthening cooperative relationships as well as the resilience of irrigation water management systems farmers still embrace balinese hindu philosophy called tri hita karana to maintain traditional rice cultivation systems norken 2019 however as tourism and other nonfarming jobs develop further rice cultivation will change more and the value held by farmers in cultivating rice will be less lorenzen and lorenzen 2011 strauss 2011 the model of this study simply incorporated the harvesting process but it was enough to project that the shortage of harvesting labor supply could accelerate noncooperative behavior among farmers and consequently rice production of the entire area could decrease further research on harvesting labor supply systems is required to better understand harvesting labor supply impact on rice cultivation 4 2 insight into the sustainability of irrigation water management the model outcomes described that resources for rice production such as rainfall withdrawn river water and harvesting labor were consumed by users aligned along a main canal this points out that a user s resource consumption influenced that of the following users additionally water users in irrigated paddy fields formed a cropping schedule to fit their resource use into supply variability this indicates that the process to create a cropping schedule was an adaptation to hydrological and demographic changes this cropping schedule development process was similar to kuil et al 2018 their model showed that an equilibrium cropping pattern emerged from water availability perceived by farmers they concluded that wuas water use represented the adaptability to external conditions such as climate change in the study area of this study resources allocation practices strengthened cooperative relationships between subaks a and subaks b to e which was more important than resource use efficiency for rice productivity this study focuses on the influence of transitioning from a communal to an outsourced harvesting labor supply and simulation outcomes indicate that the noncooperative strategy for collecting harvesting labor was more beneficial especially for downstream subaks however currently upstream and downstream subaks seemed to have the cooperative strategy while downstream subaks such as subaks d and e complained about subak a s indifference to downstream subaks leaving the status quo would lead to a severer water conflict or abandoned paddy fields among downstream farmers this expectation is not a negligible event for indonesia striving for food security world food programme 2022 subak systems which is a special type of pim systems in bali indonesia have developed tight cooperative relationships by for example exchanged labor custom for centuries lorenzen and lorenzen 2011 talhelm and english 2020 however their management is getting less cooperative because of outsourced harvesting labor in bali to change their resources allocation system to be beneficial for the entire area new cooperative relationship needs to be built up the heads of the subaks were aware that the harvesting stage took longer than before but none attempted to implement any countermeasures against the harvesting labor shortage this result confirms prior studies subak systems only regulate the water supply geertz 1980 even if farmers tried to cooperatively manage harvesting this is no longer a community level issue because harvesting workers migrate between districts regencies and islands this is therefore a larger issue between bali and other islands and between the rice and labor industries another issue threatening the sustainability of balinese rice cultivation is climate change since rice production is likely to decrease as a result takama et al 2017 this encourages farmers to establish new water use strategies to maintain rice production despite rainfall patterns change notably these two urgent issues are both social issues berkes 2017 to cope with the social issues impacting irrigation water management balinese farmers need to transform subak systems using flexible water allocation management practices as shown this paper balinese farmers can develop new management systems adaptive to social change however farmers will need to work with other communities local and national authorities and other industries to address social issues this suggests that sustainable rice cultivation in bali will require government intervention to solve social issues the government can manage allocation of migrant harvesting workers to proceed harvesting efficiently additionally agricultural and infrastructure improvements undertaken in japan and south korea show that the governmental contribution to for example subsidies for agricultural machinery introduction land consolidation and drainage improvement for agricultural machinery utilization and road construction for eliminating travel time and transporting agricultural machinery can help improve resource use efficiency as well im et al 2016 koshiyama 2019 balinese irrigation systems have a government assisted federation so called subak gede lorenzen and lorenzen 2005 subak gede is a coordination agency for multiple subaks sharing an irritation infrastructure to aim for better irrigation management on a large area the study area also had subak gede but the heads of the subaks considered it was more nominal the results of this study indicate that the cooperative strategy for harvesting labor allocation was the most productive for the entire area under severe harvesting labor shortage because farmers still values rice cultivation keeping the cooperative strategy would be attractive under subak gede subaks can discuss about sharing limited harvesting labor supply as access to the governmental help such as information on labor and subsidies for harvesting machinery governmental support can improve resources allocation through changing cropping schedule development process more adaptive to the issues that subaks are confronting this study shows that abm and game theory are useful to develop water allocation scenarios based on the state quo whose land use climatic and demographic conditions are changing although the model outcomes themselves did not explain what motivation downstream subaks had to choose the cooperative strategy by analyzing the model outcomes the status quo scenario was able to be evaluated when government intervention installs infrastructure and or rules for resource allocation in the future the model can be used to propose the most efficient resource allocation plans to achieve their goal finding motivation of downstream subaks to choose the cooperative strategy will help researchers understand farmers values leading to cooperative behavior for better understanding of the study area agents need to include not only subaks but also other entities such as the local government and labor market to estimate the future rice production more accurately the model should be run with rainfall projections 5 conclusions water related conflict in the irrigation sector has been compounded with climate change and population dynamics although irrigation management transfer imt and participatory irrigation management pim have been implemented to achieve sustainable irrigation infrastructure management pim imt studies have found that institutional arrangement has issues to resolve conflicts between water users associations wuas agent based model is used to analyze conflicts and game theory is employed to analyze rules and practices found in places where conflicts existed this study discussed the applicability of abm and game theory to analyze conflicts over surface irrigation water and harvesting labor and proposed transforming resource supply system to resolve water related conflicts increased by resource depletion under urbanization as a case study of successful pim implementations subak balinese wuas was chosen the simulation outcomes indicate that abm can replicate the water allocation mechanism and social issues such as harvesting labor supply could compound the decrease in rice productivity from an analysis of strategy combinations we determined that flexible rice cultivation management practices afforded room for negotiation and should contribute to strengthening the cooperative relationships between subaks however as the society changes rice cultivation is losing its value held by farmers in bali thus as the analysis indicates farmers behavior may become noncooperative to maintain cooperative relationships between wuas threatened by the pressure of social changes this study also established that governmental intervention will be necessary to control island level social conditions because social issues are seemingly beyond the capability of subak systems to control to efficiently use resources decreased by social changes subak will need to build new cooperative relationships and mechanization and modernization of irrigation systems will be inevitable to improve resource use efficiency abm and game theory can help acknowledge social changes affecting production and support discussions by providing an analysis result of resource allocation rules and scenarios for better understanding of conflicts found in piim imt studies in socio hydrological approach influencing resources on water supply and demand such as labor land fertilizer and agricultural machinery should be investigated funding this work was supported by grants in aid for

9254,in the irrigation sector water related conflict has been compounded due to social issues such as climate change and urbanization induced population dynamics although irrigation management transfer imt and participatory irrigation management pim were implemented for sustainable irrigation infrastructure management results of pim imt implementations exhibit conflicts between wuas and the lack of water users associations wuas participation in management to unfold pim imt issues agent based model abm helps analyze conflicts and game theory helps analyze governing concepts underlying cooperative management such as rules this study discusses the applicability of abm and game theory to analyze conflicts over surface irrigation water and harvesting labor and also aims to present solutions to increasing conflicts due to labor resource depletion owning to urbanization to investigate cooperative wuas amid the pressure of social changes we chose wuas in bali indonesia known as subaks rice cultivation management practices of five subaks in the study area were identified by stakeholder analysis approach and we developed an abm to model water management of six agents representing subaks to examine influence of harvesting labor supply on water management noncooperative game theory was applied and three harvesting labor scenarios and two strategies were generated scenario analysis indicates that with severe shortages in the harvesting labor supply harvesting labor allocation orders could compound the decline in annual rice production this study also establishes that although current management practices maintain cooperative relationships between subaks and flexible management practices likely strengthen cooperative relationships social changes could accelerate farmers noncooperative behavior to resolve conflicts subaks need to develop cooperative relationships on a larger scale but social issues go beyond the intra community level and will require government intervention to efficiently use deceasing resource supply this method using abm and game theory will contribute to the development of socio hydrological analysis approach to sustainable resource allocation in pim imt study keywords participatory irrigation management water conflict harvesting labor subak socio hydrology sustainability 1 introduction water related conflict in the irrigation sector has been evolving owning to population growth and increased food consumption the available water supply is reaching its limit in satisfying water demand steduto et al 2012 to resolve conflict over irrigation water and promote food security the irrigation sector which uses 70 of the total withdrawn freshwater globally must improve water use efficiency fao 2020 however water conflict has been more complicated because of climate change rice growing regions such as south east asia and eastern africa must adapt to delays in rainy reason onset and increase in floods droughts and rainfall variability and intensity adhikari et al 2015 sekhar 2018 unprecedented climate change and urbanization induced population dynamics can cause water related conflicts in rice farming exchanged labor is commonly used talhelm and english 2020 but due to the population leaving rural areas and migrating to cities agricultural labor structure has been transforming which can cause conflicts over labor and thus impact water use the irrigation sector must develop measures to resolve conflict to promote sustainable irrigation water use for sustainable irrigation infrastructure management irrigation management transfer imt was implemented targeting management transfer from the government sector to the private sector through water users associations wuas after negative results on management were exposed worldwide garces restrepo et al 2007 vermillion 1997 the world bank proposed participatory irrigation management pim pim emphasizes users involvement and aims to utilize local knowledge regarding efficient water use and irrigation facility management ishii and satoh 2003 groenfeldt 2000 however a comparative analysis of pim imt implementation indicates a mixture of positive and negative results about regarding the fairness of water allocation irrigation performance financial management productivity and environmental sustainability mukherji et al 2009 senanayake et al 2015 vermillion 1997 based on these findings the irrigation sector has realized that human aspects of water resource management require more attention jones 1995 steinberg 1983 water resource management has been widely studied in terms of socio ecological systems which comprise local ecosystem and management practices akamani 2016 colding and barthel 2019 downard et al 2014 merrill et al 2018 ostrom 2009 rathwell and peterson 2012 studies on hydrological conditions has evolved into socio hydrology in recent years kuil et al 2018 pouladi et al 2019 to understand institutional arrangements the stakeholder analysis approach has been used in pim imt studies belay and bewket 2013 ghumman et al 2014 maleza and nishimura 2007 reed et al 2009 researchers often discovered insufficient wua capacity gany et al 2019 ricks 2016 and the need for greater governmental commitment to improve participatory water management which includes implementing reform policies to support institutional wua establishment increasing farmers participation in management activities and clarifying the roles of wuas and the government garces restrepo et al 2007 hamada and samad 2011 johnson et al 2020 musa 2009 shindo and yamamoto 2017 singh et al 2014 to give insights regarding these findings agent based model abm and game theory can be employed abm helps analyze conflicts among water users over water use abm has been increasingly used to examine whether an observed phenomenon that stakeholders and hydrological conditions create can be described by decision making processes identified by the stakeholder analysis approach to predict future conditions such as water allocation janssen and ostrom 2006 in abm agents representing stakeholders such as farmers and government agencies make decisions regarding the use of natural resources while interacting with other agents to exchange information such as water use under hydrological conditions lansing and kremer 1993 explained the efficiency of the existing water use coordination scale among wuas in a watershed using abm abm was also applied to a small scale irrigation system to examine the efficiency of the existing water withdrawal arrangements and the system s vulnerability to projected rainfall changes caused by climate change cifdaloz et al 2010 pérez et al 2016 water use regulation scenarios of irrigation systems were tested to prevent groundwater depletion anbari et al 2021 castilla rho et al 2015 and analyze the impact on irrigation and aquaculture schluter and pahl wostl 2007 the integration of land use change and climate change scenarios forecasts an increase in water scarcity huber et al 2021 shahpari et al 2021 predicted land use change based on farmers behavior with regard to crop selection and irrigation expansion abm is applicable for examining conflicts by analyzing emerged tangible phenomena which helps comprehend the findings revealed by pim imt studies such as unsuccessful cost reduction and ill maintained infrastructure management nonetheless to resolve pim imt issues concepts underlying phenomena such as establishments institutional arrangements practices rules customary laws and their necessity must be analyzed moreover the resolution of the issues can also be achieved by the application of game theory game theory has two forms noncooperative and cooperative games noncooperative games assume that water users individually and competitively make decisions to maximize their gain whereas cooperative games assume that water users make decisions collaboratively for water management resource problems although noncooperative games can be employed because they do not require quantitative information cooperative game theory has been applied more often because the results of cost benefit allocation issues are more understandable madani 2010 in previous studies noncooperative game theory was used to resolve water allocation problems between multiple regions tian et al 2019 between different sectors mehrparvar et al 2020 and within a basin lv et al 2019 the cooperative game theory has been applied to finding efficient and equitable water allocation in a basin han et al 2018 and to resolving a water cost allocation problem sechi et al 2013 other studies have compared the outcomes of noncooperative and cooperative game theories to identify the best water management approach for sustainable exploitation of water resources chew et al 2009 digna et al 2018 in the irrigation sector getirana and malta 2010 examined various strategies to resolve irrigation water conflict among sugarcane farmers using gmcr other studies used noncooperative game theory and created a payoff matrix to explain the reason behind pim failing in terms of irrigation fee collection hone et al 2020 institutional arrangements of groundwater have been investigated using a cooperative game theory approach kahil et al 2016 and by comparing noncooperative and cooperative game theories madani and dinar 2012 studies indicate that game theory is useful for analyzing resource allocation such as land water and labor force in the irrigation sector although game theory has been applied to examine groundwater irrigation issues few studies have been conducted that consider surface water such as paddy irrigation podimata and yannopoulos 2015 unlike groundwater depletion which influences all stakeholders water use the overexploitation of surface water resources has a greater influence on downstream users than upstream users the unequal impact on stakeholders discourages some of them from joining the discussion on cooperative management pathways to resolve water conflicts cannot always be deduced using the cooperative game theory approach rather as pim imt studies have shown the difficulty in establishing cooperative and sustainable water management and water resource management often depends on noncooperative game theory conflicts between surface water users in an irrigation system are observed within existing wuas recent wuas established by imt implementations have issues such as water theft and incompliance with rules among users unfolding development paths of rules in use value of rules in use and benefits of conflict management to wuas will contribute to resolving conflicts arising from imt issues and serve pim improvement therefore this study discusses the applicability of abm and game theory to analyze conflicts over surface irrigation water and labor it also aims to present solutions to conflicts that have increased due to labor resource depletion owning to urbanization this paper is organized as follows first irrigation management systems in the study area are described this section also touches on social change occurring around rice cultivation systems in bali subsequently the application of abm and game theory are described after the simulation results are presented the implications of cooperative and noncooperative strategy combinations and suggestions for the sustainability of irrigation water allocation under social changes are discussed the final section concludes the paper 2 material and methods 2 1 need for a case study pim imt implementations have been found to be successful globally in places where prior to pim imt implementation irrigation infrastructures existed wuas were established and rules for sharing irrigation water were developed in even successful pim imt cases the fairness and efficiency of water allocation seems to be affected by urbanization and climate change to study a successful pim case amid the pressure of urbanization this paper chooses a long enduring type of wua known as a subak subak is a term used to denote balinese wuas which are recognized as a successful pim case united states general accounting office 1983 using the subak as a case study this paper examines how subaks adapt to seasonal water supply decline on a subak level and whether water allocation stems from subaks cooperative behavior 2 2 balinese water management and social transformation around rice cultivation systems the supposed subak system is a centuries old traditional irrigation system in bali indonesia the system is tightly connected to the balinese hindu philosophy of harmony between the spirituality people and nature hafied and gany 2001 and is used in balinese rice cultivation its main role is to regulate the water supply a subak consists of all paddy fields irrigated from a single water source such as a dam or a canal and all farmers using these fields are considered subak members geertz 1980 a subak is divided into subsubaks which are bounded by natural geographical features and a subsubak is organized by the head of subsubak suradisastra et al 2002 a subak has an organizational structure the head of a subak which is determined in an election is responsible for managing thier organization hafied and gany 2001 norken 2019 while water use is negotiated between farmers between heads of subsubaks and between heads of subaks on a daily basis lorenzen 2006 subak members discuss pivotal water use in periodic subak meetings led by the head of the subak and other board members suradisastra et al 2002 this management system enables a subak to have a single cropping pattern which describes how many rice cultivation cycles it has in a year as well as control water demand and pests lansing and kremer 1993 this harmonized management enables farmers to grow rice up to three times each year however transformation around subaks is currently threatening their productivity the tourism industry and private companies are increasing water demand and farmers increasing engagement in nonfarming jobs is changing the timing of their water use strauss 2011 hired labor is channeled more often into physically intense agricultural tasks such as land preparation and harvesting in harvesting communal labor sharing arrangements were previously used but today harvesting workers consist mainly of seasonal javanese workers lorenzen and lorenzen 2011 2 3 description of the study area in this study five subaks that are located downstream of the saba river in the northern part of bali island indonesia were investigated a map of the study area from 2014 to 2017 appears in fig 1 the heads of five subaks and farmers were interviewed to collect their water management narratives from november 29 to december 7 in 2014 january 20 to february 4 and may 12 27 in 2015 and february 17 28 and september 7 18 in 2016 additionally water flow was monitored from february 21 24 and september 9 and 11 in 2016 to corroborate their accounts and collect quantitative data farmers and harvesting workers were interviewed to collect harvesting information from august 7 12 and december 21 to november 4 in 2017 in all fieldwork respondents answered semistructured questions hereinafter the five subaks are referred to as subaks a b c d and e according to the water allocation order as illustrated on the right hand side of fig 1 subak a is the first subak to use the irrigated water it is located the closest to the source of the irrigation water of the five subaks subak e is the last water recipient it is located at the tail end of the study area the canal system in the study area has two secondary canals in subak a some subsubaks withdraw irrigation water from one of two secondary canals whereas the other subsubaks draw water from the other secondary canal these two groups of subsubaks used water differently from each other depending on the flow of the secondary canals to simplify the unique water management of subak a this paper treats subak a as two subaks termed subak a1 and subak a2 one of the secondary canals supplies water to subak a1 and then to subak b and the other supplies subak a2 subak c subak d and finally subak e consecutively as geertz 1980 elaborated the function of the subak system is to use water resources such as irrigation water and rainfall efficiently fig 2 shows the average monthly rainfall observed in subak a from 2000 to 2011 except for 2008 due to the lack of data these rainfall data were obtained from river basin management organization balai wilayah sungai bali penida after the rainy season starts in october the amount of rainfall increases continuously until february after the amount of rainfall peaks it decreases month by month from march to august in the study area river water is another water resource which is redirected into an irrigation canal by a low head dam an intake weir the daily intake amounts alter with the rainfall as shown the black solid line in fig 3 and decrease in the dry season rice farming during the rainy season as well as continuing to cultivate rice successfully during the dry season necessitates making the most of the annual rainfall thus the first rice cropping season should start with the onset of the rainy season each rice cropping season starts with land preparation which includes the flooding paddling and leveling of paddy fields all of which is done prior to transplanting such land preparation requires massive water for a few weeks on a subak level and therefore corresponds to peak water demand to avoid irrigation water shortages during the land preparation in the study area the heads of four of the subaks all except for subak a asked about the land preparation starting date of the adjacent subaks whose water withdrawal occurred earlier with that knowledge and the ability to predict water availability their starting date of the land preparation stage and intra subak water allocation were discussed in a subak meeting only subak a chose the starting date of its own free will because water use of other subaks was not able to disturb that of subak a which was located closest to the intake weir although the order of water allocation among five subaks existed customarily it was changeable for example in 2017 subak c used water before subak a because subak a agreed with suggestion from subak c it exemplifies that there is room for negotiation as consequence of coordination from 2014 to 2016 the five subaks had mainly double or triple rice cropping table 1 the heads of some subaks claimed that having triple rice cropping was hindered by water scarcity and the prolonged harvesting period the length of the harvesting from in 2014 2017 is given in table 1 growing rice three times a year requires 10 day harvesting but the most of five subaks spent longer time on harvesting in the past the five subaks used communal harvesting workers but such workers nowadays were barely found because high labor intensive work was unpopular with people it resulted in turning to outsourced wage harvesting workers coming from other regencies and islands table 2 lists management practices for rice cultivation observed in the study area for subaks since a year has 52 weeks theoretically two week land preparation period 13 week paddy growth period and two week harvesting period are required to have triple rice cropping 2 4 model development 2 4 1 model description the fieldwork determined that a subak formed a cropping pattern based on the amount of withdrawable irrigation water thereby implying that the cropping pattern reflected the subak s water demand therefore the water allocation mechanism of the study area can be traced from cropping pattern development process to replicate water allocation and examine the influence of harvesting labor an abm was developed to model water management of six subaks subak a1 a2 b c d and e by modifying lansing and kremer model lansing and kremer 1993 in this model one time step equals 10 days and one year equals 36 time steps all values used for calculations are generally averaged over 10 days as shown in table 2 thus triple rice cropping should have two time step land preparation stage nine time step paddy growth stage and one time step harvesting stage agents in this model represent subaks each agent has one annual cropping schedule a cropping schedule contains descriptions of each rice cultivation cycle and the starting date of the first rice cropping season hereinafter the first starting date if a cropping schedule has a rice cultivation cycle or more one rice cultivation cycle consists of three stages the land preparation stage the paddy growth stage and the harvesting stage the model has a total of 158 cropping plans with three different lengths of the land preparation stage a length of the rice growing stage four different lengths of the harvesting stage three different rice cropping intensities and one year fallow as shown in table 2 the minimum durations of land preparation and harvesting are 2 time steps and 1 time step respectively based on a fieldwork result that a subak took more than one month due to the severe water shortage the maximum duration of land preparation is 4 time steps the maximum duration of harvesting is 4 time steps based on table 1 the duration of rice growing is 9 time steps because it was common in the study area initially an agent is randomly provided one of 10 cropping plans consisting of the smallest time steps for land preparation and harvesting and october 1 is set as the first starting date because october is the beginning of the rainy season each agent modifies the cropping schedule to maximize the use of the water supply and meet the demand for water and harvesting labor while following the water management process outlined in table 2 as illustrated in fig 4 while a simulation runs an agent s cropping schedule is evaluated and optimized using the three evaluation steps first the first starting date is optimized according to the land preparation stage paddy growth stage and harvesting stage evaluations the most suitable first starting date is chosen from 36 options october 1 october 10 october 20 november 1 september 20 if the first cropping season pursuits rice cultivation subsequently in the second cropping season the land preparation paddy growth and harvesting stages are evaluated one by one lastly if the second cropping season is rice cultivation the same process as the second rice cropping season is done for the third cropping season 2 4 2 the supply for water and harvesting labor in this model the spatial and hydrological conditions are replicated to model the water supply network of the study area subaks a1 a2 b c d and e are hereinafter referred to as agents a1 a2 b c d and e respectively the characteristics of the agents such as the location and size of the paddy field are similar to that of a subak that an agent represents the hydrological conditions were also created referring to field research results the water allocation ratio between a secondary canal connected to agents a1 and b and a secondary canal connected to agents a2 c d and e was estimated at three to seven based on monitoring results the water supply s water of an agent cubic meters m3 per day is calculated using eqs 1 and 2 1 s water intake rain evapotranspiration consumed water if all upstream agents up agent 1 up agent 2 up agent x 2 consumed water w up agent 1 w up agent 2 w up agent x where intake m3 day the intake water volume at the intake weir rain m3 day rainfall received in an agent s paddy fields evapotranspiation m3 day evapotranspiration from an agent s paddy field consumed water m3 day the total water amount withdrawn by all upstream agents and w up agent x m3 day water amount withdrawn by up agent x as shown by the orange solid line in fig 3 intake was estimated to be 250 000 m3 day between november and april and 175 000 m3 day between may and october this is because intake from the intake weir fluctuations black solid line were caused by precipitation and canal maintenance because there were normal rainfall patterns these years rain was equal to the average over 10 days of the rainfall data observed in subak a between october 2000 and september 2005 except between october 2002 and september 2003 to exclude erratic rainfall patterns due to el nino southern oscillation table 3 because of the first rice cropping season begins with the start of the rainy season rainfall data begins in october and ends in september the following year table 4 lists the numerical value range and formula of the variables used in these and subsequent equations the harvesting labor supply s hv of an agent workers is calculated using eqs 3 and 4 3 s hv all labor

note that the water supply s water is withdrawable irrigation amounts and the harvesting labor supply s hv is number of hirable harvesting workers for an agent 2 4 3 the demand for water and harvesting labor agents demand for water and harvesting labor was determined based on interviews subaks located upstream are able to access water resources more easily than downstream subaks the accessibility of harvesting labor resources is also subject to spatial conditions i e roads markets and locations of worker encampments to reflect these differences equations for water demand and requirement and harvesting labor requirement were specified as follows water is necessary in the land preparation and paddy growth stages water requirement during the land preparation stage is calculated using eq 5 mastui 2021 5 r lp k 10 a n lp nettr lp r paddy k 1 where r lp k m3 day water requirement on the k th time step in the land preparation stage k time step time step number in the land preparation stage n lp time steps the total time steps in the land preparation stage a ha paddy field size nettr lp mm stage the total water requirement in the land preparation stage and r paddy mm day water requirement in the paddy growth stage eq 5 is used to calculate the water requirement of an entire paddy field block of an agent a part of the block only needs nettr lp for paddling and leveling subsequently such paddy fields need r paddy to nurse and transplant seedlings but another part of the block simultaneously needs nettr lp for paddling and leveling this calculation method cumulatively increases the water requirement for 10 days so that the average water requirement for 10 days underestimates the water requirements of the 10th day 20th day 30th day and 40th day to avoid such underestimations the water requirements of the 10th day 20th day 30th day and 40th day are used as r lp k instead of the average however the water supply for each subak measured in field research was greater than r lp k and r paddy to include water losses caused by conveyance loss and inefficient use water demand was approximated using eq 6 6 d r coeff water rain where d m3 day water demand r m3 day water requirement and coeff water efficiency coefficient of the water allocation from monitoring results demonstrating that the water supply varied from subak to subak the values of coeff water of agents were determined as presented in table 4 the total harvesting labor requirement etr hv of each agent was estimated from field research as shown in table 4 a harvesting worker with a threshing machine can harvest 400 square meters in 8 h note that agents have only harvesting labor requirement unlike water use farmers do not hire workers more than they need 2 4 4 evaluation of land preparation paddy growth and harvesting stages to adjust the cropping schedule evaluating equations for land preparation the paddy growth and the harvesting stages were created the length of the land preparation stage is determined by water resource availability that of the harvesting stage is determined by harvesting labor availability and that of the paddy growth stage is fixed at 90 days or 9 time steps these three stages are evaluated as follows the land preparation stage evaluation e lp is calculated using eqs 7 8 and 9 7 e lp ti lp tr lp 8 ti lp i lp 1 i lp 2 i lp n lp i 1 n lp i lp i 9

and the following cropping seasons only if n hv 4 and e hv 1 then all requirements of one rice cultivation cycle are met to have a rice cropping 2 4 5 game theoretic approach to assess strategy combinations the subaks in the study area were seemingly rational and self centeredly attempted to maximize their annual rice production and subak a and the other subaks had different characteristics this condition can be translated into a noncooperative game of two players supposing player 1 is agent a1 and a2 and player 2 is agent b c d and e on the subak level when paddy becomes ready to be harvested a rice cultivation subsequently enters the harvesting stage it suggests that harvesting labor allocation order is similar to the water allocation order because water allocation order results from cooperative adjusting behavior among downstream subaks the existing harvesting labor allocation order can be considered as a consequence of cooperative behavior although subaks follow long lasting cooperative water management practices the cooperative resources allocation may not be outweighed in the future currently individual farmers need to handle with harvesting however because of economies of scale a subak with the larger paddy fields may become easier to collect harvesting labor resource this condition will allocate harvesting labor supply un cooperatively in the area based on this projection the noncooperative game was formulated two players of this game have the cooperative strategy and the noncooperative strategy which hereinafter are denoted as cs and ns respectively the strategy combination is written for example cs ns when player 1 chooses the cooperative strategy and player 2 chooses the noncooperative strategy and all strategy combinations are cs cs cs ns ns cs and ns ns when a player chooses the cooperative strategy the order of harvesting labor allocation among agents of such a player is determined by distance from the weir an agent closest to the weir is allowed to gain harvesting labor supply first and the second turn goes to an agent which is the second closest to the weir an agent recognizes its turn after the prior agent gains when one player chooses the noncooperative strategy the order of harvesting labor allocation among agents of such a player is determined by the paddy field size an agent possessing largest paddy fields is allowed to access to harvesting labor supply first and the second turn goes to an agent with the second largest sizes if two agents have the same paddy field sizes an agent closer to the weir has the prior turn than the other if the arrangements mentioned above cannot specify which agent is prior to the other the prior turn is given to an agent closer to the weir for example when it is cs ns agents a1 and a2 have the cooperative strategy and agents b to e have the noncooperative strategy between agents a1 and d agent a1 is closer to the weir than agent d thus agent a1 gains before agent d these four orders of harvesting labor allocation and the order of water allocation are illustrated in fig 5 contrary to harvesting labor allocation this game has the only one order of water allocation as described in fig 5 agents a1 and a2 first withdraw at once followed by secondary agents b and c then by agent d and at the end agent e to understand influence of harvesting labor supply on water management three harvesting labor scenarios of all labor scenarios were named scenarios 1 2 and 3 scenario 1 has 760 harvesting workers which allows the six agents to harvest simultaneously in 10 days scenario 2 has 228 harvesting workers which satisfies 30 of the requirement for simultaneous 10 day harvesting or 89 of the requirement for simultaneous 30 day harvesting scenario 3 has 86 harvesting workers which satisfies 11 of the requirement for simultaneous 10 day harvesting or 45 of the requirement for simultaneous 40 day harvesting in another way 86 harvesting workers are the minimal requirement for 30 day harvesting of agent a2 whose paddy fields are the largest among all agents in this study simulations of a strategy combination ran with three harvesting labor scenarios until each cropping schedule of the agents converged while four year rainfall data table 3 were iteratively utilized as rain a strategy combination with a scenario ran 100 times and results such as annual rice production the number of days of the stages were averaged for analysis the annual rice productions of strategy combinations were compared and four strategy combinations in a scenario were evaluated using two concepts pareto optimality and the nash equilibrium table 5 a strategy combination is pareto optimal if no other strategy combination exists where one player can do better without decreasing annual rice production of the other often it generates the largest total annual rice production among four strategy combinations or provides at least one of the players with the highest annual rice production among four strategy combinations a strategy combination is a nash equilibrium if both players make the best choice to generate the highest annual rice production based on their belief in this model water use behavior of the agents aims to maximize the annual rice production in the study area the rice yield was determined mainly by how much rainfall and irrigation water were obtained as fig 2 shows after the rainy season peaks the amount of rainfall decreased month by month and thus as shown in fig 3 the volume of the intake weir decreased in the dry season because of this rainfall pattern the later that the rice cropping season starts the less rainfall and irrigation water such a rice cropping season receives this can cause a decline in annual rice production this study s model replicates this relationship between the rainfall pattern and rice production 3 results 3 1 the current resource allocation based on field research results the ideal cropping schedule in the model is triple rice cropping consisting of oct 1st as the first starting date 2 time step land preparation and 1 time step harvesting as shown table 2 in the formulation of this noncooperative game cs cs is the current resource allocation to examine simulation outcomes of cs cs the cropping schedules of six agents in three harvesting labor scenarios were compared with the ideal cropping schedule abm is designed to imitate the existing water allocation of the study area emerging from subaks cropping schedule development process in this model agents have the cropping schedule development process listed in table 2 and cropping schedules are decided by rainfall withdrawn river water and harvesting labor conditions because hydrological conditions such as rainfall and the intake weir of the model are similar to the status quo with sufficient harvesting labor upstream agents such as agents a1 and b can have the ideal cropping schedule whereas downstream agents such as agents d and e may have a double or single rice cropping schedule among downstream agents because the water supply is lower than that of the previous agent an agent would be required to set the first starting date later and or extend the duration of the land preparation and the harvesting stage downstream agents such as agent e who are at the tail end of the water supply network may exhibit significant difference in the number of days between the simulation outcome and the ideal cropping schedule in fig 6 the stacked bar graph shows differences in the number of days between the simulation outcomes and the ideal cropping schedule and the line graph shows the annual rice production of three harvesting labor scenarios in scenario 1 harvesting labor supply was sufficient for all six agents whereas it was not in scenarios 2 and 3 the outcomes of scenario 1 demonstrate that upstream agents such as agents a1 and b had the ideal cropping schedule and that downstream agents such as agents a2 c d and e set the first starting date later than the previous agent agent e had a longer time for land preparation stage than agent d these results indicate that the abm of this study replicated the water allocation mechanism of the study area appropriately when harvesting labor supply was insufficient compared with the ideal cropping schedule overall the first starting date was set later and the harvesting took longer whereas the length of the land preparation had little change this tendency results from the cropping schedule development process as represented by fig 4 the harvesting stage is evaluated at the end in the process of adjusting a rice cultivation cycle thus the existing cropping schedule development process tends to extend the duration of the harvesting stage rather than the land preparation stage decrease in the annual rice production happened when the harvesting needed more time than the previous scenario this change was observed in agents b c d and e except agent a2 agent a2 had the same rice production even though double cropping schedules varied in each harvesting scenario this indicates that a cropping schedule was determined by hydrological condition and the availability of labor resource in the next section harvesting labor allocation and rice production are evaluated 3 2 impact of strategy combinations on annual rice production table 6 lists annual rice production for four strategy combinations in three harvesting labor scenarios table 7 lists strategy combinations that are pareto optimal or have a nash equilibrium in scenario 1 in which sufficient harvesting labor was provided the game did not have a nash equilibrium and ns ns was pareto optimal this result means that ns ns provides optimally high annual rice production but it may not be chosen because it is not nash equilibrium in scenario 2 which featured limited harvesting labor ns ns was the unique nash equilibrium and cs cs cs ns and ns ns were all pareto optimal ns ns in this scenario will be stably chosen because it is one of the pareto optimal outcomes and nash equilibrium as well in scenario 3 which featured scarce harvesting labor ns ns was the unique nash equilibrium and cs cs and ns ns were pareto optimal like scenario 2 ns ns will be consistently the best choice in an individual player s perspective table 6 shows that player 1 did not have a strictly dominant strategy in any scenarios whereas for player 2 noncooperation was the strictly dominant strategy in all three scenarios this reasons that cs cs won t be a solution in three scenarios as the harvesting labor supply decreased annual rice production declined whichever strategy combinations were chosen for sustainable irrigation facilities and water cooperative water use is ideal in scenarios 1 and 2 the difference in annual rice production between cs cs and the others was within 5 in scenario 3 the difference in annual rice production between cs cs and ns cs or ns ns was within 3 whereas between cs cs and cs ns it was 17 this suggests that using cooperative resource use especially harvesting labor resource has little negative impact on annual rice production to explore the impact of various strategy combinations on annual rice production for three scenarios the seasonal rice production of cs cs cs ns ns cs and ns ns of each agent is compared in fig 7 in scenario 1 fig 7a differences of strategy combinations did not change rice cropping intensity of all the agents but slightly changed the occurrence rate of triple rice cropping of agent d due to water shortage it caused a negligible variation in the total rice production among four strategy combinations in scenario 2 fig 7b the position in the harvesting labor allocation order mattered to the third cropping season of agent d in cs ns unlike the other strategy combinations agent d which had the second position in the harvesting labor allocation order had triple rice cropping in some occurrences of 100 iterations under that condition agent e could have the maximum yield in the second rice cropping season however agent a2 whose paddy fields were the largest of all agents had the second latest position in the harvesting labor allocation order because of their inferior position and limited shortage in the harvesting labor supply agent a2 was unable to have a second rice cropping season an increase in the annual rice production of agents d and e surpassed the decline in rice production of agent a2 and cs ns became the most prolific strategic combination however differences in the total annual rice production among pareto optimal outcomes were minor in scenario 3 fig 7c cs cs was one of the pareto optimal outcomes ns ns was the unique nash equilibrium and a pareto optimal outcome and cs ns generated the lowest total annual rice production a noticeable difference between cs cs and ns ns was that either agent a1 or b had a triple rice cropping pattern the two agents paddy fields were similar in size and smaller than those of other four agents this similarity generates a marginal difference in annual rice production between cs cs and ns ns as shown in table 6 in cs ns the severe harvesting labor supply shortage prevented agents d and e from enjoying their positional advantage as they did in scenario 2 and agent a2 was unable to have a second rice cropping season moreover agent a2 s lower cropping intensity did not provide the other agents a sufficient harvesting labor supply to increase rice cropping intensity due to the harvesting labor allocation order these conditions caused a significant difference in the annual rice production between cs ns and the other strategy combinations this indicates that with a severe harvesting labor supply shortage a harvesting labor allocation order could compound declines in annual rice production 4 discussion 4 1 implication of strategy combinations for a resolving water related conflict this study employed noncooperative game theory approach to draw insights from rice cultivation management practices identified by stakeholder analysis approach madani 2010 in the game a nash equilibrium reveals a strategy combination that the players believe is the best choice for yielding high annual rice production and thus such a strategy combination is more than likely to be chosen as a solution a pareto optimal outcome reveals a strategy combination that is the most productive for the entire area in all scenarios of this game the noncooperative strategy was strictly dominant for player 2 which consists of downstream agents such as agents b c d and e it means that in all scenarios possible outcomes were only ns ns and cs ns when the harvesting labor supply was sufficient e g scenario 1 a nash equilibrium did not exist and a pareto optimal outcome was ns ns in this scenario annual rice cultivation of player 1 which consists of upstream agents such as agents a1 and a2 was the same in the four strategy combinations if player 1 is unconcerned about the entire area both cs and ns are their choices and the annual rice production of player 2 will depend on player 1 s decision it represents a water conflict structure observed in the irrigation system outcomes of downstream agents vary depending on upstream agents while upstream agents can have consistently a desirable outcome with any strategies when the harvesting labor supply was insufficient e g scenarios 2 and 3 ns ns was the unique nash equilibrium and pareto optimal the non cooperative strategy was the best for player 1 and 2 and the entire area as well whereas although cs cs was a pareto optimal outcome in scenarios 2 and 3 it would never happen because of player 2 to make cs cs is a solution for this game the cooperative strategy needs to be more beneficial for player 2 in actual management downstream subaks such as subaks b c d and e choose the cooperative strategy from the perspective of both individual subaks and the entire study area an analysis of strategy combinations suggests that current rice cultivation management practices may not be devised to maximize rice production rather management practices could be designed to maintain conditional cooperative relationships between subaks this is supported by the field research results like other subak systems lorenzen 2006 subaks in the study area sometimes informally negotiate water use timing and when both sides agree they diverge from management practices to help each other such cooperative relationships should be beneficial for all subaks although they are conditional because irrigated rice production relies heavily on rainfall with patterns that change every year in addition to the erratic climate increasing reliance on outsourced harvesting labor and a shortage of harvesting workers make the duration of harvesting more unpredictable such tight interactions between subaks could also play a role in mutual monitoring ostrom 1990 to indirectly facilitate more efficient water use and sustain multiple rice cultivation each year therefore flexible management practices with room for negotiation could contribute to strengthening cooperative relationships as well as the resilience of irrigation water management systems farmers still embrace balinese hindu philosophy called tri hita karana to maintain traditional rice cultivation systems norken 2019 however as tourism and other nonfarming jobs develop further rice cultivation will change more and the value held by farmers in cultivating rice will be less lorenzen and lorenzen 2011 strauss 2011 the model of this study simply incorporated the harvesting process but it was enough to project that the shortage of harvesting labor supply could accelerate noncooperative behavior among farmers and consequently rice production of the entire area could decrease further research on harvesting labor supply systems is required to better understand harvesting labor supply impact on rice cultivation 4 2 insight into the sustainability of irrigation water management the model outcomes described that resources for rice production such as rainfall withdrawn river water and harvesting labor were consumed by users aligned along a main canal this points out that a user s resource consumption influenced that of the following users additionally water users in irrigated paddy fields formed a cropping schedule to fit their resource use into supply variability this indicates that the process to create a cropping schedule was an adaptation to hydrological and demographic changes this cropping schedule development process was similar to kuil et al 2018 their model showed that an equilibrium cropping pattern emerged from water availability perceived by farmers they concluded that wuas water use represented the adaptability to external conditions such as climate change in the study area of this study resources allocation practices strengthened cooperative relationships between subaks a and subaks b to e which was more important than resource use efficiency for rice productivity this study focuses on the influence of transitioning from a communal to an outsourced harvesting labor supply and simulation outcomes indicate that the noncooperative strategy for collecting harvesting labor was more beneficial especially for downstream subaks however currently upstream and downstream subaks seemed to have the cooperative strategy while downstream subaks such as subaks d and e complained about subak a s indifference to downstream subaks leaving the status quo would lead to a severer water conflict or abandoned paddy fields among downstream farmers this expectation is not a negligible event for indonesia striving for food security world food programme 2022 subak systems which is a special type of pim systems in bali indonesia have developed tight cooperative relationships by for example exchanged labor custom for centuries lorenzen and lorenzen 2011 talhelm and english 2020 however their management is getting less cooperative because of outsourced harvesting labor in bali to change their resources allocation system to be beneficial for the entire area new cooperative relationship needs to be built up the heads of the subaks were aware that the harvesting stage took longer than before but none attempted to implement any countermeasures against the harvesting labor shortage this result confirms prior studies subak systems only regulate the water supply geertz 1980 even if farmers tried to cooperatively manage harvesting this is no longer a community level issue because harvesting workers migrate between districts regencies and islands this is therefore a larger issue between bali and other islands and between the rice and labor industries another issue threatening the sustainability of balinese rice cultivation is climate change since rice production is likely to decrease as a result takama et al 2017 this encourages farmers to establish new water use strategies to maintain rice production despite rainfall patterns change notably these two urgent issues are both social issues berkes 2017 to cope with the social issues impacting irrigation water management balinese farmers need to transform subak systems using flexible water allocation management practices as shown this paper balinese farmers can develop new management systems adaptive to social change however farmers will need to work with other communities local and national authorities and other industries to address social issues this suggests that sustainable rice cultivation in bali will require government intervention to solve social issues the government can manage allocation of migrant harvesting workers to proceed harvesting efficiently additionally agricultural and infrastructure improvements undertaken in japan and south korea show that the governmental contribution to for example subsidies for agricultural machinery introduction land consolidation and drainage improvement for agricultural machinery utilization and road construction for eliminating travel time and transporting agricultural machinery can help improve resource use efficiency as well im et al 2016 koshiyama 2019 balinese irrigation systems have a government assisted federation so called subak gede lorenzen and lorenzen 2005 subak gede is a coordination agency for multiple subaks sharing an irritation infrastructure to aim for better irrigation management on a large area the study area also had subak gede but the heads of the subaks considered it was more nominal the results of this study indicate that the cooperative strategy for harvesting labor allocation was the most productive for the entire area under severe harvesting labor shortage because farmers still values rice cultivation keeping the cooperative strategy would be attractive under subak gede subaks can discuss about sharing limited harvesting labor supply as access to the governmental help such as information on labor and subsidies for harvesting machinery governmental support can improve resources allocation through changing cropping schedule development process more adaptive to the issues that subaks are confronting this study shows that abm and game theory are useful to develop water allocation scenarios based on the state quo whose land use climatic and demographic conditions are changing although the model outcomes themselves did not explain what motivation downstream subaks had to choose the cooperative strategy by analyzing the model outcomes the status quo scenario was able to be evaluated when government intervention installs infrastructure and or rules for resource allocation in the future the model can be used to propose the most efficient resource allocation plans to achieve their goal finding motivation of downstream subaks to choose the cooperative strategy will help researchers understand farmers values leading to cooperative behavior for better understanding of the study area agents need to include not only subaks but also other entities such as the local government and labor market to estimate the future rice production more accurately the model should be run with rainfall projections 5 conclusions water related conflict in the irrigation sector has been compounded with climate change and population dynamics although irrigation management transfer imt and participatory irrigation management pim have been implemented to achieve sustainable irrigation infrastructure management pim imt studies have found that institutional arrangement has issues to resolve conflicts between water users associations wuas agent based model is used to analyze conflicts and game theory is employed to analyze rules and practices found in places where conflicts existed this study discussed the applicability of abm and game theory to analyze conflicts over surface irrigation water and harvesting labor and proposed transforming resource supply system to resolve water related conflicts increased by resource depletion under urbanization as a case study of successful pim implementations subak balinese wuas was chosen the simulation outcomes indicate that abm can replicate the water allocation mechanism and social issues such as harvesting labor supply could compound the decrease in rice productivity from an analysis of strategy combinations we determined that flexible rice cultivation management practices afforded room for negotiation and should contribute to strengthening the cooperative relationships between subaks however as the society changes rice cultivation is losing its value held by farmers in bali thus as the analysis indicates farmers behavior may become noncooperative to maintain cooperative relationships between wuas threatened by the pressure of social changes this study also established that governmental intervention will be necessary to control island level social conditions because social issues are seemingly beyond the capability of subak systems to control to efficiently use resources decreased by social changes subak will need to build new cooperative relationships and mechanization and modernization of irrigation systems will be inevitable to improve resource use efficiency abm and game theory can help acknowledge social changes affecting production and support discussions by providing an analysis result of resource allocation rules and scenarios for better understanding of conflicts found in piim imt studies in socio hydrological approach influencing resources on water supply and demand such as labor land fertilizer and agricultural machinery should be investigated funding this work was supported by grants in aid for
